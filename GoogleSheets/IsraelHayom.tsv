Israel concessions 'neither end war nor compromise achievements'	The IDF is preparing to implement a potential hostage deal, including force redeployment during the ceasefire and aid deliveries, contingent on Hamas' approval in intensive Qatar negotiations that progressed on Sunday. The talks, featuring Mossad Chief David Barnea, Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar, and retired Major General Nitzan Alon, focus on a phased agreement framework. According to foreign reports, the first phase involves Israel's demand for the return of 33 hostages, as reported by the BBC last week, in exchange for a 42-day ceasefire. In discussions with Israel Hayom, a senior security official emphasized that Israel remains firm on not committing to war termination within the deal's framework. 'The current deal structure preserves our ability to resume military operations,' the source stated. The official highlighted Israel's unwavering stance on maintaining an Israeli presence along the Philadelphi Corridor during the ceasefire – both positions previously rejected by Hamas. A diplomatic source acknowledged progress in Qatar discussions while noting remaining gaps. 'The concessions we're considering neither end the war nor compromise its achievements,' the official concluded. This stance underlies political assessments suggesting both Religious Zionism Chairman Bezalel Smotrich and Otzma Yehudit leader Itamar Ben-Gvir will ultimately endorse the emerging agreement. The deal faces challenges in both Qatar and Jerusalem regarding prisoners who will be released, IDF withdrawal from the Netzarim Corridor throughout the ceasefire, and the relocation of serious offenders to foreign countries. Mossad Chief David Barnea and Qatari Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al-Thani (Gideon Markowicz / Salim MATRAMKOT / AFP) Qatar discussions also address establishing a screening mechanism for northern Gaza returns, with Israel transferring screening authority to a foreign entity instead of the IDF. Another key focus is securing commitment to continue negotiations for the second phase – complete hostage return – beginning in the third week of the first phase's implementation. Regarding military positioning during the ceasefire, foreign reports indicate Israel's agreement to maintain partial presence in the Philadelphi Corridor, withdraw from the Netzarim Corridor, and position forces around Gaza's perimeter. Concurrent with Qatar negotiations, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu initiated individual meetings with potential opposition to the proposed framework. Despite having secured majority support in the governing coalition, Netanyahu seeks to maintain government unity. This motivated his separate evening consultations with Ben-Gvir and Smotrich to reaffirm deal red lines designed to preserve coalition stability regardless of voting positions.

Abbas' son to pay Israeli researcher after suing for NIS 500,000	The Jerusalem District Court rejected today (Sunday) an appeal by Tareq Abbas, son of Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), in a defamation lawsuit against Middle East expert Dr. Reuven Berko. Abbas, who sought damages of NIS 500,000 ($141,000) regarding a television interview given by Berko, will now be required to pay legal expenses of NIS 20,000 ($5,640). The case centered on an Arabic language interview where Dr. Berko discussed Tareq Abbas' business activities. Berko asserted that he owns multiple companies and characterized the Abbas family as 'full of money.' He further stated that 'without security coordination, their presence in the Authority's territory would be short-lived,' and claimed that Abbas' family members 'arrived here with nothing and became millionaires.' In a detailed verdict, Judge Ram Winograd, Vice President of the District Court, found that the lawsuit relied solely on edited portions of the original interview, downloaded from a Gaza news site. 'The alteration of how statements were made, and potentially their sequence and substance, prevents the court from evaluating the publication as a whole,' the judge wrote. Dr. Reuven Berko A crucial aspect of the ruling addressed Tareq Abbas' allegation that the statements portrayed him as collaborating with Israel. The court firmly rejected this claim, stating that Israeli courts do not consider statements about cooperation with Israel as defamatory. Judge Winograd stated: 'This claim cannot be sustained as an Israeli court cannot view such expressions as defamation.' The proceedings revealed that contrary to Abbas' initial assertion, the interview was not aired on an Israeli channel but was distributed through a Gaza news site. Berko maintained that in the complete interview, he had actually commended the Abbas family, and his statements were presented without proper context. Judges Shoshana Leibowitz and Tamar Bar-Asher concurred with Judge Winograd's decision. Attorney Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, president of the 'Shurat HaDin' organization representing Berko, commented: 'This is another failed attempt at silencing by Abu Mazen's [Mahmoud Abbas] son. Let all those who wish us harm and try to intimidate our rights, especially in these days, know that justice is on our side, and it will ultimately come to light.'

Israel seizes billions in shock PA debt maneuver	The Finance Ministry has offset all electricity debts of the Palestinian Authority – 1.1 billion shekels ($310 million) – while simultaneously emptying the Norwegian fund where Palestinian Authority-destined funds had been deposited since the start of the war. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich led this initiative throughout the past year and on Sunday told the Diplomatic-Security Cabinet the completion of the process – collecting the entire debt that had stood 1.9 billion shekels ($515 million) for over a decade. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Oren Ben-Hakoon) Additionally, and no less significantly, the Finance Ministry on Sunday issued an order to the Norwegian fund, where Israel had deposited millions deducted from PA funds earmarked for the Gaza Strip (275 million shekels monthly or $74 million), totaling some 1.4 billion shekels accumulated until May ($379 million). This money will cover PA debts to Israeli companies: Half will go to companies that supplied fuel to the Palestinian Authority and half to the Israel Electric Corporation. Since last May, when Norway announced its unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state, Minister Smotrich also stopped transferring the offset funds to the Norwegian fund and began accumulating the amount separately in Israel. Now, the sum that was supposedly meant to return to the PA after the war from both the fund and Israel is being transferred to cover debts to the Israel Electric Corporation in coordination with the US. The behind-the-scenes negotiations on this matter with the PA and various American entities were led by Finance Ministry deputy director-general. The latter succeeded where his predecessors failed: transferring the money in full, without reducing late payment interest, from PA funds to the Israel Electric Corporation. The PA's debt to the Israel Electric Corporation has been an ongoing issue for Israel for 15 years. Former Finance Ministry Director-General Shai Babad reached two agreements in 2016 and 2020 with the PA to settle the rolling debt, but these were repeatedly violated by the Authority. As we reported in September 2023, Smotrich, in his role as finance minister, began reducing the rolling debt by associating the Jerusalem District Electricity Company with the PA , thus stopping the debt from growing every two months and fixing it at 1.9 billion shekels. Since then, in July and November of last year, a total of approximately 700 million shekels were collected from the Authority. Today, this historic collection process reached its peak and conclusion – 1.1 billion shekels will be cleared in full and the money will be transferred to the Israel Electric Corporation, partly from the Norwegian fund and partly from funds accumulated in Israel. After reaching agreements with US Ambassador Thomas Nides and preventing the use of accumulated funds in the Norwegian fund for Palestinian purposes, Norway will receive a letter requesting the funds from the Accountant General, from there to pay various debts. Despite American demands for interest rate discounts, the Finance Ministry refused to compromise even one shekel, understanding that such 'discounts' are a negative incentive that no Israeli citizen receives. A deadline was also set for the first time with the Americans: transferring the budget in Israel without indirectly rolling additional burdens onto citizens due to the debt held by the Israel Electric Corporation. The fact that the Biden administration boycotted the Israeli finance minister played in favor of the matter, as the absence of relations meant the absence of obligation to respond to their demands on Palestinian issues. The diplomatic gain means that the Palestinian Authority was indirectly forced to pay the debt it had been rolling over year after year. This is also a significant economic event as the PA's debt to the Israel Electric Corporation led to loans and high interest rates as well as damage to the Israel Electric Corporation's credit rating, which ultimately rolled over to citizens.

Biden signals major progress in hostage negotiations	President Joe Biden delivered a promising update on the hostage deal negotiations between Israel and Hamas and the Gaza ceasefire discussions overnight (between Thursday and Friday), declaring that 'real progress' has been achieved, with the possibility of completion before Jan. 20. The outgoing president revealed he had met earlier with key negotiators while identifying Hamas as the current obstacle to finalizing the deal. Despite the challenge, Biden maintained his optimistic outlook, emphasizing that he believes 'we should be able to reach an agreement.' In a separate diplomatic development, Biden mentioned his conversation with Lebanon's new president, Joseph Aoun, whom he praised as 'the right leader' for the country. US President Joe Biden (EPA/Jim Watson) In a parallel development, families of the hostages convened Thursday with Gal Hirsch, the Prime Minister's Office coordinator for captives and missing persons. During the meeting, Hirsch assured family representatives that despite its phased implementation, the agreement under discussion in Qatar encompasses all hostages. He further emphasized the ongoing coordination with both the outgoing and incoming US administrations to ensure seamless continuity as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to assume office. The diplomatic momentum continued as President Isaac Herzog met with Cyprus President Nikos Christodoulides in Nicosia Thursday, where discussions included the international community's efforts to secure the hostages' return.

Report: US, UK, Israel conduct joint strikes in Yemen	Arab media outlets reported an unprecedented military operation Friday, marking the first coordinated strikes by US, British, and Israeli forces since the escalation of regional hostilities. According to international sources, the operation comprised three waves of strikes targeting critical infrastructure across Houthi-controlled territories. The operation, totaling approximately 30 strikes, focused on several strategic locations: underground military installations in the Amran governorate, military complexes in Sanaa, a power generation facility south of the capital, and the strategic western ports of Al-Hudaydah and Ras Issa. Hamas terrorists take part in an anti-Israel rally in the Gaza Strip, May 22, 2021 (Reuters/Mohammed Salem) A mass pro-Hamas demonstration took place in Sanaa concurrent with the military operation. Participants rallied behind the Shia-Zaidi terror movement's ideological slogan, chanting 'Death to America, Death to Israel, Curse upon the Jews, Victory for Islam.' Eyewitness documentation captured smoke plumes rising from multiple strike locations across the capital. Responding to the operation, Nasreddin Amer, a representative of the Houthi propaganda apparatus, confirmed strikes in 'the Seventieth Square vicinity in Sanaa' during the Hamas demonstration.

Army chief walking a tight rope: Meet Lebanon's leading president...	Lebanese Army Commander Joseph Aoun has emerged as the leading contender for Lebanon's presidency, with opposition factions coalescing around his candidacy in a rare show of consensus. The decisive parliamentary session, scheduled for Thursday, comes as Aoun has secured support from 74 of 128 parliament members. The path to presidency, however, faces a constitutional hurdle. As a general, Aoun must overcome a mandatory two-year 'cooling period,' requiring 86 votes for a constitutional amendment. To bridge this gap, he needs either partial support from the Amal-Hezbollah alliance (31 votes) or backing from the Free Patriotic Movement (13 votes). Video: Compilation footage of the Beirut explosion A significant breakthrough came with the withdrawal of Suleiman Frangieh, Hezbollah's initial candidate from the Marada Movement party. While Frangieh's party holds only two seats, his endorsement of Aoun signals a potential shift in Hezbollah's stance. Sky News reports an agreement between Hezbollah and Amal to support Aoun, though no official announcement has been made. Born in 1964 in San Fil, Mount Lebanon governorate, Aoun's military career began in 1983 when he joined the Lebanese Army as a cadet. His rise to army commander in 2017 was marked by extensive military education, including counter-terrorism training in the US. Early in his command, he successfully led operations against ISIS in the eastern Bekaa Valley. Aoun's leadership style emerged clearly during Lebanon's cascading crises, including the 2020 Beirut port explosion. He maintained neutrality while navigating relationships with Hezbollah, protesters, the US, and Arab nations. This approach, while earning broad support, drew criticism from the Free Patriotic Movement during protests against then-President Michel Aoun. Beyond his military credentials, Aoun holds bachelor's degrees in political science and military science. Fluent in Arabic, English, and French, he is known in Lebanese media as an intellectual who often quotes Sun Tzu's 'The Art of War.' His diplomatic skills and strategic mindset have become hallmarks of his leadership approach.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/01/09/army-chief-walking-a-tight-rope-meet-lebanons-leading-presidential-candidate/	2025-01-08T22:20:38-08:00	
Hamas sells aid to Gazans, uses profits to pay operatives	Hamas continues to pay its operatives regular salaries 15 months into the war, despite Israeli cabinet efforts to dismantle its governing infrastructure, security sources confirmed to Israel Hayom. The organization has established a systematic operation of intercepting humanitarian aid shipments destined for Gaza residents. Armed operatives commandeer supply trucks carrying internationally funded cargo transported by the IDF, then resell essential supplies at premium prices to the local population. 'The resale of international aid has become their dominant revenue stream,' a senior security official told Israel Hayom. These proceeds finance both existing operatives' salaries and new recruitment efforts targeting Gaza youth. A truck carrying fuel decorated with a UN flag crosses into Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, Nov. 15, 2023 (Said Khatib/AFP) While the closure of the Philadelphi Corridor and suspension of private commerce has eliminated major funding channels, the official noted that 'Hamas maintains its recruitment capabilities through aid-generated revenue.' The political establishment, while broadly aligned on the need to revise current aid policies, has yet to develop concrete plans for implementation following Donald Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. Defense Minister Israel Katz, who championed the initial Gaza blockade following Hamas' Oct. 7 assault, had declared, 'For years we provided Gaza with electricity, water and fuel, and instead of gratitude, they dispatched thousands of human animals to slaughter, murder, rape and kidnap babies, women and elderly. We've halted these supplies, and their local power plant has failed. We'll maintain pressure until the Hamas threat is eliminated.' However, the blockade strategy collapsed under Biden administration pressure and concerns over potential disruptions to American ammunition supplies. Israel's leadership now anticipates that Trump – who recently warned that unless the hostages were released before he is sworn in, 'there will be all hell to pay in the Middle East' – may be more receptive to significant reductions in Gaza's aid supply.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/01/09/humanitarian-absurdity-hamas-sells-aid-to-gazans-uses-profits-to-pay-operatives/	2025-01-08T22:14:29-08:00	
IDF recovers hostage Yosef AlZayadni's body from Gaza	The Israel Defense Forces announced the recovery of hostage Yosef AlZayadni's remains from an underground tunnel in Rafah Tuesday, facilitating the return of his body to Israel. The statement confirmed that Yosef, who was taken hostage on Oct. 7, 2023, died while in captivity. During the same recovery operation, security forces discovered evidence connected to his son, Hamza AlZayadni, who was also abducted on Oct. 7, leading to serious concerns about his survival. The military statement indicated the evidence was located in the southern Gaza Strip. Following the recovery, Yosef's remains were transported by helicopter to the forensic institute for detailed examination.

Iran orders mass evacuation near nuclear reactor	Iranian authorities issued an urgent evacuation order today Wednesday affecting civilian populations residing within a 3.1-mile radius of the Bushehr nuclear reactor, one of the nation's most sensitive nuclear installations. According to reports from the Iranian news agency IRNA, the spokesperson for the Bushehr region announced that all facility personnel and civilian residents in the reactor zone, particularly emphasizing foreign nationals, must evacuate the designated area immediately. The evacuation order extends to four residential neighborhoods adjacent to the power station.

In a related development, Nasratolah Saif, deputy commander of the Revolutionary Guard's Basij militia, revealed that the organization will implement 'security patrols' across various regions of the country to safeguard sensitive sites against potential foreign intervention. Speaking to the Tasnim news agency, Saif indicated that enhanced drills and surveillance operations are planned throughout all regions of the country.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/01/08/iran-orders-mass-evacuation-near-nuclear-reactor/	2025-01-08T00:00:09-08:00	
Israel concerned over Turkish moves in Syria	Turkey's attempt to turn Syria into a client state, replacing Iran and Russia as key influencers, is a growing concern for Israeli officials. A senior political source in Jerusalem confessed that Turkey's activities in Syria have become a top priority in recent days. This concern is evident: Two critical discussions are scheduled in the coming days by Israeli leadership: one at the Defense Ministry, and another led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Israeli officials view Turkey's moves in Syria as carrying 'the potential for heavy friction between the two countries.' Israel is preparing for the possibility of Turkey becoming a strategic threat, as reflected in the The Nagel Commission's report. The Commission, established to formulate recommendations on Israel's force building needs and security budget in the coming decade, mentioned Turkey 15 times in the report, highlighting regional instability and the potential for rapid changes, including attempts to destabilize the Jordanian monarchy, shifts in Egyptian and Turkish approaches, and rising friction with Israel. Erdogan and Al-Julani, Photo: Reuters, AFP One section of the report explicitly warns the prime minister about the risks: 'The problem will escalate if Syrian forces effectively become a 'Turkish proxy,' as part of Turkey's ambition to restore Ottoman-era influence. The presence of Turkish forces or their proxies in Syria could heighten the risk of a direct Israel-Turkey confrontation.' What could lead to this scenario? The Turkish military's entry into Syria, which could result in the rapid arming of the country, and military actions against the Kurds in the country's east, potentially spilling over to Israel's doorstep. This threat is described by the Commission as a 'potential for drastic change' in relations with Turkey, a country with which Israel maintains ongoing diplomatic ties, albeit currently based solely on mutual interests. Turkish forces near the border with Syria. Photo: AFP In response to the tectonic shifts in Syria, Western countries are rushing to build bridges with the new regime. Recently, the foreign ministers of Germany and France visited Damascus. Moreover, there is a growing trend in Western capitals, including Washington, to remove the main rebel group in the new government, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), from the list of terrorist organizations. 'We cannot afford to do otherwise,' Western officials explained to senior Israeli figures regarding their approach to the group, which was previously affiliated with al-Qaeda. Concerns for the fate of the Kurds Israel's concerns can be divided into two main issues. The first is the continued smuggling of weapons through Lebanon under the auspices of the new Syrian regime. The second is Erdogan's potential exploitation of the situation to crush the autonomous Kurdish rule in eastern Syria, which could result in a massacre of the Kurdish population in the region. In a recent statement on the matter, Erdogan vowed to 'bury in the ground, with their weapons, those who choose terror and violence,' referring to the Kurdish militias in the area. The Kurds have a long-standing relationship with Israel, but Israeli officials emphasize that Israel does not seek direct confrontation with Turkey. The issue of military protection for Kurdish autonomy in Syria is considered a responsibility of the US. Kurdish fighters after their victory over ISIS in Syria (archive). Photo: Reuters Immediately after Assad's fall, the IDF outlined two possible scenarios for Syria: one in which the country would be ruled by al-Julani (Ahmed Hussein al-Sharaa, leader of HTS), or a division of the country into cantons with varying levels of autonomy. The latter scenario is Israel's preferred outcome. In practice, Israeli officials say Turkey has become the most influential power in Damascus, replacing Iran's Shiite axis with a Sunni-Turkish alignment. While this alignment is not yet seen as an outright adversary, it may offer safe harbor for terrorist groups. 'The arena is multidimensional,' a senior diplomat noted. 'Turkey's interests in turning Syria into a client state, thereby bolstering its regional influence, are clear. Our response includes on-the-ground actions and preparing for potential threats that could escalate rapidly.' A counter-alliance to the Sultan? Amid public statements in support of the Kurds, Israel is strengthening ties with Turkey's historical rivals. In recent months, Israel signed a series of defense agreements with Greece and Cyprus, including a €2 billion deal involving advanced radar and interception systems for Greece. Cyprus has already received Israeli-made Barak MX air defense missiles to replace its Russian systems. In contrast, Israel's unique relationship with Azerbaijan, marked by advanced arms sales and substantial oil imports via Turkey, adds another layer of complexity. Israeli weapons played a crucial role in Azerbaijan's victory over Armenia in Nagorno-Karabakh. Given Turkey's close alliance with Azerbaijan, tensions between Jerusalem and Ankara could test these ties as well.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/01/08/israel-concerned-over-turkish-moves-in-syria/	2025-01-07T23:59:02-08:00	
Complaint filed against IDF soldier in Argentina	The Hind Rajab Foundation filed a legal complaint Tuesday against the soldier wanted in Brazil who fled to Argentina, following a federal court's investigation order regarding suspected involvement in murder and crimes against humanity. Additionally, it was revealed Tuesday that another war crimes complaint, including charges of crimes against humanity and genocide, was filed last week in Argentina against a second Israeli soldier, a Givati Brigade fighter. They indicate they have evidence to support these claims. Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip (IDF Spokesperson's Unit) The Hind Rajab Foundation was established in September 2024 in Brussels as a nonprofit organization, named after a Palestinian child allegedly killed by the IDF during Operation Iron Swords. The foundation is a branch of the March 30 Movement, which has been active for more than three decades in legal pursuit of IDF soldiers. The foundation collects publicly available information online about IDF soldiers, including information about military operations they participated in, with the aim of prosecuting these soldiers in foreign countries. To date, the foundation has filed lawsuits against at least 28 soldiers in eight different countries. But that's not all – it appears the organization has submitted information to the International Criminal Court about 'war crimes' allegedly committed by more than a thousand soldiers and officers during their operations in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/01/07/complaint-filed-against-idf-soldier-in-argentina/	2025-01-07T03:33:41-08:00

Hostages have to get out now': Trump ups ante on Hamas	In a wide-ranging interview on Hugh Hewitt's podcast, former President Donald Trump reaffirmed his commitment to Israel while emphasizing his record of achievements in the Middle East, including the Abraham Accords and the relocation of the US Embassy to Jerusalem. div]:bg-bg-300 [&_.ignore-pre-bg>div]:bg-transparent [&_pre]:-mr-4 md:[&_pre]:-mr-9'> _*]:min-w-0'> 'I'm the best friend that Israel ever had,' Trump said during the conversation. He highlighted his administration's accomplishments, including the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and the construction of the US Embassy there. 'I not only said we're going to, I said you know we got it built to have a beautiful Embassy,' Trump said. The former president, speaking with Hugh Hewitt, emphasized his role in establishing the Abraham Accords, describing them as one of several 'major events' during his presidency that benefited Israel. 'Every single thing, every major event that's happened to Israel over the last fairly short period of time has been given through me,' Trump said. US President Joe Biden meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli war cabinet, as he visits Israel in Tel Aviv, October 18, 2023 (Reuters / /Evelyn Hockstein) Addressing current tensions in the region, Trump expressed his desire for peace while acknowledging the long-standing nature of the conflict. He also issued a stern warning regarding American hostages, stating there would be 'hell to pay' if they are not released by the time he potentially returns to office. When pressed by Hewitt about the specific meaning behind his warning, Trump elaborated with characteristic intensity: 'If those hostages aren't released by the time I get into office, there will be hell to pay. I don't think I have to go into it... it won't be the word don't, you know.

The interview touched on multiple aspects of Middle East policy, with Trump repeatedly emphasizing both his strong support for Israel and his commitment to achieving peace in the region, noting that the conflict has persisted 'longer than people would understand.' He also said, 'I have to add, I am also for peace, it's time, this fight has been going on for too long,' noting that he was going to try to end the war between Hamas and Israel that began on Oct. 7, 2023, when thousands of Hamas terrorists massacred some 1200 Israeli residents and took more than 230 captive.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/01/07/hostages-have-to-get-out-now-trump-ups-ante-on-hamas/	2025-01-06T21:30:16-08:00	
Hostages have to get out now': Trump ups ante on Hamas	In a wide-ranging interview on Hugh Hewitt's podcast, former President Donald Trump reaffirmed his commitment to Israel while emphasizing his record of achievements in the Middle East, including the Abraham Accords and the relocation of the US Embassy to Jerusalem. div]:bg-bg-300 [&_.ignore-pre-bg>div]:bg-transparent [&_pre]:-mr-4 md:[&_pre]:-mr-9'> _*]:min-w-0'> 'I'm the best friend that Israel ever had,' Trump said during the conversation. He highlighted his administration's accomplishments, including the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and the construction of the US Embassy there. 'I not only said we're going to, I said you know we got it built to have a beautiful Embassy,' Trump said. The former president, speaking with Hugh Hewitt, emphasized his role in establishing the Abraham Accords, describing them as one of several 'major events' during his presidency that benefited Israel. 'Every single thing that every major event that's happened to Israel over the last fairly short period of time has been given through me,' Trump said.

Gaza rockets strike Sderot home	Three rockets were launched from northern Gaza toward the southern Israeli border city of Sderot Monday morning. According to the IDF, one was successfully intercepted by the Iron Dome defense system, another struck within city limits, causing minor property damage to a residential building, and the third landed in an open area without causing significant damage. Masked terrorists from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad place homemade rockets before later firing them into Israel on the outskirts of Gaza City, Dec. 20, 2008 (AP/Ashraf Amra) AP/Ashraf Amra The attack triggered two sirens in Sderot at 11:11 and 11:12 a.m., prompting immediate emergency responses. Magen David Adom emergency response teams immediately mobilized, conducting thorough searches of the affected areas and confirming no casualties in the attack. Residents in southern Israel noted that significant explosions heard before the rocket fire were attributed to ongoing intensive IDF operations in northern Gaza.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/01/06/gaza-rockets-strike-sderot-home/	2025-01-05T23:00:12-08:00	
You have been warned': Hamas' explicit warnings hours before Oct...	Lieutenant Colonel (res.) Jonathan D. Halevi of the Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs (JCFA) revealed this morning (Sunday) a series of alarming posts that appeared on a Hamas-affiliated Telegram channel the night before the Oct. 7, 2023 massacre. His analysis suggests that different preparedness measures might have been possible had this intelligence been monitored and analyzed in real time. The infiltration of Gaza terrorists into Israel on Oct. 7 was preceded by explicit Telegram warnings, as documented in Arab network footage. The channel contained more than just overt threats against Israel – it served as a repository of detailed military instruction materials, encompassing combat methodology, concealment techniques, and explosives handling. The researcher's findings show that Hamas' intentions were telegraphed as early as September 2023, with explicit messages describing plans to target the communities along the Gaza border and execute a comprehensive attack. The investigation revealed that warning signals about Hamas' planned dawn attack on Oct. 7 were disseminated through the 'Military Tactics' Telegram channel, known to be affiliated with Hamas' military wing, the al-Qassam Brigades. The channel's administration and ownership were attributed to Hamam Rashid al-Masri, a terrorist who participated in the Oct. 7 attack and was later killed in November. A series of increasingly explicit hints and threats appeared on the Telegram channel between 00:20 and 00:26 on Oct. 7, 2023. The messages, accompanied by the researcher's contextual analysis in brackets, were as follows: 12:20 a.m.: '5,12 people of dawn are people of Allah.' [The numerical reference likely corresponds to morning prayer times – 05:20 in Gaza and 05:13 in Ramallah. In Islamic tradition, dawn prayer carries special significance, marking practitioners as devoted followers and guaranteeing divine blessing. The message appears to link this sacred time with the impending attack.] A Telegram message warned: 'The gunfire will reach you in your own backyard.' Photo credit: Arab media 12:22 a.m.: 'We say to the Zionist enemy, no one has experienced [the action] that will come to you.' 12:22 a.m.: 'There are many many many many many surprises.' 12:23 a.m.: 'We swear by Allah, we will humiliate you and destroy you completely, and the next phase will be difficult for you and all the cowardly settlers.' 12:22 a.m.: 'The pure rifles are loaded, and your heads are the target.' 12:25 a.m.: 'We will fight you in all [combat] arenas, and al-Qassam Brigades [Hamas] and al-Quds Brigades [Islamic Jihad] will roar with a thunder of gunfire and explosions in every [combat] arena, to the extent that media will be flooded with urgent reports about casualties and severe injuries in enemy forces' ranks.' 12:25 a.m.: 'Your attacks against [mosque] al-Aqsa in recent times will return to you in fire and flame.' 12:26 a.m.: 'You have been warned. What's coming will be massive.' [Accompanied by three emojis: a hand gesturing to wait, a flame of fire, and a green heart – Hamas and Islamic colors]. The researcher's investigation extended to September 2023, revealing additional warning signs posted three weeks before the Hamas attack on another Telegram channel connected to al-Masri, who identified himself as an 'al-Qassam Brigades writer.' A particularly telling message from September 2023 read: '[Message] to Gaza border settlers: before it's too late, run and leave, as we have made an unequivocal decision that has no mercy in it. We will turn your skulls into a bridge over which we will cross to Jerusalem and al-Aqsa [mosque]. You are deluding yourselves about your weak army and crumbling government. Nothing will help you except escape. Woe to you from our coming hours [our actions in the near future] which will bring you what no eye has seen and no ear has heard. The revolutionary youth, Gaza Strip. Monday, September 18.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/01/05/you-have-been-warned-hamas-explicit-warnings-hours-before-oct-7/	2025-01-05T04:50:01-08:00	
IDF soldier who survived Oct. 7 escapes Brazil as court seeks arr...	An Israeli soldier, who survived the October 7 Nova festival massacre and subsequently participated in military operations in Gaza, departed Brazil today (Sunday) after a federal court issued an investigation order against him on suspicion of genocide and crimes against humanity. The investigation stemmed from a complaint filed by a pro-Palestinian organization. The soldier had been vacationing in Brazil when the order was issued. IDF soldiers during Operation Iron Swords in Gaza (Photo: IDF Spokesperson's Unit) In a related development in Israel, the Ima Era (Awake Mother) organization, representing mothers of combat soldiers, delivered a strongly worded letter today to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi regarding the Brazilian authorities' investigation. The mothers expressed serious concern that unclear governmental policies and inflammatory statements by cabinet ministers are exposing soldiers to international legal jeopardy. 'The IDF has been conducting operations for 15 months without clear objectives or strategy due to the government's failure to establish definitive policies,' the letter emphasizes. 'This has resulted in a prolonged, exhausting campaign that not only drains our soldiers but also creates space for extreme viewpoints to penetrate both the IDF internally and the global perception externally.' The mothers highlight the government's inadequate response to repeated warnings about soldiers' vulnerability to international legal action. 'Israel's government has chosen willful ignorance, allowing the chaos instigated by its most radical ministers to expand unchecked,' their letter states. At a recent emergency gathering of reserve commanders two weeks ago, participants cautioned that IDF personnel and defense officials would face increased risk of overseas arrest should the Israeli judicial system's independence be compromised. Former Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit, who previously served as chief military advocate general, echoed these concerns during the conference. בברזיל פתחו בחקירה נגד תייר ישראלי שביקר במדינה ושירת בצה'ל במהלך המלחמה. הוא נאשם ב'פשעי מלחמה'- ולגודל האבסורד מדובר בבחור שניצל מהטבח במסיבת הנובה, אבל אותו מאשימים בפשעי מלחמה!!! לא מפתיע אותי כשמדובר במדינה כמו ברזיל שהנשיא האנטישמי שלה לולה האשים את ישראל ברצח עם, טען… pic.twitter.com/nytExnNCCm — יוסף חדאד - Yoseph Haddad (@YosephHaddad) January 5, 2025 Public diplomacy representative Yoseph Haddad addressed the situation on his X platform account, characterizing Brazil's actions as antisemitic.

Government failed to respond to Hamas sexual violence, report fin...	A comprehensive report by the Israel Women's Network and the Women and War Documentation and Research Collective reveals critical failures in Israel's response to sexual violence during and after the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre. The report highlights systematic governmental failures, including unimplemented UN resolutions and ignored civil society warnings about protecting women and children in conflict zones. 'We're more than a year into the event, and no one can guarantee that if this happens again, the state will handle it differently,' says Tal Hochman, executive director of the Israel Women's Network. The report, which will be submitted to multiple government offices, including the Prime Minister's Office and ministries of defense, foreign affairs, and justice, points to a 'lack of knowledge and professional capability within governmental mechanisms.' Video: Israeli interrogation of Gaza father and son confessing to rape and murder of civilians on Oct. 7 National security researcher Shira Shaham emphasizes that sexual violence in conflicts represents a fundamental security issue, not merely a women's rights concern. 'A security concept that doesn't consider aspects of dangers to women is an incomplete security concept,' she states. The report criticizes the absence of an official, transparent government account of war crimes and sexual violence during the attack. It particularly emphasizes the ongoing plight of hostages who 'continue to be exposed to violence in general and gender and sexual violence in particular' in Hamas captivity. In April, National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi directed the establishment of a 'national team on gender violence following Oct. 7' to integrate the issue with a broad perspective. The team brings together representatives from various government ministries and security branches, and focuses on action in diplomatic and international dimensions, working with UN bodies and human rights organizations. The State Attorney's Office stated, 'A thorough investigation of all Oct. 7 events has been and continues to be conducted, examining the role of each and every one of those investigated. Beyond this, at this stage we cannot detail the particulars and findings of the investigations.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/01/05/government-failed-to-respond-to-hamas-sexual-violence-report-finds/	2025-01-04T22:21:00-08:00	
Hamas' remaining rocket capability: A strategic assessment	Fifteen months into the war, Hamas demonstrates its continued capability to threaten Israeli territory, maintaining an almost daily pattern of rocket launches over the past ten days despite significant degradation of its infrastructure. In the latest incident Saturday afternoon, Israeli radar systems detected a rocket launch from northern Gaza that landed in the Erez region. This followed Friday's dual launches – one impacting near Kibbutz Nir Am and another in an unpopulated area. A separate significant development occurred Friday when Hamas attempted to target an IDF helicopter with a man-portable air-defense system. While the helicopter emerged unscathed, the projectile – assessed to be headed toward the Be'eri region – was intercepted by Israel's Iron Beam defense system. The Iron Dome in action (Defense Ministry) Defense Ministry Security analysts attribute Hamas' persistent launch capability to several strategic factors. Israeli defense assessments indicate the organization retains a limited stockpile ranging from dozens to several hundred rockets. With smuggling routes restricted primarily to the Philadelphi Corridor and Rafah crossing, each launch effectively depletes the terror group's diminishing arsenal. Defense officials have consistently maintained that completely eliminating Hamas' rocket capability was an unrealistic objective, though the current operational tempo represents a fraction of their previous capacity. The timing and intensity of recent launches potentially reflect multiple strategic considerations. Intelligence assessments suggest Hamas may be accelerating deployments to prevent stockpile seizure by advancing IDF forces. Additionally, the increased activity could represent psychological pressure tactics ahead of potential hostage negotiations, exemplified by the organization's recent release of footage showing captured IDF lookout Liri Albag. A more concerning analysis suggests the possibility of operational recovery in areas where IDF presence has diminished. Despite severe disruption to Hamas' command and control infrastructure, the absence of alternative governance structures may be enabling the terror organization to reconstitute certain capabilities.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/01/05/hamas-remaining-rocket-capability-a-strategic-assessment/	2025-01-04T18:30:27-08:00	
It drives the antisemites crazy': French vigilante erases pro-Ha...	Claudine (pseudonym), a content creator from France, has discovered a powerful and innovative approach to expressing her views in public spaces: under cover of darkness, she transforms pro-Hamas and pro-Palestinian graffiti into messages supporting hostage return and French values of liberty. 'I'm fighting for our freedom,' she declares, 'public spaces belong to everyone, not to extremists.' Growing up in the southern suburbs of Paris, Claudine was immersed in a multicultural environment where Jews, Muslims, Christians, and secular individuals coexisted against a predominantly leftist political backdrop. Born to a Jewish father who escaped Tunisia in 1960 and a non-Jewish French mother, she was raised with strong principles of liberty and equality, though she identifies as a 'secular French Jew.' @tous_resistants #freefrance ♬ Paris my passion - Music For Business In the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack, she made a pivotal decision to revisit her graffiti roots with a new mission. 'I began with massive graffiti declaring 'HAMAS RAPE' and 'FUCK HAMAS,'' she reveals. Since then, her nighttime missions involve locating anti-Israel graffiti such as 'Free Gaza' and 'Death to Israel,' which she transforms into messages advocating for hostage return, accompanied by French flags. Her activism has created ripples within the French hip-hop community where she belongs, which she estimates is 90% pro-Palestinian. 'They despise me for utilizing tools they considered their exclusive domain,' she notes, 'but that doesn't faze me. I avoid confrontation, violence, or arguments – I simply take action.' @tous_resistants Chacun peut agir.

Yet gradually, both Jewish and non-Jewish supporters reached out with gratitude and offers to join her cause. 'I'm not leading a group, but sparking a movement,' she emphasizes. Now, she receives documentation of similar actions from throughout France and neighboring countries including Germany, Luxembourg, and England. Roughly two months ago, she expanded her presence to TikTok, despite facing platform restrictions.

Turkish officials: Assad's fall wasn't the original plan	Turkish officials have disclosed to the US administration that neither they nor Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) had originally planned or anticipated the overthrow of Bashar Assad and Syria's capture, instead seizing an unexpected opportunity for success – information that US officials subsequently shared with Israel. The Turkish explanation indicated their original strategy aimed only to modestly expand Mohammad al-Julani's organization's control around Aleppo in northern Syria, near the Turkish border. The unexpectedly rapid collapse of Aleppo and the disintegration of Syrian military forces prompted al-Julani and his supporters to push forward into additional regions of the country. Simultaneously, contradictory reports emerge from Syria regarding the new leadership's approach toward minority communities.

Despite these assurances, the Kurdish leadership in northern Syria continues to report harassment from the new leadership. Israel Hayom has obtained information about an extensive phone discussion between Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar and Ilham Ahmad, Foreign Minister of the Kurdish autonomous region in northern Syria. During their conversation, the Kurdish representative reported arbitrary arrests and executions of Kurdish citizens by the new leadership.

NYT: UNRWA prepares to cease operations in Gaza, West Bank	The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) plans to fully suspend its operations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the New York Times reported today (Friday). The report indicates that the agency's decision comes in response to legislation passed by the Knesset in October. UN officials indicated they are preparing to terminate operations in both territories primarily because the new laws will prevent Israeli officials from engaging with UNRWA. The agency emphasizes that coordination with the Israel Defense Forces is essential whenever its personnel deliver aid or traverse areas throughout Gaza and sections of the West Bank. 'Without the ability to share this information with Israeli authorities on a daily basis our teams would face severe security risks,' Louise Wateridge, a senior UNRWA official in Gaza, said. She noted that the Gaza war has already claimed the lives of more than 250 UNRWA workers.

Message to Erdogan: US Builds new base in northern Syria	Rising tensions in northern Syria: Convoys transporting concrete fortifications intended for the establishment of a US base arrived today (Thursday) in the northern Syrian town of Kobani, a Kurdish militia stronghold located near the Turkish border. The convoy was documented by locals, and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the move marks an American effort to build a large base in the area. Kobani has become a symbol of Kurdish resistance against the terrorist organization ISIS. Yesterday, a large US military convoy entered the town as part of what was described as a combat patrol in the area.

Controversial 'Generals' Plan' in northern Gaza picks up steam	Eight members of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee have recently signed a letter demanding that Defense Minister Israel Katz immediately replace the operational plan in Gaza. A situation report presented to committee members recently reveals that Hamas is swiftly rebuilding in every area from which the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has withdrawn, including rearming in Khan Yunis and Nuseirat. Likud Member of Knesset (MK) Amit Halevi initiated the letter, which was signed by MKs from all coalition factions. It contains harsh criticism of the war's conduct thus far and demands that Katz himself replace the current operational plan, which Halevi describes as 'stagnation,' with a strategy focused on 'victory and decisive action.' Members of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, who closely monitor IDF operations since the start of the ground offensive, argue that the ground operation that began on October 27, 2023, and its subsequent execution, 'fails to achieve the war's objectives as defined by the political echelon – dismantling Hamas's governmental and military capabilities.' They note that these goals remain unrealized, despite the operation taking place in a relatively small area against an enemy lacking the tools and capabilities of a modern army. The signatories contend that the IDF's current approach, relying on focused raids, allows Hamas to repeatedly rebuild its capabilities. This strategy, they argue, has resulted in a war of attrition that does not bring about a decisive outcome. Gaza as seen from the US Air Force overflying the Gaza Strip, Thursday, March 14, 2024 (AP / Leo Correa) AP / Leo Correa Alongside Halevi, MKs Zvi Sukkot, Ariel Kellner, Ohad Tal, Nissim Vaturi, Osher Shkalim, and others have endorsed the letter. Essentially, they are advocating for the implementation of the 'Generals' Plan,' which involves evacuating the population from northern Gaza and imposing a siege. They believe this approach will lead to effective control over the territory and population, allowing for 'cleansing the enemy from Gaza and striving for a decisive victory rather than stagnation and a war of attrition in which Israel bears the brunt of exhaustion.' The letter further reveals a stark claim from the committee members: soldiers in Gaza are dying in vain. 'We repeatedly send our soldiers into neighborhoods and alleys they've conquered multiple times before. These are areas IDF leaders have declared cleared of Hamas battalions and enemy presence. Yet in these same places, we continue to pay a terrible and unbearable price in blood.' Katz, who due to the war's intensity has not received the customary 100 days of grace in his new role, is now tasked with reevaluating the operational plan alongside the Prime Minister. They are expected to lead the implementation of the 'Generals' Plan' to defeat Hamas wherever the IDF needs to engage. The proposed strategy involves several steps: First, encircling and evacuating the population. This would be followed by the remote destruction of all energy sources, including fuel and solar facilities, and the elimination of food sources such as warehouses and water reservoirs. The plan also calls for the remote elimination of anyone moving in the area who does not surrender with a white flag during the siege. Only after these actions and a period of siege on those who remain should the IDF gradually enter for a complete clearing of enemy strongholds. This approach, the signatories argue, would minimize unnecessary risks to IDF soldiers' lives. It's worth noting that the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee and its subcommittees serve as the primary oversight body for the military and defense establishment in executing war plans and achieving objectives. They receive weekly intelligence briefings detailing the progress of forces and achievements on the ground. In some instances, especially members of the subcommittees receive more substantiated and accurate information than cabinet members who convene for ad-hoc decision discussions. A woman stands with two children under a fraying shade along a street in the western part of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip on June 14, 2024 (Bashar Taleb / AFP) Bashar Taleb / AFP Katz, who has not shied away from confrontation with the IDF chief of staff, now faces perhaps his most significant challenge in shaping Gaza operational decisions – a domain previously led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Katz's predecessor. The prolonged nature of the Gaza war, now exceeding a year without achieving its stated objectives, has become a source of deep concern for many Israelis. This includes parents of soldiers, families of hostages, and residents of communities bordering Gaza. Committee members, who field repeated inquiries on this matter and compare them against IDF responses, fear that the current approach will fail to achieve the war's objectives, both in the near term and long-term. 'To date, IDF representatives in the committee have failed to provide satisfactory explanations for why they are not taking the necessary actions to decisively defeat the enemy, nor have they outlined clear plans for the future,' the letter concludes. 'We therefore request your immediate intervention to address these questions and provide appropriate directives to the IDF. The goal must be to achieve a decisive victory and halt the unjustified risk to our soldiers' lives.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/01/02/knesset-committee-pushes-for-controversial-generals-plan-in-gaza/	2025-01-01T21:00:24-08:00

Report: US sends $22B in military aid to Israel since Oct. 7	Since the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre, the United States has dramatically intensified its military support for Israel, committing more than $22 billion to bolster military operations across Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, American weapons supply to Israel increased from 69% in 2019-2023 to 78% currently. By December 2023, Israel received military equipment worth $2.4 billion, with the value growing to $12 billion by August 2024. As Israel's most significant ally, the United States provides advanced military equipment including Iron Dome defense system missiles, precision-guided bombs, CH-53 heavy transport helicopters, AH-64 Apache combat helicopters, and armored vehicles. Israeli soldier in the Gaza Strip (IDF Spokesperson's Unit) IDF Spokesperson's Unit The Council on Foreign Relations reports that since 1946, the United States has provided Israel with military and economic aid totaling more than $310 billion (adjusted for inflation). A $38 billion military aid agreement, signed in 2016 for ten years, remains active and allocates $3.8 billion annually for military funding and missile defense. In 2024, additional emergency packages were approved, including $14.1 billion in February and weapons shipments worth $2.5 billion in March. To date, the United States has approved more than 100 arms deals with Israel, despite growing criticism over weapons use in populated areas and limited Congressional oversight.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/01/01/report-us-sends-22b-in-military-aid-to-israel-since-oct-7/	2024-12-31T22:30:21-08:00	
Significant financial damage by Houthis on US Military	The Houthis' military spokesperson, Yahya Saree, announced this morning (Wednesday) that the group successfully downed another American drone in the skies over the Marib province, Yamen, east of the capital Sanaa. According to Saree, the drone 'engaged in hostile activities within the province's airspace and was brought down using a domestically-produced surface-to-air missile.' Saree noted that this is the second drone to be downed in the last three days. In recent years, the cost of a single MQ-9 drone has reached $32 million. The cumulative cost of 14 drones totals $448 million. In other words, if the Houthis indeed downed 14 drones of this model—not cheaper drones—the damage they have caused amounts to nearly half a billion dollars. The cost of a single unit is $32 million.

Yesterday, a weapons depot and the Defense Ministry's headquarters were attacked. However, a senior Houthi official claimed these sites are not typically occupied by the militia and declared that the strikes will not deter their attacks against Israel, which are intended to end the war in Gaza.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/01/01/significant-financial-damage-by-houthis-on-us-military/	2024-12-31T22:13:04-08:00	
IDF reportedly eliminates Hamas police chief	The IDF has eliminated two senior Hamas police commanders in a precision strike, according to Palestinian sources. The operation resulted in the death of Hamas police chief Mahmoud Salah and Khan Younis district commander Hossam Shahwan, marking another significant setback for the organization's leadership structure in Gaza.

Security forces responded swiftly, neutralizing the attacker at the scene. In southern Israel, Eilat's warning system was activated following detection of potential hostile aircraft, though this alert was later verified as a false alarm.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/01/01/report-idf-eliminates-hamas-police-chief-khan-younis-commander/	2024-12-31T21:26:46-08:00	
Minions TikToks more 'Despicable' than you think	In recent days, an alarming trend has emerged on TikTok, where seemingly innocent videos featuring the beloved Minion characters are being uploaded to the platform – concealing violent and deeply disturbing content beneath their cheerful exterior. The 'Jumpers Jump Podcast' TikTok account brought attention to this phenomenon, revealing that content containing violence, abuse, and assault is being masked behind the familiar yellow Minion characters from the movie 'Despicable Me.' The podcast explained that content creators are utilizing sophisticated artificial intelligence technology to disguise disturbing dark web videos containing violent and abusive content, transforming them into what appear to be harmless Minion animations. The alleged purpose, according to the podcast, is to deliberately expose children to this harmful material. The beloved Minions in a scene from 'Despicable Me 4'. Photo credit: Illumination & Universal Pictures via AP AP This disturbing manipulation is made possible through AI technology developed by artificial intelligence company Runway, which created an innovative tool that can transform any video character into a Minion, including voice conversion capabilities. While the technology was intended for entertainment and creative purposes, certain individuals have allegedly exploited it to process disturbing dark web content. 'When you notice your nieces and nephews or cousins watching these types of videos, exercise caution and take steps to protect them – this is malicious content that infiltrates their subconscious. Individuals are transforming dark web content into children's entertainment; this material is completely inappropriate for them,' one of the podcast hosts warned. It's crucial to note that these allegations remain unverified at present, and there is uncertainty whether this represents a genuine threat or a conspiracy theory. Regardless, the situation raises serious concerns, as TikTok's algorithm currently lacks the sophistication to differentiate between legitimate children's animation and content containing extreme violence and abuse.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/31/minions-tiktok-videos-might-be-more-despicble-than-you-think/	2024-12-30T20:00:32-08:00	
How Israel kept the hostages in its heart through 2024	2024 was undoubtedly marked by the resounding call to 'Bring them home.' These 365 days, perhaps the longest in the nation's history, saw Israeli citizens adamantly refuse to leave the hostages behind. Media outlets, family members, and countless citizens joined forces to keep public attention focused on the hostages' plight. In a year of unprecedented turmoil, many continued their daily struggle for the freedom of their brothers and sisters held captive in Gaza by enemy forces. As the new year approaches, Israelis must reflect on twelve months of diverse initiatives: from public demonstrations to powerful speeches and compelling exhibits – each effort, though yet to achieve its ultimate goal, strengthening the collective resolve. One hundred men, women, and children remain in captivity, possibly unaware that another year has passed.

From Olympic venues to cultural festivals, even appearing on holiday treats in bakery windows, these yellow markers became deeply embedded in the national consciousness. Nearly every public event throughout the year included at least a mention of those still waiting to come back home in Gaza. Town squares across Israel transformed into visual testimonials, gradually filling with portraits of the hostages and calls for their return. The imagery became so pervasive that it reshaped the character of many cities, with local residents turning their public spaces into monuments of solidarity with the hostages' families.

These vacant seats, often paired with hostage photographs, appeared in locations nationwide – from city squares to urban centers to ordinary streets – each chair standing empty, waiting for them to come home. Public demonstrations, though sometimes controversial, maintained consistent pressure throughout the year. Weekly gatherings at Hostages Square and other locations kept the issue at the forefront of national dialogue.

They organized massive marches in Tel Aviv, blocked roads, lit bonfires, spray-painted protest slogans, and set up stages where people spoke about bringing the hostages home. These rallies drew support from government ministers, artists, and other public figures. Israelis demonstrating for the release of the hostages held in Gaza on Sept. 1, 2024.

Citizens created human displays, and sculptures, and reimagined everyday objects as symbols of protest. Notable projects included yellow shirt displays, a 98-foot replica of a Hamas tunnel, coordinated vehicle processions, and torch installations commemorating the casualties of the Iron Swords War.

Syrian Jews visit historic synagogue after Assad fall	Following the fall of the Assad regime, the handful of Jews remaining in Syria can once again visit one of the world's oldest synagogues in Damascus's Jobar suburb, which previously attracted worshippers from throughout the region. The suburb, which was a dangerous zone during Syria's 13-year civil war and served as a battleground between regime forces and rebels, is now safe to visit again. The civil war left the area and the synagogue, known as Eliyahu Hanavi, in ruins. Walls and roofs have collapsed, and artifacts are missing. A marble sign at the entrance states in Arabic that it was built 720 years before Christ. Syria was once home to one of the largest Jewish communities in the world. According to the Associated Press, after Jerusalem fell to Crusader forces in 1099, about 50,000 Jewish refugees fled to Damascus, making up nearly a third of its population. The community grew further with Jews escaping the Spanish Inquisition after 1492. The numbers diminished significantly after Israel's establishment in 1948, and today only nine Jews remain. According to community leaders, almost all are elderly, and they believe no Jews will remain in the country within a few years. 'This synagogue means a lot to us,' Bakhour Chamntoub, the 74-year-old head of Syria's Jewish community, told AP during his first visit in 15 years. Upon seeing parts reduced to rubble, he added, 'I am frankly disturbed.' Jews worldwide have contacted him offering to help rebuild. Bakhour Chamntoub near the Eliyahu Hanavi synagogue (AP) Chamntoub refused to leave Syria during the civil war, while his 12 siblings departed. He told AP he is happy in Syria and surrounded by people who respect him. As one of the few Jews who openly speaks about his faith, he says he never encountered discrimination. Other community members prefer not to speak publicly for security reasons and fears of being labeled as spies or collaborators with Israel. The Syrian Jewish community numbered about 100,000 at the start of the 20th century. During the Assad family's 54-year rule, Jews enjoyed religious freedom but were prevented from traveling outside the country until the early 1990s to prevent emigration to Israel. After restrictions were lifted with the beginning of Arab-Israeli peace talks, many more left. Before Syria's 2011 conflict, Chamntoub and remaining community members would come to Jobar for Shabbat prayers. He recalled the Torah scrolls written on gazelle leather, chandeliers, and carpets that disappeared, likely stolen by looters. Barakat Hazroumi, a Muslim born and raised near the synagogue, described to AP how worshippers would ask him to turn on lights or light candles on Shabbat. 'It was a beautiful religious place,' he noted, adding that the entire destroyed suburb 'needs to be reconstructed from scratch.' Assad's forces recaptured Jobar from rebels in 2018 but imposed heavy security that prevented many from accessing the area. The new leadership under Hayat Tahrir al-Sham claims they will allow religious freedom for all faiths, despite some sectarian attacks primarily targeting the Alawite minority. Today, Chamntoub lives in old Damascus's Jewish quarter, near the shuttered Maimonides Jewish school. He maintains his religious practices despite challenges, receiving annual kosher meat packages from his American siblings. He prepares meals for fellow community member Firdos Mallakh, 88, who has no remaining relatives in Syria. As he observes the eight-day Hanukkah holiday alone at home, Chamntoub hopes that with the regime's fall, Syrians will enjoy more freedoms, economic and otherwise. Previously, he told AP, authorities prevented him from giving interviews without security clearance. 'I am a Jew and I am proud of it,' he declared.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/30/handful-of-syria-jews-visit-main-synagogue-amid-post-assad-hopes/	2024-12-29T22:15:24-08:00
