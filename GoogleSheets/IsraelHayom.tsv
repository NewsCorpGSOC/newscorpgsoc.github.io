Report: Quds Force commander suffers heart attack during interrog...	The Arabic branch of Sky News reported today (Thursday) that Ismail Ghaani, the commander of the Quds Force of the Revolutionary Guards, is suspected of having communicated with Israel. According to the report, Ghaani was interrogated regarding an intelligence breach and suffered a heart attack during the investigation, after which he was taken to a hospital. Sky News also reported that Ghaani's chief of staff is under suspicion of communicating with Israel. There is no confirmation of the report from any other source.

Photo: Getty Images In recent days, it was reported that Ghaani was supposed to receive an honorary award from Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, following statements from Revolutionary Guards spokesperson asserting that he was in good health. It was previously claimed that Ghaani had been in Beirut two days before the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah in late September. According to reports last week, Ghaani had not been in contact with the Iranian regime for several days following the attack in Dahiya that targeted senior Hezbollah official Hisham Safi al-Din, who had been designated to succeed Nasrallah. The New York Times reported that Ghaani had visited Hezbollah's headquarters in Beirut prior to the attack. Earlier this week, Ghaani's deputy, Ariaj Masjedi, addressed the reports, stating that the commander is in good condition and carrying out his duties. 'Many are asking where Ghaani is. He is healthy and active,' Masjedi said this past Sunday.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/10/report-quds-force-commander-suffers-heart-attack-during-interrogation-over-ties-with-israel/	2024-10-10T05:13:53-07:00	
Civilians beat us': Israeli teen reveals ordeal of Hamas captivi...	In a poignant interview for the 'Children of October 7' social media project, 13-year-old Eitan Yahalomi from Nir Oz, shared the harrowing details of his captivity in Gaza. The young survivor, who was released in November as part of a hostage release deal, recounted instances of physical abuse, persistent hunger, and being forced to watch disturbing footage. Yahalomi was kidnapped from his home during the Oct. 7 attack. His father, who was shot during the abduction, remains in captivity, while his mother and sister managed to escape an attempted kidnapping. Question 46: Do you think after watching this video of 13 year old child hostage Eitan Yahalomi you would question your worldview and conclude that the Palestinian people are fundamentally Hamas? pic.twitter.com/4YHIQuY12T — Just Asking Questions (@BrokenCurator) October 10, 2024 'When we arrived in Gaza, I saw many people beating us. We heard gunshots and Arabic shouting. They were waiting for us. They were civilians,' Eitan said, describing his initial entry into Gaza. When asked if he had felt scared, he responded candidly, 'A bit, to be honest.' Throughout his captivity, Eitan faced constant hunger. 'My daily ration was a pita and a cucumber,' he revealed. He also spoke of being subjected to disturbing content. 'They showed me videos of them killing people. They seemed happy about it.' The Yahalomi family: father Ohad, mother Batsheva, son Eitan and daughter When asked about whether he tried to avoid watching, Eitan explained, 'No, it wouldn't have mattered anyway, he wouldn't have allowed it. I saw even worse things. These images are constantly in my mind.' As for his ability to sleep at night, Eitan added with stark honesty, 'Not much. I've been through the worst, and that's that.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/10/civilians-beat-us-israeli-teen-reveals-ordeal-of-hamas-captivity/	2024-10-09T22:00:44-07:00	
Gaza hostage marks 2nd birthday in captivity	Yarden Bibas has become the first of the Israeli hostages held in Gaza to mark a second birthday in captivity. The gravity of this statement takes a moment to sink in. Yarden, the father of the widely known Ariel and Kfir Bibas, the young ginger children who were also kidnapped to Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023, is turning 35 while being held against his will for the second year running. 'It's unfathomable that a year has gone by and they're still being held captive,' Ofri, Yareden's sister said. 'I keep wondering when I'll reach my breaking point. When it will become unbearable. My son Afik is four months old. Kfir, Yarden's son, was taken when he was just nine months old. I can't help but dread the possibility that they might still be hostages by the time Afik reaches Kfir's age.' Footage of Yarden Bibas' kidnapping on Oct. 7, 2023. Photo credit: Social media On Oct. 7, 2023, Yarden was taken from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz. His wife Shiri and their children Ariel, then 4, and Kfir, a nine-month-old infant at the time were forcibly abducted in a separate incident. Hamas released video footage that captured the terror in Shiri's eyes during their abduction, an image that has haunted Israel and communities abroad alike. 'Yarden's last birthday marked the first time we received proof he was alive,' Ofri recalled. 'After seeing the images of Shiri in Gaza released shortly after the kidnapping, I was convinced Yarden had been killed. But when we were told he wasn't in the house and there were no signs of bloodshed, he was classified as missing. Three days later, on the morning of his birthday, someone contacted us saying they believed they had identified him in and sent us the image. It was indeed him. Since then, we've been in a constant state of anguish.' When asked what she would wish for her brother, she said: 'Dodgy,' using his family nickname, 'I wish for you to return to life, to come back to us alive. To smile again, to laugh, to feel the warmth of sunlight, and breathe fresh air. I wish you freedom. And above all – I wish for you to kiss Shiri again and embrace Ariel and Kfir.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/10/gaza-hostage-marks-2nd-birthday-in-captivity/	2024-10-09T22:00:36-07:00	
Turkey bans Discord for not sharing user information	Turkey has blocked access to the instant messaging platform Discord following a court decision, as the platform refused to share user information requested by Ankara, Turkish officials announced on Wednesday, according to Reuters. Transport and Infrastructure Minister Abdulkadir Uraloglu highlighted the challenges faced by authorities in monitoring and intervening when illegal or criminal content is shared on Discord. 'Security personnel cannot go through the content. We can only intervene when users complain to us about content shared there,' he told reporters in parliament. Uraloglu added, 'Since Discord refuses to share its own information, including IP addresses and content, with our security units, we were forced to block access.' Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan addresses members of parliament from his ruling AK Party (AKP) during a meeting at the Turkish parliament in Ankara, Turkey, October 9, 2024 (Photo: Reuters/Cagla Gurdogan) REUTERS The block comes in the wake of public outrage in Turkey over the murder of two women by a 19-year-old man in Istanbul earlier this month. Social media content revealed that some Discord users subsequently praised the killings, prompting authorities to take action. Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc explained that an Ankara court decided to block access to Discord from Turkey due to 'sufficient suspicion that crimes of child sexual abuse and obscenity' had been committed by some users on the platform. Turkey has banned Discord. And hey I don't love Discord, but that's because too many people use is as a coordination tool when it was designed for gaming communities. It absolutely should not be banned by any government. This is why decentralization actually matters. — abigail carlson (@abigailcarlson_) October 9, 2024 This development follows a similar move by Russia's communications regulator, which blocked Discord on Tuesday for violating Russian law. The platform had previously been fined for failing to remove banned content, according to the TASS news agency.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/10/turkey-blocks-discord-for-not-sharing-user-information/	2024-10-09T18:30:14-07:00	
Pro-Israel journalist attacked in Barcelona	A disturbing attack on an Israel supporter unfolded in Spain as far-left activists hurled red paint at journalist and author Pilar Rahola during her lecture marking the start of the academic year. The incident occurred while Rahola was speaking at Marti i Loma University in La Garriga, a Barcelona suburb. 'You're stained with blood - this is what happens to supporters of genocide in Palestine,' the assailants shouted before fleeing the hall. Before the event, they had protested outside, waving Palestinian flags and a large banner reading: 'We'll destroy the Zionist state of Israel' and 'Zionism is fascism.' Video: Footage of a far-left group's attack on journalist Pilar Rahola. Credit: Social media Rahola, a former Catalan politician, stood her ground, pausing her lecture only to wipe off the red paint and change her shirt. She responded defiantly, saying, 'They won't silence me. I won't hide, and I won't fear them. I'm a free citizen in a free country - and fascists, whether right-wing or left-wing, will never stop me from exercising my freedom. This is what you, the attackers, are afraid of.' she added. 'You're afraid of freedom.' Barcelona's Jewish community swiftly condemned the attack. 'Some seek lies and hatred, while others seek truth and blessing,' their statement read. 'Some invest in terror and destruction, while others invest in building, life, and progress. Amidst the darkness, there's much light, and today we face a clear choice: to be light or darkness. Clearly, there's no place in universities for those who destroy and attack. Thank you, Pilar.' No me callarán. No me esconderé. No les tendré miedo. Soy una ciudadana libre en un país libre. Nunca el fascismo, ni de derechas, ni de izquierdas impedirá que ejerza mi libertad. De eso tenéis miedo, vosotros, los agresores. Tenéis miedo de la libertad. — Pilar Rahola (@RaholaOficial) October 8, 2024 The assault on Rahola reflects the hostile, anti-Israel climate in Spain, partly fueled by the government. On Oct. 7, several leading Spanish newspapers published articles criticizing the Israeli government, some in harsh terms. While Madrid's Foreign Ministry issued a statement honoring those killed in the Hamas massacre, many far-left politicians used the occasion to criticize Israel. For instance, a Podemos member of the European Parliament protested in the European Parliament against its support for 'terrorist Israel committing genocide.' On Oct. 8, she posted, 'A year ago, a new phase in the Palestinian genocide by the terrorist state of Israel began.' Recently, Yolanda Diaz, Spain's former Deputy Prime Minister from the far-left Sumar party, shared an anti-Israel video, concluding with the infamous saying, 'From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.' The atmosphere in Barcelona around the Oct. 7 massacre anniversary was equally tense. 'The anniversary again triggered an anti-Israel and antisemitic wave in Barcelona,' says Shai Deutsch, Community Development Manager at Israeli Community Europe (ICE). 'On October 6, pro-Hamas rallies were held in the city, which was plastered with anti-Israel and anti-Jewish graffiti and posters. As they've done all year, the Israeli community acted swiftly, covering the city overnight with posters about the hostages and information about the massacre's anniversary. We also organized a major memorial event to ensure Barcelona remembers the events of October 7 and the past year.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/09/pro-israel-journalist-attacked-in-barcelona/	2024-10-08T20:00:46-07:00	
Can you call a bus 'Israel' in India? Driver defends unusual gest...	A bus owner in Mangaluru in the state of Karnataka, India has found himself at the center of an unexpected controversy, as reported by the Times of India. Lester Kateel, who has been working in Israel for the past 12 years, recently named his bus 'Israel Travels,' only to face backlash on social media platforms. The bus, which operates on the Moodbidri-Kinnigoli-Kateel-Mulki route, became the subject of heated online attacks by Muslim antagonists as tensions between Israel and its terrorist enemies escalated. According to the Times of India, a section of social media users began sharing pictures of the vehicle, calling for police action against the owner for using the name 'Israel.' The bus that has come under attack (Photo: Courtesy) In response to the growing controversy, Kateel made the decision to rename his bus 'Jerusalem.' He told the Sunday Times of India, 'Soon after noticing these messages on social media, I decided to change the name.' The bus owner expressed confusion over the backlash, stating, 'I have no idea why people have issues with 'Israel Travels'.' Kateel mentioned that the police had not pressured him to alter the name of his vehicle. Those advocating for the name change argued that if police can register an FIR (First Information Report) for updating a WhatsApp status in support of 'Palestine,' similar action should be taken against the bus owner for naming his vehicle after Israel. The police has dismissed the claims of any wrongdoing on his behalf.In this region of southwest India, there is a large Catholic Christian minority, and for them, the connection to the Holy Land is almost self-evident. Speaking with Israel Hayom Kateel said, 'I love Israel so much. It's because I've worked here for so many years, and I love how this country works and operates. I feel very protected here even during wartime.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/08/can-you-call-a-bus-israel-in-india-pro-israel-driver-fights-on/	2024-10-08T01:41:32-07:00	
Israel unlikely to strike Iran's nuclear sites without US backing...	Israel has spent 22 years planning for a potential strike on Iran's nuclear facilities, but experts suggest such an attack is unlikely in the current climate and could prove ineffective without American support, according to reporting from The New York Times. The Israeli Air Force recently conducted drills over the Mediterranean Sea, simulating 'long-range flight, aerial refueling and striking distant targets,' as described by the Israel Defense Forces. These exercises serve to intimidate Iran and signal to the Biden administration that Israel is prepared to act unilaterally if necessary. However, President Biden has warned Israel against striking nuclear or energy sites, emphasizing that any response to Iran's recent missile attacks should be 'proportionate.' Defense Secretary Lloyd J Austin III has urged his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, to avoid actions that could lead to further escalation. Members of the media and officials tour the water nuclear reactor at Arak, Iran December 23, 2019 (Reuters / West Asia News Agency) Reuters / West Asia News Agency Despite these cautions, some Israeli officials advocate for immediate action. Naftali Bennett, a former prime minister, argued on social media: 'Israel has now its greatest opportunity in 50 years, to change the face of the Middle East. We must act now to destroy Iran's nuclear program, its central energy facilities, and to fatally cripple this terrorist regime.' He added, 'We have the justification. We have the tools. Now that Hezbollah and Hamas are paralyzed, Iran stands exposed.' The debate has become a political issue in the United States as well. Former President Donald J Trump suggested that Israel should 'hit the nuclear first and worry about the rest later.' Representative Michael R Turner criticized President Biden on CBS's Face the Nation, saying: 'It's completely irresponsible for the president to say that it is off the table, when he's previously said it's on the table.' Experts question the effectiveness of an Israeli strike, concerned it might drive Iran's nuclear program deeper underground. Iran has consistently denied intentions to develop nuclear weapons, citing a 2003 fatwa by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Israel's capability to carry out such an attack is limited by its aging fleet of Boeing 707 aerial refueling planes. General Frank McKenzie, former head of US Central Command, noted: 'The nuclear target is a very difficult target. There are a lot of other alternatives to that target,' adding that many of them, including energy infrastructure, would be easier to execute. Ehud Barak, who served as Israel's highest-ranked uniformed officer and prime minister, said in a 2019 interview with The New York Times that President George W Bush's warning against striking Iran 'did not really make any difference for us.' As of the end of 2008, he said, Israel did not have a feasible plan for attacking Iran. The situation is further complicated by reports of Russian technical assistance to Iran's nuclear program. Secretary of State Antony J Blinken has raised concerns about this, describing it as 'technical assistance' without evidence of Russia providing hardware for warhead development. American officials, starting with President Biden, have argued against such strikes. As The New York Times reports, they say these attacks 'would likely be ineffective and could plunge the region into a full-scale war.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/08/israel-unlikely-to-strike-irans-nuclear-sites-without-us-backing-experts-say/	2024-10-07T21:34:06-07:00	
I knew I might be the last witness': Oct. 7 survivors explain wh...	The Oct. 7 attack caught Israel off guard, with thousands in southern communities and at the Nova music festival suddenly running for their lives. Despite the shock, danger, and overwhelming sense of helplessness, many chose to document the chaos as they fled – sometimes capturing the final images of those who didn't survive. Video: Michal's footage of the Oct. 7 attack at the Nova Festival site. Credit: courtesy 'My close friends Osher and Michael Waknin, who are no longer with us, were part of the Nova festival production team this year and invited me to join,' Michal Ohana, 27 from Jerusalem, recounted. Ohana had spent the previous year working as a veterinary nurse in Portugal. 'I returned to Israel just days before Oct. 7 to visit family, celebrate the holidays, and because my older sister was about to give birth.' Nothing could have prepared Ohana for the terror she was about to experience. During the festival, she found herself documenting horrific scenes of people fleeing from attackers, injuries, gunfire, and life-threatening danger. 'At 6:29 a.m., the rocket barrage began, and I sensed something was terribly wrong. I had this gut feeling. So I started filming everything,' she recalled. 'I believe every moment from 6:29 a.m. until my evacuation in the late afternoon was crucial to document. I captured my own escape and videos that now serve as final memories for families of those murdered. I recorded the gunfire, the fear, and the sheer madness we all experienced. These videos convey the most horrific feelings imaginable, and it's all real. Thanks to my footage, people found vital information about missing persons, murder victims, and hostages. Most importantly, I documented the most brutal massacre in our history, ensuring it can never be denied.' Despite being wounded during an encounter with attackers, Ohana continued filming. 'My phone became my eyes. I gripped it tightly, fearing I'd drop it while running. When I came face-to-face with the terrorists, they fired an RPG at me. As I fled, I was shot in the leg. Even while bleeding, I kept filming because I knew that if I died, someone would find my phone and see what happened to us,' she recalled. 'The videos and photos I took are irrefutable proof of what Hamas did that day. They murdered, raped, looted, and mutilated bodies – some were my friends. These videos are shocking and difficult to watch, but they show the truth.' Video: Michal's footage of the Oct. 7 attack at the Nova Festival site. Credit: courtesy In hindsight, Ohana believes her decision to document everything was the right choice. 'I realize now that while I was in the situation, I was also viewing it from the outside through my camera – and that protected me from the horrific sights I witnessed. When I encountered the terrorists face-to-face, I knew I was likely to die. It was a terrifying realization, but I decided to keep filming as long as I was alive. I hoped that if someone found my phone, it might change something in the future. Now I know my footage is being shared worldwide, helping people understand what happened to us.' 'I knew I might be the last witness' Liron Avigzer, 27, from Netanya, manages bars and helps set up event booths. On Oct. 7, she was at the Nova festival site, where she had set up a jewelry booth with her friend Shay. When gunshots suddenly rang out, Avigzer realized the gravity of the situation and decided to document what was happening from her hiding spot in a bush. 'I wanted to ensure the world would know what happened here, that there would be evidence of our experience,' she explained. 'The most critical moment to document was when I realized there was no escape and that I might not survive. I sat alone in that bush for hours, watching in horror as the events unfolded around me. I knew I might be the last witness to what happened there, and I wanted to make sure our story would be told, so even when my phone battery dropped to 2%, I kept filming.' Liron Avigzer hiding in a bush on Oct. 7. Photo credit: Courtesy Courtesy Avigzer says her biggest challenge was the paralyzing fear that kept her from moving or exposing herself. She coped by focusing her mind on a single goal. 'These images and videos show the brutal reality of what happened, illustrate the scale of the disaster, and convey the terror we experienced,' she said. 'Even now, I feel at peace with my decision to document the attack, despite how difficult and painful it was. Recording was an important part of the story and helped me process what I went through. It's a miracle my phone kept working even after eight hours of filming and texting my mom from inside that bush. Finally, my friend who had been at the booth with me called to say a tank had arrived – and that's when I emerged from hiding.' Smartphones as weapons 'The need to document is fundamental to human nature. We want to preserve our experiences and tell our stories,' Nirit Tzuk, an expert in child and youth culture research, explained. 'Throughout history, people have documented their lives through writing or pictures – even in times of great distress. With the rise of screens and social media, the ability to document became more accessible, allowing everyone to share their story online through smartphones and selfies.' Generation Z has taken this impulse even further through social networks. 'Stories have become a tool for sharing everything that happens at the moment, whether it's a meal at a restaurant or a fun outing – but also the difficult things we experience, including moments of fear, crying, or shock,' Tzuk said. 'It's another way for this generation to make their voices heard and, at the same time, call for help. Sometimes, the act of documenting can create a sense of psychological distance, allowing the person to step back and observe the situation.' Video: Liron's footage of the Oct. 7 attack at the Nova Festival site. Credit: courtesy 'By sharing their footage, survivors can show the world the shocking experiences they've endured and ask for it to be spread widely,' Tzuk continued. 'Smartphones have also become a kind of 'weapon', providing a sense of security through apps that can quickly connect to emergency services or loved ones. When Hamas tried to deny what happened, countless Israelis took to social media to share evidence of the atrocities themselves.' 'Technology allows us to keep the story alive' Dr. Ayelet Cohen Wieder, a clinical psychologist on the guidance team of Safe Heart, an organization providing mental health support to Oct. 7 survivors, explains that the need to bear witness is deeply human – and technology now enables it in new ways. 'Documenting their final moments turns victims into witnesses, ensuring their stories become testimony,' she said. 'Technology answers our need to keep our stories alive and existing, even when we are gone.' Is wartime phone documentation unique to Generation Z? 'This is certainly the medium through which they're accustomed to experiencing the world,' Dr. Cohen Wieder noted. 'But from what I've heard from survivors, people of all ages left messages and described what was happening – perhaps as a desperate cry for help, or out of a desire for the world to witness the horror. Documentation can also serve as a form of resistance against an enemy trying to silence and erase our existence. It can be seen as an attempt to connect with the 'sane' world and mentally extract ourselves from an unthinkable situation by communicating with the outside.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/08/i-knew-i-might-be-the-last-witness-oct-7-survivors-explain-why-they-filmed-the-attack/	2024-10-07T18:30:35-07:00	
Israeli Arab teacher arrested for video 'celebrating' Oct. 7 anni...	Israeli authorities have arrested an educator from northern Israel for posting a video on social media that initially appeared to celebrate the October 7 Hamas attacks, as the nation marked one year since the deadly assault, although this was later slammed as a misinterpretation of the meaning of the video. The 41-year-old woman from Tamra, in the Lower Galilee, uploaded a TikTok video of herself dancing at a Nazareth school where she works to the song 'Another Good Time,' with a caption that reads, 'On this day 7/10/23,' but it then turned out that this video had in fact been uploaded well before the war broke out and may have just been simply reposted under the 'on this day' option on TikTok. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir commented on the early morning arrest, stating: 'A teacher from a Nazareth school uploaded a video to social media yesterday, showing herself dancing to the song 'Good Times' with the date 7.10.23 in the background.

Harris ducks question over Iran nuclear bomb	In a wide-ranging 60 Minutes interview, Vice President Kamala Harris addressed critical foreign policy issues, with a particular focus on Iran and US-Israel relations. The conversation began with a direct question about America's greatest foreign adversary. Harris responded unequivocally: 'I think there's an obvious one in mind, which is Iran. Iran has American blood on their hands.' She emphasized the recent attack on Israel, stating, 'This attack on Israel, 200 ballistic missiles, what we need to do to ensure that Iran never achieves the ability to be a nuclear power, that is one of my highest priorities.' The Iranian barrage on Israel on Oct. 1, 2024 (KOKO) KOKO The interviewer asked: 'So if you have proof that Iran is building a nuclear weapon, would you take military action?' To which Vice President Harris responded: 'I'm not going to talk about hypotheticals at this moment.' Harris defended US aid, explaining, 'The aid that we have given Israel allowed Israel to defend itself against 200 ballistic missiles that were just meant to attack the Israelis and the people of Israel.' She highlighted threats from 'Hamas, Hezbollah... Iran,' asserting it is 'without any question our imperative to do what we can to allow Israel to defend itself against those kinds of attacks.' Addressing diplomatic efforts, Harris said, 'The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles, which include the need for humanitarian aid, the need for this war to end, the need for a deal to be done, which would release the hostages and create a ceasefire.' She added, 'We're not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the region, including Arab leaders.' When questioned about Netanyahu's apparent resistance to U.S. advice, Harris countered, 'The work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region.' The interviewer highlighted potential escalation, noting, 'He [Netanyahu] has promised to make Iran pay for the missile attack and that has the potential of expanding the war.' When asked about the personal relationship with Netanyahu, Harris pivoted, stating, 'I think with all due respect, the better question is: do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people, and the answer to that question is yes.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/08/harris-ducks-question-over-iran-nuclear-bomb/	2024-10-07T15:59:23-07:00

The 41-year-old woman from Tamra, in the Lower Galilee, uploaded a TikTok video of herself dancing at a Nazareth school where she works to the song 'Another Good Time,' with a caption that reads, 'On this day 7/10/23' (Screenshot: TikTok) TikTok Kisch addressed the educator's arrest, writing: 'I commend the Israel Police for their decisive action. This is what we expect and how they should respond to any display of incitement and support for terrorism. I want to clarify that this is not a teacher employed by the Ministry of Education, but an external instructor. While the investigation into her case is ongoing, and certainly if she is found guilty, she will not set foot in the education system again.' The suspect will be brought before the Nazareth Magistrate's Court, where authorities will request an extension of her detention.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/07/israeli-arab-teacher-arrested-for-celebrating-oct-7-anniversary/	2024-10-07T08:30:04-07:00	
Eating the Cats' performer wins praise for defending Israel on X	div]:bg-bg-300 [&_pre]:-mr-4 md:[&_pre]:-mr-9'> _*]:min-w-0'> In a social media exchange on X (formerly Twitter), South African musician @TheKiffness and pro-Palestinian account @Africa4Pal engaged in a heated debate over the events of October 7, 2023, with the former correcting his rival on inaccuracies. The exchange which occurred on the one-year anniversary of the horrific Hamas atrocities. Scott, a South African musician, producer, and internet personality, has recently become a household name among millions around the world when he created a remix of former President Donald Trump's comment during a televised debate with Vice President Kamala Harris. Scott, known for his 'cast remixes,' took Trump's own words, in which he accused immigrants in Springfield, Ohio of eating the pets of local residents. The song 'Eating the Cats' became viral overnight. Kibbutz Nirim in southern Israel bordering the Gaza Strip: a damaged house following the deadly October 7 attack by Hamas militants from the Gaza Strip (AFP / Menahem Kahana) AFP / Menahem Kahana The spat began when @Africa4Pal showed tweets posted by Kiffness in which he made sure to show the Israeli version of events, including one replying to South African President Matamela Cyril Ramaphosa, in which the artist said the following: 'Today marks one year since Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel. They murdered over 1180 Israelis and kidnapped 251 people. If you're going to side with Palestine, that is your prerogative, but at least get the facts straight. You are an embarrassment to South Africans who love the truth. Your are not my president.' After @TheKiffness was attacked as being pro-Israel and 'casually overlooking the nuance of the region's troubles' and saying that 'Atrocity blame can be equally allocated,' he shot back, writing: 'We're not talking about nuances here, we're talking about what happened on October 7, 2023.' He went on to and framed the discussion by presenting a binary choice regarding the events of October 7, asking whether it marked 'the start of an onslaught against the Palestinian people' or 'the day that Hamas launched an attack on Israel.' The exchange quickly devolved into accusations of bullying and ad hominem attacks, with @TheKiffness claiming to be the target of personal attacks rather than substantive engagement with his arguments. The introduction of a third user, Yair Katz (@YairKatz), further intensified the debate by praising @TheKiffness for 'standing up for the truth' and accusing @Africa4Pal of supporting Hamas and Hezbollah.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/07/easting-the-cats-performer-wins-praise-for-defending-israel-on-x/	2024-10-07T04:22:31-07:00	
World leaders stand with Israel on Oct. 7 anniversary	US President Joe Biden issued a special statement Monday to mark the first anniversary of the October 7 tragedy. He spoke of a day that should have been a joyous Jewish holiday but instead became the deadliest for the Jewish people since the Holocaust. Biden expressed profound sorrow for the loss of more than 1,200 lives, including 46 Americans, and reaffirmed his commitment to Israel's security and the release of hostages still held by Hamas. In his statement, Biden said: 'Today marks one year of mourning for the more than 1,200 innocent people of all ages, including 46 Americans, massacred in southern Israel by the terrorist group Hamas. One year since Hamas committed horrific acts of sexual violence. One year since more than 250 innocents were taken hostage, including 12 Americans. One year for the survivors carrying wounds, seen and unseen, who will never be the same. And one year of a devastating war.' Biden emphasized that the United States stands behind Israel's right to defend itself against attacks from Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthi rebels. He recalled how American forces assisted in protecting Israel from Iran's ballistic missile attack just last week. A woman looks at charred vehicles burned in the Oct. 7 cross-border attack by Hamas outside the town of Netivot, southern Israel, Oct. 7, 2024 (Photo: AP/Ariel Schalit) AP/Ariel Schalit Biden condemned the global surge in antisemitism and called for a united front against all forms of hatred. He also expressed hope that October 7 would be remembered as a dark day for Palestinians due to the conflict it sparked. 'We will not stop working to achieve a ceasefire deal in Gaza that brings the hostages home, allows for a surge in humanitarian aid to ease the suffering on the ground, assures Israel's security, and ends this war,' he said. The president concluded with a call for unity and reaffirmed his administration's commitment to regional stability and diplomatic solutions. 'We also continue to believe that a diplomatic solution across the Israel-Lebanon border region is the only path to restore lasting calm and allow residents on both sides to return safely to their homes.' Vice President Kamala Harris reiterated her commitment to Israel's security and the release of the hostages: 'I will do everything in my power to ensure that the threat Hamas poses is eliminated, that it is never again able to govern Gaza, that it fails in its mission to annihilate Israel, and that the people of Gaza are free from the grip of Hamas. I will never stop fighting for the release of all the hostages, including the seven American citizens, living and deceased, still held: Omer, Edan, Sagui, Keith, Judy, Gad, and Itay.' French President Emmanuel Macron, who recently suggested considering an arms embargo on Israel, tweeted in Hebrew, English, and French: 'October 7. The pain remains, as vivid as it was a year ago. The pain of the Israeli people. Ours. The pain of wounded humanity. We do not forget the victims, the hostages, or the families with broken hearts from absence or waiting. I send them our fraternal thoughts.' October 7. The pain remains, as vivid as it was a year ago. The pain of the Israeli people. Ours. The pain of wounded humanity. We do not forget the victims, the hostages, or the families with broken hearts from absence or waiting. I send them our fraternal thoughts. — Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) October 7, 2024 European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who was among the first to visit Israel and express public support after October 7, issued a special statement Monday morning: 'There can be no justification for Hamas' acts of terror. They brought immense suffering not only upon the people of Israel, but also upon innocent Palestinians. We reiterate our call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, for the unconditional release of all hostages and for an end to the conflict. One year on, the humanitarian situation in Gaza is appalling. The European Union will keep doing its utmost to mobilise financial assistance and facilitate deliveries and distribution of humanitarian aid, to the Palestinian people, and now also in Lebanon. Hamas' terrorist attacks on Israel ignited a spiral of violence which has brought the entire region to a state of extreme tension and volatility. All parties must act responsibly, with restraint, and engage to de-escalate the current tensions.' She also addressed goals for after the wars end: 'While we address the immediate crisis, the European Union is ready to help prepare for the day after. We will work in support of all efforts to set the conditions for a durable peace, leading to a two-state solution, where Israel and Palestine coexist side-by-side in peace, with security for both. It's the only viable path forward, to finally end the suffering.' The new NATO Secretary General and former Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, expressed support for Israel: 'One year on from October 7, my thoughts are with the people of #Israel, with the families of the victims and hostages taken by Hamas. I welcome efforts by Allies to bring about a ceasefire, the unconditional release of all hostages, and an end to the conflict.' Dutch politician Geert Wilders, known for his staunch support of Israel, tweeted a message of solidarity against the backdrop of the Israeli flag: 'Today we honor the innocent victims of the barbaric Islamic terrorist attack on October 7 last year in Israel. But commemorating isn't enough; there must also be commitment. This day's memory only holds value when we wholeheartedly support Israel in its existential struggle for survival, while those behind the attacks – the terrorist organizations Hamas, Hezbollah, and all their affiliates – are destroyed. We must confront antisemites in our country and expel them wherever possible.' Argentinian President Javier Milei tweeted in Hebrew and English, 'Our hearts are captive in Gaza. BRING THEM HOME NOW.' הלב שלנו שבוי בעזה BRING THEM HOME NOW — Javier Milei (@JMilei) October 7, 2024 Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, a known supporter of Israel, also issued a statement: 'A year after the October 7 massacre it feels as though the world is forgetting the horror and the evil that took place that day. It is time for us to stand with Israel. Bring back moral clarity. Bring back the hostages.'

Matteo Salvini, Italy's Minister of Infrastructure and Transport, wrote: 'A year after the horrific massacre on October 7, our thoughts are with the Israeli people – with children killed in their cradles, young lives cut short, women violated, those who died in captivity, and those still held hostage. We must always remember Israel's right to exist, to defend itself against Islamic terror, and finally to live in peace with its neighbors.' In Germany, the hostage symbol was placed in the German Parliament. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz posted a picture of the hostage symbol in the Bundestag and wrote, 'We share your grief.' Justice Minister Marco Buschmann added: 'The Hamas terror attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, was the largest mass murder of Jews since the end of the Holocaust. Israel continues to be a target for terrorist actions. As any country would, Israel defends itself against these attacks... We protect Jewish life in Germany... We stand with Israel and with the Jews in Germany.' We share your grief. pic.twitter.com/T89QnG1QOE — Bundeskanzler Olaf Scholz (@Bundeskanzler) October 7, 2024 Several foreign ministries worldwide also sent special messages. The Danish Foreign Ministry tweeted: 'Today, on 7 October, we mourn the loss of lives caused by Hamas' brutal terrorist attack against Israel one year ago. More than 100 people are still held hostages in Gaza. Our thoughts go out to all of those affected by the tragic event.' Spain's Foreign Ministry, one of the more critical voices towards Israel, also published a statement. However, Israel's name was notably absent: 'The Spanish Government recalls and restates its strongest condemnation of the atrocious Hamas terrorist attacks of 7 October 2023 and conveys its solidarity to the families and relatives of the victims.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/07/biden-macron-express-solidarity-on-first-anniversary-of-hamas-attack/	2024-10-07T01:30:56-07:00	
Kindergarten teacher turned hero on Ofakim's 'death street'	In the early hours of October 7, 2023, Tali Hadad, a 49-year-old kindergarten teacher and mother of six from Ofakim, was thrust into an unimaginable situation. As Hamas launched its assault on southern Israel, Hadad's maternal instincts and quick thinking led her to become an unexpected hero, rescuing her wounded son and other victims amidst intense gunfire. Hadad's day began at 6:45 am with the sound of sirens and gunfire, signaling an attack far more severe than the typical rocket barrages the region had grown accustomed to over the years. Her son Itamar, a soldier on leave for the weekend, immediately grabbed his rifle and ran towards the danger. 'I ran toward the playground,' Hadad told Fox News Digital. 'I hid behind a wall and saw a line of terrorists walking with rifles, heading in the direction where my son had gone.' Moments later, she heard gunshots and, fearing for her son's life, sprinted towards the sound. Dodging through alleys under heavy fire, Hadad witnessed the unfolding devastation. 'People were yelling from windows, begging for help,' she recounted. 'But there were no ambulances coming, no one to save them.' When she found Itamar, he had been shot multiple times – in the stomach, leg, and thigh. Two of his comrades lay dead beside him. Despite the danger, Hadad made multiple trips to rescue a total of 13 people, driving them to safety at high speeds to avoid terrorist gunfire. 'I knew if I drove slowly, the terrorists would shoot me,' Hadad explained, describing her harrowing journey to the local emergency medical station. The attack on Ofakim, a small city of 50,000 residents located 15 miles from the Gaza border, resulted in 47 deaths. Hadad's street became known as 'Death Street' due to the intensity of the violence there. The remains of a house in Kibbutz Beeri, Israel, near the Gaza Strip, Nov. 1, 2023 (Photo: Moshe Shai) ??? ?? Hadad, like many in Ofakim and across Israel, continues to grapple with the emotional aftermath of the attack. 'We're still bleeding,' she said. The experience has profoundly changed her life, leading her to put her teaching career on hold to care for her recovering son. Five of Hadad's six children currently serve in the IDF, either on active duty or in the reserves. Two are currently fighting in Gaza, while her youngest daughter is set to enter the army in a month. Ofakim is slowly rebuilding. The community has established a memorial, painted murals, and planted olive trees to symbolize resilience and renewal. However, the psychological scars remain deep, with long waiting lists for trauma counseling and overwhelming available resources. In response to the growing need for mental health support, the Israel Psychoanalytic Society and the NGO IsraAid have established a multidisciplinary trauma center offering free services to survivors of the massacre. As Ofakim continues its healing journey, the memories of October 7 remain vivid in the community's collective consciousness. Hadad reflected on the day's impact, saying, 'We remember how our children ran through the streets barefoot, fighting like lions. No politicians come here anymore. No tour buses arrive. But we remember. We will always remember.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/07/kindergarten-teacher-turned-hero-on-ofakims-death-street/	2024-10-06T23:30:34-07:00	
Idan Shtivi declared killed on Oct. 7; body held by Hamas	Idan Shtivi, previously thought to be held captive by Hamas, was killed on Oct. 7, and his body is still being held by the terror group, according to a joint announcement by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum and the Petah Tikva municipality. Shtivi's family received the devastating news Sunday night from IDF officials. He leaves behind his parents, three siblings, and his partner, Stav. 'Idan had a passion for nature, photography, and animals' (sharkandstitch photography) The forum shared, 'Idan Shtivi, 28, had a passion for nature, photography, and animals. He shared a deep connection with dogs and other animals, and was set to begin his second year studying sustainability and government at Reichman University. Idan consistently put others first, often sacrificing his own interests for the sake of others.' On the morning of Oct. 7, Shtivi arrived at the Nova Music Festival to document his friends' performances and workshops, but never made it inside. As the attack unfolded, he helped two strangers – a man and a woman he had just met at the site entrance – to escape. This selfless act ultimately led to his death and capture. IDF representatives informed the family that Shtivi was taken from the Tel Gama area, near Re'im. The decision to officially declare Shtivi's death was based on intelligence information and received approval from a committee of experts from the Health Ministry, in collaboration with the Religious Affairs Ministry and the Israel Police.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/07/hostage-idan-shtivi-declared-killed-on-oct-7-body-held-by-hamas/	2024-10-06T20:00:54-07:00	
Iran 'evil empire,' Israeli leader tells Saudi television	In a wide-ranging interview with Al-Arabiya News, President Isaac Herzog discussed the ongoing conflict in Gaza, tensions with Iran, and his vision for the future of the Middle East. Speaking on the first anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attack, Herzog emphasized Israel's commitment to regional stability while defending its actions in Gaza. Video: Herzog speaks with Al-Arabiya / Credit: Al-Arabiya Herzog did not mince words when discussing Iran, repeatedly referring to the country as an 'empire of evil.' He accused Tehran of fueling conflicts across the region through its proxies, including Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the Houthis in Yemen. Herzog argued that Iran's actions are not only a threat to Israel but to the entire world, citing the disruption of global shipping in the Red Sea as an example. 'Iran is the only country in the world who calls for the eradication of another member state of the United Nations,' Herzog stated, emphasizing the existential threat Israel faces. When questioned about the international community's shifting perception of Israel over the past year, Herzog staunchly defended his country's military operations in Gaza. He insisted that Israel adheres to international humanitarian law and that any instances of misconduct by soldiers are thoroughly investigated and prosecuted. The president acknowledged the suffering of Palestinian civilians but placed the blame squarely on Hamas, accusing the group of using civilian infrastructure to hide weapons and launch attacks. 'We care for the pain of our neighbors,' Herzog said, 'but we have the right to defend ourselves.' Looking ahead, Herzog emphasized the need for a 'day after' plan for Gaza. He expressed hope that regional leaders would be involved in shaping a better future for both Gazans and Israelis. The president drew parallels to Israel's 2005 disengagement from Gaza, lamenting that the vision of creating a 'Hong Kong of the Middle East' was derailed by Hamas's takeover. Herzog called for a 'NATO-like structure' in the region to combat radicalism and promote peace. He highlighted the potential for cooperation between Israel and moderate Arab states, referencing the connectivity plan proposed by President Biden before the October 7 attack.

He expressed concern over Hezbollah's actions, accusing the group of violating international resolutions and putting Lebanon at risk. Regarding Iran's recent missile attack on Israel on Tuesday, Herzog described it as 'extremely unpleasant' but refrained from providing details on potential retaliation. He emphasized ongoing dialogue with the United States on strategic and operational considerations.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/06/iran-evil-empire-israeli-leader-tells-saudi-television/	2024-10-06T04:08:32-07:00	
IDF unveils Hamas arsenal from Oct. 7 attack	Marking one year since the deadly October 7 massacre, the IDF has curated an extensive display of materiel seized from Hamas terrorists who infiltrated Israel that day. The exhibit's purpose is to expose the world to the scale and nature of the threat. The display will be visited by diplomats, representatives from international research institutes, and foreign correspondents throughout the week. Guns from Hamas' October 7 brutal attack on Israel (Photo: IDF Spokesperson's Unit) The exhibit features an array of vehicles and equipment used by the terrorists during their October 7 incursion, including pickup trucks, motorcycles, and tractors. Also on display are uniforms worn by the attackers and intelligence materials recovered in the aftermath. The arsenal showcased includes anti-tank missiles, RPG rockets, various rockets and missiles, explosive devices, small arms, and unmanned aerial vehicles belonging to Hamas. Since the onset of the conflict, the IDF's Unit for Salvage Collection has confiscated approximately 70,000 items, among them about 1,250 anti-tank and RPG missiles and roughly 4,500 explosive devices. Motorcycles from Hamas' October 7 brutal attack on Israel (Photo: IDF Spokesperson's Unit) The Technology and Logistics Division of the IDF, spearheaded by the Unit for Salvage Collection, established the exhibit at the Tzrifin base. This unit, primarily composed of reserve soldiers, is tasked with gathering the weapons displayed in the exhibit. Their responsibilities include locating, documenting, and collecting salvaged materials from all combat zones.

Anti-Israel rallies sweep West ahead of Oct. 7 anniversary	As the world braces for the anniversary of Hamas' deadly Oct. 7 attack, pro-Palestinian groups and organizations supporting Iran's Axis of Resistance have unleashed a wave of protests across Western nations. Some demonstrations featured Hezbollah flags and calls for Israel's destruction, igniting concern among Jewish communities and government officials. Video: Protesters in central Dublin supporting terror organizations Pro-Palestinian organizations and supporters of Iran's regional allies have kicked off a series of demonstrations in Western countries as the world prepares to mark the events of Oct. 7. In some locations, protesters waved Hezbollah flags and chanted for Israel's destruction. Dublin, Ireland's capital, saw pro-Palestinian demonstrations on Saturday, with Hamas and Hezbollah flags flying side by side on O'Connell Street in the heart of the city. Protesters chanted inflammatory slogans, including, 'Hezbollah – make us proud, burn the settlers to the ground.' Another demonstration, ominously titled 'Funeral for Zionism,' is scheduled for tomorrow in Dublin. Protesters wave Hamas and Hezbollah flags in Dublin, Ireland. Photo credit: Reuters These protests have sent shockwaves through Ireland's small Jewish and Israeli communities. Lior Tibet, an Israeli student, shared her experience: 'When the war began, we saw flags of the Popular Front [for the Liberation of Palestine]. We were stunned – how could they wave the flag of a group involved in the massacre? We complained. We yelled. But it fell on deaf ears due to 'freedom of expression.' A year later, we're witnessing Hamas and Hezbollah flags on the streets and calls to bomb Tel Aviv. Are we shocked? No. This is what happens when Ireland's president blames Israel for everything simply because it's popular. Still, witnessing such a display of hatred yesterday, in broad daylight, is incredibly painful – it's a slap in the face to the Israeli-Jewish community here. Feeling that no one will stop this is devastating.' Oslo, Norway, is bracing for both pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian demonstrations on Monday. Similar events marking Oct. 7 are set to unfold in several German cities on the same day, including Berlin and Cologne. Across the globe in Australia, hundreds converged on Hyde Park in Sydney for a large rally supporting Hezbollah and Palestinian groups. Australian authorities warned protesters via large screens that anyone displaying a Hezbollah flag would face arrest. They also prohibited images of Hezbollah's Secretary-General, Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed by Israel, citing the organization's status as a recognized terror group in the country. Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles, while affirming the right to assemble, deemed the timing of the protests 'very regrettable' and urged people not to participate. 'Given what we're commemorating today and tomorrow, these demonstrations are deeply troubling,' Marles stated.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/06/anti-israel-rallies-sweep-west-ahead-of-oct-7-anniversary/	2024-10-06T00:45:22-07:00	
Is this why Hamas kept Hezbollah in dark on Oct. 7?	A new study by the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs reveals that Hamas began implementing its plan for the October 7 attack on Israel as early as 2021. The report suggests that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar aimed to claim the mantle of 'liberator of Palestine' for Sunni Islam, opting to act independently despite alliances with Iran and Hezbollah. Lt Col (Res) Jonathan Dahoah Halevi's study analyzes primary sources from Hamas archives. A key finding reveals that Hamas planned a multi-pronged attack involving territorial seizure, rocket launches, and an uprising in the West Bank. Yahya Sinwar freed in a prisoner exchange for Gilad Shalit in 2011 The research also shows that Hamas exploited Israel's political crisis and its impact on IDF preparedness. The group executed a deception plan, misleading Israel about its true intentions and projecting an image of a deterred organization. Hamas also created a false impression that Israel would primarily face tunnel-based attacks, while the actual assault involved a ground invasion, air and sea infiltrations, and the use of drones. Interestingly, the study notes that Hamas began hinting at the impending attack as early as December 2022, when Sinwar announced a 'roaring flood' (Tufan Hader in Arabic). In preparation, Hamas conducted annual military drills focusing on invading Israel. The final exercise, unusually advanced, took place less than a month before the October 7 attack. These drills incorporated advanced technologies like drones and special forces deployments from the sea, simulating the capture of IDF positions, settlement takeovers, and the kidnapping of Israeli soldiers. The Jerusalem Center points out that while Hamas forged alliances with Iran and Hezbollah, it ultimately decided to act independently. The study suggests that Sinwar viewed the attack as part of an 'end of days' scenario – the Islamic prophecy of Muslim victory over non-believers. The IDF have had chances to kill arch-terrorist leader Sinwar. But he is surrounded by hostages. The bag he's holding in this video is filled with dynamite. 'A few times we have had the chance to kill him, but if we do, he will kill all the hostages around him.' pic.twitter.com/jZEOY4Wl9V — Adam Ma'anit (@adammaanit) October 5, 2024 Halevi states, 'Sinwar needed the alliance with Iran and Hezbollah to build Hamas's military capabilities in Gaza. However, when the moment arrived, it appears he chose to reserve the title of Palestine's liberator for Sunni Islam, rather than ceding it to the Shiite forces of the resistance axis. He likely assumed they would join his campaign against Israel under his leadership.' The report also highlights lessons from Operation Guardian of the Walls, which prompted Hamas to revise its strategy against Israel. The group prioritized military enhancement, force training, and professional preparation to unify all confrontation arenas into a single front. The planned surprise attack was meant to include 'seizing the Galilee and Negev regions, inciting an armed uprising among Palestinians in the West Bank and Arab Israelis, and launching massive rocket and missile barrages to cripple air and sea ports and strike strategic targets.' The study concludes that Sinwar's decision to launch the campaign without prior coordination with Hezbollah disrupted the execution of the original plan.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/06/did-sinwar-act-independently-of-iran-on-oct-7/	2024-10-05T18:30:36-07:00	
Will Iran rush to nuclear weapons amid losses?	According to reporting by The Washington Post, Iran has faced a series of military setbacks in recent months, including the loss of key commanders and allies to Israeli strikes. This has led former US officials and analysts to worry that Iran's conventional losses could trigger a dash toward nuclear weapons capability. Iran has been steadily advancing its nuclear program since 2018, when then-President Donald Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal. Now, experts fear Tehran may increase its use of potential nuclear status as a deterrent against adversaries. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a stark warning after Iran's recent missile attack on Israel: 'Iran made a big mistake tonight, and it will pay for it. The regime in Iran does not understand our determination to defend ourselves and to retaliate against our enemies.' The Iranian attack on Israel. Photo: TPX While Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called the attack 'extraordinary,' he acknowledged recent losses, particularly praising the assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah as a 'brother' and 'shining jewel of Lebanon.' David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, told The Washington Post: 'If the axis of resistance isn't working then the only deterrent might be a nuclear deterrent.' He added that the weakening of Hamas and Hezbollah, combined with Iran's failure to inflict significant damage on Israel, means 'there's a better chance Iran could decide to build nuclear weapons.' The losses to Hezbollah have been particularly devastating for Iran. Sina Azodi, an expert on Iran and lecturer at George Washington University, explained to The Washington Post: 'When you think of a chess board, Hezbollah is Iran's queen. It's the most successful militia force that Iran created.' The degradation of Hezbollah leaves Iran more exposed, as it 'gives Israel more freedom of action in the region,' Azodi added. People visit the site of the remains of an Iranian missile in the Negev desert near Arad on October 3, 2024, in the aftermath of an Iranian missile attack on Israel. Photo credit: Menahem Kahana /AFP AFP Iranian rhetoric around nuclear weapons has shifted noticeably since October 2023. While previously denying intentions to develop such weapons, officials have recently asserted that Tehran possesses the necessary capabilities but chooses not to pursue them. A February report from the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence described the Iranian nuclear threat in starker terms compared to previous assessments. The report stated that while Iran does not appear to be actively developing a weapon, it has 'undertaken activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it chooses to do so.' US officials confirm that Iran could potentially produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a bomb in as little as a few days, although additional time would be needed to develop a reliable nuclear warhead. Missile firing test in Iran (archive). Photo: AFP. As tensions escalate, attention turns to potential Israeli retaliation for Iran's missile attack. Gregory Koblentz, an associate professor at George Mason University, told The Washington Post: 'It is highly likely that this time Israelis will target Iranian nuclear facilities, especially if they believe Iran has already resumed nuclear weaponization work.' Koblentz added that Israel's recent attacks against Hezbollah aimed, in part, to diminish the group's substantial arsenal of rockets and missiles, which were 'widely seen as Iran's insurance policy against an Israeli attack on their nuclear facilities.' He noted, 'With Hezbollah functionally disarmed, for now, Israel has a window of opportunity to strike Iranian nuclear sites and a low risk of retaliation from Hezbollah.' However, experts caution that even a successful strike might only delay Iran's nuclear ambitions. A former White House adviser on nonproliferation, speaking anonymously to The Washington Post, warned that an attack on Iran's main enrichment facilities would 'set back, not end the program' and could potentially lead to 'a change in Iranian nuclear intentions — going from a covert threshold program to an overt weapons program.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/05/will-iran-rush-to-nuclear-weapons-amid-regional-losses/	2024-10-05T13:35:17-07:00
