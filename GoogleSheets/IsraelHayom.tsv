1700 physicians warn of imminent danger to remaining hostages	Within just 12 hours, 1,700 doctors and healthcare professionals signed an urgent petition demanding the immediate release of the remaining hostages in Gaza, following the alarming condition of the three hostages released last Saturday – Or Levy, Eli Sharabi, and Ohad Ben Ami. Israel Medical Association (IMA) Chairman Professor Zion Hagay warned Monday that 'the disturbing images we witnessed upon the release of the three hostages leave no doubt – the government must take every possible action to expedite the release of all remaining hostages, as quickly as possible.' He stated that the returned hostages endured physical and mental abuse along with starvation, and their condition indicates immediate danger to all remaining hostages' lives. 'The images we witnessed reminded us all of humanity's darkest days,' Professor Hagay said, calling on the international medical community 'to look into the eyes of Ohad, Eli, and Or and take a clear and unequivocal stance on the severe health condition of both the released hostages and the many who remain captive.'

Professor Naftali Stern, an endocrinologist and director of the Sagol Center for Epigenetics at Ichilov, who led the petition, addressed the condition of one released hostage: 'Eli Sharabi, who was a full-bodied man, is now just a skeleton. Had he remained there for another two months, what would have been left of him?' Stern, a child of Holocaust survivors, added: 'I am the son of Holocaust survivors, and if there's one message I've passed on, it's 'never again.'' Thousands of protestors react while participating in the weekly rally to released the hostages calling on the continuation of the ceasefire and hostage agreement on February 08, 2025 in Tel Aviv, Israel.

'We have experienced wars as both soldiers and doctors,' the petition states, 'but this is not the situation before us. Israel is no longer in immediate danger and has already struck its enemies decisively, even if the mission is not complete.' 'The sight of the returned hostages caused an emotional collapse and shock,' Professor Stern said. 'We are many months past the existential danger, and there is no reason and no ability to live alongside the fact that dozens of our people are being held in starvation and extermination sites. These people could simply not wake up one morning. Physically, their time has simply run out.' The petition concludes with a grave warning: 'This is not a political position but a medical outcry from doctors and health professionals. Every minute counts. We warn publicly and will warn from every possible platform: those who are still alive will not survive. Their return cannot be delayed by a day, not by an hour.'

Trump says without Iran deal US could 'bomb the hell out of it'	President Donald Trump disclosed plans Friday to broker a deal with Iran that could prevent Israeli military action, telling The New York Post in an exclusive Air Force One interview that he prefers diplomacy over force. 'I would like a deal done with Iran on non-nuclear. I would prefer that to bombing the hell out of it,' Trump said during an exclusive interview aboard Air Force One, emphasizing Tehran's desire for survival. 'They don't want to die. Nobody wants to die.' The president indicated that his diplomatic initiative could potentially prevent Israeli military action against Iran. 'If we made the deal, Israel wouldn't bomb them,' Trump told The New York Post, though he remained deliberately vague about specific details of potential negotiations.

'In a way, I don't like telling you what I'm going to tell them. You know, it's not nice,' he said, suggesting that his proposal could influence Iran's current strategic calculations. The president expressed optimism about potential outcomes if Iran responds positively to his diplomatic overtures. 'I hope they decide that they're not going to do what they're currently thinking of doing. And I think they'll really be happy,' Trump said, emphasizing his commitment to finding a diplomatic solution. While outlining his preference for negotiation, Trump remained firm about his position. 'I'd tell them I'd make a deal,' he said, though he declined to specify potential terms, noting only that he wouldn't pursue military action, saying 'I won't bomb them.' Regarding the specific incentives he might offer Iran, the president maintained his strategic silence, stating only that 'I can't say that because it's too nasty,' while reiterating his preference for diplomatic engagement over military confrontation.

Saudis fume after Netanyahu's statehood joke	Saudi Arabia issued a sharp rebuke to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday, The National reported, rejecting his tongue-in-cheek suggestion that the kingdom could host millions of Palestinians on its territory and sparking a broader diplomatic confrontation. The Saudi Foreign Ministry condemned what it called an 'extremist, occupying mentality' after Netanyahu told Israel's Channel 14, 'The Saudis can create a Palestinian state in Saudi Arabia; they have a lot of land over there,' in response to questions over the controversial US plan to relocate Gazans temporarily in order to rebuild Gaza. Saudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman meets US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, not pictured, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Wednesday, March 20, 2024 (AP/Evelyn Hockstein) In a strongly worded statement, the Saudi Foreign Ministry criticized what it described as ongoing Israeli actions in Gaza without directly addressing Netanyahu's specific comments about relocating Palestinians to Saudi territory. The United Arab Emirates and Egypt joined in condemning Netanyahu's proposal, according to The National. The Saudi statement emphasized that Palestinians have deep historical and legal connections to their land. 'The kingdom stresses its categorical rejection to such statements that aim to divert attention from the continuous crimes committed by the Israeli occupation against the Palestinian brothers in Gaza, including the ethnic cleansing they are subjected to,' the Saudi Foreign Ministry statement said. The ministry added that more than 160,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly children and women, have been killed or injured. 'They are not intruders or immigrants to it who can be expelled whenever the brutal Israeli occupation wishes,' the statement continued. The proposal has drawn particularly sharp criticism from within Saudi Arabia itself. Yousef bin Trad Al-Saadoun, a member of the Saudi Shura Council, responded with a pointed counter-suggestion, Middle East Eye reported. Al-Saadoun proposed that President Donald Trump should consider relocating Israelis to Alaska or 'after annexing it,' to Greenland. Writing in the Saudi newspaper Okaz, Al-Saadoun delivered a stern message about regional sovereignty. 'The Zionists and their supporters must realize well that they will not be able to lure the Saudi leadership and government into the traps of media maneuvers and false political pressures,' he wrote, according to Middle East Eye. The Shura Council member criticized what he characterized as the US approach to Middle East policy. 'The official foreign policy of the United States will seek the illegal occupation of sovereign land and the ethnic cleansing of its inhabitants, which are the Israeli approach and are considered crimes against humanity,' Al-Saadoun said in his Okaz column. He further argued that 'this plan was certainly formulated and approved by the Zionist entity, and was handed over to their ally to read from the White House podium,' Middle East Eye reported. UAE Minister of State Khalifa Shaheen Al Marar expressed full solidarity with Saudi Arabia, declaring the kingdom's sovereignty a 'red line' and rejecting any infringement on Palestinian rights. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks during a press conference in Jerusalem, Dec. 9, 2024 (AP/Maya Alleruzzo) Al Marar called for an end to construction in communities in Judea and Samaria, warning such activities threaten regional stability. He urged the UN Security Council to address practices that violate international law. The Saudi Foreign Ministry's comprehensive statement outlined its position in stark terms, emphasizing the broader regional implications. 'The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia appreciates the condemnation, disapproval and total rejection announced by the brotherly countries towards what Benjamin Netanyahu stated regarding the displacement of the Palestinian people from their land,' the statement read, according to The National. The ministry forcefully rejected what it characterized as attempts to shift focus from the situation in Gaza. In its statement, it emphasized that 'this extremist, occupying mentality does not understand what the Palestinian land means to the brotherly people of Palestine and their emotional, historical and legal connection to this land.' The statement took particular issue with the humanitarian impact of recent events, noting that Israeli actions had 'completely destroyed the Gaza Strip, killed and injured more than 160,000, most of them children and women, without the slightest human feeling or moral responsibility.' Addressing longer-term peace prospects, the Saudi statement pointed to specific obstacles: 'The proponents of these extremist ideas are the ones who prevented Israel from accepting peace by refusing peaceful coexistence, rejecting the peace initiatives adopted by the Arab countries.' The ministry noted these actions had affected Palestinians 'for more than 75 years, with disregard to the truth, justice, law and the values established in the United Nations Charter.' The statement concluded with a firm position on Palestinian rights, declaring they 'will remain firmly established and no one will be able to take it away from them no matter how long it takes.' It emphasized that 'lasting peace will not be achieved except by returning to the logic of reason and accepting the principle of peaceful coexistence through the two state solution.'

Military experts cast doubt on Iran's new drone carrier after spo...	Iran launched the 'Shahid Mahdavi' on Thursday, its first drone carrier vessel for the Revolutionary Guards' naval forces, as reported by Tasnim news agency in an extensive dispatch featuring images and video footage of the large ship and its aircraft complement. However, military analysts identified numerous technical inconsistencies in the presentation, casting doubt on the ship's actual operational capabilities. The footage displayed various drone models either airborne or positioned on the vessel's deck, which bears standard naval gray coloring. The carrier features a 590-foot flight deck suitable for small aircraft operations, having been converted from a commercial vessel with the addition of a flight deck. Released imagery showed three drone variants and four helicopters aboard the vessel, which Iranian authorities claim will extend their strike capabilities well beyond Iranian territorial waters. Revolutionary Guards commander General Hossein Salami stated the ship can conduct 'independent operations' without escort vessels. 'Iran poses no threat to any nation, but we will not yield to any power,' Salami declared. Yet despite the elaborate presentation and commander's bold claims, online observers quickly identified discrepancies in the released materials. 'Iran's boast about launching 24-inch radio-controlled model aircraft from a ship is inadvertently comical. The video later reveals the true scale of the Qaher drone, which is actually ten times larger than shown,' military analyst Oliver Alexander posted on X. Another observer highlighted the conspicuous lack of an arrest system on the 'drone carrier's' deck – essential equipment for landing aircraft. The absence of arrest system preparations on the aircraft themselves raises doubts about Iran's capability to conduct launch and recovery operations from the new vessel.

Former President Donald Trump made a strong commitment to secure the release of all remaining captives from Hamas during the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington on Thursday, with some families of the hostages present.

We are keeping you in our hearts and our prayers. As president, I will not rest until every last hostage is returned,' Trump said. Among those present at the meeting was Noa Argamani, who was rescued in a daring IDF raid in the summer. 'Noa survived the unbelievable and returned by the grace of God – she is an inspiration to everyone,' Trump said, Israel Hayom reported. The meeting comes just days after Trump vowed to let Israel obtain its objectives in the ongoing war with Hamas and even said that the US would 'take over' Gaza after the Palestinians leave it so that it could be rebuilt. This has had a ripple effect around the world, with Trump doubling down on the Gazan emigration scheme on Wednesday, saying that the Israel would hand over the territory to the US after the fighting concludes.

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz has directed the Israel Defense Forces to develop a comprehensive plan enabling the voluntary evacuation of Gaza residents, following President Donald Trump's announcement regarding US control of the Gaza Strip. The initiative, unveiled Thursday morning, represents a significant shift in approach to the region's humanitarian challenges. 'I welcome President Trump's bold initiative,' Minister Katz declared. 'The people of Gaza should have the right to freedom of movement and migration, as is customary everywhere in the world. The plan will include exit options via land crossings, as well as special arrangements for departure by sea and air.' Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Jerusalem, Israel, on June 25, 2024. Photo credit: Abir Sultan/EPA Katz highlighted Hamas' role in the current crisis, stating that the organization has systematically used Gaza residents as human shields, embedded terror infrastructure within civilian areas, and now holds the population hostage, extracting funds through manipulation of humanitarian aid while restricting their ability to leave Gaza. 'Countries such as Spain, Ireland, Norway, and others, which have falsely accused Israel over its actions in Gaza, are legally obligated to allow Gazans to enter their territory. Their hypocrisy will be exposed if they refuse. Meanwhile, countries like Canada, which has a structured immigration program, have previously expressed willingness to take in residents from Gaza.' US President Donald Trump speaks in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, US February 4, 2025. Photo credit: Elizabeth Frantz/Reuters The Wall Street Journal published an extensive report Wednesday detailing the evolution of the US President's plan. According to administration officials versed in Middle East strategy, Trump's proposal was recently developed, maintained under strict confidentiality, and shared exclusively with his closest advisors and confidants. The broader administration remained unaware of the plan's formulation during the period leading up to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit. However, the report indicates that hints of the strategic thinking behind the plan occasionally emerged. During a late summer discussion, Trump characterized the Gaza Strip as prime real estate to Netanyahu, inquiring about potential hotel development opportunities, according to a source privy to the conversation. The newspaper noted that during this exchange, Trump did not mention the possibility of US oversight of the Gaza Strip.

All that glitters: Netanyahu gifts Trump golden pager	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented a symbolic golden pager to US President Donald Trump during their summit meeting at the White House in Washington, marking a significant moment in US-Israel relations. Inscribed with the words 'Press with both hands,' the pager serves as a direct reference to explosive devices that detonated when handled by Hezbollah operatives. The inscription was strategically designed to ensure maximum impact on the target. Upon receiving the gift, President Trump said it was 'a great operation.'

Israel announces withdrawal from UN human rights council	Foreign Minister Gideon Saar declared Wednesday that Israel will withdraw from the United Nations Human Rights Council, aligning with the United States' stance of non-participation in the organization. In a pointed critique, Saar characterized the council as a platform that systematically undermines Israel's diplomatic standing while failing to address genuine human rights concerns globally. Saar argued forcefully that the council serves as a mechanism for protecting human rights violators, enabling them to evade international scrutiny. He specifically condemned the body's 'obsessive focus' on demonizing Israel, the sole democratic state in the Middle East, rather than genuinely addressing worldwide human rights challenges. Israel welcomes President Trump's decision not to participate in the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC). Israel joins the United States and will not participate in the UNHRC. The UNHRC has traditionally protected human rights abusers by allowing them to hide from scrutiny, and… — Gideon Sa'ar | גדעון סער (@gidonsaar) February 5, 2025 The most striking statistic Saar presented was the disproportionate number of condemnatory resolutions targeting Israel. Over 100 resolutions have been passed against the country, representing more than 20% of all council resolutions – a number that surpasses the combined total of resolutions against Iran, Cuba, North Korea, and Venezuela. Moreover, Israel remains the only nation with a dedicated agenda item, which Saar views as clear evidence of institutional bias. By withdrawing from the council, Israel sends a powerful diplomatic message about its unwillingness to participate in what it considers a fundamentally prejudiced international mechanism. Saar's announcement reflects a broader strategy of challenging what Israel perceives as systemic discrimination within multilateral institutions.

Behind the Arab world's opposition to Trump plan	President Trump's remarks triggered a barrage of denunciations from Hamas. His vision, which includes massive Palestinian migration and US ownership of Gaza, directly threatens the terrorist organization's interests. Chief among them is maintaining the population as a human shield and a recruitment pool for terrorists, while continuing to control the Strip from behind the scenes, with the Palestinian Authority functioning as a puppet government. Unsurprisingly, the dramatic announcement caused considerable alarm. Hamas quickly condemned the White House statements and called for an 'emergency conference' of the Arab League, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and the United Nations, aiming to mount pressure against Trump's vision. Hamas understands that the Palestinians alone have limited influence over Washington, particularly under the current administration. Hamas Terrorists. Photo: EPA Yet, Hamas didn't have to work too hard. Arab states were already preparing to block the plan. This week saw a flurry of discussions among Arab leaders, including Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas was invited to Jordan, where he firmly rejected Trump's statements. In recent days, the veteran Saudi prince Turki al-Faisal sent Trump an especially scathing letter. The former Saudi intelligence chief leveled a series of accusations against Israel, blaming it for creating the Gaza problem during the War of Independence. As a Saudi researcher explained in an interview with Israel Hayom, the Palestinian issue has long been exploited by terrorist organizations to target Arab states themselves. This is one of the primary reasons for their strong opposition, and the war in Gaza has only reinforced it. It is no surprise, then, that the Saudi Foreign Ministry issued a harsh response to Trump's claim that Riyadh does not demand a Palestinian state as a condition for normalization with Israel. The statement asserted that Crown Prince bin Salman had repeatedly emphasized that 'Saudi Arabia will not stop working for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital and that there will be no diplomatic relations with Israel without it.' It also highlighted that bin Salman has pressured countries to recognize a Palestinian state, conveying these messages to both the Trump administration and the previous Biden administration. Mohammed bin Salman in a meeting with Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas (Archive), Photo: Reuters Egypt, for its part, faces a constant threat from Islamist movements like the Muslim Brotherhood. Cairo harbors no illusions about Hamas, viewing its leadership as equally responsible for Egyptian soldiers' deaths in the Sinai Peninsula as the local ISIS affiliate. That group received Hamas support from Gaza in the previous decade until a joint Egyptian-Israeli operation dismantled it. Consequently, Cairo is pushing for the Palestinian Authority to take control of Gaza, even if Hamas continues to operate behind the scenes, following the 'Hezbollah model' in Lebanon. Against this backdrop, PA Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa met with his Egyptian counterpart Mostafa Madbouly to 'advance Gaza's reconstruction.' Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdel Aty also stressed the importance of strengthening the PA and transferring control of Gaza to it. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Photo: AFP The same logic applies in Jordan. In response to Trump's remarks, lawmakers proposed a bill to 'prevent Palestinian migration to Jordan,' arguing that such a law would protect 'national unity,' affirm the kingdom's sovereignty, and reject the notion of 'Palestinians migrating to Jordan as an alternative homeland.' A casual observer might think Jordan lacks a significant Palestinian population, when in fact millions of Palestinians already reside in the kingdom. That, precisely, is why Jordan opposes any moves that might provoke unrest and destabilize the state. The current hysteria echoes the paranoia surrounding Trump's previous 'Deal of the Century' initiative, which his administration promoted during its first term. Back then, the Palestinian Authority and Hamas expressed deep concerns over the US plan to allow Israel to extend sovereignty over parts of Judea and Samaria. Ultimately, the main factor that derailed the move was the Abraham Accords with the UAE and Bahrain. The formal normalization between Israel and Arab states sidelined previous declarations about fundamentally reshaping the region. It is not inconceivable that the White House is once again creating a smokescreen, which may ultimately lead to a new agreement, this time with Saudi Arabia. Still, not everyone in the Arab world is alarmed by the idea. Many Palestinians in Gaza, who have long been seeking any possible means to leave, expressed significant interest. This does not apply to the entire population, but to a substantial portion. Since the war began, an estimated 200,000 Palestinians have already left Gaza. Hundreds of thousands more may seize the opportunity to build a new life far from the illusions peddled by terrorist organizations. At the same time, many others in Gaza remain steadfast in their support for Hamas and the concept of 'steadfastness' (sumud), a commitment to staying on the land. Trump's words may only deepen their resolve. Yet cracks are emerging in the so-called 'Arab consensus.' Senior Emirati commentator Amjad Taha questioned, 'Why would anyone want Palestinians to remain in a war-torn region when the world could offer them a lifeline?' He went on to suggest, 'Imagine an international initiative providing Gazans the option to relocate to temporary housing for ten years, away from destruction and danger, while Gaza is rebuilt, cleansed of Hamas terrorists, and transformed into a city of hope rather than hate, a place where children learn love and respect, rather than antisemitism and glorification of violence and abduction.'

In what senior diplomatic sources are characterizing as a watershed moment in US-Israel relations, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu concluded an extensive five-hour White House meeting that sources say exceeded all expectations and carried 'profound implications for Israel's future.' Hamas terrorists secure an area in a square before handing over four Israeli hostages to a Red Cross team in Gaza City on January 25, 2025 (AFP / Omar Al-Qattaa) AFP / Omar Al-Qattaa The prime minister's visit to the White House, which took place Tuesday night, lasted five hours, beginning with President Trump personally greeting Netanyahu at the White House entrance. The two leaders proceeded to the Roosevelt Room, where the prime minister signed the guest book in the presence of both delegations. Netanyahu presented President Trump with both a gold-plated and standard pager as gifts, to which Trump responded, 'That was a tremendous operation,' referring to the sophisticated Israeli attack on Hezbollah in September, which included thousands of exploding pagers killing many of the terrorist group's operatives. Moving to the Oval Office, they delivered statements and fielded press questions before engaging in comprehensive discussions on pressing matters. The American delegation included Vice President J.D. Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, and United States Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff. Secretary of State Marco Rubio joined via secure telephone line. The Israeli delegation comprised Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, National Security Council Chairman Tzachi Hanegbi, Israeli Ambassador to the United States Yechiel Leiter, Chief of Staff Tzachi Braverman, and Netanyahu's military secretary, Major General Roman Gofman. Following these discussions, the prime minister and the president held a private one-on-one conversation. According to the diplomatic source, 'The president sent warm regards to the prime minister's wife, Sara Netanyahu, and their son Yair, recalling how impressed he was with them during dinner at Mar-a-Lago, and particularly noting Mrs. Netanyahu's influence regarding the urgency of securing the hostages' release.' The meeting concluded with a press conference, after which Trump gave Netanyahu a personal tour of the White House's second floor, including the Lincoln Bedroom. They proceeded to a two-hour dinner, characterized by its warm, friendly, and relaxed atmosphere. The president presented the prime minister with an inscribed and signed photograph of them together, reading: 'To Bibi, a great leader.' The diplomatic source emphasized that 'the relationship between Netanyahu and Trump has never been stronger or closer. Those hoping to see rifts between President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu were sorely disappointed. Trump proposed brilliant solutions to challenges that have confronted Israel since its establishment. The prime minister thanked President Trump for releasing weapons that were previously withheld while Israel fought on seven fronts, as well as for his unwavering support of Israel and Prime Minister Netanyahu.' The source added: 'President Trump spoke out against the Deep State in Israel and criticized the absurdity of requiring the prime minister to attend court proceedings three times weekly while managing a war that is reshaping the Middle East. It's now universally understood that attempting to topple a right-wing government during Trump's presidency represents national irresponsibility and severely damages the right-wing camp. We have nearly two years to achieve historic changes, and we must not squander this opportunity.'

US President Donald Trump (R) meets with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on February 4, 2025 (AFP / Andrew Caballero-Reynolds) AFP 'The US will vl the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it, too,' Trump said during the joint press conference with Netanyahu. The president outlined his vision for American oversight of the territory, which would include clearing unexploded ordnance and rebuilding the region's infrastructure. Trump explained his plan would involve leveling damaged structures and fostering economic development to create jobs and housing. 'Do a real job. Do something different. Just can't go back. If you go back, it's going to end up the same way it has for 100 years,' Trump said. 'Level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it out, create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area,' Trump elaborated. The meeting marked Netanyahu's position as the first world leader to visit the White House under Trump's second administration. When asked about the proposed American control of Gaza, Trump expressed his view that US oversight could bring regional stability.

He added that his consultations on the matter had received positive feedback, noting the potential for transforming an area currently marked by destruction. Netanyahu, addressing reporters' questions about Gaza, reaffirmed his three primary objectives, emphasizing the need to prevent future threats to Israel. 'President Trump is taking it to a much higher level,' Netanyahu said. 'He sees a different future for that piece of land that has been the focus of so much terrorism.' The leaders' discussions encompassed the ongoing ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, Iran's regional influence, and plans for relocating Gaza residents to other countries. Trump characterized Gaza's current state as 'a symbol of death and destruction for so many decades,' suggesting that its future should take a different direction from its past. Netanyahu praised Trump's innovative thinking and willingness to challenge conventional wisdom. 'Your willingness to puncture conventional thinking, thinking that has failed time and time and time again, your willingness to think outside the box with fresh ideas, will help us achieve all these goals,' Netanyahu said. The Israeli leader concluded by emphasizing the shared nature of their nations' success, stating: 'Israel's victory will be America's victory. We will not only win the war working together, we will win the peace.'

I will not rest until every last hostage is returned': Trump sta...	Former President Donald Trump made a strong commitment to secure the release of all remaining captives from Hamas during the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington on Thursday, with some families of the hostages present. Trump noted that 'innocent civilians [that were] attacked on October 7 were targeted for one reason because they were Jews they were murdered and kidnapped because of their faith and these events remind us of how blessed we are to live in a nation that has thrived for two and a half centuries as a haven of religious freedom.' US President Donald Trump (R) meets with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on February 4, 2025 (AFP / Andrew Caballero-Reynolds) AFP / Andrew Caballero-Reynolds 'We are joined today by several brave families whose loved ones were taken hostage during the horrible Oct 7 attack. We are keeping you in our hearts and our prayers. As president, I will not rest until every last hostage is returned,' Trump said. Among those present at the meeting was Noa Argamani, who was rescued in a daring IDF raid in the summer. 'Noa survived the unbelievable and returned by the grace of God – she is an inspiration to everyone,' Trump said.'Noa showed unwavering strength courage and Faith as she endured the unendurable what she went through, but by the grace of God she was rescued by the Israeli Defense Forces, and now she's come back to pray with us this morning.' The meeting comes just days after Trump vowed to let Israel obtain its objectives in the ongoing war with Hamas and even said that the US would 'take over' Gaza after the Palestinians leave it so that it could be rebuilt. This has had a ripple effect around the world, with Trump doubling down on the Gazan emigration scheme on Wednesday, saying that Israel would hand over the territory to the US after the fighting concludes.

President Donald Trump called for a 'verified nuclear peace agreement' with Iran on Wednesday, even as his administration moved to tighten sanctions against Tehran. Then-President Donald Trump during an event in New Jersey in 2020 (AP / Alex Brandon) Trump dismissed reports that the US and Israel were preparing military action against Iran as 'greatly exaggerated' in a post on Truth Social, his social media platform. 'I would much prefer a Verified Nuclear Peace Agreement, which will let Iran peacefully grow and prosper. We should start working on it immediately, and have a big Middle East Celebration when it is signed and completed. God Bless the Middle East!' Trump wrote on the platform, Financial Times reported. The statement came as Trump issued an executive order Tuesday signaling a return to 'maximum pressure' sanctions aimed at compelling Tehran to address nuclear concerns. The order directs US agencies to conduct a 'robust and continual campaign' to eliminate Iran's oil exports, including sales to China, Financial Times reported. Iran maintains its nuclear program serves peaceful civilian purposes, though it has enriched uranium to near weapons-grade levels.

Erdogan taking over? Turkey-Syria agreement revealed	Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are expected to discuss a joint defense pact today (Tuesday) in Ankara, which would include the establishment of Turkish air bases in central Syria and training for the new Syrian army, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. During the Syrian civil war, Turkey backed certain rebel groups, including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which was led by al-Sharaa, also known as Abu Mohammad al-Julani According to Reuters sources, including a Syrian security official, two foreign security officials based in Damascus, and a senior regional intelligence officer, the agreement may allow Turkey to establish new air bases in Syria, use Syrian airspace for military purposes, and take a leading role in training the forces of the new Syrian army. Abu Mohammad al-Julani. Photo: Reuters A regional intelligence source stated that potential locations for these air bases include the Palmyra military airfield and the Syrian army's T4 base, both of which were previously used by Iranian militias and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Over the past decade, these bases have been the target of numerous airstrikes attributed to the Israeli Air Force. Last week, al-Sharaa declared himself Syria's interim president, a month and a half after the fall of the Assad regime. In the same speech, he also announced the disbanding of 18 armed militias that participated in the offensive that led to Assad's downfall. 'We have broken the chains of Assad's regime, freed the tortured, and lifted the dust of humiliation and disgrace from the shoulders of al-Sham (the Levant). The sun of Syria has risen again, the people cheered, and the victory was great,' al-Sharaa declared in his speech. Erdogan presides over unprecedented military buildup. Photo: AFP An official from the Syrian presidential office told Reuters that al-Sharaa would discuss with Erdogan 'the training of the new Syrian army, as well as new deployment zones and areas of cooperation,' without specifying the locations. According to the official, Ankara is eager to establish bases in the region as a message to Kurdish autonomy forces in northeastern Syria. Although Turkey has previously threatened military action in the area, it has refrained from doing so while the new Damascus government engages in talks with Kurdish authorities over the fate of their military forces.

Iran preparing for rapid nuclear weapon development	New intelligence obtained by the US indicates that Iran is exploring faster ways to develop a nuclear weapon, according to The New York Times, The report was published overnight (Tuesday). This development comes as Iran's relatively new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has conveyed messages indicating his interest in engaging in dialogue with the new US administration. In addition, The New York Times reports that this intelligence was gathered in the final months of the Biden administration, and was transferred to Trump's team during the transition of power.

American officials told the newspaper that they believe Iran and its Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have not yet made a final decision to develop a nuclear weapon.

Photo: AFP The new intelligence also reveals that, in light of Iran's failure to penetrate Israel's defenses and cause significant damage in its recent attacks, Tehran is examining the development of a new weapon intended to deter Israel and the US from attacking Iran. According to The New York Times, US intelligence estimates indicate that Iran is on the verge of possessing a nuclear bomb. This issue is expected to be a key topic in today's White House meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump.

Saudi researcher: Permanent Gaza ceasefire is prerequisite for no...	Normalization has become increasingly politicized, Saudi Arabia has developed a more nuanced understanding of Israeli dynamics, and security considerations have taken on unprecedented relevance. In an exclusive interview with Israel Hayom, senior Saudi researcher Dr. Aziz Alghashian provides insights into the intricate relationship between Riyadh and Jerusalem, while examining the profound impact of the Oct. 7 terror attack. Born into a prominent Saudi family with close ties to the ruling elite, Dr. Alghashian's early exposure to international diplomacy came through his childhood years in Washington, DC, where his father served at the Saudi embassy in the US. This experience sparked his enduring interest in Saudi foreign policy. After returning to Saudi Arabia in his youth, he pursued what he terms an 'academic journey,' completing his studies in Britain, earning his doctorate from the University of Essex, and teaching international relations and Middle East studies at the same institution. A central focus of his research has been examining why Israel and Saudi Arabia lack formal diplomatic relations despite their apparent convergence of interests. 'The relationship between Israel and Saudi Arabia doesn't follow a linear trajectory. In fact, this process often experiences significant setbacks. The notion that 'my enemy's enemy is my friend' isn't necessarily correct. Many observers view bilateral relations through this simplistic lens, and unfortunately, this perspective persists even now. Even Israel's ambassador to the United States, in his remarks to the Jerusalem Post, continues to embrace this view. However, the reality is far more complex. While shared interests exist, they don't automatically translate into official relations.' Ceasefire for normalization Q: Recent reports indicate renewed interest from the Trump administration in reviving Israel-Saudi normalization talks. 'This clearly ranks among their [the Americans'] top priorities, but the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Israel and the potential for normalization hinges on two key elements – the Palestinian issue, and what can be offered through a US-Saudi agreement in the Senate. These two policy layers create inherent complexity. The outcome always depends on multiple factors. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman attends a EU - Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) summit in Brussels on October 16, 2024. Photo credit: Ludovic Marin/AFP 'We've seen previous instances where normalization discussions were followed by regression. While I acknowledge ongoing efforts, I maintain that a permanent ceasefire is the primary prerequisite for normalization, among other conditions. Furthermore, the Saudis have consistently demanded credible and irreversible steps toward Palestinian statehood. It's worth noting that while these steps have been discussed, such conversations have typically remained confined to Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. The Palestinians must also engage in negotiations and articulate their requirements for these steps. This dynamic reflects the current state of Saudi-Palestinian cooperation. This is what we're observing. 'Regarding the Palestinian component in normalization, a two-state solution framework is essential. Any normalization framework lacking strong, credible, and concrete steps in this direction seems improbable. Why? The Saudis require internal legitimacy. This becomes particularly crucial when considering that not only the broader Arab population but also Saudi citizens are closely monitoring developments in Gaza (during the war). 'Additionally, the Saudis have gained a more sophisticated understanding of how Palestinian and Israeli dynamics have evolved. They've developed insights into Netanyahu's conflict management approach, which involves constraining moderate elements while enabling Hamas, making it difficult to accept superficial gestures toward normalization. The Saudis will need to confront this reality. It's remarkable how some parties seem unwilling to accept 'no' as an answer. The Israel-Saudi normalization issue has become highly politicized in both Israel and Washington, which explains why it generates such extensive discussion.' The Saudi researcher then elaborated on additional factors underlying the Palestinian issue's significance for Saudi Arabia. 'From their perspective, this is fundamentally a security matter. Many overlook that it's not merely about legitimacy. I recall the terrorist attacks against Saudi Arabia, including a wave of al-Qaida violence. While this history might be forgotten or unknown to many outside Saudi Arabia, these terrorists consistently exploited the Palestinian issue. A soldier operating as smoke billows in the Gaza Strip, amid continuing battles between Israel and the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas on December 19, 2023. Photo credit: IDF, AFP When al-Qaida targeted the US, they characterized Americans as occupiers and facilitators of cooperation with Israel. This underscores the necessity of establishing a secure pathway toward Palestinian statehood.' The Palestinian issue Alghashian continued: 'From the Saudi perspective, even before the events of Oct. 7, they maintained that resolving the Palestinian issue was crucial for regional progress, citing the economic benefits of regional stability. However, I believe the Oct. 7 events and their aftermath transformed what was once a theoretical consideration into an immediate Saudi security concern. Essentially, the unresolved Palestinian issue has evolved into a direct security challenge. 'I sincerely believe there are Israelis committed to peace. This is undeniable, and I believe the current moment calls for enhanced dialogue and more proactive engagement,' the researcher concluded. However, he emphasized that despite recent enthusiasm surrounding Israel-Gulf relations and assumptions about moving beyond the Palestinian issue, the actual situation reflects a different reality.

Report: Iran develops nuclear missiles that can hit Israel, Europ...	The British Telegraph reported that Iran is developing missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads with a range of up to 3,000 kilometers, citing information from an exiled opposition group. Additionally, Iran unveiled what it claims to be a new ballistic missile capable of striking targets up to 1,700 km away - well within range of Israel. According to the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), an opposition group, the Ayatollah regime has been using two facilities for missile development, concealing them as communication satellite launch sites. Work at these locations is conducted under strict secrecy and stringent security measures. The report identifies two key facilities where development and production are taking place. The first is located 35 kilometers from the northern Iranian city of Shahroud. The site reportedly employs personnel from the Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research (SPND), which serves as the regime's arm for nuclear weapons development, alongside specialists from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) working on nuclear warheads. Satellite Image of the facility in Shahroud. Photo: David Schmerler/Center for Nonproliferation Studies According to the report, Iran aims to adapt nuclear warheads to be compatible with the Qaem-100 satellite launcher, which has already been successfully used at least three times for satellite launches. This system, the report claims, would enable Iran to target locations within a 3,000-kilometer range, bringing even European targets within reach. The second site, known as the Imam Khomeini Facility, is situated about 70 kilometers southeast of the central Iranian city of Semnan. At this location, Iran is reportedly developing missiles based on North Korea's Unha-1 rocket, which Pyongyang uses to launch satellites into space. The report indicates that the site contains underground facilities and has seen the addition of new structures over the past decade. The opposition organization shared satellite images with the British newspaper, showing suspicious activity at the site, activity that has previously been reported by international media.

The missile, named Etemad, meaning 'Trust' in Persian, was presented as the latest step in strengthening Iran's defensive capabilities. 'Developing defense capabilities and space technologies... aims to ensure that no country dares to attack Iranian territory,' Pezeshkian said in a televised speech. The path to a nuclear weapon To acquire nuclear weapons, in addition to fissile material, two other key components are required: designing the material into a nuclear warhead (where the processes leading to a nuclear explosion occur) and developing a system capable of delivering the warhead to its target, such as a ballistic missile, aircraft, or another platform.

Photo: Reuters While Iran continues to enrich uranium to levels approaching weapons-grade, following the attack on Iran in October 2024, reports indicated that Israel successfully targeted two other pillars of Iran's nuclear program. The first was planetary mixers, which are essential for ballistic missile production. The second, according to a report by journalist Barak Ravid on Axios, was a site in Parchin, where advanced equipment used to create a critical component of a nuclear warhead was reportedly damaged.

Freeing Hostages, ending Hamas rule: Talks on phase two begin	Negotiations on the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement and of hostage deal will begin tomorrow in Washington with a meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff. As stipulated in the initial agreement, talks on the second phase are set to begin on the 16th day of the deal - tomorrow - and it now appears that this is about far more than just another stage in a temporary agreement. Israel seems to be on the path toward a comprehensive diplomatic agreement, with its foundation in Gaza and its head in Saudi Arabia. Netanyahu hinted at this just before his departure when he spoke about broadening the circle of peace. The fact that the talks are being orchestrated by the White House through Ron Dermer and will begin with Netanyahu's own meeting tomorrow, indicates that a significant diplomatic agreement is on the table. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Photo: AP/Evelyn Hockstein Entering the second phase of negotiations Tomorrow, Netanyahu will launch the talks in Washington, while Minister Ron Dermer will act as a senior coordinator on the issue with Witkoff and the US administration moving forward. The actual negotiations will be led by the Israeli negotiating team, headed by Mossad chief David 'Dadi' Barnea, who will only be dispatched for talks with the mediators after receiving directives from the White House. Unlike the previous discussions, which took place in a roundtable format with the participation of the US, Egypt, Qatar, and Israel, this phase will be managed entirely by the White House. Later this week, Witkoff is expected to initiate similar discussions with Qatar's prime minister and senior Egyptian officials, followed by another likely meeting with Netanyahu to coordinate the Israeli delegation's travel schedule for negotiations. Prime Minister Netanyahu and Steve Witkoff. Photo: Maayan Toaf (GPO) The focus of the talks will be political, with security aspects regarding Gaza's future governance, including the end of Hamas rule in the Strip. The negotiations will take place through 'shuttle diplomacy' led by Trump administration representatives, moving between Israel and the mediators following this week's discussions in Washington. It is worth noting that Netanyahu seems to have broad support in his coalition for entering negotiations on the second phase of the deal, which also includes long-term arrangements. Even those who had previously insisted on continuing the war at all costs appeared to have softened their stance over the weekend, allowing the Trump administration to present a formula for ending the war without a return to full-scale conflict. Tens of thousands of Gazans head to northern Gaza. Photo: Reuters With both the US and Israel looking toward Saudi Arabia in the next phase, it is important to note that the second phase and the return of the remaining hostages cannot be finalized without a commitment to ending Hamas rule in Gaza—something that would require Hamas representatives to agree to as well. Until now, Hamas has refused any framework that entails ending the war and its governance, thereby forcing Israel to continue fighting. Now, however, the talks will be restarted under new directives from the White House, and possibly a renewed willingness on the part of the Israeli government to bring the war to an end.

Iran says it has powerful new ballistic missile	Iran has revealed what it claimed to be new ballistic missile capable of travelling 1,056 miles, marking a significant display of military technological advancement during a ceremony attended by President Masoud Pezeshkian. Iran's supreme leader arriving at a joint graduation ceremony for cadets from armed forces academies in the Iranian capital Tehran on October 10, 2023 (Khamenei.ir / AFP) The missile, named Etemad – meaning 'trust' in Persian – was broadcast on state television on Sunday, with officials highlighting its substantial range. According to Agence France-Presse, the Iranian defense ministry described it as their 'most recent ballistic missile'. Western nations have increasingly expressed concerns about Iran's expanding ballistic missile program, viewing it as a potential destabilizing factor in the Middle East. The missile's capabilities are particularly notable as it can potentially reach Israel, which Iran targeted twice during the recent Gaza conflict. President Pezeshkian emphasized the strategic importance of the missile, stating in a televised address that the development of defense capabilities 'aims to ensure that no country dares to attack Iranian territory,' Agence France-Presse reported. The unveiling occurred on Iran's national Aerospace Day, just days before the 46th anniversary of the Islamic Republic's establishment on February 10, 1979. This event follows a pattern of military demonstrations that have intensified since the return of US President Donald Trump, who previously pursued a 'maximum pressure' approach towards Iran. Agence France-Presse noted that Tehran has simultaneously signaled openness to restarting negotiations over its nuclear program, a long-standing source of tension with Western countries. Historically forced to develop its own military equipment after US sanctions following the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran has constructed a substantial domestic arsenal. Despite being under an arms embargo during its devastating war with Iraq from 1980 to 1988, the country has since developed an extensive range of domestically produced weapons, including missiles, air defense systems, and drones. The missile's presentation underscores Iran's continued commitment to military self-sufficiency and technological independence in the face of international sanctions and geopolitical pressures.

Trump's vision for a new Gaza – and how Hamas might surrender	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu embarks Sunday on a Washington visit centered around a pivotal Tuesday meeting with President Donald Trump. While the Prime Minister's Office announced a Friday return to Israel, concurrent preparations suggest a possible extension until the following Sunday. The leadership summit will address all major regional and international issues and their interconnections: Gaza ceasefire status, ongoing hostage liberation efforts, and subsequent phases of the hostage agreement. The agenda encompasses Hamas' eradication from Gaza, Iranian threats – particularly nuclear developments, and normalization agreements between Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the broader Arab world. Hamas terrorists secure an area in a square before handing over four Israeli hostages to a Red Cross team in Gaza City on January 25, 2025 AFP / Omar Al-Qattaa Israel Hayom has learned that mass evacuation from Gaza, including both Hamas operatives and those categorized as 'uninvolved population,' represents a cornerstone of American regional strategy – beyond mere public statements as many Israeli observers believe. During his visit, presidential envoy Steve Witkoff's messages indicated that through substantial Gazan emigration, the administration seeks to align Trump's war conclusion objectives with his stance, shared by many in the new administration, that Hamas must cease controlling Gaza. Significantly, during his Israel discussions, Witkoff stressed that considering October 7's atrocities, he too considers future Hamas governance of Gaza untenable. The American perspective holds that with minimal or no population remaining, Hamas control becomes unsustainable. Arab nations oppose relocation plan A phone conversation between Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi took place Saturday following multiple Arab nations' decisive rejection of Gaza evacuation proposals. Egyptian Presidential Palace communications termed the discussion 'positive dialogue' without elaborating. Earlier, foreign ministers of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates issued a joint statement 'rejecting forced Palestinian displacement while expressing readiness to collaborate with Trump on Israeli-Palestinian two-state solution implementation.' Israel would welcome extensive Gaza emigration, with Minister Ron Dermer, the prime minister's envoy, initially presenting the concept to Trump. However, Jerusalem maintains discretion given the matter's sensitivity. Ruling out Hamas 'shadow authority' In exclusive comments to Israel Hayom, a senior Israeli official suggested Hamas might voluntarily surrender Gaza control rather than face war-end demands. 'The option of renewed military action to achieve objectives remains viable, and we stand prepared,' the official stated. However, they consider Hamas leadership's voluntary relinquishment of control the most probable outcome. 'Within Palestinian faction discussions, Hamas recognizes the necessity of transferring authority. Their desire for ceasefire generates momentum for continued hostage releases. Consequently, further warfare might prove unnecessary, with the framework potentially satisfying war objectives,' the senior official told Israel Hayom. However, they emphasized Israel's rejection of any Hamas shadow authority in Gaza – contrasting with Hezbollah's years of Lebanese dominance.

EXCLUSIVE: Trump support revives Israeli plan for voluntary Gaza ...	A confidential document obtained by Israel Hayom reveals that the Ministry of Intelligence prepared an analysis in the second week of the war concluding that 'voluntary humanitarian evacuation of the civilian population from Gaza to other countries worldwide' represents the option that 'will yield positive, long-term strategic results for Israel.' The ministry advocates this approach over alternatives such as installing Palestinian Authority governance in Gaza or fostering local Arab leadership. Drafted before Israel's ground operation in Gaza, the recommendation to facilitate population evacuation was initially aimed at minimizing civilian casualties. While the Biden administration expressed reservations about Gazans leaving the Gaza Strip, and Egypt's firm opposition ultimately led to shelving the idea, Israeli sources now indicate the proposal has gained renewed relevance, particularly given the possibility of resumed combat operations. These sources point to historical precedent, noting that humanitarian corridors for civilian populations proved crucial during the US-led coalition's campaign against ISIS in the previous decade. The document specifically states that 'humanitarian evacuation of the population from the combat zone serves the best interests of Gaza's civilians.' Displaced Palestinians walk on a road in central Gaza to return to their homes in the northern Gaza Strip, Wednesday, Jan. 29, 2025. Photo credit: Abdel Kareem Hana/AP AP The initiative has gained fresh momentum after President Donald Trump recently voiced strong support for Gaza migration during a meeting with Intelligence Minister Gila Gamliel. This prompted renewed work on the plan originally formulated a year ago. Gamliel, who initiated discussions on the second day of the war and engaged with ministers from potential receiving countries last year, had previously suspended the initiative amid international legitimacy concerns and accusations of forced transfer. Current assessments suggest that securing the first country willing to accept Gaza residents could create a domino effect. Israeli officials estimate that 100,000 to 200,000 Gaza residents have already left the Gaza Strip since the war's outbreak, primarily through the Rafah crossing, with most settling in the Cairo area. An additional 1,000 wounded individuals and their escorts have departed via Israel's Ramon Airport to various countries. Professional sources continue to advocate for building international legitimacy around this 'outside-the-box' proposal. The strategy envisions prioritizing wounded individuals and humanitarian cases for initial departures. While experts anticipate initial criticism and backlash, they believe the international community will gradually accept the concept, noting that the right to emigrate is protected under the UN Declaration of Human Rights.

Photo credit: Brian Snyder/Reuters Israeli sources consistently emphasize, both now and previously, that the proposal strictly excludes forced evacuation, focusing solely on voluntary migration options, whether temporary or permanent. They stress Israel's commitment to allowing all who choose to leave the ability to return to Gaza at their discretion.
