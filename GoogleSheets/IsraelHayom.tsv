Report: Hamas, Israel exchange list of names as hostage talks adv...	Negotiations for a new hostage deal between Israel and Hamas have reached an advanced stage, with both sides exchanging lists of names through mediators, according to Arab media reports. The proposed agreement could include the release of four American citizens held in Gaza who don't meet the humanitarian criteria of previous deals. Israeli sources familiar with the details assess that a 'dramatic development' could occur in the coming days. According to the source, the technical committees from Israel, Egypt, and Hamas have begun working on the details of the hostage deal. The source noted that both sides are showing unprecedented seriousness in reaching an agreement. Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, and the USA are participating in overseeing the negotiations. Rally for the release of Israeli hostages held in the Gaza Strip Gideon Markowicz According to Al-Arabi Al-Jadid, the Hamas delegation, which has since left Cairo, provided Egyptian intelligence officials with a list of names during a visit lasting several hours Sunday. According to the report, the list included names of Israeli hostages who are ill and elderly who should be included in the deal. Hamas also provided a list of prisoners in detention that they want released. Also on Sunday, Hamas announced that its delegation left Cairo after meeting with the head of Egyptian intelligence to discuss efforts for a Gaza ceasefire and the establishment of a committee to manage the strip. The delegation emphasized its pursuit of successful efforts to end the hostilities. The Qatari newspaper reported that Hamas agreed to a 60-day transition phase during which additional fuel and medical supplies would enter Gaza. As of Dec. 9, 101 Israelis are held hostage in Gaza, having been kidnapped by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7. Thirty-six of them have been declared dead.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/09/hamas-israel-reportedly-exchange-list-of-hostages/	2024-12-08T23:54:42-08:00	
Israel seized Syrian side of Mount Hermon	The Saudi outlet al-Hadath quoted a security official claiming Israel has captured the Syrian part of Mount Hermon, the strategic mountain overlooking the Golan Heights, the Galilee, and the Damascus area. This is the first time Israel has been on that part of the mountain since the 1974 Disengagement of Forces agreement, which was signed after the Yom Kippur War. Mount Hermon.

During the visit, they received a detailed briefing on developments along the Syrian border and the reinforcement of IDF forces in the area. Netanyahu characterized the event as 'a historic day in Middle East history,' claiming that the regime's 'collapse is the direct result of our forceful action against Hezbollah and Iran, Assad's main supporters.' He emphasized that the regime's collapse 'set off a chain reaction of all those who want to free themselves from this tyranny and its oppression.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/08/israel-seized-syrian-side-of-mount-hermon/	2024-12-08T07:12:28-08:00

He emphasized that the regime's collapse 'set off a chain reaction of all those who want to free themselves from this tyranny and its oppression.' Video: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visits Israel-Syria border / Credit: X/ IsraeliPM Addressing the security situation, Netanyahu clarified, 'We have to take action against possible threats. One of them is the collapse of the Separation of Forces Agreement from 1974 between Israel and Syria. This agreement held for 50 years. Last night, it collapsed. The Syrian army abandoned its positions. We gave the Israeli army the order to take over these positions to ensure that no hostile force embeds itself right next to the border of Israel. This is a temporary defensive position until a suitable arrangement is found.' Defense Minister Katz reinforced the security message, emphasizing Israel's determination to prevent a return to vulnerability along the border, promising to protect all Golan Heights communities – both Jewish and Druze. While maintaining a firm security stance, Netanyahu delivered a message of openness. He recalled the Israeli field hospital that treated thousands of Syrians during the civil war, noting that hundreds of Syrian children were born in Israel. He extended 'a hand of peace' to the Druze – 'who are brothers of our Druze brothers in Israel' – as well as 'to the Kurds, to the Christians, and to the Muslims who want to live in peace with Israel.' Netanyahu concluded by stating, 'If we can establish neighborly relations and peaceful relations with the new forces emerging in Syria, that's our desire. But if we do not, we will do whatever it takes to defend the State of Israel and the border of Israel.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/08/netanyahu-tours-syrian-border-extends-hand-of-peace-to-rebels/	2024-12-08T06:31:20-08:00	
Plane crash or exile? Mystery surrounds Assad's fate	Syrian rebels declared President Bashar al-Assad's 24-year rule over on Sunday after seizing control of Damascus, while questions swirled about the fate of the longtime leader following reports of a mysterious flight from the capital, according to Reuters. A ullet-riddled portrait of now-toppled Syrian President Bashar Assad in Hama, December 2024 (Omar Haj Kadour / AFP) Omar Haj Kadour / AFP A Syrian Air plane that took off from Damascus airport around the time rebels entered the capital initially flew toward Syria's coastal region, a stronghold of Assad's Alawite sect, before making an abrupt U-turn and disappearing from radar, flight tracking data showed. Two Syrian sources told Reuters there was 'a very high probability' that Assad may have been killed in a plane crash, though this could not be independently verified. The dramatic collapse of the regime sent thousands of Syrians into the streets of Damascus, with witnesses telling Reuters that crowds gathered in a main square chanting 'Freedom' from half a century of Assad family rule. The IDF has assessed that Assad is no longer in Damascus, though they cannot confirm whether he has left the country entirely, according to information shared with Reuters. Military sources indicated that Syria is experiencing significant instability, with the army's dissolution indicating an internal collapse. They noted that the disruption of the Syrian axis, which began following events of October 8 in the northern theater, played a crucial role in current developments. IDF officials emphasized to Reuters their close monitoring of Iranian activity in the region, focusing particularly on preventing military capabilities from moving from Syria to Lebanon. They noted that some Iranian entities are cutting ties with Syria, while warning that Israel would respond decisively if Hezbollah attempts to transfer or concentrate military capabilities along the Syria-Lebanon border. Syria's army command officially notified officers that Assad's regime had ended, according to a Syrian officer who spoke to Reuters. However, the Syrian army later claimed it was continuing operations against what it called 'terrorist groups' in key cities including Hama, Homs, and the Deraa countryside. Prime Minister Mohammad Ghazi al-Jalali called for free elections and said he had been in contact with rebel commander Abu Mohammed al-Golani to discuss managing the transition period. The Syrian rebel coalition said it is working to complete the transfer of power to a transitional governing body. While Israel maintains a policy of non-intervention in Syrian internal affairs, the IDF is closely watching the rebel organization 'Tahrir al-Sham' and assessing its governmental organization and potential impact on the border. Military officials stressed to Reuters that despite this non-intervention policy, Israel will strike against any threats, both ground and aerial. The sudden power shift marks a major setback for Russia and Iran, which had propped up Assad during critical moments in the civil war but were weakened by other regional crises. The developments have stunned Arab capitals and raised fears of new regional instability. Western governments now face decisions about how to engage with a new administration in which Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), formerly an al Qaeda affiliate, appears poised to have significant influence. The group's leader al-Jawlani broke ties with al Qaeda in 2016. 'The real question is how orderly will this transition be, and it seems quite clear that Golani is very eager for it to be an orderly one,' Joshua Landis, Director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, told Reuters. 'They are going to have to rebuild... they will need Europe and the U.S. to lift sanctions.' In Homs, celebratory crowds poured into the streets after the army's withdrawal from the strategic central city. The rebels' capture of Homs gave them control of Syria's heartland and key crossroads, cutting off Damascus from coastal regions where Assad's Alawite sect holds sway and Russian forces maintain military bases. The IDF General Staff is conducting frequent situational assessments and implementing forward defense in the buffer zone to keep threats away from the fence. They remain in contact with UN forces, who maintain their positions in Syria, while closely tracking weapons capabilities and ensuring air and ground superiority in the region. Yesterday, IDF forces worked to remove a threat to UN peacekeeping forces.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/08/plane-crash-or-exile-mystery-surrounds-assads-fate/	2024-12-07T23:57:00-08:00	
Damascus falls as Assad flees country; plane reportedly disappear...	A coalition of Syrian rebel forces claimed Sunday they have entered Damascus and taken control of key positions in the capital, marking a potential turning point in the country's long-running civil conflict. 'Militarily, Damascus has fallen,' a source familiar with the advance told CNN. In a statement posted on Telegram, the Military Operations Command declared: 'We declare the city of Damascus free from the tyrant Bashar al-Assad,' adding, 'To the displaced all over the world, a free Syria awaits you.' Local residents gather on a street in the Damascus suburb of Jaramana on December 8, 2024 (AFP/Louai Beshara) AFP While the rebels assert that president Bashar al-Assad has fled Damascus, Syria's presidential office and Iranian officials have maintained he remains in the capital. US officials told CNN that his regime could soon collapse, as rebels say they are in communication with senior Assad regime officers considering defection. A Syrian Air had left Damascus airport when the capital fell, according to data from the Flightradar website, with rebels claiming they had downed it. It was unclear who was on board. The opposition forces also announced they have 'fully liberated' Homs, Syria's third-largest city, just over a week after capturing Aleppo. Residents were observed removing Assad's posters in scenes reminiscent of pro-democracy demonstrations that occurred in the city during the Arab Spring more than a decade ago. In a significant development reported by CNN, the rebels have taken control of the Saydnaya Military Prison north of Damascus. Amnesty International had previously termed this facility 'the human slaughterhouse' in a 2017 report documenting mass hangings. A July 2023 UN High Commissioner for Human Rights report had highlighted 'continuing widespread and systematic patterns of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, including enforced disappearances' at Syrian detention facilities, including Saydnaya. According to statements released Sunday morning, rebel forces are moving to capture state media offices in Damascus. A resident of the Barzeh neighborhood confirmed to CNN that rebels were present in the area and clashes were occurring. Chaos erupted at Damascus airport early Sunday at 12:28 a.m. local time as the rebel forces advanced into the capital. CNN verified footage showing dozens of people rushing through security checkpoints and hurrying to departure gates in attempts to leave the country. The airport appeared largely unstaffed, with flight monitoring websites showing no scheduled imminent departures.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/08/damascus-falls-as-assad-flees-country-plane-reportedly-downed/	2024-12-07T20:36:22-08:00

Assad regime falls: 'Our sun has finally risen'	Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime collapsed Sunday as opposition forces seized control of Damascus, ending the family's iron grip on Syria. The president fled the country overnight, marking a stunning conclusion to a lightning-fast rebel offensive that took less than two weeks to succeed. Video: Syria's prime minister emerges from residence to meet rebels for power handover. Credit: Arab media 'This historic moment defies description. We fought for this day and brought down the regime. Our sun has finally risen,' a Syrian rebel told Israel Hayom on Sunday morning, as the Assad regime crumbled. Another rebel commander from Idlib Governorate expressed his emotions to Israel Hayom: 'I swear by Allah, the magnitude of our joy is beyond words. The regime's reign has ended and with it, our tragedies. The injustice is over. Fear has vanished along with the dictatorship. Truth has prevailed, as it was destined to do. This was Allah's promise. After enduring displacement, exile, casualties, and financial losses, our patience has been rewarded. Today, we savor the sweetness of victory.' Asked about the rebels' swift success in toppling the regime in under two weeks, he explained: 'Force had to be met with force. Our joint military operations room, established by the rebels and opposition forces, proved decisive. The battles were fierce. By Allah's grace, we prevailed.' Addressing neighboring countries, including Israel, the rebel added: 'We extend our gratitude to all who supported us.'

Photo credit: Louai Beshara/AFP AFP Throughout Syria, videos surfaced Sunday morning showing citizens tearing down statues of Hafez al-Assad, long considered a symbol of oppression. Hafez ruled Syria from 1970 until 2000 before his son Bashar assumed power. The younger Assad fled during the night to an undisclosed location. Dramatic footage emerged showing rebels taking control of prisons in the Damascus and Homs regions. At the infamous Sednaya prison, rebels accessed the control center and liberated inmates, some of whom had been so long imprisoned they struggled to recognize themselves. The Syrian opposition leader, Ahmed al-Shara, also known as Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani, issued directives to all military forces in Damascus, ordering them to maintain distance from public institutions still under the oversight of the Assad regime's prime minister, pending an orderly transition of power. Earlier, Prime Minister Mohammad Ghazi al-Jalali announced his intention to remain in Syria and facilitate an organized transfer of authority to the organizations.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/08/assad-regime-falls-our-sun-has-finally-risen/	2024-12-07T18:30:55-08:00	
Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani: Who is Syria's de-facto ruler?	Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani, the leader of an Islamist insurgent alliance that has recently seized significant portions of Syria in a swift offensive, is working to moderate his image while pursuing his goal of overthrowing President Bashar al-Assad's government, according to The Guardian. In an interview with CNN aired at 3 p.m. on Friday, Jawlani stated, 'When we talk about objectives, the goal of the revolution remains the overthrow of this regime. It is our right to use all available means to achieve that goal.' After years of operating covertly, Jawlani has stepped into the public eye, engaging with international media and making appearances in Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city, following its capture from government forces for the first time in the civil war. Video: Assad statue toppled in Damascus after rebels seize city / Credit: Arab social media His transformation is visible in his appearance – abandoning the traditional turban associated with jihadists in favor of military attire. On Wednesday, he was seen at Aleppo's citadel wearing khaki clothing, greeting crowds from his white vehicle. Since severing ties with Al-Qaida in 2016, Jawlani has attempted to present himself as a more moderate figure. However, according to The Guardian, analysts and Western governments continue to designate Hayat Tahrir al-Sham as a terrorist organization. Thomas Pierret, a specialist in political Islam, told The Guardian, 'He is a pragmatic radical.' Pierret noted that Jawlani's extremist rhetoric peaked in 2014 when competing with ISIS, but has since moderated. Born Ahmed al-Sharaa in 1982 to an affluent family in Damascus's upscale Mazzeh district, Jawlani began signing statements under his real name during the offensive launched on November 27. In a 2021 interview with PBS, he explained that his nom de guerre referenced his family's roots in the Golan Heights, claiming his grandfather was displaced following Israel's 1967 annexation. According to Middle East Eye, Jawlani's path to extremist ideology began after the September 11, 2001 attacks. The news site reported that he attended secretive sermons in Damascus's outskirts before leaving Syria to join the fight following the US-led Iraq invasion. After joining Al-Qaida in Iraq under Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, Jawlani spent five years in detention. He returned to Syria in March 2011 amid the uprising against Assad's rule, establishing the al-Nusra Front as Syria's Al-Qaida branch. In 2013, he refused to pledge allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, instead aligning with Al-Qaida's Ayman al-Zawahiri. By May 2015, Jawlani distinguished himself from ISIS by declaring he had no intentions of attacking Western targets and promising no retribution against Assad's Alawite minority should the regime fall. After breaking from Al-Qaida to avoid Western intervention, Jawlani merged with other Islamist groups in January 2017 to form HTS, controlling parts of Idlib province. The group established a civilian administration, though the UN has classified some of its actions against dissenters as war crimes, according to The Guardian. Recently, Jawlani has addressed Aleppo's residents, including its Christian minority, promising protection under his control. He has also instructed his fighters to maintain security in newly captured areas. Aron Lund, a fellow at Century International, told The Guardian, 'The less local and international panic you have and the more Jawlani seems like a responsible actor instead of a toxic jihadi extremist, the easier his job will become. Is it totally sincere? Surely not. But it's the smart thing to say and do right now.' Throughout this process, HTS faced accusations from residents and rights groups of brutal abuses against those who dared dissent, which the UN has classed as war crimes.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/08/abu-mohammed-al-jolani-who-is-syrias-de-facto-ruler/	2024-12-07T18:30:55-08:00	
Trump credits Assad defeat to 'Israel's fighting success'	Former President Donald Trump wrote in a social media post that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad 'has fled his country,' attributing this alleged development to a dramatic realignment of power in the Middle East and Russia's shifting military priorities. Trump asserted that Iran, a key Assad ally, is in a 'weakened state because of Israel and its fighting success.' Additionally, Russia's mounting challenges in Ukraine have forced Moscow to abandon its longtime Syrian ally. 'His protector, Russia, Russia, Russia, led by Vladimir Putin, was not interested in protecting him any longer,' Trump wrote, emphasizing what he sees as a complete withdrawal of Russian support from Syria. Assad is gone. He has fled his country. His protector, Russia, Russia, Russia, led by Vladimir Putin, was not interested in protecting him any longer. There was no reason for Russia to be there in the first place. They lost all interest in Syria because of Ukraine, where close to… — Donald J. Trump Posts From His Truth Social (@TrumpDailyPosts) December 8, 2024 According to Trump's analysis, Russia's military commitments in Ukraine have reached a critical point, claiming Russian casualties amount to 'close to 600,000 soldiers lay wounded or dead, in a war that never should have started, and could go on forever.' This extensive military engagement, Trump argues, has effectively ended Russia's ability to maintain its strategic presence in Syria. 'There was no reason for Russia to be there in the first place,' Trump stated, suggesting that Moscow's intervention in Syria had become an unsustainable commitment. According to Trump's assessment, this dual weakening of Assad's primary international backers has left Syria increasingly isolated.

He expressed particular concern about the potential for escalation, warning that 'If it keeps going, it can turn into something much bigger, and far worse. Too many lives are being so needlessly wasted, too many families destroyed.' Drawing on his previous diplomatic relationships, the former president stated, 'I know Vladimir well. This is his time to act.' He concluded his message with a call for international intervention, specifically suggesting that 'China can help' and declaring, 'The World is waiting!'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/08/trump-credits-assad-defeat-to-israel-and-its-fighting-success/	2024-12-07T18:30:23-08:00	
Rebels reachd Damascus outskirts, Assad's location unknown	The General Command of Bashar al-Assad's army announced on Saturday evening that its forces are bolstering their positions across the Damascus region to 'prevent incidents resulting from the chaos the terrorists are attempting to create.' The military dismissed what it described as 'false videos' distributed by the rebels.

However, Assad's office denied these claims, asserting that he has not left Damascus. Is the regime in danger? Bashar al-Assad (Archive). Photo: AP Bloomberg News reported that Assad has approached the US through the United Arab Emirates to propose a deal in which he would sever ties with Iran and Hezbollah in exchange for Western assistance to remain in power. In less than two weeks, Assad's regime has lost control of most of its territory, as his allies abandon him. Russia has clarified that it has no plans to rescue the dictator, pro-Iranian militias have retreated to Iraq, and even Hezbollah has deployed only limited forces after suffering significant blows in its conflict with Israel.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/07/rebels-reachd-damascus-outskirts-assads-location-unknown/	2024-12-07T11:29:11-08:00	
Rebels enter Homs, attack UN post in Khader	Syrian rebels announced today (Saturday) that they have taken control of the Quneitra province, near the Israeli border. However, Assad's regime has yet to confirm this claim. Reuters reported that the rebels have also entered the key city of Homs. Despite speculation online, Assad's office denies he has left Syria. Since yesterday, Syrian opposition sources have reported the capture of several towns and villages in the region. The Saudi-based Al-Arabiya channel cited sources claiming that Assad's forces have retreated from both the Quneitra province and areas they previously controlled on Mount Hermon. A Hezbollah source told AFP that the group has dispatched 2,000 fighters to the Syrian-Lebanese border near Qusayr. Reuters also reported yesterday that Hezbollah deployed oversight forces to assist Assad's army in the battle for Homs. Strategic advances by rebels across Syria The Rebels have made significant advances, seizing control of Aleppo, Hama, Daraa, and Quneitra, as well as numerous other towns and cities nationwide. Reports indicate that Assad's forces have withdrawn from the T-4 military airport, which Iran had used to smuggle weapons into Syria. The base is located east of Palmyra in the heart of the Syrian desert. Residents of Hama, Syria, welcome the arrival of the rebels.

Arab media reported this morning that battles between Assad's forces and rebel groups have reached the military academy near Homs in the northwest. Simultaneously, Assad's army and Russian forces are carrying out airstrikes on the Al-Rastan region north of Homs, which is now under rebel control. In southern Syria, Assad's forces have admitted losing control of the cities of Daraa and As-Suwayda, with the military describing their movements as 'redeployments.' In northeastern Syria, Kurdish sources informed Arab media that Assad's forces remain in limited numbers in the cities of Al-Hasakah and Qamishli.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/07/rebels-enter-homs-attack-un-post-in-khader/	2024-12-07T08:10:14-08:00	
Hamas releases video of hostage Matan Zangauker	Hamas released a video this evening (Saturday night) showing a message from Matan Zangauker, exactly 14 months after the October 7 massacre. Zangauker, 24, was abducted on the morning of October 7 from Nir Oz along with his partner, Ilana Gritzewsky, who was later released in a prisoner exchange. His mother, Einav, has become one of the most prominent activists advocating for the release of the hostages, often voicing sharp criticism of the Israeli political leadership, which she accuses of sabotaging potential deals. Video: Matan speaks to his mother Einav in video from Hamas captivity. The family emphasized that the video's release is not 'psychological terror' but rather a sign of life. Einav Zangauker. Photo: Yossi Zeliger The footage was released against the backdrop of reports suggesting progress in negotiations for a hostage deal. Earlier today, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani commented on efforts for a ceasefire in Gaza, claiming that 'the differences over a hostage deal between Israel and Hamas are not substantial.' Palestinian sources told the Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper that Hamas has begun counting the hostages held by its forces and other factions in Gaza. According to these sources, the terrorist organization is working to locate Israeli hostages held by other Palestinian groups, possibly to consolidate information ahead of a potential agreement with Israel.

Rebels enter Homs, attack UN post in Khader	Syrian rebels announced today (Saturday) that they have taken control of the Quneitra province, near the Israeli border. However, Assad's regime has yet to confirm this claim. Reuters reported that the rebels have also entered the key city of Homs. Despite speculation online, Assad's office denies he has left Syria. Since yesterday, Syrian opposition sources have reported the capture of several towns and villages in the region. The Saudi-based Al-Arabiya channel cited sources claiming that Assad's forces have retreated from both the Quneitra province and areas they previously controlled on Mount Hermon. A Hezbollah source told AFP that the group has dispatched 2,000 fighters to the Syrian-Lebanese border near Qusayr. Reuters also reported yesterday that Hezbollah deployed oversight forces to assist Assad's army in the battle for Homs. Strategic advances by rebels across Syria The Rebels have made significant advances, seizing control of Aleppo, Hama, Daraa, and Quneitra, as well as numerous other towns and cities nationwide. Reports indicate that Assad's forces have withdrawn from the T-4 military airport, which Iran had used to smuggle weapons into Syria. The base is located east of Palmyra in the heart of the Syrian desert. Residents of Hama, Syria, welcome the arrival of the rebels.

Arab media reported this morning that battles between Assad's forces and rebel groups have reached the military academy near Homs in the northwest. Simultaneously, Assad's army and Russian forces are carrying out airstrikes on the Al-Rastan region north of Homs, which is now under rebel control. In southern Syria, Assad's forces have admitted losing control of the cities of Daraa and As-Suwayda, with the military describing their movements as 'redeployments.' In northeastern Syria, Kurdish sources informed Arab media that Assad's forces remain in limited numbers in the cities of Al-Hasakah and Qamishli. In addition, the IDF Spokesperson has stated that a short time ago, an attack by armed militants on a UN post in the Khader area of Syria was identified. The IDF is currently assisting UN forces in repelling the attack. The IDF has deployed reinforced units along the Golan Heights front and will continue to act to protect the State of Israel and its citizens.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/06/rebels-enter-homs-attack-un-post-in-khader/	2024-12-05T22:30:14-08:00	
Rebels reached Damascus outskirts, Assad's location unknown	The General Command of Bashar al-Assad's army announced on Saturday evening that its forces are bolstering their positions across the Damascus region to 'prevent incidents resulting from the chaos the terrorists are attempting to create.' The military dismissed what it described as 'false videos' distributed by the rebels. The Syrian rebels, Photo: AFP Syrian rebels told the French news agency AFP that they have begun surrounding Damascus, even as Assad's regime denies retreating from areas near the capital. At the same time, sources told Sky News Arabic that Assad's forces have been ordered to gradually withdraw from the city of Homs. A Syrian rebel fighter, today. Photo: AFP In addition, a source told CNN that Assad is nowhere to be found in the expected locations within Damascus. The source added that the Presidential Guard is no longer deployed at his usual residence, fueling speculation that he has fled the capital. However, Assad's office denied these claims, asserting that he has not left Damascus. Is the regime in danger? Bashar al-Assad (Archive). Photo: AP Bloomberg News reported that Assad has approached the US through the United Arab Emirates to propose a deal in which he would sever ties with Iran and Hezbollah in exchange for Western assistance to remain in power. In less than two weeks, Assad's regime has lost control of most of its territory, as his allies abandon him. Russia has clarified that it has no plans to rescue the dictator, pro-Iranian militias have retreated to Iraq, and even Hezbollah has deployed only limited forces after suffering significant blows in its conflict with Israel.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/05/rebels-reachd-damascus-outskirts-assads-location-unknown/	2024-12-05T11:29:11-08:00	
Syrian rebels capture Hama as Assad forces retreat	Syrian military command announced Thursday that its forces had been engaged in fierce battles against rebel groups along multiple fronts in the city of Hama in recent days. Video: Intense fighting between rebels and Assad's forces in Syria's Hama. Credit: Arab media The military acknowledged sustaining casualties in recent hours. In an unusual admission, the army confirmed that rebel forces had successfully breached Hama's defenses through several access points, despite suffering losses of their own. Subsequently, the Syrian military command announced its units would conduct a 'strategic redeployment' of forces outside Hama. According to reporting by Al-Araby al-Jadeed, citing three Iraqi sources including a senior Baghdad Foreign Ministry official, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has requested direct support from Iraq to prevent additional Syrian cities from falling to rebel forces. The sources revealed that Assad conveyed this request during discussions with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani. The Iraqi parliamentary coalition subsequently convened to discuss the conversation in a session attended by al-Sudani. Pro-Iranian news channel Al Mayadeen reported ongoing confrontations approximately 2.5 miles northwest of Hama, with army reinforcements rushing to the area to counter the rebel advance. Concurrent clashes erupted 9.3 miles from Salamiyah, south of Hama. Rebel forces have deployed drones and mortar shells in their offensive against city districts. Syrian state media swiftly countered reports of rebel advances, asserting that 'all attempts to breach the Hama front have failed.' However, a humanitarian crisis looms as pharmaceutical production facilities have ceased operations, particularly affecting displaced populations who previously fled from Aleppo. Sources speaking to AlHadath news channel reported extensive Israeli strikes targeting weapons storage facilities in the northern Damascus area during the past 24 hours.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/05/syrian-rebels-capture-hama-as-assad-forces-retreat/	2024-12-05T06:15:19-08:00	
Israeli delegation to head to Cairo for hostage deal talks	The Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar reported Thursday that Egypt is awaiting the Israeli government's response to a proposed temporary ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip. Sources informed the Hezbollah-affiliated publication that Egyptian officials cautioned their Israeli counterparts during discussions that rejecting the proposal would lead to 'a dark tunnel with no hope of saving the living hostages.' The report indicated that Egyptian officials conveyed to Israeli leadership that Hamas has demonstrated flexibility during discussions with Egypt's intelligence chief in Cairo regarding the proposal. Arab media reports suggest Israel's response will come with the Israeli security delegation's visit to Cairo, which is expected in the coming days. However, the visit has reportedly been delayed due to several unresolved issues. Egyptian sources indicated the possibility of Israel securing the release of the largest number of hostages to date, partially in exchange for increased humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. The sources also noted that Egypt would serve as a guarantor for Hamas' commitment to the agreement. Chief of Shin Bet (L), the Qatari mediator, and the head of Mossad (R). Photo credit: KOKO/Gideon Markowicz/Reuters Reports indicate that officials from Qatar, Turkey, and the US conducted discussions about the hostage release process and prioritization criteria for determining which individuals would be freed. Egyptian sources expressed confidence in assurances provided by senior officials from President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration. A source close to the negotiations told Reuters that Steve Whitkoff met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed al-Thani in an effort to advance a ceasefire agreement before Trump's inauguration. The source confirmed that Qatar has resumed its role as mediator between Israel and Hamas, with a Hamas delegation expected to travel to Doha for further discussions. Arab media outlets yesterday revealed details from the draft proposal being developed in Egypt. Reports indicate that regional actors are working to adapt the Lebanese model to Gaza, aiming to establish an extended ceasefire lasting approximately two months. The emerging proposal reportedly includes a strategic redeployment of IDF forces within Gaza, rather than an immediate full withdrawal. The proposal also addresses control of the Rafah crossing, with Egyptian officials intensifying pressure on Hamas and Fatah to reach agreements regarding both a committee for Gaza Strip administration and management of the crossing. The proposed framework would transfer control of the southern Gaza crossing to the Palestinian Authority, allowing its reoperation after months of closure.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/05/israeli-delegation-to-head-to-cairo-for-hostage-deal-talks/	2024-12-05T01:56:08-08:00	
Amnesty Israel rejects accusations of genocide	Amnesty International Israel issued a statement Thursday rejecting the main findings of a report released by its global movement, which accuses Israel of committing genocide in the Gaza Strip. The report claims that Israel's actions amount to genocidal practices. However, the Israeli section of the organization has distanced itself from these conclusions, stating that while it recognizes the catastrophic scale of destruction in Gaza, it does not believe the actions meet the legal definition of genocide. The Israeli section emphasized that it neither initiated nor contributed to the report, nor did it support its operational calls. The leadership of Amnesty Israel maintains that while there are voices within the organization that believe the genocide accusation could be substantiated, the majority disagree. Despite this internal division, the organization has made it clear that these views should not be seen as a formal endorsement of the global report's conclusions. Israeli flag placed on a pile of charred vehicles burned in the bloody Oct. 7 cross-border attack by Hamas terrorists, outside the town of Netivot, southern Israel, Jan.7, 2024 (AP/Ohad Zwigenberg) AP/Ohad Zwigenberg Amnesty Israel's position is rooted in the belief that while the scale of violence is undeniable, the evidence does not meet the rigorous legal criteria for genocide, as outlined in the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. In particular, the organization points to the lack of 'specific intent' to destroy Palestinians as a group, a key element required to prove genocide. Amnesty Israel's statement concludes with a call for a comprehensive investigation into potential war crimes by all sides and an appeal for a sustainable peace agreement based on international law, which guarantees the security, freedom, and dignity of all people in the region.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/05/amnesty-israel-rejects-accusations-of-genocide-in-new-report/	2024-12-05T01:24:42-08:00

He was kidnapped from Kibbutz Be'eri on October 7, the same day his parents were killed in the Hamas attack. The recovery comes after confirmation of his death in January alongside fellow hostage Yossi Sharabi after 99 days in Hamas captivity. Shvirsky, from Tel Aviv, had visited Kibbutz Be'eri, where he grew up, on October 7 to see his divorced parents, who lived separately in the kibbutz and were both killed. Shvirsky was with his mother,r Orit, 70, when terrorists entered her room. Both were hiding under a blanket when the terrorists opened fire, killing his mother and reportedly wounding Shvirsky. At the same time, in another house in the kibbutz, his father, Rafi Shvirsky, was killed. His grandmother, Aviva Sela, 97, one of Be'eri's founders, survived miraculously, but her caregiver Grace, who protected her, was killed. Itay Shvirsky (Photo: Courtesy) His body was recovered in a sensitive operation, with details of the location and recovery method withheld to preserve operational security for future missions. In January, Hamas released a video showing Shvirsky and Sharabi – both later killed in captivity – along with Noa Argamani, who was rescued from Gaza in June during 'Operation Arnon.' Noa Argamani paid tribute to Shvirsky, who was with her during their difficult captivity, in an Instagram story posted in July. 'You were by my side throughout the journey, and I by yours. You were my friend, my conversation partner, and the big brother I never had. You taught me about the complexity of the soul and how each of us deals with things differently, that there's no wrong way, each person has their path. I thank you for the days when I was terrified, and you always sai,d 'I'm here with you. It's hard, but I'm here with you,'' she wrote. She continued: 'It's been 191 days that you're not here with me, and it still hasn't sunk in that innocent people are being murdered. All I have left to say is thank you. Thank you for being by my side all this time, thank you for listening to my fears, thank you for simply being there. I promise you'll always be a part of me, that I'll never forget you, and that I'll do my very best to give you a proper burial. I wish you knew how much we all love you. May your memory be blessed.' This week, during a protest outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem, marking one year since the hostage deal, Shvirsky's sister, Meirav, shared her feelings: 'In the week when 105 women, men and children returned, when I knew Itay wouldn't return since he was a 38-year-old man, I was surprised by the intensity of emotions I experienced. Then the stories and testimonies came, including about Itay. From that moment, with every bite, every shower, every time I laid my head on the pillow, thoughts of Itay came, and with them, feelings of guilt.' Following the recovery of Shvirsky's body, 100 hostages remain in Hamas captivity in Gaza, now for 425 days.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/04/body-of-hostage-itay-shvirsky-recovered-from-gaza/	2024-12-04T10:13:31-08:00	
6 hostages whose bodies were returned in August were murdered in ...	The families of six hostages whose bodies were returned to Israel in August 2024 were informed by the IDF this week that their loved ones were killed in Hamas captivity. According to military findings, the hostages – Alexander Dancyg, Yoram Metzger, Chaim Perry, Yagev Buchshtab, Nadav Popplewell, and Avraham Munder – were executed by gunfire inside a Gaza tunnel after an Israeli airstrike targeted underground infrastructure in the area. The military believes the hostages were likely killed shortly after the attack. According to a military investigation, it is likely that the Hamas terrorists guarding the hostages killed them shortly after the Israeli airstrike. The military does not rule out the possibility that other Hamas operatives may have executed the hostages, although this remains unlikely. The six Hamas terrorists who had been guarding the hostages were found dead in the tunnel, likely from asphyxiation caused by toxic gas released during the airstrike. At the time, there was no reason to suspect hostages were in the area, and the IDF did not consider the possibility when planning the strike. The results of the investigation were presented to the families, who were told that even if their loved ones had not been shot, they would have likely died from inhaling toxic fumes from the attack. Israelis rallying for the release of the hostages held by the Hamas terrorist organization in the Gaza Strip (Gideon Markowicz) Gideon Markowicz The hostages had been held in an underground facility until December 2023. After an Israeli ground operation, they were moved to a tunnel in the Hamed neighborhood, about 2.5 miles away, where their last known image was taken. On Feb. 14, 2024, the IDF conducted a targeted strike in the area without knowing that hostages were nearby. Five months later, intelligence indicated that the hostages had likely perished. In August 2024, their bodies were retrieved from the tunnel. IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi acknowledged the failure and emphasized that the mission to bring the hostages home continues. 'We are doing everything we can to bring them back. Every mistake we make is a result of a lack of information, and we must learn from them.' Noam Perry, daughter of Chaim Perry, said, 'The public must understand that military operations endanger hostages. We need to secure a deal now – there is no other way.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/04/6-hostages-whose-bodies-were-returned-in-august-were-murdered-in-captivity/	2024-12-04T07:58:45-08:00	
Israel to interdict Tehran's weapon transfers to Assad regime	Israel will prevent Iran from establishing a significant weapons supply chain to Syria aimed at bolstering President Bashar al-Assad's fight against rebel forces, Israel Hayom has learned. Israel has adopted a calculated neutrality in Syria's civil war, given that Assad's opponents, linked to al-Qaida, maintain hostility toward Israel matching that of Iran. This strategic position has led to a current policy of non-intervention. Syrians gather in the rebel-held northwestern city of Idlib in the early hours of September 28, 2024, following news claiming the death of Lebanon's Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike on Beirut's southern suburbs on September 27, 2024 (AFP/Haj Kadour) AFP/Haj Kadour However, in matters of weapons transfers, Israeli defense analysts view Syria and Lebanon as a single operational theater, concluding that Iranian-supplied armaments will ultimately target Israel. Consequently, the defense establishment has intensified its efforts to monitor and, when necessary, intercept such weapons shipments. Several Iranian supply flights bound for Syria have already been forced to turn back. Social media networks have recently been circulating footage showing substantial Iraqi military forces advancing westward, presumably toward the Syrian border. Intelligence assessments indicate that at least a portion of these forces, operating under Iranian influence, have been deployed to counter anti-regime rebel forces. The Syrian Center reported earlier today that President Bashar Assad's forces received additional reinforcements in the Hama region. Their reports indicate that Assad's army, alongside pro-Iranian militias, successfully pushed rebel factions back 6.2 miles from Hama city.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/04/israel-to-interdict-tehrans-weapons-transfers-to-assad-regime/	2024-12-04T02:31:19-08:00

However, the message did not specify when such a mission might take place.

The hostages – Alexander Dancyg, Yoram Metzger, Chaim Perry, Yagev Buchshtab, Nadav Popplewell, and Avraham Munder – were killed in a tunnel crossing, just like six other hostages who were murdered by Hamas terrorists in a Rafah tunnel: Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Ori Danino, Carmel Gat, Alexander Lobanov and Almog Sarusi.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/04/hamas-reportedly-threatens-to-execute-hostages-if-idf-attempts-rescue/	2024-12-04T00:30:24-08:00	
US report alleges 'revenge and destruction' by IDF	An investigation by The Washington Post has uncovered more than 120 photos and videos posted by Israeli soldiers during military operations in Gaza, reportedly revealing a pattern of destruction and celebratory behavior that has raised concerns about conduct during the conflict. The footage, posted between October 2023 and October 2024, allegedly shows soldiers demolishing buildings, setting fires, and in some cases celebrating the destruction. According to The Washington Post, in one instance, reservists recorded themselves firing a 'farewell barrage' into a residential area as they withdrew from northern Gaza. 'It's a breakdown of not just military discipline, but a break in understanding what it takes to represent the IDF and Israel,' Asa Kasher, who helped author the IDF Code of Ethics and reviewed the videos for The Post, said.

Syrian rebels seize Aleppo as Kurds launch eastern offensive	Syria's complex civil war entered a new phase this week as Islamic rebels consolidated their control over Aleppo, while US-backed Kurdish forces launched a separate offensive against President Bashar al-Assad's army and Iranian-backed groups in the country's eastern regions, significantly altering the conflict's dynamics. The last 24 hours have witnessed intense exchanges of fire between the Syrian Democratic Forces (a Kurdish-led coalition backed by the United States) and Assad's forces alongside pro-Iranian armed groups. Success by the Kurdish-led coalition in this arena could prove advantageous for Israel by disrupting Iranian arms supply networks. Foreign reports indicate that the Syrian Democratic Forces and the Deir ez-Zor Military Council have initiated 'Operation Return,' targeting a series of villages currently held by Assad's forces and pro-Iranian armed groups. Their declared purpose is to enable the return of residents who were previously forced from these villages. The Syrian News Agency, a media outlet aligned with the Assad government, reported that its military and 'auxiliary forces' are responding to an offensive in eastern Deir ez-Zor. The report characterized the Syrian Democratic Forces as 'terrorists belonging to a separatist militia.' In western Syria, the Islamic rebels' command center announced control over more than 15 villages and towns in northwestern Hama province, with forces advancing toward Hama city. This campaign, spearheaded by the jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, carries the name 'Deterrence of Aggression.' The northern province of Idlib has also fallen entirely under their control. Concurrently, the Syrian National Army, comprising various Islamic armed groups, some receiving Turkish support, has opened another front against the Syrian Democratic Forces. These groups are targeting Kurdish autonomous regions in northern Syria through an operation dubbed 'Dawn of Freedom,' designed to diminish Syrian Democratic Forces' influence. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government in Turkey maintains a strategic interest in reducing Kurdish power and is acting in pursuit of this objective. Recent diplomatic engagement between Turkish and Iranian foreign ministers concluded with both sides acknowledging their divergent views on Syrian developments. At a joint press conference, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated, 'it's natural we have differences.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/03/syrian-rebels-seize-aleppo-as-kurds-launch-eastern-offensive/	2024-12-02T23:00:15-08:00	
German hotel's Israeli flag display leads to surge in bookings	Schloss Elmau, one of Germany's most prestigious luxury resorts, owned by Dietmar Mueller, has established itself as a welcoming haven for Israeli visitors. Following the outbreak of war, Mueller took the decisive step of displaying the Israeli flag at the hotel's entrance while also featuring it prominently on the establishment's website. In an exclusive interview with Israel Hayom several months ago, Mueller acknowledged receiving some negative feedback from certain quarters but remained steadfast in his decision to maintain the prominent Israeli flag display at the main entrance. 'The flag stays until all hostages return home,' Mueller affirmed to Israel Hayom. Israeli flag displayed at the Schloss Elmau hotel The hotel, situated a 90-minute drive from Munich, has witnessed an unprecedented surge in Israeli bookings since the conflict began. This remarkable increase is particularly noteworthy given that pre-war travel patterns saw significantly more Israelis venturing abroad, while current travel options remain limited. Nevertheless, the resort continues to experience a substantial rise in demand from Israeli travelers. Hotel statistics reveal 438 overnight stays by Israeli guests in the initial months of this year, marking a significant increase from 185 stays recorded during the same period last year. The establishment's commitment to excellence was further recognized this week when it claimed top honors at the '101 Best Hotels in Germany' awards ceremony.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/03/german-hotels-israeli-flag-display-leads-to-surge-in-bookings/	2024-12-02T23:00:09-08:00	
Mother of Hamas-held US citizen Keith Siegel dies	The family of Keith Siegel, held by Hamas since being taken from his home in Kfar Aza during the Oct. 7 atrocities in 2023, announced the passing of his mother. In an emotional Facebook post, Siegel's daughter Ilan shared the family's anguish: 'My father's mother has passed away, and my father couldn't say goodbye to her because he has been held captive by Hamas for over a year.' The daughter recalled the horrific ordeal Siegel has had to endure since taken by the Isalmic terrorists on that fateful morning, when thousands invaded Israeli territory and killed more than 1,000 and took some 250 captive. Siegel's wife, Aviva, was among those whore returned as part of the Nov. 2023 swap with Hamas. Soldiers removing a body in Kfar Aza after the Hamas massacre (Haim Goldberg/Flash90) Haim Goldberg/Flash90 'My father was forcibly taken from his home by terrorists barely in their twenties. He's being held in dark tunnels, enduring severe hunger and both emotional and physical abuse just an hour's drive from Tel Aviv. While government officials work from secure facilities in the Kirya, he remains trapped in the most horrifying conditions imaginable, with no immediate prospect of return,' she wrote on Facebook.

Child's rampage through Walmart goes viral	A video of a young girl's destructive rampage through a Walmart store, which included smashing glass bottles and throwing merchandise, has garnered nearly 3 million views on social media as observers debate the appropriate response to such behavior. The incident, reported by the New York Post, shows an unsupervised child moving through multiple store sections, pulling items from shelves, and tossing them onto the floor. The situation escalated when the girl reached the store's deli counter, where she began writhing on the floor as two women attempted to intervene. 'Where is her mother – or whoever she's with?' a shopper can be heard asking in the video. Watch as this child destroys a Walmart and a white woman steps in to stop staff and other customers from restraining her while she wreaks havoc. 'Don't yet at her. Don't film her. Don't stop her. You don't know what she's going through.' pic.twitter.com/9JMJTkMckA — Ian Miles Cheong (@stillgray) December 2, 2024 The situation intensified as the child proceeded to a display of sparkling grape juice, where she deliberately shattered multiple bottles, creating hazardous conditions with broken glass and spilled liquid. When a male customer attempted to stop the destruction, an unidentified woman intercepted him, declaring, 'Don't do that to a little girl!' Throughout the incident, the same woman followed the child, warning others against intervention with the statement, 'You don't know what she's going through!' The viral footage has sparked significant online discussion about parenting and accountability. 'There's no justification for allowing your child to run rampant and destroy products in a store. This isn't a place to hold a therapy session,' one X user wrote in response to the video. Store employees, drawn by the commotion, were seen watching the scene unfold but did not directly intervene. The video concludes with an unidentified man carrying the child away over his shoulder.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/03/childs-rampage-through-walmart-goes-viral/	2024-12-02T18:00:50-08:00	
Trump: 'If the hostages are not released, there will be ALL HELL ...	President-elect Donald Trump issued a strong warning to Hamas today (Monday), addressing the terrorists holding hostages in the Gaza Strip. He emphasized that if the hostages are not released before his inauguration on January 20, severe repercussions will follow. On his social media platform, Trump wrote: 'Everybody is talking about the hostages who are being held so violently, inhumanely, and against the will of the entire World, in the Middle East - But it's all talk, and no action!' He continued: 'Please let this TRUTH serve to represent that if the hostages are not released prior to January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume Office as President of the United States, there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against Humanity. Donald Trump (Archive). Photo: AFP Trump added: 'Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW!' The dramatic statement comes following an announcement by the IDF spokesperson regarding the death of Omri Neutra, who was killed in combat on October 7 and subsequently abducted to Gaza by the terrorist organization.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/03/trump-if-the-hostages-are-not-released-there-will-be-all-hell-to-pay-in-the-middle-east/	2024-12-02T14:20:30-08:00	
Iran hackers posed as Israeli officials in plot targeting leaders	The Shin Bet security agency revealed Monday that it has detected roughly 200 Iranian-orchestrated cyberattacks targeting Israeli citizens, including high-ranking public officials and notable public figures, such as attorney Yossi Fuchs. A senior Shin Bet official characterized the campaign as a significant escalation in Iran's ongoing operations against Israel, specifically designed to enable assassination attempts. In a detailed briefing, the security service disclosed that it had identified an extensive Iranian phishing operation in recent months. The targets included senior defense establishment figures, political leadership, academic researchers, media professionals, journalists, and other prominent individuals. The sophisticated campaign sought to compromise targets' digital footprint – including email accounts, computers, and mobile devices – with the ultimate goal of harvesting sensitive personal information. The attackers particularly focused on gathering residential addresses, personal connections, and routine location data. According to security officials, this intelligence was intended to support Iranian-directed operations within Israel, potentially executed through locally recruited cells. The Shin Bet and Israel Police have successfully prevented nine separate attempts by Iranian operators to recruit Israeli citizens for such operations in recent months. The cyber operatives typically initiated contact through WhatsApp, Telegram, or email communications. Each approach was meticulously crafted with a personalized cover story matching the target's professional sphere, designed to appear legitimate and avoid triggering suspicion. The technical aspect of the operation involved two primary attack vectors: persuading targets to download malware-infected applications or directing them to sophisticated phishing websites that mimicked legitimate services. These fake sites prompted targets to enter their email credentials, allowing the attackers to harvest login information and gain unauthorized access to their email accounts. Following the discovery of this campaign and a comprehensive investigation that revealed its full scope and identified compromised individuals, the Shin Bet initiated a large-scale notification operation. This included alerting affected citizens, providing detailed security briefings, and issuing guidance on enhanced cybersecurity measures and personal safety protocols.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/02/iran-hackers-posed-as-israeli-official-in-plot-targeting-leaders/	2024-12-02T05:26:25-08:00	
NYT: Israel built military bases in Gaza	According to a report based on satellite imagery analyzed by The New York Times, Israel has significantly expanded its military footprint in central Gaza, building fortified bases and demolishing hundreds of buildings in recent months, suggesting possible plans for extended control in the region. Israeli forces have transformed a four-mile road known as the Netzarim corridor into an 18-square-mile controlled territory that divides the Gaza Strip. The military has demolished over 600 buildings since early September to create a buffer zone while rapidly expanding a network of bases with defensive fortifications. Twelve of these bases were either built or expanded since early September, indicating an accelerating pace of construction. 'Anything that has been built there can be taken down within a day,' Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli military spokesman, said in an interview with The New York Times. The alleged bases demonstrate a significant investment in infrastructure, featuring paved grounds, walls, barracks, access roads, and parking for armored vehicles. Many are fortified with defensive ditches and mounds to obstruct vehicles, suggesting a long-term presence despite official statements to the contrary. Israeli tanks patrol near the border with the Gaza Strip in southern Israel, 07 January 2024. Photo credit: EPA/Abir Sultan EPA The New York Times claims to have verified 11 drone videos showing the systematic demolition of buildings in the area, providing bird's-eye views of Israel's efforts to remake the geography south of Gaza City. Lt. Col. Shoshani told The New York Times that some of the demolished buildings had been used by Hamas as lookout posts and hiding places. This way, Hamas terrorists would now be less likely to sneak up on Israeli soldiers patrolling the Netzarim corridor or Israeli outposts, Israeli analysts said. The corridor, stretching from the Israeli border to the Mediterranean Sea, enables Israel to regulate movement across Gaza, keeping displaced Palestinians in the south. The controlled area spans roughly 4.3 miles wide and 4.3 miles long. The development comes as Netanyahu has ruled out renewed Jewish settlement in Gaza for now, despite calls from some ministers. The Israeli military presence in the area stems from its campaign against Hamas following the deadly Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, in which approximately 1,200 people were killed – mostly civilians – and 250 taken hostage.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/02/nyt-israel-built-military-bases-in-gaza/	2024-12-02T01:00:56-08:00	
Israel confirms covert hostage negotiations underway	Israeli officials have broken their silence about ongoing confidential negotiations regarding a potential hostage deal, with sources noting that the remarkable absence of leaks – barring minor reports – suggests a serious commitment to the diplomatic process by all parties involved. Sources close to the negotiations emphasize that reaching an agreement will require increased flexibility from both sides. While Hamas has demonstrated some willingness to compromise, questions remain about whether the Israeli government will show similar diplomatic elasticity. Israeli negotiators disclosed that while current talks are proceeding in Egypt without direct Israeli participation, the negotiating team remains fully briefed and engaged in the backstage proceedings. 'There isn't a concrete proposal currently on the table,' one source revealed, 'but new ideas are emerging that we hope will lead to a deal. Hamas' increasing isolation from Hezbollah's support on the northern front has been a contributing factor.'

IDF confirms Iranian-led forces sent against Syria rebels	Iraqi forces backed by Iran have moved into Syria to support the government's efforts to counter insurgents who recently captured parts of Aleppo, according to the IDF and monitoring groups, marking an escalation in the regional conflict. IDF Spokesperson Daniel Hagari told Sky News on Monday that the movement of the Iranian proxies into Syria from Iraq to help the Syrian regime was noted just hours after Israeli officials expressed concern over such a development. 'The Iranian regime is sending reinforcements of forces to Syria, and Israel will prevent Iranian weapons from reaching Syria. Iran has sent dozens of fighters by air to Syria from Iraqi militias loyal to it and from the Revolutionary Guards,' Hagari said. The deployment, reported by The Associated Press, comes as opposition fighters led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham launched a significant offensive last week, pushing into areas around Idlib and Hama provinces while seizing portions of Aleppo, Syria's largest city. Government forces have established defensive positions in northern Hama as they work to halt the opposition's momentum, while airstrikes targeted rebel positions on Sunday, AP reported.

'I clearly announced full-fledged support to President Assad, government, army, and people of Syria by the Islamic Republic of Iran,' Araghchi said, according to AP. After the Damascus meeting, he traveled to Ankara for discussions with Turkish officials, who have supported opposition groups. An Iraqi militia official, speaking to AP on condition of anonymity due to lack of authorization to address the media, confirmed that Tehran-aligned Iraqi forces already in Syria had mobilized, with additional units crossing the border to support Assad's forces. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitoring group, reported that approximately 200 Iraqi fighters in pickup trucks entered Syria through the Bou Kamal border crossing overnight. These forces are expected to deploy to Aleppo to assist in the Syrian army's counter-offensive, the monitor told AP. Meanwhile, Syrian and Russian forces continued aerial bombardment of opposition positions, primarily in Hama and Idlib provinces. The Syrian Civil Defense reported at least 10 civilian casualties in Idlib city and surrounding areas. In the north, Kurdish civilians fled as Turkish-backed opposition forces captured Tel Rifaat from US-supported Kurdish authorities. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces largely withdrew from the area and requested humanitarian corridors to facilitate safe passage of civilians toward Aleppo and eventually to Kurdish-controlled northeastern regions.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/02/idf-confirms-iranian-led-forces-sent-to-repel-syrian-rebels/	2024-12-02T00:38:53-08:00	
IDF says Israeli-American hostage Omer Neutra was killed on Oct. ...	The IDF announced Monday morning that Israeli-American hostage Cpt. Omer Neutra, captured during Hamas' Oct. 7 assault on southern Israel, was killed in action that day. The announcement comes after extensive analysis of intelligence and evidence gathered since the attack, according to the Military Rabbinate. Neutra, whose body is being held by Hamas, commanded a strategic position near Nir Oz and led the first response forces against the pre-dawn invasion. His tank came under heavy fire from a large contingent of Hamas terrorists, resulting in the deaths of two crew members. Neutra and fellow soldier Nimrod Cohen were captured in the assault. In an interview with Israel Hayom earlier this month, his family revealed their journey from Israel to America two decades ago, where they established an international laboratory research enterprise. Omer and his younger brother Daniel, 20, were born and raised in the United States, immersed in both Jewish tradition and pluralistic values as part of a Conservative Jewish community. The family's world was shattered on Oct. 7 when footage emerged showing their son being pulled from his burning tank. 'We want people to know Omer,' his mother Orna said. 'At 18, he went to Israel for a gap year program and discovered his true calling. He realized that simply feeling love for Israel wasn't enough – he needed to take action.' Despite having secured university admission, Neutra chose to enlist in the IDF. 'We supported his decision completely. He joined the Armored Corps and quickly rose to a command position.' Their final conversation took place on Oct. 6. 'Omer told us they had reduced the alert level for Simchat Torah, suggesting a quieter holiday ahead,' Orna recalls. 'He was commanding an armored position near Nir Oz, with two tanks and several Golani Brigade infantry soldiers under his command. The weeks before had been intense with frequent border incidents, so we were relieved he would have some respite.' The next morning brought devastating news as Hamas launched its unprecedented attack. All contact was lost with Omer. After an agonizing night, the family received footage showing their son's capture from his destroyed tank. Since that moment, they have been living through what his mother described as an 'unending nightmare.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/02/idf-says-israeli-american-hostage-omer-neutra-was-killed-on-oct-7/	2024-12-02T00:23:59-08:00	
In battle and captivity: Tank Crew 3 tragic fate on Oct. 7	The story of Tank Crew 3 encapsulates the tragic events of Oct. 7. On Monday, the IDF confirmed that its commander, 22-year-old Capt Omer Neutra from Long Island, was killed and his body taken captive. His crew – three teenage soldiers barely out of high school – shared the same fate, marking one of the darkest chapters in Israel's recent history. Tank Crew 3 was led by Capt Omer Neutra, commanding three 19-year-old soldiers: Cpl Nimrod Cohen as gunner, Sgt Oz Daniel as radio operator-loader, and Sgt Shaked Dahan as driver. The crew was assigned to Battalion 77 of the 7th Brigade, positioned near the White House Outpost between the kibbutzim of Nirim and Nir Oz. In conversations with their families, they described grueling shifts in their tank, sometimes lasting up to 18 hours. Gazans take control of an Israeli tank after crossing the Photo credit: Said Khatib/AFP AFP When Hamas launched its surprise attack on Oct. 7, the crew immediately mobilized to defend their sector. However, their tank experienced a critical malfunction – reportedly a brake failure – that left them vulnerable. This mechanical failure allowed Hamas terrorists to approach the tank, plant explosives, and capture all four members. During testimony before the civilian inquiry commission, Nimrod Cohen's parents unveiled a series of operational failures that culminated in their son's capture. They described severe technical issues with the tank, noting that 'the brakes locked up, reducing the tank's speed to 5 mph – merely walking pace,' which made it an easy target for Hamas fighters to disable. Yehuda Cohen, Nimrod's father, painted a disturbing picture of operational negligence at the border position. He described soldiers waiting exposed at their posts for tank carriers to arrive, widespread equipment maintenance issues, and personnel walking their posts without weapons. 'The atmosphere resembled a summer camp,' he testified, 'reflecting leadership's misguided message that everything was under control.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/02/in-battle-and-captivity-tank-crew-3-tragic-fate-on-oct-7/	2024-12-01T23:25:07-08:00	
Israeli assessment: Assad allows Iranian forces into Syria	The Syrian rebel offensive, spearheaded by Tahrir al-Sham, a rebel group supported by Turkey, commenced on Wednesday. On Sunday, Israeli officials asses that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is allowing Iranian forces into Syria to bolster his regime and counter rebel factions in the ungoing civil war. This move could significantly affect the dynamics along Israel's northern border.

Syrian rebels surround Damascus	Syrian opposition forces have captured the village of Deir Hafer east of Aleppo, Arab media outlets reported overnight Saturday. The northern Syrian city is largely under rebel control, with the remaining portion held by Kurdish forces. Further south, opposition forces have reached the northern outskirts of Hama. Simultaneously, developments are unfolding in southern Syria. Al-Arabi channel broadcast footage of demonstrations in the Damascus area supporting the operations of Islamic rebels. Pro-opposition protests were also documented in the southern city of Daraa, where demonstrations against the Assad regime have been ongoing for several months. Opposition sources in the Daraa region told Al-Arabi Al-Jadid newspaper that rebel infrastructure is already in place there. According to these sources, the goal is to conduct a 'pincer movement from south and north' to attack the capital, Damascus. Reports indicated that the capital witnessed military deployments by Assad regime forces. A local website in Daraa also reported that local factions plan to conduct military operations against Assad army checkpoints in southern Syria. Video: Syrian opposition soldiers playing with a statue head of Hafez Assad / Credit: Arab social media A Syrian source close to the opposition emphasized that, unlike in the past, operations in the south and north will have a higher level of coordination. 'The Assad regime is in a weak position, as are its operators. This is a golden opportunity for Syrians. Syria cannot become a developed country unless this tyrannical regime is removed,' the source said. In northern Syria, the rebels' operations department announced they had taken control of Aleppo and the entire Idlib governorate and succeeded in blocking the road between Aleppo and Raqqa (an eastern provincial city and another key stronghold).

These are the rebels fighting the Iranian axis in Syria	Syrian rebels stunned the world on Wednesday with a large-scale surprise attack on the defensive lines of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime in the country's north. In less than 72 hours, the rebels seized vast parts of Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city, which had taken Assad's forces over four years to capture from the opposition. Video: Rebels arrive in Aleppo, Syria. Source: Arab networks The rebels employed tactics all too familiar to Israelis: rocket fire, drones, and surprise raids by light forces using pickup trucks from hidden positions and pre-prepared tunnels to evade the Russian and Syrian air forces that dominate the skies. The operation was a resounding success, leaving the Syrian army and its allies—Iranian militias and Russian forces—caught off guard and in disarray. Images and videos circulated of rebels celebrating their victory, taking prisoners, capturing abandoned Syrian military equipment, and chanting religious slogans with fervor. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Photo: Reuters But who are these rebels, and where did they emerge from after years of Syria's civil war slipping from global awareness? The answer is complex, much like the intricacies of Syrian insurgent politics. Broadly speaking, the rebel forces can be divided into two primary factions. Tahrir al-Sham The first faction is Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), or simply Tahrir al-Sham. This is an extremist Islamist organization with roots in al-Qaeda operatives who joined the uprising against Assad early on. HTS is led by Abu Mohammad al-Julani, the most powerful figure among the Syrian rebels and the driving force behind the northern offensive. The rebels in Syria. Photo: Reuters HTS has been preparing for this offensive for over two years, undergoing extensive training—likely with funding and support from Gulf states—and building underground command infrastructures while stockpiling weapons and ammunition from Turkey. How extreme is HTS? While Julani has softened some of his positions over the years, at least publicly, many of the group's members are former al-Qaeda and ISIS fighters, some of whom proudly bear the Islamic State flag on their uniforms. The Syrian National Army The second major force leading the offensive is a coalition of dozens of groups under the umbrella of the 'Syrian National Army' (SNA), a body that receives direct military support from Turkey and enjoys unwavering backing from Ankara. The groups within the SNA are diverse, ranging from moderate, nationalist-oriented factions to outright Islamist groups. Notably, not all these groups cooperate smoothly; in recent months, some have openly clashed with one another. Residents of Idlib in northern Syria celebrate the rebels' takeover of Aleppo. Photo: AFP While only one of these factions is directly linked to Turkey and its support, both rely heavily on Turkey's military presence in northern Syria for survival. Turkey's involvement in northern Syria, particularly between 2017 and 2018, helped the rebels stabilize their frontlines and prevent the fall of Idlib Province, the last major rebel stronghold in Syria. This province has become a kind of 'Wild West,' using Turkish currency and hosting hundreds of thousands of refugees struggling to survive in dire conditions. The perfect storm From this region, which spans large parts of northern Syria, the rebels have been meticulously planning to take back their country. A lethal convergence of Turkey's desire for revenge against Moscow and the weakening of the Iranian axis—due to the blows suffered by Hezbollah in Lebanon—turned months of meticulous preparation into a 'perfect storm.' The Syrian civil war, far from over, continues to reshape alliances and redraw the lines of conflict, with consequences reverberating across the region and beyond.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/30/these-are-the-rebels-fighting-the-iranian-axis-in-syria/	2024-11-29T14:20:55-08:00	
UAE official visits family of slain Rabbi Kogan	Dr. Ali Rashid Al Nuaimi, a senior representative of the United Arab Emirates authorities, arrived at the shiva (seven-day mourning period) in Jerusalem on Friday to express his sincere condolences to the family of Rabbi Zvi Kogan, the Chabad emissary who was killed in Abu Dhabi on November 24, 2024, emphasizing the UAE's unwavering commitment to coexistence and rejection of extremism. During his conversation with family members, Nuaimi emphasized that the UAE will continue to advocate for coexistence and never allow extremists to divide us. 'The state and its citizens are more committed than ever to the values of openness and peace and will increase their efforts to ensure that Rabbi Zvi's legacy continues and that all communities live in harmony in the UAE,' the senior official said.

Nuaimi holds the position of Chairman of the Defense Commission of the Federal National Council's Internal and External Relations Committee. In practice, he can be described as a senior advisor whose words reflect the position of the president of the UAE, Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Nuaimi was among the major proponents of the Abraham Accords and is known as a harsh critic of radical Islam. For instance, in a special interview marking the first anniversary of establishing relations with the UAE, he said of radical Islam: 'This is not Islam, and it does not serve the interests of Muslims worldwide. Instead of religion uniting all human beings, they developed a narrative of hatred.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/29/uae-official-visits-family-of-slain-rabbi-kogan/	2024-11-29T00:00:40-08:00	
Is Tehran changing course amid Trump win and Hezbollah setback?	Iran appears to be recalibrating its regional strategy following Donald Trump's election victory and the weakening of its proxy Hezbollah, the New York Times has reported based on multiple sources familiar with Tehran's decision-making process. In a notable shift from its typically aggressive stance, Tehran has made several conciliatory diplomatic moves. These include dispatching a senior official to Beirut in mid-November to encourage Hezbollah to accept a ceasefire with Israel, and its UN ambassador meeting with Elon Musk, seen as an attempt to establish communication channels with Trump's circle. Seven Iranian officials, including one from the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), told the New York Times that Trump's Nov. 5 election victory prompted this strategic shift. They cited concerns about renewing confrontation with an administration that had previously pursued a 'maximum pressure' campaign against Iran. Donald Trump stands on stage with Melania and Lara Trump, Nov. 6, 2024, West Palm Beach, Florida (AP/Evan Vucci) AP/Evan Vucci This diplomatic pivot represents a stark departure from late October, when Iran was preparing for a potential strike against Israel. At that time, a deputy IRGC commander had declared, 'We have never left an aggression unanswered in 40 years.' The change in approach also follows significant losses by Hezbollah in its confrontation with Israel. According to Iranian media reports, there is growing discontent among displaced Lebanese Shia communities who traditionally look to Iran for protection. Mehdi Afraz, director of research at Baqir al-Olum University, offered an unusually frank assessment: 'Our friends from Syria called and said the Lebanese Shia refugees who support Hezbollah are cursing us up and down, first Iran, then others. We are treating war as a joke.' Iran's domestic challenges have also influenced this shift. The country faces mounting economic pressures, with the government recently announcing daily power cuts. The death of hard-line president Ebrahim Raisi and the election of moderate Masoud Pezeshkian in July has brought promises of economic reform and increased Western engagement. Several senior Iranian officials have indicated openness to negotiations with the incoming Trump administration on nuclear and regional issues. 'Iran is now applying restraint to give Trump a chance to see whether he can end the Gaza war and contain Netanyahu,' said Seyed Hossein Mousavian, a former Iranian diplomat now at Princeton University. 'Without doubt in Iran, among senior officials and ordinary people, there is a real desire to end the tensions with the West and to get along,' Naser Imani, an analyst close to the government, told The New York Times. 'Cooperation with the West is not viewed as defeat, it is seen as transactional diplomacy and can be done from a position of strength.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/28/is-tehran-changing-course-amid-trump-win-and-hezbollah-setback/	2024-11-28T04:59:22-08:00	
Hamas signals openness to Gaza ceasefire after Hezbollah deal	A high-ranking Hamas official has told French news agency AFP Wednesday that the terror group is prepared to enter into a ceasefire arrangement mirroring the recent agreement between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Though the source did not specify ceasefire terms, Hamas has maintained its demands for a permanent cessation of hostilities, backed by international guarantees and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip. Palestinians celebrate by a destroyed Israeli tank at the Gaza Strip fence east of Khan Younis, Oct. 7, 2023 (AP/Hassan Eslaiah) AP/Hassan Eslaiah On Tuesday, an Egyptian diplomatic mission arrived in Israel to explore possibilities for a hostage deal that could potentially expand into a broader ceasefire in Gaza. Previously, Hezbollah had conditioned its cessation of fire toward Israel on the termination of the IDF's military operation in Gaza. The organization has now abandoned this position, leaving Hamas alone in the fighting against IDF forces. Of the Israelis taken hostage by Hamas during the Oct. 7 massacre, 101 remain in captivity, with 35 declared dead	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/27/hamas-signals-openness-to-gaza-ceasefire-after-hezbollah-deal/	2024-11-26T23:00:05-08:00	
US guarantees on Israel's ceasefire rights to stay classified	An American side letter guaranteeing Israel's rights in case of ceasefire violations will remain classified, Israeli officials announced following a cabinet meeting, casting uncertainty over the document's effectiveness as a diplomatic safeguard. The document, secured through extensive negotiations between Minister of Strategic Affairs of Israel Ron Dermer and the US administration, had been touted by the Prime Minister's Office as a major diplomatic achievement that would guarantee Israel's right to resume military operations if the agreement was breached. Cabinet ministers who reviewed the letter during the session described it as comprehensive, covering various scenarios of potential violations. However, Israeli officials have now indicated that the letter, obtained during President Biden's current term, will remain sealed, raising questions about its practical enforceability.

A notable example was the letter from President George W. Bush that accompanied Israel's 2005 Gaza withdrawal. In a televised address Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu first spoke to residents of northern Israel: 'This war will not conclude until all our objectives are met, and at this stage, specifically not until we can ensure the safe return of northern residents to their homes.'

These achievements demonstrate Israel's power throughout the Middle East, and directly to Iran, which stands at the head of this network. I am resolved to take all necessary steps to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.' Addressing the hostage situation, Netanyahu declared: 'In Gaza, we have dismantled Hamas's battalions, eliminated Sinwar, Deif, and their leadership echelon, and secured the return of 154 of our hostages. We remain committed to bringing everyone home and ending their families' unbearable suffering, just as we are committed to completing Hamas's elimination. In Syria, we are systematically preventing weapons transfers to Lebanon. Assad needs to understand – he is playing a dangerous game.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/27/us-guarantees-on-israels-ceasefire-rights-to-stay-classified/	2024-11-26T20:00:18-08:00	
UNRWA announces closure of east Jerusalem headquarters	UNRWA has announced the closure of its East Jerusalem headquarters, following recent Israeli legislation severing ties with the organization. Palestinian employees have been notified that their positions at the Sheikh Jarrah (Shimon HaTzadik) facility will be terminated. According to reports published by Saudi news network AlHadath, employees have been given a 12-month grace period to find new employment, after which their contracts with the United Nations organization will be terminated. UNRWA's presidential office in Sheikh Jarrah houses the organization's legal department, which oversees the agency's legal matters across all areas of operation. The facility also includes the agency's spokesperson's office and its central communications department. A Palestinian woman stands outside the UNRWA Gaza Headquarters (AP/Khalil Hamra) AP/Khalil Hamra The Saudi network also reported that the agency's foreign employees will not be dismissed but instead will be reassigned to the agency's offices in Amman, Jordan. Following the revelation of UNRWA staff and institutions' involvement in acts of terror, particularly in the Oct. 7 massacre, the Knesset passed two significant laws last month to curtail the organization's activities in Jerusalem and Gaza. The first law, initiated by Knesset members Boaz Bismuth and Sharren Haskel, which passed its second and third readings, now prohibits UNRWA's operations in the Shuafat refugee camp in Jerusalem and all of the organization's activities in East Jerusalem. The second law, initiated by Knesset members Yulia Malinovsky, Dan Illouz, Ron Katz, and others, prohibits contact between Israeli government officials and UNRWA personnel. The implications: denying organization members the ability to work in Gaza, travel to it, or operate there in general.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/26/unrwa-announces-closure-of-east-jerusalem-headquarters/	2024-11-26T01:11:20-08:00	
UN advisor fired over refusal to label Gaza war as genocide, WSJ ...	An op-ed published by the Wall Street Journal editorial board titled 'The UN's anti-Israel 'genocide' purge' claims the United Nations' decision not to renew Alice Wairimu Nderitu's contract as Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide stems directly from her refusal to characterize Israel's military campaign in Gaza as genocide. 'The United Nations long ago lost credibility as a moral arbiter, but its assault on Israel is hitting a new low,' the op-ed began. The UN has decided to fire its Special Advisor on the Prevention of Genocide. Alice Wairimu Nderitu from Kenya is being forced out because she publicly said that Israel's operations in Gaza don't meet the definition of genocide. pic.twitter.com/eceOYCHryM — Visegrád 24 (@visegrad24) November 26, 2024 The editorial board quotes her UN biography, which describes her as a 'recognized voice in the field of peacebuilding and violence prevention.' She has served since 2020 and is being dismissed 'because she has stood firm in her belief that Israel's war with Hamas isn't genocide.' They note that her position has put her at odds with 'the anti-Israel cabal at the UN.' Nderitu's office previously issued guidance in 2022 stressing that UN officials should 'Adhere to the correct usage' of the term genocide, warning against 'its frequent misuse in referring to large scale, grave crimes committed against particular populations.' In defending Nderitu's position, the WSJ editorial board emphasizes the legal requirements for classifying violence as genocide. 'As a legal matter, establishing a pattern of violence as a genocide requires demonstrating intent,' they write. 'Israel's campaign of self-defense doesn't qualify. The war against Hamas has had many deaths, but Israel's strategy is intended to dismantle a terrorist regime, not eliminate an ethnic group.' The board adds that 'The Jewish state has gone to great lengths to minimize Palestinian civilian casualties, even as Hamas uses civilians as shields so their deaths can be used as propaganda.' But, 'That's not what the anti-Israel cabal at the UN want to hear.' The editorial points to mounting pressure from other UN officials, particularly Austrian Volker Turk, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, who the board says 'has spent the past year assailing Israel.' This culminated in a November 14 report from the UN Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices that supported 'serious concerns of breaches of international humanitarian and human rights laws' and 'the possibility of genocide in Gaza and an apartheid system in the West Bank.' UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk addresses media personnel in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Wednesday, Oct. 30, 2024 (Photo: AP /Mahmud Hossain Opu) AP 'The word has become a weapon of political propaganda that will erode its moral authority when it's needed to describe genuine horrors,' the editorial board argues. A UN spokesperson maintained that 'Alice Nderitu is leaving the UN as her contract is expiring,' adding that 'Genocide is strictly defined in international law and any legal determination' is made by 'appropriate judicial bodies.' However, the WSJ editorial board argues this explanation rings hollow, noting that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has the authority to extend such contracts, which are 'often renewed when their terms expire,' Nderitu's 'removal is a political choice.' The board characterizes Nderitu's stance as 'a profile in courage' for 'her refusal to endorse a lie in service of a political agenda,' while questioning whether 'anyone with integrity can survive at the UN.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/26/un-advisor-fired-over-refusal-to-label-gaza-war-as-genocide-wsj-argues/	2024-11-25T23:00:57-08:00
