UN Secretary-General, UNRWA nominated for Nobel Prize	UN Secretary-General António Guterres, the UNRWA agency, and the International Court of Justice in The Hague have all been nominated for the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize, as reported by Reuters on Thursday. According to the report, experts close to the process told the news agency these two organizations and the veteran diplomat are considered frontrunners in the race for the prize, which supposably aims to honor those who have brought peace, security, and the protection of the vulnerable.

Since taking office, Russia has invaded Ukraine, committing numerous atrocities. Additionally, devastating civil wars have broken out in Myanmar, Sudan, and Ethiopia, and the Middle East has entered an unprecedented state of conflict that has claimed tens of thousands of lives. In Israel, Guterres is viewed as pro-Palestinian, and this week Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz declared him a 'persona non grata' - an unwelcome persona - within the State of Israel, following his refusal to condemn Iranian aggression after a missile attack on Israel earlier this week.

Throughout the past year of fighting in Gaza, the extent of the Hamas' infiltration into the UN agency has repeatedly come to light. The organization itself admitted that some of its employees, including senior figures, participated in the massacres of October 7 and in the kidnapping of Israeli civilians. The organization's schools and supply systems were commandeered by Hamas, and the group even established a computer and server base beneath UNRWA's headquarters in Gaza City.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/03/un-secretary-general-unrwa-nominated-for-nobel-peace-prize/	2024-10-03T10:00:48-07:00	
AP under fire for describing Hezbollah leader 'charismatic and sh...	The Associated Press (AP) found itself at the center of controversy after publishing a biographical article about Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah that painted the terrorist group's chief in an overly positive light. The article, which appeared to be a preemptive piece anticipating Nasrallah's potential death after the IDF's strike on Hezbollah's headquarters, initially bore the headline 'Charismatic and shrewd: A look at longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.' This characterization drew immediate comparisons to The Washington Post's controversial description of al-Qaida leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as an 'austere religious scholar' following his death in 2019.

The rapid edit seemed to be a direct response to the flood of criticism on X, formerly known as Twitter. AG Hamilton, a prominent social media user, highlighted the disparity in AP's treatment of different figures by juxtaposing the Nasrallah headline with one about the late US Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK). The latter read: 'Former US Sen Inhofe, defense hawk who called human-caused climate change a 'hoax,' dies at 89.' .@AP I'm sorry for your loss.

Rep Mike Waltz (R-FL) dismissed AP's portrayal, stating, 'Nasrallah was a ruthless, murderous terrorist.' Similarly, Rep Anthony D'Esposito (R-NY) asserted, 'Nasrallah is not a 'charismatic leader.'

Mike Waltz (@michaelgwaltz) September 28, 2024 The Daily Wire noted that AP's article went through 12 paragraphs before mentioning the word 'terrorist.' Instead, it referred to Nasrallah using terms such as 'astute strategist,' 'archenemy of Israel,' and 'a fiery orator viewed as an extremist.' This incident marks one of many in which renowned media outlets, such as AP, were scrutinized for their portrayal of Israel's ongoing conflict with Gaza's Hamas and Lebanon's Hezbollah. A comprehensive study has revealed that the BBC's coverage of the Israel-Hamas conflict was markedly biased against Israel, with the British broadcaster reportedly violating its own 'editorial guidelines' more than 1,500 times. Other prominent international media outlets were criticized mainly on social media for refraining from using the word 'terrorist' or 'terrorism' in describing Hamas and Hezbollah since the war broke out after Hamas' deadly attack on Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapping 250.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/29/ap-under-fire-for-describing-hezbollah-leader-charismatic-and-shrewd/	2024-09-28T20:00:06-07:00	
US is sending $375 million in military aid to Ukraine and will an...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration said Wednesday that the U.S. will send Ukraine an undisclosed number of medium-range cluster bombs and an array of rockets, artillery and armored vehicles in a military aid package totaling about $375 million; a U.S. official also said billions more in assistance over the coming months would be announced Thursday. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the $375 million package as global leaders met at the U.N. General Assembly this week and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy used his appearance there to rally support. Zelenskyy will meet with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris in Washington on Thursday to continue his push to get them to allow his troops to use long-range weapon s to strike deeper into Russia. The package announced by Blinken includes air-to-ground bombs, which have cluster munitions and can be fired by Ukraine's fighter jets, as well as munitions for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), Javelin and other anti-armor systems, Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, bridging systems and other vehicles and military equipment. 'The United States is committed to Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s brutal aggression,' Blinken said in a statement. 'We will deploy this new assistance as quickly as possible to help Ukraine protect its territory and its people.' The latest package of weapons, provided through presidential drawdown authority, is one of the largest approved recently and will take stocks from Pentagon shelves to deliver the weapons more quickly to Ukraine. It comes as nearly $6 billion in funding for aid to Ukraine could expire at the end of the month unless Congress acts to extend the Pentagon’s authority to send weapons from its stockpiles to Kyiv. A U.S. official said, however, that the Biden administration is expected to notify Congress on Thursday of its intent to spend the remaining amount of money under presidential drawdown authority contained in the supplemental budget for Ukraine after the current fiscal year that ends Sept. 30. That amount, $5.5 billion, must either be used or notified to Congress by Sept. 30 or be lost and returned to the Treasury. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the expected move, said lawmakers would be told that the administration will spend the money in multiple aid packages that will be announced after Oct. 1, in the next budget year. Ukrainian and Russian forces are battling in the east, including hand-to-hand combat in the Kharkiv border region where Ukraine has driven Russia out of a huge processing plant in the town of Vovchansk that had been occupied for four months, officials said Tuesday. At the same time, Ukrainian troops continue to hold ground in Russia’s Kursk region after a daring incursion there last month. The aid announcement also came on the heels of Zelenskyy's highly guarded visit on Sunday to a Pennsylvania ammunition factory to thank the workers who are producing 155 mm shells, one of the most critically needed munitions for his country’s fight to fend off Russian ground forces. Including this latest package, the United States has provided more than $56.2 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since Russian forces invaded in February 2022. ___ Lee reported from New York.	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-us-to-send-375-million-in-military-aid-to-ukraine-including-medium-range-cluster-bombs/	2024-09-25T16:02:47-07:00	
Ukraine's president calls for unspecified global 'action' to forc...	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Ukraine’s president dismissed the notion of peace talks with Moscow on Tuesday, calling instead for unspecified global 'action' to force Russia into peace for invading his country and to comply with the U.N. Charter’s requirement that every country respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all other nations. Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the U.N. Security Council that Russian President Vladimir Putin is committing 'an international crime' and has broken so many international rules that he won’t stop on his own. 'And that’s why this war can’t simply fade away. That’s why this war can’t be calmed by talks,' Zelenskyy said at a meeting on the sidelines of the annual gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly. 'Russia can only be forced into peace, and that is exactly what’s needed — forcing Russia into peace as the sole aggressor in this war, the sole violator of the U.N. Charter.' The high-level meeting on the more than 2½-year war in Ukraine was attended by ministers from 14 of the council's 15 member nations. Russia chose to send its lower-level U.N. ambassador. Vassily Nebenzia opened the meeting protesting that Zelenskyy was being given the U.N. spotlight again. He also criticized Slovenia — which holds the rotating council presidency this month — for allowing the Ukrainian leader's 'chorus' to speak. He meant about 10 European Union and NATO members who aren’t on the council but march 'in lockstep' every time they come to the council 'to malign the Russian Federation.' 'When it comes to listening to these hackneyed statements, and these cookie-cutter statements, we have no intention of wasting time on that,' Nebenzia said. Ukraine's sovereignty is defended U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres briefed the council, reiterating the United Nations’ strong support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity under the U.N. Charter. 'Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 – following the illegal annexation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and city of Sevastopol a decade ago – is a clear violation of these principles,' the U.N. chief said. Zelenskyy said Ukraine knows some countries want to talk to Putin. But, he asked, 'What could they possibly hear from him — that he’s upset because we are exercising our right to defend our people, or that he wants to keep the war and terror going just so no one thinks he was wrong?' China has repeatedly called for talks between Ukraine and Russia. Its foreign minister, Wang Yi, told the council that the suffering and destruction and increasing volatility in the region 'must be turned around.' Wang stressed that Chinese President Xi Jinping believes 'the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected.' China is pursuing peace talks and conducting shuttle diplomacy, Wang said, and its efforts have received wide international support. He pointed to a joint China-Brazil peace plan issued earlier this year. Zelenskyy also went after countries that supply weapons and ammunition to Russia, telling the council Moscow has no legitimate reason to make Iran and North Korea 'de facto accomplices.' The U.S. includes China, Iran and North Korea in its accusations U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken raised similar issues but also accused China, which has close ties to Russia, of providing Russia with machine tools, microelectronics and other items it is using 'to rebuild, restock and ramp up its war machine and sustain its brutal war.' Wang, who spoke after him, didn't directly respond but said: 'I also wish to make it clear that on the Ukraine issue, any move to shift responsibility onto China or attack and smear China is irresponsible and will lead nowhere.' Blinken also accused Iran of providing armed drones to Russia since 2022 and transferring hundreds of short-range ballistic missiles a few weeks ago – which its new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has denied. North Korea has also delivered trainloads of weapons and ammunition to Russia including ballistic missiles and artillery rounds, Blinken said. 'The more Russia relies on their support, the more Iran and North Korea extract in return,' Blinken said. 'And the more Putin gives to Pyongyang and Tehran, the more he exacerbates threats to peace and security.' To those who ask how the United States and others can help Ukraine defend itself and criticize countries supplying military materiel to Russia, Blinken said the answer is simple: 'Russia is the aggressor, Ukraine is the victim.' ___ Edith M.

Trump praises Russia's military record in argument to stop fundin...	SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) — Donald Trump on Tuesday praised Russia's military record in historical conflicts and derided U.S. aid to Ukraine as he again insisted he would quickly end the war launched by Moscow's invasion if elected president. Speaking in Savannah, Georgia, Trump mocked President Joe Biden's frequent refrain that the U.S. would back the Ukrainian armed forces until Kyiv wins the war. He raised two long ago conflicts to suggest Moscow would not lose — the former Soviet Union's role in defeating Adolf Hitler and the Nazis in World War II in the 1940s, and French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte's failed invasion of Russia more than a century earlier. Trump insisted that the U.S. had 'to get out,' though he did not specify how he would negotiate an ending to U.S. involvement in the war. 'Biden says, ‘We will not leave until we win,’' Trump said, lowering his voice to mimic the Democratic president. 'What happens if they win? That’s what they do, is they fight wars. As somebody told me the other day, they beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon. That’s what they do. They fight. And it’s not pleasant.' An official on Trump's campaign also said Tuesday that the Republican nominee will not meet this week with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is visiting the U.S. to attend the opening of the U.N. General Assembly. No meeting had been scheduled between the two, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning, despite a statement from Ukrainian officials last week that said Zelenskyy had planned to see the former president. Trump on Tuesday repeated his characterization of Zelenskyy as 'the greatest salesman on Earth' for winning U.S. aid to help Ukraine. 'Every time Zelenskyy comes to the United States, he walks away with $100 billion,' Trump said, erroneously. The U.S. has provided more than $56 billion in security assistance since Russia invaded in 2022, according to the State Department. Trump and Zelenskyy have a long history dating back to the former U.S. president's time in the White House. The then-president pressured Zelenskyy to open investigations of Biden and his son Hunter as well as a cybersecurity firm Trump falsely linked to Ukraine. That call — and the hold placed by the White House on $400 million in military aid — led to Trump's first impeachment. Zelenskyy plans to meet with Biden and Harris in Washington. Earlier this week, in an interview with The New Yorker, Zelenskyy implied Trump does not understand and oversimplifies the conflict, and said his running mate JD Vance is 'too radical' and essentially advocates for Ukraine to 'make a sacrifice' by 'giving up its territories.' On Monday, Trump's son Donald Jr. criticized Zelenskyy on X, reminding his followers that the suspect in his father's second assassination attempt had lambasted Trump's approach to foreign policy, including the war in Ukraine. 'So a foreign leader who has received billions of dollars in funding from American taxpayers, comes to our country and has the nerve to attack the GOP ticket for President?' he posted. ___ Associated Press writer Michelle L.

Biden in farewell U.N. address says peace still possible in confl...	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — President Joe Biden declared in his final address to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday that the U.S. must not retreat from the world, as Israel and Hezbollah militants in Lebanon edged toward all-out war and Israel’s bloody operation against Hamas in Gaza neared the one-year mark. Biden used his wide-ranging address to speak to a need to end the Middle East conflict and the 17-month-old civil war in Sudan and to highlight U.S. and Western allies' support for Kyiv since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. He also raised concern over artificial intelligence and its potential to be used for repression. His appearance before the international body offered Biden one of his last high-profile opportunities as president to make the case to keep up robust support for Ukraine, which could be in doubt if former President Donald Trump defeats Vice President Kamala Harris in November. Biden insisted that despite global conflicts, he remains hopeful for the future. 'I’ve seen a remarkable sweep of history,' Biden said. 'I know many look at the world today and see difficulties and react with despair but I do not.' 'We are stronger than we think' when the world acts together, he added. Biden came to office promising to rejuvenate U.S. relations around the world and to extract the U.S. from 'forever wars' in Afghanistan and Iraq that consumed American foreign policy over the last 20 years. 'I was determined to end it, and I did,' Biden said of the Afghanistan exit, calling it a 'hard decision but the right decision.' He acknowledged that it was 'accompanied by tragedy' with the deaths of 13 American troops and hundreds of Afghans in a suicide bombing during the chaotic withdrawal. But his foreign policy legacy may ultimately be shaped by his administration's response to two of the biggest conflicts in Europe and the Middle East since World War II. 'There will always be forces that pull our countries apart,' Biden said, rejecting 'a desire to retreat from the world and go it alone.' He said, 'Our task, our test, is to make sure that the forces holding us together are stronger than the forces pulling us apart.' The Pentagon announced Monday that it was sending a small number of additional U.S. troops to the Middle East to supplement the roughly 40,000 already in the region. All the while, the White House insists Israel and Hezbollah still have time to step back and de-escalate. 'Full scale war is not in anyone’s interest,' Biden said, and despite escalating violence, a diplomatic solution is the only path to peace. Biden had a hopeful outlook for the Middle East when he addressed the U.N. just a year ago. In that speech, Biden spoke of a 'sustainable, integrated Middle East' coming into view. At the time, economic relations between Israel and some of its Arab neighbors were improving with implementation of the Abraham Accords that Israel signed with Bahrain, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates during the Trump administration. Biden's team helped resolve a long-running Israel-Lebanon maritime dispute that had held back gas exploration in the region. And Israel-Saudi normalization talks were progressing, a game-changing alignment for the region if a deal could be landed. 'I suffer from an oxymoron: Irish optimism,' Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when they met on the sidelines of last year's U.N. gathering. He added, 'If you and I, 10 years ago, were talking about normalization with Saudi Arabia ... I think we’d look at each other like, ‘Who’s been drinking what?’' Eighteen days later, Biden's Middle East hopes came crashing down. Hamas militants stormed into Israel killing 1,200, taking some 250 hostage, and spurring a bloody war that has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians in Gaza and led the region into a complicated downward spiral. Now, the conflict is threatening to metastasize into a multi-front war and leave a lasting scar on Biden's presidential legacy. Israel and Hezbollah traded strikes again Tuesday as the death toll from a massive Israeli bombardment climbed to nearly 560 people and thousands fled from southern Lebanon. It's the deadliest barrage since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. Israel has urged residents of southern Lebanon to evacuate from homes and other buildings where it claimed Hezbollah has stored weapons, saying the military would conduct 'extensive strikes' against the militant group. Hezbollah, meanwhile, has launched dozens of rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in retaliation for strikes last week that killed a top commander and dozens of fighters. Dozens were also killed last week and hundreds more wounded after hundreds of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah militants exploded, a sophisticated attack that was widely believed to have been carried out by Israel. Israel's leadership launched its counterattacks at a time of growing impatience with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah's persistent launching of missiles and drones across the Israel-Lebanon border after Hamas started the war with its brazen attack on Oct. 7. Biden reiterated his call on the parties to agree to a cease-fire and hostage release deal, saying it's time to 'end this war' — even as hopes for such a deal are fading as the conflict drags on. Biden, in his address, called for the sustainment of Western support for Ukraine in its war with Russia. Biden helped galvanize an international coalition to back Ukraine with weapons and economic aid in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's February 2022 assault on Ukraine. 'We cannot grow weary,' Biden said. 'We cannot look away.' Biden has managed to keep up American support in the face of rising skepticism from some Republican lawmakers — and Trump — about the cost of the conflict. At the same time, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is pressing Biden to loosen restrictions on the use of Western-supplied long-range missiles so that Ukrainian forces can hit deeper in Russia. So far Zelenskyy has not persuaded the Pentagon or White House to loosen those restrictions. The Defense Department has emphasized that Ukraine can already hit Moscow with Ukrainian-produced drones, and there is hesitation on the strategic implications of a U.S.-made missile potentially striking the Russian capital. Putin has warned that Russia would be 'at war' with the United States and its NATO allies if they allow Ukraine to use the long-range weapons. Biden and Harris are scheduled to hold separate meetings with Zelenskyy in Washington on Thursday. Ukrainian officials were also trying to arrange a meeting for Zelenskyy with Trump this week, though a Trump campaign official said it wasn't going to materialize. The president also sounded an alarm about the rapid advances in artificial intelligence development, particularly around disinformation, respect for human life and the potential exploitation by totalitarian powers. He told the world leaders, 'There may well be no greater test of our leadership than how we deal with A.I.' 'We must make certain that the awesome capabilities of A.I. will be used to uplift and empower everyday people, not to give dictators more powerful shackles on the human spirit,' he added. Later, he held a bilateral meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and joined other world leaders in an event highlighting their partnership to combat the production and distribution of synthetic opioids like fentanyl, which drive tens of thousands of deaths in the U.S. annually alone. Biden struck a wistful tone in his remarks, peppering his speech with references to his first time attending the General Assembly more than 50 years ago, and quoting Irish poetry. Biden held up his decision to step aside up as an instructive moment as he addressed a gathering that has no small share of totalitarian and nondemocratic leaders. 'Some things are more important than staying in power,' Biden said. 'It’s your people that matter the most. Never forget, we are here to serve the people. Not the other way around.' ___ Miller reported from Washington.

Irish president accuses Israel of leaking his letter to Iran	President of Ireland Michael D. Higgins has accused the Israeli Embassy in Dublin of circulating a letter he wrote to Iran's newly appointed president, sparking a diplomatic row. The Israeli Embassy has strongly denied the allegation, calling it 'baseless' and 'highly inflammatory.' The controversy began last month when Higgins' letter to Masoud Pezeshkian, following his appointment as President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, became public. Speaking at the United Nations (UN) in New York on Sunday, Higgins suggested that Israeli officials were behind the letter's circulation. 'You should ask where the criticism came from and how the letter was circulated and by whom and for what purpose,' Higgins told journalists. When pressed further, he stated, 'I believe it was circulated from the Israeli Embassy' in Dublin. Higgins defended his letter, explaining that it was customary to congratulate a new head of state and that there had been interest in restarting nuclear talks with Iran. In the letter, Higgins told Pezeshkian that Iran had a 'crucial role' in peace in the Middle East following the death of his predecessor, Ebrahim Raisi, in a helicopter crash in May. The letter, which appeared in the Jewish Chronicle, prompted criticism in both the UK and Ireland. It read in part, 'I regret of course the circumstances that brought about the election, and take the opportunity to repeat the condolences of the people of Ireland for the deaths of your predecessor President Raisi.' The Israeli Embassy in Dublin swiftly responded to Higgins' accusation, stating, 'This baseless accusation is highly inflammatory and potentially slanderous, and the embassy rejects it completely.' The embassy's statement added that it is the 'burden of the author to defend its content, which did not mention the threat Iran poses in the region.' Irish President Michael D. Higgins' leaked letter to President of the Islamic Republic of Iran (L) and the Iranian Embassy's post on the social media platform X. Screenshot: @DublinIran X The embassy also referenced the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, in which approximately 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 were taken hostage, with 101 still being held in Gaza. Simon Harris, the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) also present at the UN in New York, defended the Irish president. Harris stated that his primary concern was the loss of life in Gaza, asserting that Israel 'is continuing to allow a horrific humanitarian situation continue.' Harris further commented, 'I think the Israeli embassy should be focusing on things other than amplifying, circulating or referencing a letter that does really conform with normal diplomatic protocol between heads of state.' 'I have no interest whatsoever in getting into any sort of tit-for-tat or back-or-forth with the Israeli embassy or the government of a country that is continuing to allow this horrific humanitarian situation continue,' Harris added. However, screenshots proved that it was the Iranian Embassy itself who circulated the letter. Ireland is known for its critical stance towards Israel, yet among the widespread support the president received for his accusations against Israel, which were later proven false, one media report particularly stood out. One of the journalists covering the affair was Gavan Reilly, the political correspondent for Virgin Media News. In one of his reports on the incident, Reilly chose to say that 'the global Jewish lobby and organizations sympathetic to Israel' attacked the president for publishing a congratulatory letter to the incoming leader of the Islamic Republic. The use of conspiratorial terms like 'global Jewish lobby' caused great anger in the Jewish and Israeli community in Dublin. 'The report not only reeked of antisemitism and the oldest conspiracies in the world against Jews, it also showed us again that in Ireland of 2024, antisemitism is not only tolerated but welcomed with open arms on live broadcast,' said a source in the Irish Jewish community. 'We've reached a point where statements like 'global Jewish lobby' are made without any shame. It's often said that Ireland is the most critical country towards Israel and that this leads to antisemitism, but we're no longer sure if antisemitism is simply there and is what's leading Ireland to be the most critical country in Europe towards Israel.' Rabbi Yoni Wieder, chief rabbi of Ireland, expressed great disappointment with the conduct of the country's leaders and local media in the affair. 'The baseless accusations against the Israeli Embassy and the support from politicians and media figures in the country, who barely bothered to check the claim which is factually incorrect, reveal a disappointing and worrying trend. However, in light of what we've been experiencing and seeing here in recent months, unfortunately, it's no longer surprising.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/24/irish-president-accuses-israel-of-leaking-his-letter-to-iran/	2024-09-23T18:30:32-07:00	
Ukraine accuses Russia of seeking to illegally control strategic ...	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Ukraine on Monday accused Russia of seeking to illegally seize control of the strategically important Sea of Azov and Kerch Strait, as hearings opened in a high-stakes arbitration case between Kyiv and Moscow. The hearings at the Permanent Court of Arbitration are the latest in a string of international legal cases involving Russia and Ukraine linked to Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and its 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, even as fighting continues to rage on battlefields in Ukraine. 'Russia wants to take the Sea of Azov and Kerch Strait for itself, and so it has built a great gate at the entrance to keep international shipping out while allowing small Russian river vessels in,' Ukrainian representative Anton Korynevych told a panel of arbitrators. The gate he referred to is a bridge built by Russia across the Kerch Strait after the annexation of Crimea. The $3.5-billion, 19-kilometer (12-mile) bridge linking the Black and Azov seas carries road and rail traffic on separate sections and is vital to sustaining Russia’s military operations in southern Ukraine. 'The bridge is unlawful and it must come down,' Korynevych told the arbitration panel. Ukraine filed the case in 2016, two years after Russia annexed Crimea. It accuses Moscow of subsequently breaching a United Nations maritime treaty by building the bridge, barring Ukrainian fishermen from waters they traditionally fished, damaging the environment and plundering underwater archeological sites. Kyiv is seeking unspecified compensation. Russia insists the arbitration court does not have jurisdiction. It says that if its five judges decide they do have jurisdiction, the court should dismiss Ukraine's claims. 'Ukraine’s accusations in this case are, of course, completely groundless and hopeless,' Russian Agent Gennady Kuzmin told the panel. He argued that the Sea of Azov and Kerch Strait constitute 'internal waters' that are not covered by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the treaty Ukraine alleges Russia is breaching. After Monday's two opening statements, the panel hearings will continue for days behind closed doors. A final ruling could take years. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine:	https://wgntv.com/news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ap-ukraine-accuses-russia-of-seeking-to-illegally-control-strategic-sea-as-arbitration-hearings-open/	2024-09-23T02:51:13-07:00	
IDF assessment: Sinwar alive, using hostages as human shields	Security sources report that Yahya Sinwar – the top Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip – has been out of contact for some time, prompting an investigation into the cause of his silence. Current assessments indicate that Sinwar is alive and using hostages as human shields. However, authorities are exploring other scenarios, particularly given Israel's recent bombing campaign targeting tunnels in areas where Sinwar was believed to be hiding. Video: Yahyah Sinwar flees in the tunnel at the start of war / Credit: IDF At present, there is no evidence suggesting Sinwar is dead, apart from his prolonged silence. It's important to note that throughout the war, there have been substantial periods when Sinwar was incommunicado, either due to being on the move or deliberately choosing to cut off contact for strategic reasons.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/09/23/idf-intel-sinwar-alive-using-hostages-as-human-shields/	2024-09-22T20:00:06-07:00
