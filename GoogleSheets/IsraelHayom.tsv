Israel's US ambassador on Egyptian military buildup: 'Not tolerab...	Israel's ambassador to the US, Dr. Yechiel Leiter, has issued a stark warning about the growing military presence of the Egyptian army in the Sinai Peninsula, in violation of the Israel-Egypt peace treaty, marking the first time an Israeli official has spoken out on the matter. In a recent briefing to Jewish organization leaders in the US, Leiter described the situation as 'intolerable.' Speaking to the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, Leiter stated, 'This is an issue that will come up. Egypt is in a very serious violation of our peace agreement in the Sinai. This is an issue which is going to come to the fore, because this is not a tolerable situation.' The ambassador further warned, 'There are bases being built, and they can only be used for offensive operations and offensive weapons. This is a clear violation. For a long time, this issue has been shoved to the side, but it continues. This is a issue that we are going to put on the table – very soon and very emphatically.'

Israel has so far refused to comment on Egypt's overall military buildup, particularly the deployment of large military forces in Sinai, which contradicts the security annex of the peace treaty. Security and diplomatic sources confirmed that over the years, Egypt has repeatedly moved forces into Sinai in violation of the agreement, only to request retroactive approval from Israel, permission that was consistently granted by Netanyahu. Dr. Yagil Henkin, a military affairs expert who first warned about these troubling developments in 2018, explained, 'This happened through a process of creeping annexation. First, they deployed forces, then they sought retroactive Israeli approval, which was always granted. Even after the operational need ended, the forces were never withdrawn.'

It started with two battalions, and today there are tens of thousands of soldiers and dozens of tanks. Some are concentrated near Egyptian Rafah, while others are stationed near former ISIS strongholds in Sinai. The operational necessity to fight ISIS has passed, yet the forces remain. Additionally, Egypt has developed infrastructure, including bridges, roads, and large tunnels, enabling them to transfer entire divisions into Sinai within hours from the western side of the Suez Canal.' Members of the US Congress are aware of Egypt's violations and intend to bring the issue to the agenda. In an internal discussion among Republican lawmakers, a provision was raised stating, 'Egypt is substantially violating the Camp David Accords through the deployment of forces and movement of tanks into Sinai. This poses a strategic threat to Israel's southern border, and specifically falls under US responsibility as the agreement's guarantor.' The agenda item also calls for a review of US economic assistance to Egypt in light of its military presence in Sinai. 'American funding to Egypt must be reevaluated based on these agreements. Egypt must be presented with a timeline for withdrawing its forces from the peninsula,' the policy proposal states.

Hostage's mother: I replay our final conversation every night for...	For 500 days and nights I've missed my beloved firstborn son so much. I have tears in my eyes now when I hear that number. It's inhuman. I'm still stuck on October 7. I must replay, every night, our last conversation. My Edan called before 7 AM and spoke loudly because of the noise around him. I hear explosions in the background that won't stop, and Edan tells me: 'You won't believe what I'm seeing here – war. I took shrapnel to my helmet, but I'm okay.' And I, his mother, beg him: 'Edan, take care of yourself, protect yourself, I'm with you, I love you so much,'' Yael Alexander recounts. The call was cut off. Edan was taken captive to Gaza from a military post near Nirim kibbutz near the Gaza border. Yael says she was beside herself. 'You're just a shell, you're finished. We weren't human beings. I couldn't sleep or eat. Boom. Suddenly your child disappears. For five nerve-wracking days we didn't know day from night. We opened many operations rooms, until after several agonizing days they informed us Edan was captive in Gaza. An insane nightmare. But at least we knew he was alive and walking on his feet.' Yael Alexander with her son, Edan Alexander (Photo: Courtesy) 'It was like a knife in the heart' Since then, Yael, an artist, and her husband, Adi, a diamond dealer, who live in the US, haven't stopped for even a moment crisscrossing Washington and other American states. Edan has American citizenship, and his parents now dedicate their lives to fighting with all their might for his return from captivity – along with all the other hostages. They leave their occupations for days each week for the struggle. Last Friday afternoon, Yael arrived in Israel just as the names of three more released hostages were announced. By Saturday evening she was already at the Hostages Square, raising Edan's photo on stage. 'I admit it was difficult for me. This is my first time in Israel during a release. The TV images of what Hamas is doing simply hurt my stomach. They're stressful.' As part of their heroic struggle, Yael and Adi met with, among others, President Donald Trump ('he's very committed to the hostages'), as well as administration officials and other figures. They conduct interviews and work tirelessly to influence and bring back their captive son. 'It's not Jewish, not ethical, and not moral not to support getting all the hostages out immediately, and now,' says Yael, 'certainly not to support stage two of the deal, during which our Edan is finally supposed to leave this terrible captivity.' 'We saw the latest returnees, and for me, it was like a knife in the heart. On one hand, I was happy for the families, and on the other hand, it wasn't simple to see them. Edan fought to be in the army. Why, why aren't they fighting for him now in return? I cry out – give me back my son already! Bring all the hostages home!' 'He wouldn't give up serving in the IDF' Edan is their firstborn son. When he was just two and a half months old, Yael (45) and Adi (52) moved to the US, and from age 4 Edan grew up in New Jersey. He has a sister, Mika (18), and a brother, Roy (13), who recently celebrated his bar mitzvah without his brother. Edan Alexander with his family (Photo: Courtesy) A warm, united, enveloping, and loving family. Yael speaks with sparkling eyes about her Edan: a child full of joy, charismatic, who always knew how to unite his many friends around him. She gets emotional talking about him, her voice cracking from time to time. 'Our Edan was always super social, super family-oriented. A talented and beloved child, always smiling, someone who really loved life. We were always very, very close. Edan and I loved to travel together for a day of fun in New York. We had deep, moving conversations. He's the funniest person in the world. Hilarious. He devoured life. How much I love this child.' After finishing high school in the US, while his many friends went to study in college, Edan refused to give up on military service in Israel. 'It wasn't simple for us at first,' Yael recalls, 'but Edan was very determined. He was in the Garin Tzabar program here in New York and made aliyah in August 2022. A young man, my precious boy. It was hard for him at first with the distance from home, and for us, too. We missed him very much. Fortunately, I have a very large family in Israel who embraced him, and we also came to Israel a lot and were with him. He, for his part, made sure to come visit us.' In Israel, Edan lived in Kibbutz Hatzor, where 'He has a wonderful adoptive family,' according to Yael. He enlisted in the Golani Brigade in mid-December 2022 as a lone soldier. He frequently visited his grandparents, as well as other family members. Two months before Black Saturday, Edan traveled to visit his family in the US. Yael surprised him when she decided to come to Israel a month and a half later to meet him and her family here. 'I arrived in Israel on September 31, 2023, and Edan and I spent a lot of time together. All the time. With my family in Tel Aviv, with grandmother, Varda, and grandfather, Baruch, with my siblings. We went on an art tour, ate malabi, the dessert he loves so much. And we kept hanging out. That's what Edan is like, full of vitality and energy. We were at the beach, and then went to eat hamburgers. He was happy.' 'He feels us from afar' To Yael's regret, Edan had to return to his base near Nirim. She still managed to drive him to Hatzor, they even took photos in the car and at the entrance to his home in the kibbutz. She didn't know these would be her last pictures with him until he returns from captivity. Yael Alexander with her son, Edan Alexander (Photo: Courtesy) 'On the evening of Simchat Torah, on Friday, the day before October 7, Edan was with us for Kiddush on FaceTime. A handsome boy. There was a wonderful atmosphere. We agreed to talk the next morning. Who knew our next conversation would already be during a terrible war. Our lives turned upside down. It tears my heart apart. Makes me cry so much.' 'My son had a sweet life in the US, and he chose to be somewhere else, in Israel. What kind of terrible reality is this? I want them to bring him back to us already. What happened to us? What kind of leadership do we have? Where is the right, just judgment? I say to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, 'Think for just one moment what would happen if this was your son.'' Yael says she must also take care of her two other children, to be strong for them too. She admits that often they are the ones strengthening her. She tells how Mika has already spoken several times at massive rallies across the US for the hostages ('in front of 600,000 people in the crowd'). 'They're amazing, my children. They were unwillingly enlisted in the struggle, in the war to bring their brother back from Gaza. Edan was supposed to come to Roy's bar mitzvah celebration, six months after the day he was kidnapped. That obviously didn't happen. We all went to the event wearing shirts with Edan's picture and the call to bring him home now. Mika and Roy miss their brother very much, they're both very close to him. Like us, they don't stop working toward the goal of his return to them.' Edan Alexander's family with President Donald Trump and Republican commentator Ben Shapiro (Photo: Courtesy) Yael also tells about the proof of life she received from her son, after 421 days in captivity. 'I was in Israel at the time. I suddenly heard they were going to release a video of Edan, our son, and the ground fell out from under me. I couldn't stop crying. It was shattering. Edan appeared in the video pale and thinner, didn't look like our Edan. I was overcome with a range of emotions. On one hand, it was important proof of life for us. Look, Edan is alive. But this is your child, and you see him in such a state. I just wanted to hug him already. I'm an optimistic person, and I want to see good things. My son is strong, and I know he can survive this. I believe he feels us from afar. Since the video we haven't received any additional proof of life from him, and I repeat our request again: get him out of there already!' She tells again and again that her heart is 'constantly torn' and seeking solace. What does a mother hold onto, 500 days without her beloved son? 'I'm eagerly waiting for my meeting with Edan,' says the lioness mother, who has come to Israel again to fight for his release. 'I just want to sit next to him. He has very comforting shoulders. I'll put my head on his shoulder and tell him 'how wonderful, how wonderful that we're together again.' I don't know what he'll want when he's with us again. Maybe he'll say he's craving Thai food. Maybe sushi. I just want to reach that moment already – when our Edan will sit with us at home.'

British Muslim calls for Israel's destruction – while in Israel	A Muslim tourist from Britain who visited Israel documented his trip in a series of videos where he explicitly called for the state's destruction, labeled IDF soldiers as 'baby killers' and displayed overt hostility toward Israel. The incident occurred just one month after a terrorist, who had entered the country under the guise of being a tourist, perpetrated a stabbing attack in Tel Aviv. Video: Muslim British tourist documentes his trip in a series of videos where he explicitly called for the state's destruction.

After landing, he ridiculed the Israeli presence at Ben Gurion International Airport and described the state's flags as 'filthy.' His rhetoric intensified during a visit to the Temple Mount, where he explicitly called for Israel's destruction, asserting this was the sole solution to ensure freedom of worship at the al-Aqsa mosque. The emergence of these videos comes approximately one month after the Tel Aviv attack, perpetrated by a terrorist who gained entry to Israel as a tourist, despite raising suspicions during border checks. In response to these recent events, Israel's National Security Minister has instructed the Shin Bet to review procedures and draw conclusions.

Bibi you do whatever you want': Trump doubles down on hostages	President Donald Trump told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to 'do whatever you want' regarding Gaza operations, CBS News reported Sunday, as the Israeli leader praised Trump's 'bold vision' for the region's future and accepted a major US weapons delivery previously blocked by the Biden administration. In a joint appearance with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Jerusalem, Netanyahu said Israel and the United States share a 'common strategy' regarding Gaza. 'We can't always share the details of this strategy with the public, including when the gates of hell will be opened, as they surely will if all our hostages are not released until the last one,' Netanyahu said, according to CBS News. Rubio, speaking to CBS News 'Face the Nation' moderator Margaret Brennan after meeting Netanyahu, emphasized ongoing efforts to secure the hostages' release. 'Obviously, there are details of how we're pursuing that and coordinating that we're not going to share publicly because we don't want to endanger the hostages and we don't want to endanger this process,' Rubio said. The statements came as the first phase of the ceasefire between Israel and Gaza approaches its end in two weeks. The second phase, involving the release of remaining hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and Israeli force withdrawal, remains under negotiation. President Donald Trump rides in the presidential limousine known as 'The Beast' as he takes a pace lap ahead of the start of the NASCAR Daytona 500 auto race at Daytona International Speedway, Sunday, Feb. 16, 2025, in Daytona Beach, Fla. (Pool via AP) Netanyahu welcomed Trump's recent proposal for Gaza's future, praising the 'unequivocal support' from the US. Rubio acknowledged that Trump's vision to transform the Gaza Strip into a 'Riviera of the Middle East' had surprised many observers. 'The president's also been very bold about his view of what the future for Gaza should be, not the same tired ideas of the past, but something that's bold and something that, frankly, took courage and vision,' Rubio said, according to CBS News. Trump, speaking to reporters at the Daytona 500, commented on his discussions with Netanyahu: 'I told Bibi you do whatever you want. Because my statement was, they got to comeback.' The former president noted that recently released hostages appeared to be in 'pretty good shape.' Tensions escalated Sunday when the Israeli military conducted an airstrike in southern Gaza. The Hamas-run Interior Ministry reported three police officers were killed while securing aid truck entry near Rafah. Hamas called the attack a 'serious violation' of the ceasefire and accused Netanyahu of attempting to undermine the agreement. The conflict began after Hamas's October 7 attack, which killed 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 hostages. On Saturday, Israel received a shipment of MK-84 heavy bombs after Trump lifted restrictions previously imposed by the Biden administration, CBS News reported. When asked about the weapons delivery, Trump emphasized, 'Peace through strength. You understand that, right? It's called peace through strength.' During their meeting, Netanyahu and Rubio also addressed concerns about Iran, with both officials emphasizing the need to prevent Iranian nuclear weapons development and counter regional aggression. Netanyahu highlighted Israel's recent actions against Iran since the Gaza war began, expressing confidence in completing 'the job' with Trump's support.

Report: This is Egypt's plan for Gaza reconstruction	The Qatari Al-Araby Al-Jadeed reported Saturday morning that Egypt's plan for Gaza's reconstruction is centered on forming a Palestinian committee overseen by the Palestinian Authority, excluding Hamas from the process. According to Egyptian sources, this committee is expected to take responsibility for Gaza's reconstruction as part of the proposed framework. Additionally, Egyptian and other companies will undertake reconstruction projects under the plan, while Arab or international forces may be involved in securing their operations. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Photo: AFP However, the Qatari report noted that Israel has expressed opposition to these proposals during discussions with Egypt and remains committed to alternative options. Egyptian sources added that the presence of Arab or international forces in Gaza is a particularly sensitive issue, as some countries refuse to engage in direct military involvement. Any force that intervenes in Gaza could face internal resistance. The report also highlighted concerns that the reconstruction and rebuilding process could create tensions with Gaza-based terrorist organizations due to the presence of tunnels and other infrastructure used by these groups.

Photo: Reuters A senior Arab diplomatic source told the Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat that there is ongoing coordination among Arab states to formulate a comprehensive response to Trump's plan for Gaza. According to the source, Arab leaders are expected to meet to discuss the details before presenting their proposal at an emergency summit in Cairo at the end of the month. Meanwhile, a Reuters report suggested that Arab proposals may include a 'reconstruction fund' and an agreement to sideline Hamas. Sources indicated that at least four proposals have been drafted regarding Gaza's future, though it appears that Egypt's plan is currently the leading framework.

Houthi leader: In the event of escalation we will attack Israel, ...	Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, the leader of the Houthi Yemeni terrorist organization, stated today (Thursday) in a speech that 'Israel is clearly evading the second phase of the deal, and Netanyahu has announced his intention to extend the first phase. He wants to take from the Palestinians what is included in the second phase, forcing them to release the remaining hostages in the first phase, while he does not fulfill his commitments.' He added, 'Trump has aggressively threatened the Palestinians and the resistance if all the hostages are not released by Saturday. He promises them hell and threatens them. He even denies the agreement he himself guaranteed to implement. The agreement has clear language, specific phases, and certain steps. Trump's position is a deviation from all international norms. It is a deception, a lie, and the use of tyrannical language and threats.' The Houthis. Photo: EPA/Yahya Arhab Following this, the Houthi leader warned: 'If the US and Israel move towards escalation, it means the region will enter into a big problem. There will be consequences for the security of the region. We will immediately take military action if Americans and Israelis, based on Trump's threat, move towards aggression against Gaza. We will not hesitate to attack both Israel and the US together. We are monitoring the implementation of the agreement. When we see a violation of the agreement and new escalation against the Palestinians, along with widespread aggression against them, we will intervene militarily as we did to support them.'

Israeli strike on Iran 'within the next six months'	Israel is expected to strike Iran's nuclear facilities, according to senior officials in the US intelligence community, as reported Thursday morning by The Washington Post. US intelligence sources who spoke with the newspaper claimed that Israel is likely to target Iran's nuclear program sites in Fordow or Natanz. They added that an Israeli strike could set back Iran's progress toward developing nuclear weapons by weeks or even months. The next target? Iran's nuclear facility (Archive).

Officials believe there is a possibility of persuading the incoming Trump administration to join the operation.

Hamas signals willingness to proceed with hostage deal	The delicate negotiations surrounding the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release agreement showed signs of progress Thursday, as mediators worked intensively to prevent the deal's collapse just 48 hours before Saturday's crucial deadline. Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar reported Thursday morning that talks between Hamas delegates and Egyptian intelligence officials in Cairo had yielded positive results, with sources indicating agreement on key issues that could enable the continuation of hostage releases while ensuring Israeli compliance with humanitarian commitments. The development comes at a critical juncture, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu scheduled to conduct a situational assessment at the Israeli Defense Forces' Southern Command amid growing tensions over the deal's implementation. According to Palestinian sources familiar with the negotiations, mediators have secured an initial Israeli commitment to fulfill humanitarian obligations, including the entry of essential supplies and equipment into Gaza.

Meanwhile, Saudi media reported that mediators have urged all parties to avoid provocations that could jeopardize the agreement's progress. The Qatari channel Al-Araby confirmed Thursday that trucks carrying tents had begun entering northern Gaza through the Zikim crossing, marking a tangible step in the humanitarian aspects of the agreement. Egyptian officials have reportedly rejected any forced displacement plans for Gaza residents and expressed commitment to the territory's reconstruction, according to sources familiar with the discussions. Cairo has also emphasized the importance of maintaining regular medical evacuations and ensuring the agreed-upon volume of aid deliveries continues to reach the enclave.

Egypt increases Sinai military presence, violates peace treaty	Attempts to smuggle weapons using drones, satellite images indicating changes in the Egyptian military's force deployment in Sinai, and concerned security coordinators in Israeli border communities all paint a concerning picture regarding developments in Egypt. Israeli political and security officials state that Egypt's shifting military presence in Sinai is closely monitored and periodically approved by the prime minister. However, sources familiar with Israel-Egypt relations acknowledge that such approvals are always given retroactively, after Egypt has already turned these violations of the Israel-Egypt peace treaty into routine occurrences. A source with knowledge of the situation told Israel Hayom: 'The images from Egypt raised concerns, prompting us to conduct checks with Military Intelligence and the Southern IDF Command. Indeed, there are violations, but surprisingly, the situation is better than it was in the past.' Soldiers stationed near the border note that, given it is a peaceful border, any action is taken with caution, with primary attention focused on the smuggling routes between Sinai and the Bedouins. The border with Egypt has become a major smuggling route (Archive). Photo: IDF Spokesperson The IDF recently acknowledged the smuggling of long-range weapons into Israel via drones. Israeli assessments indicate that these weapons previously made their way from Sinai to Gaza. However, with the IDF now deployed along the Philadelphi Corridor, a new client has emerged, the Bedouins, who in turn transfer the weapons to criminal organizations and the West Bank. On the Israeli side, smugglers wait on fast-moving ATVs and disappear within seconds. Since this is a relatively new smuggling route, Israeli authorities are still working to track where the weapons are being funneled, accumulating knowledge as they go. Concern over Egyptian military buildup Former Deputy Ambassador to Egypt and researcher at the Misgav Institute, Ruth Wasserman Lande, has also voiced concern over the developments and statements emerging from Egypt. 'Over a year ago, on October 8, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi made unusually harsh statements, saying that if Israel approached southern Gaza, it would be grounds for war. I said back then that this does not bode well. This is very serious, and I wouldn't dismiss it lightly. Over time, it has become evident that there is a significant increase in Egyptian military presence in the Sinai Peninsula, far beyond even the previous violations of the peace treaty that we had reluctantly accepted.' Wasserman Lande warns: 'Not only are we allowing the buildup of forces on the other side, but we are also permitting it without receiving anything in return, in a way that does not align with the diplomatic language of the Middle East.' In recent days, Egyptian rhetoric has also touched on concerns over the potential implementation of former US President Donald Trump's peace plan. El-Sisi has made it clear in no uncertain terms that he will not allow it to happen, even postponing a planned visit to the White House as a declarative move. 'This was also what initially worried the Egyptians at the start of the war,' Wasserman Lande explained. 'They view this as a potential cause for war. They understand that Hamas embeds itself within the civilian population, and they do not want that scenario spilling over into Egypt. They reacted strongly when Israel was about to enter Rafah. While they ultimately did not launch a war, they have begun acting as though they are preparing for one.' Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Photo: AFP Regarding the likelihood of a conflict, Wasserman Lande says that war requires both capability and willingness: 'Egypt has the capability, the roads, bridges, tunnels, and fuel. Their reference scenario is Israel. The question is about their willingness. It may seem irrational because they know that Israel is militarily superior, especially now with strong US support. However, there is a difference between willingness and motivation. Motivation can override rational considerations. This is where we often misread our adversaries, just as we underestimated Hamas' readiness to act. There are things more important to them than life itself, what we see as logical, they see as national honor.' She concludes, 'I believe there are those monitoring this situation closely, but given the multiple fronts, the pressure on the system, and Israel's internal challenges, not enough attention is being paid to this possibility.' On the other hand, a former Israeli ambassador to Egypt interprets the situation differently: 'I sense a wave of anti-Egyptian sentiment, likely fueled by anger over Egypt not opening its borders, something some Israelis assumed would happen. There are several actors, not necessarily official ones, who seem intent on spreading reports of Egypt's military buildup in Sinai. Back in 2011, when Egypt was shaken by the Muslim Brotherhood revolution and the country faced extreme instability, ISIS and al-Qaeda elements entrenched in Sinai carried out terror attacks that severely undermined Egypt's national security and led to the deaths of many soldiers.' 'Egypt turned to Israel, and we allowed them exceptional military deployments. There is a long-standing military coordination mechanism in place. It may be necessary to scrutinize these exceptions more closely, but that is the responsibility of Israel's intelligence agencies, not the media. The media noise surrounding this issue is unhelpful and only fosters mutual hostility. A designated international force, the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO), is specifically tasked with overseeing Sinai's demilitarization, and vast sums are allocated for its maintenance. Egypt lost valuable time over the past decade due to political upheaval, and now they are trying to compensate for it by focusing on national development. Would a war with Israel serve that goal? Certainly not.' Satellite images reveal tanks in Sinai Lt. Col. (res.) Eliyahu Dekel, who has monitored Egypt's adherence to the peace agreement since his military service immediately after the treaty was signed, continues to track the situation today. His website is filled with data and charts documenting these violations. Commenting on recent images from Egypt showing Abrams tanks in Sinai, he states: 'The presence of tanks near Israel's border is a blatant violation of the peace agreement, which stipulates that most of Sinai should remain demilitarized.' Israel-Egypt border (Archive). Photo: AFP According to Dekel, 'There is indisputable satellite evidence showing 100 tanks in El-Arish even before the war. These tanks are entirely prohibited in the area. Violations have been ongoing for decades. Initially, there were supposed to be 22,000 soldiers in the western part of Sinai, but now the agreement has been completely eroded, with four times that number permanently stationed there.' He adds, 'Sinai is supposed to be free of all military forces. If the latest images are verified, the concern isn't just about forces in Sinai, the key issue is the type of tanks. The images show Abrams tanks, which are Egypt's premier battle tanks, reserved for elite units. The peace treaty allows for division-level tanks, so the question arises: What are these special forces doing in Sinai? In recent years, three new airfields have been built in Sinai, and massive tunnels have been dug, blatantly violating the peace treaty. The treaty allows for military camps for 47 battalions, currently, there are camps for 180 battalions, four times the permitted amount. These are ongoing processes.' The IDF Spokesperson's Unit responded: 'IDF forces are deployed along the border to protect Israeli communities and are actively fulfilling that mission. During the war, defensive efforts were reinforced, and rules of engagement were adjusted to allow soldiers to respond effectively and offensively to any threat along the western border. The public is regularly updated on developments across all sectors, in accordance with censorship and operational security considerations. The IDF continues to operate in line with security needs while respecting the peace agreement.'

Israeli security forces on high alert amid concerns of Hamas atta...	Israel's defense and security apparatus is preparing for potential Hamas attacks from Gaza that could break the ceasefire. Military preparations are clearly visible, with forces being reinforced along the Gaza border region and planned tree-planting events in celebration of the holiday of Tu B'Shevat in border communities being canceled. A senior security source told Israel Hayom this morning: 'We're not playing 'chicken,' but preparing with utmost seriousness for threats and returning to combat according to political directives. Hamas created the current crisis with various pretexts of Israeli violations that never existed. We're preparing for all scenarios.' Israel expects the deal to continue while preparing for renewed warfare, this time without restraints: An Israeli source familiar with Cabinet discussions said Israel has support from President Donald Trump to resume fighting if Hamas doesn't uphold the agreement. According to the source, this time the war will look different, similar to the first months after Oct. 7, with renewed weapons shipments, no commitment to humanitarian aid, and complete American backing in the UN Security Council. During the cabinet discussion, ministers expressed complete support for Trump's statement regarding the equation on the table – return of hostages or renewed warfare as soon as this Saturday.

Photo credit: Eyad Baba/AFP Regarding negotiations for phase two, Israeli officials clarified: No talks will be held on the second phase without ensuring Hamas intends to complete the current phase. An Israeli source said Israel wants to receive more than three hostages this Saturday and insists all releases must occur by Saturday at 12 p.m. If and when phase two talks resume, Israel maintains that ending the war can only include one possible outcome: release of all hostages and Hamas no longer remaining as a governing or military force in Gaza. The cabinet will shape this mandate after Hamas signals it's ready to return to implementing the agreement. Additionally, the Defense Minister warns entities against smuggling in humanitarian aid to Gaza: 'Those found involved in smuggling may be included in economic sanctions lists and subject to strict financial restrictions.' An Israeli Air Force aircraft earlier today struck a drone and two suspects in southern Gaza, according to an Israel Defense Forces spokesperson. The military noted the drone was identified crossing from Israel to southern Gaza and was tracked until the strike. They added that several recent attempts to smuggle weapons into Gaza using drones have been identified. Earlier, Arab networks reported that an IDF drone struck east of Rafah, resulting in one death and one injury. According to assessments, these were two operatives attempting to launch a drone. Meanwhile, Al-Arabiya reported that the IDF continues strikes in the al-Sultan neighborhood in western Rafah, and that 'the Israeli military is destroying residential buildings' in the area.

Study finds Hamas starved hostages despite ample Gaza aid	An Israeli study analyzing food quantities entering Gaza as humanitarian aid has found that sufficient amounts of diverse food with adequate caloric content were delivered during most months of the war. The food met most international humanitarian standards, despite complex challenges on the ground. This underscores that Gaza had no food shortage, highlighting that hostages are being deliberately starved. The research, published in the scientific journal of the 'Israel National Institute For Health Policy Research,' examined aid volume from January 2024, approximately two months after the ground operation began, until July 2024. Senior officials from the Ministry of Health, Ben-Gurion University, Hebrew University, and the University of Haifa conducted the study. Additionally, researchers analyzed data from the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories regarding all food shipments transferred to Gaza through land crossings and airdrops. The findings show that during the examined period, approximately 478,229 tons of food were transferred to Gaza, after adjusting for expected food loss. Consequently, each Gaza resident received an average supply of about 3,000 calories per day. Protein quantity stood at 98 grams daily (13% of total energy), fat consumption reached 61 grams daily (18% of total energy), and iron supply was 23 mg per day. The study also found that food transferred to Gaza contained all nutritional components, except iron, in quantities exceeding the World Health Organization's standard for minimum food requirements for populations in crisis. Additionally, a consistent upward trend was observed in food quantities transferred to Gaza, except for a decrease in February compared to January.

Photo credit: Bashar Taleb/AFP 'Claims are incorrect' However, researchers emphasize they lack reliable data regarding actual food accessibility to residents and its consumption on the ground. 'The data shows that sufficient quantities of nutritious food were transferred to Gaza during most of the first half of 2024,' the researchers noted. 'However, increased cooperation between all involved parties is needed to overcome barriers and improve communication and information sharing.' The research provides a comprehensive snapshot of the food supply to Gaza during the examined period, emphasizing the importance of continued monitoring and assessment of the nutritional situation in the region. The findings may assist in better planning future humanitarian aid efforts. Professor Ronit Endevelt, nutritionist at the University of Haifa School of Public Health and former director of the Ministry of Health's Nutrition Department, who co-authored the study, stated: 'In most months when humanitarian aid was transferred, the quantity and quality of food entering was reasonable to good, meaning if the population didn't receive food, it's because distribution wasn't equitable by those controlling the territory, meaning Hamas. Hamas terrorists ride on top of a humanitarian aid truck in Rafah, Gaza Strip, Dec. 19, 2023. Photo credit: AP 'Claims echoing worldwide about insufficient food in Gaza are incorrect. Hamas had the ability to adequately feed the hostages yet consciously chose to starve them. This is beyond other shocking physical and mental torture, such as various restraints, lack of exposure to sunlight and daylight, inability to move – causing life-threatening malnutrition, damage to skeletal systems, immune system, hormonal system, and internal organs to the point of death risk. 'Israel, unlike other nations at war that don't feed the enemy, didn't prevent humanitarian aid to the civilian population,' Endevelt emphasized. 'Ultimately, Hamas seized control of much aid, profited from it, and thus accumulated funding for activities.'

Released hostages confirm Matan Angrest still alive in Gaza	In a significant development offering both hope and heartache, the family of captured Israel Defense Forces soldier Matan Angrest has received confirmation their son remains alive, through testimonies from recently released hostages who shared captivity with him. This crucial update comes approximately 500 days after Angrest was taken from his tank position at Kibbutz Nahal-Oz. The first tangible proof of Angrest's survival emerged in September 2024, when an audio recording was played during a gathering at the Hostages Square. In the recording, Angrest made a direct, emotional appeal to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, pleading for rescue from captivity. His mother, Anat Angrest, speaking on Channel 12, revealed that recent testimonies from released hostages have provided crucial confirmation of her son's survival. 'We are living in constant anxiety over the government's handling of this situation,' she said. 'While we have received confirmation that Matan is alive, he is being held in extremely harsh conditions. We know he was captured while serving in his IDF uniform.' She specifically referenced testimony from Or Levy, another hostage, describing the captors' emphasis on Levy's military status and the severe interrogations he endured. Anat Angrest, mother of Matan Angrest, who is being held hostage in Gaza (Photo: Yehoshua Yosef) 'My son's name appeared on the humanitarian list of wounded Israelis,' Anat Angrest explained, 'despite the prime minister's assertion that wounds aren't categorized. My son was wounded while defending our tank position at the border. He was unconscious when captured while protecting our nation's borders.' The mother voiced increasing frustration with the government's response: 'The state isn't even discussing how or when they will bring him home. Every mother in Israel needs to understand the reality of our situation. We know he suffered severe injuries, emerged from the tank with burns, and endured harsh interrogations. We've seen evidence of this on his face in footage we haven't yet released. We remain uncertain about the long-term implications of his injuries or whether they can be fully treated. Israel effectively abandoned him there from the moment of his capture. Please, just bring my child home.' In the September 2024 proof of life video, Matan Angrest addressed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with a direct appeal: 'Netanyahu, I desperately want to see my family and friends. This is crucial. I believe you're capable of this – you just need to want it. I trust you. You can do this, and I hope it happens soon.' Following the release of that first proof of life, Anat Angrest shared the painful experience of seeing her son: 'I received proof that Matan is alive through a video found by IDF forces in Gaza. In it, he says, 'Netanyahu, I don't understand how this happened, but I trust you to get me out of here.'' She concluded with words that cut to the heart of her family's ongoing nightmare: 'How disappointing that the prime minister hasn't extracted you yet, that you weren't discussed in the first phase of releases and aren't being discussed in the next. You're not a child, not a woman, not elderly, not chronically ill – just a soldier who fought, who was willing to sacrifice himself, and now you remain there, in tunnels in darkness, wounded and bleeding, who knows if surviving.'

Eldest Hamas hostage confirmed killed on Oct. 7	Shlomo Mantzur, 86, the eldest hostage in Hamas captivity, was expected to be released in the first phase of the hostage deal. However, the Israeli Defense Forces declared today that he was murdered on Oct. 7, 2023, and his body has been held by Hamas in Gaza ever since. 'With heavy hearts, we received the news this morning of the murder of our dear friend, Shlomo Mantzur, aged 86, who was kidnapped from his home in Kibbutz Kisufim during the Hamas terror attack on Oct. 7, 2023,' the kibbutz statement read. The Mantzur family stated: 'We received the devastating news from IDF representatives about the murder of our beloved and cherished Shlomo. He was the cornerstone of our entire family. A man of high moral values and principles, a humanitarian who always helped others wholeheartedly. We call on decision-makers to make a brave and principled decision to bring all hostages home immediately – the living for rehabilitation and the deceased for proper burial in their homeland.' The Oct. 7 kidnapping Shlomo Mantzur would have celebrated his 87th birthday this March. For over 70 years, Mantzur lived in Kibbutz Kisufim in southern Israel. It was his home, his safe haven – but on that Saturday, he was abducted from his house as his wife Mazal watched him being dragged away by terrorists.

Photo credit: Courtesy of Bring Them Home Now via REUTERS Hamas terrorists bound him, beat him, and took him by car to Gaza. The terrorists who infiltrated Kibbutz Kisufim murdered at least 12 of his fellow kibbutz members and six Thai workers. On his previous birthday, his nieces Naama and Hadar Cohen said: 'Close your eyes and imagine your grandfather sitting in Hamas tunnels, freezing with only an undershirt on his body, eating a quarter of a pita bread per day, thinking he's been forgotten. Our hearts break and there are no words to describe it.' The mustache that became his trademark, and the grandchildren who waited for grandpa Shlomo and Mazal have five children and 12 grandchildren. Relatives described him as a peace-loving man, caring, sensitive, honest, and kindhearted. His mustache became one of his trademarks, and a family member summed it up: 'I love and miss the tickling kiss with the mustache. I appeal to the world – help us bring back Shlomo and all the hostages with him.' Last Hanukkah, his family and community lit candles in a menorah he had built years ago. His daughter Batya said: 'We haven't celebrated holidays for a long time; for us, there are no holidays. But Hanukkah is a holiday of miracles, wishes, and prayers, so we observe the holiday's commandments hoping our wishes might come true. Hanukkah is a holiday of miracles, but I expect decision-makers not to wait for miracles.' Sister of Israeli hostage Shlomo Mantzur at the Hostages Square in Tel Aviv, Israel, on February 1, 2025. Photo credit: Gideon Markowicz Speaking about attempting to rebuild their lives, she shared: 'Since Oct. 7, we've moved between several residences, trying to build new lives – but you can't build new lives without a father. We're in a state of waiting.' The horrors he experienced as a child and the demand to embrace him again As a child, Shlomo Mantzur survived the Farhud riots in Iraq. His niece previously recounted: 'He witnessed with his own eyes the abuse of Muslim rioters against his family and acquaintances. Horrors that the mind refuses to process and the hand refuses to write. He immigrated to Israel convinced that no harm would come to him. He initially lived in a shack, and at age 15 arrived at Kibbutz Kisufim, believing the state would do everything to protect him.' His daughter Batya said: 'It's not real until we see it happen. There might be a bit more hope, but the fear doesn't disappear; on the contrary, it's much greater because there's also the fear of disappointment, as we've seen what happened before. Dad should have been home long ago.'

Trump to Jordan, Egypt: Back Gaza plan or lose aid	President Donald Trump escalated diplomatic tensions Tuesday by suggesting he might cut US aid to Jordan and Egypt if they reject his proposed Gaza development strategy, ABC News reported. Trump hosted Jordan's King Abdullah at the White House – marking the first visit by an Arab leader since Trump returned to office last month. When asked about securing the king's support for his Palestinian plan, Trump called Abdullah 'a good man.' The president's ambitious proposal envisions relocating close to 2 million Palestinians from Gaza to create what he describes as 'the Riviera of the Middle East.' Despite Jordan already hosting millions of registered Palestinian refugees, the Jordanian royal court stated on X: 'His Majesty King Abdullah II stresses the need to put a stop to settlement expansion, expressing rejection of any attempts to annex land and displace the Palestinians.'

'If they don't agree, I would conceivably withhold aid,' Trump told reporters Monday night. When asked if Palestinians could return after reconstruction, Trump answered in a Fox News interview aired Monday, 'No, they wouldn't, because they're going to have much better housing. I'm talking about building a permanent place for them.' Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to visit Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia this week. During recent Central America meetings, Rubio suggested Gazans would need alternative housing 'in the interim' when questioned about their return.

Uncertainty over Gaza pushs many back to displacement camps	The Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center estimates that uncertainty regarding the duration of Gaza's reconstruction, particularly in the northern part of the Strip, is expected to increase frustration among residents. Many are likely to return to displacement camps in the southern part of the Strip, where basic infrastructure for survival exists and humanitarian aid is consistently supplied. The research center noted that in light of President Donald Trump's proposal to make Gaza's residents leave, either temporarily or permanently, the devastation may prompt young Gazans to consider leaving for foreign countries in the hope of building a better future. The report's authors assessed that Hamas will attempt to suppress critical voices by force. However, given the widespread public frustration and the extensive destruction in Gaza, it will be difficult for the terrorist organization to maintain its 'victory' narrative without presenting concrete solutions for residents. Hamas may try to shift responsibility to another entity, such as the Gaza governance committee that Egypt is working to promote, while striving to preserve its military power. The report also provided data on movement toward northern Gaza. According to monitoring of movement from southern to northern Gaza, 545,355 people crossed the Netzarim Corridor between January 30 and February 3, 2025. Of those, 62% moved independently, while 38% were families. Among the returnees, 66% headed to northern Gaza, while 34% went to Gaza City. Additionally, 36,620 people crossed southward through the Netzarim Corridor between January 27 and February 3, 2025, according to data from ReliefWeb. Gaza. Photo: Reuters The report highlighted testimonies from Palestinians who returned to northern Gaza and vowed never to leave again. One such case was Wasim Al-Za'im, who was interviewed by the Palestinian newspaper Al-Ayyam. He expressed deep regret for having fled northern Gaza at the start of the war, saying he would never repeat the experience, even if it meant facing death for himself and his family. He described his displacement as a bitter ordeal he would never forget. According to him, those who remained in their homes ultimately fared no worse than those who were displaced. Another testimony came from Samiha Saad, who, after returning to her home in the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood of Gaza City, described the experience as so harrowing that she vowed never to go through it again, regardless of circumstances. 'Death here is a million times better than a life of displacement,' she stated. Despite the relief felt by many Palestinians upon returning home, the reality of widespread destruction quickly led to frustration, anger, and despair. The report stressed that many residents who initially returned to northern Gaza soon moved south again after realizing they had no homes to return to. Journalist Hossam Sha'at described the dire situation: 'People returned to ruins without tents, without drinking water… They are trying to rebuild their lives, gathering scraps of fabric and wood, perhaps from what remains of their homes. They walk hundreds of meters in search of water or food, sleep in the open, and spread out on the ground under the sky. As for those whose homes are still partially standing, they are trying to repair them as best they can to live among the rubble.' A Palestinian youth was documented holding a small child he had adopted after the child's parents were not found. The young man, a resident of Jabaliya, had returned to northern Gaza after staying in a school in Rafah. 'What is there for us in the north? Why return? Our homes are destroyed. We don't even have tents there,' he lamented. The report also included criticism from Palestinians against Hamas, though it emphasized that such sentiments are not widespread due to fear of the terrorist organization. Dr. 'Az al-Din Shahin, a physician from Gaza, commented: 'The supply of water to all northern areas depends on clearing the rubble from the roads and reopening them, as well as bringing in heavy equipment to restore water lines, at least at a minimal level. No one is even talking about the importance of this issue, because, of course, images of prisoner [hostage] releases are far more compelling than discussing the disasters we are living through.'

1700 physicians warn of imminent danger to remaining hostages	Within just 12 hours, 1,700 doctors and healthcare professionals signed an urgent petition demanding the immediate release of the remaining hostages in Gaza, following the alarming condition of the three hostages released last Saturday – Or Levy, Eli Sharabi, and Ohad Ben Ami. Israel Medical Association (IMA) Chairman Professor Zion Hagay warned Monday that 'the disturbing images we witnessed upon the release of the three hostages leave no doubt – the government must take every possible action to expedite the release of all remaining hostages, as quickly as possible.' He stated that the returned hostages endured physical and mental abuse along with starvation, and their condition indicates immediate danger to all remaining hostages' lives. 'The images we witnessed reminded us all of humanity's darkest days,' Professor Hagay said, calling on the international medical community 'to look into the eyes of Ohad, Eli, and Or and take a clear and unequivocal stance on the severe health condition of both the released hostages and the many who remain captive.' Israel Medical Association Chairman Professor Zion Hagay. Photo credit: Oren Cohen The petition, addressed to the prime minister, members of the Diplomatic-Security Cabinet, and government ministers, warns that 'we have come to the stark realization that the hostages who are still alive are no longer merely in 'harsh captivity' or difficult conditions: they are being held in life-threatening conditions.' Professor Naftali Stern, an endocrinologist and director of the Sagol Center for Epigenetics at Ichilov, who led the petition, addressed the condition of one released hostage: 'Eli Sharabi, who was a full-bodied man, is now just a skeleton. Had he remained there for another two months, what would have been left of him?' Stern, a child of Holocaust survivors, added: 'I am the son of Holocaust survivors, and if there's one message I've passed on, it's 'never again.'' Thousands of protestors react while participating in the weekly rally to released the hostages calling on the continuation of the ceasefire and hostage agreement on February 08, 2025 in Tel Aviv, Israel. Photo credit: Alexi J. Rosenfeld/Getty Images The physicians who signed the petition emphasized they were 'not naive' and understood the war's cost. 'We have experienced wars as both soldiers and doctors,' the petition states, 'but this is not the situation before us. Israel is no longer in immediate danger and has already struck its enemies decisively, even if the mission is not complete.' 'The sight of the returned hostages caused an emotional collapse and shock,' Professor Stern said. 'We are many months past the existential danger, and there is no reason and no ability to live alongside the fact that dozens of our people are being held in starvation and extermination sites. These people could simply not wake up one morning. Physically, their time has simply run out.' The petition concludes with a grave warning: 'This is not a political position but a medical outcry from doctors and health professionals. Every minute counts. We warn publicly and will warn from every possible platform: those who are still alive will not survive. Their return cannot be delayed by a day, not by an hour.'

Trump says without Iran deal US could 'bomb the hell out of it'	President Donald Trump disclosed plans Friday to broker a deal with Iran that could prevent Israeli military action, telling The New York Post in an exclusive Air Force One interview that he prefers diplomacy over force. 'I would like a deal done with Iran on non-nuclear. I would prefer that to bombing the hell out of it,' Trump said during an exclusive interview aboard Air Force One, emphasizing Tehran's desire for survival. 'They don't want to die. Nobody wants to die.' The president indicated that his diplomatic initiative could potentially prevent Israeli military action against Iran. 'If we made the deal, Israel wouldn't bomb them,' Trump told The New York Post, though he remained deliberately vague about specific details of potential negotiations. Then-presidential candidate Donald Trump gestures as he speaks during a campaign rally at Van Andel Arena in Grand Rapids, Michigan on November 5, 2024 (AFP / Kamil Krzacynski) Maintaining strategic ambiguity about his approach, Trump explained his reluctance to publicly detail his message to Tehran. 'In a way, I don't like telling you what I'm going to tell them. You know, it's not nice,' he said, suggesting that his proposal could influence Iran's current strategic calculations. The president expressed optimism about potential outcomes if Iran responds positively to his diplomatic overtures. 'I hope they decide that they're not going to do what they're currently thinking of doing. And I think they'll really be happy,' Trump said, emphasizing his commitment to finding a diplomatic solution. While outlining his preference for negotiation, Trump remained firm about his position. 'I'd tell them I'd make a deal,' he said, though he declined to specify potential terms, noting only that he wouldn't pursue military action, saying 'I won't bomb them.' Regarding the specific incentives he might offer Iran, the president maintained his strategic silence, stating only that 'I can't say that because it's too nasty,' while reiterating his preference for diplomatic engagement over military confrontation.

Saudis fume after Netanyahu's statehood joke	Saudi Arabia issued a sharp rebuke to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday, The National reported, rejecting his tongue-in-cheek suggestion that the kingdom could host millions of Palestinians on its territory and sparking a broader diplomatic confrontation. The Saudi Foreign Ministry condemned what it called an 'extremist, occupying mentality' after Netanyahu told Israel's Channel 14, 'The Saudis can create a Palestinian state in Saudi Arabia; they have a lot of land over there,' in response to questions over the controversial US plan to relocate Gazans temporarily in order to rebuild Gaza. Saudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman meets US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, not pictured, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Wednesday, March 20, 2024 (AP/Evelyn Hockstein) In a strongly worded statement, the Saudi Foreign Ministry criticized what it described as ongoing Israeli actions in Gaza without directly addressing Netanyahu's specific comments about relocating Palestinians to Saudi territory. The United Arab Emirates and Egypt joined in condemning Netanyahu's proposal, according to The National. The Saudi statement emphasized that Palestinians have deep historical and legal connections to their land. 'The kingdom stresses its categorical rejection to such statements that aim to divert attention from the continuous crimes committed by the Israeli occupation against the Palestinian brothers in Gaza, including the ethnic cleansing they are subjected to,' the Saudi Foreign Ministry statement said. The ministry added that more than 160,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly children and women, have been killed or injured. 'They are not intruders or immigrants to it who can be expelled whenever the brutal Israeli occupation wishes,' the statement continued. The proposal has drawn particularly sharp criticism from within Saudi Arabia itself. Yousef bin Trad Al-Saadoun, a member of the Saudi Shura Council, responded with a pointed counter-suggestion, Middle East Eye reported. Al-Saadoun proposed that President Donald Trump should consider relocating Israelis to Alaska or 'after annexing it,' to Greenland. Writing in the Saudi newspaper Okaz, Al-Saadoun delivered a stern message about regional sovereignty. 'The Zionists and their supporters must realize well that they will not be able to lure the Saudi leadership and government into the traps of media maneuvers and false political pressures,' he wrote, according to Middle East Eye. The Shura Council member criticized what he characterized as the US approach to Middle East policy. 'The official foreign policy of the United States will seek the illegal occupation of sovereign land and the ethnic cleansing of its inhabitants, which are the Israeli approach and are considered crimes against humanity,' Al-Saadoun said in his Okaz column. He further argued that 'this plan was certainly formulated and approved by the Zionist entity, and was handed over to their ally to read from the White House podium,' Middle East Eye reported. UAE Minister of State Khalifa Shaheen Al Marar expressed full solidarity with Saudi Arabia, declaring the kingdom's sovereignty a 'red line' and rejecting any infringement on Palestinian rights. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks during a press conference in Jerusalem, Dec. 9, 2024 (AP/Maya Alleruzzo) Al Marar called for an end to construction in communities in Judea and Samaria, warning such activities threaten regional stability. He urged the UN Security Council to address practices that violate international law. The Saudi Foreign Ministry's comprehensive statement outlined its position in stark terms, emphasizing the broader regional implications. 'The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia appreciates the condemnation, disapproval and total rejection announced by the brotherly countries towards what Benjamin Netanyahu stated regarding the displacement of the Palestinian people from their land,' the statement read, according to The National. The ministry forcefully rejected what it characterized as attempts to shift focus from the situation in Gaza. In its statement, it emphasized that 'this extremist, occupying mentality does not understand what the Palestinian land means to the brotherly people of Palestine and their emotional, historical and legal connection to this land.' The statement took particular issue with the humanitarian impact of recent events, noting that Israeli actions had 'completely destroyed the Gaza Strip, killed and injured more than 160,000, most of them children and women, without the slightest human feeling or moral responsibility.' Addressing longer-term peace prospects, the Saudi statement pointed to specific obstacles: 'The proponents of these extremist ideas are the ones who prevented Israel from accepting peace by refusing peaceful coexistence, rejecting the peace initiatives adopted by the Arab countries.' The ministry noted these actions had affected Palestinians 'for more than 75 years, with disregard to the truth, justice, law and the values established in the United Nations Charter.' The statement concluded with a firm position on Palestinian rights, declaring they 'will remain firmly established and no one will be able to take it away from them no matter how long it takes.' It emphasized that 'lasting peace will not be achieved except by returning to the logic of reason and accepting the principle of peaceful coexistence through the two state solution.'

Military experts cast doubt on Iran's new drone carrier after spo...	Iran launched the 'Shahid Mahdavi' on Thursday, its first drone carrier vessel for the Revolutionary Guards' naval forces, as reported by Tasnim news agency in an extensive dispatch featuring images and video footage of the large ship and its aircraft complement. However, military analysts identified numerous technical inconsistencies in the presentation, casting doubt on the ship's actual operational capabilities. The footage displayed various drone models either airborne or positioned on the vessel's deck, which bears standard naval gray coloring. The carrier features a 590-foot flight deck suitable for small aircraft operations, having been converted from a commercial vessel with the addition of a flight deck. Released imagery showed three drone variants and four helicopters aboard the vessel, which Iranian authorities claim will extend their strike capabilities well beyond Iranian territorial waters. Revolutionary Guards commander General Hossein Salami stated the ship can conduct 'independent operations' without escort vessels. 'Iran poses no threat to any nation, but we will not yield to any power,' Salami declared. Yet despite the elaborate presentation and commander's bold claims, online observers quickly identified discrepancies in the released materials. 'Iran's boast about launching 24-inch radio-controlled model aircraft from a ship is inadvertently comical. The video later reveals the true scale of the Qaher drone, which is actually ten times larger than shown,' military analyst Oliver Alexander posted on X. Another observer highlighted the conspicuous lack of an arrest system on the 'drone carrier's' deck – essential equipment for landing aircraft. The absence of arrest system preparations on the aircraft themselves raises doubts about Iran's capability to conduct launch and recovery operations from the new vessel.

We are keeping you in our hearts and our prayers. As president, I will not rest until every last hostage is returned,' Trump said. Among those present at the meeting was Noa Argamani, who was rescued in a daring IDF raid in the summer. 'Noa survived the unbelievable and returned by the grace of God – she is an inspiration to everyone,' Trump said, Israel Hayom reported. The meeting comes just days after Trump vowed to let Israel obtain its objectives in the ongoing war with Hamas and even said that the US would 'take over' Gaza after the Palestinians leave it so that it could be rebuilt. This has had a ripple effect around the world, with Trump doubling down on the Gazan emigration scheme on Wednesday, saying that the Israel would hand over the territory to the US after the fighting concludes.

Hypocrisy will be exposed': Israel defense chief orders Gaza eva...	Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz has directed the Israel Defense Forces to develop a comprehensive plan enabling the voluntary evacuation of Gaza residents, following President Donald Trump's announcement regarding US control of the Gaza Strip. The initiative, unveiled Thursday morning, represents a significant shift in approach to the region's humanitarian challenges. 'I welcome President Trump's bold initiative,' Minister Katz declared. 'The people of Gaza should have the right to freedom of movement and migration, as is customary everywhere in the world. The plan will include exit options via land crossings, as well as special arrangements for departure by sea and air.'

Photo credit: Abir Sultan/EPA Katz highlighted Hamas' role in the current crisis, stating that the organization has systematically used Gaza residents as human shields, embedded terror infrastructure within civilian areas, and now holds the population hostage, extracting funds through manipulation of humanitarian aid while restricting their ability to leave Gaza. 'Countries such as Spain, Ireland, Norway, and others, which have falsely accused Israel over its actions in Gaza, are legally obligated to allow Gazans to enter their territory. Their hypocrisy will be exposed if they refuse. Meanwhile, countries like Canada, which has a structured immigration program, have previously expressed willingness to take in residents from Gaza.' US President Donald Trump speaks in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, US February 4, 2025. Photo credit: Elizabeth Frantz/Reuters The Wall Street Journal published an extensive report Wednesday detailing the evolution of the US President's plan. According to administration officials versed in Middle East strategy, Trump's proposal was recently developed, maintained under strict confidentiality, and shared exclusively with his closest advisors and confidants. The broader administration remained unaware of the plan's formulation during the period leading up to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit. However, the report indicates that hints of the strategic thinking behind the plan occasionally emerged. During a late summer discussion, Trump characterized the Gaza Strip as prime real estate to Netanyahu, inquiring about potential hotel development opportunities, according to a source privy to the conversation. The newspaper noted that during this exchange, Trump did not mention the possibility of US oversight of the Gaza Strip.

All that glitters: Netanyahu gifts Trump golden pager	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented a symbolic golden pager to US President Donald Trump during their summit meeting at the White House in Washington, marking a significant moment in US-Israel relations. Inscribed with the words 'Press with both hands,' the pager serves as a direct reference to explosive devices that detonated when handled by Hezbollah operatives. The inscription was strategically designed to ensure maximum impact on the target. Upon receiving the gift, President Trump said it was 'a great operation.'

Israel announces withdrawal from UN human rights council	Foreign Minister Gideon Saar declared Wednesday that Israel will withdraw from the United Nations Human Rights Council, aligning with the United States' stance of non-participation in the organization. In a pointed critique, Saar characterized the council as a platform that systematically undermines Israel's diplomatic standing while failing to address genuine human rights concerns globally. Saar argued forcefully that the council serves as a mechanism for protecting human rights violators, enabling them to evade international scrutiny. He specifically condemned the body's 'obsessive focus' on demonizing Israel, the sole democratic state in the Middle East, rather than genuinely addressing worldwide human rights challenges. Israel welcomes President Trump's decision not to participate in the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC). Israel joins the United States and will not participate in the UNHRC. The UNHRC has traditionally protected human rights abusers by allowing them to hide from scrutiny, and… — Gideon Sa'ar | גדעון סער (@gidonsaar) February 5, 2025 The most striking statistic Saar presented was the disproportionate number of condemnatory resolutions targeting Israel. Over 100 resolutions have been passed against the country, representing more than 20% of all council resolutions – a number that surpasses the combined total of resolutions against Iran, Cuba, North Korea, and Venezuela. Moreover, Israel remains the only nation with a dedicated agenda item, which Saar views as clear evidence of institutional bias. By withdrawing from the council, Israel sends a powerful diplomatic message about its unwillingness to participate in what it considers a fundamentally prejudiced international mechanism. Saar's announcement reflects a broader strategy of challenging what Israel perceives as systemic discrimination within multilateral institutions.
