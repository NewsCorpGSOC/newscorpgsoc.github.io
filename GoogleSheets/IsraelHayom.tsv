IDF soldier who survived Oct. 7 escapes Brazil as court seeks arr...	An Israeli soldier, who survived the October 7 Nova festival massacre and subsequently participated in military operations in Gaza, departed Brazil today (Sunday) after a federal court issued an investigation order against him on suspicion of genocide and crimes against humanity. The investigation stemmed from a complaint filed by a pro-Palestinian organization. The soldier had been vacationing in Brazil when the order was issued. IDF soldiers during Operation Iron Swords in Gaza (Photo: IDF Spokesperson's Unit) In a related development in Israel, the Ima Era (Awake Mother) organization, representing mothers of combat soldiers, delivered a strongly worded letter today to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi regarding the Brazilian authorities' investigation. The mothers expressed serious concern that unclear governmental policies and inflammatory statements by cabinet ministers are exposing soldiers to international legal jeopardy. 'The IDF has been conducting operations for 15 months without clear objectives or strategy due to the government's failure to establish definitive policies,' the letter emphasizes. 'This has resulted in a prolonged, exhausting campaign that not only drains our soldiers but also creates space for extreme viewpoints to penetrate both the IDF internally and the global perception externally.' The mothers highlight the government's inadequate response to repeated warnings about soldiers' vulnerability to international legal action. 'Israel's government has chosen willful ignorance, allowing the chaos instigated by its most radical ministers to expand unchecked,' their letter states. At a recent emergency gathering of reserve commanders two weeks ago, participants cautioned that IDF personnel and defense officials would face increased risk of overseas arrest should the Israeli judicial system's independence be compromised. Former Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit, who previously served as chief military advocate general, echoed these concerns during the conference. בברזיל פתחו בחקירה נגד תייר ישראלי שביקר במדינה ושירת בצה'ל במהלך המלחמה. הוא נאשם ב'פשעי מלחמה'- ולגודל האבסורד מדובר בבחור שניצל מהטבח במסיבת הנובה, אבל אותו מאשימים בפשעי מלחמה!!! לא מפתיע אותי כשמדובר במדינה כמו ברזיל שהנשיא האנטישמי שלה לולה האשים את ישראל ברצח עם, טען… pic.twitter.com/nytExnNCCm — יוסף חדאד - Yoseph Haddad (@YosephHaddad) January 5, 2025 Public diplomacy representative Yoseph Haddad addressed the situation on his X platform account, characterizing Brazil's actions as antisemitic. 'This behavior is predictable from a country like Brazil, led by an antisemitic president, Lula, who has accused Israel of genocide, compared IDF operations to Hitler's actions, and absurdly claimed Israel killed 12 million children in Gaza (demonstrating an astounding level of ignorance).'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/01/05/idf-soldier-who-survived-oct-7-escapes-brazil-after-court-issues-arrest/	2025-01-04T22:59:29-08:00	
Government failed to respond to Hamas sexual violence, report fin...	A comprehensive report by the Israel Women's Network and the Women and War Documentation and Research Collective reveals critical failures in Israel's response to sexual violence during and after the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre. The report highlights systematic governmental failures, including unimplemented UN resolutions and ignored civil society warnings about protecting women and children in conflict zones. 'We're more than a year into the event, and no one can guarantee that if this happens again, the state will handle it differently,' says Tal Hochman, executive director of the Israel Women's Network. The report, which will be submitted to multiple government offices, including the Prime Minister's Office and ministries of defense, foreign affairs, and justice, points to a 'lack of knowledge and professional capability within governmental mechanisms.' Video: Israeli interrogation of Gaza father and son confessing to rape and murder of civilians on Oct. 7 National security researcher Shira Shaham emphasizes that sexual violence in conflicts represents a fundamental security issue, not merely a women's rights concern. 'A security concept that doesn't consider aspects of dangers to women is an incomplete security concept,' she states. The report criticizes the absence of an official, transparent government account of war crimes and sexual violence during the attack. It particularly emphasizes the ongoing plight of hostages who 'continue to be exposed to violence in general and gender and sexual violence in particular' in Hamas captivity. In April, National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi directed the establishment of a 'national team on gender violence following Oct. 7' to integrate the issue with a broad perspective. The team brings together representatives from various government ministries and security branches, and focuses on action in diplomatic and international dimensions, working with UN bodies and human rights organizations. The State Attorney's Office stated, 'A thorough investigation of all Oct. 7 events has been and continues to be conducted, examining the role of each and every one of those investigated. Beyond this, at this stage we cannot detail the particulars and findings of the investigations.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/01/05/government-failed-to-respond-to-hamas-sexual-violence-report-finds/	2025-01-04T22:21:00-08:00	
It drives the antisemites crazy': French vigilante erases pro-Ha...	Claudine (pseudonym), a content creator from France, has discovered a powerful and innovative approach to expressing her views in public spaces: under cover of darkness, she transforms pro-Hamas and pro-Palestinian graffiti into messages supporting hostage return and French values of liberty. 'I'm fighting for our freedom,' she declares, 'public spaces belong to everyone, not to extremists.' Growing up in the southern suburbs of Paris, Claudine was immersed in a multicultural environment where Jews, Muslims, Christians, and secular individuals coexisted against a predominantly leftist political backdrop. Born to a Jewish father who escaped Tunisia in 1960 and a non-Jewish French mother, she was raised with strong principles of liberty and equality, though she identifies as a 'secular French Jew.' @tous_resistants #freefrance ♬ Paris my passion - Music For Business In the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack, she made a pivotal decision to revisit her graffiti roots with a new mission. 'I began with massive graffiti declaring 'HAMAS RAPE' and 'FUCK HAMAS,'' she reveals. Since then, her nighttime missions involve locating anti-Israel graffiti such as 'Free Gaza' and 'Death to Israel,' which she transforms into messages advocating for hostage return, accompanied by French flags. Her activism has created ripples within the French hip-hop community where she belongs, which she estimates is 90% pro-Palestinian. 'They despise me for utilizing tools they considered their exclusive domain,' she notes, 'but that doesn't faze me. I avoid confrontation, violence, or arguments – I simply take action.' @tous_resistants Chacun peut agir. ' Love Israel ' #fckhms #bringthemhomenow #savethewest #freeworld #laïcité #feminist #loveisrael ♬ Love Is Gone (Acoustic) - SLANDER, Dylan Matthew When Claudine started sharing her activities on social media in July 2024 with the message 'everyone can act,' she initially faced pushback from the Jewish community, concerned about potential antisemitic backlash. Yet gradually, both Jewish and non-Jewish supporters reached out with gratitude and offers to join her cause. 'I'm not leading a group, but sparking a movement,' she emphasizes. Now, she receives documentation of similar actions from throughout France and neighboring countries including Germany, Luxembourg, and England. Roughly two months ago, she expanded her presence to TikTok, despite facing platform restrictions.

'French society cannot accept neighborhoods dominated by women in full cover,' she observes, 'France's secular identity is fundamental to our national character.' Nevertheless, she has grown skeptical about change emerging from within Muslim communities. 'While I wish they would stand up against Islamists and champion equality, I've abandoned that hope.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/01/05/it-drives-the-antisemites-crazy-french-content-creator-erases-pro-hamas-graffiti/	2025-01-04T18:30:19-08:00	
NYT: UNRWA prepares to cease operations in Gaza, West Bank	The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) plans to fully suspend its operations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the New York Times reported today (Friday). The report indicates that the agency's decision comes in response to legislation passed by the Knesset in October. UN officials indicated they are preparing to terminate operations in both territories primarily because the new laws will prevent Israeli officials from engaging with UNRWA. The agency emphasizes that coordination with the Israel Defense Forces is essential whenever its personnel deliver aid or traverse areas throughout Gaza and sections of the West Bank. 'Without the ability to share this information with Israeli authorities on a daily basis our teams would face severe security risks,' Louise Wateridge, a senior UNRWA official in Gaza, said. She noted that the Gaza war has already claimed the lives of more than 250 UNRWA workers.

Controversial 'Generals' Plan' in northern Gaza picks up steam	Eight members of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee have recently signed a letter demanding that Defense Minister Israel Katz immediately replace the operational plan in Gaza. A situation report presented to committee members recently reveals that Hamas is swiftly rebuilding in every area from which the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has withdrawn, including rearming in Khan Yunis and Nuseirat. Likud Member of Knesset (MK) Amit Halevi initiated the letter, which was signed by MKs from all coalition factions. It contains harsh criticism of the war's conduct thus far and demands that Katz himself replace the current operational plan, which Halevi describes as 'stagnation,' with a strategy focused on 'victory and decisive action.' Members of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, who closely monitor IDF operations since the start of the ground offensive, argue that the ground operation that began on October 27, 2023, and its subsequent execution, 'fails to achieve the war's objectives as defined by the political echelon – dismantling Hamas's governmental and military capabilities.' They note that these goals remain unrealized, despite the operation taking place in a relatively small area against an enemy lacking the tools and capabilities of a modern army. The signatories contend that the IDF's current approach, relying on focused raids, allows Hamas to repeatedly rebuild its capabilities. This strategy, they argue, has resulted in a war of attrition that does not bring about a decisive outcome. Gaza as seen from the US Air Force overflying the Gaza Strip, Thursday, March 14, 2024 (AP / Leo Correa) AP / Leo Correa Alongside Halevi, MKs Zvi Sukkot, Ariel Kellner, Ohad Tal, Nissim Vaturi, Osher Shkalim, and others have endorsed the letter. Essentially, they are advocating for the implementation of the 'Generals' Plan,' which involves evacuating the population from northern Gaza and imposing a siege. They believe this approach will lead to effective control over the territory and population, allowing for 'cleansing the enemy from Gaza and striving for a decisive victory rather than stagnation and a war of attrition in which Israel bears the brunt of exhaustion.' The letter further reveals a stark claim from the committee members: soldiers in Gaza are dying in vain. 'We repeatedly send our soldiers into neighborhoods and alleys they've conquered multiple times before. These are areas IDF leaders have declared cleared of Hamas battalions and enemy presence. Yet in these same places, we continue to pay a terrible and unbearable price in blood.' Katz, who due to the war's intensity has not received the customary 100 days of grace in his new role, is now tasked with reevaluating the operational plan alongside the Prime Minister. They are expected to lead the implementation of the 'Generals' Plan' to defeat Hamas wherever the IDF needs to engage. The proposed strategy involves several steps: First, encircling and evacuating the population. This would be followed by the remote destruction of all energy sources, including fuel and solar facilities, and the elimination of food sources such as warehouses and water reservoirs. The plan also calls for the remote elimination of anyone moving in the area who does not surrender with a white flag during the siege. Only after these actions and a period of siege on those who remain should the IDF gradually enter for a complete clearing of enemy strongholds. This approach, the signatories argue, would minimize unnecessary risks to IDF soldiers' lives. It's worth noting that the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee and its subcommittees serve as the primary oversight body for the military and defense establishment in executing war plans and achieving objectives. They receive weekly intelligence briefings detailing the progress of forces and achievements on the ground. In some instances, especially members of the subcommittees receive more substantiated and accurate information than cabinet members who convene for ad-hoc decision discussions.

The prolonged nature of the Gaza war, now exceeding a year without achieving its stated objectives, has become a source of deep concern for many Israelis. This includes parents of soldiers, families of hostages, and residents of communities bordering Gaza. Committee members, who field repeated inquiries on this matter and compare them against IDF responses, fear that the current approach will fail to achieve the war's objectives, both in the near term and long-term. 'To date, IDF representatives in the committee have failed to provide satisfactory explanations for why they are not taking the necessary actions to decisively defeat the enemy, nor have they outlined clear plans for the future,' the letter concludes. 'We therefore request your immediate intervention to address these questions and provide appropriate directives to the IDF. The goal must be to achieve a decisive victory and halt the unjustified risk to our soldiers' lives.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/01/02/knesset-committee-pushes-for-controversial-generals-plan-in-gaza/	2025-01-01T21:00:24-08:00	
Trump to Hamas: Better let the hostages come back soon	President-elect Donald Trump issued a stern message to Hamas regarding the hostages held in Gaza during New Year's Eve celebrations at his Mar-a-Lago club, declaring 'They better let the hostages come back soon,' according to ABC News. Addressing reporters before the party, Trump remained brief when questioned about the possibility of a ceasefire in the war, stating only, 'We're going to see what happens.' As of Nov. 2, 100 Israelis are being held hostage by Hamas in Gaza, 36 of whom have been declared dead.

He noted a sense of widespread positivity, saying, 'There's a whole light over the whole world, not just our country. They're a lot of happy people.' When asked about his New Year's resolutions, Trump responded, 'I just want everybody to be happy, healthy and well.'

The precision strike was carried out by an Air Force aircraft, utilizing intelligence gathered through coordinated efforts. Meanwhile, the defense establishment is laying groundwork for expanded operations in northern Gaza, contingent on Hamas' continued failure to provide names of hostages slated for release through negotiations.

Report: US sends $22B in military aid to Israel since Oct. 7	Since the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre, the United States has dramatically intensified its military support for Israel, committing more than $22 billion to bolster military operations across Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, American weapons supply to Israel increased from 69% in 2019-2023 to 78% currently. By December 2023, Israel received military equipment worth $2.4 billion, with the value growing to $12 billion by August 2024. As Israel's most significant ally, the United States provides advanced military equipment including Iron Dome defense system missiles, precision-guided bombs, CH-53 heavy transport helicopters, AH-64 Apache combat helicopters, and armored vehicles.

How Israel kept the hostages in its heart through 2024	2024 was undoubtedly marked by the resounding call to 'Bring them home.' These 365 days, perhaps the longest in the nation's history, saw Israeli citizens adamantly refuse to leave the hostages behind. Media outlets, family members, and countless citizens joined forces to keep public attention focused on the hostages' plight. In a year of unprecedented turmoil, many continued their daily struggle for the freedom of their brothers and sisters held captive in Gaza by enemy forces. As the new year approaches, Israelis must reflect on twelve months of diverse initiatives: from public demonstrations to powerful speeches and compelling exhibits – each effort, though yet to achieve its ultimate goal, strengthening the collective resolve. One hundred men, women, and children remain in captivity, possibly unaware that another year has passed.

Photo credit: Jack Guez/AFP AFP The yellow ribbon, originally a symbol of captivity, evolved into a powerful emblem of solidarity. From Olympic venues to cultural festivals, even appearing on holiday treats in bakery windows, these yellow markers became deeply embedded in the national consciousness. Nearly every public event throughout the year included at least a mention of those still waiting to come back home in Gaza. Town squares across Israel transformed into visual testimonials, gradually filling with portraits of the hostages and calls for their return. The imagery became so pervasive that it reshaped the character of many cities, with local residents turning their public spaces into monuments of solidarity with the hostages' families.

These vacant seats, often paired with hostage photographs, appeared in locations nationwide – from city squares to urban centers to ordinary streets – each chair standing empty, waiting for them to come home. Public demonstrations, though sometimes controversial, maintained consistent pressure throughout the year. Weekly gatherings at Hostages Square and other locations kept the issue at the forefront of national dialogue.

They organized massive marches in Tel Aviv, blocked roads, lit bonfires, spray-painted protest slogans, and set up stages where people spoke about bringing the hostages home. These rallies drew support from government ministers, artists, and other public figures. Israelis demonstrating for the release of the hostages held in Gaza on Sept. 1, 2024.

20 killed in clashes between new regime, Assad loyalists in Syria	A Syrian activist from Aleppo supporting the new government revealed to Israel Hayom that recent clashes erupting across western Syria are being orchestrated by pro-Iranian elements. 'The demonstrations were contained and specific. Participants included minority groups, former regime loyalists, Iranian supporters, and suspected war criminals. These protests were organized to provoke a civil war, following Supreme Leader Khamenei's statement threatening Syria's stability,' explained the resident of the northwestern Syrian city. Media outlets aligned with the pro-Iranian axis have deliberately amplified footage of the protests, aiming to catalyze further demonstrations that could escalate into widespread unrest. A significant Alawite minority population remains in Syria, expressing discontent with the ascension of Islamist factions to power. Simultaneously, the Christian community faces mounting tensions following provocative acts, including the burning of a Christmas tree during holiday celebrations. Syrian rebels celebrate following the takeover of Damascus, in Homs, Syria, Dec. 8, 2024 (EPA/Bilal Al Hammoud) EPA/Bilal Al Hammoud The Interior Ministry of Syria's new government confirmed that 17 security personnel lost their lives and 10 sustained injuries in an ambush by former Assad regime loyalists. The Syrian Center for Human Rights documented three armed opposition casualties in the provincial clashes. Intelligence reports indicate that Internal Security forces were attempting to apprehend a former Assad regime officer linked to operations at the notorious Saidnaya prison complex near Damascus. Syrian sources informed the center that the target was a military justice division director implicated in thousands of executions. The confrontation escalated in a Tartus province village when locals blocked security forces from conducting house searches. An Interior Ministry official disclosed to Al Jazeera that former regime members deliberately torched an Alawite prayer house. The source maintained this was calculated to ignite sectarian conflict, resulting in armed confrontations with local groups and several Internal Security force casualties. Addressing military developments, the Aleppo resident discussed Israel Defense Forces operations in southern Syria, stating, 'Syria and its people require stability to enable displaced persons to return home. Further displacement from Israeli military actions is unwanted. Following the withdrawal of Iranian militias that threatened both nations, we see no justification for continued Israeli offensive operations.' While rejecting Iranian influence, the government supporter embraces Turkish engagement: 'Syria now welcomes cooperation with all nations. Turkey's assistance in stabilizing Syria has been particularly constructive and appreciated.' The resident expressed optimism about Arab state support: 'The removal of Iranian presence, which previously obstructed solutions and deterred Arab support, has enabled humanitarian aid and development projects. Border crossings have reopened, advancing Syria's reconstruction. Arab nations are eager to see a stable, rehabilitated Syria.' Despite ongoing challenges, he emphasized feeling secure for the first time since Assad's departure and the end of 'his criminal control' over Syria.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/26/20-killed-in-clashes-between-new-regime-assad-loyalists-in-syria/	2024-12-26T00:41:27-08:00	
NY Times report says IDF expanded civilian risk protocol after Oc...	An investigation by The New York Times has revealed significant changes in Israel's military operations following the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, including expanded target selection and modified risk assessment protocols. According to the investigation, the IDF issued an order at 1 p.m. on Oct. 7, 2023, that gave mid-ranking officers expanded authority to strike Hamas targets. The change came in direct response to the morning's attacks, which killed 1,200 people and saw approximately 250 others taken hostage by the terror group. The New York Times reported that Israel increased its target range while adjusting civilian risk parameters, leading to approximately 30,000 munitions being fired into Gaza in the war's first seven weeks – surpassing the total used in the following eight months combined.

Photo credit: Jack Guez/AFP Jack Guez/AFP The report indicated that after depleting its pre-existing database of vetted targets, the IDF switched to a new artificial intelligence system for identifying targets. Instead of using detailed surveillance methods employed in previous campaigns, the military began relying on statistical models based on cellphone usage patterns to assess civilian presence. According to The New York Times, the IDF raised its civilian casualty risk threshold from previous limits of zero to five casualties to a new standard allowing up to 20 civilian casualties per strike. However, the report indicated that senior commanders occasionally approved strikes on Hamas leaders knowing they could endanger more than 100 civilians. Additionally, the military reduced its use of warning shots, known as 'roof knocks,' that traditionally gave civilians time to evacuate. The IDF responded that its forces continue to operate within legal parameters, emphasizing that the changes were necessary due to the unprecedented nature of the conflict and Hamas's tactics of operating within civilian areas.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/26/ny-times-report-says-idf-expanded-civilian-risk-protocol-after-oct-7/	2024-12-25T21:30:26-08:00

Political fashion: Al-Julani's tie as an anti-Iranian statement	Yesterday (Sunday), Syrian leader Ahmed Al-Shara—known as Abu Mohammad al-Julani—met with leaders of the Druze community in Lebanon and the Turkish foreign minister while sporting a tie. This was the first time the head of Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham was seen wearing one, making it a noteworthy event. At this point, you might be wondering if you're reading an article from Makor Rishon or a Mediterranean fashion magazine, but rest assured—relax in your seat and join us on a short journey exploring the status of ties in the Muslim world. The Taliban is well-known for imposing strict limitations on appearance and clothing in Afghanistan, particularly for women. Alongside the infamous requirement for women to wear a burqa and for men to grow beards, the Sunni terrorist organization has also banned ties. Before the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021, suits and ties were popular attire in Afghan society. Last year, senior Taliban figure Mohammad Hashim Shahid Wror declared ties to be Christian symbols and therefore forbidden in Afghanistan. Back in 2022, ties were already banned in Afghan schools. 'The history of the tie in Islam is clear. What is a tie? It's a cross. Sharia instructs us to break and destroy it,' Wror stated at the time. Wror, who heads the Taliban's guidance department, is responsible for shaping the organization's religious policies. The ban on ties is not unique to Afghanistan. Another prominent example is Muslim-majority Iran.

Religious leaders in the Shiite country viewed ties as a Christian symbol or, at the very least, as representing Western culture. Members of the Basij militia used to patrol the streets of major cities with scissors to cut ties off people's necks for years, though local authorities only partially enforced the law. At the start of the 21st century, more and more young Iranians—many of whom oppose the Ayatollah regime and its religious coercion—began wearing ties, particularly at weddings and funerals. This trend may have prompted authorities to take the ban more seriously. In 2008, Iranian customs deputy Asghar Hamidi announced that the country would prohibit the import of ties. By 2012, authorities instructed clothing stores to dispose of their tie inventories, and businesses whose logos featured ties were ordered to redesign them.

Photo: EPA In 2010, then-Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad caused a stir when he said that no Shiite cleric had ever officially forbidden ties, prompting rebukes from religious scholars. That same year, a uniquely Iranian tie was designed in the shape of Zulfiqar—the sword of Imam Ali, the Prophet Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law. According to Shiite belief, Ali is the second-most important figure in Islam, and his historical status is central to the Sunni-Shiite divide. This unique tie was adorned with hadith (oral traditions in Islam) and was approved for use by several senior Shiite clerics. Interestingly, the ban on ties in Iran is still enforced, albeit selectively, mostly targeting foreign visitors or residents. The prohibition on ties dates back to the Shah's era, when ties were a popular accessory in Iran. However, the Persian connection to ties has deep historical roots. British scholar Noel Malcolm argued in his book A Brief History of Bosnia that ties were first introduced to Europe from Iran during the Sasanian Empire (3rd–7th centuries CE). So, is Al-Julani's decision to wear a tie yesterday a political or fashion statement? Was it merely intended to complement his suit, or does it reflect an effort to distance himself from Islamic fundamentalism in general and Iran in particular? Perhaps the Mediterranean fashion magazine has the answers. For now, we will stay with the questions.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/25/political-fashion-al-julanis-tie-as-an-anti-iranian-statement/	2024-12-24T23:40:30-08:00	
Egypt battles online campaign aimed at stirring unrest	Egypt's State Information Service has launched an aggressive counter-campaign to combat online rumors, particularly those propagated by the Muslim Brotherhood. According to Egyptian authorities, these coordinated digital efforts aim to destabilize the nation and incite civil unrest. The Muslim Brotherhood, which has been designated as a terrorist organization in Egypt for more than a decade, remains a primary concern for security officials. Recent weeks have witnessed the widespread circulation of historical protest footage across social media platforms. The content distributors, some identifying themselves as members of the Syrian opposition or Houthi supporters from Yemen, have been sharing archival videos showing Egyptian citizens removing pro-President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi signage and crowds chanting the revolutionary slogan 'The people want to topple the regime.' This governmental response comes at a particularly sensitive time, as Cairo monitors potential regional ripple effects in the wake of the collapse of Assad's regime in Syria. Egyptian President, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi attends the closing session of the Arab League summit, in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, 29 March 2015. Photo credit: Khaled Elfiqi/EPA EPA Diaa Rashwan, chief of the State Information Service, emphasized that the campaign's primary objective is to enhance public awareness and resilience against 'purveyors of rumors and falsehoods who seek to undermine national stability, social cohesion, and public trust in state institutions.' He stressed that the initiative aims to reach every Egyptian citizen through strategic social media engagement. The state campaign, already operational under the banner 'Verify it before you believe it,' focuses on elevating public consciousness about social media misinformation. Rashwan outlined a comprehensive approach targeting all demographic segments of Egyptian society, promoting critical information verification practices before sharing content, and emphasizing the paramount importance of consulting official, authorized sources for accurate information.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/25/egypt-battles-online-campaign-aimed-at-stirring-unrest/	2024-12-24T20:00:43-08:00	
Mohammed Sinwar frustrates hostage deal mediators	Recent optimism surrounding hostage negotiations has given way to mounting frustration as Israeli officials reveal significant obstacles in their dealings with Hamas – specifically with Mohammed Sinwar's approach to the talks. Sources close to the negotiations paint a picture of deliberate obstruction, describing how Yahya Sinwar's brother has consistently misled mediators over weeks, stonewalling requests for hostage lists and withdrawing from previously reached agreements. Security and political officials expressed deep concern over Mohammed's handling of negotiations on Hamas' behalf. Two critical roadblocks persist: Hamas' continued refusal to provide a list of hostages for initial release, and disagreements over the prisoner exchange ratio and deportation terms. Demonstrators take part in a protest to show support for the hostages who were kidnapped during the deadly October 7 attack, amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, in Tel Aviv, Israel, September 4, 2024. Photo credit: REUTERS/Florion Goga REUTERS/Florion Goga Israeli officials emphasize that the hostage list represents a fundamental prerequisite for progress, and Hamas' refusal to provide it effectively prevents discussion of other contested issues. The initial optimism expressed by Israeli ministers, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has collided with Hamas' calculated approach to negotiating the hostages' fate. The war's conclusion remains another contentious point. Despite initially indicating a willingness to set aside this demand to start talks, Hamas now insists on including a pathway to end the conflict in any agreement. As reported earlier this week, security officials have privately told ministers that entering into the first phase of a deal would likely lead to its eventual completion to secure all hostages' return. Cabinet ministers appear increasingly willing to accept the heavy costs involved in such a deal, but they remain opposed to ending the war – which could once again become a major obstacle to reaching an agreement.

The positioning of IDF forces during any ceasefire also appears to have preliminary consensus. A senior cabinet minister revealed to Israel Hayom that while several issues under discussion could lead to a breakthrough, each also carries the potential to derail negotiations entirely. Both parties are mindful of Trump's upcoming January 20 inauguration, with Hamas concerned about deteriorating conditions and Israel anticipating stronger support for increasing pressure on Hamas – potentially allowing hostage recovery without current Biden administration constraints.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/24/worse-than-his-brother-mohammed-sinwar-frustrates-hostage-deal-mediators/	2024-12-24T06:26:06-08:00

Irresponsible': US ambassador Lew slams agency's Gaza famine rep...	A US government agency's dire warning about potential famine in northern Gaza has prompted an unusually strong rebuttal from US Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew, exposing a rare public disagreement over humanitarian assessments in the region. The Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) issued a report Monday night warning that 'If the food supply remains cut off from North Gaza Governorate, the combination of starvation and disease would most likely push non-trauma mortality above 2 people/10,000/day between January and March, meeting the third criterion for Famine (IPC Phase 5).' In response, Ambassador Lew issued a sharp critique: 'At a time when inaccurate information is causing confusion and accusations, it is irresponsible to issue a report like this.' FEWS NET, established by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and still partially funded by it, operates with support from NASA, the US Department of Agriculture, and other government agencies, as evidenced by USAID's logo on the FEWS NET website. This institutional backdrop makes Ambassador Lew's forceful rejection of the famine warning particularly significant. 'The report issued today on Gaza by FEWS NET relies on data that is outdated and inaccurate. We have worked closely with the Government of Israel and the UN to provide greater access to the North Governorate, and it is now apparent that the civilian population in that part of Gaza is in the range of 7,000-15,000, not 65,000-75,000 which is the basis of this report.' Trucks carrying humanitarian aid cross into the Gaza Strip from Erez crossing in southern Israel, Monday, Oct. 21, 2024. Photo credit: AP/Tsafrir Abayov AP To support his position, the senior American official referenced the Israeli Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) estimate of 5,000 to 9,000 Arab residents in northern Gaza, while noting that 'UNRWA estimates the population is between 10,000 and 15,000.' Addressing accusations about inadequate food delivery to northern Gaza, Lew emphasized, 'We work day and night with the UN and our Israeli partners to meet humanitarian needs — which are great — and relying on inaccurate data is irresponsible,' he concluded.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/24/irresponsible-us-ambassador-lew-slams-agencys-gaza-famine-report/	2024-12-23T23:45:00-08:00	
Trump, Biden aids demand Hamas free US hostages	In a powerful display of bipartisan cooperation, Robert O'Brien, former White House national security adviser under Trump, and Tom Nides, former US Ambassador to Israel under Biden, published a joint opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal Monday addressing the urgent plight of American hostages in Gaza since the Oct. 7 massacre. The authors revealed that from the twelve Americans initially taken hostage, four have been freed through negotiations, while Hersh Goldberg-Polin was murdered before Israeli forces could reach him. Seven Americans remain in Hamas captivity, including three confirmed deceased whose remains have not been returned. 'Hamas should interpret this bipartisan support as an unequivocal American unity,' O'Brien and Nides emphasized. 'Its supporters throughout the region must understand that returning our unlawfully detained citizens is a deeply rooted priority for the US government.' President-elect Donald Trump (AP/Alex Brandon) AP/Alex Brandon The officials highlighted the rare alignment between current and former presidents on this critical issue. 'President Biden and his team have been working tirelessly toward this goal,' they stated, while noting that 'President-elect Trump has issued a stark warning that the American Seven must be released before his return to office or face 'hell to pay.'' O'Brien and Nides outlined significant strategic shifts in the region, 'The strategic situation – for both the US and our close ally Israel – has markedly improved compared to a year or even a month ago.' They detailed how 'Hezbollah stands weakened, accepting a ceasefire under international supervision. Syria's regime has fallen, severely limiting Iran's ability to use it as an operational base and supply route for its proxies.' The authors specifically named each American hostage still in captivity: Edan Alexander, Itay Chen, Sagui Dekel-Chen, Gadi Haggai, Judi Weinstein Haggai, Omer Neutra and Keith Siegel. 'These families face another holiday season [Hanukkah] with an empty chair at their dinner table,' they wrote poignantly. 'Hamas and their supporters must receive this message with absolute clarity: Release the Americans in the first phase of the deal. Every single one,' they conclude firmly. 'This is the best offer Hamas will ever receive.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/24/in-rare-joint-plea-trump-biden-officials-demand-hamas-release-us-hostages/	2024-12-23T22:21:34-08:00

Pro-Iranian militias reportedly agree to stop firing on Israel	A senior figure in Iraq's pro-Iranian militia Al-Nujaba Movement (known as HHN) has confirmed that Iran's proxies in the country have reached an agreement with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' Al-Sudani to cease military operations targeting Israel in support of Gaza, the pro-Hezbollah Al-Akhbar reported on Monday. The agreement also includes maintaining silence regarding political developments in Syria, coming amid dialogue sparked by regional and international pressure to dismantle these factions and transfer their weapons to state control. Speaking to Al-Akhbar, the figure revealed that 'the factions have decided not to interfere in Syrian affairs and to monitor the situation from a distance while also awaiting the policy directions of US President-elect Donald Trump, particularly regarding the Middle East and Iran.' The source indicated that 'the Islamic Republic of Iran has granted us the freedom to decide on the Syrian scene and the control of terrorist groups such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS).' He criticized American and Israeli efforts promoting the dissolution of the Iraqi government's umbrella organization for militias, the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), describing these attempts as aimed at forcing the surrender of the resistance axis that has effectively challenged Israel over the past year. Iranian missiles on the background of a banknote of Iranian rials (Getty Images / Anton Petrus) Getty Images / Anton Petrus 'The armed factions have adhered to the Iraqi government's directives, especially after developments in Syria, where there are concerns about a scenario worse than the fall of Bashar Assad's regime, potentially leading to the resurgence of terrorism in Iraq,' the leader added. Prime Minister Al-Sudani recently dismissed suggestions about disbanding the PMF, stating in a televised interview that 'such claims are purely speculative and come from those who oppose the political process.' This came after an Iraqi official had disclosed receiving multiple international and regional requests to dismantle the PMF and transfer weapons to state control. Kazem Al-Fartousi, spokesperson for the Kata'ib Sayyid al-Shuhada Brigades, another pro-Iranian militia, told Al-Akhbar, 'Circumstances determine the positions of the factions. The principle of unity across fronts is not tied to a temporary alliance among resistance axis factions but is a matter of doctrine and conviction. Regardless of the losses, Iraqi factions have never abandoned this principle.' Al-Fartousi explained that 'the operations of the factions against Israel were linked to Hezbollah's operations in Lebanon. When a ceasefire was reached in Lebanon, the Iraqi factions also halted their operations. There are also partners in Iraq with reservations about these operations, and their perspectives must be considered.' He added, 'The situation is currently under review, and communication is ongoing among the resistance axis to coordinate positions and develop a unified vision.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/23/pro-iranian-militia-reportedly-vows-to-stop-firing-on-israel/	2024-12-23T01:20:45-08:00	
Bashar Assad going through divorce? Not so fast	In recent days, Turkish media published what appears to be false information regarding Syrian former president Bashar Assad's supposed impending divorce from his wife Asma. In response, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov issued an official statement vigorously denying 'claims circulated by Arab and foreign media outlets about Asma Assad filing for divorce.' It should be noted that the former Syrian leader's wife is battling leukemia. In the days before the Assad regime's collapse, she was staying in Moscow. This followed her husband's visit, who had to return to Damascus before fleeing when his army collapsed.

The source, speaking to Baghdad Alyoum, indicated that the US administration has set an informal timeline of 'a few months' for Tehran to respond to the proposal for negotiations, which would encompass various issues, with the nuclear file taking precedence. The diplomatic overture comes as Iranian diplomat Seyyed Hossein Mousavian published an analysis in an Iranianian outlet suggesting that direct, high-level talks between the two nations could be imminent.

Hamas concedes military capabilities lost, shifts to other tactic...	Sources within Hamas admitted Sunday that Israel Defense Forces operations have successfully neutralized most of their military capabilities in Gaza, forcing the terrorist organization's fighters to adopt alternative tactics. Speaking to the Saudi newspaper A-Sharq Al-Awsat, Hamas sources revealed that fighters on the ground are now making decisions independently without receiving direct orders from senior command. While they still attempt to update higher-ranking officials about their plans, these communications can take hours or even days to reach what remains of Hamas's leadership in Gaza. Among the surviving senior Hamas commanders in Gaza are Mohammed Sinwar, brother of Yahya Sinwar, who has reportedly taken command of the military wing; Izz ad-Din al-Haddad, responsible for terrorists in northern Gaza; Mohammed Shabana, who served as commander of the now-disbanded Rafah Brigade; and Tawfiq Abu Naim, head of Hamas internal security apparatus. div]:bg-bg-300 [&_.ignore-pre-bg>div]:bg-transparent [&_pre]:-mr-4 md:[&_pre]:-mr-9' style='box-sizing: border-box; border-image: initial; --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: hsl(var(--accent-secondary-100)/1); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 #0000; outline-color: hsl(var(--accent-main-100)); position: relative; padding-right: 2.25rem; line-height: 1.65rem; font-family: var(--font-claude-message); border: 0px solid hsl(var(--border-100));'> _*]:min-w-0' style='box-sizing: border-box; border-image: initial; --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: hsl(var(--accent-secondary-100)/1); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 #0000; outline-color: hsl(var(--accent-main-100)); display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(1, minmax(0px, 1fr)); gap: 0.625rem; border: 0px solid hsl(var(--border-100));'> The IDF's Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee warned over the weekend that Hamas is spreading falsehoods to maintain its fighters' morale.

Hezbollah terrorist leader's ring gets surprise bid	Iranian media outlets reported a ring belonging to Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah was sold at a public auction for the equivalent of $16,000. It appears to be one of the rings worn by the head of the terrorist organization, who was killed in an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) strike in September. The ring worn by Nasrallah was sold for a whopping $16,000 (Arab social media) The ring was sold for $16,000, with the proceeds to be transferred to the Lebanese people. The Iranian news agency IRNA reported in October that Iran's Ofogh TV network intended to sell Nasrallah's ring at a public auction, with the revenues meant to 'go to the Lebanese people.' Mojtaba Rahmandoost, a member of Iran's Shura Council, said he received the ring as a gift from Nasrallah in February 2014 and would put it up for public auction. Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah gives a televised address at a memorial ceremony to mark one week since the killing of Wissam Tawil, a commander of Hezbollah's elite Radwan forces on January 14, 2024 Reuters / Aziz Taher Wearing rings is an ancient custom in Shiite Islam. The ring is usually worn on the right hand. Among the pro-Iran axis, the rings worn by Qassem Soleimani, slain commander of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi are particularly well-known. Soleimani was killed in January 2020. The ring was used to identify his body after the US strike. According to various reports, Raisi's body was also identified by the ring on his hand after his helicopter crashed. Similar rings are worn by Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and senior members of pro-Iranian militias in Iraq. The ring apparently symbolizes, among other things, the connection between members of the axis. A Lebanese cleric told the BBC's Arabic network that the ring is linked to several Islamic and Arab traditions. However, he notes that a person must not be attached to a stone out of a belief that it can harm or benefit them.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/22/hezbollah-terrorist-leaders-ring-gets-surprise-bid/	2024-12-22T01:19:51-08:00
