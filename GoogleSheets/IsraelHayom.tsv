Israel fears Syrian events could destabilize Jordan	Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar and Military Intelligence Directorate (Aman) head Shlomi Binder visited Jordan on Friday to address shared interests in light of developments in Syria. Israel is concerned, as reported in Israel Hayom last Friday, that regional instability could also destabilize Jordan internally, and that Iran may intensify its attempts to smuggle weapons through Jordan into Judea and Samaria (The West Bank) due to a lack of alternative routes. This marks the second visit by senior Israeli defense officials to a neighboring country within a week. Last week, the Shin Bet chief and the IDF Chief of Staff visited Egypt to address Israel's concerns over violations of the peace treaty between the two nations. Despite the peace agreements, the evolving situation in Syria poses a risk to regional stability. The Syrian rebels, Photo: AFP The Israeli defense establishment is particularly alarmed by potential unrest in the West Bank fueled by events in Syria. Officials fear that extremist Islamic actors, inspired by Syrian rebels, may launch attacks. In response, the IDF has decided to reinforce security measures for Israeli settlements in the Judea and Samaria and bolster the protection of main roads in the region. Meanwhile, the Palestinian security forces launched a special operation this morning aimed at reasserting control over the Jenin refugee camp. A spokesperson for the Palestinian security forces announced the operation, titled 'Defending the Homeland.' Simultaneously, clashes erupted between Palestinian security forces and armed militants in Tulkarm. Militants hurled explosive devices and opened fire at the Palestinian Authority's headquarters in the city. So far, the security forces have refrained from entering the Tulkarm refugee camp, responding instead with gunfire from a distance.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/14/israel-fears-syrian-events-could-destabilize-jordan/	2024-12-14T12:24:11-08:00	
Trump considers strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities	President-elect Donald Trump's transition team is formulating what it calls a 'Maximum Pressure 2.0' strategy against the Iranian regime, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. While Trump's first administration focused on harsh economic sanctions against Iran, his second term could include military measures, including the possibility of strikes on nuclear facilities. One approach, as described by two sources familiar with the plan, involves increasing military pressure by deploying additional US forces, fighter jets, and ships to the Middle East. The US may also sell advanced weapons to Israel, including bunker-buster bombs that would enhance its capability to disable Iranian nuclear facilities. A student looks at Iran's centrifuges in an exhibition of the country's nuclear achievements, in Tehran, Iran, Wednesday, Feb. 8, 2023 (Photo: AP /Vahid Salemi) AP An alternative path seeks to use the threat of military force, particularly when combined with US sanctions, to push Tehran toward a diplomatic solution. 'Anything could happen,' Trump said in an interview with Time magazine published Thursday, noting there's a possibility the US could go to war with Iran, partly because Tehran had plotted to assassinate him. 'It's a very explosive situation.' Several incoming administration officials have yet to express their views on the matter. Iran-related proposals may evolve as cabinet officials settle into their roles, classified information becomes available, and discussions with regional allies like Israel occur. Significantly, Trump tends to delve into details of foreign policy only when final options are presented and a decision is required, according to former Trump administration officials. Trump advisers supporting the military option are primarily suggesting backing Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities like Natanz, Fordow, and Isfahan, and even considering US participation in a joint operation.

Trump supporters argue that the first months of his second term will provide a rare opportunity to act against Iran's nuclear program while the regime is in a weakened position. This contrasts with recent US policy: the Obama administration pursued the 2015 nuclear deal, Trump withdrew from it and imposed economic sanctions, and Biden attempted to revive the agreement but faced Iranian rejection.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/13/trump-considers-strikes-on-irans-nuclear-facilities/	2024-12-13T00:37:17-08:00	
WSJ: Hamas agrees to IDF presence in Gaza as hostage deal talks a...	Hamas has conceded to two of Israel's primary conditions for a ceasefire agreement in Gaza, Arab mediators told The Wall Street Journal, potentially paving the way for a deal that could see some hostages released within days despite previous failed negotiations. The terror group informed mediators it would accept Israeli Defense Forces maintaining a temporary presence in Gaza after fighting ends – a significant shift from its earlier stance. Hamas also provided a list of hostages, including American citizens, it would free under a ceasefire agreement, marking the first such disclosure since the initial November 2023 truce. The new initiative, developed by Egypt with US backing, aims to build on the relative success of the November ceasefire along the Israel-Lebanon border, which has largely held despite occasional accusations of violations from both Israel and Hezbollah. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday there was some movement in ceasefire talks while cautioning it was premature to determine if an agreement was achievable. The latest proposal, according to mediators who spoke to The Wall Street Journal, envisions a 60-day ceasefire during which up to 30 hostages held in Gaza, including US citizens, would be released. In return, Israel would free Palestinian security prisoners and allow increased humanitarian aid into Gaza.

Photo credit: EPA/Abir Sultan EPA Diplomatic efforts intensified this week as an Israeli delegation visited Cairo on Tuesday, following recent meetings between Hamas officials and Egyptian leaders. US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan is scheduled to travel to Israel, Egypt and Qatar this week to advance negotiations, the mediators told The Wall Street Journal. While previous negotiations repeatedly failed, Hamas has recently shown increased flexibility on crucial issues. Mediators said this includes accepting a temporary IDF presence in the Philadelphi corridor – a narrow strip along Gaza's border with Egypt – and the Netzarim corridor, which bisects the enclave. The terror group has also agreed not to operate or maintain a presence at the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza. Hamas' shift followed the Lebanon ceasefire agreement involving its ally Hezbollah. That deal left Hamas increasingly isolated in its conflict with Israel, particularly after Israeli strikes significantly damaged its leadership and fighting capacity. Arab negotiators cautioned that Hamas could still withdraw from the agreement at the last moment, as it has done before. On Sunday, Hamas presented mediators in Cairo with a list of hostages including US citizens, women, elderly individuals, and those with medical conditions, as well as the remains of five dead hostages, Arab mediators told The Wall Street Journal. The terror group also compiled a list of Palestinian security prisoners in Israeli facilities whose release it seeks as part of the exchange.

Photo credit: IDF Spokesperson's Unit IDF Spokesperson's Unit Israeli negotiators are currently seeking the release of more hostages during the initial ceasefire phase while agreeing to gradually withdraw from the Philadelphi corridor. Israel has informed negotiators it would reposition forces in other parts of Gaza but rejected restrictions on its presence in other areas, including northern Gaza. The war was triggered by Hamas' deadly Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people – mostly civilians who were murdered in their homes and at a music festival – and saw about 250 people taken hostage. According to Israeli officials, 96 hostages remain in Gaza, mostly Israeli citizens, including dual nationals, and at least 30 are no longer alive. Four additional pre-Oct. 7 hostages bring the total to 100.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/12/wsj-hamas-agrees-to-idf-presence-in-gaza-as-hostage-deal-talks-advance/	2024-12-11T23:30:07-08:00	
Video speed dating for religious Jews launched	There's nothing more frustrating than an unsuccessful first date.

Everyone fears you': Kurdish forces plead for Israeli military a...	The Israeli defense establishment is weighing requests for assistance from Syria's Kurdish minority, who are under attack from Turkish-backed Islamist groups. The appeals for help have reached Israeli officials in recent days following the advancement of these groups and their successful capture of Kurdish-held territories. Israel and the Kurdish forces have maintained an ongoing dialogue, which has strengthened significantly following the fall of the Assad regime. The Israeli dilemma stems partly from the potential impact such intervention could have on relations with Erdogan's Turkey, as well as the American position, which favors stopping the fighting through diplomatic means. Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar has led diplomatic discourse supporting the Kurds and Druze in Syria, raising the issue in meetings with his European counterparts and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Their appeals to Israel have also reached Israel Hayom, 'You control the skies, you didn't hesitate to take the big mountain (Syrian Hermon). Everyone fears you, including al-Julani (leader of the rebel group that overthrew the Assad regime). Turkey is against you, and we are with you. You must help us, for your own interests,' says A. Awak, one of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) commanders in the southeastern sector of the Syrian autonomous region, in a fragmented conversation from the Syria-Iraq border. Abu Mohammad al-Julani, the leader of Syria's Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group that headed a lightning rebel offensive snatching Damascus from government control (Aref Tammawi/AFP) Aref Tammawi/AFP 'The Turks are determined to exploit the success of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and conquer all of Syria to make it their client state,' he adds. 'Only we can prevent this, but we need external help from the West, especially from you, because everyone fears you now. The day isn't far when these Islamist groups will turn against you too.' 'This is a historic opportunity that Israel must seize,' says Professor Ofra Bengio, one of the world's leading experts on Kurdish affairs. 'Israel should assist the Kurdish minority in Syria so they can maintain their autonomy in the northeast of the country.' During Syria's civil war, the Kurds, a pro-Western and pro-Israeli minority, managed to establish control over a quarter of the country's territory – a larger area than most other opposition groups. The Kurdish region in Syria, bordering Iraq to the east, also serves as a buffer against pro-Iranian groups operating in southern Iraq that launch drones and missiles toward Israel. The Turkish interest becomes apparent as the fall of the Assad regime to militias from northwestern Syria in the past ten days has raised immediate concerns among the Kurds. Although this marks the fall of one of their enemies, there are growing fears that Turkish-backed militias will turn against them - a fear that has already begun to materialize. The Islamist groups have captured the provincial city of Manbij near the Turkish border from Kurdish forces, with fighting only stopping after American intervention - though it continued on other fronts. In recent days, they also captured the city of Deir ez-Zor in eastern Syria, including its strategic airport, as well as the city of Al-Bukamal on the Iraqi border. The Kurds retreated across the Euphrates River but fear continued attacks with Turkish support. An Israeli diplomatic source says that Israeli involvement now, even behind the scenes, has more advantages than disadvantages, 'It's clear to us too that the moderation displayed by the heads of the Islamist rebel headquarters in Syria is for PR purposes, and when they can, they will turn against Israel. The Kurds are allies who have helped us in various ways.' However, he emphasizes, 'The picture is complex, and we cannot act there without American consent. There's a chance the Americans won't be too angry if we independently attack targets in the south, far from Turkey, without claiming responsibility.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/12/everyone-fears-you-kurdish-forces-plead-for-israeli-military-aid/	2024-12-11T22:00:23-08:00	
Syrians uncover massive Captagon drug operation in wake of Assad'...	As the Assad regime crumbles, warehouses and factories of drugs are gradually being discovered across Syria dedicated to producing Captagon, a synthetic drug known as the 'poor man's cocaine.' The narcotic, which has wreaked havoc on youth throughout Arab nations, had evolved into a multi-billion dollar annual enterprise. The proceeds flowed directly into Assad regime coffers, providing crucial funding despite international sanctions. The Fourth Division, commanded by Gen. Maher Assad – the brother of deposed President Bashar Assad – played a central role in the Captagon trafficking operation. Foreign reports indicate Maher Assad has sought refuge in Iraq. اهل سوريا بدأوا بحملة اتلاف حبوب الكبتاجون التي كانت في مصانع بشار و ماهر الاسد وبقية مسؤولي النظام pic.twitter.com/NkX5Dyut41 — عمر مدنيه (@Omar_Madaniah) December 11, 2024 Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite party, maintained deep involvement in the narcotics trade, establishing a network of smugglers to move drugs across the Jordanian border. This revelation delivers another significant blow to the terror organization, which not only recruited smugglers but deliberately addicted them to Captagon. Under Assad, Syria had emerged as the world's premier Captagon producer, outpacing even Mexico's drug output. Currently, Syrians are disposing of Captagon stockpiles found in former regime facilities into the sewer system. Footage shows workers dumping bins filled with pills into sewers, while at another location near Damascus, investigators discovered massive drug caches concealed within electrical cabinets. Abu Mohammad al-Julani, who heads Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a coalition of Islamist rebel organizations, declared in an address that the new leadership plans to tackle this industry, noting that Syria had become a playground for Iranian interests.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/12/syrians-uncover-massive-captagon-drug-operation-in-wake-of-assads-fall/	2024-12-11T21:00:37-08:00	
Inside Syria: Israel Hayom joins IDF in Golan buffer zone	We entered the Syrian buffer zone through routes heavy with historical weight – the same paths where Syrian forces breached Israeli defenses during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Since the 1974 Disengagement Agreement, IDF soldiers could only observe Tel Kudna – which we entered this morning in an armored convoy – through binoculars. Now, in a matter of hours, our forces have taken control of the entire buffer zone along the northern Golan Heights. Our journey began at Alonei HaBashan, meeting troops from the IDF's 474th Brigade of the Bashan Division. We donned protective vests, with helmets required only for the border crossing until reaching our destination. The armored vehicle carrying us traversed newly paved routes, created just days ago to facilitate rapid troop movement. En route to the Syrian position at Tel Kudna, we drove through rural areas where locals primarily subsist on farming and shepherding. Those remaining in the area regard the IDF presence with indifference, occasionally even offering smiles. In recent months, our forces repeatedly dealt with shepherds approaching the fence, which is sometimes used as cover by hostile elements. Some locals retain positive memories of the IDF from a decade ago, when our forces provided medical assistance and humanitarian aid, and according to foreign reports, military equipment as well. A notebook used for studying Hebrew, found at a former Syrian army position. Photo credit: Lilach Shoval We passed a UN position adorned with solar panels. Despite Syrian President Bashar Assad's army no longer maintaining a presence here, UN forces remain in the area, receiving IDF protection when needed. The area is now manned by soldiers from the 101st Paratrooper Battalion, who were home on leave after fighting in several Lebanese villages, including Al-Khiyam, following extended combat in the Gaza Strip. Called up Saturday for the Syrian ground operation, these troops weren't surprised – they've grown accustomed to sudden mobilizations after a year of continuous deployments. This time, they secured enemy territory without firing a single shot. From Tel Kudna's peak, Israeli territory spreads clearly before us – windmills spinning near the community of Yonatan. The Syrian side reveals the broader Golan Heights and a former Syrian position now under our control. Bashar Assad's photo at an abandoned military position in Syria. Photo credit: Lilach Shoval The position is visibly dilapidated. Combat trenches mirror those on the Israeli side. Inside, we found scattered garbage, old uniforms, a broken radio, and Arabic documents caught in the wind. In one building, I discovered a pink notebook – apparently a Syrian soldier's attempt to learn Hebrew. Beyond basics like 'we,' 'you,' and 'they,' it contained military terms: army, division, battalion, company. The debris tells of the hasty Syrian withdrawal last Friday. Their forces assembled, received orders, and departed quickly. Within 24 hours, IDF troops secured the position without resistance. Since entering, the IDF has begun establishing itself in the location, but until containers and equipment can be brought into the area, soldiers sleep on simple mattresses inside the abandoned buildings. When we arrived, some soldiers were engaged in operational duties, primarily maintaining observation of nearby populated areas as well as more distant regions to ensure no enemy forces were approaching. Others rested, exercised, or gathered around campfires. Unlike my previous encounters with troops in Gaza and Lebanon this year, these soldiers showed marked reluctance toward photographs or named quotes. They cited concerns about the International Criminal Court in Hague and potential travel restrictions. Departing, we took an unpaved route carved by the IDF engineering corps. If our presence extends, they'll pave it to facilitate movement, particularly during the harsh Golan winter. The 'New East' anti-tank obstacle. Photo credit: Lilach Shoval We passed the 'New East' obstacle – a lengthy anti-tank trench with earthen barriers. This defense, one of the security measures adopted following Oct. 7, 2023, aims to prevent armed vehicle incursions into Israeli territory. Anyone attempting to breach this obstacle would need engineering equipment and at least 40 minutes to an hour – critical time allowing our forces to mobilize if necessary. Though construction began earlier, recent events accelerated the work. Completion estimates suggest roughly a year, with teams racing to accomplish maximum progress before winter arrives.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/11/inside-syria-israel-hayom-joins-idf-in-syrian-buffer-zone/	2024-12-11T10:12:01-08:00	
Right-hand man of Syrian rebel leader revealed	The rebels' control over most of Syria and the fall of the Assad regime sparked a faint hope that a new regime in Damascus might adopt a pragmatic stance toward Israel, avoiding open support for its enemies. This hope was bolstered yesterday when al-Julani declared that his government's primary priority is to fight the Iranian axis. While Jerusalem waits to see how the new Syrian administration will act, one figure is critical for Israeli readers to understand to grasp the worldview of Tahrir al-Sham—the driving force behind the rebels' victory over Assad's regime. That figure is Abdel Rahim Atoun, the mufti of the organization and head of the Shura Council of the government it established in Idlib, before sweeping across most of Syria. Atoun is a close confidant of al-Julani and played a key role in shaping the ideological and political foundation of the organization, which seeks to govern Syria. His influence is pivotal in the group's shift from global jihadism and al-Qaeda affiliations to embracing a Syrian national identity rooted in Islamist principles. Atoun himself has transformed, altering his rhetoric and even his appearance, trading traditional head coverings and an unkempt beard for a suit and neatly groomed facial hair, often seen seated beside al-Julaniin meetings. A Syrian rebel fighter. Photo: AFP Despite the image of moderation, Atoun's anti-Israel stance has remained unwavering and has even intensified under his new guise. The blend of nationalist sentiment with aspirations for Sunni Islamist rule has brought Atoun closer to the terrorist organization Hamas, with which he consistently expresses solidarity. He eulogized a senior Hamas figure assassinated by Israel in Lebanon, Salah al-Arouri, and celebrated the October 7 attack on his Telegram channel. Atoun does not shy away from making his position clear. At a conference he convened during the rebel offensive—dubbed 'From Idlib to Gaza'—the cleric praised the Palestinians and expressed solidarity with their fight against Israel. 'The regional enemy of Syria is Russia, while the regional enemy of the Palestinians is Zionism. The brotherhood of Islam unites Palestinians, Syrians, and all members of the Muslim ummah above all other ties. We are in a position where our commitment goes beyond actions like protests,' Atoun stated during the event. The leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, Abu Mohammad al-Julani. Photo: AFP. Atoun often draws parallels between the 'Iranian project,' referring to Tehran's involvement in Syria's internal affairs and its military presence there, and the 'Zionist project,' which he claims meddles in Syria's affairs and poses a threat to it. In 2021, he condemned the US for its support of Israel, stating, 'The wound of occupation in Gaza and the wound of Syria's occupation are the same wound.' It is not yet clear what role, if any, Atoun will hold in the new Syrian government being formed by the rebels in Damascus. However, his profound influence on the leadership of the rebels is undeniable. His statements, delivered under the guise of religious authority, likely reflect at least in part the worldview of those now rising to power on Israel's northern border.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/11/the-zionists-are-the-enemy-right-hand-man-of-syrian-rebel-leader-revealed/	2024-12-11T02:15:57-08:00	
Khamenei claims 'joint American-Zionist plan' toppled Assad	Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei claimed Tehran possesses evidence that the United States and Israel orchestrated the collapse of Syria's Assad regime, according to Iranian state news agency IRNA. An opposition fighter steps on a broken bust of the late Syrian President Hafez Assad in Damascus, Syria, Sunday Dec. 8, 2024 (AP /Hussein Malla)) AP/Hussein Malla The comments come just days after Syrian President Bashar al-Assad fled to Moscow following the rapid capture of Damascus by opposition forces led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and its leader Abu Mohammad al-Jawlani, marking a dramatic end to the Assad family's decades-long rule over Syria. 'There should be no doubt that what happened in Syria is the result of a joint American and Zionist plan,' Khamenei said, according to IRNA, in his first public comments since the fall of his longtime regional ally. In his remarks reported by IRNA, Khamenei alleged that while a neighboring country – presumably Turkey – has played an evident role in Syria's situation, the primary responsibility lies with Western powers. 'Yes, the neighboring country of Syria has played a clear role in this matter and continues to do so – this is evident to all – but the primary conspirator, the main planner, and the central command room are in the United States and the Zionist regime,' he said. The Supreme Leader further claimed to have definitive proof of these allegations, stating: 'We have evidence. This evidence leaves no room for doubt.' The statement marks Iran's first official response to the fall of Assad's government, which Tehran had supported militarily and financially throughout Syria's civil war.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/11/irans-khamenei-claims-joint-american-zionist-plan-toppled-assad/	2024-12-11T00:01:55-08:00	
Inside Assad's new life in Moscow	Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov confirmed Wednesday morning the presence of former Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad on Russian soil, validating widespread speculation that President Vladimir Putin had granted political asylum to the Syrian dictator. After ruling his country for nearly a quarter century, Assad has now joined the millions of refugees who fled Syria during its civil war, officially going into exile. But for those of us accustomed to the Syrian ruler over the years, and perhaps feeling sympathy for the tall, lanky eye doctor, the following details might change that perspective. A man holds an AK-47 and flashes the victory sign as he poses for a photo in a hall of Syrian President Bashar Assad's presidential palace in Damascus, Syria, Sunday, Dec. 8, 2024 (Photo: AP/Hussein Malla) AP Russian media outlets recently reported extensively on the Assad family's assets within the Russian Federation, with their astronomical value revealing the incredible scale of the Assad regime's plunder from its citizens. According to reports, President Assad owns 18 luxury apartments in the prestigious City Capitals project, while other family members hold an additional 20 luxury units in the development. Together, the family controls substantial portions of two skyscrapers in central Moscow's financial district. It remains unclear whether Assad plans to house family members who fled Syria's dire circumstances in these numerous apartments or intends to rent them for substantial income. Additional reports indicate Assad owns other global assets worth at least $2 billion. Western media outlets have suggested Assad plans to retire from political life and return to his work as an ophthalmologist at hospitals in Russia and the United Arab Emirates. While the accuracy of these reports remains uncertain, given the estimated wealth the ruler has positioned outside Syria's borders, he likely won't need to work a single day for his livelihood.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/11/inside-assads-new-life-in-moscow/	2024-12-10T23:00:16-08:00

A formal welcoming ceremony unfolded at the Knesset plaza, where President Peña arrived with a high-level delegation, including the parliament president, cabinet ministers, and additional lawmakers. The delegation participated in a meaningful signing ceremony in the Chagall State Hall, followed by press statements and a photo session, before meeting with Ohana in his office. Israeli President Isaac Herzog hosted President Peña earlier in the day, opening with heartfelt remarks. 'We are honored to host you and your wife here in Israel. Your arrival comes at a time when the Israeli public, people, and nation have endured and continue to endure an extraordinarily challenging, painful, and agonizing period. We have suffered the loss of our sons and daughters while 100 hostages remain captive in Gaza's tunnels.' In response, President Peña expressed his gratitude, stressing that he was 'accompanied by a large and diverse delegation, including Congressional representatives from Paraguay. This demonstrates our support for Israel during these challenging times. But believe me, Mr. President, this was something we needed to do for ourselves. It represents a moral imperative from the Paraguayan people, and we carry with us the heart and spirit of over six million Paraguayans who feel deeply connected to the people of Israel. For us, this truly marks a historic turning point.' Speaking before the Knesset, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the assembly and said: 'To the families of the hostages, our distinguished guests, and especially President Peña, my dear friend, and his wife Leticia – along with the esteemed Paraguayan delegation including the Speaker of the House – your significant visit, Mr. President, during our existential war fought on seven fronts against those seeking our destruction, merits exceptional recognition. During this conflict, we were deeply moved by your declaration that 'we will always stand with Israel, regardless of the cost – because this is the right side of history.'' Netanyahu continued, adding that 'taking a moral position isn't always the easy choice. Many turn away, many choose silence, thinking, 'this isn't our fight.' As a courageous, proactive leader, you chose engagement over indifference, and history will remember those who stood with Israel in its darkest hour. Our struggle is the struggle of all free nations. 'We face ruthless enemies, fanatics, barbarians. They attacked us with unspeakable brutality over a year ago. Their heinous crimes defy human description, and even the terrible footage only captures a fraction of these atrocities – the worst since the Holocaust. We are imposing severe consequences for their aggression, dismantling their infrastructure.

In this wild and turbulent region, we remain steadfast in our mission. We draw strength from our past, act decisively in the present, and work to shape the future. Your visit will strengthen the growing bonds between Paraguay and Israel. Together, we can achieve remarkable things. 'We admire the energy and experience you've brought to rejuvenate Paraguay toward a promising future. Israel eagerly seeks to assist you; we believe in sharing the fruits of progress with our friends rather than keeping them for ourselves. 'We will continue to defend ourselves resolutely against those who seek our destruction.

Inside Assad's deserted palace: A trail of anxiety pills and shat...	Rebel fighters and civilians roamed the grounds of Bashar Assad's presidential palace on Tuesday, stepping over shredded posters of the ousted leader who fled to Russia days earlier, according to The Wall Street Journal. Inside Assad's abandoned office, books, papers, and personal items lay scattered. Among them were a history of the Russian military, a map of northeastern Syria, a biography of Assad, and strips of benzodiazepine antianxiety pills. On a yellowed window overlooking Damascus, graffiti read, 'God damn your soul, Hafez,' a reference to Assad's late father, Hafez Assad, who ruled Syria for three decades before passing power to his son. The palace, perched on a hill near Damascus, offered a stark view of the final days of a dictator whose brutal tactics – including torture, bombings, and chemical attacks – defined his efforts to crush a rebellion that erupted during the Arab Spring in 2011. Demonstrators filled Umayyad Square in central Damascus, celebrating with rebel fighters brandishing rifles and waving the green, white, and black flag of the Syrian revolution. After years of civil war, Assad's regime collapsed in less than two weeks as allies Russia and Iran failed to halt the rebels' swift advance, The Wall Street Journal reported. Rebels aligned with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a group previously linked to al Qaeda, took control of several cities before entering Damascus on Sunday with little resistance. On Tuesday, a rebel soldier, Mustafa Hassan, walked through the palace's entry hall with comrades. 'The nightmare is over,' said Hassan, a former history teacher from Raqqa who joined the 2011 protests and later took up arms. Imprisoned by the Islamic State during its occupation of Raqqa, he now envisions rebuilding Syria. 'We're done with one battle, and we're beginning another: a battle of building and developing relations with other countries,' he told The Wall Street Journal.

Vast marble floors, cuboid halls, and underground bunkers showcase its dual purpose as a fortress and a symbol of power. In an underground cabinet room beneath the palace, brass plates marked the seats of high-ranking officials. Assad's seat was labeled 'The Commander in Chief.' Adjacent to this meeting room were underground living quarters with a bedroom and accommodations for staff. On Sunday, HTS fighters secured the palace after euphoric Syrians stormed it, removing furniture and artwork. Videos posted online showed people discovering a garage filled with luxury sports cars, including Aston Martins and a Lamborghini. HTS has sought to maintain order during the transition, preserving government institutions and keeping some regime police in place, The Wall Street Journal reported. This effort underscores the group's attempts to project stability and legitimacy. The fall of Assad's regime is a significant blow to Russia and Iran, his key allies. Russia's military intervention in 2015 had previously turned the tide in Assad's favor, while Iran used Syria as a conduit to support militias like Hezbollah. Now, with Russia preoccupied by its invasion of Ukraine and Iran reeling from Israeli military strikes, the rebel victory shifts the geopolitical landscape. Israel has already acted, moving troops into a buffer zone near the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights and conducting airstrikes on Syrian assets. Meanwhile, Turkey has escalated operations against Kurdish groups it views as terrorists, complicating US relations in the region. Abroad, a debate is emerging over how to handle HTS, which remains a US- and UN-designated terrorist organization. HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani has claimed to renounce extremism and proposed a vision for protecting minorities under the group's rule. However, the Biden administration has refrained from engaging with HTS, while some Western diplomats suggest reassessing its designation. In Damascus, celebratory gunfire mixed with distant explosions as signs of the regime's downfall appeared across the city. Military vehicles lay destroyed along the highway between Damascus and Beirut. Abandoned troop carriers and discarded uniforms on the streets symbolized the regime's rapid disintegration. Across Syria, residents tore down statues of Hafez Assad and replaced the regime's red, black, and white flag with the rebel banner. Youssef al-Masri, a 54-year-old Islamic scholar, joined the celebrations in Umayyad Square. 'There are no words in Arabic or in any language to express the joy that is in our hearts after the end of 45 years of repression,' he told The Wall Street Journal. 'Today, we breathe.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/11/inside-assads-deserted-palace-a-trail-of-anxiety-pills-and-shattered-power/	2024-12-10T21:00:46-08:00

Floyd Mayweather was evacuated from London's Hatton Garden jewelry district after being confronted by protesters over his support for Israel, according to a report by The Sun. The undefeated boxing champion was shopping for luxury watches and jewelry when he encountered a group of eight to ten individuals who challenged him about his stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, according to The Sun. Security footage shows Mayweather being quickly escorted into a black SUV and driven away from the scene. #FloydMayweather's visit to London was derailed by an angry mob of anti-Israel protesters this week. pic.twitter.com/6Nb2MmUBri — TMZ (@TMZ) December 10, 2024 The former boxer had recently demonstrated his backing for Israel through several high-profile visits following Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, in which more than 1,000 people were killed – mostly civilians – and 250 were taken hostage by Hamas. He also made a $100,000 donation to Israel's United Hatzalah organization. Last month, Mayweather hosted a barbecue at an Israel Defense Forces military base and met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom he publicly encouraged to 'never back down.' A witness told The Sun that the incident lasted approximately two minutes, with at least one person allegedly attempting to strike Mayweather. However, in an Instagram post, Mayweather clarified that he emerged from the confrontation unharmed and was not physically touched This is not the first time Mayweather has faced public criticism over his position on the conflict. Earlier this year, during a Las Vegas press conference for his new vape brand launch, an activist confronted him, and his security team confiscated a Palestinian flag, leading to loud chants of 'Free Palestine' from attendees.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/11/boxing-legend-mayweather-confronted-in-london-over-pro-israel-stance/	2024-12-10T18:30:39-08:00	
Operation 'Arrow of Bashan': Israel strikes amid Syrian upheaval	In a significant military campaign that began Saturday, the IDF has concluded an extensive series of strikes throughout Syria as part of Operation Arrow of Bashan. Military sources revealed that hundreds of strategic targets across Syrian territory were struck in an operation that had remained under strict operational secrecy until now. Simultaneously, the IDF Chief of Staff and the Director of Shin Bet held crucial discussions in Egypt addressing regional security concerns, including ongoing hostage-related matters. Military officials indicate the operation was launched in response to rapidly evolving developments on the ground. While surveillance of rebel activity in the region had been ongoing, the acceleration of events demanded immediate action. The operation received approval from the IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi during a Saturday security assessment, leading to the swift deployment of forces. The operation saw the deployment of 350 Israeli Air Force combat aircraft conducting multiple strike missions. Forces targeted 320 strategic assets spanning from Damascus to Tartus, including MiG-29 fighter jets, manufacturing facilities, ammunition storage sites, Scud missile batteries, cruise missile systems, unmanned aerial vehicles, aircraft and attack helicopters, radar installations, and weapons storage facilities. Strikes at the Lattakia port in western Syria. Photo credit: Arab media Naval forces joined the campaign, executing strikes against advanced Syrian naval vessels at two coastal locations – Lattakia and Minet el-Beida. Military sources confirmed that the targeted assets, which included dozens of sea-to-sea missiles capable of striking targets 50-62 miles away, had been under sustained intelligence monitoring for years. In response to the Syrian developments, IDF forces have established positions at strategic locations along the buffer zone border. This deployment aims to safeguard Israeli civilians and prevent critical military capabilities from falling into unauthorized possession. During buffer zone operations, various weapons systems were discovered, with the military emphasizing its commitment to addressing any additional armaments found in the region. Officials stress that these actions are defensive in nature and do not constitute interference in Syria's internal conflict. Addressing the Iranian dimension, military sources indicate that Tehran has experienced a substantial decline in its Syrian foothold, significantly diminishing its operational capabilities against Hezbollah. The IDF maintains its focus on the Syria-Lebanon border, emphasizing that any attempts to transfer weapons will trigger a military response.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/10/operation-arrow-of-bashan-israel-strikes-amid-syrian-upheaval/	2024-12-10T08:34:51-08:00	
Leading Syrian chemist assassinated in Damascus home	In a significant development highlighting Syria's deteriorating security situation, Dr. Hamdi Ismail Nada, a distinguished chemical scientist, was killed Tuesday at his Damascus home under what Syrian media described as 'mysterious circumstances.' Damascus-based sources characterized Nada as a leading scientific figure, warning that his death could signal 'the beginning of a phase of chaos and targeted killings orchestrated by global intelligence agencies' in the wake of President Bashar Assad's fall from power. Strikes at the Latakia port in western Syria. Photo credit: Arab media Speaking to Syrian media outlets, local sources expressed shock throughout Syria's academic and scientific circles. They emphasized Dr. Nada's prominence in his field, citing his substantial contributions to chemical research developments at both national and international levels. While the perpetrators remain unidentified, Arab media sources have reported multiple Israeli strikes over the past 24 hours targeting facilities connected to SSRC, a research institute historically linked to Syria's chemical weapons program.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/10/leading-syrian-chemist-assassinated-in-damascus-home/	2024-12-09T23:00:37-08:00	
Israel strikes hundreds of targets across Syria	The IDF conducted a wave of airstrikes in Syria overnight Monday into Tuesday, focusing on eliminating Assad regime military assets. Over the past few days, hundreds of targets have been hit, including fighter jets, arms depots, air defense systems, surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles, cruise missiles, long-range rockets, and coastal missile batteries. Despite claims to the contrary, IDF ground forces have not approached within 12 miles of Damascus. Israeli officials maintain that operations are currently restricted to the buffer zone. While this is described as a temporary measure, its duration depends on the evolving situation. Israeli intelligence remains focused on Iran, which has faced severe setbacks, losing key strategic allies like Hezbollah and, now, the Assad regime in Syria. Western powers are increasingly alarmed that Iran may accelerate efforts to enrich uranium to weapons-grade levels. Nonetheless, experts highlight that weaponization – a process estimated to take 18 months – remains a separate challenge. Strikes at the Latakia port in western Syria (Arab networks) Russian news agency Sputnik, citing Syrian sources, reported Israeli airstrikes targeting the Shayrat military airport in Homs province, alongside attacks on military installations in the provinces of Raqqa and Hasakah. Reports in Arab media suggest IDF forces have taken Hina village and advanced toward the outskirts of Khan al-Shaykh in southern Syria, capturing other locations in the region. Syrian outlets described further airstrikes on Qudsaya's outskirts near Damascus and the Qalamoun mountains along the Lebanese border. Additional hits were reported in Latakia and Homs. Syria's representative to the UN urged the Security Council and Secretary-General to 'halt Israeli exploitation of the nation's political transition.' Meanwhile, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights documented 310 airstrikes within 24 hours, targeting former regime sites and vacated military positions. Additionally, the Syrian Observatory noted that Turkish-backed factions had seized Manbij from Kurdish forces. The IDF reportedly remains stationed near the southern borders of Rif Dimashq province.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/10/israel-strikes-hundreds-of-targets-across-syria/	2024-12-09T22:30:29-08:00

Report: Hamas, Israel exchange list of names as hostage talks adv...	Negotiations for a new hostage deal between Israel and Hamas have reached an advanced stage, with both sides exchanging lists of names through mediators, according to Arab media reports. The proposed agreement could include the release of four American citizens held in Gaza who don't meet the humanitarian criteria of previous deals. Israeli sources familiar with the details assess that a 'dramatic development' could occur in the coming days. According to the source, the technical committees from Israel, Egypt, and Hamas have begun working on the details of the hostage deal. The source noted that both sides are showing unprecedented seriousness in reaching an agreement. Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, and the USA are participating in overseeing the negotiations. Rally for the release of Israeli hostages held in the Gaza Strip Gideon Markowicz According to Al-Arabi Al-Jadid, the Hamas delegation, which has since left Cairo, provided Egyptian intelligence officials with a list of names during a visit lasting several hours Sunday. According to the report, the list included names of Israeli hostages who are ill and elderly who should be included in the deal. Hamas also provided a list of prisoners in detention that they want released. Also on Sunday, Hamas announced that its delegation left Cairo after meeting with the head of Egyptian intelligence to discuss efforts for a Gaza ceasefire and the establishment of a committee to manage the strip. The delegation emphasized its pursuit of successful efforts to end the hostilities. The Qatari newspaper reported that Hamas agreed to a 60-day transition phase during which additional fuel and medical supplies would enter Gaza. As of Dec. 9, 101 Israelis are held hostage in Gaza, having been kidnapped by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7. Thirty-six of them have been declared dead.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/09/hamas-israel-reportedly-exchange-list-of-hostages/	2024-12-08T23:54:42-08:00

During the visit, they received a detailed briefing on developments along the Syrian border and the reinforcement of IDF forces in the area. Netanyahu characterized the event as 'a historic day in Middle East history,' claiming that the regime's 'collapse is the direct result of our forceful action against Hezbollah and Iran, Assad's main supporters.' He emphasized that the regime's collapse 'set off a chain reaction of all those who want to free themselves from this tyranny and its oppression.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/08/israel-seized-syrian-side-of-mount-hermon/	2024-12-08T07:12:28-08:00

Video: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visits Israel-Syria border / Credit: X/ IsraeliPM Addressing the security situation, Netanyahu clarified, 'We have to take action against possible threats. One of them is the collapse of the Separation of Forces Agreement from 1974 between Israel and Syria. This agreement held for 50 years. Last night, it collapsed. The Syrian army abandoned its positions. We gave the Israeli army the order to take over these positions to ensure that no hostile force embeds itself right next to the border of Israel. This is a temporary defensive position until a suitable arrangement is found.' Defense Minister Katz reinforced the security message, emphasizing Israel's determination to prevent a return to vulnerability along the border, promising to protect all Golan Heights communities – both Jewish and Druze. While maintaining a firm security stance, Netanyahu delivered a message of openness. He recalled the Israeli field hospital that treated thousands of Syrians during the civil war, noting that hundreds of Syrian children were born in Israel. He extended 'a hand of peace' to the Druze – 'who are brothers of our Druze brothers in Israel' – as well as 'to the Kurds, to the Christians, and to the Muslims who want to live in peace with Israel.' Netanyahu concluded by stating, 'If we can establish neighborly relations and peaceful relations with the new forces emerging in Syria, that's our desire. But if we do not, we will do whatever it takes to defend the State of Israel and the border of Israel.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/08/netanyahu-tours-syrian-border-extends-hand-of-peace-to-rebels/	2024-12-08T06:31:20-08:00	
Plane crash or exile? Mystery surrounds Assad's fate	Syrian rebels declared President Bashar al-Assad's 24-year rule over on Sunday after seizing control of Damascus, while questions swirled about the fate of the longtime leader following reports of a mysterious flight from the capital, according to Reuters. A ullet-riddled portrait of now-toppled Syrian President Bashar Assad in Hama, December 2024 (Omar Haj Kadour / AFP) Omar Haj Kadour / AFP A Syrian Air plane that took off from Damascus airport around the time rebels entered the capital initially flew toward Syria's coastal region, a stronghold of Assad's Alawite sect, before making an abrupt U-turn and disappearing from radar, flight tracking data showed. Two Syrian sources told Reuters there was 'a very high probability' that Assad may have been killed in a plane crash, though this could not be independently verified. The dramatic collapse of the regime sent thousands of Syrians into the streets of Damascus, with witnesses telling Reuters that crowds gathered in a main square chanting 'Freedom' from half a century of Assad family rule. The IDF has assessed that Assad is no longer in Damascus, though they cannot confirm whether he has left the country entirely, according to information shared with Reuters. Military sources indicated that Syria is experiencing significant instability, with the army's dissolution indicating an internal collapse. They noted that the disruption of the Syrian axis, which began following events of October 8 in the northern theater, played a crucial role in current developments. IDF officials emphasized to Reuters their close monitoring of Iranian activity in the region, focusing particularly on preventing military capabilities from moving from Syria to Lebanon. They noted that some Iranian entities are cutting ties with Syria, while warning that Israel would respond decisively if Hezbollah attempts to transfer or concentrate military capabilities along the Syria-Lebanon border. Syria's army command officially notified officers that Assad's regime had ended, according to a Syrian officer who spoke to Reuters. However, the Syrian army later claimed it was continuing operations against what it called 'terrorist groups' in key cities including Hama, Homs, and the Deraa countryside. Prime Minister Mohammad Ghazi al-Jalali called for free elections and said he had been in contact with rebel commander Abu Mohammed al-Golani to discuss managing the transition period. The Syrian rebel coalition said it is working to complete the transfer of power to a transitional governing body. While Israel maintains a policy of non-intervention in Syrian internal affairs, the IDF is closely watching the rebel organization 'Tahrir al-Sham' and assessing its governmental organization and potential impact on the border. Military officials stressed to Reuters that despite this non-intervention policy, Israel will strike against any threats, both ground and aerial. The sudden power shift marks a major setback for Russia and Iran, which had propped up Assad during critical moments in the civil war but were weakened by other regional crises. The developments have stunned Arab capitals and raised fears of new regional instability. Western governments now face decisions about how to engage with a new administration in which Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), formerly an al Qaeda affiliate, appears poised to have significant influence. The group's leader al-Jawlani broke ties with al Qaeda in 2016. 'The real question is how orderly will this transition be, and it seems quite clear that Golani is very eager for it to be an orderly one,' Joshua Landis, Director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, told Reuters. 'They are going to have to rebuild... they will need Europe and the U.S. to lift sanctions.' In Homs, celebratory crowds poured into the streets after the army's withdrawal from the strategic central city. The rebels' capture of Homs gave them control of Syria's heartland and key crossroads, cutting off Damascus from coastal regions where Assad's Alawite sect holds sway and Russian forces maintain military bases. The IDF General Staff is conducting frequent situational assessments and implementing forward defense in the buffer zone to keep threats away from the fence. They remain in contact with UN forces, who maintain their positions in Syria, while closely tracking weapons capabilities and ensuring air and ground superiority in the region. Yesterday, IDF forces worked to remove a threat to UN peacekeeping forces.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/08/plane-crash-or-exile-mystery-surrounds-assads-fate/	2024-12-07T23:57:00-08:00	
Damascus falls as Assad flees country; plane reportedly disappear...	A coalition of Syrian rebel forces claimed Sunday they have entered Damascus and taken control of key positions in the capital, marking a potential turning point in the country's long-running civil conflict. 'Militarily, Damascus has fallen,' a source familiar with the advance told CNN. In a statement posted on Telegram, the Military Operations Command declared: 'We declare the city of Damascus free from the tyrant Bashar al-Assad,' adding, 'To the displaced all over the world, a free Syria awaits you.' Local residents gather on a street in the Damascus suburb of Jaramana on December 8, 2024 (AFP/Louai Beshara) AFP While the rebels assert that president Bashar al-Assad has fled Damascus, Syria's presidential office and Iranian officials have maintained he remains in the capital. US officials told CNN that his regime could soon collapse, as rebels say they are in communication with senior Assad regime officers considering defection. A Syrian Air had left Damascus airport when the capital fell, according to data from the Flightradar website, with rebels claiming they had downed it. It was unclear who was on board. The opposition forces also announced they have 'fully liberated' Homs, Syria's third-largest city, just over a week after capturing Aleppo. Residents were observed removing Assad's posters in scenes reminiscent of pro-democracy demonstrations that occurred in the city during the Arab Spring more than a decade ago. In a significant development reported by CNN, the rebels have taken control of the Saydnaya Military Prison north of Damascus. Amnesty International had previously termed this facility 'the human slaughterhouse' in a 2017 report documenting mass hangings. A July 2023 UN High Commissioner for Human Rights report had highlighted 'continuing widespread and systematic patterns of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, including enforced disappearances' at Syrian detention facilities, including Saydnaya. According to statements released Sunday morning, rebel forces are moving to capture state media offices in Damascus. A resident of the Barzeh neighborhood confirmed to CNN that rebels were present in the area and clashes were occurring. Chaos erupted at Damascus airport early Sunday at 12:28 a.m. local time as the rebel forces advanced into the capital. CNN verified footage showing dozens of people rushing through security checkpoints and hurrying to departure gates in attempts to leave the country. The airport appeared largely unstaffed, with flight monitoring websites showing no scheduled imminent departures.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/08/damascus-falls-as-assad-flees-country-plane-reportedly-downed/	2024-12-07T20:36:22-08:00

Assad regime falls: 'Our sun has finally risen'	Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime collapsed Sunday as opposition forces seized control of Damascus, ending the family's iron grip on Syria.

We fought for this day and brought down the regime. Our sun has finally risen,' a Syrian rebel told Israel Hayom on Sunday morning, as the Assad regime crumbled. Another rebel commander from Idlib Governorate expressed his emotions to Israel Hayom: 'I swear by Allah, the magnitude of our joy is beyond words. The regime's reign has ended and with it, our tragedies. The injustice is over. Fear has vanished along with the dictatorship. Truth has prevailed, as it was destined to do. This was Allah's promise. After enduring displacement, exile, casualties, and financial losses, our patience has been rewarded. Today, we savor the sweetness of victory.' Asked about the rebels' swift success in toppling the regime in under two weeks, he explained: 'Force had to be met with force. Our joint military operations room, established by the rebels and opposition forces, proved decisive. The battles were fierce. By Allah's grace, we prevailed.' Addressing neighboring countries, including Israel, the rebel added: 'We extend our gratitude to all who supported us.'

Hafez ruled Syria from 1970 until 2000 before his son Bashar assumed power. The younger Assad fled during the night to an undisclosed location. Dramatic footage emerged showing rebels taking control of prisons in the Damascus and Homs regions. At the infamous Sednaya prison, rebels accessed the control center and liberated inmates, some of whom had been so long imprisoned they struggled to recognize themselves. The Syrian opposition leader, Ahmed al-Shara, also known as Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani, issued directives to all military forces in Damascus, ordering them to maintain distance from public institutions still under the oversight of the Assad regime's prime minister, pending an orderly transition of power. Earlier, Prime Minister Mohammad Ghazi al-Jalali announced his intention to remain in Syria and facilitate an organized transfer of authority to the organizations.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/08/assad-regime-falls-our-sun-has-finally-risen/	2024-12-07T18:30:55-08:00	
Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani: Who is Syria's de-facto ruler?	Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani, the leader of an Islamist insurgent alliance that has recently seized significant portions of Syria in a swift offensive, is working to moderate his image while pursuing his goal of overthrowing President Bashar al-Assad's government, according to The Guardian. In an interview with CNN aired at 3 p.m. on Friday, Jawlani stated, 'When we talk about objectives, the goal of the revolution remains the overthrow of this regime. It is our right to use all available means to achieve that goal.' After years of operating covertly, Jawlani has stepped into the public eye, engaging with international media and making appearances in Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city, following its capture from government forces for the first time in the civil war. Video: Assad statue toppled in Damascus after rebels seize city / Credit: Arab social media His transformation is visible in his appearance – abandoning the traditional turban associated with jihadists in favor of military attire. On Wednesday, he was seen at Aleppo's citadel wearing khaki clothing, greeting crowds from his white vehicle. Since severing ties with Al-Qaida in 2016, Jawlani has attempted to present himself as a more moderate figure. However, according to The Guardian, analysts and Western governments continue to designate Hayat Tahrir al-Sham as a terrorist organization. Thomas Pierret, a specialist in political Islam, told The Guardian, 'He is a pragmatic radical.' Pierret noted that Jawlani's extremist rhetoric peaked in 2014 when competing with ISIS, but has since moderated. Born Ahmed al-Sharaa in 1982 to an affluent family in Damascus's upscale Mazzeh district, Jawlani began signing statements under his real name during the offensive launched on November 27. In a 2021 interview with PBS, he explained that his nom de guerre referenced his family's roots in the Golan Heights, claiming his grandfather was displaced following Israel's 1967 annexation. According to Middle East Eye, Jawlani's path to extremist ideology began after the September 11, 2001 attacks. The news site reported that he attended secretive sermons in Damascus's outskirts before leaving Syria to join the fight following the US-led Iraq invasion. After joining Al-Qaida in Iraq under Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, Jawlani spent five years in detention. He returned to Syria in March 2011 amid the uprising against Assad's rule, establishing the al-Nusra Front as Syria's Al-Qaida branch. In 2013, he refused to pledge allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, instead aligning with Al-Qaida's Ayman al-Zawahiri. By May 2015, Jawlani distinguished himself from ISIS by declaring he had no intentions of attacking Western targets and promising no retribution against Assad's Alawite minority should the regime fall. After breaking from Al-Qaida to avoid Western intervention, Jawlani merged with other Islamist groups in January 2017 to form HTS, controlling parts of Idlib province. The group established a civilian administration, though the UN has classified some of its actions against dissenters as war crimes, according to The Guardian. Recently, Jawlani has addressed Aleppo's residents, including its Christian minority, promising protection under his control. He has also instructed his fighters to maintain security in newly captured areas. Aron Lund, a fellow at Century International, told The Guardian, 'The less local and international panic you have and the more Jawlani seems like a responsible actor instead of a toxic jihadi extremist, the easier his job will become. Is it totally sincere? Surely not. But it's the smart thing to say and do right now.' Throughout this process, HTS faced accusations from residents and rights groups of brutal abuses against those who dared dissent, which the UN has classed as war crimes.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/08/abu-mohammed-al-jolani-who-is-syrias-de-facto-ruler/	2024-12-07T18:30:55-08:00	
Trump credits Assad defeat to 'Israel's fighting success'	Former President Donald Trump wrote in a social media post that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad 'has fled his country,' attributing this alleged development to a dramatic realignment of power in the Middle East and Russia's shifting military priorities. Trump asserted that Iran, a key Assad ally, is in a 'weakened state because of Israel and its fighting success.' Additionally, Russia's mounting challenges in Ukraine have forced Moscow to abandon its longtime Syrian ally. 'His protector, Russia, Russia, Russia, led by Vladimir Putin, was not interested in protecting him any longer,' Trump wrote, emphasizing what he sees as a complete withdrawal of Russian support from Syria. Assad is gone. He has fled his country. His protector, Russia, Russia, Russia, led by Vladimir Putin, was not interested in protecting him any longer. There was no reason for Russia to be there in the first place. They lost all interest in Syria because of Ukraine, where close to… — Donald J. Trump Posts From His Truth Social (@TrumpDailyPosts) December 8, 2024 According to Trump's analysis, Russia's military commitments in Ukraine have reached a critical point, claiming Russian casualties amount to 'close to 600,000 soldiers lay wounded or dead, in a war that never should have started, and could go on forever.' This extensive military engagement, Trump argues, has effectively ended Russia's ability to maintain its strategic presence in Syria. 'There was no reason for Russia to be there in the first place,' Trump stated, suggesting that Moscow's intervention in Syria had become an unsustainable commitment. According to Trump's assessment, this dual weakening of Assad's primary international backers has left Syria increasingly isolated.

He expressed particular concern about the potential for escalation, warning that 'If it keeps going, it can turn into something much bigger, and far worse. Too many lives are being so needlessly wasted, too many families destroyed.' Drawing on his previous diplomatic relationships, the former president stated, 'I know Vladimir well. This is his time to act.' He concluded his message with a call for international intervention, specifically suggesting that 'China can help' and declaring, 'The World is waiting!'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/08/trump-credits-assad-defeat-to-israel-and-its-fighting-success/	2024-12-07T18:30:23-08:00

Rebels enter Homs, attack UN post in Khader	Syrian rebels announced today (Saturday) that they have taken control of the Quneitra province, near the Israeli border. However, Assad's regime has yet to confirm this claim. Reuters reported that the rebels have also entered the key city of Homs. Despite speculation online, Assad's office denies he has left Syria. Since yesterday, Syrian opposition sources have reported the capture of several towns and villages in the region. The Saudi-based Al-Arabiya channel cited sources claiming that Assad's forces have retreated from both the Quneitra province and areas they previously controlled on Mount Hermon. A Hezbollah source told AFP that the group has dispatched 2,000 fighters to the Syrian-Lebanese border near Qusayr. Reuters also reported yesterday that Hezbollah deployed oversight forces to assist Assad's army in the battle for Homs. Strategic advances by rebels across Syria The Rebels have made significant advances, seizing control of Aleppo, Hama, Daraa, and Quneitra, as well as numerous other towns and cities nationwide.

Hamas releases video of hostage Matan Zangauker	Hamas released a video this evening (Saturday night) showing a message from Matan Zangauker, exactly 14 months after the October 7 massacre. Zangauker, 24, was abducted on the morning of October 7 from Nir Oz along with his partner, Ilana Gritzewsky, who was later released in a prisoner exchange. His mother, Einav, has become one of the most prominent activists advocating for the release of the hostages, often voicing sharp criticism of the Israeli political leadership, which she accuses of sabotaging potential deals. Video: Matan speaks to his mother Einav in video from Hamas captivity. The family emphasized that the video's release is not 'psychological terror' but rather a sign of life. Einav Zangauker. Photo: Yossi Zeliger The footage was released against the backdrop of reports suggesting progress in negotiations for a hostage deal. Earlier today, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani commented on efforts for a ceasefire in Gaza, claiming that 'the differences over a hostage deal between Israel and Hamas are not substantial.' Palestinian sources told the Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper that Hamas has begun counting the hostages held by its forces and other factions in Gaza. According to these sources, the terrorist organization is working to locate Israeli hostages held by other Palestinian groups, possibly to consolidate information ahead of a potential agreement with Israel. In July, chilling footage of Zangauker was released, showing him being transported on a motorcycle through a crowded area near Khan Yunis. In the video, he is seated between two armed terrorists, while a jubilant crowd cheers at the sight of the 'Jewish prize.' The recording is believed to have been taken in the initial days after his abduction, during his transfer to a holding location.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/07/hamas-releases-video-of-hostage-matan-zangauker/	2024-12-07T08:00:48-08:00

Syrian rebels capture Hama as Assad forces retreat	Syrian military command announced Thursday that its forces had been engaged in fierce battles against rebel groups along multiple fronts in the city of Hama in recent days. Video: Intense fighting between rebels and Assad's forces in Syria's Hama. Credit: Arab media The military acknowledged sustaining casualties in recent hours. In an unusual admission, the army confirmed that rebel forces had successfully breached Hama's defenses through several access points, despite suffering losses of their own. Subsequently, the Syrian military command announced its units would conduct a 'strategic redeployment' of forces outside Hama. According to reporting by Al-Araby al-Jadeed, citing three Iraqi sources including a senior Baghdad Foreign Ministry official, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has requested direct support from Iraq to prevent additional Syrian cities from falling to rebel forces. The sources revealed that Assad conveyed this request during discussions with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani. The Iraqi parliamentary coalition subsequently convened to discuss the conversation in a session attended by al-Sudani. Pro-Iranian news channel Al Mayadeen reported ongoing confrontations approximately 2.5 miles northwest of Hama, with army reinforcements rushing to the area to counter the rebel advance. Concurrent clashes erupted 9.3 miles from Salamiyah, south of Hama. Rebel forces have deployed drones and mortar shells in their offensive against city districts. Syrian state media swiftly countered reports of rebel advances, asserting that 'all attempts to breach the Hama front have failed.' However, a humanitarian crisis looms as pharmaceutical production facilities have ceased operations, particularly affecting displaced populations who previously fled from Aleppo. Sources speaking to AlHadath news channel reported extensive Israeli strikes targeting weapons storage facilities in the northern Damascus area during the past 24 hours.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/05/syrian-rebels-capture-hama-as-assad-forces-retreat/	2024-12-05T06:15:19-08:00	
Israeli delegation to head to Cairo for hostage deal talks	The Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar reported Thursday that Egypt is awaiting the Israeli government's response to a proposed temporary ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip. Sources informed the Hezbollah-affiliated publication that Egyptian officials cautioned their Israeli counterparts during discussions that rejecting the proposal would lead to 'a dark tunnel with no hope of saving the living hostages.' The report indicated that Egyptian officials conveyed to Israeli leadership that Hamas has demonstrated flexibility during discussions with Egypt's intelligence chief in Cairo regarding the proposal. Arab media reports suggest Israel's response will come with the Israeli security delegation's visit to Cairo, which is expected in the coming days. However, the visit has reportedly been delayed due to several unresolved issues. Egyptian sources indicated the possibility of Israel securing the release of the largest number of hostages to date, partially in exchange for increased humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. The sources also noted that Egypt would serve as a guarantor for Hamas' commitment to the agreement. Chief of Shin Bet (L), the Qatari mediator, and the head of Mossad (R). Photo credit: KOKO/Gideon Markowicz/Reuters Reports indicate that officials from Qatar, Turkey, and the US conducted discussions about the hostage release process and prioritization criteria for determining which individuals would be freed. Egyptian sources expressed confidence in assurances provided by senior officials from President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration. A source close to the negotiations told Reuters that Steve Whitkoff met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed al-Thani in an effort to advance a ceasefire agreement before Trump's inauguration. The source confirmed that Qatar has resumed its role as mediator between Israel and Hamas, with a Hamas delegation expected to travel to Doha for further discussions. Arab media outlets yesterday revealed details from the draft proposal being developed in Egypt. Reports indicate that regional actors are working to adapt the Lebanese model to Gaza, aiming to establish an extended ceasefire lasting approximately two months. The emerging proposal reportedly includes a strategic redeployment of IDF forces within Gaza, rather than an immediate full withdrawal. The proposal also addresses control of the Rafah crossing, with Egyptian officials intensifying pressure on Hamas and Fatah to reach agreements regarding both a committee for Gaza Strip administration and management of the crossing. The proposed framework would transfer control of the southern Gaza crossing to the Palestinian Authority, allowing its reoperation after months of closure.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/05/israeli-delegation-to-head-to-cairo-for-hostage-deal-talks/	2024-12-05T01:56:08-08:00	
Amnesty Israel rejects accusations of genocide	Amnesty International Israel issued a statement Thursday rejecting the main findings of a report released by its global movement, which accuses Israel of committing genocide in the Gaza Strip. The report claims that Israel's actions amount to genocidal practices. However, the Israeli section of the organization has distanced itself from these conclusions, stating that while it recognizes the catastrophic scale of destruction in Gaza, it does not believe the actions meet the legal definition of genocide. The Israeli section emphasized that it neither initiated nor contributed to the report, nor did it support its operational calls. The leadership of Amnesty Israel maintains that while there are voices within the organization that believe the genocide accusation could be substantiated, the majority disagree. Despite this internal division, the organization has made it clear that these views should not be seen as a formal endorsement of the global report's conclusions. Israeli flag placed on a pile of charred vehicles burned in the bloody Oct. 7 cross-border attack by Hamas terrorists, outside the town of Netivot, southern Israel, Jan.7, 2024 (AP/Ohad Zwigenberg) AP/Ohad Zwigenberg Amnesty Israel's position is rooted in the belief that while the scale of violence is undeniable, the evidence does not meet the rigorous legal criteria for genocide, as outlined in the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. In particular, the organization points to the lack of 'specific intent' to destroy Palestinians as a group, a key element required to prove genocide. Amnesty Israel's statement concludes with a call for a comprehensive investigation into potential war crimes by all sides and an appeal for a sustainable peace agreement based on international law, which guarantees the security, freedom, and dignity of all people in the region.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/05/amnesty-israel-rejects-accusations-of-genocide-in-new-report/	2024-12-05T01:24:42-08:00

He was kidnapped from Kibbutz Be'eri on October 7, the same day his parents were killed in the Hamas attack. The recovery comes after confirmation of his death in January alongside fellow hostage Yossi Sharabi after 99 days in Hamas captivity. Shvirsky, from Tel Aviv, had visited Kibbutz Be'eri, where he grew up, on October 7 to see his divorced parents, who lived separately in the kibbutz and were both killed. Shvirsky was with his mother,r Orit, 70, when terrorists entered her room. Both were hiding under a blanket when the terrorists opened fire, killing his mother and reportedly wounding Shvirsky. At the same time, in another house in the kibbutz, his father, Rafi Shvirsky, was killed. His grandmother, Aviva Sela, 97, one of Be'eri's founders, survived miraculously, but her caregiver Grace, who protected her, was killed.

In January, Hamas released a video showing Shvirsky and Sharabi – both later killed in captivity – along with Noa Argamani, who was rescued from Gaza in June during 'Operation Arnon.' Noa Argamani paid tribute to Shvirsky, who was with her during their difficult captivity, in an Instagram story posted in July. 'You were by my side throughout the journey, and I by yours. You were my friend, my conversation partner, and the big brother I never had. You taught me about the complexity of the soul and how each of us deals with things differently, that there's no wrong way, each person has their path.

She continued: 'It's been 191 days that you're not here with me, and it still hasn't sunk in that innocent people are being murdered. All I have left to say is thank you. Thank you for being by my side all this time, thank you for listening to my fears, thank you for simply being there. I promise you'll always be a part of me, that I'll never forget you, and that I'll do my very best to give you a proper burial. I wish you knew how much we all love you. May your memory be blessed.' This week, during a protest outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem, marking one year since the hostage deal, Shvirsky's sister, Meirav, shared her feelings: 'In the week when 105 women, men and children returned, when I knew Itay wouldn't return since he was a 38-year-old man, I was surprised by the intensity of emotions I experienced. Then the stories and testimonies came, including about Itay. From that moment, with every bite, every shower, every time I laid my head on the pillow, thoughts of Itay came, and with them, feelings of guilt.'

6 hostages whose bodies were returned in August were murdered in ...	The families of six hostages whose bodies were returned to Israel in August 2024 were informed by the IDF this week that their loved ones were killed in Hamas captivity. According to military findings, the hostages – Alexander Dancyg, Yoram Metzger, Chaim Perry, Yagev Buchshtab, Nadav Popplewell, and Avraham Munder – were executed by gunfire inside a Gaza tunnel after an Israeli airstrike targeted underground infrastructure in the area. The military believes the hostages were likely killed shortly after the attack. According to a military investigation, it is likely that the Hamas terrorists guarding the hostages killed them shortly after the Israeli airstrike. The military does not rule out the possibility that other Hamas operatives may have executed the hostages, although this remains unlikely. The six Hamas terrorists who had been guarding the hostages were found dead in the tunnel, likely from asphyxiation caused by toxic gas released during the airstrike. At the time, there was no reason to suspect hostages were in the area, and the IDF did not consider the possibility when planning the strike. The results of the investigation were presented to the families, who were told that even if their loved ones had not been shot, they would have likely died from inhaling toxic fumes from the attack. Israelis rallying for the release of the hostages held by the Hamas terrorist organization in the Gaza Strip (Gideon Markowicz) Gideon Markowicz The hostages had been held in an underground facility until December 2023. After an Israeli ground operation, they were moved to a tunnel in the Hamed neighborhood, about 2.5 miles away, where their last known image was taken. On Feb. 14, 2024, the IDF conducted a targeted strike in the area without knowing that hostages were nearby. Five months later, intelligence indicated that the hostages had likely perished. In August 2024, their bodies were retrieved from the tunnel. IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi acknowledged the failure and emphasized that the mission to bring the hostages home continues. 'We are doing everything we can to bring them back. Every mistake we make is a result of a lack of information, and we must learn from them.' Noam Perry, daughter of Chaim Perry, said, 'The public must understand that military operations endanger hostages. We need to secure a deal now – there is no other way.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/04/6-hostages-whose-bodies-were-returned-in-august-were-murdered-in-captivity/	2024-12-04T07:58:45-08:00	
Israel to interdict Tehran's weapon transfers to Assad regime	Israel will prevent Iran from establishing a significant weapons supply chain to Syria aimed at bolstering President Bashar al-Assad's fight against rebel forces, Israel Hayom has learned. Israel has adopted a calculated neutrality in Syria's civil war, given that Assad's opponents, linked to al-Qaida, maintain hostility toward Israel matching that of Iran. This strategic position has led to a current policy of non-intervention. Syrians gather in the rebel-held northwestern city of Idlib in the early hours of September 28, 2024, following news claiming the death of Lebanon's Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike on Beirut's southern suburbs on September 27, 2024 (AFP/Haj Kadour) AFP/Haj Kadour However, in matters of weapons transfers, Israeli defense analysts view Syria and Lebanon as a single operational theater, concluding that Iranian-supplied armaments will ultimately target Israel. Consequently, the defense establishment has intensified its efforts to monitor and, when necessary, intercept such weapons shipments. Several Iranian supply flights bound for Syria have already been forced to turn back. Social media networks have recently been circulating footage showing substantial Iraqi military forces advancing westward, presumably toward the Syrian border. Intelligence assessments indicate that at least a portion of these forces, operating under Iranian influence, have been deployed to counter anti-regime rebel forces. The Syrian Center reported earlier today that President Bashar Assad's forces received additional reinforcements in the Hama region. Their reports indicate that Assad's army, alongside pro-Iranian militias, successfully pushed rebel factions back 6.2 miles from Hama city.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/04/israel-to-interdict-tehrans-weapons-transfers-to-assad-regime/	2024-12-04T02:31:19-08:00

However, the message did not specify when such a mission might take place.

The hostages – Alexander Dancyg, Yoram Metzger, Chaim Perry, Yagev Buchshtab, Nadav Popplewell, and Avraham Munder – were killed in a tunnel crossing, just like six other hostages who were murdered by Hamas terrorists in a Rafah tunnel: Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Ori Danino, Carmel Gat, Alexander Lobanov and Almog Sarusi.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/04/hamas-reportedly-threatens-to-execute-hostages-if-idf-attempts-rescue/	2024-12-04T00:30:24-08:00	
US report alleges 'revenge and destruction' by IDF	An investigation by The Washington Post has uncovered more than 120 photos and videos posted by Israeli soldiers during military operations in Gaza, reportedly revealing a pattern of destruction and celebratory behavior that has raised concerns about conduct during the conflict.

Syrian rebels seize Aleppo as Kurds launch eastern offensive	Syria's complex civil war entered a new phase this week as Islamic rebels consolidated their control over Aleppo, while US-backed Kurdish forces launched a separate offensive against President Bashar al-Assad's army and Iranian-backed groups in the country's eastern regions, significantly altering the conflict's dynamics. The last 24 hours have witnessed intense exchanges of fire between the Syrian Democratic Forces (a Kurdish-led coalition backed by the United States) and Assad's forces alongside pro-Iranian armed groups. Success by the Kurdish-led coalition in this arena could prove advantageous for Israel by disrupting Iranian arms supply networks. Foreign reports indicate that the Syrian Democratic Forces and the Deir ez-Zor Military Council have initiated 'Operation Return,' targeting a series of villages currently held by Assad's forces and pro-Iranian armed groups. Their declared purpose is to enable the return of residents who were previously forced from these villages. The Syrian News Agency, a media outlet aligned with the Assad government, reported that its military and 'auxiliary forces' are responding to an offensive in eastern Deir ez-Zor. The report characterized the Syrian Democratic Forces as 'terrorists belonging to a separatist militia.' In western Syria, the Islamic rebels' command center announced control over more than 15 villages and towns in northwestern Hama province, with forces advancing toward Hama city. This campaign, spearheaded by the jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, carries the name 'Deterrence of Aggression.' The northern province of Idlib has also fallen entirely under their control. Concurrently, the Syrian National Army, comprising various Islamic armed groups, some receiving Turkish support, has opened another front against the Syrian Democratic Forces. These groups are targeting Kurdish autonomous regions in northern Syria through an operation dubbed 'Dawn of Freedom,' designed to diminish Syrian Democratic Forces' influence. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government in Turkey maintains a strategic interest in reducing Kurdish power and is acting in pursuit of this objective. Recent diplomatic engagement between Turkish and Iranian foreign ministers concluded with both sides acknowledging their divergent views on Syrian developments. At a joint press conference, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated, 'it's natural we have differences.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/03/syrian-rebels-seize-aleppo-as-kurds-launch-eastern-offensive/	2024-12-02T23:00:15-08:00	
German hotel's Israeli flag display leads to surge in bookings	Schloss Elmau, one of Germany's most prestigious luxury resorts, owned by Dietmar Mueller, has established itself as a welcoming haven for Israeli visitors. Following the outbreak of war, Mueller took the decisive step of displaying the Israeli flag at the hotel's entrance while also featuring it prominently on the establishment's website. In an exclusive interview with Israel Hayom several months ago, Mueller acknowledged receiving some negative feedback from certain quarters but remained steadfast in his decision to maintain the prominent Israeli flag display at the main entrance. 'The flag stays until all hostages return home,' Mueller affirmed to Israel Hayom. Israeli flag displayed at the Schloss Elmau hotel The hotel, situated a 90-minute drive from Munich, has witnessed an unprecedented surge in Israeli bookings since the conflict began. This remarkable increase is particularly noteworthy given that pre-war travel patterns saw significantly more Israelis venturing abroad, while current travel options remain limited. Nevertheless, the resort continues to experience a substantial rise in demand from Israeli travelers. Hotel statistics reveal 438 overnight stays by Israeli guests in the initial months of this year, marking a significant increase from 185 stays recorded during the same period last year. The establishment's commitment to excellence was further recognized this week when it claimed top honors at the '101 Best Hotels in Germany' awards ceremony.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/03/german-hotels-israeli-flag-display-leads-to-surge-in-bookings/	2024-12-02T23:00:09-08:00	
Mother of Hamas-held US citizen Keith Siegel dies	The family of Keith Siegel, held by Hamas since being taken from his home in Kfar Aza during the Oct. 7 atrocities in 2023, announced the passing of his mother. In an emotional Facebook post, Siegel's daughter Ilan shared the family's anguish: 'My father's mother has passed away, and my father couldn't say goodbye to her because he has been held captive by Hamas for over a year.' The daughter recalled the horrific ordeal Siegel has had to endure since taken by the Isalmic terrorists on that fateful morning, when thousands invaded Israeli territory and killed more than 1,000 and took some 250 captive. Siegel's wife, Aviva, was among those whore returned as part of the Nov. 2023 swap with Hamas. Soldiers removing a body in Kfar Aza after the Hamas massacre (Haim Goldberg/Flash90) Haim Goldberg/Flash90 'My father was forcibly taken from his home by terrorists barely in their twenties. He's being held in dark tunnels, enduring severe hunger and both emotional and physical abuse just an hour's drive from Tel Aviv. While government officials work from secure facilities in the Kirya, he remains trapped in the most horrifying conditions imaginable, with no immediate prospect of return,' she wrote on Facebook. 'My father couldn't come to say goodbye to his mother, who can never return. My father, a man who dedicated his life to doing good, who believed in goodness and loved humanity. My father is 65 years old. Dad won't be able to stand with us tomorrow at the cemetery, he won't be able to say goodbye to the woman who raised him and loved him all his life. A violent and murderous terror organization is dictating our lives from the Gaza Strip to the great United States, and the world remains silent.' Siegel's condition is unknown. Hamas released a video in April in which they coerced him to play along with their propaganda messages aimed at pressuring Israeli decisionmakers to make a deal.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/03/mother-of-hamas-held-us-citizen-keith-siegel-dies/	2024-12-02T22:36:25-08:00	
Child's rampage through Walmart goes viral	A video of a young girl's destructive rampage through a Walmart store, which included smashing glass bottles and throwing merchandise, has garnered nearly 3 million views on social media as observers debate the appropriate response to such behavior. The incident, reported by the New York Post, shows an unsupervised child moving through multiple store sections, pulling items from shelves, and tossing them onto the floor. The situation escalated when the girl reached the store's deli counter, where she began writhing on the floor as two women attempted to intervene. 'Where is her mother – or whoever she's with?' a shopper can be heard asking in the video. Watch as this child destroys a Walmart and a white woman steps in to stop staff and other customers from restraining her while she wreaks havoc. 'Don't yet at her. Don't film her. Don't stop her. You don't know what she's going through.' pic.twitter.com/9JMJTkMckA — Ian Miles Cheong (@stillgray) December 2, 2024 The situation intensified as the child proceeded to a display of sparkling grape juice, where she deliberately shattered multiple bottles, creating hazardous conditions with broken glass and spilled liquid. When a male customer attempted to stop the destruction, an unidentified woman intercepted him, declaring, 'Don't do that to a little girl!' Throughout the incident, the same woman followed the child, warning others against intervention with the statement, 'You don't know what she's going through!' The viral footage has sparked significant online discussion about parenting and accountability. 'There's no justification for allowing your child to run rampant and destroy products in a store. This isn't a place to hold a therapy session,' one X user wrote in response to the video. Store employees, drawn by the commotion, were seen watching the scene unfold but did not directly intervene. The video concludes with an unidentified man carrying the child away over his shoulder.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/03/childs-rampage-through-walmart-goes-viral/	2024-12-02T18:00:50-08:00	
Trump: 'If the hostages are not released, there will be ALL HELL ...	President-elect Donald Trump issued a strong warning to Hamas today (Monday), addressing the terrorists holding hostages in the Gaza Strip. He emphasized that if the hostages are not released before his inauguration on January 20, severe repercussions will follow. On his social media platform, Trump wrote: 'Everybody is talking about the hostages who are being held so violently, inhumanely, and against the will of the entire World, in the Middle East - But it's all talk, and no action!' He continued: 'Please let this TRUTH serve to represent that if the hostages are not released prior to January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume Office as President of the United States, there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against Humanity. Donald Trump (Archive). Photo: AFP Trump added: 'Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America.

Iran hackers posed as Israeli officials in plot targeting leaders	The Shin Bet security agency revealed Monday that it has detected roughly 200 Iranian-orchestrated cyberattacks targeting Israeli citizens, including high-ranking public officials and notable public figures, such as attorney Yossi Fuchs. A senior Shin Bet official characterized the campaign as a significant escalation in Iran's ongoing operations against Israel, specifically designed to enable assassination attempts. In a detailed briefing, the security service disclosed that it had identified an extensive Iranian phishing operation in recent months. The targets included senior defense establishment figures, political leadership, academic researchers, media professionals, journalists, and other prominent individuals. The sophisticated campaign sought to compromise targets' digital footprint – including email accounts, computers, and mobile devices – with the ultimate goal of harvesting sensitive personal information. The attackers particularly focused on gathering residential addresses, personal connections, and routine location data. According to security officials, this intelligence was intended to support Iranian-directed operations within Israel, potentially executed through locally recruited cells. The Shin Bet and Israel Police have successfully prevented nine separate attempts by Iranian operators to recruit Israeli citizens for such operations in recent months. The cyber operatives typically initiated contact through WhatsApp, Telegram, or email communications. Each approach was meticulously crafted with a personalized cover story matching the target's professional sphere, designed to appear legitimate and avoid triggering suspicion. The technical aspect of the operation involved two primary attack vectors: persuading targets to download malware-infected applications or directing them to sophisticated phishing websites that mimicked legitimate services. These fake sites prompted targets to enter their email credentials, allowing the attackers to harvest login information and gain unauthorized access to their email accounts. Following the discovery of this campaign and a comprehensive investigation that revealed its full scope and identified compromised individuals, the Shin Bet initiated a large-scale notification operation. This included alerting affected citizens, providing detailed security briefings, and issuing guidance on enhanced cybersecurity measures and personal safety protocols.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/02/iran-hackers-posed-as-israeli-official-in-plot-targeting-leaders/	2024-12-02T05:26:25-08:00	
NYT: Israel built military bases in Gaza	According to a report based on satellite imagery analyzed by The New York Times, Israel has significantly expanded its military footprint in central Gaza, building fortified bases and demolishing hundreds of buildings in recent months, suggesting possible plans for extended control in the region. Israeli forces have transformed a four-mile road known as the Netzarim corridor into an 18-square-mile controlled territory that divides the Gaza Strip. The military has demolished over 600 buildings since early September to create a buffer zone while rapidly expanding a network of bases with defensive fortifications. Twelve of these bases were either built or expanded since early September, indicating an accelerating pace of construction. 'Anything that has been built there can be taken down within a day,' Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli military spokesman, said in an interview with The New York Times. The alleged bases demonstrate a significant investment in infrastructure, featuring paved grounds, walls, barracks, access roads, and parking for armored vehicles. Many are fortified with defensive ditches and mounds to obstruct vehicles, suggesting a long-term presence despite official statements to the contrary. Israeli tanks patrol near the border with the Gaza Strip in southern Israel, 07 January 2024. Photo credit: EPA/Abir Sultan EPA The New York Times claims to have verified 11 drone videos showing the systematic demolition of buildings in the area, providing bird's-eye views of Israel's efforts to remake the geography south of Gaza City. Lt. Col. Shoshani told The New York Times that some of the demolished buildings had been used by Hamas as lookout posts and hiding places. This way, Hamas terrorists would now be less likely to sneak up on Israeli soldiers patrolling the Netzarim corridor or Israeli outposts, Israeli analysts said. The corridor, stretching from the Israeli border to the Mediterranean Sea, enables Israel to regulate movement across Gaza, keeping displaced Palestinians in the south. The controlled area spans roughly 4.3 miles wide and 4.3 miles long. The development comes as Netanyahu has ruled out renewed Jewish settlement in Gaza for now, despite calls from some ministers. The Israeli military presence in the area stems from its campaign against Hamas following the deadly Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, in which approximately 1,200 people were killed – mostly civilians – and 250 taken hostage.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/02/nyt-israel-built-military-bases-in-gaza/	2024-12-02T01:00:56-08:00	
Israel confirms covert hostage negotiations underway	Israeli officials have broken their silence about ongoing confidential negotiations regarding a potential hostage deal, with sources noting that the remarkable absence of leaks – barring minor reports – suggests a serious commitment to the diplomatic process by all parties involved. Sources close to the negotiations emphasize that reaching an agreement will require increased flexibility from both sides. While Hamas has demonstrated some willingness to compromise, questions remain about whether the Israeli government will show similar diplomatic elasticity. Israeli negotiators disclosed that while current talks are proceeding in Egypt without direct Israeli participation, the negotiating team remains fully briefed and engaged in the backstage proceedings. 'There isn't a concrete proposal currently on the table,' one source revealed, 'but new ideas are emerging that we hope will lead to a deal. Hamas' increasing isolation from Hezbollah's support on the northern front has been a contributing factor.'

IDF confirms Iranian-led forces sent against Syria rebels	Iraqi forces backed by Iran have moved into Syria to support the government's efforts to counter insurgents who recently captured parts of Aleppo, according to the IDF and monitoring groups, marking an escalation in the regional conflict. IDF Spokesperson Daniel Hagari told Sky News on Monday that the movement of the Iranian proxies into Syria from Iraq to help the Syrian regime was noted just hours after Israeli officials expressed concern over such a development. 'The Iranian regime is sending reinforcements of forces to Syria, and Israel will prevent Iranian weapons from reaching Syria. Iran has sent dozens of fighters by air to Syria from Iraqi militias loyal to it and from the Revolutionary Guards,' Hagari said. The deployment, reported by The Associated Press, comes as opposition fighters led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham launched a significant offensive last week, pushing into areas around Idlib and Hama provinces while seizing portions of Aleppo, Syria's largest city. Government forces have established defensive positions in northern Hama as they work to halt the opposition's momentum, while airstrikes targeted rebel positions on Sunday, AP reported.

'I clearly announced full-fledged support to President Assad, government, army, and people of Syria by the Islamic Republic of Iran,' Araghchi said, according to AP. After the Damascus meeting, he traveled to Ankara for discussions with Turkish officials, who have supported opposition groups. An Iraqi militia official, speaking to AP on condition of anonymity due to lack of authorization to address the media, confirmed that Tehran-aligned Iraqi forces already in Syria had mobilized, with additional units crossing the border to support Assad's forces. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitoring group, reported that approximately 200 Iraqi fighters in pickup trucks entered Syria through the Bou Kamal border crossing overnight. These forces are expected to deploy to Aleppo to assist in the Syrian army's counter-offensive, the monitor told AP. Meanwhile, Syrian and Russian forces continued aerial bombardment of opposition positions, primarily in Hama and Idlib provinces. The Syrian Civil Defense reported at least 10 civilian casualties in Idlib city and surrounding areas. In the north, Kurdish civilians fled as Turkish-backed opposition forces captured Tel Rifaat from US-supported Kurdish authorities. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces largely withdrew from the area and requested humanitarian corridors to facilitate safe passage of civilians toward Aleppo and eventually to Kurdish-controlled northeastern regions.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/02/idf-confirms-iranian-led-forces-sent-to-repel-syrian-rebels/	2024-12-02T00:38:53-08:00	
IDF says Israeli-American hostage Omer Neutra was killed on Oct. ...	The IDF announced Monday morning that Israeli-American hostage Cpt. Omer Neutra, captured during Hamas' Oct. 7 assault on southern Israel, was killed in action that day. The announcement comes after extensive analysis of intelligence and evidence gathered since the attack, according to the Military Rabbinate. Neutra, whose body is being held by Hamas, commanded a strategic position near Nir Oz and led the first response forces against the pre-dawn invasion. His tank came under heavy fire from a large contingent of Hamas terrorists, resulting in the deaths of two crew members. Neutra and fellow soldier Nimrod Cohen were captured in the assault. In an interview with Israel Hayom earlier this month, his family revealed their journey from Israel to America two decades ago, where they established an international laboratory research enterprise. Omer and his younger brother Daniel, 20, were born and raised in the United States, immersed in both Jewish tradition and pluralistic values as part of a Conservative Jewish community. The family's world was shattered on Oct. 7 when footage emerged showing their son being pulled from his burning tank. 'We want people to know Omer,' his mother Orna said. 'At 18, he went to Israel for a gap year program and discovered his true calling. He realized that simply feeling love for Israel wasn't enough – he needed to take action.' Despite having secured university admission, Neutra chose to enlist in the IDF. 'We supported his decision completely. He joined the Armored Corps and quickly rose to a command position.' Their final conversation took place on Oct. 6. 'Omer told us they had reduced the alert level for Simchat Torah, suggesting a quieter holiday ahead,' Orna recalls. 'He was commanding an armored position near Nir Oz, with two tanks and several Golani Brigade infantry soldiers under his command. The weeks before had been intense with frequent border incidents, so we were relieved he would have some respite.' The next morning brought devastating news as Hamas launched its unprecedented attack. All contact was lost with Omer. After an agonizing night, the family received footage showing their son's capture from his destroyed tank. Since that moment, they have been living through what his mother described as an 'unending nightmare.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/02/idf-says-israeli-american-hostage-omer-neutra-was-killed-on-oct-7/	2024-12-02T00:23:59-08:00	
In battle and captivity: Tank Crew 3 tragic fate on Oct. 7	The story of Tank Crew 3 encapsulates the tragic events of Oct. 7. On Monday, the IDF confirmed that its commander, 22-year-old Capt Omer Neutra from Long Island, was killed and his body taken captive. His crew – three teenage soldiers barely out of high school – shared the same fate, marking one of the darkest chapters in Israel's recent history. Tank Crew 3 was led by Capt Omer Neutra, commanding three 19-year-old soldiers: Cpl Nimrod Cohen as gunner, Sgt Oz Daniel as radio operator-loader, and Sgt Shaked Dahan as driver. The crew was assigned to Battalion 77 of the 7th Brigade, positioned near the White House Outpost between the kibbutzim of Nirim and Nir Oz. In conversations with their families, they described grueling shifts in their tank, sometimes lasting up to 18 hours. Gazans take control of an Israeli tank after crossing the Photo credit: Said Khatib/AFP AFP When Hamas launched its surprise attack on Oct. 7, the crew immediately mobilized to defend their sector. However, their tank experienced a critical malfunction – reportedly a brake failure – that left them vulnerable. This mechanical failure allowed Hamas terrorists to approach the tank, plant explosives, and capture all four members. During testimony before the civilian inquiry commission, Nimrod Cohen's parents unveiled a series of operational failures that culminated in their son's capture. They described severe technical issues with the tank, noting that 'the brakes locked up, reducing the tank's speed to 5 mph – merely walking pace,' which made it an easy target for Hamas fighters to disable. Yehuda Cohen, Nimrod's father, painted a disturbing picture of operational negligence at the border position. He described soldiers waiting exposed at their posts for tank carriers to arrive, widespread equipment maintenance issues, and personnel walking their posts without weapons. 'The atmosphere resembled a summer camp,' he testified, 'reflecting leadership's misguided message that everything was under control.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/02/in-battle-and-captivity-tank-crew-3-tragic-fate-on-oct-7/	2024-12-01T23:25:07-08:00	
Israeli assessment: Assad allows Iranian forces into Syria	The Syrian rebel offensive, spearheaded by Tahrir al-Sham, a rebel group supported by Turkey, commenced on Wednesday.
