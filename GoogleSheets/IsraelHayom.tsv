Families of American Oct. 7 victims file lawsuit against Iran	The families of American victims who were murdered in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel, along with families of American-Israeli soldiers killed during subsequent military operations in Gaza, have filed a lawsuit against Iran in a US federal court. According to The New York Times, the lawsuit accuses Tehran of providing crucial support for what the plaintiffs describe as the deadliest attack on Jews since the Holocaust, including direct funding for what Hamas leaders internally called 'the big project.' The lawsuit, filed in the US District Court in Washington, outlines Iran's extensive financing network supporting Hamas and details Tehran's backing of other terror organizations committed to Israel's destruction. The case builds its foundation, in part, on recently captured Hamas documents discovered in Gaza and subsequently published in media reports. The plaintiffs' legal team has secured original documents revealing a crucial December 2022 clandestine planning meeting of Hamas' political and military leadership. During this high-level gathering, Yahya Sinwar, then Hamas' Gaza chief, sought an additional $7 million in monthly funding from Iran's Revolutionary Guards to finance what would become the Oct. 7 attack, cryptically referred to in documents as 'the big project.' Families gather at the White House to advocate for their relatives held hostage by Hamas in Gaza. Photo credit: AFP AFP According to The New York Times, the lawsuit highlights the Revolutionary Guards' critical role in orchestrating coordination between Hamas and Hezbollah during attack preparations. All organizations named in the lawsuit – Hamas, Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – have been designated as foreign terrorist organizations by the US. The Oct. 7 attack claimed the lives of 46 Americans, including children. Hamas took approximately 250 people hostage, among them 12 Americans. While seven Americans remain in Gaza, three have been declared dead. The legal action also encompasses Americans killed in combat operations in Gaza or along Israel's northern front. More than 30 American-Israeli citizens lost their lives while serving in the IDF. Among those fallen was Moshe Leiter, 39, a reservist serving in an elite naval unit. His father, Dr. Yechiel Leiter, is slated to become Israel's ambassador to the US next year. The American casualties included Danielle Waldman, 24, a Palo Alto, California native. She and her boyfriend were among at least 360 people killed at the Nova music festival on Oct. 7, 2023. Evidence suggests she was ambushed in her vehicle, later found with multiple bullet holes and bearing bloodstains. According to The New York Times, the plaintiffs seek damages under both the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and the PATRIOT Act. The case is being pursued by a team of prominent attorneys, including Gary M. Osen, known for representing Nazi victims, and Lee Wolosky. American courts have seen numerous lawsuits against Iran by terror victims over the years. Iran consistently fails to appear in its defense, typically resulting in default judgments for the plaintiffs.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/18/families-of-american-oct-7-victims-file-lawsuit-against-iran/	2024-11-17T23:00:37-08:00	
Biden meets with families of Israeli-American hostages	President Joe Biden met Thursday with families of Israeli Americans held hostage by the Hamas terror group in the Gaza Strip Thursday, 'reaffirmed the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to getting the hostages home to their loved ones and families,' the White House announced in a statement. 'The administration has worked tirelessly to get a deal done as soon as possible to bring the hostages home, and the president also assured the families those efforts will continue,' the statement said.

Erdogan: 'We must push Israel into a corner'	Turkey's President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, addressed relations with Israel today (Wednesday) and stated that there should be a complete break in trade relations with the Jewish state. 'Undoubtedly, Turkey dealt a hard blow to Israel by halting commercial activities with it,' the Turkish president said. Erdogan made these remarks in a speech at the climate summit in Azerbaijan, adding that 'coordinated diplomatic efforts must be used to push Israel into a corner.' He noted that it is too soon to determine whether Trump will act to reduce the risk of regional war in the Middle East. Photo: AFP Erdogan has reiterated similar statements in the past, likely due to mounting pressure on him to completely halt trade with Israel after Turkish traders found alternative routes to transfer goods to the Jewish state. More critically, Erdogan is under substantial pressure to stop the flow of oil from Azerbaijan to Israel, but so far he has refrained from taking that step.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/13/erdogan-we-must-push-israel-into-a-corner/	2024-11-13T05:00:52-08:00	
PIJ releases video of hostage Sasha Trufanov	The Islamic Jihad terrorist organization released a video today (Wednesday) ofSasha Trufanov, who was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7. Israel Hayom will not publish Trufanov's video, and will not cooperate with the psychological terror tactics of terrorist organizations. In the video, Troponov speaks of his longing for his friends and family, and he asks the public to remember him and the other hostages. He also states that his life is in danger. This is the third video released by the terrorist organization featuring Troponov, who has been in captivity for 404 days and celebrated his 29th birthday in captivity yesterday. Troponov was abducted from his parents' home in Nir Oz along with his mother Lena, his grandmother Irina, and his girlfriend Sapir and taken to Gaza. Lena, Irina, and Sapir were freed after 54 days in captivity—but Sasha remains in Gaza.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/13/pij-releases-video-of-hostage-sasha-trufanov/	2024-11-13T01:30:57-08:00	
Iran building new tunnel in Tehran due to Israel strikes	Iran has launched construction of what it describes as a 'defensive tunnel' in central Tehran, according to a Tuesday report by the Tasnim news agency, with officials citing recent Israeli strikes on Iranian territory as the impetus for the project. The underground passage, located in the city's center, will link a major metropolitan transit station to Khomeini Hospital, providing protected subterranean access to medical care in the event of aerial attacks on the capital's streets. Israeli soldier standing next to a ballistic missile retrieved from the Dead Sea after Iran launched drones and missiles toward Israel, April 16, 2024 (Reuters/Amir Cohen) Reuters/Amir Cohen Speaking to Tasnim, which is known for its close ties to Iran's conservative establishment, Tehran's transportation chief emphasized the unprecedented nature of the project: 'This marks the first time in our nation's history that we're constructing a civilian tunnel for preparedness purposes in the capital.' The tunneling initiative reflects Iran's broader strategy of underground fortification, which it has deployed extensively to protect its nuclear program, ballistic missile capabilities, and air force assets. Tehran has recently showcased multiple documentation of its subterranean infrastructure, including footage of underground ballistic missile storage and launch facilities, as well as a substantial underground air base housing combat aircraft. While Iran cites this civilian project as a response to Israeli actions, it bears noting that during last month's retaliatory strikes, Israel exclusively targeted facilities associated with Iran's military industrial complex and security forces, with no civilian installations among the targets.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/12/iran-building-new-tunnel-in-heart-of-tehran-due-to-israel-strikes/	2024-11-11T23:50:44-08:00	
Israel to expand Gaza aid zones as US deadline nears	A joint memorandum from Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, delivered to Israel's senior cabinet members, outlined potential weapons transfer restrictions if Israel fails to ease humanitarian aid restrictions to Gaza within the designated timeframe. The US administration's comprehensive demands include a significant expansion of the humanitarian zone in Muwasi, a substantial increase in daily aid deliveries to 350 trucks, renewed engagement with UNRWA, and facilitation of Red Cross access to Hamas detainees. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin during their meeting at the Kirya in Tel Aviv Kobi Gideon / GPO Responding to these pressures, the IDF has announced plans to expand humanitarian access zones in Muwasi, encompassing additional northern and eastern sectors. Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer is preparing a formal response indicating Israel's commitment to gradually scaling up aid truck volumes from the current 150-200 daily deliveries to meet the US target of 350 within weeks. The most contentious point remains Israel's stance on UNRWA, following recent legislation barring official contact with the UN agency's personnel due to their complicity in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attacks. However, senior Israeli sources suggest Washington might be willing to show flexibility on this issue if Israel demonstrates substantial progress on other humanitarian measures.

Saudi crown prince leads Riyadh summit with sharp rebuke of Israe...	At Monday's Arab-Islamic summit in Riyadh, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman delivered a pointed critique of Israel's actions, reaffirming his nation's opposition to the military campaign in Gaza. 'The Kingdom stands firmly against any diminishment of the Palestinian Authority's role and violations of Lebanese sovereignty,' bin Salman declared, adding that Saudi Arabia 'categorically rejects any interference with humanitarian operations in Gaza.' He emphasized the Palestinian Authority's qualifications for full UN membership and notably expressed opposition to attacks on Iranian territory. The gathering drew an unprecedented assembly of regional leaders, including Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and Jordan's King Abdullah. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati, and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas were among the approximately 50 Arab and Islamic leaders present at the conference. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas addresses the Turkish parliament during an extraordinary session on August 15, 2024 in Ankara, Turkey. Photo credit: Serdar Ozsoy/Getty Images Getty Images Convened to build upon previous diplomatic initiatives, the summit aimed to advance ceasefire efforts in Gaza and Lebanon while addressing the pressing need for expanded humanitarian aid delivery. The leaders also discussed recent developments in Israel's conflicts with Hamas and Hezbollah. Palestinian Authority President Abbas used the platform to advocate for his government's full UN membership bid. He called for Israel to 'end the occupation within a year by the International Court of Justice decision' and urged the international community to reassess their diplomatic ties with Israel. Abbas pushed for the suspension of Israel's UN membership, citing violations of international law, and emphasized the necessity of implementing UN Security Council resolutions 'to halt Israeli aggression in Gaza.' The summit reached its crescendo with Turkish President Erdogan's forceful address, calling for both an arms embargo against Israel and a halt to trade relations. His speech included sharp criticism of the Israeli parliament's recent decision to terminate UNRWA operations within Israeli territory.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/11/saudi-crown-prince-leads-riyadh-summit-with-sharp-rebuke-of-israel/	2024-11-11T00:00:13-08:00	
Footage of Hamas brutally interrogating Gazans uncovered	The IDF has discovered thousands of hours of surveillance footage documenting Hamas terrorists torturing Palestinian civilians at a military facility in northern Gaza, according to reporting from The Mail on Sunday. The videos – found on computers seized from a compound in the Jabalia refugee camp – show disturbing scenes of systematic abuse between 2018 and 2020. The footage reveals prisoners, hooded and chained, being subjected to various forms of torture while their captors appear casual and indifferent. 'The IDF found these CCTV images in March. It took months to go through them all,' a senior Israeli military source told The Mail. In multiple recordings, prisoners are shown with sacks covering their heads, restrained to floors and ceilings. One sequence depicts a guard reclining in a chair while a prisoner hangs by his arms from the ceiling. Another shows a hooded prisoner in chains, barely able to touch the ground with one foot, before being choked by his captor. Hamza Howidy, 27, who fled Gaza after being detained for protesting against Hamas, described his experience to The Mail. 'They would torture you until you broke and say whatever it is they wanted,' he said. 'I could hear my fellow protesters scream in the next room.' According to Howidy, who escaped through the Egyptian border in September last year, one detainee was tortured three times weekly for three years. 'You would never get a lawyer and your family would have no idea what happened to you. I was lucky because my family paid a price for me,' he said. Human rights organizations have long documented Hamas' abuse of civilians. Amnesty International published a 44-page report highlighting a campaign of abductions, torture, and killings following the 2014 conflict. A former Israeli intelligence officer, identified as Guy C, told The Mail that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who was eliminated by the IDF last month, was 'obsessed with finding collaborators and held thousands against their will.' The officer detailed brutal torture methods, saying, 'They have been known to melt plastic over skin, electric cables on their body. Some are electrocuted on electricity pylons or dragged on a chain from a vehicle until they die.' Palestinian Ahmed Fouad Alkharib, now a fellow at the Atlantic Council think-tank in the US, said, 'Extreme torture has been a fundamental component of Hamas' governance strategy to ensure they deter people and instill fear in those who speak out.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/10/footage-of-hamas-brutally-interrogating-gazans-uncovered/	2024-11-10T00:00:17-08:00	
Iraq to 'legalize child rape,' lowering age of consent to 9	Iraq's parliament is preparing to pass legislation that would lower the legal age of consent from 18 to nine years old, while simultaneously removing women's rights to divorce, child custody, and inheritance, The Telegraph reports. The amendment, backed by a coalition of conservative Shia Muslim parties, would overturn the country's 'personal status law,' also known as Law 188, which has been considered among the most progressive women's rights in the Middle East since its introduction in 1959. 'The amendment would not just undermine these rights,' said Sarah Sanbar, Iraq researcher at Human Rights Watch. 'It would erase them.' Iraq is legalizing child marriage and lowering the age of consent to just 9. Iraqi women's rights activist risks her life and confronts an iman who sponsored the bill. 'You're following Muhamad who married 9-year-old Aisha 1400 years ago. That is not normal in today's world!' pic.twitter.com/JnpUT3RUF5 — Dr. Maalouf ‏ (@realMaalouf) November 9, 2024 Previous attempts to change the law failed in 2014 and 2017 due to backlash from Iraqi women. However, according to experts interviewed by The Telegraph, the coalition now holds a large parliamentary majority and appears poised to succeed. The Iraqi parliament will formally debate the latest amendments before putting them to a vote. 'It's the closest it's ever been. It has more momentum than it's ever had, primarily because of the Shia parties,' Dr. Renad Mansour, a senior research fellow at Chatham House, said. The proposed amendment is part of a wider political move by Shia Islamist groups to 'consolidate their power' and regain legitimacy. 'Stressing the religious side is a way for them to try and regain some of the ideological legitimacy that has been waning over the last few years,' he explained. A woman wearing a hijab walks in Algeria, on February 14, 2010 (Photo: Reuters/Louafi Larbi ) REUTERS According to the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), approximately 28% of women in Iraq are already married by age 18. A current loophole allows religious leaders to officiate marriages, including those involving girls as young as 15, with paternal permission. These unregistered marriages are particularly widespread in economically poor, ultra-conservative Shia communities. The amendment would legitimize these religious marriages, putting young girls at increased risk of sexual and physical violence. Additionally, these women 'will have to stay in harmful situations because they fear losing custody of their children,' Sanbar said. The proposed amendment would also give Muslim citizens the option to choose between the current secular personal status law or religious law based on their sect. However, in dispute cases, the husband's sect would take precedence. 'It's explicitly written in the draft that when there's a dispute between the couple, the sect of the husband takes priority,' Sanbar said. 'This is going to remove a lot of protections for women... it will undermine the principle of equality before the law.' Athraa Al-Hassan, international human rights legal adviser and director of Model Iraqi Woman, expressed fear that Iraq's system of governance could be replaced with the Guardianship of the Jurist – a Shia system placing religious rule above the state. The system is similar to Afghanistan and Iran, where a Guardian Jurist is the supreme leader. 'What they aspire to in parliament is not in the interest of society, but their personal interest,' Al-Hassan told The Telegraph. 'Iraq is a civilized civil state that cannot be otherwise. The first female minister in the Arab countries was Iraqi and the first female judge was Iraqi,' said Al-Hassan. 'We aspire to progress, not regress.' The action has sparked protests in Baghdad and other cities, organized by Coalition 188, an Iraqi group of female activists opposed to amending the personal status law. The action has sparked an outcry on social media, with women's rights activists accusing the government of trying to 'legalize child rape.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/10/iraq-to-legalize-child-rape-lowering-age-of-consent-to-9/	2024-11-09T23:00:08-08:00	
Warming ties? Saudi Chief of Staff visits Iran	Saudi armed forces general chief of staff, Fayyad al-Ruwaili, arrived in Tehran today (Sunday) leading a high-ranking military delegation. General al-Ruwaili met with his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Bagheri, to discuss bilateral relations and security cooperation. According to the Tasnim News Agency, Bagheri has previously held phone conversations with Saudi Defense Minister Khalid bin Salman, during which they discussed regional developments and efforts to strengthen security cooperation between the two countries' armed forces. Last month, Iran and Saudi Arabia conducted a joint naval exercise in the Gulf of Oman. The exercise was described by the Saudi Defense Ministry as an important step in bolstering relations between the two sides. For years, there was a rift between the countries stemming from the Arab Spring protests and Saudi Arabia's treatment of its Shia minority. In 2023, diplomatic relations between the two nations were restored.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/10/warming-ties-saudi-chief-of-staff-visits-iran/	2024-11-09T22:00:04-08:00	
Who is Hamas considering as Sinwar's successor?	Sources told the Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-awsat on Saturday that Hamas is inclined to choose Khalil al-Hayya, Yahya Sinwar's deputy, as the next head of its general Political Bureau. The sources indicated that the organization would select al-Hayya 'if conditions allow for the selection of a new personality to lead the bureau.' Other potential candidates discussed since Sinwar's elimination include Khaled Mashal, the former bureau chief, and Mohammed Ismail Darwish, head of the advisory Shura Council, who previously competed against Sinwar for the terror organization's leadership.

Photo credit: AP/Khalil Hamra AP Following the elimination of former bureau chiefs Ismail Haniyeh and Yahya Sinwar, the terror organization operates under a 'joint leadership.' According to foreign reports, this leadership comprises a council of five senior officials: Mashal as head of overseas operations, Khalil al-Hayya as head of the Gaza bureau, Mohammed Ismail Darwish as head of the Shura Council, Zaher Jabarin as head of the West Bank division, and Nizar Awadallah, a member of the Political Bureau in Gaza. Most of them are currently abroad. Last month, Arab media reported that Hamas discussed concealing the identity of its next bureau chief, apparently due to 'security challenges imposed on Hamas.' Sources emphasized that this measure would provide the new senior official with operational flexibility and complicate Israel's efforts to eliminate the terror organization's leadership. They claimed, 'This step will enable smoother operations and maintain order and cohesion within Hamas.' Meanwhile, a senior Hamas source told Asharq Al-awsat that the terror organization has not received any request from Qatar to leave Doha. However, he said they learned of an American request on the matter. According to him, Hamas became aware of the American request and increasing pressure for its removal from Qatar, but the Qatari government has not asked anything of the terror organization's leaders. 'This has happened several times before,' the source said, 'it appears to be a form of American pressure to force Hamas to make concessions in the Gaza ceasefire negotiations.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/10/who-is-hamas-considering-as-sinwars-successor/	2024-11-09T20:00:22-08:00	
IDF disputes Gaza famine warning: 'Every IPC forecast to date has...	The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), the global benchmark for hunger monitoring, has signaled the emergence of 'catastrophic' conditions in northern Gaza, warning that famine either exists or is imminent without immediate action. The critical alert, issued Saturday, comes as the US explicitly warns it might reconsider weapons deliveries if Israel fails to improve humanitarian conditions in northern Gaza. The report describes northern Gaza's situation as an 'emergency' with more than 130,000 people facing 'catastrophic conditions regarding food access,' noting that access to food and health services has plummeted since Israel resumed military operations in the area and ordered civilian evacuation, with aid supplies reportedly stranded in the Jabalia combat zone. The assessment also documents IDF operations' impact on medical and civilian infrastructure. While the report references Coordinations of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) data indicating October saw the lowest aid delivery since the war began, COGAT officials contest these findings. 'Every IPC forecast has proven inconsistent with conditions on the ground' 'Every IPC forecast to date has proven inaccurate and inconsistent with conditions on the ground, with reports repeatedly predicting decline only to later document improvement. The researchers unfortunately rely on skewed, incomplete data and sources on the ground with narrow interests. These reports have systematically drawn from organizations with vested interests and partial, imprecise information, severely undermining their reliability. Israel has issued detailed documentation of factual and methodological flaws in previous reports, which remain unaddressed.' COGAT maintains there are no aid quantity restrictions and emphasizes the IDF's extensive efforts to facilitate aid delivery to combat zones. 'IPC reports through October actually showed steady improvement in Gaza's food security. The latest report indicated that conditions as of early October, including in the north, were at their best since the war's onset.' 'The IDF, via COGAT, regularly evaluates Gaza's humanitarian situation, including the north, drawing on multiple sources, including humanitarian organizations active in northern Gaza. We adjust and expand humanitarian response accordingly. Trucks carrying humanitarian aid cross into the Gaza Strip from Erez crossing in southern Israel, Monday, Oct. 21, 2024. Photo credit: AP/Tsafrir Abayov AP 'Aid reaches northern Gaza directly through East and West Erez crossings, established in May specifically to support northern Gaza. The Erez crossings alone can process over 600 trucks weekly, with capacity for additional coordination, and no aid quantity limits exist. Since early October, northern Gaza has received more than 600 aid trucks, even as the IDF conducts intensive operations against terror organizations embedded within civilian areas. 'To minimize combat impact on remaining civilians, we issued advance evacuation notices southward, coordinated humanitarian team movements, evacuated hundreds of patients and medical staff from northern Gaza hospitals, and delivered hundreds of food, water, and medical supply packages. Over 50,000 liters of fuel and medical supplies reached northern Gaza medical facilities to sustain critical services. Last week, despite intensive operations in Jabalia and Beit Hanoun, Israel facilitated aid convoy coordination for civilians remaining in combat zones.' UNRWA Secretary-General Philippe Lazzarini issued a sharp rebuke to Israel following the alert: 'This comes as no surprise. Famine is likely present in northern Gaza – a man-made famine. Israel is wielding starvation as a weapon,' Lazzarini stated on social media. The alert's timing coincides with explicit US warnings that failing to improve northern Gaza's humanitarian conditions could affect weapons supplies to Israel. Reports last week indicated Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed dissatisfaction with current measures during discussions with then-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/10/idf-disputes-gaza-famine-warning-every-ipc-forecast-to-date-has-proven-inaccurate/	2024-11-09T20:00:08-08:00	
Qatar will cease mediation in hostage negotiations, ceasefire tal...	Qatar will halt its attempts to broker a ceasefire agreement in Gaza until Hamas and Israel demonstrate 'sincere readiness' to resume talks, a senior Qatari official stated today (Saturday) to Reuters. Recently, Qatar informed senior Hamas officials that they must leave the country, after concluding that the political office Hamas maintains in Doha 'no longer serves its purpose,' according to the official, a move seen as a significant blow to the terrorist organization. Alongside the United States and Egypt, Qatar has played a crucial role in multiple rounds of ceasefire negotiations regarding the conflict in Gaza. The most recent round of talks, held in mid-October, ended without an agreement, with Hamas rejecting a short-term ceasefire proposal. Senior Hamas official Khaled Mashal speaking during a speech in Doha, Qatar (Archive). Photo: AP 'The Qataris have stated since the beginning of the conflict that they can only mediate if both sides show a genuine interest in finding a resolution,' the official told Reuters, adding that Qatar has notified Hamas, Israel, and the US of its decision. The United States had informed Qatar several weeks ago that the continued presence of Hamas leadership in Doha was no longer acceptable, especially following the terrorist organization's rejection of the recent proposal for a ceasefire and hostage exchange agreement, a US official said on Friday. According to a CNN report today (Saturday), the final push for Qatar to agree to expel Hamas leaders from its territory came after the murder of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, an American citizen. However, three Hamas sources cited by the Saudi channel Al Arabiya denied that Qatar had informed the terrorist organization's leadership that they are no longer welcome in the country.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/09/qatar-will-cease-mediation-in-hostage-negotiations-and-ceasefire-talks-in-gaza/	2024-11-09T08:19:09-08:00	
The Trump Effect? Qatar demands Hamas leadership to leave	The United States informed Qatar that it no longer finds the presence of Hamas's leadership in the country acceptable, prompting Doha to demand that the organization's leaders depart, according to a report from Reuters. According to the report, citing a senior government source, the decision was made following Hamas leadership's firm rejection of a partial hostage deal and a temporary ceasefire as part of ongoing negotiations with Israel. Qatari authorities reportedly instructed Hamas leaders to prepare to leave the country within 10 days. President Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania.

The oil-rich emirate, which maintains strong ties with both Iran and Western nations, has become a key ally of Hamas and its rule over Gaza. Experts speculate that Hamas leaders will likely relocate to Turkey, with parts of the organization's infrastructure possibly having already moved since October 7. They also believe that some senior Hamas figures may seek refuge in Tehran, despite the recent assassination of Hamas political bureau head Ismail Haniyeh in the Iranian capital.

Father of hostage writes open letter to Trump	Dear President-elect Donald Trump, the next leader of the United States of America, As you assume once again the mantle of the presidency and leadership of the free world, I write to you with an urgent purpose. The world watches you today with a shared conviction that good must triumph over global evil. Your previous tenure demonstrated that appeasement of malevolent forces serves only to embolden them. As a fellow believer in the Republican tradition, you understand that national strength alone can safeguard a nation's citizens. In your victory speech, you mentioned your family and their support throughout your campaign and beyond. I wanted to tell you a bit about my family and about my son Eitan, who is still held captive in Gaza. Video: Donald Trump's victory speech / Credit: Washington Examiner We live in Kiryat Arba, near Hebron – a name I know resonates in America, where several cities share this biblical designation. Each day brings renewed anxiety for Eitan's safety, tempered with profound pride in his actions. When terror struck on October 7, he chose to help others escape rather than seek his own safety, saving dozens before being taken captive in the afternoon hours. This exemplifies his character – Eitan has always been someone who assists others, whether through attentive listening, concrete action, or wise counsel. Our family's sole wish is to have Eitan home before his captivity reaches 400 days. His young sisters, aged five and eight, maintain a vigil of hope, decorating our front door with drawings awaiting his return. Zvika Mor, father of hostage Eitan Mor (Photo: Liron Moldovan) Liron Moldovan We understand the weight of your influence and the impact of your policies. At this critical juncture, we need you to fulfill your pledge to help secure the hostages' release. Every previous attempt has ended in failure. Hamas continues its pattern of rejection, seemingly intent on maximizing our anguish while demanding concessions beyond Israel's capacity to give. Each negotiating delegation raised our hopes, leaving us fixed to news broadcasts and mobile phones, desperate for any sign of progress. Yet Hamas remained intransigent, amplifying our family's torment with each refusal. The time has come to forge a new path for the hostages. The time has come for Israel to dictate the terms of any arrangement with Hamas from a position of strength and power, ensuring that our hostages will be the last hostages in history. Surrendering to Hamas is also not an option. This is why we need you, your policy, and the strength you know how to project in the face of global evil. May God bless you and America.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/07/father-of-hostage-writes-open-letter-to-trump/	2024-11-06T23:00:03-08:00	
Mr. Trump, Ms. Harris: This is how you should deal with Iran	Welcome, President Harris. You have a full agenda, but the Middle East might demand your immediate focus. Here's a key piece of advice: don't listen to your advisors. It's likely that at the top of your shortlist for National Security Advisor is Philip Gordon, your current advisor. Gordon is an experienced, practical figure with a PhD in international relations and over a decade of Middle East involvement. He has proven experience in strategizing, coordinating, and executing policy. The problem is, Dr. Gordon might end up destabilizing the Middle East. The Iranians want a new nuclear deal, much like the one Dr. Gordon helped craft in 2015. At first glance, such an agreement seems like just what the region needs: it would halt Iran's march towards a nuclear bomb and allow the U.S. to pivot towards East Asia and China. However, this kind of deal could actually worsen the situation, for two main reasons. The first reason is that easing sanctions on Iran would give it new resources to bolster its proxy organizations across the Middle East. An Iranian proxy, Hamas, triggered the current crisis. There's no guarantee that Iran would exercise better control over other proxies, like the Houthis or even Hezbollah. If you ease the pressure on Tehran, sooner or later the region will ignite again.

In government corridors, they likely view you as a strategic challenge, if not a disaster. A new nuclear deal might push Israel to conclude that they're out of options and have no choice but to strike Iran's nuclear facilities to prevent it from obtaining a bomb. If the Israeli government expects hostility from you, it might assume it has nothing to lose and that time is not on its side. What should you do? The fact that the Iranians want a nuclear deal indicates that sanctions are affecting them. Allowing Iran to maintain its status as a nuclear threshold state while granting sanctions relief would not only enable it to further enhance its nuclear capabilities but also grant it more resources to do so. Dr. Gordon and many within the Democratic establishment will argue that this is the only way to prevent an Iranian bomb and stabilize the Middle East. When Israel responds militarily and Iran destabilizes the region, these same advisors will recommend trying to prevent escalation, continuing the very failed strategy tried thus far. The end result would be that your administration could face four years of regional war in the Middle East. Instead, it's better to increase economic pressure on Iran and restore Israel's confidence. Accelerate the supply of essential weapons to Israel, while clarifying to Tehran that any deal must include a significant reduction in its nuclear capabilities. A firm approach is the only way to avoid further deterioration. Welcome back, President Trump. I know, you don't really want to deal with the Middle East. But it seems you don't have a choice. The Middle East isn't just hanging by a thread—it's teetering on the edge. Iran and Israel are openly trading blows, and a regional conflict is underway, even if the previous Biden administration hasn't yet acknowledged it as such. The question is how you can stop or contain the descent into chaos. To succeed, you should understand what each of the main players in this drama—Iran and Israel—want from you. Here's how it breaks down: The Iranians are actually the simpler side to understand. They can be divided into two camps. The first camp, led by Iranian President Massoud Pazhekian, wants a nuclear deal. He wants sanctions relief and is willing to limit Iran's nuclear activity to achieve it. He won't fully give up Iran's nuclear program, but why not see how far he's willing to go for some sanctions relief? The second camp, composed of Revolutionary Guard members and radical conservatives, wants the U.S. out of the region and is prepared to use military force to make it happen—not directly, of course, but through proxies in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen. We know that you don't think the U.S. should remain in these countries, but if American troops are there, you certainly don't want them under fire.

The Iranians might believe that escalating military pressure will lead you to be more flexible in negotiating a new deal. They're shrewd negotiators, and they won't enter talks without trying to apply leverage on you. You can expect their proxy activity to increase in 2025, even as they pursue a diplomatic track to secure an agreement. The question is, what will you do? One approach is to ramp up sanctions as much as possible and force the Iranians to concede more and more until they satisfy your demands. But economic pressure will lead Iran to escalate militarily, just as they did in the summer of 2019. In that scenario, you'll need to decide whether to divert expensive military resources to the Middle East, instead of Europe or East Asia. If you're not careful, you might get drawn into a war in the region. Here, Israel could be useful, but you'll need to clarify a few things to the Israelis. Prime Minister Netanyahu and his cabinet will likely want the U.S. to act directly against Iran. You don't want that, and you have no interest in being drawn into yet another endless war in the Middle East. It would be wise to be honest with the Israelis from the start: there won't be an American strike on Iran. But there will be strong American backing for Israel to act against Iran and its proxies. What you'll want to do is flood America's allies in the region with American-made weaponry: bunker-busting bombs for Israel, advanced jets for the Emirates, and precision weaponry for the Saudis. This would enable them to deter Tehran and, if necessary, confront it themselves. Coupled with economic pressure on Iran, you'd have a strategy: pressure Iran into concessions while trying to maintain stability in the Middle East. And remember, stability in this region is always a relative concept.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/05/mr-trump-ms-harris-this-is-how-you-should-deal-with-iran/	2024-11-04T21:45:14-08:00
