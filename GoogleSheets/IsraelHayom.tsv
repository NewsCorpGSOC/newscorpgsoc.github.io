Call between Israeli, Australian ministers takes ugly turn	Amid escalating antisemitism in Australia, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar and Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong engaged in a heated phone call on Tuesday. The discussion, initially aimed at improving bilateral relations, quickly escalated into a direct clash of viewpoints on Gaza. Gideon Sa'ar (Ancho Gosh / JINI) Ancho Gosh / JINI Wong, known for her alignment with anti-Israel voices within the ruling Australian Labor Party, accused Israel of failing to provide sufficient humanitarian aid for Gaza's Palestinian residents. Sa'ar refuted her claims, emphasizing that Israel had endured a large-scale assault on October 7 not just by Hamas but also by five additional entities, some of which do not even share borders with the country. 'Australia chose to distance itself from Israel during the most challenging year in its modern history,' Sa'ar said, condemning Australia's weakened international support for Israel. He further criticized Wong's recent inclusion of Israel alongside Russia and China as part of the same ilk. 'Israel is a Western democracy with robust rule of law, an independent judiciary, and adherence to international standards,' he stated. Sa'ar also protested the recent incident in which former Israeli minister Ayelet Shaked was refused entry into Australia, calling it a diplomatic affront. 'How would Australians respond if we treated one of their former ministers this way?' he asked. Shaked's invitation to a conference hosted by Australia Israel & Jewish Affairs Council (AIJAC) was seen as an effort to strengthen ties between the two nations, making the rejection unprecedented for a figure of her political standing. Reports suggest the visa denial stemmed from her opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state. Addressing the broader issue of antisemitism, Sa'ar expressed concern over the recent arson attack on Melbourne's historic Adass Israel Synagogue, a symbol of resilience for the city's Jewish community. 'Israel expects decisive action from Australia,' he declared. Benjamin Klein, a synagogue board member, described the attack as deeply shocking. 'Our community has been on high alert with security patrols and cameras, but seeing this level of destruction is heart-wrenching,' he said.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/18/call-between-israeli-australia-ministers-takes-ugly-turn/	2024-12-17T15:23:26-08:00	
Are Israel, Hamas near 'almost final' stage of talks?	Palestinian sources told the Saudi news channel Asharq on Tuesday that current discussions regarding a ceasefire and hostage deal have reached an advanced, 'almost final' stage, particularly those taking place in Qatar. According to the report, Qatari and Egyptian mediators are working with Israeli and Hamas technical teams to finalize details of the hostage deal and ceasefire through agreed-upon implementation mechanisms that will be under international supervision. Protesters demand a deal to secure the release of Hamas-held hostages AFP / Jack Guez The sources said the agreement between the parties would be executed in three phases. The first phase would be a 'humanitarian stage' including additional supply deliveries to the Gaza Strip and the release of all Israeli female hostages, including female soldiers, as well as civilian hostages. Furthermore, according to the report, the agreement would conclude in its final stage with a permanent ceasefire and complete Israel Defense Forces withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, including the Philadelphi Route and Netzarim Route. Asharq noted that the IDF would maintain six points in Gaza during the first two phases. Gaza's rebuilding efforts would begin afterward. According to the report, the first two phases would include the release of hostages in exchange for hundreds of prisoners. The ceasefire would likely be gradual, spread across three phases. It was also noted that the first phase would last six weeks. During this phase, it was reported that IDF forces would withdraw from part of the Philadelphi Route to the eastern side of the Rafah crossing. A partial withdrawal from the Netzarim Route and Gaza population centers was also reported. Additionally, it was reported that under the agreement, Gaza residents would be allowed to return to Gaza City and northern Gaza Strip under a military supervision mechanism intended to ensure Hamas operatives do not enter the area. Reports emerged during the day that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was heading to Cairo for talks about the developing deal, though his office denied these reports. Meanwhile, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas was invited for talks in Cairo to discuss developments in the contacts and new arrangements taking shape in the region.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/17/progress-reported-in-gaza-hostage-deal-talks-as-sides-near-agreement/	2024-12-17T07:04:24-08:00

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly on his way to Cairo for discussions aimed at finalizing the terms of the truce, according to Reuters. The negotiations have gained significant momentum, with both sides showing flexibility on key sticking points. Shortly after the report came out, Hamas said an agreement was possible if Israel stopped 'setting new conditions.'

However, according to Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz, Hamas has demonstrated a willingness to compromise on these matters. 'The Philadelphi and Netzarim routes are no longer an obstacle; Hamas has shown flexibility on these matters,' Katz said during a Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee session. Israel has also reportedly softened its stance on certain conditions as negotiators work to establish an inspection mechanism for civilians moving northward – a system that Hamas had previously rejected. The Israeli government official stated that the talks have focused on bridging gaps to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. In a related development, Reuters reported that an Israeli delegation has traveled to Doha to continue the dialogue, signaling the seriousness of both parties to reach a resolution.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/17/israel-hamas-poised-to-conclude-deal-as-pm-reportedly-in-cairo/	2024-12-17T06:20:26-08:00	
Hamas capitulates hostage stance amid growing pressure	Hamas has demonstrated increased flexibility in peace negotiations, offering key concessions in a new proposal for a 60-day pause in fighting and hostage exchanges, The Washington Post reported Sunday. The militant group has retreated from previous demands for a complete halt to the war and full withdrawal of Israeli forces, according to a Hamas official who spoke to The Washington Post on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Progress has also been made regarding the number of hostages Israel demands in the first phase. The number includes, as mediated, adults over 50, those who are ill, and all who qualify as 'humanitarian cases' in exchange for six weeks of ceasefire. In a sign of diplomatic movement, Hamas recently provided Israel with names of living hostages through Egyptian intermediaries, according to a former Egyptian official who spoke to The Washington Post anonymously due to the sensitive nature of the negotiations. On Monday, Defense Minister Israel Katz said, 'There will be overwhelming support for the deal that's on the table, we're closer than we've ever been.' Supporters gather for a demonstration calling upon the US to intervene for the release of the hostages in Gaza, outside the US Embassy branch office in Tel Aviv on December 12, 2024 (Photo: Jack Guez / AFP) AFP The shift comes as Hamas faces growing pressure from Palestinians in Gaza, who are increasingly critical of the group as they struggle with displacement, hunger, and continued Israeli military operations after more than 14 months of conflict. A recent proposal includes provisions for exchanging Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, though Hamas maintains its insistence that displaced Palestinians be allowed to return to northern Gaza, the official told The Washington Post. The organization's military capabilities have been significantly reduced, according to Tahani Mustafa, senior Palestine analyst at the International Crisis Group, though she noted Hamas 'has shown that it has the capacity to maintain a long-term insurgency.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected any postwar role for Hamas in Gaza and dismissed the possibility of the Palestinian Authority's return to the territory. Meanwhile, some members of his far-right coalition are advocating for annexation and resettlement of the enclave. Public support for Hamas in Gaza has declined sharply, with satisfaction in the group's performance dropping to 39% in September from 64% in June, according to polling by the Ramallah-based Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research. Netanyahu said Thursday that Israeli forces had killed 'close to 20,000' Hamas fighters. The IDF conducted operations that resulted in the deaths of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran in July and military leader Yahya Sinwar in southern Gaza in October. Some analysts suggest Hamas is attempting to balance acknowledgment of public discontent while maintaining its position as the face of resistance against Israel. 'Hamas realizes that it will be out of the governance picture for a long time,' but will remain entrenched as 'an idea, an ideology, an active political party in Palestinian mainstream politics,' said Tamer Qarmout, a Gazan professor of public policy at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/17/hamas-capitulates-hostage-stance-amid-growing-pressure/	2024-12-17T04:36:58-08:00	
Defense Minister: Israel will control Gaza like Judea and Samaria	Defense Minister Israel Katz declared on Wednesday that Israel will maintain security control over Gaza following Hamas's defeat, marking a clear stance on the territory's future governance. In a statement posted on social media platform X, Katz emphasized that Israel would exercise 'full freedom of action' in Gaza, similar to its operations in Judea and Samaria.

The Defense Minister stressed, 'We will not allow a return to the reality of before October 7th.' The statement comes amid ongoing international discussions about Gaza's post-war governance and growing debate about the territory's future administration. This declaration provides one of the clearest indications yet from a senior Israeli official about the government's vision for Gaza's security framework once military objectives are achieved.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/17/defense-minister-israel-will-have-security-control-over-gaza-like-judea-and-samaria/	2024-12-16T23:00:18-08:00	
Houthi stronghold reportedly struck again	According to initial reports, another attack took place in Hodeidah, Yemen, just months after Israel attacked the strategic oil storage facility in the city's port in response to Iranian-backed Houthi aggression. It was unclear whether this was an Israeli strike or an American act as part of the US-led operation against the Shiite militia. US and UK forces struck Yemen's Houthis on Monday, January 22, 2024 (Free usage under Section 27a of Israel's Intellectual Property Law) Free usage under Section 27a of Israel's Intellectual Property Law Israeli officials have recently warned that the situation cannot continue and were preparing for a significant strike against Houthi targets in Yemen. On Monday, Israel intercepted a missile fired by the Houthis, just days after they tried to send several unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) launched toward Israel. One UAV was intercepted near Eilat, another was downed using soft defenses, and a third disappeared from radar and has yet to be located. Israel conducted airstrikes against Houthi military positions in Yemen's Hodeidah in late September following missile launches by the Iran-backed group targeting Israel. The operation resulted in 4 deaths and 29 injuries, according to Houthi health officials, while locals reported widespread power disruptions across the port city. Several months earlier, Israel attacked the port following a drone attack on Tel Aviv that killed 1.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/17/houthi-port-reportedly-struck-again/	2024-12-16T22:43:38-08:00	
Hamas agrees to terms for first-phase hostage release	Talks toward a hostage release deal have gained significant traction, according to a senior Israeli government official Monday evening. Recent negotiations have focused on bridging gaps, particularly regarding the deployment of Israeli forces along the Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors during a ceasefire. Reuters reported that an Israeli delegation has traveled to Doha to continue the dialogue. 'The Philadelphi and Netzarim routes are no longer an obstacle; Hamas has shown flexibility on these matters,' Defense Minister Israel Katz said during a Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee session. Reports suggest that Israel has also softened its stance on certain conditions. Currently, negotiators are working to establish an inspection mechanism for civilians moving northward – a system that Hamas previously rejected.

The group is expected to include adults over 50, those with illnesses, and individuals classified as 'humanitarian cases,' in exchange for a six-week ceasefire. Earlier in the day, president-elect Donald Trump issued a renewed warning to Hamas, urging the group to release the hostages before his inauguration. Trump's special envoy for hostage affairs, Adam Boehler, discreetly conducted meetings in Israel with top officials, including the defense minister, foreign minister, and the Knesset speaker. Boehler's request for confidentiality kept these discussions largely out of the public eye, but observers note growing US involvement in the region. During the committee meeting, Katz emphasized his confidence that the deal would secure overwhelming approval within both the government and the cabinet. 'I have instructed the security establishment to place the release of hostages at the forefront of our priorities in the ongoing conflict. 'This is the policy I advocate for, and I am actively working to advance it. With Hamas demonstrating a newfound willingness to compromise, we are hopeful that practical steps can be taken soon. As I have said before, this is a moral obligation and the most important mission before us,' Katz said.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/17/hamas-agrees-to-terms-for-first-phase-hostage-release/	2024-12-16T20:30:45-08:00	
Jewish influencer Montana Tucker releases powerful tribute to Gaz...	American dancer and prominent social media influencer Montana Tucker released a powerful dance video Monday dedicated to the 100 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza more than 14 months after the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre. The video, initiated and produced by the Combat Antisemitism Movement (CAM), features Tucker alongside 35 members of the Sol Dance Academy performing as hostages in a tunnel, delivering a message of survival and resilience. 'It is simply unfathomable to me that more than 400 days after Oct. 7, 100 Israeli men, women, and children who were taken that day are still not home,' Tucker said in a statement released by CAM. 'We cannot let the world forget them and their suffering, and this is why I'm dedicated to using my influence to tell their stories and make sure their freedom remains an international priority.' View this post on Instagram A post shared by Montana Tucker (@montanatucker) Three released hostages – Moran Stella Yanai, Raz Ben Ami, and Hila Rotem Shoshani – appear in the video, along with family members of current hostages Ohad Ben Ami, Shlomo Manzur, and Yossi and Eli Sharabi. CAM CEO Sacha Roytman highlighted Tucker's commitment to the cause, noting, 'Since Oct. 7, at great personal sacrifice, Montana Tucker has emerged as one of the leading young voices for the Jewish people globally. We are proud to have brought her to Israel twice already in the past year to witness firsthand the aftermath of that horrible day, show solidarity with the victims of the attack, and facilitate her advocacy for the hostages, and we believe this video is an important initiative in the effort to return them to their families.' The video has gone viral since its release Monday on Tucker's social media channels, drawing millions of viewers to the ongoing plight of the Israeli hostages. This marks Tucker's second collaboration with CAM on a dance video. In June, she released 'We Can Dance Again,' dedicated to the memory of the 364 young men and women murdered at the Nova music festival on Oct. 7, 2023. That video received more than 10 million views across various social media platforms.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/17/pro-israel-influencer-montana-tucker-releases-powerful-tribute-to-gaza-hostages/	2024-12-16T20:30:08-08:00	
WSJ: US warns of imminent Turkish offensive in Syria	Senior US officials are warning that Turkey appears to be preparing for a large-scale military offensive into Kurdish-held territory in Syria, citing an alarming buildup of forces along the border, The Wall Street Journal reported. US officials told The Wall Street Journal that Turkish military commandos, artillery units, and allied militia fighters have concentrated in significant numbers near the Kurdish-majority city of Kobani in northern Syria, in moves reminiscent of Turkey's 2019 invasion of the northeastern part of the country. 'We are focused on it and pressing for restraint,' a US official told The Wall Street Journal, warning that a cross-border operation could be imminent. The buildup has prompted intense concern in Washington, coming just after Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime fell to rebel groups led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham in early December. US officials view the power vacuum as potentially destabilizing for the entire region. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan addresses provincial leaders of ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) in Ankara (EPA/STR) EPA/STR US Secretary of State Antony Blinken made an urgent visit to Turkey last week to discuss Syria's future with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and seek assurances that Ankara would limit operations against Kurdish fighters. However, US-brokered ceasefire talks between the Syrian Kurds and Turkish-backed rebels in Kobani collapsed Monday without agreement, according to a Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) spokesman, who reported 'significant military buildups' east and west of the city. The developments threaten to undermine joint US-Kurdish operations against Islamic State remnants in northeast Syria. The SDF has been a critical US ally in the fight against Islamic State but is considered by Ankara to be an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party. Ilham Ahmed, an official in the Syrian Kurds' civilian administration, appealed directly to President-elect Donald Trump in a letter viewed by The Wall Street Journal, warning that Turkey aims to 'establish de facto control over our land before you take office, forcing you to engage with them as rulers of our territory.' 'If Turkey proceeds with its invasion, the consequences will be catastrophic,' Ahmed wrote to Trump. The Turkish embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment from The Wall Street Journal. Speaking at his Florida residence Monday, Trump suggested Turkey orchestrated Hayat Tahrir al-Sham's takeover of Syria, saying, 'Turkey did an unfriendly takeover without a lot of lives being lost.' Ahmed warned Trump that a Turkish invasion would displace more than 200,000 Kurdish civilians in Kobani alone, along with many Christian communities. During his first term, Trump partially withdrew US troops from northeast Syria, leading to a major Turkish offensive that resulted in hundreds of thousands of Syrian casualties and displaced persons. The Trump administration later helped broker a ceasefire that required Kurdish forces to cede miles of border territory to Turkish control. Though Trump doesn't take office until Jan. 20, Ahmed urged the president-elect to use his 'unique approach to diplomacy' to convince Erdogan to halt any planned operation, referencing a previous meeting where Trump promised 'the United States wouldn't abandon the Kurds.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/17/us-warns-of-imminent-turkish-offensive-in-syria/	2024-12-16T20:02:09-08:00	
My child is alive': Tensions boil at Knesset as hostage mother p...	In an emotionally charged Knesset committee hearing Monday, the mother of an Israeli hostage held by Hamas confronted Minister Zeev Elkin and threatened to 'take the law into my own hands' if her son was not brought back, while families of those killed in the October 7 attacks pleaded for greater support and recognition. This comes just hours after Israeli media reported that there was progress made in the talks with Hamas over a possible hostage deal even before Hanukkah. Video: Tensions boil at the Knesset over hostages / Credit: Knesset Press Office The clashes on Monday happened during the special committee session on strengthening and developing the Negev and Galilee when Einav Zangauker, mother of Hamas-held hostage Matan Zangauker, confronted Elkin. Zangauker criticized the government's handling of the ongoing talks regarding a deal with Hamas, some 14 months after the terrorist group waged its atrocities and took more than 240 Israelis hostages and killed more than 1200. 'Minister Elkin, you're talking about the price? What price did you pay to enter the government? For which portfolios?' she demanded. 'My Matan shouldn't have to pay with his life, or you can join the government for a few portfolios. The only price I'm willing for you to pay for abandoning Matan is your resignation.' 'Stop deceiving us,' she continued, emphasizing: 'We can prevent soldiers' deaths through a ceasefire, and we can prevent hostages' deaths in captivity. The price is a comprehensive deal with a beginning, middle, and end. All are humanitarian cases, and all are at risk of death.' Matan Zangauker was taken hostage on Oct. 7, 2023 Zangauker accused the government of withholding information: 'Tell the truth to families who have no intelligence about their loved ones, that even the military doesn't know where their loved ones' bodies are. Stop deceiving us. You're busy with politics while they're being murdered in captivity, and their bodies are disappearing.' She concluded with a threat: 'If my child returns in a body bag – I won't put you on trial; I'll take the law into my own hands. My child is alive, and there are a few others like him. Tell the public the truth. Stop your cynical manipulation.' Addressing the minister personally, she added: 'Take off your kippah – what kind of Jew are you? The Creator sees people's true intentions. You and your government partners have lost your way and your values. The price should be a comprehensive deal in exchange for ending the war.'

'Look what they did to my child; they riddled his entire body with bullets. And his girlfriend lying next to him,' she said tearfully. 'Why is no one looking at us? We're not living. No one approaches us, and there's no support. Don't abandon us; we're not second-class citizens.' In an emotional appeal to Acting Committee Chairman MK Yitzhak Kroizer, she continued: 'Look at his neck, his hand, his girlfriend lying on the ground. Look what I received; how can anyone live like this? The families of the murdered are never mentioned.' The mother described her family's difficult situation since October 7, saying, 'Since October 7, we haven't been working, moving from place to place. Our once-united family has been destroyed. I want this in the media. I want the picture of my son and his partner to be in front of you.'After feeling unwell during the session, Kroizer accompanied her outside, promising, 'We are here for you.' They later returned to continue the discussion.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/16/my-child-is-alive-tensions-boil-at-knesset-as-hostage-mother-pleads/	2024-12-16T01:32:17-08:00	
Israeli ambassador to Ireland speaks out after embassy closure	Fourteen months after taking office and several months after leaving Ireland due to anti-Israel measures in the international arena, Dana Erlich, Israel's ambassador to Ireland, speaks about her difficult period as an ambassador in Europe's most anti-Israel country and the decision to close the Israeli embassy in Ireland. 'It's a very difficult feeling. The decision to close the embassy is brave and correct, but it's a complex situation for the staff, the embassy, the Israeli and Jewish community, and on a personal level. As someone who has been on the front lines every day since the tensions began, it's not easy,' the former ambassador said. 'True, Ireland has been a diplomatically challenging country for many years, even before Oct. 7, 2023, but it's still hard to close an embassy. It's a historic event. It's also difficult to part with the people who accompanied us and were partners in the challenging journey we've been through in the last 14 months.' This is Dana Erlich's first role as an ambassador. Previously, she held numerous positions in the Foreign Ministry, including roles in Costa Rica and Los Angeles, political advisor in London, and headquarters positions such as coordination manager in the Foreign Ministry Director General's office and director of the cadet course. 'When I started my mission in Ireland, I met with Irish officials who claimed they weren't anti-Israel, and I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and see where the relations would progress,' Erlich said. Just a month after taking office, she quickly realized that the Irish conduct was anti-Israel. 'In the past year, we've seen how the Irish have crossed every boundary of extremism, to the point of obsession against us. When you ask the International Court of Justice to change the definition of 'genocide' to fit what they want us to be guilty of, which is what the Irish did, then it's already an obsession.' Pro-Palestinian activists from the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign, supported by members of left-wing parties including People Before Profit and the Socialist Party and students, participate in the National March for Palestine from the Garden of Remembrance to Connell Street and Leinster House, on May 18, 2024, in Dublin, Ireland. Photo credit: Artur Widak/NurPhoto via AFP NurPhoto via AFP Receiving thank-you notes from Hamas and promoting BDS legislation 'When they recognize a Palestinian state and receive thank-you notes from Hamas, we understand where they stand in terms of their opinions. When they try to promote BDS legislation that will harm Irish citizens and the Irish economy, these are not steps that contribute to coexistence. These aren't even pro-Palestinian steps; they're anti-Israel steps.' Since she began serving as ambassador in early September 2023, Erlich encountered a harsh reality bordering on impossible, with hostility coming from the media, the political establishment, and ordinary citizens. 'The extreme discourse has taken over Irish public opinion. I think they are in an echo chamber that only fuels each other. The media, civil society, and politicians are competing to see who can be more extreme against Israel. 'I don't think the entire Irish nation is antisemitic or that everyone is against Israel, but given the discourse that has developed, people who think Israel is okay are afraid to express their opinion, and a completely one-sided discourse has been created, including bullying towards anyone who expresses a balanced position, let alone pro-Israel positions. A total distortion has been created here. A one-dimensional narrative against Israel 'We keep saying that there's a one-sided bias and double standard when it comes to Israel, and it's so ingrained in the Irish system that they can't even see it. The delegitimization of any cooperation with Israel, even without government sponsorship, has become illegitimate, and this is what we don't see in any other country. 'I also look at Ireland and don't see that a change in the political map will change their attitude towards us. In the media, there's no other story but a one-dimensional narrative against Israel. In the public sphere, there are no factors presenting a more balanced position. It's one similar voice that is ultimately anti-Israel.' Q: Why is it important to maintain relations with Ireland? 'It's important to emphasize that closing the embassy is not severing relations, but transitioning to a different format. We don't have embassies in every country we have relations with. The decision is to channel and transfer resources to a place that is interested in cooperating with us. We maintain channels of dialogue with many countries where we don't have embassies. Regarding relations with Ireland, there's a Jewish and Israeli community there, and it's important for us to ensure their presence and security.

Photo credit: REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne REUTERS 'There are many large international companies in Ireland, and we have shared trade relations between Israel, Ireland, and the US, as well as relationships with the business sector and the private sector, and these relationships will continue. Israel has relationships with other countries as well, even those that are relatively hostile to Israel's policies.' Delegitimization campaign In addition to the delegitimization campaign against Israel, there was also a delegitimization campaign directed specifically against Ambassador Erlich, including death threats, distribution of posters with her picture, sending threatening letters to the embassy, and countless calls against her, including on social media. 'It's difficult to be at the center of an incitement campaign focused on the country you love and on you personally. It's hard to see the price all the embassy staff members paid because they worked at the Israeli embassy. It was a difficult year for all of us, but what kept me going was the pride I have in having a voice and role during one of the country's most difficult periods. 'The incitement campaign stems from the fact that our messages received resonance and presence in Ireland. I also felt a personal threat at times; my freedom of movement was restricted due to the many threats and the specific situation there. But I think it's not easy for anyone in the Foreign Ministry during this period; it's not easy for any ambassador to be in this situation. What we showed in the last 14 months is that we're not afraid and are at the forefront of facing every diplomatic challenge. At the same time, part of this duty is also knowing how to reassess resources and benefits. Q: To what extent did you experience antisemitism there? 'If we define delegitimization of Israel as antisemitism, then it's impossible to separate the two. Antisemitism is present.' Q: People from the Israeli community in Ireland expressed great appreciation for your activities in Ireland, and at the same time, expressed concern about the future due to the closure of the embassy. What is your message to them? 'I hear their concerns and understand them. We will continue to help them in every possible way. It should be emphasized that their concerns stem from the fact that the Irish government does not provide security for the Jewish and Israeli communities. In the past year, the Israeli community in Ireland has been a close, important, and valued partner. They are amazing people who pay high personal prices in their workplaces because of their support for Israel and because they are Israelis or Jews. I appreciate them, and for me, they are one of the things that made it easier for me, knowing that we are on the front lines but not alone, and they also need to know that they are not alone, and we will continue to help them as much as we can.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/16/israeli-ambassador-to-ireland-speaks-out-after-embassy-closure/	2024-12-15T23:00:53-08:00	
Hostage deal could be reached by Hanukkah, Israeli official says	An Israeli official, previously skeptical about negotiations, confirmed this week that progress has been made in talks aimed at securing the release of Israeli hostages held by the Hamas terror organization in the Gaza Strip. Additionally, a source familiar with the negotiations told Israel Hayom that talks to formulate a hostage release deal are expected to be completed by Hanukkah at month's end, with the implementation spread over an extended period. The main point of contention between Israel and Hamas remains the number of hostages to be released during the deal. A source privy to the details indicated that Israel is still awaiting Hamas' responses regarding both the framework of the deal and the organization's ability to secure the release of hostages it commits to as part of the agreement. Rally for the release of hostages held in Gaza, Nov. 23, 2024, Tel Aviv (Gideon Markowicz) Gideon Markowicz According to the source, Israel will evaluate its next steps after Hamas presents a list of hostages it can release. 'The ball is in their court,' the source said. Despite the gaps between the parties, the message received from mediators has sparked more cautious optimism compared to the past. In the same optimistic tone, Saudi news channel Al Arabiya quoted a senior Hamas official saying there has been 'unprecedented progress in negotiations for a Gaza ceasefire.' As of Dec. 16, 100 Israeli hostages remain in Gaza, having been kidnapped by Hamas on Oct. 7. Thirty-six of the hostages have been declared dead.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/16/hostage-deal-could-be-reached-by-hanukkah-israeli-official-says/	2024-12-15T22:13:15-08:00

One of the most remarkable instances captured Monday was the ribbon symbol representing the hostages, created by Israeli Air Force pilots and aircraft, which was documented by numerous Israelis.

The 'trail' visible in the sky forms when the hot engine emissions encounter cold, humid air at high altitudes, condensing to create tiny ice crystals. These appear as white streaks across the sky. The display was captured from multiple locations across Israel, including above the Benjamin region, photographed from the settlement of Esh Kodesh, the Hefer Valley, Jerusalem, the Greater Tel Aviv region, and above the settlement of Itamar in the Samaria Regional Council. The phenomenon typically occurs at altitudes of 26,000 feet and above, when temperatures are sufficiently low and humidity levels are suitable. Some condensation trails dissipate within minutes, while others can remain visible for hours, depending on humidity and temperature conditions.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/16/watch-israeli-pilots-touching-tribute-to-hostages/	2024-12-15T22:00:06-08:00	
Where are the billions hidden by the Assad family?	Following the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, a global pursuit has begun to trace billions of dollars hidden by the family over five decades of authoritarian rule. According to an article published in The Wall Street Journal, this investigation—expected to take years—resembles efforts to recover wealth concealed by dictators such as Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi, which yielded only partial success. The Journal reports that the Assad family accumulated its fortune through market manipulation, monopolies, and drug trafficking, primarily Captagon—a drug popular across Arab nations. The family's network spans the globe, with estimated wealth ranging between $1 billion and $12 billion. Much of this wealth was hidden in countries outside the reach of international law or in tax havens, complicating efforts to locate and recover the assets.

Bashar al-Assad leveraged the family's economic network to maintain control during his presidency, while his younger brother, Maher, facilitated drug smuggling through his military unit. Revenue from Captagon alone generated an estimated $2.4 billion annually, helping the regime circumvent Western sanctions. Meanwhile, Assad's cousin, Rami Makhlouf, served as the regime's primary financier, dominating sectors like telecommunications, banking, and duty-free services. In 2020, tensions surfaced within the Assad family when Bashar began curbing Makhlouf's influence. Makhlouf was placed under house arrest and stripped of some of his assets, a move analysts interpreted as an attempt to tighten control over Syria's collapsing economy. With the Assad regime's collapse in December 2024, Syrian citizens began taking matters into their own hands. Videos shared on social media showed people looting the family's presidential palace in Damascus, seizing furniture, artwork, and luxury vehicles, including Aston Martins and Lamborghinis.

In one notable case, a French court in 2019 froze €90 million in assets held by Rifaat al-Assad, Bashar's uncle. However, similar efforts to locate assets in Dubai and Russia are expected to face significant challenges due to a lack of cooperation from these nations. One central question in this investigation is the fate of any recovered funds. With Syria now in political chaos and rebel forces vying to fill the power vacuum, it remains unclear how the retrieved wealth will be allocated. Syrian Rebels in Damascus.

'We must return these funds to the Syrian people,' he urged.

Senior Hamas official admits: 'October 7 ruined us'	A senior Hamas official currently based in Turkey told Saudi media that the 37th anniversary of the terrorist organization's founding comes during a period of decline due to defeats in Gaza and the broader region. The official disclosed, 'Hamas is suffering from a genuine leadership crisis. The Al-Aqsa Flood attack backfired on us, submerging us in a sea of blood and crises. The most recent blow was the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria, with which Hamas had been attempting to rebuild relations.' According to a report by the Saudi news site Elaph, the Syrian government has ordered Palestinian terrorist groups to shut down their offices, hand over their weapons, dismantle training camps, and leave Syria as soon as possible. The primary Palestinian group active in Syria has been the Islamic Jihad. In contrast, Hamas's political bureau left Syria earlier due to its support for Islamist rebels at the start of the Syrian civil war, which sparked a rift with Assad. Residents of Hama, Syria, welcome the rebels. Photo: AFP Despite this, Elaph reported that senior Hamas official Mohammed Nasser was forced to flee Syria before Syrian rebels captured Damascus. Similarly, Islamic Jihad Secretary-General Ziad Nakhaleh and leaders of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command (PFLP-GC) also had to leave Syria. Nakhaleh recently visited Cairo with a delegation from Islamic Jihad, holding discussions with senior Egyptian intelligence officials about ongoing negotiations for a prisoner exchange deal. He was accompanied by his deputy, Mohammed al-Hindi. Elaph further reported that it is believed senior leaders of Palestinian terrorist organizations have relocated to Tehran. However, it is expected that they will seek other host countries due to fears of targeted assassinations in Iran, as happened to Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas's political bureau chief.

The Hamas official reiterated that the organization's leadership is currently directionless, stating, 'Gaza has been completely destroyed.' He expressed hope that a prisoner exchange deal might slightly alleviate the leadership's dire circumstances. Meanwhile, reports indicate that Hamas leaders operating from Doha have been instructed to maintain a low profile. They have been asked to halt gatherings and refrain from engaging with journalists outside Qatar. Additionally, foreign delegation visits have reportedly been suspended for the time being.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/15/senior-hamas-official-admits-october-7-ruined-us/	2024-12-15T07:01:32-08:00

Israel to close Dublin embassy	Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar ordered the closure of Israel's embassy in Ireland today, marking a significant downturn in bilateral relations while announcing plans to establish a new diplomatic presence in Moldova. The decision to shutter the Dublin mission comes in response to what Sa'ar characterized as the Irish government's 'extreme anti-Israel policies.' The diplomatic relationship had already been strained after Ireland's unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state, which prompted Israel to recall its ambassador. Tensions escalated further last week when Ireland announced it would join South Africa's case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague, which accuses Israel of genocide. A child holds a Palestinian flag during a protest calling for the government to impose sanctions on Israel, during a demonstration in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and Lebanon, amid the Israel-Hamas conflict, in Dublin, Ireland November 9, 2024. Photo credit: REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne REUTERS 'Ireland's antisemitic actions and rhetoric against Israel are rooted in delegitimization and demonization of the Jewish state and reflect clear double standards,' Sa'ar said. 'Ireland has crossed all red lines in its treatment of Israel. We will redirect our resources toward advancing bilateral relations with countries based on priorities that reflect how different nations relate to Israel.' In contrast, Israel's relationship with Moldova is warm and cooperative, with both countries eager to deepen their diplomatic ties. Moldova already maintains an embassy in Israel, and Sa'ar informed Moldovan Foreign Minister Mihai Popșoi of his decision to establish an Israeli embassy in Chișinău, planned for early 2025. The foreign minister has directed his ministry's director general to secure appropriate premises and initiate the process of appointing an ambassador. 'There are countries interested in strengthening their ties with Israel where we don't yet have diplomatic missions,' Sa'ar noted. 'We will adjust our diplomatic network while considering, among other factors, different countries' approaches and actions toward Israel in the international arena.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/15/israel-to-close-dublin-embassy/	2024-12-15T04:35:18-08:00	
Videos reveal Hamas' brutal treatment of Gazans in prison	The IDF has released disturbing footage from 2023, uncovered by IDF and Shin Bet forces from security cameras at Hamas' 'Al-Katiba' prison, located in the Rimal neighborhood of Gaza City. The footage shows horrific acts of abuse by Hamas prison guards against Gazan detainees, violating even the most basic human rights. Video: Gazan suffers abuse in Hamas prison. Among the disturbing clips, two members of Hamas' Internal Security Apparatus are seen brutally beating a prisoner and even throwing him down a flight of stairs. This apparatus is responsible for detaining and imprisoning Gazan civilians and frequently imposes merciless punishments. The videos prove that Hamas, despite its efforts to dissociate itself from the image of other oppressive regimes in the region, is no less brutal toward the residents of Gaza. This is not the first time 'Al-Katiba' prison has been implicated in severe abuse. Human rights organizations have previously accused Hamas of carrying out unjust and brutal executions at the facility, including against women and numerous civilians. This latest release by the IDF, which follows previous exposés, clearly illustrates the atrocities occurring within Hamas prisons. It reflects the tyrannical nature of Hamas' rule in Gaza and its relentless abuse of the human rights of its own population.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/15/videos-reveal-hamas-brutal-treatment-of-gazans-in-prison/	2024-12-15T00:00:37-08:00	
Report exposes Hamas inflation of death toll	A comprehensive analysis by the Henry Jackson Society, a British research institute, has revealed systematic manipulation of Gaza war casualty figures by Hamas authorities, including miscategorization of deaths and deliberate inflation of civilian casualties, The Telegraph reported Saturday. The analysis found that the data includes misrepresentations of casualties, with natural deaths being counted among war casualties, and systematic misclassification of combatants' status, age, and gender to amplify civilian death counts. The report scrutinizes the Health Ministry's claim of over 44,000 deaths since the outbreak of war following the October 7 attacks. While Israeli and American intelligence sources indicate approximately 17,000 of these casualties were Hamas operatives, the report notes this crucial distinction is largely absent from international media coverage. Researchers identified significant anomalies in the data, including approximately 5,000 natural deaths, such as cancer fatalities, being included in the war casualty figures. The investigation uncovered instances of deliberate misrepresentation, where male casualties were recorded as female, and adults were classified as children, with ages being systematically altered to inflate the reported number of young casualties. The report's authors conclude that these inflated statistics are being weaponized to promote a narrative of indiscriminate IDF targeting of civilians, while obscuring the significant proportion of terrorist casualties.

Palestinian officials strongly contested the findings. Dr. Husam Zomlot, who heads the Palestinian Mission to the UK, dismissed the report as 'immoral and unprofessional,' asserting that the casualty figures have been validated by the UN and other international organizations. He emphasized that the death toll continues to rise due to victims still trapped under rubble and ongoing deaths from malnutrition and healthcare system breakdown.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/15/report-exposes-hamas-inflation-of-death-toll/	2024-12-14T23:00:14-08:00	
Israel fears Syrian events could destabilize Jordan	Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar and Military Intelligence Directorate (Aman) head Shlomi Binder visited Jordan on Friday to address shared interests in light of developments in Syria. Israel is concerned, as reported in Israel Hayom last Friday, that regional instability could also destabilize Jordan internally, and that Iran may intensify its attempts to smuggle weapons through Jordan into Judea and Samaria (The West Bank) due to a lack of alternative routes. This marks the second visit by senior Israeli defense officials to a neighboring country within a week. Last week, the Shin Bet chief and the IDF Chief of Staff visited Egypt to address Israel's concerns over violations of the peace treaty between the two nations. Despite the peace agreements, the evolving situation in Syria poses a risk to regional stability. The Syrian rebels, Photo: AFP The Israeli defense establishment is particularly alarmed by potential unrest in the West Bank fueled by events in Syria. Officials fear that extremist Islamic actors, inspired by Syrian rebels, may launch attacks. In response, the IDF has decided to reinforce security measures for Israeli settlements in the Judea and Samaria and bolster the protection of main roads in the region. Meanwhile, the Palestinian security forces launched a special operation this morning aimed at reasserting control over the Jenin refugee camp. A spokesperson for the Palestinian security forces announced the operation, titled 'Defending the Homeland.' Simultaneously, clashes erupted between Palestinian security forces and armed militants in Tulkarm. Militants hurled explosive devices and opened fire at the Palestinian Authority's headquarters in the city. So far, the security forces have refrained from entering the Tulkarm refugee camp, responding instead with gunfire from a distance.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/14/israel-fears-syrian-events-could-destabilize-jordan/	2024-12-14T12:24:11-08:00	
Trump considers strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities	President-elect Donald Trump's transition team is formulating what it calls a 'Maximum Pressure 2.0' strategy against the Iranian regime, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. While Trump's first administration focused on harsh economic sanctions against Iran, his second term could include military measures, including the possibility of strikes on nuclear facilities. One approach, as described by two sources familiar with the plan, involves increasing military pressure by deploying additional US forces, fighter jets, and ships to the Middle East. The US may also sell advanced weapons to Israel, including bunker-buster bombs that would enhance its capability to disable Iranian nuclear facilities. A student looks at Iran's centrifuges in an exhibition of the country's nuclear achievements, in Tehran, Iran, Wednesday, Feb. 8, 2023 (Photo: AP /Vahid Salemi) AP An alternative path seeks to use the threat of military force, particularly when combined with US sanctions, to push Tehran toward a diplomatic solution. 'Anything could happen,' Trump said in an interview with Time magazine published Thursday, noting there's a possibility the US could go to war with Iran, partly because Tehran had plotted to assassinate him. 'It's a very explosive situation.' Several incoming administration officials have yet to express their views on the matter. Iran-related proposals may evolve as cabinet officials settle into their roles, classified information becomes available, and discussions with regional allies like Israel occur. Significantly, Trump tends to delve into details of foreign policy only when final options are presented and a decision is required, according to former Trump administration officials. Trump advisers supporting the military option are primarily suggesting backing Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities like Natanz, Fordow, and Isfahan, and even considering US participation in a joint operation. The Bushehr nuclear power plant, in the city of Bushehr, southern Iran, 08 October, 2021 (Photo: EPA/President Office) EPA Many Israeli sources express doubt about the chances of success for an independent Israeli strike, especially given that some facilities are buried deep underground. Trump supporters argue that the first months of his second term will provide a rare opportunity to act against Iran's nuclear program while the regime is in a weakened position. This contrasts with recent US policy: the Obama administration pursued the 2015 nuclear deal, Trump withdrew from it and imposed economic sanctions, and Biden attempted to revive the agreement but faced Iranian rejection.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/13/trump-considers-strikes-on-irans-nuclear-facilities/	2024-12-13T00:37:17-08:00	
WSJ: Hamas agrees to IDF presence in Gaza as hostage deal talks a...	Hamas has conceded to two of Israel's primary conditions for a ceasefire agreement in Gaza, Arab mediators told The Wall Street Journal, potentially paving the way for a deal that could see some hostages released within days despite previous failed negotiations. The terror group informed mediators it would accept Israeli Defense Forces maintaining a temporary presence in Gaza after fighting ends – a significant shift from its earlier stance. Hamas also provided a list of hostages, including American citizens, it would free under a ceasefire agreement, marking the first such disclosure since the initial November 2023 truce. The new initiative, developed by Egypt with US backing, aims to build on the relative success of the November ceasefire along the Israel-Lebanon border, which has largely held despite occasional accusations of violations from both Israel and Hezbollah. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday there was some movement in ceasefire talks while cautioning it was premature to determine if an agreement was achievable. The latest proposal, according to mediators who spoke to The Wall Street Journal, envisions a 60-day ceasefire during which up to 30 hostages held in Gaza, including US citizens, would be released. In return, Israel would free Palestinian security prisoners and allow increased humanitarian aid into Gaza.

Photo credit: EPA/Abir Sultan EPA Diplomatic efforts intensified this week as an Israeli delegation visited Cairo on Tuesday, following recent meetings between Hamas officials and Egyptian leaders. US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan is scheduled to travel to Israel, Egypt and Qatar this week to advance negotiations, the mediators told The Wall Street Journal. While previous negotiations repeatedly failed, Hamas has recently shown increased flexibility on crucial issues. Mediators said this includes accepting a temporary IDF presence in the Philadelphi corridor – a narrow strip along Gaza's border with Egypt – and the Netzarim corridor, which bisects the enclave. The terror group has also agreed not to operate or maintain a presence at the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza. Hamas' shift followed the Lebanon ceasefire agreement involving its ally Hezbollah. That deal left Hamas increasingly isolated in its conflict with Israel, particularly after Israeli strikes significantly damaged its leadership and fighting capacity. Arab negotiators cautioned that Hamas could still withdraw from the agreement at the last moment, as it has done before. On Sunday, Hamas presented mediators in Cairo with a list of hostages including US citizens, women, elderly individuals, and those with medical conditions, as well as the remains of five dead hostages, Arab mediators told The Wall Street Journal. The terror group also compiled a list of Palestinian security prisoners in Israeli facilities whose release it seeks as part of the exchange.

Israel has informed negotiators it would reposition forces in other parts of Gaza but rejected restrictions on its presence in other areas, including northern Gaza. The war was triggered by Hamas' deadly Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people – mostly civilians who were murdered in their homes and at a music festival – and saw about 250 people taken hostage. According to Israeli officials, 96 hostages remain in Gaza, mostly Israeli citizens, including dual nationals, and at least 30 are no longer alive. Four additional pre-Oct. 7 hostages bring the total to 100.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/12/wsj-hamas-agrees-to-idf-presence-in-gaza-as-hostage-deal-talks-advance/	2024-12-11T23:30:07-08:00	
Video speed dating for religious Jews launched	There's nothing more frustrating than an unsuccessful first date.

Everyone fears you': Kurdish forces plead for Israeli military a...	The Israeli defense establishment is weighing requests for assistance from Syria's Kurdish minority, who are under attack from Turkish-backed Islamist groups. The appeals for help have reached Israeli officials in recent days following the advancement of these groups and their successful capture of Kurdish-held territories. Israel and the Kurdish forces have maintained an ongoing dialogue, which has strengthened significantly following the fall of the Assad regime. The Israeli dilemma stems partly from the potential impact such intervention could have on relations with Erdogan's Turkey, as well as the American position, which favors stopping the fighting through diplomatic means. Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar has led diplomatic discourse supporting the Kurds and Druze in Syria, raising the issue in meetings with his European counterparts and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Their appeals to Israel have also reached Israel Hayom, 'You control the skies, you didn't hesitate to take the big mountain (Syrian Hermon). Everyone fears you, including al-Julani (leader of the rebel group that overthrew the Assad regime). Turkey is against you, and we are with you. You must help us, for your own interests,' says A. Awak, one of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) commanders in the southeastern sector of the Syrian autonomous region, in a fragmented conversation from the Syria-Iraq border. Abu Mohammad al-Julani, the leader of Syria's Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group that headed a lightning rebel offensive snatching Damascus from government control (Aref Tammawi/AFP) Aref Tammawi/AFP 'The Turks are determined to exploit the success of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and conquer all of Syria to make it their client state,' he adds. 'Only we can prevent this, but we need external help from the West, especially from you, because everyone fears you now. The day isn't far when these Islamist groups will turn against you too.' 'This is a historic opportunity that Israel must seize,' says Professor Ofra Bengio, one of the world's leading experts on Kurdish affairs. 'Israel should assist the Kurdish minority in Syria so they can maintain their autonomy in the northeast of the country.' During Syria's civil war, the Kurds, a pro-Western and pro-Israeli minority, managed to establish control over a quarter of the country's territory – a larger area than most other opposition groups. The Kurdish region in Syria, bordering Iraq to the east, also serves as a buffer against pro-Iranian groups operating in southern Iraq that launch drones and missiles toward Israel. The Turkish interest becomes apparent as the fall of the Assad regime to militias from northwestern Syria in the past ten days has raised immediate concerns among the Kurds. Although this marks the fall of one of their enemies, there are growing fears that Turkish-backed militias will turn against them - a fear that has already begun to materialize. The Islamist groups have captured the provincial city of Manbij near the Turkish border from Kurdish forces, with fighting only stopping after American intervention - though it continued on other fronts. In recent days, they also captured the city of Deir ez-Zor in eastern Syria, including its strategic airport, as well as the city of Al-Bukamal on the Iraqi border. The Kurds retreated across the Euphrates River but fear continued attacks with Turkish support. An Israeli diplomatic source says that Israeli involvement now, even behind the scenes, has more advantages than disadvantages, 'It's clear to us too that the moderation displayed by the heads of the Islamist rebel headquarters in Syria is for PR purposes, and when they can, they will turn against Israel. The Kurds are allies who have helped us in various ways.' However, he emphasizes, 'The picture is complex, and we cannot act there without American consent. There's a chance the Americans won't be too angry if we independently attack targets in the south, far from Turkey, without claiming responsibility.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/12/everyone-fears-you-kurdish-forces-plead-for-israeli-military-aid/	2024-12-11T22:00:23-08:00	
Syrians uncover massive Captagon drug operation in wake of Assad'...	As the Assad regime crumbles, warehouses and factories of drugs are gradually being discovered across Syria dedicated to producing Captagon, a synthetic drug known as the 'poor man's cocaine.' The narcotic, which has wreaked havoc on youth throughout Arab nations, had evolved into a multi-billion dollar annual enterprise. The proceeds flowed directly into Assad regime coffers, providing crucial funding despite international sanctions. The Fourth Division, commanded by Gen. Maher Assad – the brother of deposed President Bashar Assad – played a central role in the Captagon trafficking operation. Foreign reports indicate Maher Assad has sought refuge in Iraq. اهل سوريا بدأوا بحملة اتلاف حبوب الكبتاجون التي كانت في مصانع بشار و ماهر الاسد وبقية مسؤولي النظام pic.twitter.com/NkX5Dyut41 — عمر مدنيه (@Omar_Madaniah) December 11, 2024 Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite party, maintained deep involvement in the narcotics trade, establishing a network of smugglers to move drugs across the Jordanian border. This revelation delivers another significant blow to the terror organization, which not only recruited smugglers but deliberately addicted them to Captagon. Under Assad, Syria had emerged as the world's premier Captagon producer, outpacing even Mexico's drug output. Currently, Syrians are disposing of Captagon stockpiles found in former regime facilities into the sewer system. Footage shows workers dumping bins filled with pills into sewers, while at another location near Damascus, investigators discovered massive drug caches concealed within electrical cabinets. Abu Mohammad al-Julani, who heads Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a coalition of Islamist rebel organizations, declared in an address that the new leadership plans to tackle this industry, noting that Syria had become a playground for Iranian interests.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/12/syrians-uncover-massive-captagon-drug-operation-in-wake-of-assads-fall/	2024-12-11T21:00:37-08:00	
Inside Syria: Israel Hayom joins IDF in Golan buffer zone	We entered the Syrian buffer zone through routes heavy with historical weight – the same paths where Syrian forces breached Israeli defenses during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Since the 1974 Disengagement Agreement, IDF soldiers could only observe Tel Kudna – which we entered this morning in an armored convoy – through binoculars. Now, in a matter of hours, our forces have taken control of the entire buffer zone along the northern Golan Heights. Our journey began at Alonei HaBashan, meeting troops from the IDF's 474th Brigade of the Bashan Division. We donned protective vests, with helmets required only for the border crossing until reaching our destination. The armored vehicle carrying us traversed newly paved routes, created just days ago to facilitate rapid troop movement. En route to the Syrian position at Tel Kudna, we drove through rural areas where locals primarily subsist on farming and shepherding. Those remaining in the area regard the IDF presence with indifference, occasionally even offering smiles. In recent months, our forces repeatedly dealt with shepherds approaching the fence, which is sometimes used as cover by hostile elements. Some locals retain positive memories of the IDF from a decade ago, when our forces provided medical assistance and humanitarian aid, and according to foreign reports, military equipment as well.

Despite Syrian President Bashar Assad's army no longer maintaining a presence here, UN forces remain in the area, receiving IDF protection when needed. The area is now manned by soldiers from the 101st Paratrooper Battalion, who were home on leave after fighting in several Lebanese villages, including Al-Khiyam, following extended combat in the Gaza Strip. Called up Saturday for the Syrian ground operation, these troops weren't surprised – they've grown accustomed to sudden mobilizations after a year of continuous deployments. This time, they secured enemy territory without firing a single shot. From Tel Kudna's peak, Israeli territory spreads clearly before us – windmills spinning near the community of Yonatan.

Photo credit: Lilach Shoval The position is visibly dilapidated. Combat trenches mirror those on the Israeli side. Inside, we found scattered garbage, old uniforms, a broken radio, and Arabic documents caught in the wind. In one building, I discovered a pink notebook – apparently a Syrian soldier's attempt to learn Hebrew. Beyond basics like 'we,' 'you,' and 'they,' it contained military terms: army, division, battalion, company. The debris tells of the hasty Syrian withdrawal last Friday. Their forces assembled, received orders, and departed quickly. Within 24 hours, IDF troops secured the position without resistance. Since entering, the IDF has begun establishing itself in the location, but until containers and equipment can be brought into the area, soldiers sleep on simple mattresses inside the abandoned buildings. When we arrived, some soldiers were engaged in operational duties, primarily maintaining observation of nearby populated areas as well as more distant regions to ensure no enemy forces were approaching. Others rested, exercised, or gathered around campfires. Unlike my previous encounters with troops in Gaza and Lebanon this year, these soldiers showed marked reluctance toward photographs or named quotes. They cited concerns about the International Criminal Court in Hague and potential travel restrictions. Departing, we took an unpaved route carved by the IDF engineering corps. If our presence extends, they'll pave it to facilitate movement, particularly during the harsh Golan winter. The 'New East' anti-tank obstacle.

This defense, one of the security measures adopted following Oct. 7, 2023, aims to prevent armed vehicle incursions into Israeli territory. Anyone attempting to breach this obstacle would need engineering equipment and at least 40 minutes to an hour – critical time allowing our forces to mobilize if necessary. Though construction began earlier, recent events accelerated the work. Completion estimates suggest roughly a year, with teams racing to accomplish maximum progress before winter arrives.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/11/inside-syria-israel-hayom-joins-idf-in-syrian-buffer-zone/	2024-12-11T10:12:01-08:00	
Right-hand man of Syrian rebel leader revealed	The rebels' control over most of Syria and the fall of the Assad regime sparked a faint hope that a new regime in Damascus might adopt a pragmatic stance toward Israel, avoiding open support for its enemies. This hope was bolstered yesterday when al-Julani declared that his government's primary priority is to fight the Iranian axis. While Jerusalem waits to see how the new Syrian administration will act, one figure is critical for Israeli readers to understand to grasp the worldview of Tahrir al-Sham—the driving force behind the rebels' victory over Assad's regime. That figure is Abdel Rahim Atoun, the mufti of the organization and head of the Shura Council of the government it established in Idlib, before sweeping across most of Syria. Atoun is a close confidant of al-Julani and played a key role in shaping the ideological and political foundation of the organization, which seeks to govern Syria. His influence is pivotal in the group's shift from global jihadism and al-Qaeda affiliations to embracing a Syrian national identity rooted in Islamist principles. Atoun himself has transformed, altering his rhetoric and even his appearance, trading traditional head coverings and an unkempt beard for a suit and neatly groomed facial hair, often seen seated beside al-Julaniin meetings. A Syrian rebel fighter. Photo: AFP Despite the image of moderation, Atoun's anti-Israel stance has remained unwavering and has even intensified under his new guise. The blend of nationalist sentiment with aspirations for Sunni Islamist rule has brought Atoun closer to the terrorist organization Hamas, with which he consistently expresses solidarity. He eulogized a senior Hamas figure assassinated by Israel in Lebanon, Salah al-Arouri, and celebrated the October 7 attack on his Telegram channel. Atoun does not shy away from making his position clear. At a conference he convened during the rebel offensive—dubbed 'From Idlib to Gaza'—the cleric praised the Palestinians and expressed solidarity with their fight against Israel. 'The regional enemy of Syria is Russia, while the regional enemy of the Palestinians is Zionism. The brotherhood of Islam unites Palestinians, Syrians, and all members of the Muslim ummah above all other ties. We are in a position where our commitment goes beyond actions like protests,' Atoun stated during the event. The leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, Abu Mohammad al-Julani. Photo: AFP. Atoun often draws parallels between the 'Iranian project,' referring to Tehran's involvement in Syria's internal affairs and its military presence there, and the 'Zionist project,' which he claims meddles in Syria's affairs and poses a threat to it. In 2021, he condemned the US for its support of Israel, stating, 'The wound of occupation in Gaza and the wound of Syria's occupation are the same wound.' It is not yet clear what role, if any, Atoun will hold in the new Syrian government being formed by the rebels in Damascus. However, his profound influence on the leadership of the rebels is undeniable. His statements, delivered under the guise of religious authority, likely reflect at least in part the worldview of those now rising to power on Israel's northern border.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/11/the-zionists-are-the-enemy-right-hand-man-of-syrian-rebel-leader-revealed/	2024-12-11T02:15:57-08:00	
Khamenei claims 'joint American-Zionist plan' toppled Assad	Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei claimed Tehran possesses evidence that the United States and Israel orchestrated the collapse of Syria's Assad regime, according to Iranian state news agency IRNA. An opposition fighter steps on a broken bust of the late Syrian President Hafez Assad in Damascus, Syria, Sunday Dec. 8, 2024 (AP /Hussein Malla)) AP/Hussein Malla The comments come just days after Syrian President Bashar al-Assad fled to Moscow following the rapid capture of Damascus by opposition forces led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and its leader Abu Mohammad al-Jawlani, marking a dramatic end to the Assad family's decades-long rule over Syria. 'There should be no doubt that what happened in Syria is the result of a joint American and Zionist plan,' Khamenei said, according to IRNA, in his first public comments since the fall of his longtime regional ally. In his remarks reported by IRNA, Khamenei alleged that while a neighboring country – presumably Turkey – has played an evident role in Syria's situation, the primary responsibility lies with Western powers. 'Yes, the neighboring country of Syria has played a clear role in this matter and continues to do so – this is evident to all – but the primary conspirator, the main planner, and the central command room are in the United States and the Zionist regime,' he said. The Supreme Leader further claimed to have definitive proof of these allegations, stating: 'We have evidence. This evidence leaves no room for doubt.' The statement marks Iran's first official response to the fall of Assad's government, which Tehran had supported militarily and financially throughout Syria's civil war.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/11/irans-khamenei-claims-joint-american-zionist-plan-toppled-assad/	2024-12-11T00:01:55-08:00	
Inside Assad's new life in Moscow	Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov confirmed Wednesday morning the presence of former Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad on Russian soil, validating widespread speculation that President Vladimir Putin had granted political asylum to the Syrian dictator. After ruling his country for nearly a quarter century, Assad has now joined the millions of refugees who fled Syria during its civil war, officially going into exile. But for those of us accustomed to the Syrian ruler over the years, and perhaps feeling sympathy for the tall, lanky eye doctor, the following details might change that perspective. A man holds an AK-47 and flashes the victory sign as he poses for a photo in a hall of Syrian President Bashar Assad's presidential palace in Damascus, Syria, Sunday, Dec. 8, 2024 (Photo: AP/Hussein Malla) AP Russian media outlets recently reported extensively on the Assad family's assets within the Russian Federation, with their astronomical value revealing the incredible scale of the Assad regime's plunder from its citizens. According to reports, President Assad owns 18 luxury apartments in the prestigious City Capitals project, while other family members hold an additional 20 luxury units in the development. Together, the family controls substantial portions of two skyscrapers in central Moscow's financial district. It remains unclear whether Assad plans to house family members who fled Syria's dire circumstances in these numerous apartments or intends to rent them for substantial income. Additional reports indicate Assad owns other global assets worth at least $2 billion. Western media outlets have suggested Assad plans to retire from political life and return to his work as an ophthalmologist at hospitals in Russia and the United Arab Emirates. While the accuracy of these reports remains uncertain, given the estimated wealth the ruler has positioned outside Syria's borders, he likely won't need to work a single day for his livelihood.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/11/inside-assads-new-life-in-moscow/	2024-12-10T23:00:16-08:00	
Paraguay's president arrives to dedicate embassy, calls it 'histo...	Paraguayan President Santiago Peña arrived in Israel Wednesday, a day before he was to dedicate his country's embassy in Jerusalem. President of Paraguay Santiago Pena (C) signs the guest book as the National Deputy of Paraguay, Raul Luis Latorre Martinez (L), and the Speaker of the Israeli Knesset, Amir Ohana (R), look on December 12, 2024 EPA The visit follows an invitation from Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana, who conducted a diplomatic visit to Paraguay several months earlier. A formal welcoming ceremony unfolded at the Knesset plaza, where President Peña arrived with a high-level delegation, including the parliament president, cabinet ministers, and additional lawmakers. The delegation participated in a meaningful signing ceremony in the Chagall State Hall, followed by press statements and a photo session, before meeting with Ohana in his office. Israeli President Isaac Herzog hosted President Peña earlier in the day, opening with heartfelt remarks. 'We are honored to host you and your wife here in Israel. Your arrival comes at a time when the Israeli public, people, and nation have endured and continue to endure an extraordinarily challenging, painful, and agonizing period. We have suffered the loss of our sons and daughters while 100 hostages remain captive in Gaza's tunnels.' In response, President Peña expressed his gratitude, stressing that he was 'accompanied by a large and diverse delegation, including Congressional representatives from Paraguay. This demonstrates our support for Israel during these challenging times. But believe me, Mr. President, this was something we needed to do for ourselves. It represents a moral imperative from the Paraguayan people, and we carry with us the heart and spirit of over six million Paraguayans who feel deeply connected to the people of Israel. For us, this truly marks a historic turning point.' Speaking before the Knesset, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the assembly and said: 'To the families of the hostages, our distinguished guests, and especially President Peña, my dear friend, and his wife Leticia – along with the esteemed Paraguayan delegation including the Speaker of the House – your significant visit, Mr. President, during our existential war fought on seven fronts against those seeking our destruction, merits exceptional recognition. During this conflict, we were deeply moved by your declaration that 'we will always stand with Israel, regardless of the cost – because this is the right side of history.'' Netanyahu continued, adding that 'taking a moral position isn't always the easy choice. Many turn away, many choose silence, thinking, 'this isn't our fight.' As a courageous, proactive leader, you chose engagement over indifference, and history will remember those who stood with Israel in its darkest hour. Our struggle is the struggle of all free nations. 'We face ruthless enemies, fanatics, barbarians. They attacked us with unspeakable brutality over a year ago. Their heinous crimes defy human description, and even the terrible footage only captures a fraction of these atrocities – the worst since the Holocaust. We are imposing severe consequences for their aggression, dismantling their infrastructure. 'Mr. President, the enduring friendship between Paraguay and Israel gains new significance today through your presence and this courageous alliance. Years ago, Paraguayan passports helped save hundreds, perhaps thousands of Jews from Nazi Germany, including my late father-in-law's family members. Shmuel Ben-Artzi found refuge in Paraguay when he fled. 'We face ruthless enemies, fanatics, barbarians. They attacked us with unspeakable brutality over a year ago. Their heinous crimes defy human description, and even the terrible footage only captures a fraction of these atrocities – the worst since the Holocaust. We are imposing severe consequences for their aggression, dismantling their infrastructure,' Netanyahu said. 'President Santiago, dear friend, Israel stands at the heart of the Middle East. In this wild and turbulent region, we remain steadfast in our mission. We draw strength from our past, act decisively in the present, and work to shape the future. Your visit will strengthen the growing bonds between Paraguay and Israel. Together, we can achieve remarkable things. 'We admire the energy and experience you've brought to rejuvenate Paraguay toward a promising future. Israel eagerly seeks to assist you; we believe in sharing the fruits of progress with our friends rather than keeping them for ourselves. 'We will continue to defend ourselves resolutely against those who seek our destruction. Israel will persist in dismantling the terror networks of the Iran-led axis of evil.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/11/paraguays-president-arrives-to-dedicate-embassy-as-pm-vows-to-fight-iran/	2024-12-10T21:25:09-08:00	
Inside Assad's deserted palace: A trail of anxiety pills and shat...	Rebel fighters and civilians roamed the grounds of Bashar Assad's presidential palace on Tuesday, stepping over shredded posters of the ousted leader who fled to Russia days earlier, according to The Wall Street Journal. Inside Assad's abandoned office, books, papers, and personal items lay scattered. Among them were a history of the Russian military, a map of northeastern Syria, a biography of Assad, and strips of benzodiazepine antianxiety pills. On a yellowed window overlooking Damascus, graffiti read, 'God damn your soul, Hafez,' a reference to Assad's late father, Hafez Assad, who ruled Syria for three decades before passing power to his son. The palace, perched on a hill near Damascus, offered a stark view of the final days of a dictator whose brutal tactics – including torture, bombings, and chemical attacks – defined his efforts to crush a rebellion that erupted during the Arab Spring in 2011. Demonstrators filled Umayyad Square in central Damascus, celebrating with rebel fighters brandishing rifles and waving the green, white, and black flag of the Syrian revolution. After years of civil war, Assad's regime collapsed in less than two weeks as allies Russia and Iran failed to halt the rebels' swift advance, The Wall Street Journal reported. Rebels aligned with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a group previously linked to al Qaeda, took control of several cities before entering Damascus on Sunday with little resistance. On Tuesday, a rebel soldier, Mustafa Hassan, walked through the palace's entry hall with comrades. 'The nightmare is over,' said Hassan, a former history teacher from Raqqa who joined the 2011 protests and later took up arms. Imprisoned by the Islamic State during its occupation of Raqqa, he now envisions rebuilding Syria. 'We're done with one battle, and we're beginning another: a battle of building and developing relations with other countries,' he told The Wall Street Journal. Syrian rebels celebrate following the takeover of Damascus, in Homs, Syria, Dec. 8, 2024 (EPA/Bilal Al Hammoud) EPA/Bilal Al Hammoud Designed by a Japanese architect and completed in 1990 during Hafez Assad's rule, the palace remains a relic of authoritarian architecture. Vast marble floors, cuboid halls, and underground bunkers showcase its dual purpose as a fortress and a symbol of power. In an underground cabinet room beneath the palace, brass plates marked the seats of high-ranking officials. Assad's seat was labeled 'The Commander in Chief.' Adjacent to this meeting room were underground living quarters with a bedroom and accommodations for staff. On Sunday, HTS fighters secured the palace after euphoric Syrians stormed it, removing furniture and artwork. Videos posted online showed people discovering a garage filled with luxury sports cars, including Aston Martins and a Lamborghini. HTS has sought to maintain order during the transition, preserving government institutions and keeping some regime police in place, The Wall Street Journal reported. This effort underscores the group's attempts to project stability and legitimacy. The fall of Assad's regime is a significant blow to Russia and Iran, his key allies. Russia's military intervention in 2015 had previously turned the tide in Assad's favor, while Iran used Syria as a conduit to support militias like Hezbollah. Now, with Russia preoccupied by its invasion of Ukraine and Iran reeling from Israeli military strikes, the rebel victory shifts the geopolitical landscape. Israel has already acted, moving troops into a buffer zone near the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights and conducting airstrikes on Syrian assets. Meanwhile, Turkey has escalated operations against Kurdish groups it views as terrorists, complicating US relations in the region. Abroad, a debate is emerging over how to handle HTS, which remains a US- and UN-designated terrorist organization. HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani has claimed to renounce extremism and proposed a vision for protecting minorities under the group's rule. However, the Biden administration has refrained from engaging with HTS, while some Western diplomats suggest reassessing its designation. In Damascus, celebratory gunfire mixed with distant explosions as signs of the regime's downfall appeared across the city. Military vehicles lay destroyed along the highway between Damascus and Beirut. Abandoned troop carriers and discarded uniforms on the streets symbolized the regime's rapid disintegration. Across Syria, residents tore down statues of Hafez Assad and replaced the regime's red, black, and white flag with the rebel banner. Youssef al-Masri, a 54-year-old Islamic scholar, joined the celebrations in Umayyad Square. 'There are no words in Arabic or in any language to express the joy that is in our hearts after the end of 45 years of repression,' he told The Wall Street Journal. 'Today, we breathe.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/11/inside-assads-deserted-palace-a-trail-of-anxiety-pills-and-shattered-power/	2024-12-10T21:00:46-08:00

Floyd Mayweather was evacuated from London's Hatton Garden jewelry district after being confronted by protesters over his support for Israel, according to a report by The Sun. The undefeated boxing champion was shopping for luxury watches and jewelry when he encountered a group of eight to ten individuals who challenged him about his stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, according to The Sun. Security footage shows Mayweather being quickly escorted into a black SUV and driven away from the scene. #FloydMayweather's visit to London was derailed by an angry mob of anti-Israel protesters this week. pic.twitter.com/6Nb2MmUBri — TMZ (@TMZ) December 10, 2024 The former boxer had recently demonstrated his backing for Israel through several high-profile visits following Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, in which more than 1,000 people were killed – mostly civilians – and 250 were taken hostage by Hamas. He also made a $100,000 donation to Israel's United Hatzalah organization. Last month, Mayweather hosted a barbecue at an Israel Defense Forces military base and met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom he publicly encouraged to 'never back down.' A witness told The Sun that the incident lasted approximately two minutes, with at least one person allegedly attempting to strike Mayweather. However, in an Instagram post, Mayweather clarified that he emerged from the confrontation unharmed and was not physically touched This is not the first time Mayweather has faced public criticism over his position on the conflict. Earlier this year, during a Las Vegas press conference for his new vape brand launch, an activist confronted him, and his security team confiscated a Palestinian flag, leading to loud chants of 'Free Palestine' from attendees.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/11/boxing-legend-mayweather-confronted-in-london-over-pro-israel-stance/	2024-12-10T18:30:39-08:00	
Operation 'Arrow of Bashan': Israel strikes amid Syrian upheaval	In a significant military campaign that began Saturday, the IDF has concluded an extensive series of strikes throughout Syria as part of Operation Arrow of Bashan. Military sources revealed that hundreds of strategic targets across Syrian territory were struck in an operation that had remained under strict operational secrecy until now. Simultaneously, the IDF Chief of Staff and the Director of Shin Bet held crucial discussions in Egypt addressing regional security concerns, including ongoing hostage-related matters. Military officials indicate the operation was launched in response to rapidly evolving developments on the ground. While surveillance of rebel activity in the region had been ongoing, the acceleration of events demanded immediate action. The operation received approval from the IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi during a Saturday security assessment, leading to the swift deployment of forces. The operation saw the deployment of 350 Israeli Air Force combat aircraft conducting multiple strike missions. Forces targeted 320 strategic assets spanning from Damascus to Tartus, including MiG-29 fighter jets, manufacturing facilities, ammunition storage sites, Scud missile batteries, cruise missile systems, unmanned aerial vehicles, aircraft and attack helicopters, radar installations, and weapons storage facilities. Strikes at the Lattakia port in western Syria. Photo credit: Arab media Naval forces joined the campaign, executing strikes against advanced Syrian naval vessels at two coastal locations – Lattakia and Minet el-Beida. Military sources confirmed that the targeted assets, which included dozens of sea-to-sea missiles capable of striking targets 50-62 miles away, had been under sustained intelligence monitoring for years. In response to the Syrian developments, IDF forces have established positions at strategic locations along the buffer zone border. This deployment aims to safeguard Israeli civilians and prevent critical military capabilities from falling into unauthorized possession. During buffer zone operations, various weapons systems were discovered, with the military emphasizing its commitment to addressing any additional armaments found in the region. Officials stress that these actions are defensive in nature and do not constitute interference in Syria's internal conflict. Addressing the Iranian dimension, military sources indicate that Tehran has experienced a substantial decline in its Syrian foothold, significantly diminishing its operational capabilities against Hezbollah. The IDF maintains its focus on the Syria-Lebanon border, emphasizing that any attempts to transfer weapons will trigger a military response.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/10/operation-arrow-of-bashan-israel-strikes-amid-syrian-upheaval/	2024-12-10T08:34:51-08:00	
Leading Syrian chemist assassinated in Damascus home	In a significant development highlighting Syria's deteriorating security situation, Dr. Hamdi Ismail Nada, a distinguished chemical scientist, was killed Tuesday at his Damascus home under what Syrian media described as 'mysterious circumstances.'

Strikes at the Latakia port in western Syria. Photo credit: Arab media Speaking to Syrian media outlets, local sources expressed shock throughout Syria's academic and scientific circles. They emphasized Dr. Nada's prominence in his field, citing his substantial contributions to chemical research developments at both national and international levels. While the perpetrators remain unidentified, Arab media sources have reported multiple Israeli strikes over the past 24 hours targeting facilities connected to SSRC, a research institute historically linked to Syria's chemical weapons program.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/10/leading-syrian-chemist-assassinated-in-damascus-home/	2024-12-09T23:00:37-08:00	
Israel strikes hundreds of targets across Syria	The IDF conducted a wave of airstrikes in Syria overnight Monday into Tuesday, focusing on eliminating Assad regime military assets. Over the past few days, hundreds of targets have been hit, including fighter jets, arms depots, air defense systems, surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles, cruise missiles, long-range rockets, and coastal missile batteries. Despite claims to the contrary, IDF ground forces have not approached within 12 miles of Damascus. Israeli officials maintain that operations are currently restricted to the buffer zone. While this is described as a temporary measure, its duration depends on the evolving situation. Israeli intelligence remains focused on Iran, which has faced severe setbacks, losing key strategic allies like Hezbollah and, now, the Assad regime in Syria. Western powers are increasingly alarmed that Iran may accelerate efforts to enrich uranium to weapons-grade levels. Nonetheless, experts highlight that weaponization – a process estimated to take 18 months – remains a separate challenge. Strikes at the Latakia port in western Syria (Arab networks) Russian news agency Sputnik, citing Syrian sources, reported Israeli airstrikes targeting the Shayrat military airport in Homs province, alongside attacks on military installations in the provinces of Raqqa and Hasakah. Reports in Arab media suggest IDF forces have taken Hina village and advanced toward the outskirts of Khan al-Shaykh in southern Syria, capturing other locations in the region. Syrian outlets described further airstrikes on Qudsaya's outskirts near Damascus and the Qalamoun mountains along the Lebanese border. Additional hits were reported in Latakia and Homs. Syria's representative to the UN urged the Security Council and Secretary-General to 'halt Israeli exploitation of the nation's political transition.' Meanwhile, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights documented 310 airstrikes within 24 hours, targeting former regime sites and vacated military positions. Additionally, the Syrian Observatory noted that Turkish-backed factions had seized Manbij from Kurdish forces. The IDF reportedly remains stationed near the southern borders of Rif Dimashq province.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/10/israel-strikes-hundreds-of-targets-across-syria/	2024-12-09T22:30:29-08:00

Negotiations for a new hostage deal between Israel and Hamas have reached an advanced stage, with both sides exchanging lists of names through mediators, according to Arab media reports. The proposed agreement could include the release of four American citizens held in Gaza who don't meet the humanitarian criteria of previous deals. Israeli sources familiar with the details assess that a 'dramatic development' could occur in the coming days. According to the source, the technical committees from Israel, Egypt, and Hamas have begun working on the details of the hostage deal. The source noted that both sides are showing unprecedented seriousness in reaching an agreement. Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, and the USA are participating in overseeing the negotiations. Rally for the release of Israeli hostages held in the Gaza Strip Gideon Markowicz According to Al-Arabi Al-Jadid, the Hamas delegation, which has since left Cairo, provided Egyptian intelligence officials with a list of names during a visit lasting several hours Sunday. According to the report, the list included names of Israeli hostages who are ill and elderly who should be included in the deal. Hamas also provided a list of prisoners in detention that they want released. Also on Sunday, Hamas announced that its delegation left Cairo after meeting with the head of Egyptian intelligence to discuss efforts for a Gaza ceasefire and the establishment of a committee to manage the strip. The delegation emphasized its pursuit of successful efforts to end the hostilities. The Qatari newspaper reported that Hamas agreed to a 60-day transition phase during which additional fuel and medical supplies would enter Gaza. As of Dec. 9, 101 Israelis are held hostage in Gaza, having been kidnapped by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7. Thirty-six of them have been declared dead.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/09/hamas-israel-reportedly-exchange-list-of-hostages/	2024-12-08T23:54:42-08:00

One of them is the collapse of the Separation of Forces Agreement from 1974 between Israel and Syria. This agreement held for 50 years. Last night, it collapsed. The Syrian army abandoned its positions. We gave the Israeli army the order to take over these positions to ensure that no hostile force embeds itself right next to the border of Israel. This is a temporary defensive position until a suitable arrangement is found.' Defense Minister Katz reinforced the security message, emphasizing Israel's determination to prevent a return to vulnerability along the border, promising to protect all Golan Heights communities – both Jewish and Druze. While maintaining a firm security stance, Netanyahu delivered a message of openness. He recalled the Israeli field hospital that treated thousands of Syrians during the civil war, noting that hundreds of Syrian children were born in Israel. He extended 'a hand of peace' to the Druze – 'who are brothers of our Druze brothers in Israel' – as well as 'to the Kurds, to the Christians, and to the Muslims who want to live in peace with Israel.' Netanyahu concluded by stating, 'If we can establish neighborly relations and peaceful relations with the new forces emerging in Syria, that's our desire. But if we do not, we will do whatever it takes to defend the State of Israel and the border of Israel.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/08/netanyahu-tours-syrian-border-extends-hand-of-peace-to-rebels/	2024-12-08T06:31:20-08:00	
Plane crash or exile? Mystery surrounds Assad's fate	Syrian rebels declared President Bashar al-Assad's 24-year rule over on Sunday after seizing control of Damascus, while questions swirled about the fate of the longtime leader following reports of a mysterious flight from the capital, according to Reuters. A ullet-riddled portrait of now-toppled Syrian President Bashar Assad in Hama, December 2024 (Omar Haj Kadour / AFP) Omar Haj Kadour / AFP A Syrian Air plane that took off from Damascus airport around the time rebels entered the capital initially flew toward Syria's coastal region, a stronghold of Assad's Alawite sect, before making an abrupt U-turn and disappearing from radar, flight tracking data showed. Two Syrian sources told Reuters there was 'a very high probability' that Assad may have been killed in a plane crash, though this could not be independently verified. The dramatic collapse of the regime sent thousands of Syrians into the streets of Damascus, with witnesses telling Reuters that crowds gathered in a main square chanting 'Freedom' from half a century of Assad family rule. The IDF has assessed that Assad is no longer in Damascus, though they cannot confirm whether he has left the country entirely, according to information shared with Reuters. Military sources indicated that Syria is experiencing significant instability, with the army's dissolution indicating an internal collapse. They noted that the disruption of the Syrian axis, which began following events of October 8 in the northern theater, played a crucial role in current developments. IDF officials emphasized to Reuters their close monitoring of Iranian activity in the region, focusing particularly on preventing military capabilities from moving from Syria to Lebanon. They noted that some Iranian entities are cutting ties with Syria, while warning that Israel would respond decisively if Hezbollah attempts to transfer or concentrate military capabilities along the Syria-Lebanon border. Syria's army command officially notified officers that Assad's regime had ended, according to a Syrian officer who spoke to Reuters. However, the Syrian army later claimed it was continuing operations against what it called 'terrorist groups' in key cities including Hama, Homs, and the Deraa countryside. Prime Minister Mohammad Ghazi al-Jalali called for free elections and said he had been in contact with rebel commander Abu Mohammed al-Golani to discuss managing the transition period. The Syrian rebel coalition said it is working to complete the transfer of power to a transitional governing body. While Israel maintains a policy of non-intervention in Syrian internal affairs, the IDF is closely watching the rebel organization 'Tahrir al-Sham' and assessing its governmental organization and potential impact on the border. Military officials stressed to Reuters that despite this non-intervention policy, Israel will strike against any threats, both ground and aerial. The sudden power shift marks a major setback for Russia and Iran, which had propped up Assad during critical moments in the civil war but were weakened by other regional crises. The developments have stunned Arab capitals and raised fears of new regional instability. Western governments now face decisions about how to engage with a new administration in which Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), formerly an al Qaeda affiliate, appears poised to have significant influence. The group's leader al-Jawlani broke ties with al Qaeda in 2016. 'The real question is how orderly will this transition be, and it seems quite clear that Golani is very eager for it to be an orderly one,' Joshua Landis, Director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, told Reuters. 'They are going to have to rebuild... they will need Europe and the U.S. to lift sanctions.' In Homs, celebratory crowds poured into the streets after the army's withdrawal from the strategic central city. The rebels' capture of Homs gave them control of Syria's heartland and key crossroads, cutting off Damascus from coastal regions where Assad's Alawite sect holds sway and Russian forces maintain military bases. The IDF General Staff is conducting frequent situational assessments and implementing forward defense in the buffer zone to keep threats away from the fence. They remain in contact with UN forces, who maintain their positions in Syria, while closely tracking weapons capabilities and ensuring air and ground superiority in the region. Yesterday, IDF forces worked to remove a threat to UN peacekeeping forces.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/08/plane-crash-or-exile-mystery-surrounds-assads-fate/	2024-12-07T23:57:00-08:00
