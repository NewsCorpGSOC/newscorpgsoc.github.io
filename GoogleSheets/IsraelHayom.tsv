Syrian rebels seize Aleppo as Kurds launch eastern offensive	Syria's complex civil war entered a new phase this week as Islamic rebels consolidated their control over Aleppo, while US-backed Kurdish forces launched a separate offensive against President Bashar al-Assad's army and Iranian-backed groups in the country's eastern regions, significantly altering the conflict's dynamics. The last 24 hours have witnessed intense exchanges of fire between the Syrian Democratic Forces (a Kurdish-led coalition backed by the United States) and Assad's forces alongside pro-Iranian armed groups. Success by the Kurdish-led coalition in this arena could prove advantageous for Israel by disrupting Iranian arms supply networks. Foreign reports indicate that the Syrian Democratic Forces and the Deir ez-Zor Military Council have initiated 'Operation Return,' targeting a series of villages currently held by Assad's forces and pro-Iranian armed groups. Their declared purpose is to enable the return of residents who were previously forced from these villages. The Syrian News Agency, a media outlet aligned with the Assad government, reported that its military and 'auxiliary forces' are responding to an offensive in eastern Deir ez-Zor. The report characterized the Syrian Democratic Forces as 'terrorists belonging to a separatist militia.' In western Syria, the Islamic rebels' command center announced control over more than 15 villages and towns in northwestern Hama province, with forces advancing toward Hama city. This campaign, spearheaded by the jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, carries the name 'Deterrence of Aggression.' The northern province of Idlib has also fallen entirely under their control. Concurrently, the Syrian National Army, comprising various Islamic armed groups, some receiving Turkish support, has opened another front against the Syrian Democratic Forces. These groups are targeting Kurdish autonomous regions in northern Syria through an operation dubbed 'Dawn of Freedom,' designed to diminish Syrian Democratic Forces' influence. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government in Turkey maintains a strategic interest in reducing Kurdish power and is acting in pursuit of this objective. Recent diplomatic engagement between Turkish and Iranian foreign ministers concluded with both sides acknowledging their divergent views on Syrian developments. At a joint press conference, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated, 'it's natural we have differences.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/03/syrian-rebels-seize-aleppo-as-kurds-launch-eastern-offensive/	2024-12-02T23:00:15-08:00	
Mother of Hamas-held US citizen Keith Siegel dies	The family of Keith Siegel, held by Hamas since being taken from his home in Kfar Aza during the Oct. 7 atrocities in 2023, announced the passing of his mother. In an emotional Facebook post, Siegel's daughter Ilan shared the family's anguish: 'My father's mother has passed away, and my father couldn't say goodbye to her because he has been held captive by Hamas for over a year.' The daughter recalled the horrific ordeal Siegel has had to endure since taken by the Isalmic terrorists on that fateful morning, when thousands invaded Israeli territory and killed more than 1,000 and took some 250 captive. Siegel's wife, Aviva, was among those whore returned as part of the Nov. 2023 swap with Hamas. Soldiers removing a body in Kfar Aza after the Hamas massacre (Haim Goldberg/Flash90) Haim Goldberg/Flash90 'My father was forcibly taken from his home by terrorists barely in their twenties. He's being held in dark tunnels, enduring severe hunger and both emotional and physical abuse just an hour's drive from Tel Aviv. While government officials work from secure facilities in the Kirya, he remains trapped in the most horrifying conditions imaginable, with no immediate prospect of return,' she wrote on Facebook. 'My father couldn't come to say goodbye to his mother, who can never return. My father, a man who dedicated his life to doing good, who believed in goodness and loved humanity. My father is 65 years old. Dad won't be able to stand with us tomorrow at the cemetery, he won't be able to say goodbye to the woman who raised him and loved him all his life. A violent and murderous terror organization is dictating our lives from the Gaza Strip to the great United States, and the world remains silent.' Siegel's condition is unknown. Hamas released a video in April in which they coerced him to play along with their propaganda messages aimed at pressuring Israeli decisionmakers to make a deal.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/03/mother-of-hamas-held-us-citizen-keith-siegel-dies/	2024-12-02T22:36:25-08:00	
Trump: 'If the hostages are not released, there will be ALL HELL ...	President-elect Donald Trump issued a strong warning to Hamas today (Monday), addressing the terrorists holding hostages in the Gaza Strip. He emphasized that if the hostages are not released before his inauguration on January 20, severe repercussions will follow. On his social media platform, Trump wrote: 'Everybody is talking about the hostages who are being held so violently, inhumanely, and against the will of the entire World, in the Middle East - But it's all talk, and no action!' He continued: 'Please let this TRUTH serve to represent that if the hostages are not released prior to January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume Office as President of the United States, there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against Humanity. Donald Trump (Archive). Photo: AFP Trump added: 'Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW!' The dramatic statement comes following an announcement by the IDF spokesperson regarding the death of Omri Neutra, who was killed in combat on October 7 and subsequently abducted to Gaza by the terrorist organization.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/03/trump-if-the-hostages-are-not-released-there-will-be-all-hell-to-pay-in-the-middle-east/	2024-12-02T14:20:30-08:00	
Iran hackers posed as Israeli officials in plot targeting leaders	The Shin Bet security agency revealed Monday that it has detected roughly 200 Iranian-orchestrated cyberattacks targeting Israeli citizens, including high-ranking public officials and notable public figures, such as attorney Yossi Fuchs. A senior Shin Bet official characterized the campaign as a significant escalation in Iran's ongoing operations against Israel, specifically designed to enable assassination attempts. In a detailed briefing, the security service disclosed that it had identified an extensive Iranian phishing operation in recent months. The targets included senior defense establishment figures, political leadership, academic researchers, media professionals, journalists, and other prominent individuals. The sophisticated campaign sought to compromise targets' digital footprint – including email accounts, computers, and mobile devices – with the ultimate goal of harvesting sensitive personal information. The attackers particularly focused on gathering residential addresses, personal connections, and routine location data. According to security officials, this intelligence was intended to support Iranian-directed operations within Israel, potentially executed through locally recruited cells. The Shin Bet and Israel Police have successfully prevented nine separate attempts by Iranian operators to recruit Israeli citizens for such operations in recent months. The cyber operatives typically initiated contact through WhatsApp, Telegram, or email communications. Each approach was meticulously crafted with a personalized cover story matching the target's professional sphere, designed to appear legitimate and avoid triggering suspicion. The technical aspect of the operation involved two primary attack vectors: persuading targets to download malware-infected applications or directing them to sophisticated phishing websites that mimicked legitimate services. These fake sites prompted targets to enter their email credentials, allowing the attackers to harvest login information and gain unauthorized access to their email accounts. Following the discovery of this campaign and a comprehensive investigation that revealed its full scope and identified compromised individuals, the Shin Bet initiated a large-scale notification operation. This included alerting affected citizens, providing detailed security briefings, and issuing guidance on enhanced cybersecurity measures and personal safety protocols.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/02/iran-hackers-posed-as-israeli-official-in-plot-targeting-leaders/	2024-12-02T05:26:25-08:00	
NYT: Israel built military bases in Gaza	According to a report based on satellite imagery analyzed by The New York Times, Israel has significantly expanded its military footprint in central Gaza, building fortified bases and demolishing hundreds of buildings in recent months, suggesting possible plans for extended control in the region. Israeli forces have transformed a four-mile road known as the Netzarim corridor into an 18-square-mile controlled territory that divides the Gaza Strip. The military has demolished over 600 buildings since early September to create a buffer zone while rapidly expanding a network of bases with defensive fortifications. Twelve of these bases were either built or expanded since early September, indicating an accelerating pace of construction. 'Anything that has been built there can be taken down within a day,' Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli military spokesman, said in an interview with The New York Times. The alleged bases demonstrate a significant investment in infrastructure, featuring paved grounds, walls, barracks, access roads, and parking for armored vehicles. Many are fortified with defensive ditches and mounds to obstruct vehicles, suggesting a long-term presence despite official statements to the contrary. Israeli tanks patrol near the border with the Gaza Strip in southern Israel, 07 January 2024. Photo credit: EPA/Abir Sultan EPA The New York Times claims to have verified 11 drone videos showing the systematic demolition of buildings in the area, providing bird's-eye views of Israel's efforts to remake the geography south of Gaza City. Lt. Col. Shoshani told The New York Times that some of the demolished buildings had been used by Hamas as lookout posts and hiding places. This way, Hamas terrorists would now be less likely to sneak up on Israeli soldiers patrolling the Netzarim corridor or Israeli outposts, Israeli analysts said. The corridor, stretching from the Israeli border to the Mediterranean Sea, enables Israel to regulate movement across Gaza, keeping displaced Palestinians in the south. The controlled area spans roughly 4.3 miles wide and 4.3 miles long. The development comes as Netanyahu has ruled out renewed Jewish settlement in Gaza for now, despite calls from some ministers. The Israeli military presence in the area stems from its campaign against Hamas following the deadly Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, in which approximately 1,200 people were killed – mostly civilians – and 250 taken hostage.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/02/nyt-israel-built-military-bases-in-gaza/	2024-12-02T01:00:56-08:00	
Israel confirms covert hostage negotiations underway	Israeli officials have broken their silence about ongoing confidential negotiations regarding a potential hostage deal, with sources noting that the remarkable absence of leaks – barring minor reports – suggests a serious commitment to the diplomatic process by all parties involved. Sources close to the negotiations emphasize that reaching an agreement will require increased flexibility from both sides. While Hamas has demonstrated some willingness to compromise, questions remain about whether the Israeli government will show similar diplomatic elasticity. Israeli negotiators disclosed that while current talks are proceeding in Egypt without direct Israeli participation, the negotiating team remains fully briefed and engaged in the backstage proceedings. 'There isn't a concrete proposal currently on the table,' one source revealed, 'but new ideas are emerging that we hope will lead to a deal. Hamas' increasing isolation from Hezbollah's support on the northern front has been a contributing factor.'

A senior official told Arab media that the delegations have reached formulations that resolved the disputes which had delayed an official announcement about establishing a committee to manage Gaza. According to the official, the main dispute regarding the management of aid and reconstruction funds has been resolved. In a related development, UNRWA announced Sunday night the suspension of its Gaza aid shipments following the systematic looting of humanitarian convoy trucks.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/02/israel-confirms-covert-hostage-negotiations-underway/	2024-12-02T01:00:08-08:00	
IDF says Israeli-American hostage Omer Neutra was killed on Oct. ...	The IDF announced Monday morning that Israeli-American hostage Cpt. Omer Neutra, captured during Hamas' Oct. 7 assault on southern Israel, was killed in action that day. The announcement comes after extensive analysis of intelligence and evidence gathered since the attack, according to the Military Rabbinate. Neutra, whose body is being held by Hamas, commanded a strategic position near Nir Oz and led the first response forces against the pre-dawn invasion. His tank came under heavy fire from a large contingent of Hamas terrorists, resulting in the deaths of two crew members. Neutra and fellow soldier Nimrod Cohen were captured in the assault. In an interview with Israel Hayom earlier this month, his family revealed their journey from Israel to America two decades ago, where they established an international laboratory research enterprise. Omer and his younger brother Daniel, 20, were born and raised in the United States, immersed in both Jewish tradition and pluralistic values as part of a Conservative Jewish community. The family's world was shattered on Oct. 7 when footage emerged showing their son being pulled from his burning tank. 'We want people to know Omer,' his mother Orna said. 'At 18, he went to Israel for a gap year program and discovered his true calling. He realized that simply feeling love for Israel wasn't enough – he needed to take action.' Despite having secured university admission, Neutra chose to enlist in the IDF. 'We supported his decision completely. He joined the Armored Corps and quickly rose to a command position.' Their final conversation took place on Oct. 6. 'Omer told us they had reduced the alert level for Simchat Torah, suggesting a quieter holiday ahead,' Orna recalls. 'He was commanding an armored position near Nir Oz, with two tanks and several Golani Brigade infantry soldiers under his command. The weeks before had been intense with frequent border incidents, so we were relieved he would have some respite.' The next morning brought devastating news as Hamas launched its unprecedented attack. All contact was lost with Omer. After an agonizing night, the family received footage showing their son's capture from his destroyed tank. Since that moment, they have been living through what his mother described as an 'unending nightmare.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/02/idf-says-israeli-american-hostage-omer-neutra-was-killed-on-oct-7/	2024-12-02T00:23:59-08:00	
In battle and captivity: Tank Crew 3 tragic fate on Oct. 7	The story of Tank Crew 3 encapsulates the tragic events of Oct. 7. On Monday, the IDF confirmed that its commander, 22-year-old Capt Omer Neutra from Long Island, was killed and his body taken captive. His crew – three teenage soldiers barely out of high school – shared the same fate, marking one of the darkest chapters in Israel's recent history. Tank Crew 3 was led by Capt Omer Neutra, commanding three 19-year-old soldiers: Cpl Nimrod Cohen as gunner, Sgt Oz Daniel as radio operator-loader, and Sgt Shaked Dahan as driver. The crew was assigned to Battalion 77 of the 7th Brigade, positioned near the White House Outpost between the kibbutzim of Nirim and Nir Oz. In conversations with their families, they described grueling shifts in their tank, sometimes lasting up to 18 hours. Gazans take control of an Israeli tank after crossing the Photo credit: Said Khatib/AFP AFP When Hamas launched its surprise attack on Oct. 7, the crew immediately mobilized to defend their sector. However, their tank experienced a critical malfunction – reportedly a brake failure – that left them vulnerable. This mechanical failure allowed Hamas terrorists to approach the tank, plant explosives, and capture all four members. During testimony before the civilian inquiry commission, Nimrod Cohen's parents unveiled a series of operational failures that culminated in their son's capture. They described severe technical issues with the tank, noting that 'the brakes locked up, reducing the tank's speed to 5 mph – merely walking pace,' which made it an easy target for Hamas fighters to disable. Yehuda Cohen, Nimrod's father, painted a disturbing picture of operational negligence at the border position. He described soldiers waiting exposed at their posts for tank carriers to arrive, widespread equipment maintenance issues, and personnel walking their posts without weapons. 'The atmosphere resembled a summer camp,' he testified, 'reflecting leadership's misguided message that everything was under control.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/02/in-battle-and-captivity-tank-crew-3-tragic-fate-on-oct-7/	2024-12-01T23:25:07-08:00	
Israeli assessment: Assad allows Iranian forces into Syria	The Syrian rebel offensive, spearheaded by Tahrir al-Sham, a rebel group supported by Turkey, commenced on Wednesday. On Sunday, Israeli officials asses that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is allowing Iranian forces into Syria to bolster his regime and counter rebel factions in the ungoing civil war. This move could significantly affect the dynamics along Israel's northern border. The entry of Iranian forces marks a pivotal shift in the military landscape of the Syrian conflict, with the objective to secure Assad's regime, suppress the opposition, and strengthen Iran's regional influence.

Syrian rebels surround Damascus	Syrian opposition forces have captured the village of Deir Hafer east of Aleppo, Arab media outlets reported overnight Saturday. The northern Syrian city is largely under rebel control, with the remaining portion held by Kurdish forces. Further south, opposition forces have reached the northern outskirts of Hama. Simultaneously, developments are unfolding in southern Syria. Al-Arabi channel broadcast footage of demonstrations in the Damascus area supporting the operations of Islamic rebels. Pro-opposition protests were also documented in the southern city of Daraa, where demonstrations against the Assad regime have been ongoing for several months. Opposition sources in the Daraa region told Al-Arabi Al-Jadid newspaper that rebel infrastructure is already in place there. According to these sources, the goal is to conduct a 'pincer movement from south and north' to attack the capital, Damascus. Reports indicated that the capital witnessed military deployments by Assad regime forces. A local website in Daraa also reported that local factions plan to conduct military operations against Assad army checkpoints in southern Syria. Video: Syrian opposition soldiers playing with a statue head of Hafez Assad / Credit: Arab social media A Syrian source close to the opposition emphasized that, unlike in the past, operations in the south and north will have a higher level of coordination. 'The Assad regime is in a weak position, as are its operators. This is a golden opportunity for Syrians. Syria cannot become a developed country unless this tyrannical regime is removed,' the source said. In northern Syria, the rebels' operations department announced they had taken control of Aleppo and the entire Idlib governorate and succeeded in blocking the road between Aleppo and Raqqa (an eastern provincial city and another key stronghold).

Syrian President Bashar Assad, who returned to Damascus over the weekend, declared yesterday that 'Syria is capable, with the help of its allies, of defeating the terrorists. No matter how much their attacks have intensified.' In a conversation with UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed, Assad said, 'Syria will continue to defend its stability and territorial integrity against all terrorists and their supporters.' Assad also spoke with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, who expressed readiness to assist the Syrian regime.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/01/syrian-rebels-employ-pincer-movement-on-damascus/	2024-11-30T23:00:36-08:00	
These are the rebels fighting the Iranian axis in Syria	Syrian rebels stunned the world on Wednesday with a large-scale surprise attack on the defensive lines of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime in the country's north. In less than 72 hours, the rebels seized vast parts of Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city, which had taken Assad's forces over four years to capture from the opposition. Video: Rebels arrive in Aleppo, Syria. Source: Arab networks The rebels employed tactics all too familiar to Israelis: rocket fire, drones, and surprise raids by light forces using pickup trucks from hidden positions and pre-prepared tunnels to evade the Russian and Syrian air forces that dominate the skies. The operation was a resounding success, leaving the Syrian army and its allies—Iranian militias and Russian forces—caught off guard and in disarray. Images and videos circulated of rebels celebrating their victory, taking prisoners, capturing abandoned Syrian military equipment, and chanting religious slogans with fervor. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Photo: Reuters But who are these rebels, and where did they emerge from after years of Syria's civil war slipping from global awareness? The answer is complex, much like the intricacies of Syrian insurgent politics. Broadly speaking, the rebel forces can be divided into two primary factions. Tahrir al-Sham The first faction is Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), or simply Tahrir al-Sham. This is an extremist Islamist organization with roots in al-Qaeda operatives who joined the uprising against Assad early on. HTS is led by Abu Mohammad al-Julani, the most powerful figure among the Syrian rebels and the driving force behind the northern offensive. The rebels in Syria. Photo: Reuters HTS has been preparing for this offensive for over two years, undergoing extensive training—likely with funding and support from Gulf states—and building underground command infrastructures while stockpiling weapons and ammunition from Turkey. How extreme is HTS? While Julani has softened some of his positions over the years, at least publicly, many of the group's members are former al-Qaeda and ISIS fighters, some of whom proudly bear the Islamic State flag on their uniforms. The Syrian National Army The second major force leading the offensive is a coalition of dozens of groups under the umbrella of the 'Syrian National Army' (SNA), a body that receives direct military support from Turkey and enjoys unwavering backing from Ankara. The groups within the SNA are diverse, ranging from moderate, nationalist-oriented factions to outright Islamist groups. Notably, not all these groups cooperate smoothly; in recent months, some have openly clashed with one another. Residents of Idlib in northern Syria celebrate the rebels' takeover of Aleppo. Photo: AFP While only one of these factions is directly linked to Turkey and its support, both rely heavily on Turkey's military presence in northern Syria for survival. Turkey's involvement in northern Syria, particularly between 2017 and 2018, helped the rebels stabilize their frontlines and prevent the fall of Idlib Province, the last major rebel stronghold in Syria. This province has become a kind of 'Wild West,' using Turkish currency and hosting hundreds of thousands of refugees struggling to survive in dire conditions. The perfect storm From this region, which spans large parts of northern Syria, the rebels have been meticulously planning to take back their country. A lethal convergence of Turkey's desire for revenge against Moscow and the weakening of the Iranian axis—due to the blows suffered by Hezbollah in Lebanon—turned months of meticulous preparation into a 'perfect storm.' The Syrian civil war, far from over, continues to reshape alliances and redraw the lines of conflict, with consequences reverberating across the region and beyond.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/30/these-are-the-rebels-fighting-the-iranian-axis-in-syria/	2024-11-29T14:20:55-08:00	
UAE official visits family of slain Rabbi Kogan	Dr. Ali Rashid Al Nuaimi, a senior representative of the United Arab Emirates authorities, arrived at the shiva (seven-day mourning period) in Jerusalem on Friday to express his sincere condolences to the family of Rabbi Zvi Kogan, the Chabad emissary who was killed in Abu Dhabi on November 24, 2024, emphasizing the UAE's unwavering commitment to coexistence and rejection of extremism. During his conversation with family members, Nuaimi emphasized that the UAE will continue to advocate for coexistence and never allow extremists to divide us. 'The state and its citizens are more committed than ever to the values of openness and peace and will increase their efforts to ensure that Rabbi Zvi's legacy continues and that all communities live in harmony in the UAE,' the senior official said.

Nuaimi holds the position of Chairman of the Defense Commission of the Federal National Council's Internal and External Relations Committee. In practice, he can be described as a senior advisor whose words reflect the position of the president of the UAE, Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Nuaimi was among the major proponents of the Abraham Accords and is known as a harsh critic of radical Islam. For instance, in a special interview marking the first anniversary of establishing relations with the UAE, he said of radical Islam: 'This is not Islam, and it does not serve the interests of Muslims worldwide. Instead of religion uniting all human beings, they developed a narrative of hatred.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/29/uae-official-visits-family-of-slain-rabbi-kogan/	2024-11-29T00:00:40-08:00	
Is Tehran changing course amid Trump win and Hezbollah setback?	Iran appears to be recalibrating its regional strategy following Donald Trump's election victory and the weakening of its proxy Hezbollah, the New York Times has reported based on multiple sources familiar with Tehran's decision-making process. In a notable shift from its typically aggressive stance, Tehran has made several conciliatory diplomatic moves. These include dispatching a senior official to Beirut in mid-November to encourage Hezbollah to accept a ceasefire with Israel, and its UN ambassador meeting with Elon Musk, seen as an attempt to establish communication channels with Trump's circle. Seven Iranian officials, including one from the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), told the New York Times that Trump's Nov. 5 election victory prompted this strategic shift. They cited concerns about renewing confrontation with an administration that had previously pursued a 'maximum pressure' campaign against Iran. Donald Trump stands on stage with Melania and Lara Trump, Nov. 6, 2024, West Palm Beach, Florida (AP/Evan Vucci) AP/Evan Vucci This diplomatic pivot represents a stark departure from late October, when Iran was preparing for a potential strike against Israel. At that time, a deputy IRGC commander had declared, 'We have never left an aggression unanswered in 40 years.' The change in approach also follows significant losses by Hezbollah in its confrontation with Israel. According to Iranian media reports, there is growing discontent among displaced Lebanese Shia communities who traditionally look to Iran for protection. Mehdi Afraz, director of research at Baqir al-Olum University, offered an unusually frank assessment: 'Our friends from Syria called and said the Lebanese Shia refugees who support Hezbollah are cursing us up and down, first Iran, then others. We are treating war as a joke.' Iran's domestic challenges have also influenced this shift. The country faces mounting economic pressures, with the government recently announcing daily power cuts. The death of hard-line president Ebrahim Raisi and the election of moderate Masoud Pezeshkian in July has brought promises of economic reform and increased Western engagement. Several senior Iranian officials have indicated openness to negotiations with the incoming Trump administration on nuclear and regional issues. 'Iran is now applying restraint to give Trump a chance to see whether he can end the Gaza war and contain Netanyahu,' said Seyed Hossein Mousavian, a former Iranian diplomat now at Princeton University. 'Without doubt in Iran, among senior officials and ordinary people, there is a real desire to end the tensions with the West and to get along,' Naser Imani, an analyst close to the government, told The New York Times. 'Cooperation with the West is not viewed as defeat, it is seen as transactional diplomacy and can be done from a position of strength.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/28/is-tehran-changing-course-amid-trump-win-and-hezbollah-setback/	2024-11-28T04:59:22-08:00	
Hamas signals openness to Gaza ceasefire after Hezbollah deal	A high-ranking Hamas official has told French news agency AFP Wednesday that the terror group is prepared to enter into a ceasefire arrangement mirroring the recent agreement between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Though the source did not specify ceasefire terms, Hamas has maintained its demands for a permanent cessation of hostilities, backed by international guarantees and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip. Palestinians celebrate by a destroyed Israeli tank at the Gaza Strip fence east of Khan Younis, Oct. 7, 2023 (AP/Hassan Eslaiah) AP/Hassan Eslaiah On Tuesday, an Egyptian diplomatic mission arrived in Israel to explore possibilities for a hostage deal that could potentially expand into a broader ceasefire in Gaza. Previously, Hezbollah had conditioned its cessation of fire toward Israel on the termination of the IDF's military operation in Gaza. The organization has now abandoned this position, leaving Hamas alone in the fighting against IDF forces.

US guarantees on Israel's ceasefire rights to stay classified	An American side letter guaranteeing Israel's rights in case of ceasefire violations will remain classified, Israeli officials announced following a cabinet meeting, casting uncertainty over the document's effectiveness as a diplomatic safeguard. The document, secured through extensive negotiations between Minister of Strategic Affairs of Israel Ron Dermer and the US administration, had been touted by the Prime Minister's Office as a major diplomatic achievement that would guarantee Israel's right to resume military operations if the agreement was breached. Cabinet ministers who reviewed the letter during the session described it as comprehensive, covering various scenarios of potential violations. However, Israeli officials have now indicated that the letter, obtained during President Biden's current term, will remain sealed, raising questions about its practical enforceability.

A notable example was the letter from President George W. Bush that accompanied Israel's 2005 Gaza withdrawal. In a televised address Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu first spoke to residents of northern Israel: 'This war will not conclude until all our objectives are met, and at this stage, specifically not until we can ensure the safe return of northern residents to their homes.' Video: Netanyahu on the ceasefire deal / Credit: Itay Beit On 'Until now, thanks to the valor of our fighters, we have achieved remarkable successes across all seven fronts of this war of resurgence. These achievements demonstrate Israel's power throughout the Middle East, and directly to Iran, which stands at the head of this network. I am resolved to take all necessary steps to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.' Addressing the hostage situation, Netanyahu declared: 'In Gaza, we have dismantled Hamas's battalions, eliminated Sinwar, Deif, and their leadership echelon, and secured the return of 154 of our hostages. We remain committed to bringing everyone home and ending their families' unbearable suffering, just as we are committed to completing Hamas's elimination. In Syria, we are systematically preventing weapons transfers to Lebanon. Assad needs to understand – he is playing a dangerous game.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/27/us-guarantees-on-israels-ceasefire-rights-to-stay-classified/	2024-11-26T20:00:18-08:00	
UNRWA announces closure of east Jerusalem headquarters	UNRWA has announced the closure of its East Jerusalem headquarters, following recent Israeli legislation severing ties with the organization. Palestinian employees have been notified that their positions at the Sheikh Jarrah (Shimon HaTzadik) facility will be terminated. According to reports published by Saudi news network AlHadath, employees have been given a 12-month grace period to find new employment, after which their contracts with the United Nations organization will be terminated. UNRWA's presidential office in Sheikh Jarrah houses the organization's legal department, which oversees the agency's legal matters across all areas of operation. The facility also includes the agency's spokesperson's office and its central communications department. A Palestinian woman stands outside the UNRWA Gaza Headquarters (AP/Khalil Hamra) AP/Khalil Hamra The Saudi network also reported that the agency's foreign employees will not be dismissed but instead will be reassigned to the agency's offices in Amman, Jordan. Following the revelation of UNRWA staff and institutions' involvement in acts of terror, particularly in the Oct. 7 massacre, the Knesset passed two significant laws last month to curtail the organization's activities in Jerusalem and Gaza. The first law, initiated by Knesset members Boaz Bismuth and Sharren Haskel, which passed its second and third readings, now prohibits UNRWA's operations in the Shuafat refugee camp in Jerusalem and all of the organization's activities in East Jerusalem. The second law, initiated by Knesset members Yulia Malinovsky, Dan Illouz, Ron Katz, and others, prohibits contact between Israeli government officials and UNRWA personnel. The implications: denying organization members the ability to work in Gaza, travel to it, or operate there in general.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/26/unrwa-announces-closure-of-east-jerusalem-headquarters/	2024-11-26T01:11:20-08:00	
UN advisor fired over refusal to label Gaza war as genocide, WSJ ...	An op-ed published by the Wall Street Journal editorial board titled 'The UN's anti-Israel 'genocide' purge' claims the United Nations' decision not to renew Alice Wairimu Nderitu's contract as Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide stems directly from her refusal to characterize Israel's military campaign in Gaza as genocide. 'The United Nations long ago lost credibility as a moral arbiter, but its assault on Israel is hitting a new low,' the op-ed began. The UN has decided to fire its Special Advisor on the Prevention of Genocide. Alice Wairimu Nderitu from Kenya is being forced out because she publicly said that Israel's operations in Gaza don't meet the definition of genocide. pic.twitter.com/eceOYCHryM — Visegrád 24 (@visegrad24) November 26, 2024 The editorial board quotes her UN biography, which describes her as a 'recognized voice in the field of peacebuilding and violence prevention.' She has served since 2020 and is being dismissed 'because she has stood firm in her belief that Israel's war with Hamas isn't genocide.' They note that her position has put her at odds with 'the anti-Israel cabal at the UN.' Nderitu's office previously issued guidance in 2022 stressing that UN officials should 'Adhere to the correct usage' of the term genocide, warning against 'its frequent misuse in referring to large scale, grave crimes committed against particular populations.' In defending Nderitu's position, the WSJ editorial board emphasizes the legal requirements for classifying violence as genocide. 'As a legal matter, establishing a pattern of violence as a genocide requires demonstrating intent,' they write. 'Israel's campaign of self-defense doesn't qualify. The war against Hamas has had many deaths, but Israel's strategy is intended to dismantle a terrorist regime, not eliminate an ethnic group.' The board adds that 'The Jewish state has gone to great lengths to minimize Palestinian civilian casualties, even as Hamas uses civilians as shields so their deaths can be used as propaganda.' But, 'That's not what the anti-Israel cabal at the UN want to hear.' The editorial points to mounting pressure from other UN officials, particularly Austrian Volker Turk, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, who the board says 'has spent the past year assailing Israel.' This culminated in a November 14 report from the UN Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices that supported 'serious concerns of breaches of international humanitarian and human rights laws' and 'the possibility of genocide in Gaza and an apartheid system in the West Bank.' UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk addresses media personnel in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Wednesday, Oct. 30, 2024 (Photo: AP /Mahmud Hossain Opu) AP 'The word has become a weapon of political propaganda that will erode its moral authority when it's needed to describe genuine horrors,' the editorial board argues. A UN spokesperson maintained that 'Alice Nderitu is leaving the UN as her contract is expiring,' adding that 'Genocide is strictly defined in international law and any legal determination' is made by 'appropriate judicial bodies.' However, the WSJ editorial board argues this explanation rings hollow, noting that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has the authority to extend such contracts, which are 'often renewed when their terms expire,' Nderitu's 'removal is a political choice.' The board characterizes Nderitu's stance as 'a profile in courage' for 'her refusal to endorse a lie in service of a political agenda,' while questioning whether 'anyone with integrity can survive at the UN.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/26/un-advisor-fired-over-refusal-to-label-gaza-war-as-genocide-wsj-argues/	2024-11-25T23:00:57-08:00	
How does Hamas keep its grip on Gaza's aid?	While fierce battles between IDF and Hamas terrorists have become routine in Gaza, a different kind of conflict has emerged within the Gaza Strip in recent weeks. The terrorist organization is now fighting crime families and mobs who dare to interfere with what has become Gaza's primary source of power and revenue – international humanitarian aid. For this battle, crucial to Hamas' survival in Gaza, the organization is willing to divert weapons and fighters, despite their severe shortage in the war against the IDF. For this purpose, Hamas established a special unit called 'Saham' (arrow in Arabic), whose formation received favorable coverage in Arab media outlets last week. According to the Palestinian news site Shahab, the Saham unit was created by Hamas' Interior Ministry, which oversees the terrorist organization's police forces. The unit consists mainly of former police officers and 'volunteers,' presumably terrorists whom the organization has pulled from combat duties. However, Gaza bloggers assert this is merely a rebranding of a force established by eliminated Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, consisting of 'thugs' from Jabalia recruited to eliminate the organization's opponents. Palestinian media sources state that the unit's mission is to 'confront merchants who inflate prices, swindlers, thugs, and armed criminal gangs.' The unit has been operating for several weeks and has reportedly killed dozens of gang members. This morning alone, two unit members were killed during a raid on a Jargoun area gang compound in Khan Younis, where the gang was trading in smuggled cigarettes. Five gang members were killed in the raid, with footage of the confrontation spreading across social media. Hamas terrorists ride on top of a humanitarian aid truck in Rafah, Gaza Strip, Dec. 19, 2023. Photo credit: AP AP Saham unit operatives employ all the terrorist organization's characteristic methods. They move in civilian clothes to avoid IDF detection, wearing masks. Unit members have been documented executing civilians, beating them with iron rods, and even firing RPG rockets at smugglers' vehicles. For many Gaza residents suffering from dramatic price increases, the unit's actions serve as a release valve for anger and helplessness, but for many others, it represents outright terror. The attention given to the Saham unit also underscores the central struggle for control over Gaza – it appears that even Hamas recognizes that whoever controls the flow of aid to Gaza's residents will control the Gaza Strip when the fighting subsides.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/25/how-does-hamas-keep-its-grip-on-gazas-aid/	2024-11-25T03:04:36-08:00	
Khamenei: Netanyahu deserves execution	In an escalation of rhetoric, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei suggested Sunday that the International Criminal Court in The Hague should pursue capital punishment rather than arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The remarks came during Khamenei's address to members of the Basij force, a paramilitary organization known for its role in internal security operations and suppression of domestic opposition in Iran. International Criminal Court Prosecutor Karim Khan (Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP) AFP During his speech to the assembled forces, Khamenei claimed that 'Iran's Basij will certainly succeed in destroying the Zionist regime in one day.' He continued with rhetoric against Israeli military operations, stating, 'Bombing homes in Lebanon and Gaza is not victory. They are foolish if they think that bombing homes, hospitals, and gatherings constitutes victory. No one sees this as victory.' 'What the Zionists are doing is a war crime,' Khamenei told his forces, referring to existing ICC warrants before adding, 'but that's not enough. They must issue a death sentence for Netanyahu. This criminal leader must receive a death sentence.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/25/khamenei-netanyahu-deserves-execution-not-mere-arrest-warrant/	2024-11-24T22:30:45-08:00	
Body of missing Chabad rabbi found in UAE	UAE authorities confirmed Sunday the death of Rabbi Zvi Kogan, a Chabad-Lubavitch emissary whose disappearance last week sparked international concern.

Report: Iran-West nuclear talks to resume in Geneva	Kyodo News, Japan's leading news agency, reported Sunday that nuclear negotiations between Iran and Western powers are set to resume next month, as the eighth round of talks between the two sides has been on hold for more than 3 years. According to the Japanese news outlet, Iranian officials are expected to meet with representatives from Britain, France, and Germany in Geneva, Switzerland.

Chabad emissary missing in UAE, Israel suspects Iranian involveme...	Rabbi Tzvi Kogen, the Chabad emissary in Abu Dhabi, has been missing since last Thursday, with no communication since then. Over recent days, as the investigation into his disappearance intensifies, concerns are growing that he may have been kidnapped or killed. Reports suggest that hostile elements might be related, and Iranian involvement is also under investigation. Israeli authorities are investigating potential connections between Kogen's disappearance and terrorist organizations. His family alerted security officials that he had not been in contact for several days, prompting the immediate launch of a joint investigation with the Mossad and UAE security forces.

In recent days, as multiple parties work to uncover leads in the Chabad emissary's disappearance, fears have surfaced that hostile elements had been monitoring him before he vanished. The possibility that this was a nationalist-motivated attack is now being closely examined, with the investigation focusing on this scenario.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/20/chabad-emissary-missing-in-uae-israel-suspects-iranian-involvement/	2024-11-20T08:13:27-08:00

The Trump effect? Turkey pitches Gaza hostage talks	Turkey has launched a fresh diplomatic initiative to broker the release of Israeli hostages held by the Hamas terror group, Al-Araby Al-Jadeed reported, marking a potential shift in regional dynamics amid speculation about former President Trump's influence on Middle Eastern politics. According to a high-ranking Hamas source, Turkish authorities extended an invitation to the Israeli government to resume negotiations that could potentially lead to the conclusion of the Gaza war and the return of the 101 Israelis that have been held hostage in Gaza for over a year. The source indicated that Ankara has positioned itself to facilitate direct communications with Hamas leadership. The official, however, stated that Prime Minister Benjamin 'Netanyahu derailed the Turkish initiative in its early stages by rejecting both Turkish mediation and Ankara's role as an intermediary in the Gaza situation.' Israelis rallying for the release of the hostages held by the Hamas terrorist organization in the Gaza Strip (Gideon Markowicz) Gideon Markowicz The report said that Shin Bet security agency director, Ronen Bar, conducted an undisclosed visit to Turkey on Saturday, meeting with Turkey's intelligence director to discuss the status of hostages in Gaza. According to Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, Bar's presence at the meeting was primarily to evaluate the Turkish proposal. Sources indicated that the diplomatic engagement followed patterns similar to Israel's approach since the conflict's onset, characterized as 'delaying tactics to gain time' and utilizing the initiative to address domestic pressure within Israel. A senior Israeli diplomatic official told Israel Hayom that Netanyahu had authorized Ronen's Turkey visit to explore potential hostage release arrangements and discuss bilateral relations. The visit's timing comes as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to return to the White House with his pro-Israel team. The Turkish diplomatic overture indicates a significant shift in President Erdogan's position, reflecting an understanding of potential changes in Washington's diplomatic stance. While Turkey continues to serve as a base for senior Hamas officials, Israel is exploring this new channel for hostage recovery, parallel to existing mediation efforts.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/20/the-trump-effect-turkey-steps-forward-with-gaza-hostage-initiative/	2024-11-20T00:50:45-08:00	
Security Council to vote on Gaza ceasefire as US stance unclear	The United Nations Security Council will convene Wednesday to vote on a resolution for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.

Washington's stance on the measure remains uncertain. The United Nations Security Council (Johannes Eisele/AFP) Johannes Eisele/AFP Previously, in June, the United States successfully shepherded through the Security Council a resolution that called for both a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages. While Security Council resolutions currently serve as declarations without immediate enforcement power over Israel, the council retains the authority to implement various measures, including the potential imposition of sanctions. The current Gaza war broke out on Oct. 7, when Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel, killing over 1,000 Israelis and taking over 250 kidnapped.

IDF warns of 'Sabra and Shatila scenario' in debate over US-manag...	A crucial meeting convened yesterday (Monday) by Defense Minister Israel Katz with top IDF brass focused on overhauling humanitarian aid distribution methods in Gaza to circumvent Hamas control. The discussions centered on a controversial proposal to allow a US private security firm to manage civilian affairs and aid distribution in designated Gaza neighborhoods, with the IDF maintaining only peripheral security operations. The high-level gathering included IDF Operations Chief Major General Oded Basyuk, Strategy and Third-Circle Directorate Head Major General Eliezer Toledano, the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, and additional military officials. The senior command presented a comprehensive analysis of the plan's merits and potential pitfalls, highlighting several critical concerns. In a particularly pointed intervention, Major General Toledano issued a stark warning, invoking the specter of a 'Sabra and Shatila' scenario. He cautioned that any civilian casualties caused by the private company's operations in Gaza neighborhoods could be attributed to the IDF, given its presence in the area, potentially triggering international backlash. Displaced Palestinians make their way as they flee Hamad City following an Israeli evacuation order, amid the Israel-Hamas conflict, in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip on August 11, 2024. Photo credit: Reuters/Hatem Khaled REUTERS The historical parallel references the aftermath of the First Lebanon War, when Christian forces, operating under IDF security perimeter, entered the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. While their stated mission targeted PLO fighters, the operation resulted in civilian casualties, leading to widespread international condemnation of Israel as the overseeing force. Defense Minister Katz pushed back against these comparisons, emphasizing the fundamental difference between a professional American security company and the historical events involving Christian factions at Sabra and Shatila, dismissing any parallel between the two scenarios. The concerns voiced by Toledano resonated with other participants, including the head of the International Law Department in the Military Advocate General's Corps, who shared similar reservations about introducing a US private security company into the humanitarian aid operation. Earlier reporting revealed an additional legal complexity: if Israel finances the American company's civilian operations in Gaza neighborhoods, international law could view it as an extension of Israeli authority. To navigate this challenge, officials are exploring alternative funding through foreign nations or international aid organizations. Member of the Security Cabinet, Minister of National Missions Orit Strock offered a stark assessment: 'Each day that humanitarian aid continues to sustain Hamas represents another cycle of self-defeating actions that undermine our war objectives, endanger our soldiers, and compromise our hostages. This paradox cannot continue.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/19/idf-warns-of-sabra-and-shatila-scenario-in-debate-over-us-managed-gaza-aid/	2024-11-19T10:07:13-08:00

Doyle, who had previously expressed support for the Oct. 7 attack, avoided eye contact throughout much of Yanai's testimony. 'We went to dance. We didn't attack,' Yanai said of the festival, as Doyle shook his head. 'Don't get annoyed. I'm really asking you as a person, do you support those actions? If you didn't support those actions and October 7th didn't happen, would we sit here, talking right now?' Doyle replied: 'Well yeah, actually, we probably would be.' Yanai described how her ordeal began when she broke her leg while trying to escape through the desert near Mount Negev. She recounted the horror of being taken into Gaza, where she witnessed civilians celebrating her capture despite her visible injuries. 'When I was entering Gaza I saw 100 percent of civilians celebrating me being taken,' she said, describing her broken leg and extensive bruising. 'I didn't know about the other hostages, I thought it was only me.' Her family learned of her kidnapping through a viral TikTok video discovered by her 12-year-old niece, which showed Yanai pleading for her life as her captors shouted in the background. During her 54-day captivity, Yanai was moved between seven heavily guarded locations where she faced constant surveillance, limited access to food and water, and needed permission to use bathroom facilities. She revealed that her captors told her they 'planned to move on and kill as much as they could and slaughter everybody,' unaware that 3,000 people were present at the festival. Nearly 400 festival attendees were killed in the attack. they brought a hostage to a debate — Aidan Doyle (@aidandoyleee) November 18, 2024 Yanai was released last November as part of a hostage exchange agreement. Despite the trauma she endured, she emphasized her desire for dialogue and understanding, telling Doyle, 'I really want to hear your side, that's my agenda, of co-existing.' Currently, 101 hostages remain in captivity in Gaza. Following the debate, Doyle took to X (formerly known as Twitter) dismissively commenting on Yanai's presence, writing 'They brought a hostage to a debate.' Hassan Yousef later offered a scathing critique of Doyle's performance, saying mockingly, 'He came really prepared. He memorized the narrative, even perfected it more than those who had been claiming it for 70 years. He knows a lot more than Yasser Arafat on Palestine.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/19/former-hamas-hostage-confronts-ucla-protest-leader-in-campus-debate/	2024-11-19T06:00:25-08:00
