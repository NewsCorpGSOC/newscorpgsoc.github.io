How Israel kept the hostages in its heart through 2024	2024 was undoubtedly marked by the resounding call to 'Bring them home.' These 365 days, perhaps the longest in the nation's history, saw Israeli citizens adamantly refuse to leave the hostages behind. Media outlets, family members, and countless citizens joined forces to keep public attention focused on the hostages' plight. In a year of unprecedented turmoil, many continued their daily struggle for the freedom of their brothers and sisters held captive in Gaza by enemy forces. As the new year approaches, Israelis must reflect on twelve months of diverse initiatives: from public demonstrations to powerful speeches and compelling exhibits – each effort, though yet to achieve its ultimate goal, strengthening the collective resolve. One hundred men, women, and children remain in captivity, possibly unaware that another year has passed.

From Olympic venues to cultural festivals, even appearing on holiday treats in bakery windows, these yellow markers became deeply embedded in the national consciousness. Nearly every public event throughout the year included at least a mention of those still waiting to come back home in Gaza. Town squares across Israel transformed into visual testimonials, gradually filling with portraits of the hostages and calls for their return. The imagery became so pervasive that it reshaped the character of many cities, with local residents turning their public spaces into monuments of solidarity with the hostages' families.

These vacant seats, often paired with hostage photographs, appeared in locations nationwide – from city squares to urban centers to ordinary streets – each chair standing empty, waiting for them to come home. Public demonstrations, though sometimes controversial, maintained consistent pressure throughout the year. Weekly gatherings at Hostages Square and other locations kept the issue at the forefront of national dialogue.

They organized massive marches in Tel Aviv, blocked roads, lit bonfires, spray-painted protest slogans, and set up stages where people spoke about bringing the hostages home. These rallies drew support from government ministers, artists, and other public figures. Israelis demonstrating for the release of the hostages held in Gaza on Sept. 1, 2024.

Citizens created human displays, and sculptures, and reimagined everyday objects as symbols of protest. Notable projects included yellow shirt displays, a 98-foot replica of a Hamas tunnel, coordinated vehicle processions, and torch installations commemorating the casualties of the Iron Swords War.

20 killed in clashes between new regime, Assad loyalists in Syria	A Syrian activist from Aleppo supporting the new government revealed to Israel Hayom that recent clashes erupting across western Syria are being orchestrated by pro-Iranian elements. 'The demonstrations were contained and specific. Participants included minority groups, former regime loyalists, Iranian supporters, and suspected war criminals. These protests were organized to provoke a civil war, following Supreme Leader Khamenei's statement threatening Syria's stability,' explained the resident of the northwestern Syrian city. Media outlets aligned with the pro-Iranian axis have deliberately amplified footage of the protests, aiming to catalyze further demonstrations that could escalate into widespread unrest. A significant Alawite minority population remains in Syria, expressing discontent with the ascension of Islamist factions to power. Simultaneously, the Christian community faces mounting tensions following provocative acts, including the burning of a Christmas tree during holiday celebrations. Syrian rebels celebrate following the takeover of Damascus, in Homs, Syria, Dec. 8, 2024 (EPA/Bilal Al Hammoud) EPA/Bilal Al Hammoud The Interior Ministry of Syria's new government confirmed that 17 security personnel lost their lives and 10 sustained injuries in an ambush by former Assad regime loyalists. The Syrian Center for Human Rights documented three armed opposition casualties in the provincial clashes. Intelligence reports indicate that Internal Security forces were attempting to apprehend a former Assad regime officer linked to operations at the notorious Saidnaya prison complex near Damascus. Syrian sources informed the center that the target was a military justice division director implicated in thousands of executions. The confrontation escalated in a Tartus province village when locals blocked security forces from conducting house searches. An Interior Ministry official disclosed to Al Jazeera that former regime members deliberately torched an Alawite prayer house. The source maintained this was calculated to ignite sectarian conflict, resulting in armed confrontations with local groups and several Internal Security force casualties. Addressing military developments, the Aleppo resident discussed Israel Defense Forces operations in southern Syria, stating, 'Syria and its people require stability to enable displaced persons to return home. Further displacement from Israeli military actions is unwanted. Following the withdrawal of Iranian militias that threatened both nations, we see no justification for continued Israeli offensive operations.' While rejecting Iranian influence, the government supporter embraces Turkish engagement: 'Syria now welcomes cooperation with all nations. Turkey's assistance in stabilizing Syria has been particularly constructive and appreciated.' The resident expressed optimism about Arab state support: 'The removal of Iranian presence, which previously obstructed solutions and deterred Arab support, has enabled humanitarian aid and development projects. Border crossings have reopened, advancing Syria's reconstruction. Arab nations are eager to see a stable, rehabilitated Syria.' Despite ongoing challenges, he emphasized feeling secure for the first time since Assad's departure and the end of 'his criminal control' over Syria.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/26/20-killed-in-clashes-between-new-regime-assad-loyalists-in-syria/	2024-12-26T00:41:27-08:00	
NY Times report says IDF expanded civilian risk protocol after Oc...	An investigation by The New York Times has revealed significant changes in Israel's military operations following the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, including expanded target selection and modified risk assessment protocols. According to the investigation, the IDF issued an order at 1 p.m. on Oct. 7, 2023, that gave mid-ranking officers expanded authority to strike Hamas targets. The change came in direct response to the morning's attacks, which killed 1,200 people and saw approximately 250 others taken hostage by the terror group. The New York Times reported that Israel increased its target range while adjusting civilian risk parameters, leading to approximately 30,000 munitions being fired into Gaza in the war's first seven weeks – surpassing the total used in the following eight months combined.

Photo credit: Jack Guez/AFP Jack Guez/AFP The report indicated that after depleting its pre-existing database of vetted targets, the IDF switched to a new artificial intelligence system for identifying targets. Instead of using detailed surveillance methods employed in previous campaigns, the military began relying on statistical models based on cellphone usage patterns to assess civilian presence. According to The New York Times, the IDF raised its civilian casualty risk threshold from previous limits of zero to five casualties to a new standard allowing up to 20 civilian casualties per strike. However, the report indicated that senior commanders occasionally approved strikes on Hamas leaders knowing they could endanger more than 100 civilians. Additionally, the military reduced its use of warning shots, known as 'roof knocks,' that traditionally gave civilians time to evacuate. The IDF responded that its forces continue to operate within legal parameters, emphasizing that the changes were necessary due to the unprecedented nature of the conflict and Hamas's tactics of operating within civilian areas.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/26/ny-times-report-says-idf-expanded-civilian-risk-protocol-after-oct-7/	2024-12-25T21:30:26-08:00	
UNSC to hold emergency session on Houthi attacks	The UN Security Council will convene next Monday in response to Israel's urgent request following the Houthi missile launch toward Israeli territory overnight between Tuesday and Wednesday. For the second consecutive night, sirens echoed across more than 200 communities throughout central Israel after an early morning launch from Yemen. IDF officials confirmed the interception of a single missile and explained that the widespread alerts were triggered by potential falling debris from the interceptor.

While that missile was also successfully intercepted, a 60-year-old woman in Tel Aviv suffered serious injuries when she struck her head while rushing to a protected space. Danny Danon, Israel's Ambassador to the UN, expressed satisfaction with the scheduled council meeting: 'The Houthis appear not to have grasped the consequences that await those who attempt to attack Israel. The Security Council must stand with Israel and condemn these attacks. I urge the council to uphold international law and establish Iran's accountability in this matter.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/25/at-israels-request-unsc-to-hold-emergency-session-on-houthi-attacks/	2024-12-24T23:50:11-08:00	
Political fashion: Al-Julani's tie as an anti-Iranian statement	Yesterday (Sunday), Syrian leader Ahmed Al-Shara—known as Abu Mohammad al-Julani—met with leaders of the Druze community in Lebanon and the Turkish foreign minister while sporting a tie. This was the first time the head of Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham was seen wearing one, making it a noteworthy event. At this point, you might be wondering if you're reading an article from Makor Rishon or a Mediterranean fashion magazine, but rest assured—relax in your seat and join us on a short journey exploring the status of ties in the Muslim world. The Taliban is well-known for imposing strict limitations on appearance and clothing in Afghanistan, particularly for women. Alongside the infamous requirement for women to wear a burqa and for men to grow beards, the Sunni terrorist organization has also banned ties. Before the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021, suits and ties were popular attire in Afghan society. Last year, senior Taliban figure Mohammad Hashim Shahid Wror declared ties to be Christian symbols and therefore forbidden in Afghanistan. Back in 2022, ties were already banned in Afghan schools. 'The history of the tie in Islam is clear. What is a tie? It's a cross. Sharia instructs us to break and destroy it,' Wror stated at the time. Wror, who heads the Taliban's guidance department, is responsible for shaping the organization's religious policies. The ban on ties is not unique to Afghanistan. Another prominent example is Muslim-majority Iran. Iranian missiles on the background of a banknote of Iranian rials (Getty Images / Anton Petrus) Getty Images After the Islamic Revolution in 1979, Iran banned the wearing and sale of ties. Religious leaders in the Shiite country viewed ties as a Christian symbol or, at the very least, as representing Western culture. Members of the Basij militia used to patrol the streets of major cities with scissors to cut ties off people's necks for years, though local authorities only partially enforced the law. At the start of the 21st century, more and more young Iranians—many of whom oppose the Ayatollah regime and its religious coercion—began wearing ties, particularly at weddings and funerals. This trend may have prompted authorities to take the ban more seriously. In 2008, Iranian customs deputy Asghar Hamidi announced that the country would prohibit the import of ties. By 2012, authorities instructed clothing stores to dispose of their tie inventories, and businesses whose logos featured ties were ordered to redesign them. A billboard featuring Nasrallah in Tehran, Iran. Photo: EPA In 2010, then-Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad caused a stir when he said that no Shiite cleric had ever officially forbidden ties, prompting rebukes from religious scholars. That same year, a uniquely Iranian tie was designed in the shape of Zulfiqar—the sword of Imam Ali, the Prophet Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law. According to Shiite belief, Ali is the second-most important figure in Islam, and his historical status is central to the Sunni-Shiite divide. This unique tie was adorned with hadith (oral traditions in Islam) and was approved for use by several senior Shiite clerics. Interestingly, the ban on ties in Iran is still enforced, albeit selectively, mostly targeting foreign visitors or residents. The prohibition on ties dates back to the Shah's era, when ties were a popular accessory in Iran. However, the Persian connection to ties has deep historical roots. British scholar Noel Malcolm argued in his book A Brief History of Bosnia that ties were first introduced to Europe from Iran during the Sasanian Empire (3rd–7th centuries CE). So, is Al-Julani's decision to wear a tie yesterday a political or fashion statement? Was it merely intended to complement his suit, or does it reflect an effort to distance himself from Islamic fundamentalism in general and Iran in particular? Perhaps the Mediterranean fashion magazine has the answers. For now, we will stay with the questions.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/25/political-fashion-al-julanis-tie-as-an-anti-iranian-statement/	2024-12-24T23:40:30-08:00	
Egypt battles online campaign aimed at stirring unrest	Egypt's State Information Service has launched an aggressive counter-campaign to combat online rumors, particularly those propagated by the Muslim Brotherhood. According to Egyptian authorities, these coordinated digital efforts aim to destabilize the nation and incite civil unrest. The Muslim Brotherhood, which has been designated as a terrorist organization in Egypt for more than a decade, remains a primary concern for security officials. Recent weeks have witnessed the widespread circulation of historical protest footage across social media platforms. The content distributors, some identifying themselves as members of the Syrian opposition or Houthi supporters from Yemen, have been sharing archival videos showing Egyptian citizens removing pro-President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi signage and crowds chanting the revolutionary slogan 'The people want to topple the regime.' This governmental response comes at a particularly sensitive time, as Cairo monitors potential regional ripple effects in the wake of the collapse of Assad's regime in Syria. Egyptian President, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi attends the closing session of the Arab League summit, in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, 29 March 2015. Photo credit: Khaled Elfiqi/EPA EPA Diaa Rashwan, chief of the State Information Service, emphasized that the campaign's primary objective is to enhance public awareness and resilience against 'purveyors of rumors and falsehoods who seek to undermine national stability, social cohesion, and public trust in state institutions.' He stressed that the initiative aims to reach every Egyptian citizen through strategic social media engagement. The state campaign, already operational under the banner 'Verify it before you believe it,' focuses on elevating public consciousness about social media misinformation. Rashwan outlined a comprehensive approach targeting all demographic segments of Egyptian society, promoting critical information verification practices before sharing content, and emphasizing the paramount importance of consulting official, authorized sources for accurate information.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/25/egypt-battles-online-campaign-aimed-at-stirring-unrest/	2024-12-24T20:00:43-08:00	
Mohammed Sinwar frustrates hostage deal mediators	Recent optimism surrounding hostage negotiations has given way to mounting frustration as Israeli officials reveal significant obstacles in their dealings with Hamas – specifically with Mohammed Sinwar's approach to the talks. Sources close to the negotiations paint a picture of deliberate obstruction, describing how Yahya Sinwar's brother has consistently misled mediators over weeks, stonewalling requests for hostage lists and withdrawing from previously reached agreements. Security and political officials expressed deep concern over Mohammed's handling of negotiations on Hamas' behalf. Two critical roadblocks persist: Hamas' continued refusal to provide a list of hostages for initial release, and disagreements over the prisoner exchange ratio and deportation terms. Demonstrators take part in a protest to show support for the hostages who were kidnapped during the deadly October 7 attack, amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, in Tel Aviv, Israel, September 4, 2024. Photo credit: REUTERS/Florion Goga REUTERS/Florion Goga Israeli officials emphasize that the hostage list represents a fundamental prerequisite for progress, and Hamas' refusal to provide it effectively prevents discussion of other contested issues. The initial optimism expressed by Israeli ministers, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has collided with Hamas' calculated approach to negotiating the hostages' fate. The war's conclusion remains another contentious point. Despite initially indicating a willingness to set aside this demand to start talks, Hamas now insists on including a pathway to end the conflict in any agreement. As reported earlier this week, security officials have privately told ministers that entering into the first phase of a deal would likely lead to its eventual completion to secure all hostages' return. Cabinet ministers appear increasingly willing to accept the heavy costs involved in such a deal, but they remain opposed to ending the war – which could once again become a major obstacle to reaching an agreement.

The positioning of IDF forces during any ceasefire also appears to have preliminary consensus. A senior cabinet minister revealed to Israel Hayom that while several issues under discussion could lead to a breakthrough, each also carries the potential to derail negotiations entirely. Both parties are mindful of Trump's upcoming January 20 inauguration, with Hamas concerned about deteriorating conditions and Israel anticipating stronger support for increasing pressure on Hamas – potentially allowing hostage recovery without current Biden administration constraints.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/24/worse-than-his-brother-mohammed-sinwar-frustrates-hostage-deal-mediators/	2024-12-24T06:26:06-08:00

Irresponsible': US ambassador Lew slams agency's Gaza famine rep...	A US government agency's dire warning about potential famine in northern Gaza has prompted an unusually strong rebuttal from US Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew, exposing a rare public disagreement over humanitarian assessments in the region. The Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) issued a report Monday night warning that 'If the food supply remains cut off from North Gaza Governorate, the combination of starvation and disease would most likely push non-trauma mortality above 2 people/10,000/day between January and March, meeting the third criterion for Famine (IPC Phase 5).' In response, Ambassador Lew issued a sharp critique: 'At a time when inaccurate information is causing confusion and accusations, it is irresponsible to issue a report like this.' FEWS NET, established by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and still partially funded by it, operates with support from NASA, the US Department of Agriculture, and other government agencies, as evidenced by USAID's logo on the FEWS NET website. This institutional backdrop makes Ambassador Lew's forceful rejection of the famine warning particularly significant. 'The report issued today on Gaza by FEWS NET relies on data that is outdated and inaccurate. We have worked closely with the Government of Israel and the UN to provide greater access to the North Governorate, and it is now apparent that the civilian population in that part of Gaza is in the range of 7,000-15,000, not 65,000-75,000 which is the basis of this report.' Trucks carrying humanitarian aid cross into the Gaza Strip from Erez crossing in southern Israel, Monday, Oct. 21, 2024. Photo credit: AP/Tsafrir Abayov AP To support his position, the senior American official referenced the Israeli Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) estimate of 5,000 to 9,000 Arab residents in northern Gaza, while noting that 'UNRWA estimates the population is between 10,000 and 15,000.' Addressing accusations about inadequate food delivery to northern Gaza, Lew emphasized, 'We work day and night with the UN and our Israeli partners to meet humanitarian needs — which are great — and relying on inaccurate data is irresponsible,' he concluded.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/24/irresponsible-us-ambassador-lew-slams-agencys-gaza-famine-report/	2024-12-23T23:45:00-08:00	
Trump, Biden aids demand Hamas free US hostages	In a powerful display of bipartisan cooperation, Robert O'Brien, former White House national security adviser under Trump, and Tom Nides, former US Ambassador to Israel under Biden, published a joint opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal Monday addressing the urgent plight of American hostages in Gaza since the Oct. 7 massacre. The authors revealed that from the twelve Americans initially taken hostage, four have been freed through negotiations, while Hersh Goldberg-Polin was murdered before Israeli forces could reach him. Seven Americans remain in Hamas captivity, including three confirmed deceased whose remains have not been returned. 'Hamas should interpret this bipartisan support as an unequivocal American unity,' O'Brien and Nides emphasized. 'Its supporters throughout the region must understand that returning our unlawfully detained citizens is a deeply rooted priority for the US government.' President-elect Donald Trump (AP/Alex Brandon) AP/Alex Brandon The officials highlighted the rare alignment between current and former presidents on this critical issue. 'President Biden and his team have been working tirelessly toward this goal,' they stated, while noting that 'President-elect Trump has issued a stark warning that the American Seven must be released before his return to office or face 'hell to pay.'' O'Brien and Nides outlined significant strategic shifts in the region, 'The strategic situation – for both the US and our close ally Israel – has markedly improved compared to a year or even a month ago.' They detailed how 'Hezbollah stands weakened, accepting a ceasefire under international supervision. Syria's regime has fallen, severely limiting Iran's ability to use it as an operational base and supply route for its proxies.' The authors specifically named each American hostage still in captivity: Edan Alexander, Itay Chen, Sagui Dekel-Chen, Gadi Haggai, Judi Weinstein Haggai, Omer Neutra and Keith Siegel. 'These families face another holiday season [Hanukkah] with an empty chair at their dinner table,' they wrote poignantly. 'Hamas and their supporters must receive this message with absolute clarity: Release the Americans in the first phase of the deal. Every single one,' they conclude firmly. 'This is the best offer Hamas will ever receive.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/24/in-rare-joint-plea-trump-biden-officials-demand-hamas-release-us-hostages/	2024-12-23T22:21:34-08:00

Pro-Iranian militias reportedly agree to stop firing on Israel	A senior figure in Iraq's pro-Iranian militia Al-Nujaba Movement (known as HHN) has confirmed that Iran's proxies in the country have reached an agreement with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' Al-Sudani to cease military operations targeting Israel in support of Gaza, the pro-Hezbollah Al-Akhbar reported on Monday. The agreement also includes maintaining silence regarding political developments in Syria, coming amid dialogue sparked by regional and international pressure to dismantle these factions and transfer their weapons to state control. Speaking to Al-Akhbar, the figure revealed that 'the factions have decided not to interfere in Syrian affairs and to monitor the situation from a distance while also awaiting the policy directions of US President-elect Donald Trump, particularly regarding the Middle East and Iran.' The source indicated that 'the Islamic Republic of Iran has granted us the freedom to decide on the Syrian scene and the control of terrorist groups such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS).' He criticized American and Israeli efforts promoting the dissolution of the Iraqi government's umbrella organization for militias, the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), describing these attempts as aimed at forcing the surrender of the resistance axis that has effectively challenged Israel over the past year. Iranian missiles on the background of a banknote of Iranian rials (Getty Images / Anton Petrus) Getty Images / Anton Petrus 'The armed factions have adhered to the Iraqi government's directives, especially after developments in Syria, where there are concerns about a scenario worse than the fall of Bashar Assad's regime, potentially leading to the resurgence of terrorism in Iraq,' the leader added. Prime Minister Al-Sudani recently dismissed suggestions about disbanding the PMF, stating in a televised interview that 'such claims are purely speculative and come from those who oppose the political process.' This came after an Iraqi official had disclosed receiving multiple international and regional requests to dismantle the PMF and transfer weapons to state control. Kazem Al-Fartousi, spokesperson for the Kata'ib Sayyid al-Shuhada Brigades, another pro-Iranian militia, told Al-Akhbar, 'Circumstances determine the positions of the factions. The principle of unity across fronts is not tied to a temporary alliance among resistance axis factions but is a matter of doctrine and conviction. Regardless of the losses, Iraqi factions have never abandoned this principle.' Al-Fartousi explained that 'the operations of the factions against Israel were linked to Hezbollah's operations in Lebanon. When a ceasefire was reached in Lebanon, the Iraqi factions also halted their operations. There are also partners in Iraq with reservations about these operations, and their perspectives must be considered.' He added, 'The situation is currently under review, and communication is ongoing among the resistance axis to coordinate positions and develop a unified vision.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/23/pro-iranian-militia-reportedly-vows-to-stop-firing-on-israel/	2024-12-23T01:20:45-08:00	
Bashar Assad going through divorce? Not so fast	In recent days, Turkish media published what appears to be false information regarding Syrian former president Bashar Assad's supposed impending divorce from his wife Asma. In response, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov issued an official statement vigorously denying 'claims circulated by Arab and foreign media outlets about Asma Assad filing for divorce.' It should be noted that the former Syrian leader's wife is battling leukemia. In the days before the Assad regime's collapse, she was staying in Moscow. This followed her husband's visit, who had to return to Damascus before fleeing when his army collapsed.

Did Trump propose new talks with Iran?	President-elect Donald Trump has extended an offer for high-level negotiations with Iran, including discussions about the nuclear file, through Omani diplomatic channels, Iran International reported Sunday, citing the Iraqi newspaper Baghdad Alyoum. Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei delivering a speech during a meeting with Iranian scientists and officials during an exhibition of the country's nuclear industry achievements in Tehran, Iran on June 11, 2023 EPA According to a source close to Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian's administration, quoted by Baghdad Alyoum, the US message conveyed a willingness to engage in direct talks and potentially forge a new nuclear agreement that would differ from the 2015 deal that Trump abandoned in 2018. The source, speaking to Baghdad Alyoum, indicated that the US administration has set an informal timeline of 'a few months' for Tehran to respond to the proposal for negotiations, which would encompass various issues, with the nuclear file taking precedence. The diplomatic overture comes as Iranian diplomat Seyyed Hossein Mousavian published an analysis in an Iranianian outlet suggesting that direct, high-level talks between the two nations could be imminent. In his article, Mousavian cautioned that while negotiations might lead to an agreement, there were no guarantees the US would maintain its commitments even if talks proved successful.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/23/did-trump-propose-new-talks-with-iran/	2024-12-22T20:38:20-08:00	
Hamas concedes military capabilities lost, shifts to other tactic...	Sources within Hamas admitted Sunday that Israel Defense Forces operations have successfully neutralized most of their military capabilities in Gaza, forcing the terrorist organization's fighters to adopt alternative tactics. Speaking to the Saudi newspaper A-Sharq Al-Awsat, Hamas sources revealed that fighters on the ground are now making decisions independently without receiving direct orders from senior command. While they still attempt to update higher-ranking officials about their plans, these communications can take hours or even days to reach what remains of Hamas's leadership in Gaza. Among the surviving senior Hamas commanders in Gaza are Mohammed Sinwar, brother of Yahya Sinwar, who has reportedly taken command of the military wing; Izz ad-Din al-Haddad, responsible for terrorists in northern Gaza; Mohammed Shabana, who served as commander of the now-disbanded Rafah Brigade; and Tawfiq Abu Naim, head of Hamas internal security apparatus. div]:bg-bg-300 [&_.ignore-pre-bg>div]:bg-transparent [&_pre]:-mr-4 md:[&_pre]:-mr-9' style='box-sizing: border-box; border-image: initial; --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: hsl(var(--accent-secondary-100)/1); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 #0000; outline-color: hsl(var(--accent-main-100)); position: relative; padding-right: 2.25rem; line-height: 1.65rem; font-family: var(--font-claude-message); border: 0px solid hsl(var(--border-100));'> _*]:min-w-0' style='box-sizing: border-box; border-image: initial; --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: hsl(var(--accent-secondary-100)/1); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 #0000; outline-color: hsl(var(--accent-main-100)); display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(1, minmax(0px, 1fr)); gap: 0.625rem; border: 0px solid hsl(var(--border-100));'> The IDF's Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee warned over the weekend that Hamas is spreading falsehoods to maintain its fighters' morale.

A large portion of the weaponry was manufactured before the war. Nevertheless, after 15 months of fighting, the terrorists have lost most of their capabilities. This process, the sources said, has occurred alongside the elimination of key Hamas figures involved in weapons production and engineering. In recent days, Hamas released footage of a drone launch toward the western Negev that was intercepted. According to Hamas, the drone was launched from eastern Khan Younis. Other footage this month showed cells of four to five terrorists planting explosive devices in shafts.

Hezbollah terrorist leader's ring gets surprise bid	Iranian media outlets reported a ring belonging to Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah was sold at a public auction for the equivalent of $16,000. It appears to be one of the rings worn by the head of the terrorist organization, who was killed in an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) strike in September. The ring worn by Nasrallah was sold for a whopping $16,000 (Arab social media) The ring was sold for $16,000, with the proceeds to be transferred to the Lebanese people. The Iranian news agency IRNA reported in October that Iran's Ofogh TV network intended to sell Nasrallah's ring at a public auction, with the revenues meant to 'go to the Lebanese people.' Mojtaba Rahmandoost, a member of Iran's Shura Council, said he received the ring as a gift from Nasrallah in February 2014 and would put it up for public auction. Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah gives a televised address at a memorial ceremony to mark one week since the killing of Wissam Tawil, a commander of Hezbollah's elite Radwan forces on January 14, 2024 Reuters / Aziz Taher Wearing rings is an ancient custom in Shiite Islam. The ring is usually worn on the right hand. Among the pro-Iran axis, the rings worn by Qassem Soleimani, slain commander of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi are particularly well-known. Soleimani was killed in January 2020. The ring was used to identify his body after the US strike. According to various reports, Raisi's body was also identified by the ring on his hand after his helicopter crashed. Similar rings are worn by Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and senior members of pro-Iranian militias in Iraq. The ring apparently symbolizes, among other things, the connection between members of the axis. A Lebanese cleric told the BBC's Arabic network that the ring is linked to several Islamic and Arab traditions. However, he notes that a person must not be attached to a stone out of a belief that it can harm or benefit them.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/22/hezbollah-terrorist-leaders-ring-gets-surprise-bid/	2024-12-22T01:19:51-08:00	
Mass grave in Syria may contain remains of 100K	According to the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a newly discovered mass grave outside Damascus potentially contains the remains of at least 100,000 people allegedly killed under the regime of former President Bashar Assad. The organization's leader, Mouaz Moustafa, told Reuters in a phone interview from Damascus that the site in al-Qutayfah, located approximately 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of the Syrian capital, is one of five mass graves he has identified through his investigations. Reuters reports that Moustafa believes the death toll at this single location could be significantly higher, describing the 100,000 figure as 'a very, very extremely almost unfairly conservative estimate.' According to his findings, the victims include not only Syrian citizens but also Americans, British nationals, and other foreigners. The discovery comes in the wake of Assad's recent ousting by rebel forces, as reported by The Associated Press. Assad, who ruled Syria for 24 years following his father's three-decade reign, has fled to Moscow where he has been granted asylum by his long-time Russian allies. An opposition fighter steps on a broken bust of the late Syrian President Hafez Assad in Damascus, Syria, Sunday Dec. 8, 2024 (AP/Hussein Malla) AP/Hussein Malla According to The Associated Press, the majority of Assad's former territory is now under the control of Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), led by former al-Qaida commander Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani. The group, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, has begun establishing a new government and initiating diplomatic relations with foreign states. The Associated Press notes that Syria has been largely inaccessible to journalists since the outbreak of civil war in 2011 due to government restrictions and ongoing violence. The recent change in leadership has allowed journalists to return, leading to new revelations about life under the Assad regime. Moustafa expressed urgent concerns about the security of the grave sites, emphasizing the importance of preserving evidence for future investigations. Human rights organizations estimate that Assad's security forces may have killed 150,000 people since 2011. Syria's UN Ambassador Koussay Aldahhak, who assumed his role while Assad was still in power, has not responded to requests for comment. In a statement released via Telegram, Assad said: 'I have carried an unwavering conviction in their will and ability to protect the state, defend its institutions, and uphold their choices to the very last moment.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/19/mass-grave-in-syria-may-contain-remains-of-100000-victims-including-americans/	2024-12-18T21:11:11-08:00	
Al-Julani rules out Afghan model for Syria	Syria's new de facto leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, declared in an exclusive BBC interview that his war-torn nation no longer poses a threat to neighboring countries or Western nations, marking a significant shift in tone from the country's new leadership. In the interview conducted in Damascus, al-Sharaa emphasized the need to lift international sanctions, arguing that the measures were designed to target the previous regime. 'The victim and the oppressor should not be treated in the same way,' he said. Al-Sharaa, also known as Abu Mohammad al-Julani, led the recent offensive that overthrew Bashar Assad's government less than two weeks ago and heads the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the dominant force in the rebel alliance. He now seeks to distance his organization from its designation as a terrorist group by the UN, US, EU, and UK. Al-Sharaa directly addressed concerns about his group's past connections to al-Qaeda, which it separated from in 2016. He insisted that HTS does not target civilians and portrayed his organization as a victim of the Assad regime's actions. Al-Sharaa rejected comparisons between his vision for Syria and Afghanistan's governance model, emphasizing Syria's distinct cultural traditions. He pointed to education initiatives in rebel-held territories, stating, 'The percentage of women in universities is more than 60%' in Idlib province, which has been under rebel control since 2011.

The interview showed al-Sharaa in civilian clothes, appearing relaxed as he attempted to reassure those skeptical about his group's break from its extremist past. Many Syrians remain unconvinced, and the actions of Syria's new rulers in the next few months will indicate the kind of country they want Syria to be – and the way they want to rule it.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/19/al-julani-gives-first-interview-to-western-media/	2024-12-18T20:30:17-08:00	
Saudis celebrate Operation White City	In the aftermath of Operation White City, Israel's strategic strike on Houthi targets in Yemen, reactions across the Arab world have revealed deep regional divisions. While Saudi commentators appeared to welcome the action, Hamas rushed to express solidarity with the Houthis, who vowed continued attacks on Israeli targets. Video: The Israeli strike in Yemen on Dec. 19, 2024 Rassan Charbel, editor at a leading Saudi newspaper, penned a pointed commentary this morning: 'Netanyahu, at his most imperious, gazes across the region from Mount Hermon before dispatching his aircraft to strike Houthi positions in Yemen. What must Tehran be thinking as it witnesses Israeli strikes on Sanaa this morning? Do these fresh Israeli strikes on Yemen represent one of the final communications to Iran?' On social media platform X, IDF Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee crafted an acrostic spelling out 'Sanaa,' cleverly mimicking and mocking the Houthi spokespersons' practice of writing targeted Israeli locations in the same style. ص ن ع ا ء — افيخاي ادرعي (@AvichayAdraee) December 19, 2024 When senior Houthi official Mohammed Ali al-Houthi decried the Israeli strike as a 'war crime,' Adraee responded with sharp irony: 'He attacked me and cried. He preceded me and complained.' Hamas issued a strong condemnation of Israel's attack on Houthi positions in Yemen. 'We stand in complete solidarity with Yemen and our brothers in the Ansarallah movement as they face Zionist, American, and British aggression,' the organization declared in an official statement. Within Yemen, Houthi activist Mohammed bin Radwan asserted that Saudi commentators were celebrating what he termed 'the Israeli-Saudi strike on the capital, Sanaa.' Saudi activist Abdul Rahman al-Otaibi countered with derision: 'Where is Israel? How could it be attacking Sanaa? You claimed victory over the US and Israel just a year ago, and now you position yourselves as victims.'

He specified these as 'Palestine-2' hypersonic missiles, adding that the launches were synchronized with 'the Israeli strike on civilian facilities in Sanaa and Hodeidah province, including power stations.' The spokesperson issued a warning that they would 'respond to this brutal aggression while maintaining support for Gaza and targeting all hostile positions with appropriate weaponry.' He emphasized that the Israeli strike would not prevent them from fulfilling their obligation to respond to the ongoing conflict in Gaza.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/19/saudis-celebrate-operation-white-city/	2024-12-18T18:30:38-08:00	
US pressures Iraq to dismantle pro-Iranian militias	The London-based newspaper Al-Arab reported on Wednesday that the US seeks to capitalize on Hezbollah's defeat in Lebanon and the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria. According to the report, American officials are pressuring the Iraqi government to move forward with dismantling pro-Iranian militias. Much of this pressure is directed at Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' Al-Sudani. Iraqi sources indicated that Al-Sudani finds himself in a difficult position following a recent meeting with a delegation led by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Blinken reportedly called on him to take swift and decisive action against these militias. The primary demand, according to these sources, is for the Iraqi government to pass a resolution mandating the immediate disbandment of the militias and to target any group refusing to surrender its weapons to the state. On this issue, the US has emphasized zero tolerance for flexibility. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' Al-Sudani. Photo: Reuters Blinken's secret visit to Baghdad last Friday, during which he urged Iraq to adopt hardline measures against pro-Iranian militias, reportedly came just days after the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria. This push to dismantle the militias is part of a broader effort to weaken Iran's strategy, which relies heavily on terrorist organizations across different regions to consolidate its influence. However, Al-Arab clarified that dismantling these militias would require a fatwa from Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's most senior Shiite cleric. Such a fatwa seems unlikely, given recent foreign engagements with al-Sistani, including meetings with UN representatives. The report noted that UN representative Mohammed Al-Hassan held discussions with al-Sistani about potential steps to distance Iraq from conflicts and crises that could impact the country. Al-Hassan emphasized the precarious state of the region and expressed hope that Iraq's leadership could navigate the nation away from the entanglements of the broader regional conflict. Antony Blinken. Photo: EPA Iraqi sources revealed that some militias were informed of the US position and have begun preparing statements signaling their intent to distance themselves from Iran. These declarations reportedly underscore their commitment to Iraq's official policy of non-intervention in Syria. Nonetheless, fully dismantling these militias or relinquishing their weaponry remains a challenging prospect, even if it could shield them from potential strikes by Israel or the US. It's worth noting that while US pressure has intensified, the pro-Iranian militias in Iraq have refrained from launching drones toward Israel in recent weeks.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/18/us-pressures-iraq-to-dismantle-pro-iranian-militias/	2024-12-18T02:00:04-08:00	
Call between Israeli, Australian ministers takes ugly turn	Amid escalating antisemitism in Australia, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar and Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong engaged in a heated phone call on Tuesday. The discussion, initially aimed at improving bilateral relations, quickly escalated into a direct clash of viewpoints on Gaza. Gideon Sa'ar (Ancho Gosh / JINI) Ancho Gosh / JINI Wong, known for her alignment with anti-Israel voices within the ruling Australian Labor Party, accused Israel of failing to provide sufficient humanitarian aid for Gaza's Palestinian residents. Sa'ar refuted her claims, emphasizing that Israel had endured a large-scale assault on October 7 not just by Hamas but also by five additional entities, some of which do not even share borders with the country. 'Australia chose to distance itself from Israel during the most challenging year in its modern history,' Sa'ar said, condemning Australia's weakened international support for Israel. He further criticized Wong's recent inclusion of Israel alongside Russia and China as part of the same ilk. 'Israel is a Western democracy with robust rule of law, an independent judiciary, and adherence to international standards,' he stated. Sa'ar also protested the recent incident in which former Israeli minister Ayelet Shaked was refused entry into Australia, calling it a diplomatic affront. 'How would Australians respond if we treated one of their former ministers this way?' he asked. Shaked's invitation to a conference hosted by Australia Israel & Jewish Affairs Council (AIJAC) was seen as an effort to strengthen ties between the two nations, making the rejection unprecedented for a figure of her political standing. Reports suggest the visa denial stemmed from her opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state. Addressing the broader issue of antisemitism, Sa'ar expressed concern over the recent arson attack on Melbourne's historic Adass Israel Synagogue, a symbol of resilience for the city's Jewish community. 'Israel expects decisive action from Australia,' he declared. Benjamin Klein, a synagogue board member, described the attack as deeply shocking. 'Our community has been on high alert with security patrols and cameras, but seeing this level of destruction is heart-wrenching,' he said.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/18/call-between-israeli-australia-ministers-takes-ugly-turn/	2024-12-17T15:23:26-08:00	
Are Israel, Hamas near 'almost final' stage of talks?	Palestinian sources told the Saudi news channel Asharq on Tuesday that current discussions regarding a ceasefire and hostage deal have reached an advanced, 'almost final' stage, particularly those taking place in Qatar. According to the report, Qatari and Egyptian mediators are working with Israeli and Hamas technical teams to finalize details of the hostage deal and ceasefire through agreed-upon implementation mechanisms that will be under international supervision. Protesters demand a deal to secure the release of Hamas-held hostages AFP / Jack Guez The sources said the agreement between the parties would be executed in three phases. The first phase would be a 'humanitarian stage' including additional supply deliveries to the Gaza Strip and the release of all Israeli female hostages, including female soldiers, as well as civilian hostages. Furthermore, according to the report, the agreement would conclude in its final stage with a permanent ceasefire and complete Israel Defense Forces withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, including the Philadelphi Route and Netzarim Route. Asharq noted that the IDF would maintain six points in Gaza during the first two phases. Gaza's rebuilding efforts would begin afterward. According to the report, the first two phases would include the release of hostages in exchange for hundreds of prisoners. The ceasefire would likely be gradual, spread across three phases. It was also noted that the first phase would last six weeks. During this phase, it was reported that IDF forces would withdraw from part of the Philadelphi Route to the eastern side of the Rafah crossing. A partial withdrawal from the Netzarim Route and Gaza population centers was also reported. Additionally, it was reported that under the agreement, Gaza residents would be allowed to return to Gaza City and northern Gaza Strip under a military supervision mechanism intended to ensure Hamas operatives do not enter the area. Reports emerged during the day that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was heading to Cairo for talks about the developing deal, though his office denied these reports. Meanwhile, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas was invited for talks in Cairo to discuss developments in the contacts and new arrangements taking shape in the region.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/17/progress-reported-in-gaza-hostage-deal-talks-as-sides-near-agreement/	2024-12-17T07:04:24-08:00

However, according to Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz, Hamas has demonstrated a willingness to compromise on these matters. 'The Philadelphi and Netzarim routes are no longer an obstacle; Hamas has shown flexibility on these matters,' Katz said during a Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee session. Israel has also reportedly softened its stance on certain conditions as negotiators work to establish an inspection mechanism for civilians moving northward – a system that Hamas had previously rejected. The Israeli government official stated that the talks have focused on bridging gaps to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. In a related development, Reuters reported that an Israeli delegation has traveled to Doha to continue the dialogue, signaling the seriousness of both parties to reach a resolution.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/17/israel-hamas-poised-to-conclude-deal-as-pm-reportedly-in-cairo/	2024-12-17T06:20:26-08:00	
Hamas capitulates hostage stance amid growing pressure	Hamas has demonstrated increased flexibility in peace negotiations, offering key concessions in a new proposal for a 60-day pause in fighting and hostage exchanges, The Washington Post reported Sunday. The militant group has retreated from previous demands for a complete halt to the war and full withdrawal of Israeli forces, according to a Hamas official who spoke to The Washington Post on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Progress has also been made regarding the number of hostages Israel demands in the first phase. The number includes, as mediated, adults over 50, those who are ill, and all who qualify as 'humanitarian cases' in exchange for six weeks of ceasefire. In a sign of diplomatic movement, Hamas recently provided Israel with names of living hostages through Egyptian intermediaries, according to a former Egyptian official who spoke to The Washington Post anonymously due to the sensitive nature of the negotiations. On Monday, Defense Minister Israel Katz said, 'There will be overwhelming support for the deal that's on the table, we're closer than we've ever been.' Supporters gather for a demonstration calling upon the US to intervene for the release of the hostages in Gaza, outside the US Embassy branch office in Tel Aviv on December 12, 2024 (Photo: Jack Guez / AFP) AFP The shift comes as Hamas faces growing pressure from Palestinians in Gaza, who are increasingly critical of the group as they struggle with displacement, hunger, and continued Israeli military operations after more than 14 months of conflict. A recent proposal includes provisions for exchanging Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, though Hamas maintains its insistence that displaced Palestinians be allowed to return to northern Gaza, the official told The Washington Post. The organization's military capabilities have been significantly reduced, according to Tahani Mustafa, senior Palestine analyst at the International Crisis Group, though she noted Hamas 'has shown that it has the capacity to maintain a long-term insurgency.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected any postwar role for Hamas in Gaza and dismissed the possibility of the Palestinian Authority's return to the territory. Meanwhile, some members of his far-right coalition are advocating for annexation and resettlement of the enclave. Public support for Hamas in Gaza has declined sharply, with satisfaction in the group's performance dropping to 39% in September from 64% in June, according to polling by the Ramallah-based Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research. Netanyahu said Thursday that Israeli forces had killed 'close to 20,000' Hamas fighters. The IDF conducted operations that resulted in the deaths of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran in July and military leader Yahya Sinwar in southern Gaza in October. Some analysts suggest Hamas is attempting to balance acknowledgment of public discontent while maintaining its position as the face of resistance against Israel. 'Hamas realizes that it will be out of the governance picture for a long time,' but will remain entrenched as 'an idea, an ideology, an active political party in Palestinian mainstream politics,' said Tamer Qarmout, a Gazan professor of public policy at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/17/hamas-capitulates-hostage-stance-amid-growing-pressure/	2024-12-17T04:36:58-08:00
