20 killed in clashes between new regime, Assad loyalists in Syria	A Syrian activist from Aleppo supporting the new government revealed to Israel Hayom that recent clashes erupting across western Syria are being orchestrated by pro-Iranian elements. 'The demonstrations were contained and specific. Participants included minority groups, former regime loyalists, Iranian supporters, and suspected war criminals. These protests were organized to provoke a civil war, following Supreme Leader Khamenei's statement threatening Syria's stability,' explained the resident of the northwestern Syrian city. Media outlets aligned with the pro-Iranian axis have deliberately amplified footage of the protests, aiming to catalyze further demonstrations that could escalate into widespread unrest. A significant Alawite minority population remains in Syria, expressing discontent with the ascension of Islamist factions to power. Simultaneously, the Christian community faces mounting tensions following provocative acts, including the burning of a Christmas tree during holiday celebrations.

The Syrian Center for Human Rights documented three armed opposition casualties in the provincial clashes. Intelligence reports indicate that Internal Security forces were attempting to apprehend a former Assad regime officer linked to operations at the notorious Saidnaya prison complex near Damascus. Syrian sources informed the center that the target was a military justice division director implicated in thousands of executions. The confrontation escalated in a Tartus province village when locals blocked security forces from conducting house searches. An Interior Ministry official disclosed to Al Jazeera that former regime members deliberately torched an Alawite prayer house. The source maintained this was calculated to ignite sectarian conflict, resulting in armed confrontations with local groups and several Internal Security force casualties. Addressing military developments, the Aleppo resident discussed Israel Defense Forces operations in southern Syria, stating, 'Syria and its people require stability to enable displaced persons to return home. Further displacement from Israeli military actions is unwanted. Following the withdrawal of Iranian militias that threatened both nations, we see no justification for continued Israeli offensive operations.' While rejecting Iranian influence, the government supporter embraces Turkish engagement: 'Syria now welcomes cooperation with all nations. Turkey's assistance in stabilizing Syria has been particularly constructive and appreciated.' The resident expressed optimism about Arab state support: 'The removal of Iranian presence, which previously obstructed solutions and deterred Arab support, has enabled humanitarian aid and development projects. Border crossings have reopened, advancing Syria's reconstruction. Arab nations are eager to see a stable, rehabilitated Syria.' Despite ongoing challenges, he emphasized feeling secure for the first time since Assad's departure and the end of 'his criminal control' over Syria.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/26/20-killed-in-clashes-between-new-regime-assad-loyalists-in-syria/	2024-12-26T00:41:27-08:00	
NY Times report says IDF expanded civilian risk protocol after Oc...	An investigation by The New York Times has revealed significant changes in Israel's military operations following the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, including expanded target selection and modified risk assessment protocols. According to the investigation, the IDF issued an order at 1 p.m. on Oct. 7, 2023, that gave mid-ranking officers expanded authority to strike Hamas targets. The change came in direct response to the morning's attacks, which killed 1,200 people and saw approximately 250 others taken hostage by the terror group. The New York Times reported that Israel increased its target range while adjusting civilian risk parameters, leading to approximately 30,000 munitions being fired into Gaza in the war's first seven weeks – surpassing the total used in the following eight months combined.

Photo credit: Jack Guez/AFP Jack Guez/AFP The report indicated that after depleting its pre-existing database of vetted targets, the IDF switched to a new artificial intelligence system for identifying targets. Instead of using detailed surveillance methods employed in previous campaigns, the military began relying on statistical models based on cellphone usage patterns to assess civilian presence. According to The New York Times, the IDF raised its civilian casualty risk threshold from previous limits of zero to five casualties to a new standard allowing up to 20 civilian casualties per strike. However, the report indicated that senior commanders occasionally approved strikes on Hamas leaders knowing they could endanger more than 100 civilians. Additionally, the military reduced its use of warning shots, known as 'roof knocks,' that traditionally gave civilians time to evacuate. The IDF responded that its forces continue to operate within legal parameters, emphasizing that the changes were necessary due to the unprecedented nature of the conflict and Hamas's tactics of operating within civilian areas.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/26/ny-times-report-says-idf-expanded-civilian-risk-protocol-after-oct-7/	2024-12-25T21:30:26-08:00	
UNSC to hold emergency session on Houthi attacks	The UN Security Council will convene next Monday in response to Israel's urgent request following the Houthi missile launch toward Israeli territory overnight between Tuesday and Wednesday. For the second consecutive night, sirens echoed across more than 200 communities throughout central Israel after an early morning launch from Yemen. IDF officials confirmed the interception of a single missile and explained that the widespread alerts were triggered by potential falling debris from the interceptor.

While that missile was also successfully intercepted, a 60-year-old woman in Tel Aviv suffered serious injuries when she struck her head while rushing to a protected space. Danny Danon, Israel's Ambassador to the UN, expressed satisfaction with the scheduled council meeting: 'The Houthis appear not to have grasped the consequences that await those who attempt to attack Israel. The Security Council must stand with Israel and condemn these attacks. I urge the council to uphold international law and establish Iran's accountability in this matter.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/25/at-israels-request-unsc-to-hold-emergency-session-on-houthi-attacks/	2024-12-24T23:50:11-08:00	
Political fashion: Al-Julani's tie as an anti-Iranian statement	Yesterday (Sunday), Syrian leader Ahmed Al-Shara—known as Abu Mohammad al-Julani—met with leaders of the Druze community in Lebanon and the Turkish foreign minister while sporting a tie. This was the first time the head of Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham was seen wearing one, making it a noteworthy event. At this point, you might be wondering if you're reading an article from Makor Rishon or a Mediterranean fashion magazine, but rest assured—relax in your seat and join us on a short journey exploring the status of ties in the Muslim world. The Taliban is well-known for imposing strict limitations on appearance and clothing in Afghanistan, particularly for women. Alongside the infamous requirement for women to wear a burqa and for men to grow beards, the Sunni terrorist organization has also banned ties. Before the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021, suits and ties were popular attire in Afghan society. Last year, senior Taliban figure Mohammad Hashim Shahid Wror declared ties to be Christian symbols and therefore forbidden in Afghanistan. Back in 2022, ties were already banned in Afghan schools. 'The history of the tie in Islam is clear. What is a tie? It's a cross. Sharia instructs us to break and destroy it,' Wror stated at the time. Wror, who heads the Taliban's guidance department, is responsible for shaping the organization's religious policies. The ban on ties is not unique to Afghanistan. Another prominent example is Muslim-majority Iran. Iranian missiles on the background of a banknote of Iranian rials (Getty Images / Anton Petrus) Getty Images After the Islamic Revolution in 1979, Iran banned the wearing and sale of ties. Religious leaders in the Shiite country viewed ties as a Christian symbol or, at the very least, as representing Western culture. Members of the Basij militia used to patrol the streets of major cities with scissors to cut ties off people's necks for years, though local authorities only partially enforced the law. At the start of the 21st century, more and more young Iranians—many of whom oppose the Ayatollah regime and its religious coercion—began wearing ties, particularly at weddings and funerals. This trend may have prompted authorities to take the ban more seriously. In 2008, Iranian customs deputy Asghar Hamidi announced that the country would prohibit the import of ties. By 2012, authorities instructed clothing stores to dispose of their tie inventories, and businesses whose logos featured ties were ordered to redesign them. A billboard featuring Nasrallah in Tehran, Iran. Photo: EPA In 2010, then-Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad caused a stir when he said that no Shiite cleric had ever officially forbidden ties, prompting rebukes from religious scholars. That same year, a uniquely Iranian tie was designed in the shape of Zulfiqar—the sword of Imam Ali, the Prophet Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law. According to Shiite belief, Ali is the second-most important figure in Islam, and his historical status is central to the Sunni-Shiite divide. This unique tie was adorned with hadith (oral traditions in Islam) and was approved for use by several senior Shiite clerics. Interestingly, the ban on ties in Iran is still enforced, albeit selectively, mostly targeting foreign visitors or residents. The prohibition on ties dates back to the Shah's era, when ties were a popular accessory in Iran. However, the Persian connection to ties has deep historical roots. British scholar Noel Malcolm argued in his book A Brief History of Bosnia that ties were first introduced to Europe from Iran during the Sasanian Empire (3rd–7th centuries CE). So, is Al-Julani's decision to wear a tie yesterday a political or fashion statement? Was it merely intended to complement his suit, or does it reflect an effort to distance himself from Islamic fundamentalism in general and Iran in particular? Perhaps the Mediterranean fashion magazine has the answers. For now, we will stay with the questions.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/25/political-fashion-al-julanis-tie-as-an-anti-iranian-statement/	2024-12-24T23:40:30-08:00	
Egypt battles online campaign aimed at stirring unrest	Egypt's State Information Service has launched an aggressive counter-campaign to combat online rumors, particularly those propagated by the Muslim Brotherhood. According to Egyptian authorities, these coordinated digital efforts aim to destabilize the nation and incite civil unrest. The Muslim Brotherhood, which has been designated as a terrorist organization in Egypt for more than a decade, remains a primary concern for security officials. Recent weeks have witnessed the widespread circulation of historical protest footage across social media platforms. The content distributors, some identifying themselves as members of the Syrian opposition or Houthi supporters from Yemen, have been sharing archival videos showing Egyptian citizens removing pro-President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi signage and crowds chanting the revolutionary slogan 'The people want to topple the regime.' This governmental response comes at a particularly sensitive time, as Cairo monitors potential regional ripple effects in the wake of the collapse of Assad's regime in Syria. Egyptian President, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi attends the closing session of the Arab League summit, in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, 29 March 2015. Photo credit: Khaled Elfiqi/EPA EPA Diaa Rashwan, chief of the State Information Service, emphasized that the campaign's primary objective is to enhance public awareness and resilience against 'purveyors of rumors and falsehoods who seek to undermine national stability, social cohesion, and public trust in state institutions.' He stressed that the initiative aims to reach every Egyptian citizen through strategic social media engagement. The state campaign, already operational under the banner 'Verify it before you believe it,' focuses on elevating public consciousness about social media misinformation. Rashwan outlined a comprehensive approach targeting all demographic segments of Egyptian society, promoting critical information verification practices before sharing content, and emphasizing the paramount importance of consulting official, authorized sources for accurate information.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/25/egypt-battles-online-campaign-aimed-at-stirring-unrest/	2024-12-24T20:00:43-08:00	
Mohammed Sinwar frustrates hostage deal mediators	Recent optimism surrounding hostage negotiations has given way to mounting frustration as Israeli officials reveal significant obstacles in their dealings with Hamas – specifically with Mohammed Sinwar's approach to the talks. Sources close to the negotiations paint a picture of deliberate obstruction, describing how Yahya Sinwar's brother has consistently misled mediators over weeks, stonewalling requests for hostage lists and withdrawing from previously reached agreements. Security and political officials expressed deep concern over Mohammed's handling of negotiations on Hamas' behalf. Two critical roadblocks persist: Hamas' continued refusal to provide a list of hostages for initial release, and disagreements over the prisoner exchange ratio and deportation terms. Demonstrators take part in a protest to show support for the hostages who were kidnapped during the deadly October 7 attack, amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, in Tel Aviv, Israel, September 4, 2024. Photo credit: REUTERS/Florion Goga REUTERS/Florion Goga Israeli officials emphasize that the hostage list represents a fundamental prerequisite for progress, and Hamas' refusal to provide it effectively prevents discussion of other contested issues. The initial optimism expressed by Israeli ministers, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has collided with Hamas' calculated approach to negotiating the hostages' fate. The war's conclusion remains another contentious point. Despite initially indicating a willingness to set aside this demand to start talks, Hamas now insists on including a pathway to end the conflict in any agreement. As reported earlier this week, security officials have privately told ministers that entering into the first phase of a deal would likely lead to its eventual completion to secure all hostages' return. Cabinet ministers appear increasingly willing to accept the heavy costs involved in such a deal, but they remain opposed to ending the war – which could once again become a major obstacle to reaching an agreement.

The positioning of IDF forces during any ceasefire also appears to have preliminary consensus. A senior cabinet minister revealed to Israel Hayom that while several issues under discussion could lead to a breakthrough, each also carries the potential to derail negotiations entirely. Both parties are mindful of Trump's upcoming January 20 inauguration, with Hamas concerned about deteriorating conditions and Israel anticipating stronger support for increasing pressure on Hamas – potentially allowing hostage recovery without current Biden administration constraints.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/24/worse-than-his-brother-mohammed-sinwar-frustrates-hostage-deal-mediators/	2024-12-24T06:26:06-08:00

Irresponsible': US ambassador Lew slams agency's Gaza famine rep...	A US government agency's dire warning about potential famine in northern Gaza has prompted an unusually strong rebuttal from US Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew, exposing a rare public disagreement over humanitarian assessments in the region. The Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) issued a report Monday night warning that 'If the food supply remains cut off from North Gaza Governorate, the combination of starvation and disease would most likely push non-trauma mortality above 2 people/10,000/day between January and March, meeting the third criterion for Famine (IPC Phase 5).' In response, Ambassador Lew issued a sharp critique: 'At a time when inaccurate information is causing confusion and accusations, it is irresponsible to issue a report like this.' FEWS NET, established by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and still partially funded by it, operates with support from NASA, the US Department of Agriculture, and other government agencies, as evidenced by USAID's logo on the FEWS NET website. This institutional backdrop makes Ambassador Lew's forceful rejection of the famine warning particularly significant. 'The report issued today on Gaza by FEWS NET relies on data that is outdated and inaccurate. We have worked closely with the Government of Israel and the UN to provide greater access to the North Governorate, and it is now apparent that the civilian population in that part of Gaza is in the range of 7,000-15,000, not 65,000-75,000 which is the basis of this report.' Trucks carrying humanitarian aid cross into the Gaza Strip from Erez crossing in southern Israel, Monday, Oct. 21, 2024. Photo credit: AP/Tsafrir Abayov AP To support his position, the senior American official referenced the Israeli Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) estimate of 5,000 to 9,000 Arab residents in northern Gaza, while noting that 'UNRWA estimates the population is between 10,000 and 15,000.' Addressing accusations about inadequate food delivery to northern Gaza, Lew emphasized, 'We work day and night with the UN and our Israeli partners to meet humanitarian needs — which are great — and relying on inaccurate data is irresponsible,' he concluded.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/24/irresponsible-us-ambassador-lew-slams-agencys-gaza-famine-report/	2024-12-23T23:45:00-08:00	
Trump, Biden aids demand Hamas free US hostages	In a powerful display of bipartisan cooperation, Robert O'Brien, former White House national security adviser under Trump, and Tom Nides, former US Ambassador to Israel under Biden, published a joint opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal Monday addressing the urgent plight of American hostages in Gaza since the Oct. 7 massacre. The authors revealed that from the twelve Americans initially taken hostage, four have been freed through negotiations, while Hersh Goldberg-Polin was murdered before Israeli forces could reach him. Seven Americans remain in Hamas captivity, including three confirmed deceased whose remains have not been returned. 'Hamas should interpret this bipartisan support as an unequivocal American unity,' O'Brien and Nides emphasized. 'Its supporters throughout the region must understand that returning our unlawfully detained citizens is a deeply rooted priority for the US government.' President-elect Donald Trump (AP/Alex Brandon) AP/Alex Brandon The officials highlighted the rare alignment between current and former presidents on this critical issue. 'President Biden and his team have been working tirelessly toward this goal,' they stated, while noting that 'President-elect Trump has issued a stark warning that the American Seven must be released before his return to office or face 'hell to pay.'' O'Brien and Nides outlined significant strategic shifts in the region, 'The strategic situation – for both the US and our close ally Israel – has markedly improved compared to a year or even a month ago.' They detailed how 'Hezbollah stands weakened, accepting a ceasefire under international supervision. Syria's regime has fallen, severely limiting Iran's ability to use it as an operational base and supply route for its proxies.' The authors specifically named each American hostage still in captivity: Edan Alexander, Itay Chen, Sagui Dekel-Chen, Gadi Haggai, Judi Weinstein Haggai, Omer Neutra and Keith Siegel. 'These families face another holiday season [Hanukkah] with an empty chair at their dinner table,' they wrote poignantly. 'Hamas and their supporters must receive this message with absolute clarity: Release the Americans in the first phase of the deal. Every single one,' they conclude firmly. 'This is the best offer Hamas will ever receive.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/24/in-rare-joint-plea-trump-biden-officials-demand-hamas-release-us-hostages/	2024-12-23T22:21:34-08:00

Pro-Iranian militias reportedly agree to stop firing on Israel	A senior figure in Iraq's pro-Iranian militia Al-Nujaba Movement (known as HHN) has confirmed that Iran's proxies in the country have reached an agreement with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' Al-Sudani to cease military operations targeting Israel in support of Gaza, the pro-Hezbollah Al-Akhbar reported on Monday. The agreement also includes maintaining silence regarding political developments in Syria, coming amid dialogue sparked by regional and international pressure to dismantle these factions and transfer their weapons to state control. Speaking to Al-Akhbar, the figure revealed that 'the factions have decided not to interfere in Syrian affairs and to monitor the situation from a distance while also awaiting the policy directions of US President-elect Donald Trump, particularly regarding the Middle East and Iran.' The source indicated that 'the Islamic Republic of Iran has granted us the freedom to decide on the Syrian scene and the control of terrorist groups such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS).' He criticized American and Israeli efforts promoting the dissolution of the Iraqi government's umbrella organization for militias, the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), describing these attempts as aimed at forcing the surrender of the resistance axis that has effectively challenged Israel over the past year. Iranian missiles on the background of a banknote of Iranian rials (Getty Images / Anton Petrus) Getty Images / Anton Petrus 'The armed factions have adhered to the Iraqi government's directives, especially after developments in Syria, where there are concerns about a scenario worse than the fall of Bashar Assad's regime, potentially leading to the resurgence of terrorism in Iraq,' the leader added. Prime Minister Al-Sudani recently dismissed suggestions about disbanding the PMF, stating in a televised interview that 'such claims are purely speculative and come from those who oppose the political process.' This came after an Iraqi official had disclosed receiving multiple international and regional requests to dismantle the PMF and transfer weapons to state control. Kazem Al-Fartousi, spokesperson for the Kata'ib Sayyid al-Shuhada Brigades, another pro-Iranian militia, told Al-Akhbar, 'Circumstances determine the positions of the factions. The principle of unity across fronts is not tied to a temporary alliance among resistance axis factions but is a matter of doctrine and conviction. Regardless of the losses, Iraqi factions have never abandoned this principle.' Al-Fartousi explained that 'the operations of the factions against Israel were linked to Hezbollah's operations in Lebanon. When a ceasefire was reached in Lebanon, the Iraqi factions also halted their operations. There are also partners in Iraq with reservations about these operations, and their perspectives must be considered.' He added, 'The situation is currently under review, and communication is ongoing among the resistance axis to coordinate positions and develop a unified vision.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/23/pro-iranian-militia-reportedly-vows-to-stop-firing-on-israel/	2024-12-23T01:20:45-08:00	
Bashar Assad going through divorce? Not so fast	In recent days, Turkish media published what appears to be false information regarding Syrian former president Bashar Assad's supposed impending divorce from his wife Asma. In response, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov issued an official statement vigorously denying 'claims circulated by Arab and foreign media outlets about Asma Assad filing for divorce.' It should be noted that the former Syrian leader's wife is battling leukemia. In the days before the Assad regime's collapse, she was staying in Moscow. This followed her husband's visit, who had to return to Damascus before fleeing when his army collapsed.

Did Trump propose new talks with Iran?	President-elect Donald Trump has extended an offer for high-level negotiations with Iran, including discussions about the nuclear file, through Omani diplomatic channels, Iran International reported Sunday, citing the Iraqi newspaper Baghdad Alyoum. Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei delivering a speech during a meeting with Iranian scientists and officials during an exhibition of the country's nuclear industry achievements in Tehran, Iran on June 11, 2023 EPA According to a source close to Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian's administration, quoted by Baghdad Alyoum, the US message conveyed a willingness to engage in direct talks and potentially forge a new nuclear agreement that would differ from the 2015 deal that Trump abandoned in 2018. The source, speaking to Baghdad Alyoum, indicated that the US administration has set an informal timeline of 'a few months' for Tehran to respond to the proposal for negotiations, which would encompass various issues, with the nuclear file taking precedence. The diplomatic overture comes as Iranian diplomat Seyyed Hossein Mousavian published an analysis in an Iranianian outlet suggesting that direct, high-level talks between the two nations could be imminent. In his article, Mousavian cautioned that while negotiations might lead to an agreement, there were no guarantees the US would maintain its commitments even if talks proved successful.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/23/did-trump-propose-new-talks-with-iran/	2024-12-22T20:38:20-08:00	
Hamas concedes military capabilities lost, shifts to other tactic...	Sources within Hamas admitted Sunday that Israel Defense Forces operations have successfully neutralized most of their military capabilities in Gaza, forcing the terrorist organization's fighters to adopt alternative tactics. Speaking to the Saudi newspaper A-Sharq Al-Awsat, Hamas sources revealed that fighters on the ground are now making decisions independently without receiving direct orders from senior command. While they still attempt to update higher-ranking officials about their plans, these communications can take hours or even days to reach what remains of Hamas's leadership in Gaza. Among the surviving senior Hamas commanders in Gaza are Mohammed Sinwar, brother of Yahya Sinwar, who has reportedly taken command of the military wing; Izz ad-Din al-Haddad, responsible for terrorists in northern Gaza; Mohammed Shabana, who served as commander of the now-disbanded Rafah Brigade; and Tawfiq Abu Naim, head of Hamas internal security apparatus. div]:bg-bg-300 [&_.ignore-pre-bg>div]:bg-transparent [&_pre]:-mr-4 md:[&_pre]:-mr-9' style='box-sizing: border-box; border-image: initial; --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: hsl(var(--accent-secondary-100)/1); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 #0000; outline-color: hsl(var(--accent-main-100)); position: relative; padding-right: 2.25rem; line-height: 1.65rem; font-family: var(--font-claude-message); border: 0px solid hsl(var(--border-100));'> _*]:min-w-0' style='box-sizing: border-box; border-image: initial; --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: hsl(var(--accent-secondary-100)/1); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 #0000; outline-color: hsl(var(--accent-main-100)); display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(1, minmax(0px, 1fr)); gap: 0.625rem; border: 0px solid hsl(var(--border-100));'> The IDF's Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee warned over the weekend that Hamas is spreading falsehoods to maintain its fighters' morale.

A large portion of the weaponry was manufactured before the war. Nevertheless, after 15 months of fighting, the terrorists have lost most of their capabilities. This process, the sources said, has occurred alongside the elimination of key Hamas figures involved in weapons production and engineering. In recent days, Hamas released footage of a drone launch toward the western Negev that was intercepted. According to Hamas, the drone was launched from eastern Khan Younis. Other footage this month showed cells of four to five terrorists planting explosive devices in shafts. These videos appear intended to signal the restoration of capabilities.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/22/hamas-most-of-our-capabilities-in-gaza-have-been-neutralized/	2024-12-22T02:05:01-08:00	
Hezbollah terrorist leader's ring gets surprise bid	Iranian media outlets reported a ring belonging to Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah was sold at a public auction for the equivalent of $16,000. It appears to be one of the rings worn by the head of the terrorist organization, who was killed in an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) strike in September. The ring worn by Nasrallah was sold for a whopping $16,000 (Arab social media) The ring was sold for $16,000, with the proceeds to be transferred to the Lebanese people. The Iranian news agency IRNA reported in October that Iran's Ofogh TV network intended to sell Nasrallah's ring at a public auction, with the revenues meant to 'go to the Lebanese people.' Mojtaba Rahmandoost, a member of Iran's Shura Council, said he received the ring as a gift from Nasrallah in February 2014 and would put it up for public auction. Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah gives a televised address at a memorial ceremony to mark one week since the killing of Wissam Tawil, a commander of Hezbollah's elite Radwan forces on January 14, 2024 Reuters / Aziz Taher Wearing rings is an ancient custom in Shiite Islam. The ring is usually worn on the right hand. Among the pro-Iran axis, the rings worn by Qassem Soleimani, slain commander of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi are particularly well-known. Soleimani was killed in January 2020. The ring was used to identify his body after the US strike. According to various reports, Raisi's body was also identified by the ring on his hand after his helicopter crashed. Similar rings are worn by Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and senior members of pro-Iranian militias in Iraq. The ring apparently symbolizes, among other things, the connection between members of the axis. A Lebanese cleric told the BBC's Arabic network that the ring is linked to several Islamic and Arab traditions. However, he notes that a person must not be attached to a stone out of a belief that it can harm or benefit them.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/22/hezbollah-terrorist-leaders-ring-gets-surprise-bid/	2024-12-22T01:19:51-08:00	
Mass grave in Syria may contain remains of 100K	According to the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a newly discovered mass grave outside Damascus potentially contains the remains of at least 100,000 people allegedly killed under the regime of former President Bashar Assad. The organization's leader, Mouaz Moustafa, told Reuters in a phone interview from Damascus that the site in al-Qutayfah, located approximately 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of the Syrian capital, is one of five mass graves he has identified through his investigations. Reuters reports that Moustafa believes the death toll at this single location could be significantly higher, describing the 100,000 figure as 'a very, very extremely almost unfairly conservative estimate.' According to his findings, the victims include not only Syrian citizens but also Americans, British nationals, and other foreigners. The discovery comes in the wake of Assad's recent ousting by rebel forces, as reported by The Associated Press. Assad, who ruled Syria for 24 years following his father's three-decade reign, has fled to Moscow where he has been granted asylum by his long-time Russian allies. An opposition fighter steps on a broken bust of the late Syrian President Hafez Assad in Damascus, Syria, Sunday Dec. 8, 2024 (AP/Hussein Malla) AP/Hussein Malla According to The Associated Press, the majority of Assad's former territory is now under the control of Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), led by former al-Qaida commander Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani. The group, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, has begun establishing a new government and initiating diplomatic relations with foreign states. The Associated Press notes that Syria has been largely inaccessible to journalists since the outbreak of civil war in 2011 due to government restrictions and ongoing violence. The recent change in leadership has allowed journalists to return, leading to new revelations about life under the Assad regime. Moustafa expressed urgent concerns about the security of the grave sites, emphasizing the importance of preserving evidence for future investigations. Human rights organizations estimate that Assad's security forces may have killed 150,000 people since 2011. Syria's UN Ambassador Koussay Aldahhak, who assumed his role while Assad was still in power, has not responded to requests for comment. In a statement released via Telegram, Assad said: 'I have carried an unwavering conviction in their will and ability to protect the state, defend its institutions, and uphold their choices to the very last moment.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/19/mass-grave-in-syria-may-contain-remains-of-100000-victims-including-americans/	2024-12-18T21:11:11-08:00	
Al-Julani rules out Afghan model for Syria	Syria's new de facto leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, declared in an exclusive BBC interview that his war-torn nation no longer poses a threat to neighboring countries or Western nations, marking a significant shift in tone from the country's new leadership. In the interview conducted in Damascus, al-Sharaa emphasized the need to lift international sanctions, arguing that the measures were designed to target the previous regime. 'The victim and the oppressor should not be treated in the same way,' he said. Al-Sharaa, also known as Abu Mohammad al-Julani, led the recent offensive that overthrew Bashar Assad's government less than two weeks ago and heads the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the dominant force in the rebel alliance. He now seeks to distance his organization from its designation as a terrorist group by the UN, US, EU, and UK. Al-Sharaa directly addressed concerns about his group's past connections to al-Qaeda, which it separated from in 2016. He insisted that HTS does not target civilians and portrayed his organization as a victim of the Assad regime's actions. Al-Sharaa rejected comparisons between his vision for Syria and Afghanistan's governance model, emphasizing Syria's distinct cultural traditions. He pointed to education initiatives in rebel-held territories, stating, 'The percentage of women in universities is more than 60%' in Idlib province, which has been under rebel control since 2011.

The interview showed al-Sharaa in civilian clothes, appearing relaxed as he attempted to reassure those skeptical about his group's break from its extremist past. Many Syrians remain unconvinced, and the actions of Syria's new rulers in the next few months will indicate the kind of country they want Syria to be – and the way they want to rule it.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/19/al-julani-gives-first-interview-to-western-media/	2024-12-18T20:30:17-08:00	
Saudis celebrate Operation White City	In the aftermath of Operation White City, Israel's strategic strike on Houthi targets in Yemen, reactions across the Arab world have revealed deep regional divisions. While Saudi commentators appeared to welcome the action, Hamas rushed to express solidarity with the Houthis, who vowed continued attacks on Israeli targets. Video: The Israeli strike in Yemen on Dec. 19, 2024 Rassan Charbel, editor at a leading Saudi newspaper, penned a pointed commentary this morning: 'Netanyahu, at his most imperious, gazes across the region from Mount Hermon before dispatching his aircraft to strike Houthi positions in Yemen. What must Tehran be thinking as it witnesses Israeli strikes on Sanaa this morning? Do these fresh Israeli strikes on Yemen represent one of the final communications to Iran?' On social media platform X, IDF Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee crafted an acrostic spelling out 'Sanaa,' cleverly mimicking and mocking the Houthi spokespersons' practice of writing targeted Israeli locations in the same style. ص ن ع ا ء — افيخاي ادرعي (@AvichayAdraee) December 19, 2024 When senior Houthi official Mohammed Ali al-Houthi decried the Israeli strike as a 'war crime,' Adraee responded with sharp irony: 'He attacked me and cried. He preceded me and complained.' Hamas issued a strong condemnation of Israel's attack on Houthi positions in Yemen. 'We stand in complete solidarity with Yemen and our brothers in the Ansarallah movement as they face Zionist, American, and British aggression,' the organization declared in an official statement. Within Yemen, Houthi activist Mohammed bin Radwan asserted that Saudi commentators were celebrating what he termed 'the Israeli-Saudi strike on the capital, Sanaa.' Saudi activist Abdul Rahman al-Otaibi countered with derision: 'Where is Israel? How could it be attacking Sanaa? You claimed victory over the US and Israel just a year ago, and now you position yourselves as victims.'

He specified these as 'Palestine-2' hypersonic missiles, adding that the launches were synchronized with 'the Israeli strike on civilian facilities in Sanaa and Hodeidah province, including power stations.' The spokesperson issued a warning that they would 'respond to this brutal aggression while maintaining support for Gaza and targeting all hostile positions with appropriate weaponry.' He emphasized that the Israeli strike would not prevent them from fulfilling their obligation to respond to the ongoing conflict in Gaza.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/19/saudis-celebrate-operation-white-city/	2024-12-18T18:30:38-08:00	
US pressures Iraq to dismantle pro-Iranian militias	The London-based newspaper Al-Arab reported on Wednesday that the US seeks to capitalize on Hezbollah's defeat in Lebanon and the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria. According to the report, American officials are pressuring the Iraqi government to move forward with dismantling pro-Iranian militias. Much of this pressure is directed at Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' Al-Sudani. Iraqi sources indicated that Al-Sudani finds himself in a difficult position following a recent meeting with a delegation led by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Blinken reportedly called on him to take swift and decisive action against these militias. The primary demand, according to these sources, is for the Iraqi government to pass a resolution mandating the immediate disbandment of the militias and to target any group refusing to surrender its weapons to the state. On this issue, the US has emphasized zero tolerance for flexibility. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' Al-Sudani. Photo: Reuters Blinken's secret visit to Baghdad last Friday, during which he urged Iraq to adopt hardline measures against pro-Iranian militias, reportedly came just days after the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria. This push to dismantle the militias is part of a broader effort to weaken Iran's strategy, which relies heavily on terrorist organizations across different regions to consolidate its influence. However, Al-Arab clarified that dismantling these militias would require a fatwa from Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's most senior Shiite cleric. Such a fatwa seems unlikely, given recent foreign engagements with al-Sistani, including meetings with UN representatives. The report noted that UN representative Mohammed Al-Hassan held discussions with al-Sistani about potential steps to distance Iraq from conflicts and crises that could impact the country. Al-Hassan emphasized the precarious state of the region and expressed hope that Iraq's leadership could navigate the nation away from the entanglements of the broader regional conflict. Antony Blinken. Photo: EPA Iraqi sources revealed that some militias were informed of the US position and have begun preparing statements signaling their intent to distance themselves from Iran. These declarations reportedly underscore their commitment to Iraq's official policy of non-intervention in Syria. Nonetheless, fully dismantling these militias or relinquishing their weaponry remains a challenging prospect, even if it could shield them from potential strikes by Israel or the US. It's worth noting that while US pressure has intensified, the pro-Iranian militias in Iraq have refrained from launching drones toward Israel in recent weeks.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/18/us-pressures-iraq-to-dismantle-pro-iranian-militias/	2024-12-18T02:00:04-08:00	
Call between Israeli, Australian ministers takes ugly turn	Amid escalating antisemitism in Australia, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar and Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong engaged in a heated phone call on Tuesday. The discussion, initially aimed at improving bilateral relations, quickly escalated into a direct clash of viewpoints on Gaza. Gideon Sa'ar (Ancho Gosh / JINI) Ancho Gosh / JINI Wong, known for her alignment with anti-Israel voices within the ruling Australian Labor Party, accused Israel of failing to provide sufficient humanitarian aid for Gaza's Palestinian residents. Sa'ar refuted her claims, emphasizing that Israel had endured a large-scale assault on October 7 not just by Hamas but also by five additional entities, some of which do not even share borders with the country. 'Australia chose to distance itself from Israel during the most challenging year in its modern history,' Sa'ar said, condemning Australia's weakened international support for Israel. He further criticized Wong's recent inclusion of Israel alongside Russia and China as part of the same ilk. 'Israel is a Western democracy with robust rule of law, an independent judiciary, and adherence to international standards,' he stated. Sa'ar also protested the recent incident in which former Israeli minister Ayelet Shaked was refused entry into Australia, calling it a diplomatic affront. 'How would Australians respond if we treated one of their former ministers this way?' he asked. Shaked's invitation to a conference hosted by Australia Israel & Jewish Affairs Council (AIJAC) was seen as an effort to strengthen ties between the two nations, making the rejection unprecedented for a figure of her political standing. Reports suggest the visa denial stemmed from her opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state. Addressing the broader issue of antisemitism, Sa'ar expressed concern over the recent arson attack on Melbourne's historic Adass Israel Synagogue, a symbol of resilience for the city's Jewish community. 'Israel expects decisive action from Australia,' he declared. Benjamin Klein, a synagogue board member, described the attack as deeply shocking. 'Our community has been on high alert with security patrols and cameras, but seeing this level of destruction is heart-wrenching,' he said.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/18/call-between-israeli-australia-ministers-takes-ugly-turn/	2024-12-17T15:23:26-08:00	
Are Israel, Hamas near 'almost final' stage of talks?	Palestinian sources told the Saudi news channel Asharq on Tuesday that current discussions regarding a ceasefire and hostage deal have reached an advanced, 'almost final' stage, particularly those taking place in Qatar. According to the report, Qatari and Egyptian mediators are working with Israeli and Hamas technical teams to finalize details of the hostage deal and ceasefire through agreed-upon implementation mechanisms that will be under international supervision. Protesters demand a deal to secure the release of Hamas-held hostages AFP / Jack Guez The sources said the agreement between the parties would be executed in three phases. The first phase would be a 'humanitarian stage' including additional supply deliveries to the Gaza Strip and the release of all Israeli female hostages, including female soldiers, as well as civilian hostages. Furthermore, according to the report, the agreement would conclude in its final stage with a permanent ceasefire and complete Israel Defense Forces withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, including the Philadelphi Route and Netzarim Route. Asharq noted that the IDF would maintain six points in Gaza during the first two phases. Gaza's rebuilding efforts would begin afterward. According to the report, the first two phases would include the release of hostages in exchange for hundreds of prisoners. The ceasefire would likely be gradual, spread across three phases. It was also noted that the first phase would last six weeks. During this phase, it was reported that IDF forces would withdraw from part of the Philadelphi Route to the eastern side of the Rafah crossing. A partial withdrawal from the Netzarim Route and Gaza population centers was also reported. Additionally, it was reported that under the agreement, Gaza residents would be allowed to return to Gaza City and northern Gaza Strip under a military supervision mechanism intended to ensure Hamas operatives do not enter the area. Reports emerged during the day that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was heading to Cairo for talks about the developing deal, though his office denied these reports. Meanwhile, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas was invited for talks in Cairo to discuss developments in the contacts and new arrangements taking shape in the region.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/17/progress-reported-in-gaza-hostage-deal-talks-as-sides-near-agreement/	2024-12-17T07:04:24-08:00

The negotiations have gained significant momentum, with both sides showing flexibility on key sticking points. Shortly after the report came out, Hamas said an agreement was possible if Israel stopped 'setting new conditions.'

However, according to Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz, Hamas has demonstrated a willingness to compromise on these matters. 'The Philadelphi and Netzarim routes are no longer an obstacle; Hamas has shown flexibility on these matters,' Katz said during a Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee session. Israel has also reportedly softened its stance on certain conditions as negotiators work to establish an inspection mechanism for civilians moving northward – a system that Hamas had previously rejected. The Israeli government official stated that the talks have focused on bridging gaps to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. In a related development, Reuters reported that an Israeli delegation has traveled to Doha to continue the dialogue, signaling the seriousness of both parties to reach a resolution.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/17/israel-hamas-poised-to-conclude-deal-as-pm-reportedly-in-cairo/	2024-12-17T06:20:26-08:00	
Hamas capitulates hostage stance amid growing pressure	Hamas has demonstrated increased flexibility in peace negotiations, offering key concessions in a new proposal for a 60-day pause in fighting and hostage exchanges, The Washington Post reported Sunday. The militant group has retreated from previous demands for a complete halt to the war and full withdrawal of Israeli forces, according to a Hamas official who spoke to The Washington Post on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Progress has also been made regarding the number of hostages Israel demands in the first phase. The number includes, as mediated, adults over 50, those who are ill, and all who qualify as 'humanitarian cases' in exchange for six weeks of ceasefire. In a sign of diplomatic movement, Hamas recently provided Israel with names of living hostages through Egyptian intermediaries, according to a former Egyptian official who spoke to The Washington Post anonymously due to the sensitive nature of the negotiations. On Monday, Defense Minister Israel Katz said, 'There will be overwhelming support for the deal that's on the table, we're closer than we've ever been.' Supporters gather for a demonstration calling upon the US to intervene for the release of the hostages in Gaza, outside the US Embassy branch office in Tel Aviv on December 12, 2024 (Photo: Jack Guez / AFP) AFP The shift comes as Hamas faces growing pressure from Palestinians in Gaza, who are increasingly critical of the group as they struggle with displacement, hunger, and continued Israeli military operations after more than 14 months of conflict. A recent proposal includes provisions for exchanging Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, though Hamas maintains its insistence that displaced Palestinians be allowed to return to northern Gaza, the official told The Washington Post. The organization's military capabilities have been significantly reduced, according to Tahani Mustafa, senior Palestine analyst at the International Crisis Group, though she noted Hamas 'has shown that it has the capacity to maintain a long-term insurgency.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected any postwar role for Hamas in Gaza and dismissed the possibility of the Palestinian Authority's return to the territory. Meanwhile, some members of his far-right coalition are advocating for annexation and resettlement of the enclave. Public support for Hamas in Gaza has declined sharply, with satisfaction in the group's performance dropping to 39% in September from 64% in June, according to polling by the Ramallah-based Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research. Netanyahu said Thursday that Israeli forces had killed 'close to 20,000' Hamas fighters. The IDF conducted operations that resulted in the deaths of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran in July and military leader Yahya Sinwar in southern Gaza in October. Some analysts suggest Hamas is attempting to balance acknowledgment of public discontent while maintaining its position as the face of resistance against Israel. 'Hamas realizes that it will be out of the governance picture for a long time,' but will remain entrenched as 'an idea, an ideology, an active political party in Palestinian mainstream politics,' said Tamer Qarmout, a Gazan professor of public policy at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/17/hamas-capitulates-hostage-stance-amid-growing-pressure/	2024-12-17T04:36:58-08:00	
Defense Minister: Israel will control Gaza like Judea and Samaria	Defense Minister Israel Katz declared on Wednesday that Israel will maintain security control over Gaza following Hamas's defeat, marking a clear stance on the territory's future governance.

Houthi stronghold reportedly struck again	According to initial reports, another attack took place in Hodeidah, Yemen, just months after Israel attacked the strategic oil storage facility in the city's port in response to Iranian-backed Houthi aggression. It was unclear whether this was an Israeli strike or an American act as part of the US-led operation against the Shiite militia. US and UK forces struck Yemen's Houthis on Monday, January 22, 2024 (Free usage under Section 27a of Israel's Intellectual Property Law) Free usage under Section 27a of Israel's Intellectual Property Law Israeli officials have recently warned that the situation cannot continue and were preparing for a significant strike against Houthi targets in Yemen. On Monday, Israel intercepted a missile fired by the Houthis, just days after they tried to send several unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) launched toward Israel. One UAV was intercepted near Eilat, another was downed using soft defenses, and a third disappeared from radar and has yet to be located. Israel conducted airstrikes against Houthi military positions in Yemen's Hodeidah in late September following missile launches by the Iran-backed group targeting Israel. The operation resulted in 4 deaths and 29 injuries, according to Houthi health officials, while locals reported widespread power disruptions across the port city. Several months earlier, Israel attacked the port following a drone attack on Tel Aviv that killed 1.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/17/houthi-port-reportedly-struck-again/	2024-12-16T22:43:38-08:00	
Hamas agrees to terms for first-phase hostage release	Talks toward a hostage release deal have gained significant traction, according to a senior Israeli government official Monday evening. Recent negotiations have focused on bridging gaps, particularly regarding the deployment of Israeli forces along the Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors during a ceasefire. Reuters reported that an Israeli delegation has traveled to Doha to continue the dialogue. 'The Philadelphi and Netzarim routes are no longer an obstacle; Hamas has shown flexibility on these matters,' Defense Minister Israel Katz said during a Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee session. Reports suggest that Israel has also softened its stance on certain conditions.

The group is expected to include adults over 50, those with illnesses, and individuals classified as 'humanitarian cases,' in exchange for a six-week ceasefire. Earlier in the day, president-elect Donald Trump issued a renewed warning to Hamas, urging the group to release the hostages before his inauguration. Trump's special envoy for hostage affairs, Adam Boehler, discreetly conducted meetings in Israel with top officials, including the defense minister, foreign minister, and the Knesset speaker. Boehler's request for confidentiality kept these discussions largely out of the public eye, but observers note growing US involvement in the region. During the committee meeting, Katz emphasized his confidence that the deal would secure overwhelming approval within both the government and the cabinet. 'I have instructed the security establishment to place the release of hostages at the forefront of our priorities in the ongoing conflict. 'This is the policy I advocate for, and I am actively working to advance it. With Hamas demonstrating a newfound willingness to compromise, we are hopeful that practical steps can be taken soon. As I have said before, this is a moral obligation and the most important mission before us,' Katz said.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/17/hamas-agrees-to-terms-for-first-phase-hostage-release/	2024-12-16T20:30:45-08:00

We are proud to have brought her to Israel twice already in the past year to witness firsthand the aftermath of that horrible day, show solidarity with the victims of the attack, and facilitate her advocacy for the hostages, and we believe this video is an important initiative in the effort to return them to their families.' The video has gone viral since its release Monday on Tucker's social media channels, drawing millions of viewers to the ongoing plight of the Israeli hostages. This marks Tucker's second collaboration with CAM on a dance video. In June, she released 'We Can Dance Again,' dedicated to the memory of the 364 young men and women murdered at the Nova music festival on Oct. 7, 2023. That video received more than 10 million views across various social media platforms.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/17/pro-israel-influencer-montana-tucker-releases-powerful-tribute-to-gaza-hostages/	2024-12-16T20:30:08-08:00	
WSJ: US warns of imminent Turkish offensive in Syria	Senior US officials are warning that Turkey appears to be preparing for a large-scale military offensive into Kurdish-held territory in Syria, citing an alarming buildup of forces along the border, The Wall Street Journal reported. US officials told The Wall Street Journal that Turkish military commandos, artillery units, and allied militia fighters have concentrated in significant numbers near the Kurdish-majority city of Kobani in northern Syria, in moves reminiscent of Turkey's 2019 invasion of the northeastern part of the country. 'We are focused on it and pressing for restraint,' a US official told The Wall Street Journal, warning that a cross-border operation could be imminent. The buildup has prompted intense concern in Washington, coming just after Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime fell to rebel groups led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham in early December. US officials view the power vacuum as potentially destabilizing for the entire region. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan addresses provincial leaders of ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) in Ankara (EPA/STR) EPA/STR US Secretary of State Antony Blinken made an urgent visit to Turkey last week to discuss Syria's future with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and seek assurances that Ankara would limit operations against Kurdish fighters. However, US-brokered ceasefire talks between the Syrian Kurds and Turkish-backed rebels in Kobani collapsed Monday without agreement, according to a Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) spokesman, who reported 'significant military buildups' east and west of the city. The developments threaten to undermine joint US-Kurdish operations against Islamic State remnants in northeast Syria. The SDF has been a critical US ally in the fight against Islamic State but is considered by Ankara to be an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party. Ilham Ahmed, an official in the Syrian Kurds' civilian administration, appealed directly to President-elect Donald Trump in a letter viewed by The Wall Street Journal, warning that Turkey aims to 'establish de facto control over our land before you take office, forcing you to engage with them as rulers of our territory.' 'If Turkey proceeds with its invasion, the consequences will be catastrophic,' Ahmed wrote to Trump. The Turkish embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment from The Wall Street Journal. Speaking at his Florida residence Monday, Trump suggested Turkey orchestrated Hayat Tahrir al-Sham's takeover of Syria, saying, 'Turkey did an unfriendly takeover without a lot of lives being lost.' Ahmed warned Trump that a Turkish invasion would displace more than 200,000 Kurdish civilians in Kobani alone, along with many Christian communities. During his first term, Trump partially withdrew US troops from northeast Syria, leading to a major Turkish offensive that resulted in hundreds of thousands of Syrian casualties and displaced persons. The Trump administration later helped broker a ceasefire that required Kurdish forces to cede miles of border territory to Turkish control. Though Trump doesn't take office until Jan. 20, Ahmed urged the president-elect to use his 'unique approach to diplomacy' to convince Erdogan to halt any planned operation, referencing a previous meeting where Trump promised 'the United States wouldn't abandon the Kurds.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/17/us-warns-of-imminent-turkish-offensive-in-syria/	2024-12-16T20:02:09-08:00	
My child is alive': Tensions boil at Knesset as hostage mother p...	In an emotionally charged Knesset committee hearing Monday, the mother of an Israeli hostage held by Hamas confronted Minister Zeev Elkin and threatened to 'take the law into my own hands' if her son was not brought back, while families of those killed in the October 7 attacks pleaded for greater support and recognition. This comes just hours after Israeli media reported that there was progress made in the talks with Hamas over a possible hostage deal even before Hanukkah. Video: Tensions boil at the Knesset over hostages / Credit: Knesset Press Office The clashes on Monday happened during the special committee session on strengthening and developing the Negev and Galilee when Einav Zangauker, mother of Hamas-held hostage Matan Zangauker, confronted Elkin. Zangauker criticized the government's handling of the ongoing talks regarding a deal with Hamas, some 14 months after the terrorist group waged its atrocities and took more than 240 Israelis hostages and killed more than 1200. 'Minister Elkin, you're talking about the price? What price did you pay to enter the government? For which portfolios?' she demanded. 'My Matan shouldn't have to pay with his life, or you can join the government for a few portfolios. The only price I'm willing for you to pay for abandoning Matan is your resignation.' 'Stop deceiving us,' she continued, emphasizing: 'We can prevent soldiers' deaths through a ceasefire, and we can prevent hostages' deaths in captivity. The price is a comprehensive deal with a beginning, middle, and end. All are humanitarian cases, and all are at risk of death.' Matan Zangauker was taken hostage on Oct. 7, 2023 Zangauker accused the government of withholding information: 'Tell the truth to families who have no intelligence about their loved ones, that even the military doesn't know where their loved ones' bodies are. Stop deceiving us. You're busy with politics while they're being murdered in captivity, and their bodies are disappearing.' She concluded with a threat: 'If my child returns in a body bag – I won't put you on trial; I'll take the law into my own hands. My child is alive, and there are a few others like him. Tell the public the truth. Stop your cynical manipulation.' Addressing the minister personally, she added: 'Take off your kippah – what kind of Jew are you? The Creator sees people's true intentions. You and your government partners have lost your way and your values. The price should be a comprehensive deal in exchange for ending the war.'

'Look what they did to my child; they riddled his entire body with bullets. And his girlfriend lying next to him,' she said tearfully. 'Why is no one looking at us? We're not living. No one approaches us, and there's no support. Don't abandon us; we're not second-class citizens.' In an emotional appeal to Acting Committee Chairman MK Yitzhak Kroizer, she continued: 'Look at his neck, his hand, his girlfriend lying on the ground. Look what I received; how can anyone live like this? The families of the murdered are never mentioned.' The mother described her family's difficult situation since October 7, saying, 'Since October 7, we haven't been working, moving from place to place. Our once-united family has been destroyed. I want this in the media. I want the picture of my son and his partner to be in front of you.'After feeling unwell during the session, Kroizer accompanied her outside, promising, 'We are here for you.' They later returned to continue the discussion.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/16/my-child-is-alive-tensions-boil-at-knesset-as-hostage-mother-pleads/	2024-12-16T01:32:17-08:00	
Israeli ambassador to Ireland speaks out after embassy closure	Fourteen months after taking office and several months after leaving Ireland due to anti-Israel measures in the international arena, Dana Erlich, Israel's ambassador to Ireland, speaks about her difficult period as an ambassador in Europe's most anti-Israel country and the decision to close the Israeli embassy in Ireland. 'It's a very difficult feeling. The decision to close the embassy is brave and correct, but it's a complex situation for the staff, the embassy, the Israeli and Jewish community, and on a personal level. As someone who has been on the front lines every day since the tensions began, it's not easy,' the former ambassador said. 'True, Ireland has been a diplomatically challenging country for many years, even before Oct. 7, 2023, but it's still hard to close an embassy. It's a historic event. It's also difficult to part with the people who accompanied us and were partners in the challenging journey we've been through in the last 14 months.' This is Dana Erlich's first role as an ambassador. Previously, she held numerous positions in the Foreign Ministry, including roles in Costa Rica and Los Angeles, political advisor in London, and headquarters positions such as coordination manager in the Foreign Ministry Director General's office and director of the cadet course. 'When I started my mission in Ireland, I met with Irish officials who claimed they weren't anti-Israel, and I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and see where the relations would progress,' Erlich said. Just a month after taking office, she quickly realized that the Irish conduct was anti-Israel. 'In the past year, we've seen how the Irish have crossed every boundary of extremism, to the point of obsession against us. When you ask the International Court of Justice to change the definition of 'genocide' to fit what they want us to be guilty of, which is what the Irish did, then it's already an obsession.' Pro-Palestinian activists from the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign, supported by members of left-wing parties including People Before Profit and the Socialist Party and students, participate in the National March for Palestine from the Garden of Remembrance to Connell Street and Leinster House, on May 18, 2024, in Dublin, Ireland. Photo credit: Artur Widak/NurPhoto via AFP NurPhoto via AFP Receiving thank-you notes from Hamas and promoting BDS legislation 'When they recognize a Palestinian state and receive thank-you notes from Hamas, we understand where they stand in terms of their opinions. When they try to promote BDS legislation that will harm Irish citizens and the Irish economy, these are not steps that contribute to coexistence. These aren't even pro-Palestinian steps; they're anti-Israel steps.' Since she began serving as ambassador in early September 2023, Erlich encountered a harsh reality bordering on impossible, with hostility coming from the media, the political establishment, and ordinary citizens. 'The extreme discourse has taken over Irish public opinion. I think they are in an echo chamber that only fuels each other. The media, civil society, and politicians are competing to see who can be more extreme against Israel. 'I don't think the entire Irish nation is antisemitic or that everyone is against Israel, but given the discourse that has developed, people who think Israel is okay are afraid to express their opinion, and a completely one-sided discourse has been created, including bullying towards anyone who expresses a balanced position, let alone pro-Israel positions. A total distortion has been created here. A one-dimensional narrative against Israel 'We keep saying that there's a one-sided bias and double standard when it comes to Israel, and it's so ingrained in the Irish system that they can't even see it. The delegitimization of any cooperation with Israel, even without government sponsorship, has become illegitimate, and this is what we don't see in any other country. 'I also look at Ireland and don't see that a change in the political map will change their attitude towards us. In the media, there's no other story but a one-dimensional narrative against Israel. In the public sphere, there are no factors presenting a more balanced position. It's one similar voice that is ultimately anti-Israel.' Q: Why is it important to maintain relations with Ireland? 'It's important to emphasize that closing the embassy is not severing relations, but transitioning to a different format. We don't have embassies in every country we have relations with. The decision is to channel and transfer resources to a place that is interested in cooperating with us. We maintain channels of dialogue with many countries where we don't have embassies. Regarding relations with Ireland, there's a Jewish and Israeli community there, and it's important for us to ensure their presence and security.

Photo credit: REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne REUTERS 'There are many large international companies in Ireland, and we have shared trade relations between Israel, Ireland, and the US, as well as relationships with the business sector and the private sector, and these relationships will continue. Israel has relationships with other countries as well, even those that are relatively hostile to Israel's policies.' Delegitimization campaign In addition to the delegitimization campaign against Israel, there was also a delegitimization campaign directed specifically against Ambassador Erlich, including death threats, distribution of posters with her picture, sending threatening letters to the embassy, and countless calls against her, including on social media. 'It's difficult to be at the center of an incitement campaign focused on the country you love and on you personally. It's hard to see the price all the embassy staff members paid because they worked at the Israeli embassy. It was a difficult year for all of us, but what kept me going was the pride I have in having a voice and role during one of the country's most difficult periods. 'The incitement campaign stems from the fact that our messages received resonance and presence in Ireland. I also felt a personal threat at times; my freedom of movement was restricted due to the many threats and the specific situation there. But I think it's not easy for anyone in the Foreign Ministry during this period; it's not easy for any ambassador to be in this situation. What we showed in the last 14 months is that we're not afraid and are at the forefront of facing every diplomatic challenge. At the same time, part of this duty is also knowing how to reassess resources and benefits. Q: To what extent did you experience antisemitism there? 'If we define delegitimization of Israel as antisemitism, then it's impossible to separate the two. Antisemitism is present.' Q: People from the Israeli community in Ireland expressed great appreciation for your activities in Ireland, and at the same time, expressed concern about the future due to the closure of the embassy. What is your message to them? 'I hear their concerns and understand them. We will continue to help them in every possible way. It should be emphasized that their concerns stem from the fact that the Irish government does not provide security for the Jewish and Israeli communities. In the past year, the Israeli community in Ireland has been a close, important, and valued partner. They are amazing people who pay high personal prices in their workplaces because of their support for Israel and because they are Israelis or Jews. I appreciate them, and for me, they are one of the things that made it easier for me, knowing that we are on the front lines but not alone, and they also need to know that they are not alone, and we will continue to help them as much as we can.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/16/israeli-ambassador-to-ireland-speaks-out-after-embassy-closure/	2024-12-15T23:00:53-08:00	
Hostage deal could be reached by Hanukkah, Israeli official says	An Israeli official, previously skeptical about negotiations, confirmed this week that progress has been made in talks aimed at securing the release of Israeli hostages held by the Hamas terror organization in the Gaza Strip. Additionally, a source familiar with the negotiations told Israel Hayom that talks to formulate a hostage release deal are expected to be completed by Hanukkah at month's end, with the implementation spread over an extended period. The main point of contention between Israel and Hamas remains the number of hostages to be released during the deal. A source privy to the details indicated that Israel is still awaiting Hamas' responses regarding both the framework of the deal and the organization's ability to secure the release of hostages it commits to as part of the agreement. Rally for the release of hostages held in Gaza, Nov. 23, 2024, Tel Aviv (Gideon Markowicz) Gideon Markowicz According to the source, Israel will evaluate its next steps after Hamas presents a list of hostages it can release. 'The ball is in their court,' the source said. Despite the gaps between the parties, the message received from mediators has sparked more cautious optimism compared to the past. In the same optimistic tone, Saudi news channel Al Arabiya quoted a senior Hamas official saying there has been 'unprecedented progress in negotiations for a Gaza ceasefire.' As of Dec. 16, 100 Israeli hostages remain in Gaza, having been kidnapped by Hamas on Oct. 7. Thirty-six of the hostages have been declared dead.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/16/hostage-deal-could-be-reached-by-hanukkah-israeli-official-says/	2024-12-15T22:13:15-08:00	
WATCH: Israeli pilots' touching tribute to hostages	Recent weather conditions in Israel have enabled a unique phenomenon in the skies – impressive condensation trails that have captivated viewers nationwide. One of the most remarkable instances captured Monday was the ribbon symbol representing the hostages, created by Israeli Air Force pilots and aircraft, which was documented by numerous Israelis. Video: IAF pilots blanket nation's skies with hostage symbols in stunning tribute The striking display results from an interesting atmospheric phenomenon that occurs when hot water vapor expelled from aircraft engines meets cold air at high altitudes. The 'trail' visible in the sky forms when the hot engine emissions encounter cold, humid air at high altitudes, condensing to create tiny ice crystals. These appear as white streaks across the sky. The display was captured from multiple locations across Israel, including above the Benjamin region, photographed from the settlement of Esh Kodesh, the Hefer Valley, Jerusalem, the Greater Tel Aviv region, and above the settlement of Itamar in the Samaria Regional Council. The phenomenon typically occurs at altitudes of 26,000 feet and above, when temperatures are sufficiently low and humidity levels are suitable. Some condensation trails dissipate within minutes, while others can remain visible for hours, depending on humidity and temperature conditions.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/16/watch-israeli-pilots-touching-tribute-to-hostages/	2024-12-15T22:00:06-08:00	
Where are the billions hidden by the Assad family?	Following the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, a global pursuit has begun to trace billions of dollars hidden by the family over five decades of authoritarian rule. According to an article published in The Wall Street Journal, this investigation—expected to take years—resembles efforts to recover wealth concealed by dictators such as Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi, which yielded only partial success. The Journal reports that the Assad family accumulated its fortune through market manipulation, monopolies, and drug trafficking, primarily Captagon—a drug popular across Arab nations. The family's network spans the globe, with estimated wealth ranging between $1 billion and $12 billion. Much of this wealth was hidden in countries outside the reach of international law or in tax havens, complicating efforts to locate and recover the assets.

Photo: AP Photo/Hussein Malla A 2022 report by the US State Department highlighted how the regime exploited economic manipulation and illicit activities to consolidate power. Bashar al-Assad leveraged the family's economic network to maintain control during his presidency, while his younger brother, Maher, facilitated drug smuggling through his military unit. Revenue from Captagon alone generated an estimated $2.4 billion annually, helping the regime circumvent Western sanctions. Meanwhile, Assad's cousin, Rami Makhlouf, served as the regime's primary financier, dominating sectors like telecommunications, banking, and duty-free services. In 2020, tensions surfaced within the Assad family when Bashar began curbing Makhlouf's influence. Makhlouf was placed under house arrest and stripped of some of his assets, a move analysts interpreted as an attempt to tighten control over Syria's collapsing economy. With the Assad regime's collapse in December 2024, Syrian citizens began taking matters into their own hands. Videos shared on social media showed people looting the family's presidential palace in Damascus, seizing furniture, artwork, and luxury vehicles, including Aston Martins and Lamborghinis.

In one notable case, a French court in 2019 froze €90 million in assets held by Rifaat al-Assad, Bashar's uncle. However, similar efforts to locate assets in Dubai and Russia are expected to face significant challenges due to a lack of cooperation from these nations. One central question in this investigation is the fate of any recovered funds. With Syria now in political chaos and rebel forces vying to fill the power vacuum, it remains unclear how the retrieved wealth will be allocated. Syrian Rebels in Damascus.

'We must return these funds to the Syrian people,' he urged. Beyond legal efforts, international stakeholders hope that recovering the assets could aid in rebuilding Syria and alleviate the severe economic crisis affecting the country, where 70% of the population lives below the poverty line.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/16/where-are-the-billions-hidden-by-the-assad-family/	2024-12-15T20:45:33-08:00	
Senior Hamas official admits: 'October 7 ruined us'	A senior Hamas official currently based in Turkey told Saudi media that the 37th anniversary of the terrorist organization's founding comes during a period of decline due to defeats in Gaza and the broader region. The official disclosed, 'Hamas is suffering from a genuine leadership crisis. The Al-Aqsa Flood attack backfired on us, submerging us in a sea of blood and crises. The most recent blow was the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria, with which Hamas had been attempting to rebuild relations.' According to a report by the Saudi news site Elaph, the Syrian government has ordered Palestinian terrorist groups to shut down their offices, hand over their weapons, dismantle training camps, and leave Syria as soon as possible. The primary Palestinian group active in Syria has been the Islamic Jihad. In contrast, Hamas's political bureau left Syria earlier due to its support for Islamist rebels at the start of the Syrian civil war, which sparked a rift with Assad. Residents of Hama, Syria, welcome the rebels. Photo: AFP Despite this, Elaph reported that senior Hamas official Mohammed Nasser was forced to flee Syria before Syrian rebels captured Damascus. Similarly, Islamic Jihad Secretary-General Ziad Nakhaleh and leaders of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command (PFLP-GC) also had to leave Syria. Nakhaleh recently visited Cairo with a delegation from Islamic Jihad, holding discussions with senior Egyptian intelligence officials about ongoing negotiations for a prisoner exchange deal. He was accompanied by his deputy, Mohammed al-Hindi. Elaph further reported that it is believed senior leaders of Palestinian terrorist organizations have relocated to Tehran. However, it is expected that they will seek other host countries due to fears of targeted assassinations in Iran, as happened to Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas's political bureau chief.

The Hamas official reiterated that the organization's leadership is currently directionless, stating, 'Gaza has been completely destroyed.' He expressed hope that a prisoner exchange deal might slightly alleviate the leadership's dire circumstances. Meanwhile, reports indicate that Hamas leaders operating from Doha have been instructed to maintain a low profile. They have been asked to halt gatherings and refrain from engaging with journalists outside Qatar. Additionally, foreign delegation visits have reportedly been suspended for the time being.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/15/senior-hamas-official-admits-october-7-ruined-us/	2024-12-15T07:01:32-08:00

Israel to close Dublin embassy	Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar ordered the closure of Israel's embassy in Ireland today, marking a significant downturn in bilateral relations while announcing plans to establish a new diplomatic presence in Moldova. The decision to shutter the Dublin mission comes in response to what Sa'ar characterized as the Irish government's 'extreme anti-Israel policies.' The diplomatic relationship had already been strained after Ireland's unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state, which prompted Israel to recall its ambassador. Tensions escalated further last week when Ireland announced it would join South Africa's case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague, which accuses Israel of genocide.

Photo credit: REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne REUTERS 'Ireland's antisemitic actions and rhetoric against Israel are rooted in delegitimization and demonization of the Jewish state and reflect clear double standards,' Sa'ar said. 'Ireland has crossed all red lines in its treatment of Israel. We will redirect our resources toward advancing bilateral relations with countries based on priorities that reflect how different nations relate to Israel.' In contrast, Israel's relationship with Moldova is warm and cooperative, with both countries eager to deepen their diplomatic ties. Moldova already maintains an embassy in Israel, and Sa'ar informed Moldovan Foreign Minister Mihai Popșoi of his decision to establish an Israeli embassy in Chișinău, planned for early 2025. The foreign minister has directed his ministry's director general to secure appropriate premises and initiate the process of appointing an ambassador. 'There are countries interested in strengthening their ties with Israel where we don't yet have diplomatic missions,' Sa'ar noted. 'We will adjust our diplomatic network while considering, among other factors, different countries' approaches and actions toward Israel in the international arena.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/15/israel-to-close-dublin-embassy/	2024-12-15T04:35:18-08:00	
Videos reveal Hamas' brutal treatment of Gazans in prison	The IDF has released disturbing footage from 2023, uncovered by IDF and Shin Bet forces from security cameras at Hamas' 'Al-Katiba' prison, located in the Rimal neighborhood of Gaza City. The footage shows horrific acts of abuse by Hamas prison guards against Gazan detainees, violating even the most basic human rights. Video: Gazan suffers abuse in Hamas prison. Among the disturbing clips, two members of Hamas' Internal Security Apparatus are seen brutally beating a prisoner and even throwing him down a flight of stairs. This apparatus is responsible for detaining and imprisoning Gazan civilians and frequently imposes merciless punishments. The videos prove that Hamas, despite its efforts to dissociate itself from the image of other oppressive regimes in the region, is no less brutal toward the residents of Gaza. This is not the first time 'Al-Katiba' prison has been implicated in severe abuse. Human rights organizations have previously accused Hamas of carrying out unjust and brutal executions at the facility, including against women and numerous civilians. This latest release by the IDF, which follows previous exposés, clearly illustrates the atrocities occurring within Hamas prisons. It reflects the tyrannical nature of Hamas' rule in Gaza and its relentless abuse of the human rights of its own population.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/12/15/videos-reveal-hamas-brutal-treatment-of-gazans-in-prison/	2024-12-15T00:00:37-08:00
