Report: Iran develops nuclear missiles that can hit Israel, Europ...	The British Telegraph reported that Iran is developing missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads with a range of up to 3,000 kilometers, citing information from an exiled opposition group. Additionally, Iran unveiled what it claims to be a new ballistic missile capable of striking targets up to 1,700 km away - well within range of Israel. According to the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), an opposition group, the Ayatollah regime has been using two facilities for missile development, concealing them as communication satellite launch sites. Work at these locations is conducted under strict secrecy and stringent security measures. The report identifies two key facilities where development and production are taking place. The first is located 35 kilometers from the northern Iranian city of Shahroud. The site reportedly employs personnel from the Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research (SPND), which serves as the regime's arm for nuclear weapons development, alongside specialists from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) working on nuclear warheads.

This system, the report claims, would enable Iran to target locations within a 3,000-kilometer range, bringing even European targets within reach. The second site, known as the Imam Khomeini Facility, is situated about 70 kilometers southeast of the central Iranian city of Semnan. At this location, Iran is reportedly developing missiles based on North Korea's Unha-1 rocket, which Pyongyang uses to launch satellites into space. The report indicates that the site contains underground facilities and has seen the addition of new structures over the past decade. The opposition organization shared satellite images with the British newspaper, showing suspicious activity at the site, activity that has previously been reported by international media.

The missile, named Etemad, meaning 'Trust' in Persian, was presented as the latest step in strengthening Iran's defensive capabilities. 'Developing defense capabilities and space technologies... aims to ensure that no country dares to attack Iranian territory,' Pezeshkian said in a televised speech. The path to a nuclear weapon To acquire nuclear weapons, in addition to fissile material, two other key components are required: designing the material into a nuclear warhead (where the processes leading to a nuclear explosion occur) and developing a system capable of delivering the warhead to its target, such as a ballistic missile, aircraft, or another platform.

The first was planetary mixers, which are essential for ballistic missile production. The second, according to a report by journalist Barak Ravid on Axios, was a site in Parchin, where advanced equipment used to create a critical component of a nuclear warhead was reportedly damaged.

Freeing Hostages, ending Hamas rule: Talks on phase two begin	Negotiations on the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement and of hostage deal will begin tomorrow in Washington with a meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff. As stipulated in the initial agreement, talks on the second phase are set to begin on the 16th day of the deal - tomorrow - and it now appears that this is about far more than just another stage in a temporary agreement. Israel seems to be on the path toward a comprehensive diplomatic agreement, with its foundation in Gaza and its head in Saudi Arabia. Netanyahu hinted at this just before his departure when he spoke about broadening the circle of peace. The fact that the talks are being orchestrated by the White House through Ron Dermer and will begin with Netanyahu's own meeting tomorrow, indicates that a significant diplomatic agreement is on the table. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Photo: AP/Evelyn Hockstein Entering the second phase of negotiations Tomorrow, Netanyahu will launch the talks in Washington, while Minister Ron Dermer will act as a senior coordinator on the issue with Witkoff and the US administration moving forward. The actual negotiations will be led by the Israeli negotiating team, headed by Mossad chief David 'Dadi' Barnea, who will only be dispatched for talks with the mediators after receiving directives from the White House. Unlike the previous discussions, which took place in a roundtable format with the participation of the US, Egypt, Qatar, and Israel, this phase will be managed entirely by the White House. Later this week, Witkoff is expected to initiate similar discussions with Qatar's prime minister and senior Egyptian officials, followed by another likely meeting with Netanyahu to coordinate the Israeli delegation's travel schedule for negotiations.

The negotiations will take place through 'shuttle diplomacy' led by Trump administration representatives, moving between Israel and the mediators following this week's discussions in Washington. It is worth noting that Netanyahu seems to have broad support in his coalition for entering negotiations on the second phase of the deal, which also includes long-term arrangements. Even those who had previously insisted on continuing the war at all costs appeared to have softened their stance over the weekend, allowing the Trump administration to present a formula for ending the war without a return to full-scale conflict. Tens of thousands of Gazans head to northern Gaza. Photo: Reuters With both the US and Israel looking toward Saudi Arabia in the next phase, it is important to note that the second phase and the return of the remaining hostages cannot be finalized without a commitment to ending Hamas rule in Gaza—something that would require Hamas representatives to agree to as well. Until now, Hamas has refused any framework that entails ending the war and its governance, thereby forcing Israel to continue fighting. Now, however, the talks will be restarted under new directives from the White House, and possibly a renewed willingness on the part of the Israeli government to bring the war to an end.

Iran says it has powerful new ballistic missile	Iran has revealed what it claimed to be new ballistic missile capable of travelling 1,056 miles, marking a significant display of military technological advancement during a ceremony attended by President Masoud Pezeshkian. Iran's supreme leader arriving at a joint graduation ceremony for cadets from armed forces academies in the Iranian capital Tehran on October 10, 2023 (Khamenei.ir / AFP) The missile, named Etemad – meaning 'trust' in Persian – was broadcast on state television on Sunday, with officials highlighting its substantial range. According to Agence France-Presse, the Iranian defense ministry described it as their 'most recent ballistic missile'. Western nations have increasingly expressed concerns about Iran's expanding ballistic missile program, viewing it as a potential destabilizing factor in the Middle East. The missile's capabilities are particularly notable as it can potentially reach Israel, which Iran targeted twice during the recent Gaza conflict. President Pezeshkian emphasized the strategic importance of the missile, stating in a televised address that the development of defense capabilities 'aims to ensure that no country dares to attack Iranian territory,' Agence France-Presse reported. The unveiling occurred on Iran's national Aerospace Day, just days before the 46th anniversary of the Islamic Republic's establishment on February 10, 1979. This event follows a pattern of military demonstrations that have intensified since the return of US President Donald Trump, who previously pursued a 'maximum pressure' approach towards Iran. Agence France-Presse noted that Tehran has simultaneously signaled openness to restarting negotiations over its nuclear program, a long-standing source of tension with Western countries. Historically forced to develop its own military equipment after US sanctions following the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran has constructed a substantial domestic arsenal. Despite being under an arms embargo during its devastating war with Iraq from 1980 to 1988, the country has since developed an extensive range of domestically produced weapons, including missiles, air defense systems, and drones. The missile's presentation underscores Iran's continued commitment to military self-sufficiency and technological independence in the face of international sanctions and geopolitical pressures.

Trump's vision for a new Gaza – and how Hamas might surrender	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu embarks Sunday on a Washington visit centered around a pivotal Tuesday meeting with President Donald Trump. While the Prime Minister's Office announced a Friday return to Israel, concurrent preparations suggest a possible extension until the following Sunday. The leadership summit will address all major regional and international issues and their interconnections: Gaza ceasefire status, ongoing hostage liberation efforts, and subsequent phases of the hostage agreement. The agenda encompasses Hamas' eradication from Gaza, Iranian threats – particularly nuclear developments, and normalization agreements between Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the broader Arab world. Hamas terrorists secure an area in a square before handing over four Israeli hostages to a Red Cross team in Gaza City on January 25, 2025 AFP / Omar Al-Qattaa Israel Hayom has learned that mass evacuation from Gaza, including both Hamas operatives and those categorized as 'uninvolved population,' represents a cornerstone of American regional strategy – beyond mere public statements as many Israeli observers believe. During his visit, presidential envoy Steve Witkoff's messages indicated that through substantial Gazan emigration, the administration seeks to align Trump's war conclusion objectives with his stance, shared by many in the new administration, that Hamas must cease controlling Gaza. Significantly, during his Israel discussions, Witkoff stressed that considering October 7's atrocities, he too considers future Hamas governance of Gaza untenable. The American perspective holds that with minimal or no population remaining, Hamas control becomes unsustainable. Arab nations oppose relocation plan A phone conversation between Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi took place Saturday following multiple Arab nations' decisive rejection of Gaza evacuation proposals. Egyptian Presidential Palace communications termed the discussion 'positive dialogue' without elaborating. Earlier, foreign ministers of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates issued a joint statement 'rejecting forced Palestinian displacement while expressing readiness to collaborate with Trump on Israeli-Palestinian two-state solution implementation.' Israel would welcome extensive Gaza emigration, with Minister Ron Dermer, the prime minister's envoy, initially presenting the concept to Trump. However, Jerusalem maintains discretion given the matter's sensitivity. Ruling out Hamas 'shadow authority' In exclusive comments to Israel Hayom, a senior Israeli official suggested Hamas might voluntarily surrender Gaza control rather than face war-end demands. 'The option of renewed military action to achieve objectives remains viable, and we stand prepared,' the official stated. However, they consider Hamas leadership's voluntary relinquishment of control the most probable outcome. 'Within Palestinian faction discussions, Hamas recognizes the necessity of transferring authority. Their desire for ceasefire generates momentum for continued hostage releases. Consequently, further warfare might prove unnecessary, with the framework potentially satisfying war objectives,' the senior official told Israel Hayom. However, they emphasized Israel's rejection of any Hamas shadow authority in Gaza – contrasting with Hezbollah's years of Lebanese dominance.

EXCLUSIVE: Trump support revives Israeli plan for voluntary Gaza ...	A confidential document obtained by Israel Hayom reveals that the Ministry of Intelligence prepared an analysis in the second week of the war concluding that 'voluntary humanitarian evacuation of the civilian population from Gaza to other countries worldwide' represents the option that 'will yield positive, long-term strategic results for Israel.' The ministry advocates this approach over alternatives such as installing Palestinian Authority governance in Gaza or fostering local Arab leadership. Drafted before Israel's ground operation in Gaza, the recommendation to facilitate population evacuation was initially aimed at minimizing civilian casualties. While the Biden administration expressed reservations about Gazans leaving the Gaza Strip, and Egypt's firm opposition ultimately led to shelving the idea, Israeli sources now indicate the proposal has gained renewed relevance, particularly given the possibility of resumed combat operations. These sources point to historical precedent, noting that humanitarian corridors for civilian populations proved crucial during the US-led coalition's campaign against ISIS in the previous decade. The document specifically states that 'humanitarian evacuation of the population from the combat zone serves the best interests of Gaza's civilians.' Displaced Palestinians walk on a road in central Gaza to return to their homes in the northern Gaza Strip, Wednesday, Jan. 29, 2025. Photo credit: Abdel Kareem Hana/AP AP The initiative has gained fresh momentum after President Donald Trump recently voiced strong support for Gaza migration during a meeting with Intelligence Minister Gila Gamliel. This prompted renewed work on the plan originally formulated a year ago. Gamliel, who initiated discussions on the second day of the war and engaged with ministers from potential receiving countries last year, had previously suspended the initiative amid international legitimacy concerns and accusations of forced transfer. Current assessments suggest that securing the first country willing to accept Gaza residents could create a domino effect. Israeli officials estimate that 100,000 to 200,000 Gaza residents have already left the Gaza Strip since the war's outbreak, primarily through the Rafah crossing, with most settling in the Cairo area. An additional 1,000 wounded individuals and their escorts have departed via Israel's Ramon Airport to various countries. Professional sources continue to advocate for building international legitimacy around this 'outside-the-box' proposal. The strategy envisions prioritizing wounded individuals and humanitarian cases for initial departures. While experts anticipate initial criticism and backlash, they believe the international community will gradually accept the concept, noting that the right to emigrate is protected under the UN Declaration of Human Rights. US President Donald Trump delivers remarks at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, US, December 16, 2024. Photo credit: Brian Snyder/Reuters Israeli sources consistently emphasize, both now and previously, that the proposal strictly excludes forced evacuation, focusing solely on voluntary migration options, whether temporary or permanent. They stress Israel's commitment to allowing all who choose to leave the ability to return to Gaza at their discretion.

How real are US-Israel plans for Gaza emigration?	The White House is scheduled to inform Israel Tuesday about the timing of the anticipated meeting between President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. While initial preparations point to next week for the summit, final confirmation from the American side remains pending, with the possibility of the meeting taking place the following week. Then-President Donald Trump during an event in New Jersey in 2020 (AP / Alex Brandon) The upcoming summit will see both leaders establishing core policy directives between the new administration and the Israeli government that will shape relations in the months ahead. Priority issues include the Iranian nuclear situation, prospects for Israeli-Saudi peace, the Gaza Strip crisis, and the interconnections between these critical matters. A senior Israeli diplomatic source with direct knowledge indicates that discussions about voluntary migration from Gaza remain at the conceptual stage. The initiative was first raised during early meetings between Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer and Trump following the November election victory, with the White House now exploring potential approaches and ways to convince prospective countries to accept Gaza residents. However, no concrete or mutually agreed-upon plan has emerged. Prime Minister Edi Rama forcefully dismissed claims about Albania's potential role in resettling Palestinians from Gaza, calling such reports 'absolutely untrue' and emphasizing that no one has approached Albania about such an initiative. 'I haven't heard something so false in a long time – and there's been plenty of fake news recently! This is absolutely untrue,' Rama stated in his response to the reports that Trump wanted to have the Balkan country accept relocated Gazans permanently. Trump made similar calls on Arab states, including Jordan and Egypt. While expressing 'full respect and solidarity' for Gaza's residents, who he said have 'suffered greatly due to the violent Hamas regime' and endured war following October 7, Rama emphasized that Albania has not been approached about intervention and cannot take on such responsibility. The Albanian leader highlighted his country's strong relationships across the Middle East, including with Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, and the Palestinian people, whose state Albania recognized years ago. However, he stressed Albania's European identity as a limiting factor. 'Albania is not located in the Middle East, and as a country in the heart of Europe, we cannot do more than any other European country on this matter,' Rama explained.

Israeli officials characterize this action as Hamas's attempt to exert pressure through civilians seeking to return to their homes. Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem stated this morning that they had requested mediators to pressure Israel into permitting Gazans' return to northern Gaza. He indicated ongoing discussions with mediators to develop a solution for opening the Netzarim route. Concerning US President Donald Trump's remarks about Jordan and Egypt needing to absorb more Gazans, Qassem stated that 'Trump's statements are dangerous and align with extreme Israeli right-wing positions.' The IDF Arabic spokesman issued a directive to southern Lebanon residents: 'Do not return to the border villages until further notice.' With the conclusion of the 60-day pause, all readiness units along the northern border were activated to enhance alertness levels.

Trump tells Arab nations to accept Gazans, ends embargo on Israel	President Donald Trump revealed his support for relocating Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring Arab countries and announced the restoration of powerful bomb shipments to Israel, Associated Press reported Saturday. Speaking to reporters during a 20-minute session aboard Air Force One, Trump disclosed that he had lifted restrictions on sending 2,000-pound bombs to Israel. 'We released them today,' Trump said, Associated Press reported. When asked about his reasoning, he added, 'Because they bought them.' The former president discussed his recent conversation with King Abdullah II of Jordan and announced plans for an upcoming discussion with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi about accepting Palestinians from Gaza, AP noted. 'I'd like Egypt to take people,' Trump said, according to Associated Press. 'You're talking about probably a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing and say, 'You know, it's over.'' Kibbutz Nirim in southern Israel bordering the Gaza Strip: a damaged house following the deadly October 7 attack by Hamas terrorists from the Gaza Strip (AFP / Menahem Kahana) AFP / Menahem Kahana Trump praised Jordan's previous acceptance of Palestinian refugees and expressed interest in expanding this approach. 'I'd love for you to take on more, cause I'm looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now, and it's a mess. It's a real mess,' Trump said he told the Jordanian king. The decision to resume bomb shipments marks a departure from his predecessor's policy. President Joe Biden had suspended the delivery of these weapons in May to discourage an Israeli offensive in Rafah. 'Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centers,' Biden told CNN in May, explaining his decision to withhold certain weapons. According to Associated Press, Trump acknowledged Gaza's current state of destruction. 'It's literally a demolition site right now. Almost everything's demolished, and people are dying there,' he said. He suggested his solution would involve working 'with some of the Arab nations, and build housing in a different location, where they can maybe live in peace for a change.' The announcement comes as a temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas continues, allowing for hostage releases and prisoner exchanges. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has not responded to Trump's comments, AP reported. After his inauguration, Trump suggested that Gaza 'really got to be rebuilt in a different way' and called it 'a phenomenal location, on the sea. The best weather, you know, everything is good. It's like, some beautiful things could be done with it,' AP reported.

Amid ceasefire: Gaza terror tunnel discovered near Israel	A year and three months into the war, the shaft of a tunnel was discovered close to the Gaza border. Explosives were found inside, according to information obtained Wednesday by 'Israel Hayom.' Since the ceasefire began, there have been numerous attempts by Gazans to breach the border perimeter. Some instances were met with warning shots, while in other cases, Israeli forces fired to kill in response to infiltrations. During efforts to clear the perimeter, IDF soldiers in southern Gaza located the tunnel shaft. The discovery is particularly concerning given Hamas' ongoing control over significant parts of Gaza and the presence of hundreds of thousands of Gazans in the southern region of the strip. IDF troops in Gaza. Photo: IDF Spokesperson's Unit The proximity of the tunnel shaft to the fence shows that despite aggressive IDF operations in Gaza, the threat of infiltration into Israel persists. This underlines the need for continued efforts to neutralize Hamas, which is reestablishing its control over Gaza. Currently, the IDF is working to establish a series of outposts along the perimeter, which is approximately 700 meters wide in most areas, and as narrow as 400 meters in certain sections.

Israel, Egypt agree on PA management of Rafah Crossing	Israel and Egypt have agreed that the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing will be managed by the Palestinian Authority, under United Nations supervision, according to a report published this morning (Wednesday) in the Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat. According to the report, the agreement on the crossing - the only crossing point between Egypt and and the Gaza Strip - was reached during a meeting between Mossad Director David Barnea, Shin Bet Chief Ronen Bar, and Egyptian intelligence head Hassan Rashad. A source monitoring the Gaza ceasefire implementation confirmed the agreement, but noted that no timeline has been set for the transfer of control or the reopening of the crossing. Philadelphi Corridor, Photo: Reuters Regarding the Philadelphi Corridor, a narrow strip of land along the Gaza-Egypt border, the source said disputes are 'technical and logistical' and are expected to be resolved. Israel has proposed partial withdrawals from the corridor, but Egypt has rejected this approach, demanding a complete withdrawal and a return to the pre-conflict situation. The source also emphasized that during the meeting, the idea of revising the Agreement on Movement and Access at a later stage was discussed. He clarified that all agreements related to the ceasefire are temporary measures, tailored to the current phase.

Gazans return to Jabaliya, Rafah to find ruins	Gazans have begun returning to residential areas that were combat hotspots, including Jabaliya and Rafah, finding their neighborhoods reduced to rubble following IDF operations targeting Hamas terror infrastructure embedded throughout residential areas. One resident, who returned to Rafah, told Arab media, 'The road is no longer paved, buildings are destroyed, and the debris forces us to move across long distances. Fear accompanies us because Israeli forces are still positioned along the Philadelphi Corridor on the southern border.' Another interviewee said, 'We cannot leave our city despite the pain.' Video: Gaza in ruins / Credit: Arab media In western Khan Younis, aid organizations began maintenance operations including laying new water pipes, in an effort to rehabilitate the area's infrastructure following the ceasefire. Meanwhile, in northern Gaza, one resident who returned to Gaza City, found his home reduced to a pile of stones, 'In the first moments of the ceasefire, I felt great joy because I could return home with my family. But when I arrived at the location, I was shocked by the extent of destruction that had befallen all areas, from the al-Saftawi neighborhood in northwest Gaza to Beit Lahia in the northern strip. 'I was in shock when I found my house destroyed. Nothing remained except stones. It's not easy to lose a home, but we will remain on our land no matter the cost. We will live on the ruins of our homes until life returns to normal,' he added. The Rafah municipality began working to open roads for people and vehicle movement. A municipal official said that clearing debris to allow residents to reach their homes is the top priority. 'It's not an easy task but we need to start the process.' Earlier today, the IDF Arabic spokesperson issued a message to Gaza residents, warning them not to approach IDF forces, troop concentration areas in the southern strip, or the maritime space. The statement also noted that movement from south to north Gaza and toward the Netzarim corridor remains dangerous, and instructions about safe routes will be provided later. 'If Hamas adheres to the agreement details, the process of residents returning to northern Gaza could begin as early as next week,' the military said.

Amid the ceasefire, IDF Arabic spokesperson Colonel Avichay Adraee issued a message to Gaza residents today (Tuesday), outlining that 'if Hamas upholds the agreement, starting next week Gazans will be able to return to northern Gaza. 'I want to reemphasize and clarify several points to prevent friction and avoid misunderstandings. We are committed to ensuring all aspects of the agreement are implemented,' Adraee stated in his message. 'As per the agreement, IDF forces maintain positions in various locations throughout Gaza. Everyone must avoid approaching IDF forces in these areas. Coming near the forces poses a direct risk to your safety.' IDF soldiers in the Netzarim Corridor. Photo credit: Hanan Greenwood Adraee emphasized that movement from southern to northern Gaza or toward the Netzarim corridor remains dangerous due to ongoing IDF operations in the area. Once such movement becomes feasible, detailed instructions for safe passage routes will be provided. He included a crucial warning: 'You are cautioned that in southern Gaza, it is extremely dangerous to approach the Rafah crossing area, the Philadelphi corridor area, and any areas where troops are concentrated.' He also highlighted that in the maritime zone along the entire Gaza Strip, there are significant risks for fishermen, swimmers, and divers, who are advised to avoid entering the sea in the coming days. Any movement toward Israeli territory is strictly prohibited, and approaching the buffer zone is forbidden. Getting close to the buffer zone poses extreme danger. As previously stated, if Hamas complies with all aspects of the agreement, beginning next week residents will be permitted to return to northern Gaza, and specific instructions will be issued to the population accordingly.
