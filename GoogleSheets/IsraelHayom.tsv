NYT: Khamenei orders preparation for strike against Israel	Iran's supreme leader has directed military commanders to prepare for an attack against Israel, senior Iranian officials told The New York Times. Three Iranian officials, speaking to The New York Times on condition of anonymity, revealed that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued the directive during a Supreme National Security Council meeting on Monday. The order came after he reviewed reports detailing damage to Iran's missile production facilities, air defense systems, and critical infrastructure from recent Israeli strikes. Gen Ali Fadavi, deputy commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps, declared on Thursday that retaliation was inevitable. 'Iran's response to the Zionist aggression is definite,' Fadavi told Lebanon's Al Mayadeen television station. 'We have never left an aggression unanswered in 40 years. We are capable of destroying all that the Zionists possess with one operation.' The remains of an Iranian missile launched at Israel, Oct. 2, 2024, Arad (Erik Marmor/Getty ImagesErik Marmor/Getty Images) Erik Marmor/Getty ImagesErik Marmor/Getty Images Gholamhossein Mohammadi Golpayegani, head of the supreme leader's office, echoed these sentiments, promising 'a fierce, tooth-breaking response' to what he termed Israel's 'desperate action,' according to Tasnim, a semiofficial news agency affiliated with the Revolutionary Guards. The officials who spoke to The New York Times said military commanders are compiling a list of dozens of potential military targets within Israel. However, they indicated that any attack would likely be delayed until after the American election, citing concerns that regional instability could influence the US presidential race. This latest development follows Iran's launch of approximately 180 ballistic missiles at Israel earlier this month, which Iran characterized as retaliation for Israeli operations against leaders of Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iranian military commanders. Israel responded with strikes on Iranian air defenses near oil refineries, petrochemical facilities, and a major port. While Iranian state media has minimized the impact of Israel's attacks, analysts suggest the strikes effectively compromised key air defense systems around Tehran and energy installations. 'They are willing to take this risk to not appear weak and prove they have a grip on power for both domestic and international credibility,' Sina Azodi, an expert on Iran's military and adjunct professor at George Washington University, told The New York Times. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed Israeli military personnel on Thursday, stating that the recent attacks had enhanced Israel's capability to inflict damage in potential future strikes. 'We hit its underbelly. The boastful talk by the Iranian regime's heads cannot conceal and compensate for the fact that Israel now has greater freedom to operate in Iran than ever before,' Netanyahu said. Gen Ismail Ghaani, commander in chief of the Quds Forces, affirmed Iran's support for Hezbollah, which continues to engage in conflict with Israel along the Lebanese border. The timing and nature of Iran's response remain uncertain, as does whether diplomatic intervention might still prevent further escalation. Iranian officials' public statements could potentially serve as leverage in negotiations, though the supreme leader's direct involvement suggests a serious intent to respond.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/11/01/nyt-khamenei-orders-preparation-for-strike-against-israel/	2024-10-31T23:15:00-07:00

Couple arrested on suspicion of surveilling defense sites for Ira...	Authorities have uncovered an Iranian espionage operation involving a married couple from central Israel who allegedly tracked sensitive security installations and conducted surveillance of a prominent defense researcher. The suspects, both 32, were arrested following an investigation that revealed direct contact with an Iranian intelligence operative. Prosecutors are preparing to file serious charges on Thursday. A joint operation by the Shin Bet security agency and police led to the arrest of Rafael and Lala Guliyev of Lod. The investigation revealed that Rafael Guliyev was recruited by Elshan (Elkhan) Agayev, 56, an Azerbaijani-born operator working for Iranian intelligence, as part of a network targeting Israeli citizens of Caucasus origin. A gas flare on an oil production platform is seen alongside an Iranian flag in the Gulf July 25, 2005 (Reuters/Raheb Homavandi) Reuters/Raheb Homavandi Under Agayev's direction, Guliyev conducted surveillance of several high-security locations, including Mossad headquarters, and gathered intelligence about a researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) whom Iranian operatives had marked for targeting. Guliyev was also tasked with recruiting a potential hit man, with his wife Lala allegedly assisting in several operations. 'These arrests are part of a broader pattern we've uncovered in recent weeks,' a senior Shin Bet official said. 'We've detained multiple Israeli citizens who were carrying out missions for Iranian intelligence. These cases repeatedly demonstrate Iran's persistent efforts to recruit Israeli citizens for espionage and terror operations within Israel.' A high-ranking police official emphasized that law enforcement agencies would maintain their round-the-clock vigilance. 'We will show zero tolerance toward those who collaborate with hostile entities and endanger our citizens and state,' the official stated. In response to the investigation, INSS released a statement, saying, 'The Institute for National Security Studies expresses its profound gratitude to the Shin Bet security agency for preventing the planned operation against our staff member.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/31/iranian-spy-ring-uncovered-couple-accused-of-surveilling-security-sites-tracking-researcher/	2024-10-31T00:45:05-07:00	
Germany closes all Iranian consulates	Germany has decided to close all three Iranian consulates within its borders as a diplomatic response to the execution of Jamshid Sharmahd, a German-Iranian national who Iran accused of terrorism, according to DW. This decision was made public by Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on October 30, 2024. The consulates affected are located in Frankfurt, Hamburg, and Munich, leaving only the Iranian embassy in Berlin operational. Germany has also 'recalled for consultations' its ambassador to Iran, Markus Potzel, for consultations in Berlin following the execution as diplomatic tensions escalate between the two nations, according to Spiegel Politik. The German Foreign Office warned that Iran should expect 'timely measures' in response to the execution. A ministry spokesperson said the killing of a German citizen would 'extremely strain' relations with Iran, which had already been reduced to a minimum. Baerbock strongly condemned the 'murder' of Sharmahd by the Iranian regime. The embassy in Tehran had worked tirelessly on Sharmahd's behalf. A high-ranking team had been sent to Iran multiple times for this purpose. 'Throughout this process, we repeatedly made it unambiguously clear to Tehran that the execution of a German citizen would have serious consequences,' Baerbock stated. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock speaks during a news conference at the German Embassy in Dekwaneh, northern Beirut, Lebanon, Wednesday, Oct. 23, 2024 (Photo: AP/Bilal Hussein) AP This move comes in the wake of escalating tensions due to Sharmahd's execution, which has been internationally criticized as a sham trial. The Foreign Office expressed gratitude for the solidarity shown by European partners, who had also clearly condemned the execution. 'It is also clear that serious consequences loom for EU-Iran relations,' the spokesperson said. The focus would be on 'targeted and significant measures' that would now be pursued jointly. 'In this context, we will naturally also discuss the topic of sanctions.' Iran's judiciary announced Sharmahd's execution on Monday. He had been sentenced to death in spring 2023 in a controversial trial based on terrorism charges. The German government, family members, and human rights activists vehemently rejected the accusations against him. On Tuesday, the Foreign Office had already summoned the chargé d'affaires of the Iranian embassy to convey its sharp protest against the action. Ambassador Potzel had also protested at the Iranian Foreign Ministry in Tehran.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/31/germany-closes-all-iranian-consulates/	2024-10-30T23:30:48-07:00	
Interior Ministry suspends ties with Haaretz after publisher's co...	The Interior Ministry announced Thursday it would suspend all cooperation and advertising with the Haaretz newspaper following controversial remarks made by the paper's publisher, Amos Schocken, at a conference in London where he criticized Israeli policies and called for international sanctions. Speaking at a Haaretz-organized conference, Schocken issued sharp criticism of Israeli policies, described Palestinian attackers as 'freedom fighters,' and claimed Israeli forces were conducting a 'second Nakba' in Gaza. His comments extended to calls for international sanctions against Israel and its leadership, while characterizing government policies in the West Bank and Gaza as an 'apartheid regime.' Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip (IDF Spokesperson's Unit) IDF Spokesperson's Unit The Interior Ministry's official statement described these comments as 'deeply offensive and revealing a fundamental departure from core values, particularly as Israel conducts its most justified war, initiated in response to Hamas's deadly Oct. 7 attack.' Channel 14 correspondent Yishai Friedman reported that Schocken told conference attendees that Prime Minister Benjamin 'Netanyahu's government shows no concern about enforcing cruel apartheid rule over the Palestinian population,' adding that 'achieving a Palestinian state is only possible through sanctions targeting Israel, its opposing leadership, and settlers.' The Interior Ministry's statement emphasized that 'we cannot and will not stand idle while facing attacks on IDF soldiers and the state's efforts to defend its citizens.' The move represents an unprecedented break between a government ministry and a major Israeli news organization.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/31/interior-ministry-suspends-ties-with-haaretz-after-publishers-controversial-london-speech/	2024-10-30T21:00:52-07:00	
Trouble on all fronts: Iran shoots refugees, deports millions, an...	On Saturday night, amid a large-scale aerial strike by the Israeli military on Iranian targets, the Iranian regime faced another attack on its forces. Though the incident was relatively contained, the number of Iranian casualties reportedly exceeded those from the Israeli strikes. Ten Iranian border guards were killed in an assault in Sistan and Baluchestan province. According to Iranian claims, these border guards died in combat on a local road against members of Jaish ul-Adl (Army of Justice), a Sunni terrorist group seeking independence for the Baluchi minority. This organization frequently ambushes and plants explosives targeting Iranian and Pakistani security forces. Sistan and Baluchestan is a persistent trouble spot within Iran, a hotspot of internal conflicts. Just a week before, the area made headlines due to a violent incident in which hundreds of people were killed: Iranian border guards reportedly opened fire on Afghan refugees attempting to cross from Pakistan into Iran, killing approximately 250 people, according to reports. The aftermath of Israel's attack in Iran | Photo: Social media Initially, Iran denied the incident's occurrence, which had been reported by local human rights organizations. Yet afterwards, Tehran's ambassador to Kabul stated that taking 'lawful' action against illegal entry is a legitimate right of all nations, and that border guards are mandated to prevent the entry of unauthorized foreigners. Given that the casualties were Afghan citizens, the Taliban government in Kabul launched an investigation, and the United Nations also sought to look into the incident. UN special rapporteur for human rights in Afghanistan, Richard Bennett, expressed concern about its implications. These two events highlight some of Iran's challenges along its eastern border, particularly at the tri-border area with Afghanistan and Pakistan. This isn't the first incident of Iranian border guards opening fire on refugees trying to cross the border this month. Tehran doesn't publicize these incidents, often denying them outright, but various reports indicate that at least 13 migrants were killed along the border, in this exact same area. The issue of Afghan refugees is a sensitive one in Iran. Many have fled Taliban rule in recent years, with estimates suggesting over a million have entered Iran since the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Overall, Iran claims to host around six million Afghan refugees, many of whom have escaped war, poverty, and hardship over decades. Even the UN refugee agency estimates about four million Afghans are currently in Iran. These refugees place a significant strain on Iran, whose economy is already burdened by international sanctions and struggling with internal challenges. Iran also diverts substantial resources to support armed militias and terrorist organizations across the Middle East and beyond. This international support strains local resources, especially with the added burden of feeding millions more. Iranian President Mahmoud Pazhkyan. Photo: EPA To address the refugee issue, Iran is not only taking border measures against migrants but actively deporting refugees back to Afghanistan. Reports indicate that only in September, Iran expelled over 100,000 people. Many refugees report being beaten, denied basic access to food and water, and detained in special camps by Iranian authorities. Taliban officials claim that since the beginning of the year, nearly half a million refugees have entered Afghanistan from Iran, with the rate increasing. Iran has now set an ambitious target to deport two million undocumented Afghan refugees within six months. However, Iran is not alone in this approach. Both Turkey and Pakistan are also expelling Afghan refugees despite the humanitarian consequences and global outcry. Concerns over the dangers awaiting these refugees back in Afghanistan—economic hardship and potential Taliban persecution—haven't deterred authorities in Tehran, Ankara, or Islamabad from taking these measures. Iran's planned mass deportation program is moving forward, forcibly sending refugees back without judicial oversight or international intervention. Regional conflict with Pakistan In the border regions with Pakistan and Afghanistan, Iran also faces threats from ethnic separatist movements like the one responsible for killing Iranian border guards on Saturday. The Jaish ul-Adl terrorists represent Iran's Baluchi minority, around three percent of the country's population. Alongside Kurds, Sunni Baluchis are among the most persecuted minorities in Iran, which is governed by a Shiite majority. They live in Sistan and Baluchestan in severe poverty, with high unemployment and limited access to basic infrastructure and essential resources such as food and water. Many locals turn to smuggling goods, such as fuel or food, and some are involved in drug trafficking. The conditions in this region have been likened to certain impoverished areas in Africa. Jaish ul-Adl is perhaps the primary voice of Baluchi dissent and terrorism within Iran. Tehran accuses Pakistan and Saudi Arabia in supporting the organization, with hints of Israeli backing as well. This organization has a bloody history with Iranian security forces: in 2019, for example, Jaish ul-Adl killed 13 officers of Iran's Revolutionary Guards in Zahedan, following up with other attacks on Iranian targets. As recently as September, the group claimed responsibility for two attacks on Iranian police, killing three people. In June, they kidnapped nine individuals linked to the Revolutionary Guards, and in April, they carried out five coordinated attacks on Iranian military bases and other sites. The Pakistan Monument in Islamabad. Photo: Shutterstock These escalations prompted Iran to intensify its response. The Iranian military launched drones and missiles into Pakistani territory, targeting what it claimed were extremist training camps linked to Israel. In retaliation, Pakistan carried out a nearly identical strike on Iranian 'terrorist targets,' resulting in seven Iranian deaths. This confrontation led to diplomatic repercussions: Pakistan expelled the Iranian ambassador and withdrew its own representative from Tehran, temporarily downgrading relations. Ten days later, however, the crisis was resolved, with both countries restoring diplomatic ties, and Pakistan even inviting Iran's then-Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian for a visit. Despite this, the diplomatic incident doesn't appear to have soured Pakistan's overall stance towards Iran. Following Israel's airstrikes on Iranian targets, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry issued a harsh condemnation, accusing Israel of full responsibility for escalating regional tensions. A broader regional and global trend After its unsuccessful efforts to stem terrorism or mass migration from Afghanistan through attacks on its neighbors, Iran is now taking another approach. Since mid-month, Iran has resorted to crackdowns on refugees and initiated the construction of physical barriers to control its border. The new initiative began last January, when Iran started building a border fence, wall, and other obstacles along its long eastern border. The project began in Baluchestan with a four-meter-high wall spanning 300 kilometers of Iran's vast border with Pakistan and Afghanistan. The plan aims to cover 1,000 kilometers on each border, with Iran spending an estimated $3 billion on construction, expected to be completed within three years. According to Iranian military officials, the wall aims to control border crossings and stop Afghan refugees from entering. Commentators suggest that the wall represents a shift in Iran's security strategy, emphasizing defensive measures to manage cross-border threats without escalating to open conflicts, as seen in its recent clashes with Pakistan. This trend of constructing physical barriers aligns with similar measures worldwide. While modern threats like drones or rockets often bypass physical defenses, walls still provide protection against terrorism, illegal migration, and trafficking. Pakistan, for instance, is considering similar initiatives along its borders with Iran, just as it has along its Afghan border. Though countries like Israel and the US have faced criticism for building such barriers, this trend continues to grow globally. Despite high costs, walls help control sprawling borders and prevent crises from escalating into broader conflicts. This situation also underscores Iran's need to manage threats on multiple fronts beyond its ongoing tensions with Israel, including resource demands on defense, personnel, and weapons. Iran recently announced a 200% increase in its defense budget—a huge rise reflecting the complex priorities it must balance amid escalating international sanctions and its nuclear ambitions. With rising pressures, Tehran may soon need to make strategic choices on its long-term focus and capabilities.

Despite evidence, Iran denies disruption of missile production	Iranian Defense Minister Aziz Naser Zadeh has stated on Wednesday that the recent Israeli attack over the weekend did not disrupt missile production processes in the Islamic Republic. It is worth recalling that published satellite images revealed that the Israeli attack caused extensive damage, destroying a key Iranian missile production facility on Iranian soil, This satellite photo from Planet Labs PBC shows a damaged large building at the Revolutionary Guard's Shahroud Space Center in Semnan province, Iran, Tuesday Oct. 29, 2024 | Photo: AP/Planet Labs PBC AP On Tuesday, a senior Iranian official mentioned that 'There was minor damage during recent Israeli regime strikes against Iran. With our scientific expertise and power, we immediately compensated for it.' According to reports, Israel attacked a solid fuel mixer plant, crucial for launching the 'Khaibar' and 'Qassem' ballistic missiles, which had been launched towards Israel earlier this month. Reports also indicated that it might take one to two years to repair the damage, effectively incapacitating Iranian missile production capabilities. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi: 'Israel Used Iraqi Airspace'Photo: Arab Networks At the same time, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi declared, 'The Zionist fighter jets used Iraqi airspace against us, which is under American control, and we will pursue this issue through legal action.'

Iran's supreme leader's X account suspended after threats on Isra...	X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, suspended a new Hebrew-language account associated with Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Monday, amid heightened tensions between Iran and Israel. The account, which appeared briefly on Sunday, was suspended by early Monday with a notification stating: 'X suspends accounts which violate the X Rules.' The specific violation was not detailed, and X did not respond to The Associated Press' request for comment. Commuters drive past an anti-Israel billboard covering the facade of a building in Tehran on October 26, 2024 (AFP / Atta Kenare) AFP / Atta Kenare The suspension comes in the wake of Israel's first direct strike on Iranian territory this weekend. In response to the Israeli action, which followed Iran's earlier ballistic missile attack, Khamenei delivered a measured statement on Sunday, saying the strikes 'should not be exaggerated nor downplayed,' while not calling for immediate retaliation. Before its suspension, the account posted its inaugural message in Hebrew, stating: 'In the name of God, the most merciful,' a traditional Islamic greeting as well as a threat to Israel saying, 'The Zionist regime made a mistake, and miscalculated regarding Iran. We will make them understand what power, capability, initiative, and will the Iranian nation has.'' The 85-year-old supreme leader's office has historically maintained multiple X accounts in various languages. This isn't Khamenei's first encounter with social media restrictions. In February, Meta removed his Facebook and Instagram accounts following his expressions of support for Hamas after its October 7 attack on Israel. Iranian citizens are generally unable to access platforms like X and Facebook without using virtual private networks, as these platforms remain blocked within the country. In related developments, Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian has stated that his country will respond 'appropriately' to what he termed Israeli aggression. Speaking on state TV, Pezeshkian said, 'We are not seeking war, but we will defend the rights of our nation and country.' *Iran has reported one civilian casualty from the Israeli strike. The state-run IRNA news agency identified the victim as Allahverdi Rahimpour, a resident of southwestern Tehran, emphasizing he was not affiliated with the armed forces.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/28/irans-supreme-leader-account-suspended-on-x-after-threats-on-israel/	2024-10-28T00:29:24-07:00	
Horrific moment cleric shot dead in Iran captured on tape	The Friday Prayer Imam of Kazeroun in southern Iran was fatally shot on Friday, as reported by IRNA News, marking the third such killing of the provincial town's top cleric since the Islamic revolution of 1979. Mohammad Sabahi succumbed to his injuries at Namazi Hospital in Shiraz despite medical intervention, Kazeroun's governor Mohammad Ali Bekhrad confirmed to IRNA on Friday evening, the anti-ayatollah outlet Iran International reported Saturday. Video: Iranian cleric being shot by attacker in Iran's Kazeroun / Credit: Social Media The shooting occurred after Friday prayers, according to IRNA, which notably avoided characterizing the death as martyrdom – a term typically reserved for deaths with political or religious significance in Iran. Commuters drive along a street in Tehran on October 26, 2024 AFP / Atta Kenare Friday prayer imams, who are appointed by religious authorities under Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei's oversight, hold significant religious and political influence in Iranian communities. Initial reports about the incident were contradictory, with Iranian media first announcing Sabahi's death, then describing his condition as critical. The assailant reportedly took his own life following the attack. Governor Bekhrad dismissed terrorism as a motive, suggesting to IRNA that personal grievances might have prompted the shooting. He indicated that investigations are ongoing. When news of the shooting emerged, claims on a popular Telegram channel that the attacker was a war veteran were quickly refuted by Mehdi Mazarei, head of Kazeroun's Martyrs Foundation, who warned against spreading misinformation. Mizan News, affiliated with Iran's judiciary, reported that the assailant had a criminal history rather than military service. According to their report, the individual had previously attempted to attack a judge with explosives two decades ago, suffering self-inflicted injuries, and served six years in prison for bombing incidents in Gachsaran and other offenses, including weapon theft and bribery. Before his appointment to Kazeroun in November 2019, Sabahi had served as Friday Imam of Kharameh in Fars province for ten years. The town of Kazeroun, with approximately 100,000 residents, has witnessed similar attacks before. In May 2019, Friday Imam Mohammad Khorsand was fatally stabbed after Ramadan prayers. The perpetrator, Hamid Reza Derakhshandeh, was executed within two months. In July 1981, another Friday Imam, Abdolrahim Daneshjou, was shot dead near his home after evening prayers, with state sources attributing the attack to MEK members, now an exiled opposition group in Albania.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/27/horrific-moment-cleric-shot-dead-in-iran-captured-by-camera/	2024-10-26T23:05:00-07:00	
Imagery shows extent of damage to infamous testing facility in Ir...	Israeli airstrikes on Saturday targeted buildings linked to Iran's missile production capabilities, including a facility previously connected to Tehran's nuclear weapons program, according to analysis of commercial satellite imagery shared with Reuters. David Albright, a former UN weapons inspector, and Decker Eveleth, an associate research analyst at CNA, independently assessed that Israel struck facilities in the Parchin military complex near Tehran. The attacks also hit the Khojir missile production site, which Reuters reported in July was undergoing significant expansion. Commuters drive along a street in Tehran on October 26, 2024 (AFP / Atta Kenare) AFP / Atta Kenare 'Israel may have significantly hampered Iran's ability to mass produce missiles,' Eveleth told Reuters. The Israeli military confirmed that three waves of Israeli jets struck missile factories and other sites near Tehran and in western Iran at 3:00 a.m. Saturday, responding to Iran's October 1 barrage of more than 200 missiles against Israel. Iranian military officials characterized the Israeli warheads as 'very light' and said they struck border radar systems in the provinces of Ilam, Khuzestan, and areas surrounding Tehran. Albright, who heads the Institute for Science and International Security research group, said satellite imagery showed Israel damaged multiple buildings at Parchin, including a structure known as Taleghan 2 that was previously used for testing during Iran's Amad Plan nuclear weapons development program. The International Atomic Energy Agency and US intelligence indicate Iran ended this program in 2003, though Iran maintains it never pursued nuclear weapons. Albright, who reviewed program files obtained by Israel's Mossad in 2018, noted that while Iran may have removed key materials before the strike, the building held 'intrinsic value' for potential future nuclear weapons-related activities. One of the sites targeted by Israel in Iran on Oct. 26, 2024 (Reuters) Analysis of Planet Labs satellite imagery by Eveleth revealed that Israeli strikes destroyed three ballistic missile solid fuel mixing buildings and a warehouse at Parchin. Additional strikes hit two similar fuel mixing facilities at the Khojir complex. 'Israel says they targeted buildings housing solid-fuel mixers,' Eveleth explained to Reuters. 'These industrial mixers are hard to make and export-controlled. Iran imported many over the years at great expense, and will likely have a hard time replacing them.' According to Axios, citing three unnamed Israeli sources, the strikes destroyed 12 'planetary mixers' used in producing solid fuel for long-range ballistic missiles, potentially severely limiting Iran's ability to replenish its missile stockpile. US officials say Iran maintains the Middle East's largest missile arsenal and has provided missiles to Russia for use in Ukraine, as well as to Yemen's Houthi rebels and the Lebanese militia Hezbollah. Both Tehran and Moscow deny Russian receipt of Iranian missiles. Earlier satellite imagery analyzed by Eveleth and Jeffrey Lewis of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey showed major expansions at Khojir and the Modarres military complex near Tehran that they assessed were for increasing missile production, as reported by Reuters. Three senior Iranian officials confirmed this assessment.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/27/satellite-images-show-extent-of-damage-to-infamous-testing-facility-in-iran/	2024-10-26T22:38:23-07:00	
Report: Israeli strikes near critical sites cause major concern i...	Israel's strikes early Saturday destroyed air-defense systems protecting several crucial Iranian oil and petrochemical facilities, while deliberately avoiding damage to the facilities themselves, according to Iranian and Israeli officials speaking to The New York Times. The targeted sites included defensive installations at the Bandar Imam Khomeini petrochemical complex in Khuzestan Province, the adjacent Bandar Imam Khomeini port, and the Abadan oil refinery. Additional strikes hit air-defense systems in Ilam Province near the Tange Bijar gas field, officials speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attending a meeting in the command center of the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv on October 26, 2024 (AFP /Government Press Office) AFP /Government Press Office The strategic targeting has sparked serious concerns within Iran, as these critical energy and economic hubs now face potential vulnerabilities in future confrontations between the two nations. 'Israel is sending a clear message to us,' said Hamid Hosseini, an expert on Iran's oil and gas industry and member of the Iran-Iraq Chamber of Commerce. 'This can have very serious economic consequences for Iran, and now that we understand the stakes we need to act wise and not continue the tensions.' Iranian military officials reported that four soldiers working with air defenses were killed in the attacks, with casualties expected to rise. Two of the deceased soldiers were identified as residents of Mahshahr, near the Bandar Imam Khomeini petrochemical complex. According to Israeli officials, initial strike plans developed after Iran's October missile attacks on Israel had included targets connected to Iran's energy industry and nuclear program. However, the United States urged Israel to avoid striking energy, oil, and nuclear facilities directly, fearing such attacks could provoke an escalated Iranian response and potentially trigger a broader regional conflict. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi had previously indicated through diplomatic channels that attacks on energy infrastructure would cross a red line, prompting a forceful response. In a letter to the United Nations on Saturday, Araghchi condemned Israel's actions as 'unlawful and aggressive' and 'against the sovereignty and territorial integrity' of Iran. The Iranian Armed Forces stated that the attacks targeted radar air-defense systems in multiple provinces, causing minor damage. They claimed their defenses successfully neutralized most Israeli missiles and drones, adding that Israeli fighter jets operated from Iraqi airspace without entering Iranian territory. Israeli officials reported that command-and-control trailers and radar systems were among the targets, with post-strike assessments indicating severe damage to the systems. They emphasized that satellite imagery would confirm their precision in targeting only the air-defense battery at the Imam Khomeini petrochemical complex. The strikes also disabled four S-300 air-defense systems purchased from Russia, with one previously neutralized in April near Isfahan Province and three more targeted Saturday at Tehran's Imam Khomeini International Airport and the Malad missile base, according to both Iranian and Israeli officials.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/27/report-iran-strikes-disabled-air-defenses-while-avoiding-infrastructure-damage/	2024-10-26T22:26:47-07:00

Days of Repentance': This is how the Iran operation unfolded	In a significant military operation dubbed 'Days of Repentance,' the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) conducted a series of precision strikes against military targets inside Iran, marking a direct response to Iran's recent attacks on Israel. A page on the Flightradar24 website, taken in Nicosia early on October 26, 2024, displaying commercial flights around Iran's airspace (AFP) AFP The operation began in the early hours Saturday morning as explosions were first reported near Tehran, followed by additional strikes in Syria. The military campaign quickly expanded to include multiple waves of attacks targeting missile production facilities, air defense systems, and ground-to-ground missile launchers across several regions in Iran, including Isfahan, Mashhad, and Kurdistan. Dozens of fighter jets, intelligence aircraft, and refueling planes participated in the operation, striking targets more than 1,600 kilometers (1,200 miles) from Israel. The IDF confirmed that all aircraft returned safely to their bases following the mission's completion. The White House acknowledged the operation, stating they understood Israel was conducting focused strikes against military targets in Iran as an act of self-defense. During the operation, US Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden, who was at his private residence in Delaware, received regular updates on the developments. Explosion in Iran.

Report: This is why Israel's strike was limited	A senior official with direct knowledge of Israel's military strategy revealed that the country deliberately calibrated its recent strike on Iran to provide Tehran with room for a measured response, according to reporting by Washington Post. A page on the Flightradar24 website, taken in Nicosia early on October 26, 2024, displaying commercial flights around Iran's airspace (AFP) AFP The strike was carefully orchestrated to minimize casualties while allowing Iranian authorities to downplay its significance, according to a person briefed on Israel's strategic planning, speaking to Washington Post on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the information. 'Iran's power humiliates the enemies of the motherland,' First Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref wrote on social media, exemplifying Tehran's restrained official response to the incident. The operation represented an expanded version of Israel's April response to Iran's missile and drone barrage, the anonymous source told the Washington Post. During that earlier exchange, Iranian officials had maintained that Israel's strike in central Iran caused no damage. Saudi Arabia's Foreign Affairs Ministry issued a statement condemning the Israeli action, describing it as 'a violation of its sovereignty and a violation of international laws and norms.' The ministry urged all parties to exercise restraint, warning that the widening Middle East conflict 'threatens the security and stability of the countries and people of the region.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/26/sources-this-is-why-israels-strike-was-limited/	2024-10-25T15:36:09-07:00	
US confirms prior knowledge of Israel's air strikes on Iran	The White House confirmed on Friday that it was informed in advance about Israel's air strikes targeting military sites in Iran, according to a US defense official who spoke to AFP. The Israeli attack, which lasted for hours before sunrise in Tehran, targeted military sites, including manufacturing facilities used to produce missiles, ground-to-air missile sites, and additional Iranian air capabilities. A general view of Tehran after several explosions were heard, in Tehran, Iran, October 26, 2024 (Majid Asgaripour (West Asia News Agency)) Majid Asgaripour (West Asia News Agency) The Israeli military described the action as 'precise strikes on military targets' in Iran, characterizing it as an 'exercise of self-defense' in response to ongoing attacks by the Iranian regime against Israel. This indicates that Israel views these strikes as necessary measures to protect its national security interests against perceived threats from Iran. This notice to the United States came after weeks of discussions about avoiding strikes on Iran that could ignite a wider regional conflict, particularly following US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's recent visit to the Middle East. In recent weeks, senior US officials have made their views clear that Israel's response, both in terms of nature and targeted locations, should avoid being unnecessarily escalatory, urging caution to prevent exacerbating regional tensions. Senior US officials have also stated that Israel's response should not affect the global economy, according to a source familiar with the discussions. US President Joe Biden is currently in Wilmington, Delaware. Joe Biden's advisers do not plan to meet in the Situation Room at this time.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/26/us-confirms-prior-knowledge-of-israels-air-strikes-on-tehran-military-sites/	2024-10-25T15:04:15-07:00	
IDF reveals close ties between Hamas, Al-Jazeera	After the IDF released the names of six journalists from Al-Jazeera who were also operatives for Hamas and Islamic Jihad, Lt. Col.

7 arrested in Iran plot to assassinate Israeli nuclear scientist,...	A new espionage case has come to light today (Tuesday), involving seven east Jerusalem residents who were arrested in September. The suspects are accused of planning serious attacks, including assassinations targeting a senior nuclear scientist and a mayor in central Israel. According to investigators, the cell was promised approximately $55,000 for the assassinations. The primary suspect, a 23-year-old from Beit Safafa, confessed during interrogation to establishing contact with an Iranian operative, acknowledging he was working with an enemy state. He admitted to receiving funds from the Iranians and passing crucial information to the cell while recruiting relatives for various missions. According to his testimony, his motives were nationalistic, and he sought to harm the state. He also stated that his connection with the Iranian operative made him feel empowered. The counterfeit police license plate. Photo credit: Israel Police Israel Police During searches of the suspects' homes, police seized approximately $14,000, a counterfeit police license plate, and numerous credit cards. The suspects, aged 19-23, began with relatively simple tasks such as spray-painting graffiti before progressing to more dangerous missions. Their activities included setting fire to two vehicles in Jerusalem, attempting to attack police vehicles, and planning to throw a grenade at a soldier's home – an operation that was ultimately not carried out. As part of their assigned tasks, the suspects spray-painted graffiti associated with the hostages' protest slogans, including messages such as '[Bring them home] now.' Despite his involvement, the suspect was not active in known Iranian groups, and no security-sensitive materials were found in his possession. Prosecutors plan to charge him with aiding an enemy during wartime, along with terrorism-related charges based on his actions and confessions during interrogation. Investigators discovered that the suspects knew the soldier whose home they planned to attack with a grenade. One cell member was acquainted with the Jewish soldier in Jerusalem, and they had begun planning the attack and acquired grenades, but the plot was thwarted before execution. The cell had reached advanced stages of weapons acquisition, including grenades and firearms, intended for attacks against civilians and property. Their primary assigned missions included assassinating a mayor of a city in central Israel and a senior Israeli nuclear scientist, aiming to demonstrate their capability to conduct such operations against Israel. Each suspect has been linked to various incidents, with some facing more serious charges than others. The method of recruitment – whether through online means or other channels – remains under investigation. Indictments are expected tomorrow, including serious charges of aiding an enemy during wartime and conspiracy to commit attacks. Further investigation revealed no involvement of Turkish or Russian entities, unlike in other cases. The connection was directly between the Iranian operative and the cell's main operative. Regarding the planned assassination of the mayor, the cell received detailed information from the Iranian contact and conducted field surveillance. They managed to gather information about their target but were arrested before executing their plan. The investigation also revealed that the Iranian representative did not seek information about Israel's nuclear facility but intended to demonstrate Iran's ability to target Israeli officials, hence ordering the assassination of a senior nuclear scientist. The suspects, arrested in Beit Safafa, had no prior security or criminal records and were not affiliated with known organizations. Credit cards that were seized from the suspects. Photo credit: Israel Police Israel Police Investigators learned that some suspects approached the senior scientist's residence and, for approximately $140, photographed the location to facilitate the planned assassination. While financial gain wasn't the sole motivation, the young suspects acted on nationalistic grounds, receiving minimal compensation for basic tasks. They understood the implications of their actions and the risk to national security. Upon completing the investigation, prosecutors gathered sufficient evidence against the suspects and filed a prosecutor's statement earlier this week. Their detention has been extended until Oct. 24, and the Jerusalem District Attorney's Office is expected to file indictments for serious security offenses. According to a senior Shin Bet official, 'Intelligence gathered by the security establishment indicates that scientists, mayors, senior defense officials, and other Israeli officials are targeted by Iranian entities.' This investigation once again exposes Iran's efforts to recruit and exploit Israeli citizens and residents, including east Jerusalem residents, to advance attacks in Israel. Israel's security agencies, including the Shin Bet and Israel Police, will continue their collaborative efforts to detect Iranian activity and prosecute all those involved in such operations to the fullest extent of the law. The police stated: 'The Jerusalem District Police and the Shin Bet continue to focus their counterterrorism efforts against threats at all times and locations, working to protect Israeli citizens. In recent days, following another joint investigation, an indictment was filed against a suspect from the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood in east Jerusalem, who had planned an attack against hostages' families protesters in Tel Aviv.' It was revealed on Monday that seven Jewish Israelis, including two minors, have been detained since September on suspicion of spying for Iran. They allegedly operated for hundreds of thousands of shekels, and today prosecutors filed a statement requesting their detention until the end of proceedings. Security officials are still trying to understand how they operated under the radar for about two years without detection by the Shin Bet, IDF, police, and Mossad.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/22/7-east-jerusalem-residents-arrested-in-iran-directed-plot-to-assassinate-israeli-nuclear-scientist-mayor/	2024-10-21T23:00:15-07:00

Iran-led espionage ring run by Jews who made aliyah uncovered in ...	Seven Israeli Jews, including two minors aged 16 and 17, as well as a father and son, have been in custody since September on suspicion of serious espionage for Iran in exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars. On Monday, a prosecutor's statement was submitted against them with a request to extend their detention until the end of the proceedings, while the security establishment is still investigating how they operated for two years under the radar of the Shin Bet, IDF, police, and Mossad. On Friday, the prosecution is expected to file an indictment against them in the Haifa District Court for a series of serious security offenses. The suspects are Aziz Nisanov, Alexander Sadikov, Yigal Nisan, Vyacheslav Gushchin, Yevgeny Yoffe (and two minors). They are all Israeli Jews who immigrated from Azerbaijan. The adults among them did not serve in the IDF and were not employed at security facilities that they documented as part of their espionage activities. They are residents of the northern area of Krayot and Haifa, who received their citizenship under the Law of Return and through other methods that are still under investigation. First responders in Caesarea in northern Israel near Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's home (Shmuel Buchris) Shmuel Buchris The seven are expected to be charged with aiding the enemy during wartime, an offense punishable by death or life imprisonment. The police reject the assessment that the seven were part of Hamas's decision to invade the border communities on October 7, but emphasize that 'every missile fired towards the country in the last two years from Gaza, Lebanon, or Iran reached places they photographed and sent to the Iranians, especially in the last year.' Among other targets, the suspects photographed the Golani training base, where a Hezbollah drone struck and killed four IDF soldiers. The investigation reveals that this is an espionage case, directed by two Iranian agents, which lasted about two years but was exposed a few months ago following information received by the Shin Bet. Due to the real concern that the espionage efforts would harm Israelis, the investigation of the case became public before the completion of the covert investigation against them. The seven were arrested on September 19. 'This is one of the most serious events investigated ever,' the head of the security division at Lahav 433 Major Crimes Unit Chief Superintendent Yaron Binyamin said. 'It seems we have too many such people in the country, and it's very troubling.' From the investigation details, it emerged that the seven carried out between 600 and 700 espionage missions for Iran over two years. They documented sensitive security facilities, military bases, and human targets, the last of which was the commander of the Nevatim base and his son. According to investigators, in the Iranian attack that took place on Oct. 1, 2024, Iran launched ballistic missiles across Israel towards targets that the seven had documented, including the Nevatim and Ramat David Air Force bases and the Mossad headquarters in Glilot. Additionally, it was revealed that after the missile attack, the seven were sent by Iran to check the accuracy and damage caused to improve in the future. The police and Shin Bet are still investigating whether the seven collected and surveilled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's home in Caesaria, which was targeted by a Hezbollah drone late last week. In their investigation, the seven said they 'became addicted to the money paid to them' totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars transferred to them in cryptocurrency, in an encrypted manner, through exchange stores in the country, and even several times through Russian couriers who came to the country and transferred the funds to them in meetings they held with them. 'We know about the systematic way in which the group operated,' Chief Superintendent Binyamin said. 'We caught dozens of documents listing which facility to photograph, which facility to gather information on, and how much money they were supposed to earn from it. The method of operation was receiving a mission, such as photographing, driving to the location, unloading from the vehicle, taking a high vantage point, photographing, and transferring the documentation in short ranges to Iran using encrypted software.' It also turns out that the group's leader was recruited in Turkey in the past and had already activated Israelis in other cases that were recently exposed. Unlike other cases, this involves espionage that lasted about two years. It should be noted that the Iranians do not work directly with Israelis, and to recruit them, they operate through intermediaries. In this case, too, the Iranians used a Turkish intermediary named Al Hassan, who had already activated Israelis in short espionage missions in the past. As far as is known, arrests related to the case have recently been made in Turkey and Azerbaijan. Iranian Protesters unveil a digital countdown showing 8411 days until Israel is destroyed in Tehran, Iran, Friday, June 23, 2017 (AP/Ebrahim Noroozi) AP/Ebrahim Noroozi Details of the investigation reveal that the seven knew at some stage or another that the materials they collected were being transferred to Iran. The severity of the acts became clear during the overt investigation and in the covert wiretapping placed on them. 'We clearly understood that they were thirsty for missions because they were thirsty for money. They asked each other 'So when is the next mission'. Sometimes they performed three or four missions a day,' Binyamin said. 'The method was to receive a mission in an ascending order. Two years ago, they received simple missions and then it gradually increased. This is an exceptional event by any measure. I don't know of a terror cell that operates systematically and primarily for such a long period and executes. I don't know whether to be happy or sad on this day, on one hand, there's satisfaction, on the other hand, it's very troubling in what reality we live.' Three of the seven were caught red-handed while they were near the home of the commander of the Nevatim base in southern Israel, and were on a mission to monitor him and his son. 'This was the mission that led to the decision to break into the investigation because we didn't want to take the risk of harm to human life. They were directed by the Iranians on which day and at what time to photograph the home of the Nevatim commander. This was supposed to happen at the time his son was expected to leave the house,' Binyamin said, adding that unlike other cases where contact with the Iranians was, among other things, through social networks, in this case, the contact with them was physical. 'The investigation material is crazy,' he adds. A senior Shin Bet official said, 'As part of the investigation, many materials were seized that were collected by the members of the infrastructure and transferred to Iranian agents, including photographs and videos of many IDF bases across the country, ports, energy infrastructures in Israel, all while the State of Israel is fighting on several different fronts. The assessment is that the activities of the infrastructure members led to security damage to the state's security.' The police said the following in a statement: 'During the overt investigation, the severity of the events and their scope were revealed, which are among the most serious that the State of Israel has known. The suspects acted with knowledge of their actions and out of greed for money - and harmed the State of Israel and its citizens.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/22/tep/	2024-10-21T15:10:13-07:00	
Iran-led espionage ring run by Jews who made aliyah uncovered in ...	Seven Israeli Jews, including two minors aged 16 and 17, as well as a father and son, have been in custody since September on suspicion of serious espionage for Iran in exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars. On Monday, a prosecutor's statement was submitted against them with a request to extend their detention until the end of the proceedings, while the security establishment is still investigating how they operated for two years under the radar of the Shin Bet, IDF, police, and Mossad. On Friday, the prosecution is expected to file an indictment against them in the Haifa District Court for a series of serious security offenses. The suspects are Aziz Nisanov, Alexander Sadikov, Yigal Nisan, Vyacheslav Gushchin, Yevgeny Yoffe (and two minors). They are all Israeli Jews who immigrated from Azerbaijan. The adults among them did not serve in the IDF and were not employed at security facilities that they documented as part of their espionage activities. They are residents of the northern area of Krayot and Haifa, who received their citizenship under the Law of Return and through other methods that are still under investigation. First responders in Caesarea in northern Israel near Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's home (Shmuel Buchris) Shmuel Buchris The seven are expected to be charged with aiding the enemy during wartime, an offense punishable by death or life imprisonment. The police reject the assessment that the seven were part of Hamas's decision to invade the border communities on October 7, but emphasize that 'every missile fired towards the country in the last two years from Gaza, Lebanon, or Iran reached places they photographed and sent to the Iranians, especially in the last year.' Among other targets, the suspects photographed the Golani training base, where a Hezbollah drone struck and killed four IDF soldiers. The investigation reveals that this is an espionage case, directed by two Iranian agents, which lasted about two years but was exposed a few months ago following information received by the Shin Bet. Due to the real concern that the espionage efforts would harm Israelis, the investigation of the case became public before the completion of the covert investigation against them. The seven were arrested on September 19. 'This is one of the most serious events investigated ever,' says the head of the security division at Lahav 433 special crimes unit Yaron Binyamin said. 'It seems we have too many such people in the country, and it's very troubling.' From the investigation details, it emerged that the seven carried out between 600 and 700 espionage missions for Iran over two years. They documented sensitive security facilities, military bases, and human targets, the last of which was the commander of the Nevatim base and his son. According to investigators, in the Iranian attack that took place on Oct. 1, 2024, Iran launched ballistic missiles across Israel towards targets that the seven had documented, including the Nevatim and Ramat David Air Force bases and the Mossad headquarters in Glilot. Additionally, it was revealed that after the missile attack, the seven were sent by Iran to check the accuracy and damage caused to improve in the future. The police and Shin Bet are still investigating whether the seven collected and surveilled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's home in Caesaria, which was targeted by a Hezbollah drone late last week. In their investigation, the seven said they 'became addicted to the money paid to them' totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars transferred to them in cryptocurrency, in an encrypted manner, through exchange stores in the country, and even several times through Russian couriers who came to the country and transferred the funds to them in meetings they held with them. 'We know about the systematic way in which the group operated,' says Lieutenant Colonel Binyamin. 'We caught dozens of documents listing which facility to photograph, which facility to gather information on, and how much money they were supposed to earn from it. The method of operation was receiving a mission, such as photographing, driving to the location, unloading from the vehicle, taking a high vantage point, photographing, and transferring the documentation in short ranges to Iran using encrypted software.' It also turns out that the group's leader was recruited in Turkey in the past and had already activated Israelis in other cases that were recently exposed. Unlike other cases, this involves espionage that lasted about two years. It should be noted that the Iranians do not work directly with Israelis, and to recruit them, they operate through intermediaries. In this case too, the Iranians used a Turkish intermediary named Al Hassan, who had already activated Israelis in short espionage missions in the past. As far as is known, arrests related to the case have recently been made in Turkey and Azerbaijan.

The severity of the acts became clear during the overt investigation and in the covert listening devices placed on them. 'We clearly understood that they were thirsty for missions because they were thirsty for money. They asked each other 'so when is the next mission'. Sometimes they performed three or four missions a day,' says Lieutenant Colonel Binyamin. 'The method was to receive a mission in an ascending order. Two years ago, they received simple missions and then it gradually increased. This is an exceptional event by any measure. I don't know of a terror cell that operates systematically and primarily for such a long period and executes. I don't know whether to be happy or sad on this day, on one hand there's satisfaction, on the other hand it's very troubling in what reality we live.' Three of the seven were caught red-handed while they were near the home of the commander of the Nevatim base in southern Israel, and were on a mission to monitor him and his son.

Sinwar didn't fight, he hid under 3 blankets': A look inside Raf...	Just over a year ago, the idea of an Israeli civilian setting foot in Gaza seemed unthinkable. Today, that scenario has become a reality, as evidenced by an Israel Hayom reporter standing inside the Rafah home where Hamas's top leader met his end. This location will undoubtedly be etched into the annals of Jewish history. The house where the mass murderer met his end is located a mere 18-minute drive from the Israeli point at Kibbutz Kerem Shalom. Despite its proximity to the border, military officials believe Sinwar calculated this urban location, less than a mile from the sea, as his safest option. Speculations suggest he was attempting to reach the civilian area of al-Mawasi, Rafah, to blend in among the civilians or possibly access tunnels in Rafah for an escape to Egypt. It's unlikely he anticipated IDF forces reaching his hideout. And they did. Video: Footage from an IDF drone showing Yahya Sinwar moments before his elimination Blood drops on the entrance wall alerted approaching soldiers to a presence inside. They strategically retreated, regrouping with additional firepower and drone support before the famous footage was captured. The house lies in ruins. On the second floor are two orange sofas, on one of which Sinwar sat in his final moments. It's hard to shake off the thought, which is even a bit satisfying, that when Sinwar sat on the sofas, wounded, bleeding, dying, and looked out through the wall, he saw the results of his actions – Gaza dismantled, broken, destroyed, in ruins. Sinwar was alone when found. His security detail had scattered in the face of pursuing IDF forces, with members fleeing to nearby buildings. Every Israeli can find some solace in knowing that in his final moments, with Hamas leadership decimated and Gaza in ruins, Sinwar must have realized the futility of his actions – a suicide mission from which he and his comrades would never return. Contrary to the false Palestinian narrative, Sinwar did not fight. Even the pathetic stick-throwing wasn't fighting. The soldiers who eliminated him say that he covered himself with three blankets and tried to hide behind furniture. He wasn't a great fighter, more of a cowardly flea. Sinwar's body being removed by the IDF Lt. Col. Gilad Pasternak, Deputy Commander of the brigade, appears in the famous image of soldiers standing over Sinwar's body. For Pasternak, this mission closed a personal circle – a decade after being wounded in battle in Beit Hanoun in the northern Gaza Strip, he now stood over the body of Israel's most wanted enemy. 'This is closure. Sinwar was responsible for that incident, he planned and carried it out, and now he was lying dead here,' Pasternak said. 'There's great pride throughout the country – in our fighters, our commanders, and all our soldiers. You see in front of you the one who murdered so many Israelis, caused so much suffering to so many Israelis lying thrown, pathetic, as he deserves. The feeling is one of satisfaction. Justice done. Joy over an operational achievement and the professionalism of the soldiers. Now we have to win the war to bring back the hostages.' Pasternak emphasized that Sinwar did not die fighting. 'We know what combat looks like, and this wasn't it. This was a man fleeing and hiding. Someone who fights doesn't cower under blankets or make feeble attempts to throw sticks. Real combat looks entirely different.' The journey to Tel Sultan, where Sinwar was found, is as significant as the final hideout itself. The Philadelphi Corridor is well paved and has two lanes, and now they're already marking driving arrows with spray paint as if it were a road in Tel Aviv. The destruction in Rafah is evident, with neighborhoods reduced to rubble and infrastructure in shambles. The destruction cannot be conveyed in words or pictures. Along the route, there are infrastructure works. It's doubtful anyone intends to leave the place anytime soon. One of the orange armchairs Sinwar sat in in his final moments. Photo credit: Yehuda Shlezinger Lt. Col. Pasternak shared his feelings: 'There's no joy over the destruction of innocent lives, but we all understand that they brought this upon themselves.' At the entrance to the house stood Brigade Commander Sivan Bloch. 'I'm interviewing on behalf of my soldiers and commanders, I'm just representing them, they did a wonderful and difficult job,' he said. He then recounted the elimination of Sinwar: 'The brigade took the Rafah area for defense and offensive missions. We carried out ambushes. A very alert soldier identified suspicious movement, two blocks from here, 650 feet to the south.' 'He then mobilized forces. Trackers identified footprints, moved from detection to detection, reached the house, and heard voices. Sinwar's cell gets nervous and flees to the house next door. That's where the first encounter took place. The cell fleed, they didn't fight or anything. The force hit some of them, and they scattered from fear. Sinwar fled to this house. One terrorist and two others fled to nearby houses. The battalion strived for contact. A soldier was wounded in the encounter, the soldier is from the Druze community. And it should be noted that this operation involved Israelis from all sectors of society – Druze, religious, secular, everyone participated. That's one of the remarkable aspects of this event.' He continued with the dramatic description. 'Blood stains were identified at the entrance to the stairs and the soldiers understood that there was someone there, they took back, brought tanks, and identified terrorists, yet still didn't understand that it was Sinwar. They carried out fire until he was killed.' The blood-stained wall. Photo credit: Yehuda Shlezinger 'You could see Sinwar's pathetic state,' Bloch said. 'With a stick, covered face, not really a battle going on, there wasn't any real fighting happening. On the contrary, he was trying to hide, to conceal himself, to cover himself with things. Although they didn't understand who it was, the soldiers were doing a wonderful job.' The operation continued through the night, with forces eliminating the remaining members of Sinwar's cell by 6 a.m. It was only when scanning the area with drones that they identified Sinwar's face. 'We joked that it resembled Sinwar. As verification came in, we realized this was far more significant than just another terrorist neutralized by our battalion.' Bloch emphasized that Sinwar's elimination, while significant, is not the end of their mission. 'Killing Sinwar doesn't mean our job is done. We'll continue to capture terrorists, eliminate threats, and dismantle their infrastructure. We must remain vigilant to prevent Hamas from regrouping. Our ongoing operations are crucial to Israel's security.' The brigade commander bristled at suggestions that Sinwar's elimination was mere luck. 'This wasn't a fluke,' he stated firmly. 'I've heard people saying it was, but that's simply not true. This was the result of our soldiers' relentless hard work and dedication to bringing victory to Israel.' Despite the magnitude of their achievement in eliminating Hamas' top leader, Bloch and his soldiers didn't engage in overt celebrations. 'Our celebration was continuing our mission – conducting more ambushes, maintaining our operational tempo. There were no barbecues or fireworks. Our bulldozers kept working, our soldiers remained active. We're proud of what we've accomplished, and we're glad it brings some comfort to our nation. But our work continues.'	https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/10/21/sinwar-didnt-fight-he-hid-under-3-blankets-a-look-inside-rafah/	2024-10-20T20:00:51-07:00
