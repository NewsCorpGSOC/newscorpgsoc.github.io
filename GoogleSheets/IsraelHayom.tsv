Amid ceasefire: Gaza terror tunnel discovered near Israel	A year and three months into the war, the shaft of a tunnel was discovered close to the Gaza border. Explosives were found inside, according to information obtained Wednesday by 'Israel Hayom.' Since the ceasefire began, there have been numerous attempts by Gazans to breach the border perimeter. Some instances were met with warning shots, while in other cases, Israeli forces fired to kill in response to infiltrations. During efforts to clear the perimeter, IDF soldiers in southern Gaza located the tunnel shaft. The discovery is particularly concerning given Hamas' ongoing control over significant parts of Gaza and the presence of hundreds of thousands of Gazans in the southern region of the strip.

Photo: IDF Spokesperson's Unit The proximity of the tunnel shaft to the fence shows that despite aggressive IDF operations in Gaza, the threat of infiltration into Israel persists. This underlines the need for continued efforts to neutralize Hamas, which is reestablishing its control over Gaza. Currently, the IDF is working to establish a series of outposts along the perimeter, which is approximately 700 meters wide in most areas, and as narrow as 400 meters in certain sections.

Israel, Egypt agree on PA management of Rafah Crossing	Israel and Egypt have agreed that the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing will be managed by the Palestinian Authority, under United Nations supervision, according to a report published this morning (Wednesday) in the Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat. According to the report, the agreement on the crossing - the only crossing point between Egypt and and the Gaza Strip - was reached during a meeting between Mossad Director David Barnea, Shin Bet Chief Ronen Bar, and Egyptian intelligence head Hassan Rashad. A source monitoring the Gaza ceasefire implementation confirmed the agreement, but noted that no timeline has been set for the transfer of control or the reopening of the crossing. Philadelphi Corridor, Photo: Reuters Regarding the Philadelphi Corridor, a narrow strip of land along the Gaza-Egypt border, the source said disputes are 'technical and logistical' and are expected to be resolved. Israel has proposed partial withdrawals from the corridor, but Egypt has rejected this approach, demanding a complete withdrawal and a return to the pre-conflict situation. The source also emphasized that during the meeting, the idea of revising the Agreement on Movement and Access at a later stage was discussed. He clarified that all agreements related to the ceasefire are temporary measures, tailored to the current phase.

Gazans return to Jabaliya, Rafah to find ruins	Gazans have begun returning to residential areas that were combat hotspots, including Jabaliya and Rafah, finding their neighborhoods reduced to rubble following IDF operations targeting Hamas terror infrastructure embedded throughout residential areas. One resident, who returned to Rafah, told Arab media, 'The road is no longer paved, buildings are destroyed, and the debris forces us to move across long distances. Fear accompanies us because Israeli forces are still positioned along the Philadelphi Corridor on the southern border.' Another interviewee said, 'We cannot leave our city despite the pain.' Video: Gaza in ruins / Credit: Arab media In western Khan Younis, aid organizations began maintenance operations including laying new water pipes, in an effort to rehabilitate the area's infrastructure following the ceasefire. Meanwhile, in northern Gaza, one resident who returned to Gaza City, found his home reduced to a pile of stones, 'In the first moments of the ceasefire, I felt great joy because I could return home with my family. But when I arrived at the location, I was shocked by the extent of destruction that had befallen all areas, from the al-Saftawi neighborhood in northwest Gaza to Beit Lahia in the northern strip. 'I was in shock when I found my house destroyed. Nothing remained except stones. It's not easy to lose a home, but we will remain on our land no matter the cost. We will live on the ruins of our homes until life returns to normal,' he added. The Rafah municipality began working to open roads for people and vehicle movement. A municipal official said that clearing debris to allow residents to reach their homes is the top priority. 'It's not an easy task but we need to start the process.' Earlier today, the IDF Arabic spokesperson issued a message to Gaza residents, warning them not to approach IDF forces, troop concentration areas in the southern strip, or the maritime space. The statement also noted that movement from south to north Gaza and toward the Netzarim corridor remains dangerous, and instructions about safe routes will be provided later. 'If Hamas adheres to the agreement details, the process of residents returning to northern Gaza could begin as early as next week,' the military said.

Amid the ceasefire, IDF Arabic spokesperson Colonel Avichay Adraee issued a message to Gaza residents today (Tuesday), outlining that 'if Hamas upholds the agreement, starting next week Gazans will be able to return to northern Gaza. 'I want to reemphasize and clarify several points to prevent friction and avoid misunderstandings. We are committed to ensuring all aspects of the agreement are implemented,' Adraee stated in his message. 'As per the agreement, IDF forces maintain positions in various locations throughout Gaza. Everyone must avoid approaching IDF forces in these areas. Coming near the forces poses a direct risk to your safety.' IDF soldiers in the Netzarim Corridor. Photo credit: Hanan Greenwood Adraee emphasized that movement from southern to northern Gaza or toward the Netzarim corridor remains dangerous due to ongoing IDF operations in the area. Once such movement becomes feasible, detailed instructions for safe passage routes will be provided. He included a crucial warning: 'You are cautioned that in southern Gaza, it is extremely dangerous to approach the Rafah crossing area, the Philadelphi corridor area, and any areas where troops are concentrated.' He also highlighted that in the maritime zone along the entire Gaza Strip, there are significant risks for fishermen, swimmers, and divers, who are advised to avoid entering the sea in the coming days. Any movement toward Israeli territory is strictly prohibited, and approaching the buffer zone is forbidden. Getting close to the buffer zone poses extreme danger. As previously stated, if Hamas complies with all aspects of the agreement, beginning next week residents will be permitted to return to northern Gaza, and specific instructions will be issued to the population accordingly.

Israel's biggest threat is its marginalization by international ...	Among Israel's numerous supporters in Washington, certain figures have distinguished themselves through exceptional dedication to the Jewish state's cause. Senator Lindsey Graham, the veteran Republican from South Carolina, exemplifies this unwavering commitment. During our Thursday afternoon conversation in his office, his staff was shepherding through the Senate a heartfelt farewell resolution for departing Israeli Ambassador Mike Herzog. The unanimous support from all 100 US senators underscored the deep respect for Herzog. Graham's selection to deliver remarks at the ambassador's farewell ceremony hours later highlighted the senator's remarkable dedication to Israel within a single day. His steadfast support for Israel, recognized across party lines, has positioned him as a unique mediator between Israel and Saudi Arabia on behalf of the US, both before and during the current conflict. Throughout his frequent wartime visits to Israel, and again in his Senate office last weekend, Graham emphasized a consistent message: 'The greatest threat to Iran was the normalization between Israel and Arab states. The attitude of Saudi and UAE leadership toward Israel represents the most significant transformation I've witnessed in my lifetime. Don't let this opportunity slip away. I believe Oct. 7 was designed to derail this process because we were so close to a breakthrough. I refuse to let those bastards in Iran succeed. The key is to always do what your enemy despises most.' In practical terms, Graham advocates for Israel to consider allowing a moderate Arab state to assume control of the Gaza Strip. 'MBS and MBZ [Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed] want Hamas gone at least as much as you do. I can state this with absolute certainty. However, it remains Israel's sovereign decision whether to accept a Palestinian component or to maintain that a Palestinian state poses an unacceptable security risk and therefore must be opposed.' US Senator Lindsey Graham (L) and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (R).Photo credit: Haim Zach/GPO Q: What course of action should Trump take regarding Iran? 'While I don't speak for the administration, I believe we face an unprecedented opportunity to diminish Iran's power in a way I've never witnessed before. Israel and Trump's America must act decisively to eliminate Iran's nuclear facilities permanently.' Graham demonstrated an intimate knowledge of Israel's situation and comprehended the criticism and resistance to the hostage deal. When asked if the US would have accepted such terms in Israel's position, Graham thoughtfully responded: 'That's a good question. I understand the concerns about freed terrorists returning to combat against Israel, but their operational capacity is now severely limited, and Israel retains the option to resume operations at any moment. The ceasefire isn't intended to provide Hamas with a rehabilitation period. That simply won't be permitted to happen. However, I prioritize getting the hostages out, and in the Middle East, I see no alternative to this cycle of releasing perpetrators. It's 'Sophie's Choice.'' Graham, advancing legislation to constrain the International Criminal Court in The Hague, stateed: 'In my assessment, Israel's greatest threat isn't Iran but rather its potential isolation by international institutions.' Q: Regarding the proposed legislation that would impose US sanctions on countries cooperating with the International Criminal Court (ICC), when do you expect its passage, and what drives this initiative? 'I believe Israel's biggest threat isn't Iran's nuclear program, but rather its systematic marginalization by international bodies. BDS, the persecution of IDF personnel, and economic isolation – these are all serious concerns. Consequently, the ICC issue holds historic significance for the Jewish state. Moreover, it threatens American interests as we're next in their sights. Neither of our nations belongs to this court, yet they presume to issue arrest warrants against us. 'That's why next week we're introducing bipartisan legislation that will prohibit countries cooperating with the court from engaging in business with America. This will fundamentally alter the existing paradigm, and I'm unmoved by whatever international pressure may come my way.'

US partially lifts arms embargo on Israel ahead of ceasefire	The United States has begun lifting key restrictions from its arms embargo on Israel, with approximately 70 D9 bulldozers now cleared for shipment, according to security sources. While the hostage agreement was set to begin Sunday morning, the IDF announced that the implementation is delayed as Hamas has not yet provided the list of hostages scheduled for release. The bulldozers represent a portion of a comprehensive 130-vehicle acquisition agreement signed approximately ten months ago, a deal that had remained suspended under the American arms embargo. Sources familiar with the matter told Israel Hayom that the authorization for the bulldozer transfer emerged from extensive negotiations with American administration officials, integrated within the broader framework of the hostage deal discussions. On operational activity in Gaza (IDF Spokesperson's Unit) Military officials emphasize the critical battlefield significance of these engineering vehicles in Gaza Strip operations. The heavy-duty bulldozers serve multiple essential functions: establishing secure movement corridors, creating access routes for combat forces, and detecting explosive devices. Their reinforced design enables them to withstand explosive impacts while maintaining operational capability. According to security sources, the availability of this equipment during recent military operations could have significantly reduced casualties from explosive devices among military personnel. The decision to release the equipment follows October's temporary weapons halt, which the Biden administration implemented as leverage to facilitate humanitarian aid access to Gaza.

Gazans flood back to Jabaliya despite IDF warnings	Gazans began to stream back to Jabaliya Sunday morning despite explicit IDF warnings that the planned ceasefire remains delayed, as Hamas has yet to provide the list of hostages scheduled for today's release. Arab media networks show significant civilian movement northward, even though the 8:30 a.m. planned start time has passed without implementation. Video: Gazans return to Jabaliya ahead of ceasefire / Arab media The IDF's Arabic-language spokesman, Avichay Adraee, issued urgent warnings, 'IDF forces continue operating in multiple locations throughout the strip. Any approach toward these forces puts civilian lives at risk.' Adraee emphasized that military positions are being maintained across Gaza until the ceasefire formally begins and highlighted specific danger zones, particularly along the Netzarim route in northern Gaza and near the Shaath area in southern Rafah. The Rafah municipality has reinforced these directives, warning residents to avoid areas near the Egyptian border.

IDF: Truce stalls as Hamas withholds hostage list	The anticipated ceasefire between Israel and Hamas hit a critical impasse Sunday morning, as the terrorist organization failed to provide the required list of female hostages scheduled for release, IDF Spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said. Despite the passing of the designated start time, implementation of the ceasefire agreement remains suspended pending Hamas' compliance with this crucial prerequisite. 'Hamas continues to violate its commitments under the agreement,' Hagari emphasized, noting that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has explicitly directed that the ceasefire will not take effect until Israel receives the complete list of hostages to be freed. Hamas attributes the delay to 'technical reasons on the ground,' a claim that comes amid growing tension over the agreement's implementation. IDF Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari (Gideon Markowicz) Gideon Markowicz In a significant development parallel to the ceasefire negotiations, Hagari confirmed that a complex military operation has successfully recovered from Gaza the remains of Oron Shaul, who was killed and captured by Hamas in 2014 during Operation Protective Edge, and addressed the ongoing mission to recover the remains of Hadar Goldin – who too was killed and taken in the operation – confirming that security forces maintain their determined efforts for his return. 'While we all await the implementation of the hostage return agreement this morning, we must be clear that the ceasefire's implementation remains entirely contingent on Hamas fulfilling its obligations under the agreement,' Hagari said.

Arab world reacts to Gaza agreement	Arab reactions to the Gaza ceasefire and hostage agreement have revealed significant divisions across the region, with official statements carefully navigating diplomatic waters while individual voices challenge the Hamas terrorist organizations' victory claims. Responses have ranged from cautious diplomatic welcomes to outright rejection of Hamas' narrative. In a striking rebuke to regional sentiment, former Iraqi parliament member Faiq al-Sheikh Ali delivered a pointed critique on X: 'Arabs, Muslims, and Arab media – it's shameful and disgraceful to continue talking about Hamas' victory in Gaza. Hamas was severely defeated. As for Israel – it destroyed Hamas, devastated Gaza, killed its people, humiliated Iran, and removed it from the conflict equation. This is defeat by all criteria.' This stands in marked contrast to Iraq's pro-Iranian Shiite militias, which praised what they termed the 'Gaza support front.' The terrorist group's allies in Yemen, the Houthis, have maintained strategic ambiguity about their operations. Senior Houthi official Mohammad Abdul Salam offered a carefully worded statement: 'With the Gaza battle reaching its end with the ceasefire announcement, the Palestinian issue will remain the primary issue. Yemen entered the battle to support Gaza not as a show of force, but due to difficult circumstances.' The Iranian-backed group awaits guidance from their leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi regarding their missile and UAV launches against Israeli and international targets. Israelis rallying for the release of the hostages held by the Hamas terrorist organization in the Gaza Strip (Gideon Markowicz) Saudi Arabia's response typifies the measured approach taken by regional powers. While the Saudi Foreign Ministry welcomed the agreement, it coupled this with familiar demands regarding Israeli withdrawal 'from the Gaza Strip and other Palestinian and Arab territories.' The ministry's statement emphasized Palestinian statehood within 1967 borders with east Jerusalem as its capital, maintaining its traditional diplomatic position. Notably, Saudi social media has featured pointed criticism of Hamas' claims. Activists have circulated cartoons depicting Hamas spokesmen Abu Obeida and Osama Hamdan making victory signs while holding a corpse symbolizing Gaza, and another showing a Hamas official delivering a victory speech amid destruction. The Saudi newspaper ASharq Al-Awsat highlighted international aspects with its headline: 'Israel and Hamas welcomed Trump with hostage deal,' while Okaz declared: 'Gaza deal sees light.' Egypt's Al-Azhar institution maintained its support for terrorist organizations, stating: 'Al-Azhar expresses appreciation for the Palestinian people's steadfast stance, their loyalty to their homeland, and their resistance.' The religious body added: 'The souls of Gaza's martyrs will serve as inspiration for the continued Palestinian struggle until the full restoration of Palestinian rights.' Lebanese media framed the agreement through a local lens, with one outlet headlining: 'Gaza liberates itself from the Oct. 7 nightmare,' reflecting regional attempts to reshape the narrative around the terrorist attacks and subsequent war.

Hamas backtracks on hostage deal terms	According to an official statement from the Prime Minister's Office, Hamas is attempting to modify the ceasefire agreement terms after initial understandings were already reached. The terror organization demanded to strip Israel of its veto rights regarding the release of mass murderers and to independently dictate who would be released – a direct contradiction to the original agreement terms. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, conducting a conference call with the negotiating team stationed in Doha, firmly stated that Israel would not accept any alterations to the terms. 'We must maintain the agreements as previously established and reject Hamas' attempts at extortion,' the office's statement declared. Sources in Netanyahu's circle emphasized that Israel will not permit Hamas to impose new conditions at this crucial juncture, and the established understandings will remain unchanged. President-elect of the US, Donald Trump declares a deal has been reached. Photo credit: Gideon Markowitz This critical development emerged mere hours after Qatar's Prime Minister, President-elect Donald Trump, President Joe Biden, and Israeli President Isaac Herzog collectively announced a ceasefire and hostage release agreement. Netanyahu personally spoke with both the incoming and outgoing presidents, expressing gratitude for their roles in facilitating the agreement. However, it's significant to note that the Prime Minister's Office has yet to declare the agreement final, and had indeed indicated Wednesday evening that minor gaps still existed. In a related development, Mike Waltz, who served as National Security Advisor during the Trump administration, told Fox News that the President-elect's inauguration day would witness hostages reuniting with their families. A senior White House official disclosed to CNN that Sunday's release would include five female soldiers, alongside American citizens in the deal's initial phase. The official emphasized that should Hamas violate the agreement, the US would back the resumption of war and provide support. 'I want the Israelis to know this,' Waltz stated.

What's left of Hamas after 15 months of war?	With a ceasefire agreement and hostage release negotiations underway, attention turns to the current state of the Hamas terrorist organization in Gaza following approximately 15 months of war. As of Thursday, Israeli strikes have eliminated close to 20,000 terrorists from various organizations, decimating most of Hamas' senior leadership in Gaza. Despite these losses, the organization maintains control over humanitarian aid distribution and commands thousands of terrorists who now primarily operate as guerrilla fighters rather than an organized force. Before the war, Hamas commanded approximately 30,000 terrorists structured as a military force. According to Hamas sources, while eliminated commanders – including brigade and battalion leaders – have been replaced, these new leaders no longer maintain the same command and control structure. Gaza's civilian institutions descended into chaos, with no functioning judicial system. Hamas terrorists now impose impromptu street justice to intimidate opposition within the population. These forces periodically engage in armed confrontations with local groups attempting to gain control of humanitarian aid supplies. Hamas terrorists ride on top of a humanitarian aid truck in Rafah, Gaza Strip, Dec. 19, 2023. Photo credit: AP A police force numbering several thousand focuses primarily on controlling humanitarian aid distribution. Currently, there is no effective control over Gaza Strip borders, including the Egyptian one. Under the proposed agreement, withdrawal from the Philadelphi Corridor would commence only after the release of all 33 hostages in the first phase, concluding on day 50 of the ceasefire – during either the second phase or its negotiation period. Beyond the police force and the terrorists, Hamas also maintains control over a civilian emergency services system under its direct command. Current status of senior terrorist organization leadership Political leadership: The head of the Political Bureau Yahya Sinwar and Government head Rawhi Mushtaha are dead, as well as seven bureau members. Six bureau members escaped abroad before the war. Four bureau members remain alive: Mahmoud al-Zahar, an education official, the head of women's affairs, and another relatively minor figure. Hamas police chief, his deputy, and several station commanders are dead, as well as Hamas' head of the Legislative Council. The head of the internal security apparatus Tawfiq Abu Naim remains alive. Military leadership: Military wing commander Mohammed Deif and deputy wing commander Marwan Issa are dead. However, Southern Gaza commander Mohammed Sinwar, who was recently 'promoted' as Hamas' de facto leader, is alive. Northern Gaza commander Ahmed Ghandour, Central Gaza commander Ayman Nofal, and his replacement are dead, along with Khan Younis brigade commander Rafa Salameh. Gaza brigade commander Izz al-Din Haddad who was 'promoted' is alive, and so is Rafah brigade commander Mohammed Shabaneh. Chief of Operations Staff Raad Saad's fate remains unknown, while the Head of Intelligence Staff Mohammed Khamis Dababesh is dead.

Two-state solution all but dismissed by Trump confidant	A senior figure within US President-elect Donald Trump's innermost circle has recently said that the establishment of a Palestinian state was not under consideration. The source, who belongs to Trump's and his family's closest orbit of confidants and has carried numerous crucial assignments for him previously, made these comments during recent private conversations at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. The senior Trump-world persona offered no explanation for this position, simply stating that 'it's clear this won't happen.' Notably, Trump in December spoke about what kind of Mideast peace he would back. 'I support whatever solution we can do to get peace. There are other ideas other than two-state, but I support whatever is necessary to get not just peace, [but] a lasting peace. It can't go on where every five years you end up in tragedy. There are other alternatives,' he said at the time. On Tuesday, Mar-a-Lago hosted a Jerusalem Prayer Breakfast conference, bringing together Christian and Jewish participants as part of the effort to bolster Israel-US relations. American and Israeli speakers uniformly expressed firm opposition to both the establishment of a Palestinian state and any Israeli withdrawal from Judea and Samaria. They emphasized that both religious and security considerations make it imperative for Israel to maintain its presence in these territories. The settlement of Ma'ale Efrayim in Samaria (AP / Oded Balilty) In a related development, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar, during his visit to Italy on Monday, addressed the ongoing discussion about a 'Palestinian state,' stating that 'the two-state solution is a slogan and an illusion.

Erdogan warns Israel against 'aggressive actions' in Syria	Turkey's president has issued threats against Israel regarding its operations in Syria, Yeni Safak reported Wednesday, marking another diplomatic confrontation between Ankara and Jerusalem. In a combative address to his party, Recep Tayyip Erdogan demanded Israel cease what he termed 'aggressive actions' in Syria, warning of 'negative consequences.' 'Starting with Israel, the forces attacking Syrian territories must immediately put an end to their aggressive actions. Otherwise, the consequences will have a negative impact on everyone,' he said. Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip (IDF Spokesperson's Unit) IDF Spokesperson's Unit With regard to the war with Hamas, Erdogan continued his hostile rhetoric toward Israel. 'With the establishment of a ceasefire in Gaza, where genocide and massacres have been ongoing for 15 months, an important opportunity will arise for lasting peace and stability across the entire region. We are closely following the ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas, and we hope to receive positive news as soon as possible.' The statements come as Syria's transition government under Prime Minister Ahmed al-Sharaa seeks international support for reconstruction efforts. Turkey has positioned itself as a key supporter of the new Syrian administration. While claiming to support Kurdish rights, Erdogan maintained his hardline stance against Kurdish autonomous regions. 'We are followers and supporters of the solution to all the issues of our Kurdish brothers, just like every other group in Syria, and we are the guarantor of the security of the Kurds,' he said.

Pager-style? Iran claims Israel 'rigged' nuclear centrifuges	Iranian officials discovered explosives embedded in equipment purchased for the country's nuclear program, Iran International reported Wednesday, citing claims by Vice President Mohammad Javad Zarif. 'Our colleagues had purchased a centrifuge platform for the Atomic Energy Organization, and it was discovered that explosives had been embedded inside it, which they managed to detect,' Zarif said, according to Iran International. The timeline of the alleged incident remains unclear, Iran International reported. The revelation follows a series of security incidents targeting Iran's nuclear facilities, including a power failure at the Natanz uranium enrichment site in April 2021. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei speaks during a meeting at the IRGC Aerospace Force achievements exhibition in Tehran, Iran November 19, 2023 (Reuters / West Asia News Agency) According to Iran International, Zarif detailed how international sanctions have forced Iran and its allies to rely on intermediaries for equipment purchases, creating security vulnerabilities. 'Instead of being able to order equipment directly from the manufacturer, sanctions force you to rely on multiple intermediaries for such purchases,' Zarif said, according to the report. 'If the Zionist regime infiltrates even one of the intermediaries, they can do anything and embed anything they want, which is exactly what happened,' Zarif said, Iran International reported. The Iranian official linked these vulnerabilities to a series of explosions in Hezbollah's communication devices in September 2024, the report said. According to Iran International, these incidents resulted in 32 deaths and more than 3,000 injuries when approximately 5,000 pagers and 1,000 walkie-talkies detonated. In response to these incidents, Iran International reported that Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps suspended the use of communication devices and initiated inspections. The Iranian Civil Aviation Organization implemented a ban on electronic communication devices, including mobile phones, on commercial flights. 'These are, in fact, some of the damages caused by sanctions, which have made circumventing them a necessity for us,' Zarif said, according to Iran International. 'In addition to financial losses, there have also been significant security risks.' The post Pager-style?

Talks remain intensive': Hostage deal negotiation in Doha persis...	The Hostages and Missing Families Forum provided an update to families on Tuesday evening regarding a high-level situation assessment that included Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his team, Defense Minister Israel Katz, senior security officials, and the negotiating team stationed in Doha. According to the message, 'Throughout recent hours, intensive consultations and situation assessments continued at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, alongside comprehensive comprehensive interagency coordination necessitated by the current state of negotiations. The talks remain intensive, focusing on details requiring resolution, and will continue throughout the night.' Saudi media reported that Hamas requested several additional hours to examine specific clauses within the ceasefire agreement before delivering their final response. The Saudi news channel AlHadath cited a senior Israeli source stating that the Hamas delay is not related to any issues regarding the transfer of troop withdrawal maps. In a parallel development, White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan expressed optimism, stating he 'hopes to close the hostage deal this week.' A source familiar with the negotiations revealed to the Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that Hamas had submitted its 'agreement' to the draft proposal on Monday night. However, the organization simultaneously requested detailed maps from mediators specifying the areas designated for IDF withdrawal, along with precise timetables for each phase of the withdrawal process. The source explained that 'Hamas fears Israel might avoid implementing the gradual withdrawal unless mediators possess clear, referenceable maps that can be consulted in the event of any Israeli violations.'

'These are, in fact, some of the damages caused by sanctions, which have made circumventing them a necessity for us,' Zarif said, according to Iran International. 'In addition to financial losses, there have also been significant security risks.' The post Pager-style?

X's new sister? Musk could take over US' TikTok	Chinese government officials are exploring the possibility of Elon Musk acquiring TikTok's US operations if the platform cannot prevent an impending ban, Bloomberg reported Tuesday, citing people familiar with the discussions. While Beijing officials strongly prefer ByteDance Ltd. to maintain ownership of TikTok, Bloomberg reported, they have begun evaluating backup options as part of broader discussions about working with President-elect Donald Trump's administration. 'In my opinion, TikTok should not be banned in the USA, even though such a ban may benefit the X platform,' Musk wrote on X, Bloomberg reported. 'Doing so would be contrary to freedom of speech and expression. It is not what America stands for.' One scenario under consideration involves Musk's X platform taking control of TikTok's US operations, which would combine the platforms' operations, Bloomberg reported. TikTok's US user base of more than 170 million could potentially boost X's advertising appeal. Elon Musk walks on Capitol Hill on December 5, 2024 (Reuters/Benoit Tessier) Reuters Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun declined to comment during a Tuesday press briefing, directing reporters to Beijing's previous statements. 'We can't be expected to comment on pure fiction,' a ByteDance representative said, according to Bloomberg. The Chinese government maintains influence through a 'golden share' in a ByteDance affiliate, though TikTok maintains this only applies to the China-based subsidiary Douyin Information Service Co., Bloomberg reported. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Mandeep Singh and Damian Reimertz estimated TikTok's US operations could be valued at $40 billion–$50 billion. The transaction's feasibility remains unclear, as Musk is still paying off loans from his $44 billion Twitter acquisition in 2022.

President-elect Trump, who takes office January 20, has sought to delay the January 19 ban to continue negotiations, expressing his desire to 'save' the application. Alternative outlets exploring potential TikTok acquisition include a bid from billionaire Frank McCourt and 'Shark Tank' investor Kevin O'Leary through Project Liberty, while Microsoft Corp. previously sought to acquire the business, and Oracle Corp. maintains a technology partnership with the company, Bloomberg reported.

Israel concessions 'neither end war nor compromise achievements'	The IDF is preparing to implement a potential hostage deal, including force redeployment during the ceasefire and aid deliveries, contingent on Hamas' approval in intensive Qatar negotiations that progressed on Sunday. The talks, featuring Mossad Chief David Barnea, Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar, and retired Major General Nitzan Alon, focus on a phased agreement framework. According to foreign reports, the first phase involves Israel's demand for the return of 33 hostages, as reported by the BBC last week, in exchange for a 42-day ceasefire. In discussions with Israel Hayom, a senior security official emphasized that Israel remains firm on not committing to war termination within the deal's framework. 'The current deal structure preserves our ability to resume military operations,' the source stated. The official highlighted Israel's unwavering stance on maintaining an Israeli presence along the Philadelphi Corridor during the ceasefire – both positions previously rejected by Hamas. A diplomatic source acknowledged progress in Qatar discussions while noting remaining gaps. 'The concessions we're considering neither end the war nor compromise its achievements,' the official concluded. This stance underlies political assessments suggesting both Religious Zionism Chairman Bezalel Smotrich and Otzma Yehudit leader Itamar Ben-Gvir will ultimately endorse the emerging agreement. The deal faces challenges in both Qatar and Jerusalem regarding prisoners who will be released, IDF withdrawal from the Netzarim Corridor throughout the ceasefire, and the relocation of serious offenders to foreign countries. Mossad Chief David Barnea and Qatari Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al-Thani (Gideon Markowicz / Salim MATRAMKOT / AFP) Qatar discussions also address establishing a screening mechanism for northern Gaza returns, with Israel transferring screening authority to a foreign entity instead of the IDF. Another key focus is securing commitment to continue negotiations for the second phase – complete hostage return – beginning in the third week of the first phase's implementation. Regarding military positioning during the ceasefire, foreign reports indicate Israel's agreement to maintain partial presence in the Philadelphi Corridor, withdraw from the Netzarim Corridor, and position forces around Gaza's perimeter. Concurrent with Qatar negotiations, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu initiated individual meetings with potential opposition to the proposed framework. Despite having secured majority support in the governing coalition, Netanyahu seeks to maintain government unity. This motivated his separate evening consultations with Ben-Gvir and Smotrich to reaffirm deal red lines designed to preserve coalition stability regardless of voting positions.

Israel's strike on Houthis accidentally showcases Saudi megaproje...	In footage released Sunday by the IDF spokesperson documenting strikes against Houthi terror targets in Yemen Friday, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's ambitious megaproject 'The Line' – a cornerstone of Saudi Arabia's future vision – appears prominently alongside an Israeli Air Force Ram 707 refueling aircraft. The endeavor appears to be an unprecedented feat of engineering on a global scale: a futuristic metropolis extending 170 kilometers (106 miles) and soaring 500 meters (1,640 feet) above the desert landscape of Ras al-Sheikh Hamid. The planned linear city, with its slender width of 200 meters (656 feet), will feature a striking exterior completely clad in light-reflecting glass, designed to mirror the surrounding desert vistas. The structure will span from the mountainous NEOM region to the shores of the Red Sea. Saudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman meets US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, not pictured, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Wednesday, March 20, 2024 (AP/Evelyn Hockstein) The project eschews conventional urban infrastructure in favor of a sophisticated underground transportation network, linking numerous residential, commercial, workplace, and leisure facilities along its length. Saudi planners project the creation of approximately half a million employment opportunities, with an estimated $50 billion contribution to the national GDP. Emphasizing environmental sustainability, the development will operate entirely on renewable energy sources while maintaining 95% of its surroundings as pristine natural space. The city's design accommodates roughly 9 million inhabitants, with a carefully planned layout ensuring all essential services remain within a 5-minute walk. A state-of-the-art high-speed rail system will enable residents to traverse the entire length of the city in just 20 minutes. Construction commenced with initial excavation work in October 2021, with project completion targeted for 2045.

Abbas' son to pay Israeli researcher after suing for NIS 500,000	The Jerusalem District Court rejected today (Sunday) an appeal by Tareq Abbas, son of Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), in a defamation lawsuit against Middle East expert Dr. Reuven Berko. Abbas, who sought damages of NIS 500,000 ($141,000) regarding a television interview given by Berko, will now be required to pay legal expenses of NIS 20,000 ($5,640). The case centered on an Arabic language interview where Dr. Berko discussed Tareq Abbas' business activities. Berko asserted that he owns multiple companies and characterized the Abbas family as 'full of money.' He further stated that 'without security coordination, their presence in the Authority's territory would be short-lived,' and claimed that Abbas' family members 'arrived here with nothing and became millionaires.' In a detailed verdict, Judge Ram Winograd, Vice President of the District Court, found that the lawsuit relied solely on edited portions of the original interview, downloaded from a Gaza news site. 'The alteration of how statements were made, and potentially their sequence and substance, prevents the court from evaluating the publication as a whole,' the judge wrote. Dr. Reuven Berko A crucial aspect of the ruling addressed Tareq Abbas' allegation that the statements portrayed him as collaborating with Israel. The court firmly rejected this claim, stating that Israeli courts do not consider statements about cooperation with Israel as defamatory. Judge Winograd stated: 'This claim cannot be sustained as an Israeli court cannot view such expressions as defamation.' The proceedings revealed that contrary to Abbas' initial assertion, the interview was not aired on an Israeli channel but was distributed through a Gaza news site. Berko maintained that in the complete interview, he had actually commended the Abbas family, and his statements were presented without proper context. Judges Shoshana Leibowitz and Tamar Bar-Asher concurred with Judge Winograd's decision. Attorney Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, president of the 'Shurat HaDin' organization representing Berko, commented: 'This is another failed attempt at silencing by Abu Mazen's [Mahmoud Abbas] son. Let all those who wish us harm and try to intimidate our rights, especially in these days, know that justice is on our side, and it will ultimately come to light.'

Israel seizes billions in shock PA debt maneuver	The Finance Ministry has offset all electricity debts of the Palestinian Authority – 1.1 billion shekels ($310 million) – while simultaneously emptying the Norwegian fund where Palestinian Authority-destined funds had been deposited since the start of the war. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich led this initiative throughout the past year and on Sunday told the Diplomatic-Security Cabinet the completion of the process – collecting the entire debt that had stood 1.9 billion shekels ($515 million) for over a decade. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Oren Ben-Hakoon) Additionally, and no less significantly, the Finance Ministry on Sunday issued an order to the Norwegian fund, where Israel had deposited millions deducted from PA funds earmarked for the Gaza Strip (275 million shekels monthly or $74 million), totaling some 1.4 billion shekels accumulated until May ($379 million). This money will cover PA debts to Israeli companies: Half will go to companies that supplied fuel to the Palestinian Authority and half to the Israel Electric Corporation. Since last May, when Norway announced its unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state, Minister Smotrich also stopped transferring the offset funds to the Norwegian fund and began accumulating the amount separately in Israel. Now, the sum that was supposedly meant to return to the PA after the war from both the fund and Israel is being transferred to cover debts to the Israel Electric Corporation in coordination with the US. The behind-the-scenes negotiations on this matter with the PA and various American entities were led by Finance Ministry deputy director-general. The latter succeeded where his predecessors failed: transferring the money in full, without reducing late payment interest, from PA funds to the Israel Electric Corporation. The PA's debt to the Israel Electric Corporation has been an ongoing issue for Israel for 15 years. Former Finance Ministry Director-General Shai Babad reached two agreements in 2016 and 2020 with the PA to settle the rolling debt, but these were repeatedly violated by the Authority. As we reported in September 2023, Smotrich, in his role as finance minister, began reducing the rolling debt by associating the Jerusalem District Electricity Company with the PA , thus stopping the debt from growing every two months and fixing it at 1.9 billion shekels. Since then, in July and November of last year, a total of approximately 700 million shekels were collected from the Authority. Today, this historic collection process reached its peak and conclusion – 1.1 billion shekels will be cleared in full and the money will be transferred to the Israel Electric Corporation, partly from the Norwegian fund and partly from funds accumulated in Israel. After reaching agreements with US Ambassador Thomas Nides and preventing the use of accumulated funds in the Norwegian fund for Palestinian purposes, Norway will receive a letter requesting the funds from the Accountant General, from there to pay various debts. Despite American demands for interest rate discounts, the Finance Ministry refused to compromise even one shekel, understanding that such 'discounts' are a negative incentive that no Israeli citizen receives. A deadline was also set for the first time with the Americans: transferring the budget in Israel without indirectly rolling additional burdens onto citizens due to the debt held by the Israel Electric Corporation. The fact that the Biden administration boycotted the Israeli finance minister played in favor of the matter, as the absence of relations meant the absence of obligation to respond to their demands on Palestinian issues. The diplomatic gain means that the Palestinian Authority was indirectly forced to pay the debt it had been rolling over year after year. This is also a significant economic event as the PA's debt to the Israel Electric Corporation led to loans and high interest rates as well as damage to the Israel Electric Corporation's credit rating, which ultimately rolled over to citizens.

Biden signals major progress in hostage negotiations	President Joe Biden delivered a promising update on the hostage deal negotiations between Israel and Hamas and the Gaza ceasefire discussions overnight (between Thursday and Friday), declaring that 'real progress' has been achieved, with the possibility of completion before Jan. 20. The outgoing president revealed he had met earlier with key negotiators while identifying Hamas as the current obstacle to finalizing the deal. Despite the challenge, Biden maintained his optimistic outlook, emphasizing that he believes 'we should be able to reach an agreement.' In a separate diplomatic development, Biden mentioned his conversation with Lebanon's new president, Joseph Aoun, whom he praised as 'the right leader' for the country. US President Joe Biden (EPA/Jim Watson) In a parallel development, families of the hostages convened Thursday with Gal Hirsch, the Prime Minister's Office coordinator for captives and missing persons. During the meeting, Hirsch assured family representatives that despite its phased implementation, the agreement under discussion in Qatar encompasses all hostages. He further emphasized the ongoing coordination with both the outgoing and incoming US administrations to ensure seamless continuity as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to assume office. The diplomatic momentum continued as President Isaac Herzog met with Cyprus President Nikos Christodoulides in Nicosia Thursday, where discussions included the international community's efforts to secure the hostages' return.

Report: US, UK, Israel conduct joint strikes in Yemen	Arab media outlets reported an unprecedented military operation Friday, marking the first coordinated strikes by US, British, and Israeli forces since the escalation of regional hostilities. According to international sources, the operation comprised three waves of strikes targeting critical infrastructure across Houthi-controlled territories. The operation, totaling approximately 30 strikes, focused on several strategic locations: underground military installations in the Amran governorate, military complexes in Sanaa, a power generation facility south of the capital, and the strategic western ports of Al-Hudaydah and Ras Issa. Hamas terrorists take part in an anti-Israel rally in the Gaza Strip, May 22, 2021 (Reuters/Mohammed Salem) A mass pro-Hamas demonstration took place in Sanaa concurrent with the military operation. Participants rallied behind the Shia-Zaidi terror movement's ideological slogan, chanting 'Death to America, Death to Israel, Curse upon the Jews, Victory for Islam.'

Army chief walking a tight rope: Meet Lebanon's leading president...	Lebanese Army Commander Joseph Aoun has emerged as the leading contender for Lebanon's presidency, with opposition factions coalescing around his candidacy in a rare show of consensus. The decisive parliamentary session, scheduled for Thursday, comes as Aoun has secured support from 74 of 128 parliament members. The path to presidency, however, faces a constitutional hurdle. As a general, Aoun must overcome a mandatory two-year 'cooling period,' requiring 86 votes for a constitutional amendment. To bridge this gap, he needs either partial support from the Amal-Hezbollah alliance (31 votes) or backing from the Free Patriotic Movement (13 votes). Video: Compilation footage of the Beirut explosion A significant breakthrough came with the withdrawal of Suleiman Frangieh, Hezbollah's initial candidate from the Marada Movement party. While Frangieh's party holds only two seats, his endorsement of Aoun signals a potential shift in Hezbollah's stance. Sky News reports an agreement between Hezbollah and Amal to support Aoun, though no official announcement has been made. Born in 1964 in San Fil, Mount Lebanon governorate, Aoun's military career began in 1983 when he joined the Lebanese Army as a cadet. His rise to army commander in 2017 was marked by extensive military education, including counter-terrorism training in the US. Early in his command, he successfully led operations against ISIS in the eastern Bekaa Valley. Aoun's leadership style emerged clearly during Lebanon's cascading crises, including the 2020 Beirut port explosion. He maintained neutrality while navigating relationships with Hezbollah, protesters, the US, and Arab nations. This approach, while earning broad support, drew criticism from the Free Patriotic Movement during protests against then-President Michel Aoun. Beyond his military credentials, Aoun holds bachelor's degrees in political science and military science. Fluent in Arabic, English, and French, he is known in Lebanese media as an intellectual who often quotes Sun Tzu's 'The Art of War.' His diplomatic skills and strategic mindset have become hallmarks of his leadership approach.	https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/01/09/army-chief-walking-a-tight-rope-meet-lebanons-leading-presidential-candidate/	2025-01-08T22:20:38-08:00
