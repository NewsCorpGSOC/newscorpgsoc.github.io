Breaking: Hezbollah Confirms Death of Muhammad Srour	Hezbollah has announced the death of one of its commanders, Muhammad Hussein Srour, on Thursday. The group did not provide details about how he died but mentioned in a statement that Srour was killed 'on the road to Jerusalem,' a term used to describe those fighting in support of Gaza. Earlier the same day, the Israeli military claimed responsibility for an airstrike in the southern suburbs of Beirut that resulted in Srour's death. They identified him as the leader of Hezbollah’s Aerial Command. According to the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the operation to target Srour was authorized while Netanyahu was en route to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly.The post Breaking: Hezbollah Confirms Death of Muhammad Srour first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-death-muhammad-srour/	2024-09-27T00:43:22-07:00

Breaking: Israel Hid Explosives in Pagers Sold to Hezbollah, Clai...	Israel carried out sophisticated attacks against Hezbollah by secretly rigging pagers with explosives, Lebanese security officials revealed. These attacks, which targeted communications devices like pagers and walkie-talkies, resulted in at least 37 deaths and nearly 3,000 injuries, affecting many civilians. On September 17, Lebanese officials conducted controlled detonations of these weaponized pagers, which were off during the initial attack and hence did not explode. This demonstration showcased the potential devastation of the blasts on those carrying the devices. Despite Israel not openly admitting to these attacks, sources indicate that the operation was a collaboration between Mossad and the Israeli military, as hinted by Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in his praise for the security forces’ joint achievements. The explosive materials were ingeniously hidden inside the pager batteries, making them undetectable. Lebanese security sources highlighted the sophistication of the technology used, noting the explosives were discreetly integrated within the pagers' lithium batteries. Experts explained that these improvised explosive devices (IEDs) required minimal additional components due to the existing parts in the pagers, such as the power source and the casing. Modifications likely involved embedding a small explosive charge and an electronic detonator directly into the battery. Further investigations traced the pagers back to a model produced by the Taiwanese company Gold Apollo, under dubious circumstances involving shell companies and possibly involving Hungarian and Bulgarian entities, to obscure the operation's origins. Taiwanese and Hungarian authorities are investigating the supply chain links, with no conclusive evidence yet found to pinpoint the exact source or pathway of these modified pagers. Meanwhile, Hezbollah's leadership has initiated their own investigations to determine the exact sequence of events leading to the attack, vowing consequences for those responsible.The post Breaking: Israel Hid Explosives in Pagers Sold to Hezbollah, Claim Lebanese Officials first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-explosives-pagers-sold-hezbollah/	2024-09-27T00:42:00-07:00	
Mikati: Ceasefire Deal Hinges on Netanyahu	Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati stated that he has taken 'all necessary actions to safeguard Lebanon' amid increasing tensions with Israel, highlighting that both foreign and Arab nations have backed Lebanon's position. Mikati expressed concerns about the practical application of peace efforts, particularly questioning Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's willingness to adhere to a statement made by the U.S. and France. He noted that Netanyahu had previously dismissed several peace overtures proposed by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the United Nations Security Council, and various Arab entities, according to the Mustaqbal Web news portal. Mikati emphasized, 'We have fulfilled our responsibilities; however, the outcome is beyond our control.'The post Mikati: Ceasefire Deal Hinges on Netanyahu first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/mikati-ceasefire-deal-hinges-netanyahu/	2024-09-27T00:41:41-07:00

Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, a close associate of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, conveyed to U.S. mediator Amos Hochstein in New York that Israel will persist in its military actions in Lebanon and rejects the current ceasefire proposals, according to an Arab diplomat. Despite Israel's stance, there is ongoing diplomacy involving the U.S., Qatar, France, and Turkey. These nations are engaged in discussions, and mediators remain hopeful about finding a resolution, the diplomat revealed to LBCI television. The diplomatic efforts include planned talks between the French and Americans with Netanyahu, while Qatari and Turkish officials are set to meet with Iranian representatives, the diplomat further stated.The post US and France to Press Netanyahu After Dermer Rejects Lebanon Truce Proposals first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-france-press-netanyahu-dermer-rejects-lebanon-truce/	2024-09-27T00:41:21-07:00	
Netanyahu Vows to Strike Hezbollah Until All Goals Are Met	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Thursday that Israel will persist in its aggressive operations against Hezbollah, emphasizing that the strikes will continue unabated until all objectives are met, including the secure return of northern residents to their homes. This declaration came as he arrived in New York for the U.N. General Assembly amidst efforts by the U.S. and Europe to instigate a 21-day ceasefire for peace talks. Prior to this, the Israeli military reported an operation targeting a Hezbollah drone commander in Beirut's southern suburbs. Netanyahu’s firm stance diminishes the prospects of an impending ceasefire, with Israel intensifying its military actions in Lebanon over the past week, citing direct responses to over 11 months of cross-border attacks by Hezbollah. The international community's call for a ceasefire aims to curb the severe hostilities that have already resulted in significant casualties in Lebanon and heightened the risk of a full-scale war. Israel is also considering a ground invasion to displace Hezbollah forces from proximate border areas. While Hezbollah has yet to formally respond to the ceasefire suggestion, Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati has endorsed it, highlighting the regional desire for peace. However, Hezbollah remains steadfast, conditioning any cessation of hostilities on a ceasefire in Gaza, where Israel has been engaged with Hamas for nearly a year. Amidst these tensions, Netanyahu affirmed the continuation of the Gaza operations until all military goals are achieved. His statements coincide with potential political instability within his government, as far-right coalition partners threaten withdrawal support should a ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah materialize, potentially jeopardizing his majority in parliament.The post Netanyahu Vows to Strike Hezbollah Until All Goals Are Met first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/netanyahu-strike-hezbollah-all-goals-met/	2024-09-27T00:40:57-07:00	
Britain Sends Humanitarian Aid to Civilians in Lebanon	Britain has announced it will provide $6.7 million in humanitarian aid to Lebanon, aimed at helping civilians affected by ongoing conflicts that have forced thousands to flee their homes. The aid package includes medical supplies, hygiene kits, and fuel, with the distribution of these resources to be managed by UNICEF. This support is intended to assist aid workers in addressing critical health and nutrition needs within the civilian population. In anticipation of potential escalations in the region's conflict, the UK has also prepared for the possible evacuation of British nationals. To this end, 700 military personnel, including members from the Border Force and the Foreign Office, have been stationed at a British military base in Cyprus. Additionally, an online portal and a dedicated phone line have been reactivated to help British citizens in Lebanon register their presence and receive assistance. Cyprus, located about 210 kilometers west of Beirut, previously served as a transit point for around 60,000 foreign nationals evacuated from Lebanon during the 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. Anneliese Dodds, Britain's Minister of State for Development, Women and Equalities, affirmed the UK's ongoing commitment to support the Lebanese people and encouraged British nationals to depart from Lebanon. Moreover, the British navy has positioned the RFA Mounts Bay and HMS Duncan in the eastern Mediterranean, and the Royal Air Force has aircraft and transport helicopters ready to provide additional support as necessary.The post Britain Sends Humanitarian Aid to Civilians in Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/britain-humanitarian-aid-civilians-lebanon/	2024-09-26T05:11:36-07:00	
US and Allies Push for 21-Day Ceasefire in Lebanon	On Wednesday, the United States, France, and other allies called for an urgent 21-day ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. This appeal, crafted during discussions at the U.N. General Assembly in New York, aims to halt the recent violence that has claimed over 600 lives in Lebanon. The joint statement described the ongoing conflict as intolerable and warned of the risk it poses for broader regional escalation. The call for a ceasefire seeks to create a window for diplomatic negotiations, urging all involved parties, including the governments of Israel and Lebanon, to agree to the ceasefire without delay. Despite the appeal, there was no immediate response from the Israeli or Lebanese governments or from Hezbollah. Senior U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, mentioned that while Hezbollah itself wouldn't sign the ceasefire, they anticipate that the Lebanese government would agree to it in coordination with Hezbollah. These officials also expect a positive reception from Israel, particularly when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addresses the General Assembly. This ceasefire initiative is part of broader efforts to stabilize the region, which has seen months of escalating exchanges of fire, displacing tens of thousands and stoking fears of a larger conflict. The proposal also aims to rejuvenate stalled talks for a ceasefire and hostage release between Israel and Hamas, indicating a complex intertwining of regional conflicts. The ceasefire proposal was a result of rapid diplomatic efforts led by President Joe Biden's security team, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. These efforts included securing endorsements from various global leaders and aligning international support for a pause in fighting, which could potentially lead to more permanent solutions. Notably, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot and Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati have publicly supported the ceasefire, urging quick acceptance to prevent further escalation. Conversely, Israel's U.N. Ambassador, Danny Danon, expressed a preference for a ceasefire to facilitate the return of residents near the border, emphasizing that Israel does not desire a full-scale war. The Security Council resolution that ended the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah was also reaffirmed by both Danon and Mikati. This resolution, which has not been fully implemented, includes provisions for a cessation of hostilities and the disarmament of armed groups in Lebanon, including Hezbollah. President Biden, speaking on 'The View,' mentioned that while an all-out war remains a possibility, there is also a chance for a significant diplomatic resolution that could transform the regional dynamics, underscoring his administration's commitment to finding a peaceful solution. Additionally, the U.S. has intensified its pressure on entities supporting Hezbollah through sanctions targeting illicit Iranian petroleum shipments, demonstrating the multifaceted approach the U.S. is employing to address the complex issues in the Middle East.The post US and Allies Push for 21-Day Ceasefire in Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-allies-push-21-day-ceasefire-lebanon/	2024-09-26T05:11:26-07:00	
Hezbollah Strikes Israeli Defense Complexes Near Haifa Again	On Thursday, the Israeli military reported conducting airstrikes on approximately 75 Hezbollah-associated sites in Lebanon throughout the night. These targets included the group's ammunition storage facilities and rocket launchers, as well as various other militant resources located in the Bekaa region and southern Lebanon. Simultaneously, Israel detected 45 projectiles launched from Lebanon, with some being intercepted by Israeli defenses and the others landing in unpopulated areas. Israeli aircraft continued their operations in southern Lebanon in response. Hezbollah confirmed it had attacked the Rafael military industry complexes near Haifa in northern Israel, targeting the site with multiple rockets. This attack was part of Hezbollah's ongoing campaign, which it says defends Lebanon and its people. On the previous day, Israeli airstrikes resulted in 72 fatalities across Lebanon. Breakdowns from the Lebanese ministry indicated that 38 deaths occurred in southern Lebanon, 12 in the eastern Bekaa area, and 22 across three towns both north and south of Beirut. These strikes also left nearly 400 people wounded. Over the last three days, the Israeli military has targeted over 2,000 Hezbollah sites in Lebanon, including several hundred sites hit on Wednesday alone.The post Hezbollah Strikes Israeli Defense Complexes Near Haifa Again first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-strikes-israeli-defense-complexes-haifa/	2024-09-26T05:11:10-07:00

Israeli Strike Kills 23 Syrian Workers Near Baalbek	On Thursday, Lebanon's state-run news agency reported that an Israeli airstrike targeted a building in northeastern Lebanon, near Baalbek in the eastern Bekaa Valley, killing 23 Syrian workers and injuring eight others. The airstrike occurred late Wednesday and impacted a region close to the Syrian border. The mayor of Younine, Ali Kassas, confirmed that the victims included 23 Syrians found in the debris, alongside four injured Syrians and four Lebanese nationals. Local official Hussein Salloum noted that the casualties primarily included women and children, and described the community's efforts to rescue survivors, which continued into Thursday morning with limited resources until additional help, such as a bulldozer, arrived. The Lebanese Red Cross and other groups, including Hezbollah's paramedic service and the Lebanese Civil Defense, were involved in recovery operations. This strike is part of a series of intense Israeli bombings targeting Hezbollah locations in Lebanon, which have also responded with rocket fire into Israel. The conflict has resulted in over 630 deaths on the Lebanese side, including a significant number of women and children, as reported by local health officials. Meanwhile, in Israel, several have been injured by shrapnel. Lebanon, home to about 6 million people, is also host to nearly 780,000 registered Syrian refugees, plus hundreds of thousands unregistered, making it the country with the highest refugee population per capita worldwide.The post Israeli Strike Kills 23 Syrian Workers Near Baalbek first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-kills-23-syrian-workers-baalbek/	2024-09-26T05:10:34-07:00

On Thursday, the Israeli military announced that its air force had conducted strikes on facilities located at the Syria-Lebanon border. These facilities were reportedly used by Hezbollah for transporting weapons from Syria into Lebanon. The military stated that these arms were then employed by Hezbollah in attacks against Israeli civilians. The strikes come amidst ongoing cross-border hostilities and increasing international demands for a ceasefire.The post Israeli Army Strikes Hezbollah Infrastructure on Syria-Lebanon Border first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strikes-hezbollah-infrastructure-syria-lebanon-border/	2024-09-26T04:41:24-07:00	
Conflicting Reports Emerge on Israel-Lebanon Ceasefire Talks	According to sources close to negotiations taking place in New York, there is significant progress toward reaching a ceasefire agreement between Lebanon and Israel, as reported by Lebanon's MTV. Meanwhile, an Arab diplomat spoke to LBCI television, stating that the Israeli representative at the U.N. had expressed strong reservations about a U.S. ceasefire proposal and confirmed that military operations in Lebanon would continue. The same diplomat mentioned that envoys interacting with Hezbollah received ambiguous responses, with Hezbollah tying any resolution to an agreement with Hamas, who has yet to approve the proposal’s language. Additionally, officials from the U.S., France, Qatar, and Egypt plan to meet soon to consider adjustments to the proposed ceasefire. In a joint statement, these nations, along with other international and regional allies, called for an immediate 21-day ceasefire along the Lebanon-Israel border to facilitate diplomatic efforts. Israeli media reported that a ceasefire could take effect within hours. Despite reports that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had instructed the military to reduce its operations in Lebanon due to the ongoing negotiations, his office later denied these claims, stating that Netanyahu had not yet responded to the ceasefire proposal. Furthermore, Qatar clarified that the negotiations for a ceasefire in Gaza are not directly linked to the international efforts for a ceasefire in Lebanon. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, known for his firm stance, declared on social media that Israel would not agree to a ceasefire and would continue its military actions against Hezbollah 'until victory' and until residents can safely return to northern Israel.The post Conflicting Reports Emerge on Israel-Lebanon Ceasefire Talks first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/conflicting-reports-israel-lebanon-talks/	2024-09-26T04:41:04-07:00	
Israel Vows to Fight Hezbollah 'Until Victory'	On Thursday, Israel firmly dismissed a proposal, primarily supported by the United States, for a 21-day ceasefire with Lebanon. Israel affirmed its commitment to continue its military actions against Hezbollah militants until it achieves victory. Israeli forces have been conducting heavy aerial attacks on Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon, resulting in numerous casualties, while Hezbollah has retaliated with rocket fire. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz stated on the social media platform X that Israel would not cease its military efforts in the north, aiming for a decisive victory and the secure return of northern residents to their homes. Shortly before this, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu clarified that he hadn't responded to the ceasefire suggestion and instructed the military to persist with their operations at full strength. This stance came as the United States, France, and other international allies called for a three-week halt to hostilities. This appeal was made during meetings held on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, stating that the ongoing conflict was detrimental to both Lebanese and Israeli interests. On the ground, the conflict showed no signs of abating. The Israeli military targeted around 75 Hezbollah positions in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley and the south, areas that have witnessed significant civilian displacement recently. An airstrike near Baalbek resulted in at least nine fatalities, and the intensity of the attacks led local residents to describe the experience as one of the worst nights of their lives. Amidst these developments, the possibility of an Israeli ground offensive looms, with Israel's military chief instructing preparations for such an operation, and the call-up of two reserve brigades for northern duties. The ongoing violence brings back painful memories of the 2006 conflict between Hezbollah and Israel, which had a devastating toll on both sides. The U.N. reports that the current Israeli bombings have displaced 90,000 people within Lebanon. Amidst these tensions, Hezbollah claimed a significant attack on what it said was an Israeli intelligence center near Tel Aviv. Meanwhile, Iran's Foreign Minister warned of a regional catastrophe and pledged support for Lebanon against further Israeli escalations. The violence has already led to significant casualties, with hundreds killed in just a few days, marking some of the deadliest days in Lebanon's recent history, rivaling the bloodshed seen during the 1975-1990 civil war. While the link between the Gaza conflict and the situation in Lebanon remains complex, Qatar, a mediator in the discussions to end the fighting in Gaza, indicated that while the negotiations are interconnected, there isn't a direct link between the two conflict areas.The post Israel Vows to Fight Hezbollah 'Until Victory' first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-vows-fight-hezbollah-until-victory/	2024-09-26T04:40:46-07:00

Hezbollah Isn’t Hamas: Can Israel Handle Another Full-Scale War?	After nearly a year of conflict in Gaza, Israel has intensified its military operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon, launching covert strikes on communication devices and a severe bombing campaign that resulted in numerous casualties. This escalation comes amid ongoing tension with Hamas, which has already stretched Israel's military resources thin, evidenced by shortages and mounting economic and public pressure for peace and resolution of hostage situations. The possibility of an Israeli ground invasion into Lebanon remains uncertain, raising questions about Israel's capacity to manage another major conflict. The hostility between Israel and Hezbollah has escalated since October 8, the day after a deadly attack by Hamas on Israel, with Hezbollah launching attacks in solidarity with Gaza. Recent actions by Israel in Lebanon have significantly escalated tensions, including a notable operation where devices used by Hezbollah were remotely detonated, causing widespread injuries. This was followed by increased exchanges of fire, which if escalated further, could plunge Israel into a more challenging conflict with Hezbollah, a group considered more formidable than Hamas. Hezbollah, described as a 'state within a state' by Yoel Guzansky of the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), possesses advanced military capabilities and strategic ties throughout the Middle East, including Iran, Iraq, and Yemen. Despite improvements in Israeli military technology like the Iron Dome, Hezbollah's arsenal, including a large number of long-range ballistic missiles, poses a significant threat. Recent strikes by Hezbollah have reached deeper into Israeli territory than before, signaling an escalation in their capabilities. This ongoing conflict has led to significant displacement and casualties on both sides, highlighting the severe implications of this widening confrontation. Israel faces multiple challenges in a potential broader conflict with Hezbollah: 1. A more formidable opponent: Hezbollah's sophisticated weaponry and extensive network across the Middle East present a substantial challenge. 2. Stretched military resources: Israel's military is already taxed by the ongoing conflict with Hamas, and extending to another front could overstretch its capabilities. 3. Economic decline: The war's impact on Israel's economy has been severe, with significant contractions and increased military expenditures that strain financial resources. 4. Political and legitimacy issues: Internationally and domestically, there is a crisis of legitimacy and support concerning Israel's aggressive military strategies, especially if a new front opens against Hezbollah. These factors collectively complicate Israel's strategic decisions as it navigates the complexities of simultaneous conflicts on multiple fronts.The post Hezbollah Isn’t Hamas: Can Israel Handle Another Full-Scale War? first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-isnt-hamas-israel-handle-full-war/	2024-09-25T00:09:15-07:00	
Israeli Strikes Trigger Lebanon’s Deadliest Day in 20 Years: What...	On Monday, a series of airstrikes by Israel hit multiple areas across Lebanon, marking a day of significant violence not seen since the conflicts of 2006 between Israel and Hezbollah, the Iran-supported militant group. The air assaults resulted in the deaths of over 500 people and injuries to more than 1,800, sparking widespread panic among the Lebanese population. The casualties included a mix of civilians and Hezbollah militants, with bombs dropping on densely populated areas often described as Hezbollah strongholds. In response to these actions, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated that these operations were part of a strategy to alter the strategic dynamics on Israel's northern border. The Israeli military executed these strikes targeting approximately 1,600 Hezbollah-related sites, and the continuation of airstrikes into the next day suggests a sustained campaign. This escalation of violence has raised international alarms, with several nations expressing concerns about the potential for broader regional conflict and urging for de-escalation. Despite the severity of the attack, neither Israel nor Hezbollah has formally declared war, maintaining the ongoing tension as an escalation rather than outright warfare. The attacks predominantly focused on areas near Lebanon's border with Syria, a region where Hezbollah is notably active. The targets included advanced weaponry such as cruise missiles and rocket arsenals, which Israel claimed were stored within civilian areas, thereby increasing the risk to non-combatants. Many residents, receiving warnings through texts and calls, hastily evacuated their homes. In the midst of this turmoil, educational institutions closed, and transportation was disrupted, indicating a severe impact on daily life in Lebanon. The Lebanese government enacted emergency measures to manage the crisis, while the Israeli cabinet heightened security protocols across Israel in anticipation of further conflict. The situation has drawn international attention, with global powers and organizations stepping in to mediate and hopefully steer the parties away from an all-out war. This is particularly crucial as the region teeters on the brink of a broader conflict, given the historical animosity between Israel and Hezbollah and the current volatile state of affairs.The post Israeli Strikes Trigger Lebanon’s Deadliest Day in 20 Years: What We Know first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strikes-lebanons-deadliest-day-20-years/	2024-09-25T00:09:00-07:00	
Israeli Military Intercepts Rare Missile from Lebanon Near Tel Av...	On Wednesday, Israel's military reported intercepting a missile fired from Lebanon near the country's economic hub, Tel Aviv, marking a rare attack far from the usual conflict zones with Hezbollah. 'After sirens sounded in the Tel Aviv and Netanya areas, one surface-to-surface missile was detected crossing from Lebanon and was intercepted by the IDF Aerial Defense Array,' said the Israeli military. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. This escalation comes amidst ongoing tensions since last October's outbreak of conflict between Israel and Hamas. Hezbollah, backed by Iran, has been launching rockets and drones from Lebanon, primarily targeting northern Israel. The missile interception occurred just days after Israeli airstrikes killed over 500 people in Lebanon, marking Monday as the deadliest day in the country in nearly 20 years. Hezbollah has not yet commented on the missile aimed at Tel Aviv. Meanwhile, flights at Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv continued without disruption, and sirens were heard in Netanya for the first time since October 7, 2023, according to Israeli authorities.The post Israeli Military Intercepts Rare Missile from Lebanon Near Tel Aviv first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-intercepts-missile-lebanon-near-tel-aviv/	2024-09-25T00:08:44-07:00

In a speech to the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, U.S. President Joe Biden called for a diplomatic resolution as tensions escalate between Israel and Hezbollah. He cautioned against the outbreak of a 'full-scale war' in Lebanon, stressing that such a conflict would not serve anyone's interests. 'While the situation has worsened, there is still a path toward a diplomatic solution,' Biden said. He also urged Israel and Hamas to finalize the ceasefire deal that has been under negotiation for several months, emphasizing his commitment to ending the war in Gaza. 'Now is the time for the parties involved to finalize its terms,' Biden stated, referring to the agreement facilitated by the United States, Qatar, and Egypt. The proposed agreement, he explained, would 'bring the hostages home, ensure security for both Israel and Gaza free from Hamas's control, alleviate the suffering in Gaza, and bring an end to the war,' Biden concluded in his remarks to the UN General Assembly.The post Biden Urges End to Gaza Conflict, Warns of ‘Full-Scale War’ in Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/biden-end-gaza-conflict-warns-full-war-lebanon/	2024-09-25T00:08:34-07:00	
Israeli Strikes Kill 558 in Lebanon, Majority Civilians	Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon on Monday resulted in the deaths of at least 558 people, including 50 children, according to Lebanon's health ministry, making it the deadliest day of cross-border violence since the Gaza war began. The conflict has intensified dramatically, with Arab nations strongly condemning Israel's actions against Hezbollah, marking the highest levels of hostilities in nearly a year. The conflict erupted after Hamas and other Palestinian militants launched a massive attack on Israel on October 7, drawing in Hezbollah and other Iran-backed groups. Israel responded by targeting around 1,600 sites across southern and eastern Lebanon, including a 'targeted strike' in Beirut, as part of what it calls 'Operation Northern Arrows.' Hezbollah confirmed that one of its leaders, Ali Karake, had survived a targeted strike in Beirut after reports suggested he was the target. The group launched a series of missile attacks on Israeli military sites in retaliation, with air raid sirens sounding in the coastal city of Haifa. As of Tuesday, the death toll from Israeli strikes had reached 558, including 50 children, with 1,835 people wounded and taken to hospitals across Lebanon. The strikes also killed four paramedics and injured 16 others, as thousands of families fled their homes. The violence extended to the ancient city of Baalbek in eastern Lebanon, where explosions sent smoke billowing into the sky. The conflict has caused widespread panic, with people fleeing southern Lebanon and seeking shelter in Beirut. Global leaders have urged both Israel and Hezbollah to step back from the brink of all-out war. France and Egypt called for the U.N. Security Council to intervene, while Iraq requested an urgent meeting of Arab states. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant described the current escalation as a 'significant peak' in operations against Hezbollah, claiming it was the group's 'most difficult week' since its founding. Hezbollah, in response, launched rocket attacks on Israeli military sites near Haifa and other bases. The group's actions follow the death of one of its commanders, Ibrahim Akil, in an Israeli strike last Friday. Since the beginning of cross-border exchanges between Hezbollah and Israel in October, tens of thousands of people have fled their homes on both sides. Israeli officials stated that their goal is to reduce threats from Hezbollah by pushing the group back from the border and destroying its infrastructure. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati called on the international community to prevent Israel from carrying out what he described as a plan to destroy Lebanese villages and towns. As the situation worsens, U.S. President Joe Biden emphasized that Washington is working to de-escalate the conflict to allow people to safely return to their homes. The Pentagon announced the deployment of additional military personnel to the Middle East, while a U.S. official expressed opposition to an Israeli ground invasion targeting Hezbollah. Global leaders, including the G7 foreign ministers, have warned of the 'unimaginable consequences' of a potential regional war. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell stated that Israel and Hezbollah are on the verge of a 'full-fledged war.' U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed deep concern over civilian casualties in Lebanon, while the U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon warned of 'far-reaching and devastating consequences' if the violence continues. Qatar, which has been involved in mediation efforts in Gaza, condemned Israel's strikes on Lebanon, warning that the region is 'on the brink of the abyss.' Turkey echoed these concerns, warning of potential chaos, while Jordan called for an immediate end to the escalation. The Palestinian foreign ministry also condemned the Israeli strikes and sent medical support to assist those wounded in Lebanon. Iran's newly elected president, Masoud Pezeshkian, accused Israel of attempting to create a broader conflict.The post Israeli Strikes Kill 558 in Lebanon, Majority Civilians first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strikes-kill-558-lebanon-majority-civilians/	2024-09-24T07:01:50-07:00

Hezbollah launched a barrage of rockets at Kiryat Shmona in northern Israel on Tuesday, claiming the attack was carried out 'in defense of Lebanon.' This came after Israeli forces had bombed numerous targets in southern Lebanon overnight. Hezbollah also targeted Israeli military bases, including the Megiddo military airport, the Ramat David air base near Haifa, and other strategic sites, with volleys of Fadi-1 and Fadi-2 rockets. Earlier, 180 Hezbollah projectiles and an unmanned aerial vehicle crossed into Israeli airspace, triggering alarms and causing residents of Haifa to seek shelter. In response, Israel conducted further airstrikes on Lebanon, marking the deadliest bombardment since the 2006 war, which killed 492 people, including 35 children, according to Lebanon’s health ministry. Israel’s military confirmed that it struck dozens of Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon, including areas around Ayta al-Shab and Ramyah, using artillery, tanks, and airpower. Throughout Tuesday morning, 110 rockets were launched from Lebanon into northern Israel, igniting fires and damaging buildings. The largest rocket volley of 50 rockets targeted the Upper Galilee, with other attacks hitting areas south of Haifa. In northern Israel, sirens blared, and explosions were reported along highways as civilians sought cover. The Galilee Medical Center treated two individuals with minor injuries from a rocket landing near their vehicle, while others sustained injuries rushing to shelters. Later, ten more rockets fired from Lebanon injured an Israeli reservist, with shrapnel hitting a road in northern Israel. Monday's Israeli air raids in Lebanon led to the deaths of 492 people, including 35 children, and injured over 1,600, with thousands of families fleeing their homes. Journalist Nazir Reda described widespread panic, with people evacuating to Beirut in numbers not seen since the 2006 conflict. Hezbollah and Israel have been locked in near-daily cross-border skirmishes for nearly a year, following the escalation that began on October 7. Monday's strikes were the largest since the 2006 war, which left 1,200 dead in Lebanon, mostly civilians, and 160 Israelis, primarily soldiers. Israel has named its ongoing large-scale operations in Lebanon 'Operation Northern Arrows,' having recently shifted its military focus from Gaza to Lebanon. The rapid escalation has alarmed global leaders, with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressing 'grave alarm,' and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warning that the conflict is nearing a 'full-fledged war.' France and Egypt have called on the U.N. Security Council to intervene, while Iraq has requested an urgent meeting of Arab states in New York. Meanwhile, the Pentagon announced it was deploying additional U.S. military personnel to the Middle East after bolstering the region with warships, fighter jets, and air defense systems. A U.S. official indicated that Washington opposes a potential Israeli ground invasion of Lebanon and has proposed ideas to de-escalate the situation. The G7 foreign ministers warned that 'no country stands to gain' from an escalation, cautioning that a regional war could have 'unimaginable consequences.' The latest violence follows coordinated blasts of communication devices in southern Lebanon last week, which Hezbollah blamed on Israel. The blasts killed 39 people and injured nearly 3,000. Last Friday, an Israeli strike in southern Beirut killed Ibrahim Akil, a senior commander of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force. An Israeli military official stated that Israel’s goal is to 'reduce threats' from Hezbollah, push the group back from the border, and dismantle its infrastructure. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati urged the U.N. and global powers to stop what he described as Israel’s 'plan to destroy Lebanese villages and towns.' He announced plans to fly to New York to appeal to world leaders for help in stopping the violence.The post Hezbollah Strikes Kiryat Shmona, Deep Inside Israel, 'Defending Lebanon' first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-strikes-kiryat-shmona-deep-inside-israel/	2024-09-24T07:01:40-07:00

Tens of Thousands' Flee South Lebanon, Seek Shelter in the North	Lebanese families who fled from southern villages sought refuge in makeshift shelters set up in schools in Beirut and Sidon. Those unable to find shelter stayed in cars, parks, or along the seaside corniche. Monday’s intense bombardment forced thousands to evacuate south Lebanon. Hotels in Beirut filled up quickly, and families booked up apartments in the surrounding mountain areas in search of safer accommodations. On social media, some people offered empty apartments or spare rooms, while volunteers set up a kitchen at an empty gas station in Beirut to prepare meals for those displaced. In Baalbek, residents lined up at bakeries and gas stations to stock up on essential supplies, anticipating more strikes on Tuesday, as reported by the state-run National News Agency. The United Nations reported that tens of thousands of people had fled their homes in Lebanon since Monday. 'The number of displaced continues to rise,' U.N. refugee agency spokesman Matthew Saltmarsh said, calling the impact on civilians 'unacceptable.'The post 'Tens of Thousands' Flee South Lebanon, Seek Shelter in the North first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/tens-thousands-flee-lebanon-shelter-north/	2024-09-24T06:45:55-07:00

Al-Mayadeen Journalist Killed in Israeli Airstrike in South Leban...	A journalist from the pan-Arab network Al-Mayadeen was killed in Israeli airstrikes while at his home in southern Lebanon, the network reported on Tuesday. Hadi Al-Sayyed, 22, became the third journalist from the network to lose his life in the ongoing conflict between the Israeli military and Hezbollah. The network stated that he was injured on Monday and succumbed to his injuries the following day. Al-Sayyed worked in the online division of Al-Mayadeen and was at his residence in the town of Burj Rahhal, near Tyre in southern Lebanon, when the airstrike occurred. In November last year, two other members of Al-Mayadeen, correspondent Farah Omar and cameraman Rabih Al-Maamari, were killed in an Israeli strike while covering events in southern Lebanon. Additionally, Reuters video journalist Issam Abdallah was killed in Israeli shelling last October while reporting on clashes in Lebanon alongside colleagues from Al-Jazeera and Agence France-Presse. Although Abdallah’s colleagues were injured in the attack, they survived.The post Al-Mayadeen Journalist Killed in Israeli Airstrike in South Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/al-mayadeen-journalist-killed-israeli-airstrike/	2024-09-24T06:45:20-07:00	
US Engages in UN Talks for Lebanon Solution	Washington is currently holding discussions on the security situation between Lebanon and Israel alongside the United Nations General Assembly, sources informed Sky News Arabia. According to these sources, an Arab foreign ministers' meeting took place in New York to explore solutions that could prevent the escalation into a full-blown conflict in the Middle East. 'Arab countries, in cooperation with France, are engaging with Iran to establish the necessary understandings for a peaceful resolution,' the sources revealed. The efforts being led by U.S. Presidential Envoy Amos Hochstein are reportedly building on agreements made with the Lebanese parliament speaker. These discussions focus on implementing U.N. Resolution 1701 and negotiating a ceasefire, the sources added. U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told MSNBC that diplomacy is the best path to ensuring the safe return of residents in northern Israel, and emphasized that Washington will work on achieving this throughout the week. Sullivan further stated that President Joe Biden would be discussing a ceasefire with global leaders, aiming to prevent the situation from escalating into a wider conflict in the Middle East. He also reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to preventing a war between Israel and Hezbollah.The post US Engages in UN Talks for Lebanon Solution first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-engages-un-talks-lebanon-solution/	2024-09-24T06:45:07-07:00	
6 Dead, 15 Injured in Israeli Strikes on Dahieh Amid Suspected As...	An Israeli airstrike hit Hezbollah's stronghold in southern Beirut on Tuesday, according to a Lebanese security source. The Israeli military confirmed the 'targeted' strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut. The Lebanese Health Ministry reported that at least six people were killed, and 15 others were injured in the attack. 'A strike targeted two floors of a residential building in the Ghobeiri area,' said the security source, who spoke anonymously due to the sensitive nature of the information. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) stated, 'The IDF conducted a targeted strike in Beirut. More details will follow.' However, they did not provide immediate additional information. Israeli media outlets suggested that the intended target of the 'assassination' was Abou Jawad Harakeh, a key commander in Hezbollah's missile unit. Television reports indicated that the strike hit a building located across from the al-Khansa mosque in the Ghobeiri area.The post 6 Dead, 15 Injured in Israeli Strikes on Dahieh Amid Suspected Assassination Attempt first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/6-dead-15-injured-israeli-strikes-dahieh/	2024-09-24T06:44:47-07:00	
World Leaders Warn of Israel-Hezbollah 'Spiral of Violence'	World leaders on Tuesday raised serious concerns about the possibility of a broader conflict, following Israel’s deadliest airstrikes on Hezbollah in Lebanon in two decades. After nearly a year of cross-border clashes triggered by the Gaza war, Israeli air raids on Monday killed 558 people in Lebanon, including 50 children, according to the Lebanese health ministry. This marks the highest toll since the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, fueling fears of a larger war spreading across the Middle East. 'Tens of Thousands Flee' – UN UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed deep concern over the escalating violence and the growing civilian death toll, including women and children, according to his spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric. Matthew Saltmarsh, a spokesperson for the UN Refugee Agency, reported that 'tens of thousands' of people were displaced overnight, with the numbers continuing to rise. 'Spiral of Violence' – US The United States, a key ally of Israel, cautioned against any ground invasion of Lebanon. 'We do not believe that a ground invasion of Lebanon will help de-escalate tensions or prevent a spiral of violence,' said a senior US official, speaking on condition of anonymity. 'Full-Fledged War' – EU Josep Borrell, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, warned that the region was on the brink of 'full-fledged war.' He expressed concern over the increasing military strikes and civilian casualties, urging all parties to work toward de-escalation. 'Another Gaza' – Iran Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian cautioned that Lebanon must not be turned into another Gaza by Israel. Responding to questions about Iran’s influence over Hezbollah, Pezeshkian emphasized that Hezbollah could not face Israel alone, especially as it receives significant backing from Western nations, including the US and European countries. 'Attacks Against Civilians' – China China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, voiced strong opposition to the attacks on civilians, particularly noting the recent explosion of communications equipment in Lebanon. Foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian later added that China was 'deeply shocked' by the high number of casualties resulting from Israeli military actions. 'Israeli Escalation' – Jordan Jordan’s King Abdullah II called for international intervention to halt what he termed the 'danger of Israeli escalation' in Lebanon. He stressed the need to protect innocent civilians and warned that the entire region could be pulled into a wider war if the violence in Gaza is not stopped. 'Brink of the Abyss' – Qatar Qatar condemned the Israeli strikes on Lebanon, warning that the ongoing escalation could push the region 'to the brink of the abyss.' Qatar, a mediator in the Gaza ceasefire talks, expressed grave concern about the heightened tensions. 'Complete Destabilization' – Russia The Kremlin also voiced concern, with spokesperson Dmitry Peskov describing the situation as 'very dangerous' and warning that the conflict could expand, leading to the 'complete destabilization of the region.' Peskov added that Russia was 'extremely worried' about the situation. This growing alarm from world leaders underscores the urgency of addressing the escalating violence to prevent further destabilization of the Middle East.The post World Leaders Warn of Israel-Hezbollah 'Spiral of Violence' first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/world-leaders-warn-israel-hezbollah-spiral-violence/	2024-09-24T06:44:23-07:00	
Iran’s Guards Bans Pagers after Lebanon Explosions	Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) has instructed its members to cease using communication devices after thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah in Lebanon exploded in attacks last week, two senior Iranian security officials told Reuters. One official revealed that the IRGC is now conducting a large-scale inspection of all devices, not limited to communication equipment, as concerns grow about possible infiltration by Israeli agents. Many of these devices were either homemade or imported from countries like China and Russia. A thorough investigation of personnel, especially mid and high-ranking IRGC members, is underway, examining their bank accounts and travel histories. These inspections come after coordinated attacks in Hezbollah's strongholds, where pager devices detonated on Tuesday, followed by hundreds of walkie-talkies exploding on Wednesday. These incidents resulted in 39 deaths and over 3,000 injuries. Lebanon and Hezbollah have blamed Israel for the attacks, though Israel has neither confirmed nor denied involvement. The IRGC is now using encrypted messaging systems for communication, according to the officials. Iran’s leadership is particularly concerned about the security of its nuclear and missile facilities, which have seen heightened protective measures since last year, following Israel's alleged attempts to sabotage Iran's missile program. The IRGC, a powerful force in Iran, is closely linked to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and oversees the country’s strategic military operations, including through its Al Quds Force, which supports groups such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, and others across the Middle East. Iranian military communication relies heavily on domestically developed, encrypted systems, largely due to Western sanctions. While Iran has previously imported communication equipment from China, Russia, and Japan, the country has largely transitioned to self-developed military-grade systems in recent years. Iran and Israel have been involved in a shadow war for decades, often accusing each other of sabotage and assassination plots. The conflict has intensified alongside the Gaza war, and both nations have exchanged blame for high-profile assassinations in recent months. Israel views Iran as an existential threat, accusing it of trying to develop nuclear weapons, a charge Iran denies. Iran, for its part, does not recognize Israel's right to exist, with Supreme Leader Khamenei repeatedly calling for Israel's destruction.The post Iran’s Guards Bans Pagers after Lebanon Explosions first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/irans-guards-bans-pagers-lebanon-explosions/	2024-09-23T02:29:13-07:00	
Israeli Defense Minister Briefs US on Military Operations Against...	Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, updated his U.S. counterpart, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, on Sunday about the Israeli military’s ongoing operations against Hezbollah. This came after the exchange of the most intense fire between Israel and the Iran-backed group since the Gaza war began. In a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Monday, Gallant shared that he provided Austin with an assessment of Hezbollah’s threats and detailed the Israel Defense Forces' (IDF) efforts to reduce the group's ability to launch attacks against Israeli civilians. Their discussion also covered broader regional concerns and the threats posed by Iran and its allies. The Pentagon noted that Austin and Gallant had also spoken earlier on Sunday, following Hezbollah’s rocket attacks on Israel. During the call, Austin reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to Israel’s right to self-defense and emphasized the importance of finding a diplomatic solution to allow displaced northern Israeli residents to return home. On Monday, Israel’s military conducted 'extensive strikes' on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon and urged civilians to vacate areas where the militant group operates in anticipation of further attacks. For context, prior to twin attacks on Hezbollah's communication devices last week, Israeli officials informed the U.S. about an upcoming operation in Lebanon but did not disclose specifics, according to sources familiar with the matter. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken later clarified that the U.S. was neither informed of the exact details nor involved in these incidents.The post Israeli Defense Minister Briefs US on Military Operations Against Hezbollah first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-defense-minister-briefs-us-operations-hezbollah/	2024-09-23T02:03:39-07:00	
China Urges Citizens to Leave Lebanon and Israel Immediately	China has issued an advisory on Monday urging its citizens in Lebanon and Israel to either evacuate or relocate to safer areas as tensions between Israel and Hezbollah continue to escalate.

The advisory emphasized that those who must remain in Lebanon should exercise heightened caution, strengthen security measures, and avoid high-risk and sensitive areas, particularly in the south. Additionally, on Sunday, the Chinese Embassy in Israel warned citizens to be prepared for potential threats such as missile, rocket, or drone attacks. The embassy also advised against traveling to Israel and urged people to avoid high-risk areas, particularly in northern regions of the country.The post China Urges Citizens to Leave Lebanon and Israel Immediately first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/china-urges-citizens-leave-lebanon-israel-immediately/	2024-09-23T02:03:06-07:00

Israeli Strikes Claim Three Lives in South Lebanon	Lebanon's health ministry reported that three people were killed on Sunday in separate Israeli strikes on southern Lebanon, while Israel confirmed it was targeting Hezbollah positions in the region. According to the ministry, the fatalities occurred in three different villages in the south. On the same day, Hezbollah announced the deaths of two of its fighters, though it did not specify the exact location of the incidents. In retaliation, the group said it deployed drones loaded with explosives towards two Israeli military positions near the border. Earlier on Sunday, Hezbollah claimed responsibility for launching multiple rockets at military production sites and an airbase close to the northern Israeli city of Haifa. The Israeli military confirmed that overnight, rockets, cruise missiles, and drones were fired towards Israeli territory, mostly from Lebanon. Since the beginning of the Gaza conflict, which was triggered by Hamas' attack on Israel on October 7, Hezbollah has been engaging in near-daily exchanges of fire with Israeli forces in support of Hamas. Tensions have escalated sharply in recent days. On Tuesday and Wednesday, dozens were killed and thousands injured in Lebanon when explosions occurred, involving Hezbollah's communication devices. The group has accused Israel of being behind the attacks, though Israel has not commented. Additionally, on Friday, an Israeli airstrike targeting Hezbollah military leaders in Beirut's southern suburbs killed 45 people, most of whom were civilians, according to the health ministry.The post Israeli Strikes Claim Three Lives in South Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strikes-three-lives-south-lebanon/	2024-09-23T02:01:30-07:00

Shepherd Killed in Bekaa Amid Dozens of Israeli Strikes on Lebano...	Israeli airstrikes struck various parts of southern and eastern Lebanon on Monday, with official reports indicating that at least one civilian was killed. According to Lebanon's National News Agency (NNA), Israeli warplanes carried out over 80 airstrikes within a 30-minute span, particularly targeting the Nabatiyeh district in southern Lebanon. Other strikes were reported in the Tyre region. Simultaneously, intense air raids were carried out in Lebanon’s eastern Bekaa Valley near the Syrian border, including areas around Baalbek and the outskirts of Hermel. The NNA confirmed that these strikes claimed the life of a shepherd and injured two of his family members, along with four others. Hezbollah also reported that one of its fighters had been killed. Correspondents from AFP in both the southern and eastern regions of Lebanon confirmed hearing the sounds of heavy airstrikes. A Hezbollah source noted that the strikes in the Bekaa Valley extended from east to west. Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari issued a warning to civilians living in Lebanese villages near Hezbollah military targets, urging them to evacuate for their own safety. Hagari emphasized that Israel’s military is prepared to launch more extensive and precise strikes on Hezbollah’s military infrastructure, which he said is widely embedded throughout Lebanon. Hezbollah has been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since the October 7 attack by Hamas, which sparked the ongoing conflict in Gaza. In recent days, the escalation between Israel and Hezbollah has intensified, raising concerns over the potential for a broader conflict.The post Shepherd Killed in Bekaa Amid Dozens of Israeli Strikes on Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/shepherd-killed-bekaa-dozens-strikes-lebanon/	2024-09-23T02:00:45-07:00	
Al Jazeera Airs Footage of Israeli Military Shutting Down Ramalla...	Al Jazeera aired live footage of Israeli soldiers entering its offices in Ramallah, located in the occupied West Bank, and ordering the closure of the office for 45 days. The broadcast showed Al Jazeera’s bureau chief, Walid Omary, and other staff members live on air when the soldiers arrived. A soldier informed Omary of a military order to shut down the office for 45 days and instructed the staff to leave the premises immediately. Omary, reading the military order on air, stated that the staff were required to collect their personal belongings and cameras before leaving. Al Jazeera’s Ramallah office has been a vital hub for the network, especially after Israel closed its Jerusalem office in May and confiscated some communication equipment. That earlier move sparked condemnation from the United Nations and various human rights groups, accusing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of undermining press freedoms. Once the Al Jazeera staff had vacated the Ramallah office, live footage showed Omary and others standing outside on the street, with Omary reporting that soldiers had taken control of the office and were seizing materials. Shortly thereafter, as Israeli soldiers approached Omary, the live feed was cut, and Omary could be heard saying that the soldiers had confiscated the camera and broadcast equipment the team had been using. CNN has reached out to both Al Jazeera and the Israeli military for comment.The post Al Jazeera Airs Footage of Israeli Military Shutting Down Ramallah Office first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/al-jazeera-footage-israeli-shutting-ramallah-office/	2024-09-22T00:07:55-07:00	
Israel Shuts Schools and Limits Gatherings in the North	Israel has implemented new restrictions on public activities in northern regions, including parts of the Golan Heights, as tensions with Hezbollah intensify.

During this period, schools in the affected areas will remain closed, and public gatherings will be limited to 10 people outdoors and 100 people indoors. Beaches in the region will also be off-limits to the public, though work-related activities may continue provided that access to nearby shelters is available. The restrictions impact areas such as the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and the upper and lower Galilee. These measures follow a previous military warning about the potential for a Hezbollah attack in the near future, as hostilities in the region continue to escalate.The post Israel Shuts Schools and Limits Gatherings in the North first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-shuts-schools-limits-gatherings-north/	2024-09-22T00:05:08-07:00	
Breaking: Israeli Army Launches Airstrikes in Southern Lebanon	The Israeli military reported that late Saturday, dozens of warplanes were conducting strikes on Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon, as cross-border clashes intensified, raising concerns about a broader conflict. Israel also implemented additional security measures for its northern region. Military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari stated in a televised address shortly after 8:00 pm (1700 GMT) that Israeli forces were conducting extensive operations in southern Lebanon after identifying Hezbollah’s plans to launch attacks on Israeli territory. 'Dozens of air force aircraft are currently targeting terrorist sites and launchers to neutralize threats against Israeli civilians,' he said. Another wave of airstrikes was launched approximately three hours later. Earlier, Israel claimed to have targeted thousands of Hezbollah rocket launchers and other military assets. This escalation came a day after an Israeli airstrike in southern Beirut killed 37 people, including senior Hezbollah commanders, according to Lebanese officials. The strike followed a series of sabotage attacks on communication devices used by Hezbollah earlier in the week, which killed 39 people and injured around 3,000. Hezbollah attributed the attacks to Israel, although Israel has not confirmed its involvement. Hezbollah has been launching cross-border assaults on Israel following Hamas’ unprecedented attack on southern Israel on October 7, which sparked the current war in Gaza. Thousands of people have been displaced on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border due to the hostilities. On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expanded the objectives of Israel’s military campaign to include the return of displaced residents in northern Israel. Rear Admiral Hagari warned that there could be further rocket launches and other threats against Israel in the near future. Late Saturday, the Israeli military announced stricter public gathering rules for northern Israel. Outdoor gatherings are now limited to 30 people, while indoor events are capped at 300 participants. Additionally, workplaces and educational institutions can remain open as long as there are adequate shelter facilities available.The post Breaking: Israeli Army Launches Airstrikes in Southern Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-army-airstrikes-southern-lebanon/	2024-09-22T00:02:09-07:00	
Slain Israeli Hostage Held by Hamas in Brutal Conditions Beneath ...	The sisters of an Israeli woman, Eden Yerushalmi, who was kidnapped and later killed by Hamas, have described the 'inhuman' conditions of her captivity, sharing their painful experience with CNN. They have been living through what they call a 'nightmare' since her body was found by the Israeli military in a tunnel in Gaza. Eden was abducted from the Nova music festival during Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel. Her body was one of six recovered by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) late last month. Shani and May, Eden's sisters, recounted to CNN's Anderson Cooper that they had received evidence of Eden being alive on three separate occasions, the last of which was just three weeks before her death. Shani expressed how difficult it has been for the family, saying, 'It feels like we’re in a nightmare&#8230; We truly believed Eden would come back home alive.' According to details shared by the IDF after her body was returned, Eden had been held captive in a narrow, windowless tunnel with no air or light, along with limited food. The captives could only sleep in a line and had to use a bucket as a toilet. Eden’s body, found in a Hamas-controlled tunnel under Rafah, showed signs of brutal treatment. The IDF informed the family that she was shot at close range and bore marks on her hands, indicating she tried to defend herself. The deaths of Eden and five other Israeli captives have sparked widespread anger in Israel, particularly directed at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government for its handling of the crisis. Israeli officials reported that more than 1,200 people were killed, and 250 taken hostage during the October 7 attack, while over 40,000 Palestinians have been killed since the conflict began. Eden, along with Hersh Goldberg-Polin and Carmel Gat, had been listed for release as part of a humanitarian agreement between Israel and Hamas. However, delays in executing the deal have stirred controversy, with some blaming the Israeli government. Eden was a 23-year-old Pilates instructor and bartender at the Nova music festival. On the day of the attack, she sent a video of the rocket fire to her family, saying she was leaving the festival. She stayed in contact with her sisters for four hours as she tried to escape, until her final message: 'They’ve caught me.' Her sister May, who chose to see Eden's body after its return, said, 'We gave her a last hug to say goodbye&#8230; She was so thin, we could feel her bones sticking out,' with the autopsy revealing she weighed just 79 pounds. The sisters remembered Eden as a kind and warm-hearted person, with May adding, 'The most important thing is that she was a hero, and she survived 11 months in those tunnels.'The post Slain Israeli Hostage Held by Hamas in Brutal Conditions Beneath Gaza first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/slain-israeli-hostage-hamas-brutal-conditions-gaza/	2024-09-21T03:09:32-07:00

In a press conference on Saturday, Abiad confirmed that the victims included three children and seven women. Additionally, three Syrian nationals were among those killed, while 68 people were reported injured. Hezbollah has also confirmed that at least 16 of its members, including high-ranking commanders, died in the airstrike, which took place on Friday. Rescue teams were still working to clear the rubble on Saturday, searching for missing persons. Abiad noted that some of the body parts recovered were unidentifiable. The minister also updated the death toll from the earlier explosions targeting Hezbollah members via pagers and walkie-talkies, which had risen to 39: 12 people died on Tuesday and 27 more on Wednesday.The post Israeli Strike on South Beirut Kills Hezbollah Commander, Death Toll Climbs to 31 first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strike-beirut-death-toll-31/	2024-09-21T03:09:15-07:00	
Hezbollah Commander Ibrahim Akil Reportedly Targeted in Dahieh St...	Ibrahim Akil, whom Israel claimed to have killed in an airstrike on Beirut’s southern suburbs on Friday, was the head of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan unit and had been on a U.S. sanctions list for nearly a decade. The United States had identified Akil as a 'key leader' within Hezbollah and had offered a $7 million reward for information about him. His death marks the second time in nearly a year that a top Hezbollah commander has been killed during ongoing clashes between the militant group and Israel related to the Gaza conflict. Like many of Hezbollah’s military leaders, little was publicly known about Akil, who was referred to by his alias, Hajj Abdul Qader, within the group. According to a source close to Hezbollah, Akil was the second-highest military leader after Fouad Shukur, who was killed by an Israeli airstrike in Beirut’s southern stronghold on July 30. Lebanese officials have reported that Israel has repeatedly demanded, through international intermediaries, that Hezbollah’s Radwan Force, which leads the group’s ground operations, be moved away from the border. Radwan Unit and Akil's Role The Radwan Force is Hezbollah’s most powerful offensive unit, with its fighters trained in cross-border operations, according to a source close to the group. Some of these fighters have combat experience beyond Lebanon, including in Syria, where Hezbollah has openly supported President Bashar al-Assad’s forces since 2013. The U.S. Treasury previously stated that Akil 'played a vital role' in Hezbollah’s Syrian campaign. Since October, Hezbollah has lost two of its three regional commanders in southern Lebanon, Mohammed Naameh Nasser, who was killed in July by an Israeli airstrike, and Taleb Abdallah, who died in a strike a month earlier. Additionally, the Radwan Force lost commander Wissam Tawil in January. Akil was also a member of Hezbollah’s Jihad Council, the group’s highest military authority. The U.S. Treasury described him as a 'principal member' of the Islamic Jihad Organization, a Hezbollah-affiliated group responsible for the 1983 U.S. embassy bombing in Beirut, which killed 63 people, and the same year’s bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks, which killed 241 soldiers. In the late 1980s, Akil was involved in the kidnapping of two German nationals and bombings in Paris in 1986. He was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury as a terrorist in 2015, and in 2019, the U.S. State Department designated him as a 'Specially Designated Global Terrorist.'The post Hezbollah Commander Ibrahim Akil Reportedly Targeted in Dahieh Strike first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-ibrahim-akil-targeted-dahieh-strike/	2024-09-21T03:09:02-07:00

Israel’s Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, stated on Friday that the nation’s adversaries would not find safety in Beirut’s southern suburb, where an airstrike killed a key Hezbollah commander. 'Our enemies have no safe haven — not even in the Dahieh in Beirut,' Gallant posted on X, referencing the area where Israel confirmed the death of Ibrahim Akil, the commander of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan unit, along with 'around 10' other senior militants.The post Gallant: No Safe Haven for ‘Enemies’ in Hezbollah’s Beirut Stronghold first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/gallant-no-safe-haven-enemies-hezbollahs/	2024-09-21T03:08:44-07:00	
Outrage Flares After Deadly Israeli Strike on Dahieh	Israel announced that it had killed the commander of Hezbollah's elite Radwan unit in a strike on Friday, which Lebanese officials reported left 12 people dead and many others wounded in Hezbollah's stronghold in Beirut. Iranian Embassy Condemns the Attack Following the strike, the Iranian embassy in Lebanon condemned what it called 'Israeli madness' after the assault on Hezbollah’s stronghold in southern Beirut. The embassy stated, 'We strongly condemn the Israeli madness and arrogance that has gone beyond all limits by targeting residential areas in Beirut's southern suburbs.' Hamas Labels the Strike a 'Brutal Escalation' Hamas also condemned the Israeli strike, calling it a 'brutal' escalation. The group’s statement denounced the attack, saying, 'We condemn the brutal and terrorist aggression launched by the Zionist enemy's military on the southern suburb of Beirut,' referring to the incident as an escalation of Israeli aggression. United Nations Expresses Concern and Calls for Restraint The United Nations expressed deep concern over the heightened tensions following the Israeli strikes in Beirut. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric, urged all parties to show 'maximum restraint' and called for immediate de-escalation, stating, 'We are very concerned about the intensified escalation&#8230; including today's deadly strikes in Beirut.'The post Outrage Flares After Deadly Israeli Strike on Dahieh first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/outrage-deadly-israeli-strike-dahieh/	2024-09-21T03:08:35-07:00	
Trump Calls US Election 'Most Important' for Israel’s Future	Former President Donald Trump characterized the upcoming U.S. election as critically significant for Israel, warning that Israel could be 'eradicated,' 'wiped off the face of the earth,' and 'cease to exist' if Vice President Kamala Harris were to become president. During an event focused on antisemitism in the U.S., Trump expressed frustration over what he perceived as a lack of sufficient support from Jewish voters, despite his policies favoring Israel. He urged Jewish voters to prioritize defeating Harris. 'You must defeat Kamala Harris more than anyone else,' Trump told Jewish audience members, adding emphatically that it was crucial for Israel's interests. He also pledged to 'make Israel great again.' In response, Amy Spitalnick, CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs and a former aide to Democratic officials in New York, criticized Trump for using the antisemitism event as a platform to propagate antisemitic stereotypes and attack the American Jewish community. She noted that politicizing Jews and Israel in such a manner jeopardizes the safety of Jews, Israel, and the broader community.The post Trump Calls US Election 'Most Important' for Israel’s Future first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/trump-us-election-most-important-israels/	2024-09-20T03:46:12-07:00	
Israel Signals War Readiness with Hezbollah, Escalation Fears Mou...	This week, a series of deadly blasts from pagers and walkie-talkies revealed a significant breach in Hezbollah’s communication networks across Lebanon, resulting in at least 37 fatalities, including children, and injuring over 3,000 individuals. In response to the blasts, Hezbollah has threatened reprisal against Israel, though it remains uncertain how the Iran-supported militia will react given the compromise to their operational security. Israel's Defense Minister has indicated the onset of a 'new era' in its military strategy, suggesting a focus shift towards the north, near the Lebanese border. This statement subtly confirms the military's involvement in the communications equipment explosions. The covert operations executed this week pose a risk of escalating tensions in the already volatile region. Here are the key developments: Cross-border Engagements Significant military exchanges occurred between Israel and Hezbollah on Thursday. The Israeli military reported targeting around 100 rocket launchers, while Hezbollah claimed at least 17 strikes on Israeli military sites. Israeli Military Activity in Beirut During Nasrallah’s initial speech post-attacks, Israel conducted low altitude flights over Beirut, releasing flares and causing sonic booms, an event captured live by CNN’s Ben Wedeman. Retaliation Promises Hezbollah leader Nasrallah has sternly condemned the covert strikes on communication devices, declaring that Israel has breached critical limits and promising forthcoming retaliation. Iran’s Stance The Revolutionary Guard Corps Commander Hossein Salami of Iran conveyed to Nasrallah that Israel will face a potent and decisive retaliation from the 'axis of resistance,' a coalition of Shia militias across four Middle Eastern nations. Hezbollah’s Capabilities Known as the most heavily armed non-state actor globally, Hezbollah now finds its reputation for being well-equipped and disciplined compromised due to the device attacks. International Reaction A panel of United Nations experts has criticized the attacks on communication devices, labeling them as serious violations of international law and the human right to life, describing these actions as 'terrifying.'The post Israel Signals War Readiness with Hezbollah, Escalation Fears Mount first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-war-readiness-hezbollah-escalation-fears/	2024-09-20T03:44:27-07:00	
Nasrallah Promises Fierce Retaliation to Israel	Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah declared on Thursday that Israel will face severe consequences for the explosions of communication devices that resulted in 37 deaths and nearly 3,000 injuries over the past two days. In his first public address following the incidents, Nasrallah promised that Israel would encounter 'stern retribution and just punishment' both in expected and unexpected forms. He chose not to disclose any specifics regarding the timing, location, or method of Hezbollah's intended response. During his televised speech, Israeli fighter jets were reported to disrupt the calm over Beirut, flying at low altitudes and deploying flares designed to mislead heat-seeking missiles. Nasrallah also spoke directly to Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, stating that military actions would not enable the resettlement of displaced northern residents. He emphasized that no form of military escalation or violence would facilitate their return to the border areas. He asserted that the only solution for returning the displaced individuals to their homes in the north lies in ceasing hostilities in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Additionally, Nasrallah announced that Hezbollah is conducting an internal investigation into the blast of hundreds of their operatives' communication devices throughout Lebanon. He acknowledged that these incidents represented a significant and unprecedented setback for Hezbollah but insisted they would not be defeated. Nasrallah revealed that messages indicating the strikes were intended to cease hostilities on the Lebanese front had been received, along with warnings of further actions if the fighting did not stop. Despite this, he reassured that the extensive bombings had not compromised the group's operational capabilities.The post Nasrallah Promises Fierce Retaliation to Israel first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/nasrallah-promises-retaliation-israel/	2024-09-20T03:44:14-07:00	
Israeli Airstrikes Target Hezbollah Following Death of 2 Troops	On Thursday, the Israeli military initiated new assaults on Hezbollah locations in Lebanon, concurrently with the sounding of alert sirens across northern Israel, suggesting possible incoming attacks. The military disclosed that the operations were aimed at diminishing Hezbollah's terrorist capabilities and infrastructure. This action forms part of a broader initiative to enable displaced Israelis to return to their residences in the northern regions. Additionally, the Israeli forces reported the deaths of two soldiers due to rocket strikes from Hezbollah near the northern Lebanese border. The casualties were Reservist Major Nael Fwarsy, aged 43, and Sergeant Tomer Keren, aged 20, who both died in separate encounters, according to military sources. Hezbollah seemed to escalate its retaliatory strikes on Thursday. This increase in hostility followed the explosion of communication devices belonging to thousands of its members across Lebanon, incidents that have been attributed to Israel. These explosions resulted in 37 deaths and nearly 3,000 injuries over a span of two days.The post Israeli Airstrikes Target Hezbollah Following Death of 2 Troops first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-airstrikes-hezbollah-death-2/	2024-09-20T03:43:51-07:00	
Israel Strikes South Lebanon as Hezbollah Escalates Attacks	Israel's military confirmed that its jets targeted approximately 100 Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon during two waves of intense airstrikes overnight. The strikes hit about 100 launchers and additional Hezbollah infrastructure, including around 1,000 barrels that were reportedly set for immediate firing, according to the Israeli army. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported that the southern region was hit at least 52 times during the night, marking one of the most significant bombardments by Israel since the border skirmishes began last October. In response, Hezbollah launched at least 17 attacks on Israeli military sites in northern Israel on Thursday. These developments, including the deadly explosions in Lebanon earlier in the week and Thursday's heavy bombardments, came after Israel declared a shift in its war objectives, focusing on its northern border with Lebanon, where clashes with Hezbollah have intensified. For nearly a year, Israel's military efforts had been concentrated on the Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza. However, it has also been engaged in frequent exchanges of fire with Hezbollah along the northern border. International mediators have been working to prevent a full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah and to contain the regional impact of the conflict in Gaza, which was triggered by Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel. Hezbollah maintains that its attacks are in support of Hamas, and its leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, pledged on Thursday that these attacks will persist as long as the war in Gaza continues. The cross-border exchanges have claimed hundreds of lives in Lebanon, most of them fighters, and dozens in Israel, including soldiers. The ongoing violence has also forced tens of thousands of residents on both sides of the border to flee their homes. During a visit to Israeli troops on Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant warned that Hezbollah 'will pay an increasing price' as Israel seeks to secure the safe return of its citizens to the border areas. 'We are at the start of a new phase in the war,' he said. Iran's Revolutionary Guards also warned Israel of a 'crushing response from the resistance front' following the recent blasts, which injured Tehran's ambassador in Beirut. Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who has been working to facilitate a ceasefire in Gaza and negotiate the release of hostages, called for restraint from all sides, emphasizing the importance of avoiding actions that could escalate the situation. He joined European foreign ministers in Paris to discuss the ongoing crisis. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre reiterated that President Joe Biden believes a diplomatic resolution between Israel and Hezbollah is still possible.The post Israel Strikes South Lebanon as Hezbollah Escalates Attacks first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-strikes-south-lebanon-hezbollah-escalates-attacks/	2024-09-20T03:43:38-07:00	
Taiwan Questions Two in Hezbollah Pager Investigation	Taiwan Questions Two in Hezbollah Pager InvestigaTaiwan Questions Two in He Two individuals from Taiwanese companies were questioned in connection with an investigation into pagers that exploded while being used by Hezbollah operatives in Lebanon, according to investigators on Friday. Top officials in Taiwan have emphasized that the devices were not sourced from the island. The origin and supply of the pagers have been the subject of speculation after hundreds of them, along with walkie-talkies, detonated across Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday, resulting in at least 37 deaths and nearly 3,000 injuries. A report by The New York Times suggested that Israel had inserted explosive material into a shipment of pagers from Taiwan's Gold Apollo, citing anonymous American and other officials. However, Gold Apollo’s head, Hsu Ching-kuang, denied that his company produced the devices in question, attributing the production to Hungary-based partner BAC Consulting KFT, which had been licensed to use Gold Apollo’s trademark. Reports indicated that the second individual questioned was Wu Yu-jen, a representative connected to BAC Consulting KFT, who had established a Taipei-based company called 'Apollo Systems.' Taipei's Shilin District Prosecutors' Office issued a statement on Friday, saying, 'Our country takes this case very seriously.' The office confirmed that two individuals from Taiwanese companies had been interviewed as witnesses and released after multiple rounds of questioning. Authorities also conducted searches in four locations, including Gold Apollo’s site in New Taipei City’s Xizhi district and the Neihu district of Taipei, where Apollo Systems is registered. Wu did not speak to reporters when brought in for questioning on Thursday, according to local news footage. Taiwan's Economic Minister Kuo Jyh-huei told reporters that Gold Apollo's pagers, made in Taiwan, consist of basic components like low-end integrated circuits (IC) and batteries, and he stressed, 'These things would not explode.' He added that the company had exported 260,000 pagers in the past two years without any previous incidents of explosions. Kuo assured that the pagers used by Hezbollah were not produced in Taiwan. Premier Cho Jung-tai also reiterated on Friday that neither the company nor Taiwan had directly exported pagers to Lebanon. Earlier this week, Gold Apollo clarified that the pager model mentioned in media reports was produced and sold by BAC. However, a Hungarian government spokesperson stated that BAC Consulting KFT is merely a trading intermediary with no manufacturing or operational site in Hungary. zbollah Pager InvestigationtionThe post Taiwan Questions Two in Hezbollah Pager Investigation first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/taiwan-questions-two-hezbollah-pager-investigation/	2024-09-20T03:43:27-07:00	
It is Fake News that Bulgaria is Linked to Exploding Devices in L...	Multiple fake news articles continously appear throughout the web that Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, has connections to the heart-breaking events in Lebanon. International investigators have ruled out the possibility of explosive devices being transported through Bulgaria. Experts say that Bulgarian connection to this event is fake news. In a statement released by the Bulgarian authorities and National Security State Agency, is stated that 'After thorough internal investigations, no customs procedures involving communication devices (pagers) have been processed through Bulgarian territory.' Fake news have been traced back to a Hungarian news website which blames a Bulgarian company, called Norta Global Ltd, to have delivered the devices to Lebanon from Bulgaria. Meanwhile, Hungarian government authorities and private Hungarian media websites have been flagged by the West to have strong support for the Russian president Vladimir Putin. Victor Orban has been repeatedly accused of being the only supporter of the Russian aggression inside the EU. The statement came in response to media reports suggesting that a company based in Bulgaria had supplied Hezbollah in Lebanon with the devices that later exploded in Lebanon and Syria. The Sofia-based company in question, Norta Global Ltd., owned by a Norwegian citizen, has been manipulatively linked to the sale of these devices by the Hungarian media. It is not the first time that Russian propaganda has been supported by third party members, in order to blame countries that support the Ukrainian defence. Western investigators are currently conducting joint investigations with the National Revenue Agency and the Bulgarian Ministry of Interior into the possible involvement of a Bulgarian-registered company in supplying communication equipment to Hezbollah. No physical proof has been found that Bulgarian citizens are connected to the sale of the devices. However, there are numerous fake articles in the web on this topic. Norta Global Ltd. was registered in April 2022 as a project management company. However, there is no evidence that the company manufactures products, and no financial records have been found. The company shares its registered address in downtown Sofia and it is currently non-operational. The owner of the company is the Norwegian citizen Rinson Jose, who also has a different company in Hungary. Hezbollah received thousands of pagers as part of a move to create a more secure communication network. This distribution increased significantly after Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah advised members to steer clear of cellphones, labeling them as tools of Israeli surveillance, and recommended pagers as a more secure option. At the same time, walkie-talkies that detonated on Wednesday were acquired around the same time as the pagers, back in April. Icom Inc., a Japanese company that manufactures the handheld radios in question, stated that the models in question were discontinued about ten years ago. The company is currently investigating and confirmed on Thursday that their IC-V82 radios had been shipped to the Middle East between 2004 and 2014. These unusual incidents, which Hezbollah has blamed on Israel, have left the Lebanese public in shock. According to the Saudi Al Hadath network, citing Iranian sources, many are now hastily discarding their wireless devices, as the walkie-talkies that exploded on Wednesday are also commonly used in Iran.The post It is Fake News that Bulgaria is Linked to Exploding Devices in Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/fake-news-that-bulgaria-is-linked-to-exploding-devices-in-lebanon/	2024-09-19T13:37:14-07:00

White House Warns of ‘Escalation’ in Mideast Following Lebanon Bl...	The White House has urged all parties to avoid escalating the conflict in the Middle East following two days of explosions in Lebanon, widely linked to Israel, targeting Hezbollah with handheld devices. 'We do not want to see any further escalation. We believe the solution to the current crisis is not through more military action,' National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Wednesday. Kirby emphasized that diplomacy remains the best path to avoid opening another front in Lebanon, which could further complicate the situation. Iran, a supporter of Hezbollah, has refrained from a major response following an attack in Tehran that killed a senior Hamas leader. Since Hamas' October 7 assault, Israel has engaged in ongoing clashes with Hezbollah, which also receives backing from Iran. When asked about whether Israel was complying with international humanitarian law in the attacks on pagers and walkie-talkies in Lebanon, Kirby said, 'As we've maintained from the beginning, Israel has a right to defend itself.' He added that the U.S. continues to communicate with Israel about how they conduct their operations but did not confirm Israel's involvement in the blasts. Kirby reiterated that the U.S. had no involvement in the incidents: 'We were not involved in yesterday's or today's events in any way.'The post White House Warns of ‘Escalation’ in Mideast Following Lebanon Blasts first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/white-house-warns-escalation-in-mideast-lebanon-blasts/	2024-09-19T03:59:23-07:00

Top diplomats from the United States, Britain, Germany, France, and Italy are set to meet in Paris on Thursday to address the escalating tensions in the Middle East, sources revealed on Wednesday. The gathering comes amid increasing fears of a broader regional conflict, as violence in Gaza intensifies and Lebanon experiences two days of explosive attacks, which Hezbollah has blamed on Israel. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will join his counterparts from these allied nations in the French capital following talks in Cairo focused on a possible truce in Gaza. Blinken's visit aims to revive stalled negotiations, mediated by Egypt, Qatar, and the U.S., to bring an end to the ongoing conflict. He emphasized that a ceasefire in Gaza would be the most effective way to prevent further violence from spreading throughout the region. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani, who confirmed his attendance, also noted that discussions would include the ongoing war in Ukraine.The post US, European Diplomats to Tackle Mideast Tensions Thursday in Paris first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-european-diplomats-tackle-mideast-tensions-paris/	2024-09-19T03:59:00-07:00

Blinken Arrives in Egypt to Push for Gaza Ceasefire	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Cairo on Wednesday in an effort to revive ceasefire negotiations for Gaza, a process made more difficult by recent explosions targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon. This marked Blinken's 10th trip to the Middle East since the Gaza conflict began nearly a year ago. During his visit, he met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and planned a press conference with Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty. However, there are no plans for him to travel to other Arab capitals or Israel. According to the U.S. State Department, the primary focus of Blinken’s visit was discussing the ongoing negotiation efforts with Egyptian officials. Although U.S. officials privately acknowledged they did not expect significant breakthroughs, Blinken aimed to sustain pressure for a potential agreement between Israel and Hamas. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller emphasized the importance of moving toward a deal without further delays, while avoiding any specific timeline for a proposal. The key sticking points include Israel's refusal to withdraw from the Philadelphi corridor on the Egypt-Gaza border and new demands from Hamas regarding the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. Blinken’s visit also came after explosions hit Hezbollah members' pagers across Lebanon, killing at least nine and injuring 2,800 others, an attack that Hezbollah blamed on Israel. Israel has not commented on the blasts, but had earlier stated it was broadening its war aims to include targeting Hezbollah. While in Cairo, Blinken is also expected to discuss strengthening U.S.-Egypt relations. Egypt, although frequently accused of human rights abuses, remains a key U.S. partner. Last week, Washington released $1.3 billion in military aid to Egypt without imposing rights conditions, unlike the previous year. After his Cairo visit, Blinken is scheduled to travel to Paris to brief officials from France, Britain, and Italy.The post Blinken Arrives in Egypt to Push for Gaza Ceasefire first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/blinken-arrives-egypt-push-gaza-ceasefire/	2024-09-18T02:27:06-07:00	
Nasrallah to Address Nation Thursday Following Pager Blasts	Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah is set to deliver a speech on Thursday, following a series of explosions involving pagers used by Hezbollah members across Lebanon. According to a statement released by Hezbollah on Wednesday, Nasrallah will address 'the latest developments' in a speech scheduled for 5:00 pm (1400 GMT). In response to the deadly explosions, which the group has blamed on Israel, Hezbollah reaffirmed its commitment to ongoing operations in support of Gaza. The group stated, 'This path is ongoing and separate from the difficult reckoning that the criminal enemy must await for its massacre on Tuesday,' referencing the recent attacks. The speech is expected to touch on these incidents and Hezbollah's continued activities amid the current regional tensions.The post Nasrallah to Address Nation Thursday Following Pager Blasts first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/nasrallah-address-nation-pager-blasts/	2024-09-18T02:26:41-07:00	
Taiwan’s Gold Apollo Blames Hungary for Exploding Pagers	Gold Apollo, a Taiwanese company, confirmed on Wednesday that it had authorized the use of its brand on the pagers involved in recent explosions in Lebanon and Syria, though the devices were actually manufactured by BAC Consulting KFT, a company based in Budapest. These pagers, which were primarily used by Hezbollah, detonated nearly simultaneously on Tuesday, leading to the deaths of at least nine people, including an 8-year-old girl, and wounding nearly 3,000 others. Hezbollah and the Lebanese government have accused Israel of orchestrating the attack, which appears to have been a sophisticated remote operation. An anonymous U.S. official revealed that Israel had briefed the U.S. after the operation's conclusion, stating that small explosives hidden inside the pagers had been remotely triggered. In a statement on Wednesday, Gold Apollo explained that while it allowed BAC to use its brand in specific regions, the design and manufacturing of the pagers were entirely BAC's responsibility. The AR-924 pager model, involved in the explosions, was known for its rugged build and long battery life, critical features in a country like Lebanon, where power outages are frequent. The attacks primarily targeted areas where Hezbollah holds significant influence, such as southern Beirut and the Beqaa region in eastern Lebanon. Hezbollah responded by reaffirming its commitment to continuing its strikes against Israel as part of its ongoing support for Hamas and Palestinians in Gaza. The group also vowed retaliation for what they termed a 'massacre' committed by Israel. The blasts caused chaos across Beirut, with hospitals overwhelmed by patients suffering severe injuries, particularly to the eyes and limbs. Lebanon's Health Minister, Firas Abiad, reported that several countries, including Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Egypt, had offered assistance in treating the injured. Medical supplies and equipment were flown into Beirut, including 15 tons delivered by an Iraqi military plane. Experts believe that the explosives were inserted into the pagers before they were distributed to Hezbollah, highlighting the sophisticated nature of the supply chain infiltration. The use of pagers, as opposed to mobile phones, had been a deliberate strategy by Hezbollah to avoid Israeli electronic surveillance. In the past, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah had warned of the dangers of mobile phones being used as surveillance tools.The post Taiwan’s Gold Apollo Blames Hungary for Exploding Pagers first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/gold-apollo-blames-hungary-exploding-pagers/	2024-09-18T02:26:30-07:00	
Hezbollah Vows Retaliation Against Israel After Deadly Pager Blas...	Hezbollah vowed retaliation against Israel on Wednesday after a coordinated attack caused hundreds of pagers used by its members to explode across Lebanon, killing nine people and injuring around 2,800 others. Among the dead was the 10-year-old daughter of a Hezbollah member. The explosions came shortly after Israel announced it was expanding its military operations to include Hezbollah, following Hamas's October 7 assault on Israel. 'We hold Israel fully responsible for this criminal act,' Hezbollah said, promising retribution for what they called 'sinful aggression.' In a further statement, Hezbollah reaffirmed their support for Gaza and vowed vengeance for the attacks. Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah is scheduled to address the public on Thursday. Lebanese Health Minister Firas Abiad confirmed the blasts killed nine people and left 200 in critical condition. Analyst Charles Lister speculated that the explosions were caused by small plastic explosives hidden with the pager batteries, possibly activated remotely. He suggested Israel's Mossad likely infiltrated the supply chain to carry out the attack. The incident has overwhelmed hospitals in Hezbollah-controlled areas. In one Beirut hospital, victims were treated in parking lots due to the influx of patients. In addition to the Hezbollah casualties, Tehran’s ambassador in Beirut was also injured, though not seriously. This attack delivered a significant blow to Hezbollah, particularly regarding the security of its communications network. A source close to the group reported that the pagers were part of a shipment of 1,000 devices believed to have been sabotaged before reaching Hezbollah. The blasts occurred just as Israel broadened its military objectives to include Hezbollah, having initially focused on Hamas in Gaza. Israel and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire since the October 7 Hamas attack, with casualties on both sides, including civilians and soldiers. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken returned to the region on Wednesday in a renewed attempt to push for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, with ongoing negotiations involving Qatar and Egypt. Meanwhile, the United Nations General Assembly debated a resolution calling for an end to Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories within 12 months, though Israel dismissed the draft as 'disgraceful.'The post Hezbollah Vows Retaliation Against Israel After Deadly Pager Blasts first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollaretaliation-israel-deadly-blasts/	2024-09-18T02:25:58-07:00	
Renowned Lebanese Novelist Elias Khoury Dies at 76	Lebanese novelist Elias Khoury, a passionate advocate for the Palestinian cause and a prominent figure in Arab literature, passed away at the age of 76. Known for his strong political views and commitment to freedom of expression, Khoury authored numerous novels and essays that voiced his criticisms of Middle Eastern dictatorships and Israeli policies in Palestine. Khoury had been battling illness for months, and despite frequent hospitalizations, he continued to write, often posting articles from his hospital bed. His work, which spanned five decades, made him a well-known intellectual across the Arab world. One of his most recent articles, published in July 2023, reflected on his experiences with pain and his admiration for the resilience of the Palestinian people. Throughout his life, Khoury stood firmly in support of the Palestinian cause, criticizing Israel’s occupation and settlement policies. In an article published just days after the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war on October 7, 2023, he described Gaza as 'the biggest open-air prison,' highlighting the hardships faced by its people. Born in Beirut in 1948, Khoury studied at the Lebanese University and later earned a PhD in social history from the University of Paris. He was actively involved in Lebanon’s civil war and sustained injuries during the conflict. In addition to his prolific writing career, Khoury edited the cultural sections of major Lebanese newspapers such as An-Nahar and As-Safir and served as the editor-in-chief of the Palestine Studies magazine. Khoury’s literary works, which include 'Little Mountain' and the widely acclaimed 'Bab al-Shams' (Gate of the Sun), explored the struggles of Palestinian refugees and the Lebanese Civil War. His novels have been translated into several languages, including Hebrew, and have earned him international recognition. Khoury also taught at prestigious institutions like New York University, Columbia, Princeton, and the University of London. Elias Khoury leaves behind a legacy of literature deeply intertwined with the region’s political and social history, offering profound insights into the human condition amid conflict and displacement.The post Renowned Lebanese Novelist Elias Khoury Dies at 76 first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lebanese-novelist-elias-khoury-dies-76/	2024-09-17T00:55:45-07:00	
Israel Stands Firm as Hochstein Warns Against Lebanon War	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told U.S. mediator Amos Hochstein on Monday that a 'fundamental change' is necessary after nearly a year of cross-border clashes with Hezbollah in Lebanon. Netanyahu stated that displaced residents from northern Israel cannot return home until the security situation significantly improves, and emphasized that Israel 'will do what is necessary' to safeguard its security. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant shared similar concerns with Hochstein, expressing that hopes for ending the conflict with Hezbollah are fading. Gallant underscored that Hezbollah, backed by Iran, has tied itself to Hamas and refuses to end its involvement, thus making military action the only viable option to secure the northern region. Gallant also conveyed this message in a phone call with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, warning that time is running out for a diplomatic solution. Hochstein, however, cautioned Israeli leaders that a broader conflict with Lebanon would not necessarily return displaced residents to their homes and risks escalating into a prolonged regional war. The U.S. remains committed to seeking a diplomatic resolution in both the northern sector and Gaza. Despite efforts by the U.S., Qatar, and Egypt to mediate a ceasefire in Gaza, there has been little progress in halting the fighting between Hezbollah and Israel. Hezbollah officials have indicated they would stand down if a Gaza ceasefire is reached, but Israel remains adamant that it cannot allow militants to operate near its northern border. The ongoing violence has killed hundreds, mostly fighters in Lebanon, along with civilians and soldiers on both sides, displacing tens of thousands. Hezbollah's deputy leader, Sheikh Naim Qassem, stated over the weekend that the group does not seek war, but warned that if Israel initiates one, there will be 'large losses on both sides.' Israel and Hezbollah last fought a month-long war in 2006, which killed over 1,200 people in Lebanon and 160 Israelis. Meanwhile, Israeli media reported possible tensions within the Israeli government, as Netanyahu is said to be considering firing Gallant, though Netanyahu's office has denied these claims. Gallant, a former general, has disagreed with Netanyahu over the post-war governance of Gaza, favoring a plan where Palestinian entities, supported by international actors, would control the territory, rejecting any long-term Israeli occupation. Netanyahu has also stated that the situation on the northern border is unsustainable, calling for a shift in the balance of power, though he did not specify how this would be achieved.The post Israel Stands Firm as Hochstein Warns Against Lebanon War first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-firm-hochstein-warns-lebanon-war/	2024-09-17T00:39:22-07:00	
Hamas Chief Vows Gaza Militants Ready for ‘Long War of Attrition’	Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar stated on Monday that the group is ready for an extended conflict with Israel, in a message directed at Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels, nearly a year into the Gaza war. He emphasized that Hamas has prepared for a prolonged struggle, which he believes will erode Israel's political resolve. Sinwar also expressed confidence that Hamas, alongside Iran-aligned groups in Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen, would ultimately prevail against Israel. This statement followed a missile attack on central Israel, claimed by the Houthis on Sunday. While the attack did not cause any casualties, it prompted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to vow retaliation. In his message to Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi, Sinwar praised the success of the missile strike, saying the Houthis had penetrated Israel's defense systems. He added that Hamas’s joint efforts with allies in Lebanon and Iraq would bring about Israel's defeat. Since November, the Houthis have been targeting Israel, claiming solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. These attacks, including missile and drone strikes, have disrupted international shipping off Yemen's coast. The Houthis, part of Iran’s 'axis of resistance,' have aligned themselves with groups like Hamas, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and several Iraqi Shiite factions. In July, a Houthi drone strike killed a civilian in Tel Aviv, which led to Israeli retaliatory strikes that caused severe damage at Yemen's Hodeida port, controlled by the Houthis.The post Hamas Chief Vows Gaza Militants Ready for ‘Long War of Attrition’ first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hamas-gaza-militants-ready-war-attrition/	2024-09-17T00:11:09-07:00	
Germany Reinstates Border Controls, Sparking Tensions with Neighb...	Germany has reinstated temporary border controls on its western and northern borders as of Monday, September 16, in an effort to combat irregular migration and cross-border crime. The new measures will apply for an initial six months to the land borders shared with France, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Denmark. Previously, similar restrictions had already been in place along the borders with Poland, the Czech Republic, Austria, and Switzerland. According to a report by Reuters, these controls are part of a broader government strategy aimed at addressing the recent rise in migrant arrivals. Flexible Border Checks by Police Germany's interior ministry announced that the Federal Police would carry out these checks with flexibility, adjusting their operations according to the current security situation. The goal is to minimize disruptions to daily commuters, travelers, and trade. The ministry advised travelers to carry valid identification, while non-EU citizens should have their visas and other required entry documents ready for inspection. The reintroduction of these temporary border controls marks another challenge to the free movement of people within the European Union. Criticism from Neighboring Countries Germany's decision has drawn criticism from neighboring countries. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk called for urgent talks with other affected nations, expressing concern over the potential increase in asylum seekers and the impact on trade. Austria’s Chancellor Karl Nehammer warned that if Germany began returning more migrants across their shared border, Austria would respond by redirecting more people toward the Balkans. Border checks with Austria are scheduled to continue until November 11, while those with Poland, the Czech Republic, and Switzerland are expected to remain in place until December 15. Impact of Border Controls These measures follow a backdrop of falling asylum applications in Germany, which have decreased by 21.7% in the first eight months of 2024. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser credited the decline in part to last year’s introduction of border controls, which prevented over 30,000 unauthorized entries. In a statement, Faeser emphasized the need for expanding the temporary border controls to cover all of Germany's land borders. 'This decision also aims to address the acute threat of Islamist extremist terrorism and serious cross-border crime,' she added.The post Germany Reinstates Border Controls, Sparking Tensions with Neighbors first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/germany-border-controls-tensions-neighbors/	2024-09-16T08:26:27-07:00	
US Media Reveals Suspect in Latest Trump Assassination Attempt	U.S. media have identified Ryan Wesley Routh, whom AFP interviewed in Kyiv in 2022, as the suspect in an alleged assassination attempt on Donald Trump. Routh, 58, was reportedly arrested after U.S. Secret Service agents fired on a man carrying an AK-47-style rifle near Trump’s Florida golf course, where the former president was golfing on Sunday. According to reports, Routh emerged from the shrubbery where he had been hiding and fled the scene in a black car before authorities apprehended him. Media outlets such as CNN and CBS described Routh as a self-employed affordable housing builder in Hawaii, with a criminal record spanning several decades. His online posts included political commentary, some of which were critical of Trump, the current Republican presidential candidate. One of Routh’s causes was supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russia's invasion. In a March 2022 post on X (formerly Twitter), Routh expressed his willingness to volunteer and fight in Ukraine, stating, 'I AM WILLING TO FLY TO KRAKOW AND GO TO THE BORDER OF UKRAINE TO VOLUNTEER AND FIGHT AND DIE&#8230; Can I be the example We must win.' The New York Times, which also interviewed him, cited this post. AFP had interviewed Routh in Kyiv in April 2022 while he participated in a demonstration supporting Ukrainians trapped in Mariupol. He was quoted as saying, 'Putin is a terrorist, and he needs to be ended, so we need everybody from around the world to stop what they are doing and come here now.' The U.S. has been a strong supporter of Ukraine since Russia's invasion began in February 2022. As the 2024 U.S. presidential election approaches, current President Joe Biden is set to be replaced by either his Vice President Kamala Harris, who plans to continue backing Ukraine, or by Trump, who avoided stating during a recent debate whether he supported Ukraine’s victory in the war.The post US Media Reveals Suspect in Latest Trump Assassination Attempt first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-media-suspect-trump-assassination-attempt/	2024-09-16T08:24:59-07:00
