Iran Accuses Israel of ‘Mass Murder’ Following Pager Explosions	Iran on Wednesday accused Israel of committing 'mass murder' following explosions of paging devices linked to the Tehran-backed Hezbollah group in Lebanon, which resulted in the deaths of nine people and injured nearly 3,000 others. Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Nasser Kanani, issued a statement condemning the incident, calling it a 'terrorist act by the Zionist regime' and labeling it an example of 'mass murder.'The post Iran Accuses Israel of ‘Mass Murder’ Following Pager Explosions first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/iran-accuses-israel-mass-murder-pager-explosions/	2024-09-18T02:27:18-07:00	
Blinken Arrives in Egypt to Push for Gaza Ceasefire	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Cairo on Wednesday in an effort to revive ceasefire negotiations for Gaza, a process made more difficult by recent explosions targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon. This marked Blinken's 10th trip to the Middle East since the Gaza conflict began nearly a year ago. During his visit, he met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and planned a press conference with Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty. However, there are no plans for him to travel to other Arab capitals or Israel. According to the U.S. State Department, the primary focus of Blinken’s visit was discussing the ongoing negotiation efforts with Egyptian officials. Although U.S. officials privately acknowledged they did not expect significant breakthroughs, Blinken aimed to sustain pressure for a potential agreement between Israel and Hamas. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller emphasized the importance of moving toward a deal without further delays, while avoiding any specific timeline for a proposal. The key sticking points include Israel's refusal to withdraw from the Philadelphi corridor on the Egypt-Gaza border and new demands from Hamas regarding the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. Blinken’s visit also came after explosions hit Hezbollah members' pagers across Lebanon, killing at least nine and injuring 2,800 others, an attack that Hezbollah blamed on Israel. Israel has not commented on the blasts, but had earlier stated it was broadening its war aims to include targeting Hezbollah. While in Cairo, Blinken is also expected to discuss strengthening U.S.-Egypt relations. Egypt, although frequently accused of human rights abuses, remains a key U.S. partner. Last week, Washington released $1.3 billion in military aid to Egypt without imposing rights conditions, unlike the previous year. After his Cairo visit, Blinken is scheduled to travel to Paris to brief officials from France, Britain, and Italy.The post Blinken Arrives in Egypt to Push for Gaza Ceasefire first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/blinken-arrives-egypt-push-gaza-ceasefire/	2024-09-18T02:27:06-07:00	
Nasrallah to Address Nation Thursday Following Pager Blasts	Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah is set to deliver a speech on Thursday, following a series of explosions involving pagers used by Hezbollah members across Lebanon. According to a statement released by Hezbollah on Wednesday, Nasrallah will address 'the latest developments' in a speech scheduled for 5:00 pm (1400 GMT). In response to the deadly explosions, which the group has blamed on Israel, Hezbollah reaffirmed its commitment to ongoing operations in support of Gaza. The group stated, 'This path is ongoing and separate from the difficult reckoning that the criminal enemy must await for its massacre on Tuesday,' referencing the recent attacks. The speech is expected to touch on these incidents and Hezbollah's continued activities amid the current regional tensions.The post Nasrallah to Address Nation Thursday Following Pager Blasts first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/nasrallah-address-nation-pager-blasts/	2024-09-18T02:26:41-07:00	
Taiwan’s Gold Apollo Blames Hungary for Exploding Pagers	Gold Apollo, a Taiwanese company, confirmed on Wednesday that it had authorized the use of its brand on the pagers involved in recent explosions in Lebanon and Syria, though the devices were actually manufactured by BAC Consulting KFT, a company based in Budapest. These pagers, which were primarily used by Hezbollah, detonated nearly simultaneously on Tuesday, leading to the deaths of at least nine people, including an 8-year-old girl, and wounding nearly 3,000 others. Hezbollah and the Lebanese government have accused Israel of orchestrating the attack, which appears to have been a sophisticated remote operation. An anonymous U.S. official revealed that Israel had briefed the U.S. after the operation's conclusion, stating that small explosives hidden inside the pagers had been remotely triggered. In a statement on Wednesday, Gold Apollo explained that while it allowed BAC to use its brand in specific regions, the design and manufacturing of the pagers were entirely BAC's responsibility. The AR-924 pager model, involved in the explosions, was known for its rugged build and long battery life, critical features in a country like Lebanon, where power outages are frequent. The attacks primarily targeted areas where Hezbollah holds significant influence, such as southern Beirut and the Beqaa region in eastern Lebanon. Hezbollah responded by reaffirming its commitment to continuing its strikes against Israel as part of its ongoing support for Hamas and Palestinians in Gaza. The group also vowed retaliation for what they termed a 'massacre' committed by Israel. The blasts caused chaos across Beirut, with hospitals overwhelmed by patients suffering severe injuries, particularly to the eyes and limbs. Lebanon's Health Minister, Firas Abiad, reported that several countries, including Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Egypt, had offered assistance in treating the injured. Medical supplies and equipment were flown into Beirut, including 15 tons delivered by an Iraqi military plane. Experts believe that the explosives were inserted into the pagers before they were distributed to Hezbollah, highlighting the sophisticated nature of the supply chain infiltration. The use of pagers, as opposed to mobile phones, had been a deliberate strategy by Hezbollah to avoid Israeli electronic surveillance. In the past, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah had warned of the dangers of mobile phones being used as surveillance tools.The post Taiwan’s Gold Apollo Blames Hungary for Exploding Pagers first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/gold-apollo-blames-hungary-exploding-pagers/	2024-09-18T02:26:30-07:00	
Hezbollah Vows Retaliation Against Israel After Deadly Pager Blas...	Hezbollah vowed retaliation against Israel on Wednesday after a coordinated attack caused hundreds of pagers used by its members to explode across Lebanon, killing nine people and injuring around 2,800 others. Among the dead was the 10-year-old daughter of a Hezbollah member. The explosions came shortly after Israel announced it was expanding its military operations to include Hezbollah, following Hamas's October 7 assault on Israel. 'We hold Israel fully responsible for this criminal act,' Hezbollah said, promising retribution for what they called 'sinful aggression.' In a further statement, Hezbollah reaffirmed their support for Gaza and vowed vengeance for the attacks. Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah is scheduled to address the public on Thursday. Lebanese Health Minister Firas Abiad confirmed the blasts killed nine people and left 200 in critical condition. Analyst Charles Lister speculated that the explosions were caused by small plastic explosives hidden with the pager batteries, possibly activated remotely. He suggested Israel's Mossad likely infiltrated the supply chain to carry out the attack. The incident has overwhelmed hospitals in Hezbollah-controlled areas. In one Beirut hospital, victims were treated in parking lots due to the influx of patients. In addition to the Hezbollah casualties, Tehran’s ambassador in Beirut was also injured, though not seriously. This attack delivered a significant blow to Hezbollah, particularly regarding the security of its communications network. A source close to the group reported that the pagers were part of a shipment of 1,000 devices believed to have been sabotaged before reaching Hezbollah. The blasts occurred just as Israel broadened its military objectives to include Hezbollah, having initially focused on Hamas in Gaza. Israel and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire since the October 7 Hamas attack, with casualties on both sides, including civilians and soldiers. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken returned to the region on Wednesday in a renewed attempt to push for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, with ongoing negotiations involving Qatar and Egypt. Meanwhile, the United Nations General Assembly debated a resolution calling for an end to Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories within 12 months, though Israel dismissed the draft as 'disgraceful.'The post Hezbollah Vows Retaliation Against Israel After Deadly Pager Blasts first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollaretaliation-israel-deadly-blasts/	2024-09-18T02:25:58-07:00	
Renowned Lebanese Novelist Elias Khoury Dies at 76	Lebanese novelist Elias Khoury, a passionate advocate for the Palestinian cause and a prominent figure in Arab literature, passed away at the age of 76. Known for his strong political views and commitment to freedom of expression, Khoury authored numerous novels and essays that voiced his criticisms of Middle Eastern dictatorships and Israeli policies in Palestine. Khoury had been battling illness for months, and despite frequent hospitalizations, he continued to write, often posting articles from his hospital bed. His work, which spanned five decades, made him a well-known intellectual across the Arab world. One of his most recent articles, published in July 2023, reflected on his experiences with pain and his admiration for the resilience of the Palestinian people. Throughout his life, Khoury stood firmly in support of the Palestinian cause, criticizing Israel’s occupation and settlement policies. In an article published just days after the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war on October 7, 2023, he described Gaza as 'the biggest open-air prison,' highlighting the hardships faced by its people. Born in Beirut in 1948, Khoury studied at the Lebanese University and later earned a PhD in social history from the University of Paris. He was actively involved in Lebanon’s civil war and sustained injuries during the conflict. In addition to his prolific writing career, Khoury edited the cultural sections of major Lebanese newspapers such as An-Nahar and As-Safir and served as the editor-in-chief of the Palestine Studies magazine. Khoury’s literary works, which include 'Little Mountain' and the widely acclaimed 'Bab al-Shams' (Gate of the Sun), explored the struggles of Palestinian refugees and the Lebanese Civil War. His novels have been translated into several languages, including Hebrew, and have earned him international recognition. Khoury also taught at prestigious institutions like New York University, Columbia, Princeton, and the University of London. Elias Khoury leaves behind a legacy of literature deeply intertwined with the region’s political and social history, offering profound insights into the human condition amid conflict and displacement.The post Renowned Lebanese Novelist Elias Khoury Dies at 76 first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lebanese-novelist-elias-khoury-dies-76/	2024-09-17T00:55:45-07:00	
Israel Stands Firm as Hochstein Warns Against Lebanon War	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told U.S. mediator Amos Hochstein on Monday that a 'fundamental change' is necessary after nearly a year of cross-border clashes with Hezbollah in Lebanon. Netanyahu stated that displaced residents from northern Israel cannot return home until the security situation significantly improves, and emphasized that Israel 'will do what is necessary' to safeguard its security. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant shared similar concerns with Hochstein, expressing that hopes for ending the conflict with Hezbollah are fading. Gallant underscored that Hezbollah, backed by Iran, has tied itself to Hamas and refuses to end its involvement, thus making military action the only viable option to secure the northern region. Gallant also conveyed this message in a phone call with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, warning that time is running out for a diplomatic solution. Hochstein, however, cautioned Israeli leaders that a broader conflict with Lebanon would not necessarily return displaced residents to their homes and risks escalating into a prolonged regional war. The U.S. remains committed to seeking a diplomatic resolution in both the northern sector and Gaza. Despite efforts by the U.S., Qatar, and Egypt to mediate a ceasefire in Gaza, there has been little progress in halting the fighting between Hezbollah and Israel. Hezbollah officials have indicated they would stand down if a Gaza ceasefire is reached, but Israel remains adamant that it cannot allow militants to operate near its northern border. The ongoing violence has killed hundreds, mostly fighters in Lebanon, along with civilians and soldiers on both sides, displacing tens of thousands. Hezbollah's deputy leader, Sheikh Naim Qassem, stated over the weekend that the group does not seek war, but warned that if Israel initiates one, there will be 'large losses on both sides.' Israel and Hezbollah last fought a month-long war in 2006, which killed over 1,200 people in Lebanon and 160 Israelis. Meanwhile, Israeli media reported possible tensions within the Israeli government, as Netanyahu is said to be considering firing Gallant, though Netanyahu's office has denied these claims. Gallant, a former general, has disagreed with Netanyahu over the post-war governance of Gaza, favoring a plan where Palestinian entities, supported by international actors, would control the territory, rejecting any long-term Israeli occupation. Netanyahu has also stated that the situation on the northern border is unsustainable, calling for a shift in the balance of power, though he did not specify how this would be achieved.The post Israel Stands Firm as Hochstein Warns Against Lebanon War first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-firm-hochstein-warns-lebanon-war/	2024-09-17T00:39:22-07:00	
Hamas Chief Vows Gaza Militants Ready for ‘Long War of Attrition’	Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar stated on Monday that the group is ready for an extended conflict with Israel, in a message directed at Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels, nearly a year into the Gaza war. He emphasized that Hamas has prepared for a prolonged struggle, which he believes will erode Israel's political resolve. Sinwar also expressed confidence that Hamas, alongside Iran-aligned groups in Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen, would ultimately prevail against Israel. This statement followed a missile attack on central Israel, claimed by the Houthis on Sunday. While the attack did not cause any casualties, it prompted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to vow retaliation. In his message to Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi, Sinwar praised the success of the missile strike, saying the Houthis had penetrated Israel's defense systems. He added that Hamas’s joint efforts with allies in Lebanon and Iraq would bring about Israel's defeat. Since November, the Houthis have been targeting Israel, claiming solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. These attacks, including missile and drone strikes, have disrupted international shipping off Yemen's coast. The Houthis, part of Iran’s 'axis of resistance,' have aligned themselves with groups like Hamas, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and several Iraqi Shiite factions. In July, a Houthi drone strike killed a civilian in Tel Aviv, which led to Israeli retaliatory strikes that caused severe damage at Yemen's Hodeida port, controlled by the Houthis.The post Hamas Chief Vows Gaza Militants Ready for ‘Long War of Attrition’ first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hamas-gaza-militants-ready-war-attrition/	2024-09-17T00:11:09-07:00	
Germany Reinstates Border Controls, Sparking Tensions with Neighb...	Germany has reinstated temporary border controls on its western and northern borders as of Monday, September 16, in an effort to combat irregular migration and cross-border crime. The new measures will apply for an initial six months to the land borders shared with France, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Denmark. Previously, similar restrictions had already been in place along the borders with Poland, the Czech Republic, Austria, and Switzerland. According to a report by Reuters, these controls are part of a broader government strategy aimed at addressing the recent rise in migrant arrivals. Flexible Border Checks by Police Germany's interior ministry announced that the Federal Police would carry out these checks with flexibility, adjusting their operations according to the current security situation. The goal is to minimize disruptions to daily commuters, travelers, and trade. The ministry advised travelers to carry valid identification, while non-EU citizens should have their visas and other required entry documents ready for inspection. The reintroduction of these temporary border controls marks another challenge to the free movement of people within the European Union. Criticism from Neighboring Countries Germany's decision has drawn criticism from neighboring countries. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk called for urgent talks with other affected nations, expressing concern over the potential increase in asylum seekers and the impact on trade. Austria’s Chancellor Karl Nehammer warned that if Germany began returning more migrants across their shared border, Austria would respond by redirecting more people toward the Balkans. Border checks with Austria are scheduled to continue until November 11, while those with Poland, the Czech Republic, and Switzerland are expected to remain in place until December 15. Impact of Border Controls These measures follow a backdrop of falling asylum applications in Germany, which have decreased by 21.7% in the first eight months of 2024. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser credited the decline in part to last year’s introduction of border controls, which prevented over 30,000 unauthorized entries. In a statement, Faeser emphasized the need for expanding the temporary border controls to cover all of Germany's land borders. 'This decision also aims to address the acute threat of Islamist extremist terrorism and serious cross-border crime,' she added.The post Germany Reinstates Border Controls, Sparking Tensions with Neighbors first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/germany-border-controls-tensions-neighbors/	2024-09-16T08:26:27-07:00	
US Media Reveals Suspect in Latest Trump Assassination Attempt	U.S. media have identified Ryan Wesley Routh, whom AFP interviewed in Kyiv in 2022, as the suspect in an alleged assassination attempt on Donald Trump. Routh, 58, was reportedly arrested after U.S. Secret Service agents fired on a man carrying an AK-47-style rifle near Trump’s Florida golf course, where the former president was golfing on Sunday. According to reports, Routh emerged from the shrubbery where he had been hiding and fled the scene in a black car before authorities apprehended him. Media outlets such as CNN and CBS described Routh as a self-employed affordable housing builder in Hawaii, with a criminal record spanning several decades. His online posts included political commentary, some of which were critical of Trump, the current Republican presidential candidate. One of Routh’s causes was supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russia's invasion. In a March 2022 post on X (formerly Twitter), Routh expressed his willingness to volunteer and fight in Ukraine, stating, 'I AM WILLING TO FLY TO KRAKOW AND GO TO THE BORDER OF UKRAINE TO VOLUNTEER AND FIGHT AND DIE&#8230; Can I be the example We must win.' The New York Times, which also interviewed him, cited this post. AFP had interviewed Routh in Kyiv in April 2022 while he participated in a demonstration supporting Ukrainians trapped in Mariupol. He was quoted as saying, 'Putin is a terrorist, and he needs to be ended, so we need everybody from around the world to stop what they are doing and come here now.' The U.S. has been a strong supporter of Ukraine since Russia's invasion began in February 2022. As the 2024 U.S. presidential election approaches, current President Joe Biden is set to be replaced by either his Vice President Kamala Harris, who plans to continue backing Ukraine, or by Trump, who avoided stating during a recent debate whether he supported Ukraine’s victory in the war.The post US Media Reveals Suspect in Latest Trump Assassination Attempt first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-media-suspect-trump-assassination-attempt/	2024-09-16T08:24:59-07:00
