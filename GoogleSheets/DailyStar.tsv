Iran denies funneling cash to Hezbollah via airport	Israel has accused Iran of pumping millions of dollars to Hezbollah through Beirut's Rafik Hariri International Airport. According to the allegations, Iranian diplomats and Turkish citizens have transported suitcases full of U.S. dollars in support of Hezbollah's activities in Lebanon. In turn, Iran and Hezbollah have denied the reports outright. Hezbollah described the reports as baseless, claiming they were part of a broader campaign to tarnish the group's image and provide a pretext for targeting Lebanon's infrastructure. The Lebanese government has also denied these charges, underlining that Beirut's airport is under the tight control of the Lebanese army, which would not allow any illegal activities, including transferring money or weapons to Hezbollah. As one high-ranking Lebanese security official said, smuggling large sums of cash is already hard because of increased security, but small valuable items might get through. The accusation has come in the wake of a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. Fears in Israel have been that such Iranian financing would enable Hezbollah to rearm and consolidate a powerful position in the region. Out of those fears, the report says that Israel has issued threats to attack Beirut Airport should that airport be used in smuggling activities. Yet uneasy, all parties continue to view with keen eyes as events roll on. Still tense, the world waits and watches how all these accusations and denials could make a potentially precarious Middle East balance even further precarious.The post Iran denies funneling cash to Hezbollah via airport first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/iran-denies-funneling-cash-hezbollah-airport/	2025-02-03T07:18:22-08:00	
Breaking: Latest government line-up revealed	Both Hezbollah and the Amal Movement have retained four ministerial positions in the new government, but they had agreed on the selection of a fifth in coordination with President Joseph Aoun and Prime Minister-designate Nawaf Salam, *Nidaa al-Watan* added. The point is, that fifth minister has not yet been agreed upon, yet Hezbollah and Amal insist that their suggestions regarding the selection of that minister should be taken into account. The parties have proposed the following for the Shiite cabinet representation: Yassine Jaber for finance, Nassif Siqlawi for industry, Tamara al-Zein for the environment, and Rakan Nassereddine for health. For the fifth Shiite ministerial post, Aoun and Salam have pre­lim­i­nar­ily agreed to pro­pose Lamia Moubayed, but Hezbol­lah and Amal insist they want to have their say in that matter. For the Druze community, two ministers close to Progressive Socialist Party, Nizar al-Hani for agriculture and Fayez Rasamni for public works are present within this formation. As for Sunni ministers, a consensus has thus far been made on Rima Karami for education, Hanine al-Sayyed for social affairs, Ahmad al-Hajjar for interior and Amer al-Bsat for economy; however, all Sunni allocation options are subject to change after MP Ahmad al-Kheir's scheduled visit at Baabda. President Aoun will appoint Naji Abi Assi as the foreign affairs minister, while a retired brigadier general will be appointed to the defense ministry. The Lebanese Forces have been granted key portfolios: energy, Joe Saddi; tourism, Tony al-Rami; and telecommunications, Kamal Shehadeh. Further, *Nidaa al-Watan* reports that the LF could also obtain a fourth ministry, which would likely represent the Greek Catholic community. Other key appointments include Tarek Mitri as Deputy Prime Minister, Ghassan Salameh for culture and Adel Nassar (Justice/Kataeb Party/Maronite). The Marada Movement has nominated Ziad Ramez al-Khazen for the information ministry while the Tashnag Party has nominated Maral Toutelian for youth and sports.The post Breaking: Latest government line-up revealed first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/latest-government-line-up-revealed/	2025-02-03T07:18:13-08:00	
Israeli army fires, detains fisherman as southerners march home	For the second consecutive Sunday, residents of southern border villages gathered in what they call return marches, demanding to re-enter their towns with the support of the Lebanese Army. From the early hours, crowds converged at the western entrances of Mays al-Jabal and Houla, calling for access to their homes. Despite the Israeli army opening fire on returnees in Yaroun and deploying a drone to drop a stun grenade, no injuries were reported. However, the situation remains tense, particularly following last Sunday’s incidents, when Israeli forces killed 24 people and wounded 134 others during similar demonstrations. In Kfar Kila, residents assembled at the passage separating it from Deir Mimas, urging for its liberation despite an Israeli military operation that saw more than ten homes in the town demolished in a controlled detonation. Meanwhile, the Lebanese Army entered Aitaroun as Israeli forces withdrew, allowing residents to follow and reclaim their village. However, Israeli troops still maintain a presence on the town’s outskirts. Demonstrators also marched toward Maroun al-Ras, raising flags on trees in defiance of the Israeli army, prompting soldiers to fire shots into the air. Similarly, in Adaisseh, locals gathered at the town’s entrance despite Israeli gunfire aimed at dispersing them. Separately, an Israeli naval patrol arrested a Lebanese fisherman from the Jahir family at Ras al-Naqoura while he was fishing with his brother. His brother was later released, but the detained fisherman’s fate remains unclear.The post Israeli army fires, detains fisherman as southerners march home first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-army-fires-detains-fisherman-southerners-march-home/	2025-02-02T08:01:19-08:00	
Gaza ceasefire marks smoothest Israeli-Palestinian captive exchan...	The truce in Gaza witnessed one of its smoothest hostage-prisoner exchanges on Saturday, as Israeli captives were released in return for Palestinian detainees. Meanwhile, the crucial Rafah border crossing reopened ahead of anticipated discussions on the next, more challenging phase of the ceasefire agreement. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to meet U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Tuesday, an opportunity for him to emphasize Israel’s stance and future plans following 15 months of war. The next phase of the ceasefire aims to negotiate the release of remaining hostages and extend the truce indefinitely. If no agreement is reached, hostilities could resume in early March. Netanyahu’s office confirmed that he spoke with Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, on Saturday evening. They agreed that negotiations on the second phase would commence at their meeting on Monday, with Witkoff also planning discussions later in the week with mediators from Qatar and Egypt. As part of the latest exchange, Hamas released three male captives, while Israel freed 183 Palestinian prisoners. Another exchange is expected next Saturday. The hostages—Argentinian-Israeli Yarden Bibas, French-Israeli Ofer Kalderon, and American-Israeli Keith Siegel—were handed over to Red Cross officials at different locations in Gaza. Their release follows the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, which sparked the war. With these latest releases, 18 captives have now been freed since the ceasefire took effect on January 19. Unlike previous releases, which saw chaotic scenes, Saturday’s exchange was more structured, with armed Hamas militants forming orderly lines as the captives were escorted onto a stage to wave to the crowd. The militant group has attempted to project control in Gaza despite the loss of key military leaders. Shortly after the exchange, a bus carrying more than two dozen Palestinian prisoners departed from Ofer Military Prison for the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The prisoners were met with celebrations, as crowds lifted them onto their shoulders in triumph. Some of those released appeared frail and visibly affected by their time in detention. According to Israel’s Prison Authority, all 183 Palestinian detainees set for release have now been freed. Among them, 111 had been detained after Hamas’ October 7 attack but were not directly involved in it. These individuals, held without trial, were sent to Gaza. Seven others, serving life sentences, were transferred to Egypt. Emotional Reunions and Lingering Uncertainty Siegel, a 65-year-old originally from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, had been taken hostage from Kibbutz Kfar Aza, along with his wife Aviva, who was freed during a previous ceasefire. Members of his kibbutz expressed relief and joy upon his release. His niece, Tal Wax, noted, 'He’s lost a lot of weight, but he’s walking, talking, and he’s still himself. One of the first things he said was that he’s still vegan.' The release of 35-year-old Bibas brought renewed focus on the fate of his wife, Shiri, and their two sons, Ariel and Kfir, who were 4 years old and 9 months old at the time of their capture from Kibbutz Nir Oz. Kfir, the youngest of the approximately 250 people abducted, became a symbol of Israeli anger and helplessness. Hamas has claimed that Shiri and her sons were killed in an Israeli airstrike, but Israel has yet to confirm this. Israeli officials have expressed grave concern over their fate. Upon reuniting with his family, Bibas closed his eyes as his father, Eli, and sister, Ofri, embraced him in tears. His father whispered, 'Sweetheart.' The Bibas family later released a statement saying, 'A quarter of our heart has returned to us.' Kalderon, 54, who was also taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz, was reunited with his children, Erez and Sahar, who had been released in a previous ceasefire. 'I am here. I didn’t give up,' Kalderon told them as they embraced. The Palestinian detainees released also shared emotional moments with their families. Some expressed mixed feelings of sadness and joy, knowing that many of their fellow detainees remain behind bars. Mohammad Kaskus, who had been serving a 25-year sentence for attacks against Israelis, remarked, 'It’s an indescribable feeling, but we cannot forget our brothers still imprisoned.' For Yaser Abu Hamad, arrested in 2006 for his involvement with the Islamic Jihad militant group, the return home was bittersweet. He discovered that 20 of his family members, including his mother and sisters, had been killed in Israeli airstrikes. His first act after release was visiting their graves. Several former detainees described experiencing harsh conditions in Israeli prisons, including physical abuse. The Israeli Prison Authority has not responded to these allegations. A Temporary Respite for Gaza The ceasefire, now two weeks old, has facilitated the entry of hundreds of aid trucks into Gaza and allowed many Palestinians to return to their devastated homes in the northern part of the enclave. In a further sign of de-escalation, 50 sick and wounded Palestinian children were granted permission to leave Gaza for medical treatment through the Rafah border crossing into Egypt. This marked the first time the crossing had been opened since Israel took control of it nine months ago. During the initial six-week phase of the ceasefire, 33 Israeli captives are set to be exchanged for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israel has confirmed that Hamas provided information indicating that eight of those hostages are dead. About 80 captives remain in Gaza. Naama Weinberg, cousin of deceased captive Itay Svirsky, addressed both sides of the conflict at a weekly gathering in Tel Aviv, saying, 'We will not allow you to blow up this deal. We will not allow you to force us back into war or to sentence the captives left behind to death.' The Road Ahead: More Talks, Uncertain Outcomes Despite the temporary ceasefire, Israel remains committed to dismantling Hamas, while the militant group insists it will not release the remaining hostages without an end to the war and a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The initial October 7 attack, which ignited the war, reportedly resulted in around 1,200 deaths in southern Israel. Since then, Israel’s air and ground offensive has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, including a significant number of women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The Israeli military claims it has killed over 17,000 militants, though it has not provided evidence for this figure. Israel continues to blame Hamas for civilian casualties, arguing that the group operates from within residential areas. As negotiations for the next phase of the ceasefire loom, both sides remain deeply entrenched in their positions. If a new agreement is not reached, hostilities could resume by early March.The post Gaza ceasefire marks smoothest Israeli-Palestinian captive exchange yet first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/gaza-ceasefire-smoothest-israeli-palestinian-exchange-yet/	2025-02-02T08:01:13-08:00	
Two hostages freed, return to Israel after Gaza handover	The ongoing ceasefire in Gaza has allowed for the release of hostages, with two Israeli captives arriving back in Israel on Saturday after being handed over by Hamas to the Red Cross. This marks the fourth exchange of hostages under the truce agreement, with dozens of Palestinian prisoners expected to be freed from Israeli detention in return. The ceasefire, which began on January 19, has temporarily paused hostilities in the deadliest conflict between Israel and Hamas. The truce has not only halted fighting but has also facilitated increased humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza. Among those released were 35-year-old Yarden Bibas and 54-year-old French-Israeli Ofer Kalderon, both of whom were abducted during the Hamas-led incursion into Israel on October 7, 2023. After their release, they were transported to a military reception center, where groups of supporters lined the roads waving Israeli flags. Their handover was conducted in Khan Younis, where Hamas militants oversaw the transfer in an orderly manner, a stark contrast to the chaotic scene of a previous hostage release that had angered Israeli officials. Another captive, 65-year-old American-Israeli Keith Siegel, is also set to be released later, with arrangements in place for his transfer in Gaza City. Under the ceasefire's initial six-week phase, 33 Israeli hostages are scheduled for release in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. However, Israeli authorities report that Hamas has informed them that eight of those hostages were either killed during the October 7 attack or have died in captivity. The agreement also includes provisions for the evacuation of wounded Palestinians. On Saturday, several injured civilians were expected to cross into Egypt through the Rafah border, which had been closed by Israel in May. A European Union mission had arrived the day before to prepare for the crossing’s reopening. The first phase of the truce also aims to facilitate the return of displaced Palestinians to northern Gaza and expand humanitarian assistance to the war-ravaged region. According to Gaza’s Health Ministry, 50 sick and wounded children, along with 61 accompanying family members, were scheduled to leave through Rafah. In Israel, Bibas' release has renewed focus on the fate of his wife, Shiri, and their two young sons, all of whom were taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the October attack. A widely circulated video showed Shiri carrying their red-haired children—four-year-old Ariel and nine-month-old Kfir—wrapped in a blanket as they were taken captive. Kfir was the youngest of approximately 250 people abducted that day, and his situation has become a symbol of Israeli distress over the hostage crisis. Hamas has claimed that Shiri and her sons were killed in an Israeli airstrike, though Israeli officials have not confirmed this. However, a military spokesperson recently acknowledged that their fate remains uncertain. Bibas was reportedly held separately from his family, and images from his abduction suggest he was injured at the time. Kalderon, who was also taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz, was welcomed home by his family in Kfar Saba, north of Tel Aviv. His children, Erez and Sahar, who were abducted alongside him, had been freed in an earlier ceasefire in November 2023. Their relatives expressed relief at their reunion, with one family member stating, 'We will soon be whole again.' Keith Siegel, originally from North Carolina, was taken hostage from Kibbutz Kfar Aza along with his wife, Aviva, who was freed in November. Since then, she has led an active campaign advocating for the release of remaining captives, including her husband. Meanwhile, Israel plans to release dozens of Palestinian prisoners as part of Saturday’s exchange, including individuals serving extended or life sentences. During a previous ceasefire in November 2023, over 100 hostages were freed, but around 80 remain in Gaza, with Israeli officials estimating that at least a third of them are no longer alive. Hamas has confirmed that eight of the 33 hostages scheduled for release in this phase are deceased. Negotiations are set to begin next week for a second phase of the truce, which aims to secure the release of remaining hostages and possibly extend the ceasefire. However, if no agreement is reached, hostilities could resume by early March. Israel maintains that it remains committed to dismantling Hamas, even as the group has reasserted its control over Gaza following the truce. Some members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition, particularly from far-right factions, are pushing for an immediate resumption of military operations. Hamas, on the other hand, insists it will not release additional hostages unless there is a complete cessation of the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The war erupted on October 7 when Hamas launched an unprecedented attack that killed approximately 1,200 people, mostly civilians. In response, Israel’s military campaign has resulted in the deaths of over 47,000 Palestinians, with more than half being women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. While the Israeli military claims to have eliminated over 17,000 Hamas fighters, it has not provided independent verification of these figures. Israeli officials also attribute the high civilian death toll to Hamas' practice of operating within densely populated areas.The post Two hostages freed, return to Israel after Gaza handover first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/two-hostages-freed-return-israel-gaza-handover/	2025-02-01T10:29:24-08:00	
US claims killing senior al-Qaeda operative in Syria strike	The U.S. military confirmed that a senior operative from Al-Qaeda’s Syria branch was killed in an airstrike on northwestern Syria on Thursday. The targeted strike took place in an area that was once controlled by interim president Ahmad al-Sharaa’s group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), before it led the offensive that resulted in the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in December. According to a statement from U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), the operation successfully eliminated Mohammad Salah al-Zabir, a high-ranking figure within Hourras al-Din, an Al-Qaeda affiliate. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, reported that Zabir was traveling along the Sarmada-Idlib road when his vehicle was struck by a U.S. drone. This attack came just days after Hourras al-Din announced its dissolution, a move that was reportedly taken in compliance with orders from the interim leadership. The Observatory noted that the group disbanded to avoid direct confrontation with HTS, which had previously been Al-Qaeda’s Syrian affiliate until it severed ties with the global jihadist network in 2016. Hourras al-Din was founded in February 2018, according to the U.S.-based SITE Intelligence Group, but it only officially acknowledged its ties to Al-Qaeda in its recent dissolution statement. The United States designated Hourras al-Din as a terrorist organization in 2019 and had previously offered financial rewards for information on its key members. Over the past year, Washington conducted multiple airstrikes against the group’s leadership in northwestern Syria, including targeted operations in August and September. Despite continuing to classify HTS as a terrorist organization, the U.S. has eased some of its sanctions on the group following its role in toppling Assad’s government.The post US claims killing senior al-Qaeda operative in Syria strike first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-killing-al-qaeda-operative-syria-strike/	2025-02-01T10:29:09-08:00	
Hochstein’s successor visits Lebanon, demands inspection of 30 ‘H...	Arriving in Lebanon Thursday for her maiden visit as the new U.S. Deputy Special Envoy for the Middle East, replacing Amos Hochstein, was Morgan Ortagus. Ortagus commenced a tour of inspections with a visit to the US Embassy, where she received from US Major General Jasper Jeffers, chairman of the ceasefire monitoring committee, briefings about what the committee's missions were observing on the field. The pro-Hezbollah newspaper Al-Akhbar quoted sources as saying that Ortagus and Jeffers agreed on the start of a serious program of cooperation with the Lebanese Army. It will cover inspections of some 30 suspected Hezbollah sites north of the Litani River, notably in the al-Zahrani and Bekaa regions. The Lebanese Army Command reportedly was informed that the intelligence shows Hezbollah is hiding weapons and ammunition in buildings, storage facilities, valleys, and forests—claims allegedly based on information provided by Israel. Al-Akhbar further reported that U.S. officials are demanding the appointments of specific individuals to Lebanon's military and security apparatuses. They are seeking to see individuals at key junctures who will support their interpretation of the ceasefire agreement and have no links to Hezbollah. The sources that the newspaper cited, claimed that Ortagus would put pressure on Lebanese heads for the approval of these appointments. Washington, in coordination with France, is reportedly seeking officers to its liking with the aim of preventing further local uprisings and facilitating the Lebanese Army's deployment in the affected areas.

Geagea insists all parties join government, rejects finance for S...	In a press meeting on Friday, the Lebanese Forces leader, Samir Geagea, was keen to underline the dividing line between responsible political parties and those acting irresponsibly. He believed that all political parties should not be regarded as equal, and doing so would definitely nullify the very meaning of political governance. Geagea commented on an ongoing debate going on, with whether the newly appointed Prime Minister Nawaf Salam should name political parties through the new government. He definitely rejected the proposals to exclude all parties from this government, ensuring most of the political systems on earth were supported by parties which could not be omitted in governance even as no one political faction ever had exclusive privilege over any designated ministerial heading. He also renounced the principle of a common criterion for all, stating that it was not appropriate to put the ones who dragged Lebanon into conflict on par with others. As for the role of the Shiite Duo in the government, Geagea went on to explain that he does not object to allocating the finance ministry to a Shiite figure, but this should not be given to a representative of Hezbollah or the Amal Movement. He concluded by emphasizing that the country needs an efficient and active government-one that works to serve the aspirations of the Lebanese people.The post Geagea insists all parties join government, rejects finance for Shiite Duo first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/geagea-all-parties-join-government-rejects-finance-shiite-duo/	2025-01-31T09:20:20-08:00	
Ex-al Qaeda member appointed Syria’s transitional president	Ahmad al-Sharaa, previously known as Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, is now going to take over the presidency of Syria in what is an unexpected new chapter for the country. He has been propelled into leadership after a protracted war that saw the demise of Bashar al-Assad's regime, who ruled for decades. The statement was given by Hassan Abdel Ghani, the spokesman for the Syria Military Operations Command, who said Al-Sharaa would be head of state during the transitional period. He will represent Syria in international forums and will oversee the restructuring of the nation. Among his first tasks is to form a temporary legislative council to serve until a permanent constitution is drafted and implemented. The new command has introduced several measures as part of the transition that include suspending Syria's constitution, dissolving parliament, and disbanding the former regime's military forces and the ruling Baath Party. Al-Sharaa's leadership is the result of his role in leading the main militant group that played a central part in the offensive that ultimately led to Assad's downfall. But the task he must now accomplish is to rebuild a country that has been torn apart by over a decade of conflict. A 2011 uprising during the protests of the Arab Spring turned into an all-out war; regional and global powers, including Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United States, and Russia, ended up involved. The instability also provided an opportunity for extremist groups like ISIS to establish a presence in the country. Before his appointment, Al-Sharaa, to his credit, did acknowledge that the former regime left huge challenges, including what he termed deep societal, economic, and political wounds. He had said rebuilding Syria would require wisdom, dedication, and relentless struggle. He even showed nationalistic duty, indicating that just like his forces were fighting to liberate their country, so equally were they committed to rebuilding it. Who is Ahmad al-Sharaa? Ahmad al-Sharaa comes from a background of militancy. In his early twenties, he traveled to Iraq as a foreign fighter to fight against the U.S. invasion in 2003. At the time, he was captured and transferred to Camp Bucca, a U.S.-run prison in Iraq where many future leaders of extremist groups were held, including members of what would become ISIS. He was released and took up arms against the Assad regime, starting a long career as an armed opposition figure. Backed initially by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who would later lead ISIS, he then formed Jabhat al-Nusra, or The Victory Front, an armed group whose allegiance lay with al-Qaeda. In 2016, he broke ties with al-Qaeda, rebranding his group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, and turning away from global jihad toward governance. Unlike the ideology of al-Qaeda, which advocated for a holy war across the globe, HTS focused on running territories in Syria, especially in Idlib province, where it provided primary services to millions. According to analysts, such as Aaron Zelin, a terrorism scholar who studied HTS in depth, the group tried to establish itself as a political authority rather than purely a militant organization. As appointed transition president of Syria, Al-Sharaa's challenge is that he will have to steer the country out of the ruins of war, the divisions in its midst, and into discussions with the international community on its future.The post Ex-al Qaeda member appointed Syria’s transitional president first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/ex-al-qaeda-member-syrias-transitional-president/	2025-01-30T01:32:50-08:00	
Israel confirms release of three Israeli, five Thai hostages in G...	The Israeli Prime Minister's Office has released a statement confirming the names of three Israeli hostages set to be freed from Gaza on Thursday. The release also mentioned that five Thai hostages are scheduled to be freed, although it did not release their names. These include hostages Arbel Yehoud, 29, Agam Berger, 19, and Gadi Moses, 80, among others. In addition to the release, the Israeli authorities also freed 110 Palestinian prisoners in the latest prisoner swap. Of these, 32 received life imprisonment, and another 30 are children, Hamas said. This is part of an initial phase in a ceasefire and hostage release agreement between Israel and Hamas that had originally envisioned the release of 33 Israeli captives. There have been two previous rounds of releases, with nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners to be freed by Israel under this first phase. Israeli government spokesman David Mencer said eight of the remaining hostages Israel was supposed to receive on Thursday were known to have died. The three identified for release on Thursday are thought to be alive, the Hostage and Missing Families Forum said. Yehoud, meanwhile, had been abducted with her partner from the Nir Oz kibbutz. Also from Nir Oz - which with a population of around 400 has lost or had taken prisoner over a quarter of its population since October 7 - came Moses, described as a retired grandfather and an agronomist. The chairwoman of Kibbutz Nir Oz, Osnat Peri, termed the imminent release an historic moment but asserted that the struggle was far from over. Of the 76 people kidnapped from their community, 29 remain in Gaza. She underscored that while the road to complete rehabilitation will be long, efforts at bringing all the people home will continue. Moses’ family expressed their joy at his expected return, thanking the Israeli public for their support. Meanwhile, Berger, a soldier, was taken from a military base near the Nahal Oz kibbutz. The Hostage Forum reiterated its commitment to ensuring that every hostage, both living and deceased, is returned home. Former Hostage Expresses Gratitude to Israeli Soldier The latest news of hostage releases comes after a former captive, Amit Soussana, gave an emotional thank-you to a fellow hostage, Liri Albag, for saving her life. Soussana, who was released during a short-lived ceasefire in November 2023, gave an emotional television interview in which she said Albag, 19, had convinced one of their captors not to kill her. In the first weeks of her captivity, Soussana was in solitary confinement, in which time, she said, her kidnapper raped her. In late October, when Israel launched a ground offensive, she was transferred to another location in Gaza, where she found four other hostages, among them Albag. She said the hostages quickly banded together and pegged one of their kidnappers as significantly more dangerous than the others. That man, whom Soussana described as a 'psychopath,' beat her mercilessly at one point, binding her hands and feet to sticks and hanging her upside down. Her kidnappers, mistakenly believing her to be an officer in the IDF, interrogated her in hopes of gleaning information. At one point, she was threatened at gunpoint, while other hostages were brought in in hopes of persuading her to confess. Albag, who seemed to hold some influence over their kidnapper, reassured Soussana that he was probably bluffing. But she asked Soussana if she wanted to leave a final message for her family. Soussana instantly understood that Albag was the only one who could communicate with their kidnapper and asked her to make it clear she was a civilian. She said Albag was 'a force' and one of the few people who had an exceptional capability to stand up to their kidnapper. After two weeks in their company, the women were separated, and Soussana was transferred to Hamas's underground tunnel network; many hostages had to stay imprisoned for more than 15 months.The post Israel confirms release of three Israeli, five Thai hostages in Gaza on Thursday first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-confirms-release-israeli-thai-hostages-gaza/	2025-01-30T01:32:34-08:00	
Several wounded, abducted as Israel escalates violations in south...	Israeli forces have conducted a series of operations in southern Lebanon’s borders, arresting three and wounding two in the village of Maroun al-Ras, sources in Al-Manar TV say. Apart from the arrests, Israeli soldiers shot at civilians and an ambulance at the village gate, Lebanon’s National News Agency (NNA) reports. A little earlier, a drone attack wounded civilians in the village of Majdal Selm, five confirmed Lebanon’s Health Ministry. The National News Agency added that Israeli forces remotely detonated an explosive device in Kfar Kila, creating a loud explosion heard in surrounding areas. Meanwhile, an Israeli drone shed a grenade over the village of Bani Hayyan. Elsewhere, an Israeli armored car approached al-Taybeh-Marjayoun highway, firing shots in the sky, and in Mays al-Jabal, an Israeli unit approached 100 meters towards a post of Lebanon’s Armed Forces at a western gate of a village. In the move, a bulldozer placed a barrier of sand in a street following a bypass of a position of a UNIFIL, NNA reports. The move took place under cover of a tank providing a cover of suppression, NNA reports. The Israeli forces also conducted widespread bulldozing operations, demolishing buildings and infrastructure in several villages, including Houla, Mays al-Jabal, Markaba, Kfar Kila, and Burj al-Moulouk.The post Several wounded, abducted as Israel escalates violations in south Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/several-wounded-abducted-israel-escalates-violations/	2025-01-29T06:33:16-08:00	
Syria demands Israeli withdrawal from Golan	Syria’s newly installed government demanded that Israel withdraw its presence in Golan Heights, a region it occupies for decades, in a move following its ally Bashar al-Assad’s fall. The demand during negotiations with Jean-Pierre Lacroix, head of U.N.’s peacekeeping, according to Syrian state media reports. The country’s willingness to cooperate with U.N. in full, according to its representatives, during Lacroix’s negotiations with its ministries of foreign affairs and defense, was reiterated during its negotiations with Lacroix. According to SANA, a state-owned television channel, Syria is ready to withdraw its soldiers to Golan Heights in compliance with a 1974 agreement creating a buffer zone, but only in case Israeli soldiers withdraw at a single move. The Israeli soldiers invaded the demilitarized buffer zone on December 8, when its ally Bashar al-Assad was overthrown, and took over its administration in a move seen in a similar form in 1981 when it annexed Golan Heights, a region it captured in 1967 during an Arab-Israeli war with its ally, Syria. According to terms in a 1974 disengagement agreement, a U.N.-patrolled buffer zone between Israeli and Syrian soldiers was drawn to divide them. Prior to even moving towards Damascus, loyalists of its administration long fled southern parts of Syria, a move that prompted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to refer to it as a 'vacuum at Israel’s doorstep.' The U.N. regards Israeli’s presence in the buffer zone a break in compliance with a 1974 disengagement agreement, and Lacroix’s tour included a sitdown with U.N.’s representatives in its Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF), responsible for checking compliance with an agreement. In December, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz instructed the army to make preparations for a prolonged presence in the security zone during winter. On Tuesday, he reiterated that Israeli forces will maintain a presence at sensitive locations, such as Mount Hermon and security zone, for a prolonged duration in a move to secure communities in the Golan Heights, in northern Israel, and in general in the region. Mount Hermon, shared between Syria and Lebanon, overlooks the Golan Heights and is a location of high strategic value. Katz reiterated that no hostile powers will maintain a presence in southern Syria's security zone.The post Syria demands Israeli withdrawal from Golan first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/syria-demands-israeli-withdrawal-golan/	2025-01-29T06:33:08-08:00	
Trump invites Netanyahu to White House on Feb. 4	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on February 4, Netanyahu's office has announced. It also underlined that Netanyahu will be the first foreign leader who will come to the White House in the second term of Trump. An invitation had been extended, one White House official said, adding that the timing of a meeting would be determined soon. This high-profile meeting comes on the heels of Trump claiming he had brokered a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, after months of failed negotiations. Once that ceasefire was implemented, Trump mentioned an idea of relocating the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip into neighboring countries such as Egypt and Jordan-a concept which has met fierce resistance by those countries, among several European governments. Through Trump's first term, he time and again vowed that Israel 'has never had a better friend in the White House,' while Netanyahu often delivered similar messages back. But things cooled between their friendship when Netanyahu congratulated President Joe Biden upon his 2020 presidential win. At the time, according to multiple reports, Trump privately-though wrongly-believing the election was stolen-accused Netanyahu of being disloyal. That is despite it because Trump resumed most of the lost ties with Israel within a day of commencing his second-term presidency. Reportedly, Trump signed a dispatch of 2,000 pound bombs to Israel, reversing yet another move-which the then Biden administration halted. In this regard, Netanyhahu thanked Trump through a statement wherein he hailed how Trump 'Equipped Israel 'with the power to protect.'.The post Trump invites Netanyahu to White House on Feb. 4 first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/trump-invites-netanyahu-white-house-feb-4/	2025-01-29T06:32:59-08:00	
Ceasefire extended to Feb. 18 as Hezbollah captive talks set to b...	The White House, in a statement dated January 26, said the ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon would be extended until February 18, 2025. There are also continuing negotiations with regard to Lebanese prisoners held by Israel since October 7, 2023. A United States-brokered truce in November 2024 had established the original ceasefire agreement to bring an end to the hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah. It called for the immediate 60-day withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon and the pullback of Hezbollah north of the Litani River. But as the first deadline drew near, the border grew more tense. On January 26, Israeli troops allegedly fired on Lebanese civilians trying to return to their homes in the south, killing at least 22 people and wounding many others. Israel blamed the incomplete deployment of the Lebanese army in southern areas as one of the main reasons for its delay in pulling out. The Israeli government is concerned that Hezbollah may regain access to those areas if the Lebanese military does not take full control. The Lebanese army has responded by saying it cannot deploy properly before the Israeli forces leave the region. Captive Deal to Be Discussed in Coming Weeks Along with the extension of the ceasefire, an agreement has been reached between the governments of Lebanon, Israel, and the United States to begin talks on the return of Lebanese prisoners captured after October 7, 2023. This is regarded by many as one step closer towards humanitarian needs and confidence-building between the parties. Although the extension of the ceasefire does, for the time being, prevent active conflict, the situation remains precarious. The international community remains attentive to reports of compliance with the terms of the ceasefire and developments in follow-up negotiations. Full implementation of these agreements is important for consolidating long-term stability in the area and providing the necessary guarantees for the voluntary return of displaced persons to their homes. The strike of the extension of the ceasefire to February 18, initiated with captive negotiations, is a cautious yet hopeful step toward peace between Israel and Lebanon. Continued diplomatic efforts and mutual cooperation will be required to navigate through the intricacies of the conflict in order for it to reach a lasting resolution.The post Ceasefire extended to Feb. 18 as Hezbollah captive talks set to begin first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/ceasefire-extended-feb-18-hezbollah-talks-begin/	2025-01-27T04:37:09-08:00	
Tens of thousands return to ravaged northern Gaza as Israel lifts...	Tens of thousands of Palestinians have begun returning home in northern Gaza, as Israel for the first time in 15 months lifted its closure of the area. Israel and Hamas are taking new steps to wind down a protracted conflict and facilitate the release of hostages under a fragile ceasefire sealing their weekend agreement. On Monday morning, teeming masses of Palestinians, carrying their belongings, poured through the Netzarim corridor into northern Gaza. It was a powerful reverse image of the mass exodus at the start of the war last October 2023. Many had been huddled in squalid conditions in tent camps and repurposed schools in the south, anxious for the green light to go home. But the euphoria of return has also meant coming to terms with the enormity of the destruction: tons of homes and infrastructure badly wrecked or reduced to rubble in heavy fighting. Yasmin Abu Amshah, a mother of three, walked nearly four miles to reach her home in Gaza City-only to find it still standing but damaged. She also was reunited with her younger sister for the first time in over a year and said the return was a happy one, despite the long journey. Ceasefire and Hostage Releases A ceasefire agreement with the release of hostages has helped the residents to return. Hamas has agreed to free several Israeli hostages, including civilians and soldiers, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The deal allows the return of displaced Palestinians to northern Gaza. This ceasefire, starting from January 19, 2025, aims to end the deadliest and most destructive war between Israel and Hamas. The ceasefire has brought a glimmer of hope in this never-ending saga, though the situation remains fragile. The international community is closely monitoring adherence to the terms of the ceasefire and the ongoing humanitarian efforts in the region. The return of residents into northern Gaza is a major step back toward normalcy, though rebuilding and recovery will take a long time and substantial support. The lifting of the closure in northern Gaza under the ceasefire agreement finally saw tens of thousands of Palestinians being able to head home. Every corner seemed to exude resilience and determination to begin this hard way of rebuilding among residents who practically saw everything torn to bits.The post Tens of thousands return to ravaged northern Gaza as Israel lifts closure under truce first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/tens-thousands-return-gaza-israel-lifts-closure/	2025-01-27T04:36:58-08:00	
Lebanese citizens make renewed push to return to southern border ...	People from South Lebanon escorted by the Lebanese army attempted to return to their villages on Monday, according to official reports and AFP correspondents, one day after Israeli fire killed 24 people in the region on Sunday. Reports said at least five people were wounded by Israeli fire on Monday in the areas of Houla and Bani Hayyan. Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati announced that Lebanon agreed to extend a ceasefire agreement between the militant Hezbollah organization and Israel until February 18. The extension came after the Israeli military failed to meet the deadline for withdrawal set for Sunday. Dozens of vehicles loaded with families were seen heading toward border towns Monday, a day after earlier attempts by residents to return to their homes in south Lebanon proved unsuccessful. In the village of Burj al-Moulouk, dozens of men, women, and children gathered behind a dirt barrier, some waving Hezbollah flags, as they hoped to reach the border town of Kfar Kila, where Israeli forces remain stationed. Sweets, water and pictures of Hezbollah's former leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, killed in an Israeli strike last month, were handed out by the party's backers to passers-by in Bint Jbeil, a major access point for border villages. Others passed out stickers emblazoned with phrases extolling what they described as a 'victory from God.' Women proudly carried around pictures of fallen Hezbollah fighters. The National News Agency said Lebanese army reinforcements reached the outskirts of the border town of Mays al-Jabal, where residents had started to congregate at the entrance to the town, ready to venture in alongside the military. It also said Israeli forces opened fire in the direction of Lebanese army troops near the town, without any casualties. In Houla, residents went inside after the army deployed in several neighbourhoods. The truce, which came into effect on 27 November, called for the Lebanese army to take up positions in the south alongside UN peacekeepers as the Israeli army withdrew completely within a 60-day period. That deadline expired on Sunday without the task being completed, with both sides accusing each other of holding up the implementation of the agreement. The ceasefire ended more than a year of hostilities, including two months of heavy fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. Earlier in the day, the Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee reiterated the calls on residents of South Lebanon to postpone their return. The Lebanese Army meanwhile said it would continue accompanying residents heading back and 'protecting' them against the anticipated Israeli attacks. Lebanon's health ministry said on Sunday Israeli forces opened fire on civilians trying to return to their villages, killing 24, including one soldier. The Israeli military countered that its troops fired warning shots to thwart what it saw as threats when some people appeared to be heading towards their positions.The post Lebanese citizens make renewed push to return to southern border villages first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lebanese-push-return-southern-border-villages/	2025-01-27T04:36:46-08:00	
US halts most aid, spares Israel and Egypt arms	The United States announced it was freezing most of its international aid programs with a policy change to exempt such recipients as military aid for stalwart allies including, amongst others, Israel and Egypt, in what the administration defined as an exercise of reorientation in America's priorities in foreign spending towards closer compatibility with its strategic interests. This shift in policy represents a watershed in U.S. foreign aid, with debate on what might be called a partial explanation for retaining aid for some countries while trying to rein it in for others. Israel and Egypt are exempt because they have long been viewed as vital to U.S. interests in the Middle East, having signed peace treaties with Israel. These countries receive immense military aid every year, with Israel receiving $3.8 billion on a 10-year memorandum of understanding and Egypt receiving $1.3 billion in military aid to help its counterterrorism efforts and maintain regional stability. The move by the U.S. government underlines its focus on preserving alliances with key partners in unstable regions. Israel is a critical player in the Middle East, with high-level intelligence-sharing and a linchpin for overall U.S. defenses in the region. Egypt has geopolitical significance because of its control of the Suez Canal and efforts to combat extremist groups across North Africa and the Sinai Peninsula. Although aid for these countries continued, the cutting of these other international aid programs was another movement of fiscal prudence and a rethinking of global commitments. The move attracted the ire of advocacy groups and diplomats who feel cutting off aid to developing nations will lead to humanitarian crises and lesser U.S. influence worldwide. This decision to focus on military aid, while cutting the other forms of assistance, has not gone unchallenged. Critics have questioned the long-term implications of abandoning humanitarian and economic development aid in less stable parts of the world. The cuts, they warn, may create vacuums that allow hostile powers like China and Russia to extend their influence. As the U.S. rebalances its foreign aid strategy, it continues to grapple with the hurdle of weighing national security interests against the role of global leadership by humanitarian means. The next few months will show how this shift affects America's relationships on the world stage and the stability of regions dependent upon U.S. support.The post US halts most aid, spares Israel and Egypt arms first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-halts-aid-spares-israel-egypt-arms/	2025-01-25T07:39:08-08:00	
Trump administration seeks extension for Israel’s Lebanon troop w...	In a new twist, the Trump administration has backed a temporary extension of the Israeli military sojourn in south Lebanon beyond the agreed-on 60-day withdrawal. This is in line with an earlier declaration by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that his country would not be able to meet the initial deadline since Lebanon was yet to fulfill the ceasefire terms. Background of the Ceasefire Agreement The truce, negotiated by the United States and France, went into effect on Nov. 27, 2024, with the stated goal of ending long hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah. Its major elements were the retreat of Hezbollah fighters north of the Litani River and the deployment of the Lebanese Army, backed by UN peacekeepers, to southern Lebanon. Israel was supposed to complete its troop pullout by late January 2025. Prime Minister Netanyahu has cited incomplete fulfillment by Lebanon of its obligations under the ceasefire as the main reason for the delay in withdrawal. He made it clear that the withdrawal of Israeli forces is conditioned on the complete and effective deployment of the Lebanese Army in the south, as well as the full withdrawal of Hezbollah forces beyond the Litani River. The Trump administration supports this extension, citing that Lebanese forces need to fully implement the agreement and protect Israeli citizens. A National Security Council spokesperson said that a brief, temporary extension would give the Lebanese government more time to uphold its obligations beneath the conditions of the ceasefire. Reactions are divided on the proposal for an extension. Hezbollah immediately rejected the idea, saying it would be a breach of Lebanese sovereignty and could lead to renewed fighting. But some international observers see a temporary extension as the means to ensure a smoother transition without creating a vacuum in south Lebanon. The situation remains fluid, with diplomatic efforts ongoing to balance the enforcement of ceasefire terms and the maintenance of regional stability. The international community is continuing to monitor developments closely, emphasizing that adherence to agreed-upon frameworks is important for lasting peace in the region.The post Trump administration seeks extension for Israel’s Lebanon troop withdrawal first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/trump-extension-israels-lebanon-troop-withdrawal/	2025-01-25T07:38:59-08:00	
Hamas announces release of four Israeli hostages tomorrow	Hamas has announced it will release four hostages from Israel tomorrow amid their ongoing negotiations, in a major step for the developing situation between Israel and the militant group based in the Gaza Strip. The announcement was made amidst a high-tension atmosphere in the region, along with sustained international pressure to take more humanitarian steps forward. The release is reportedly part of a broader agreement mediated by international mediators. While the details of the agreement remain undisclosed, this move is seen as de-escalation and an effort to make way for further dialogue. According to sources close to the matter, the names of hostages have already been communicated to Israeli officials and their families, bringing hope to those awaiting the return of their loved ones. A Step Toward Progress The announcement comes after weeks of frenetic negotiations between regional and international players. Qatar and Egypt are believed to have played pivotal roles in facilitating the agreement, leveraging their influence to mediate between the parties. These negotiations have also focused on securing humanitarian aid and addressing broader ceasefire conditions. While this news is a relief for the hostages' families, it also points to how intricate the conflict that continues on is. The release of hostages is often one of those emotional moments that bring into perspective the human cost of such prolonged disputes. Many hope this gesture will form the base upon which future agreements will be made to reduce violence and bring stability. Broader Consequences This move has received mixed reactions around the world, as, while others view it as a positive step toward peace, some restrain themselves, citing how fragile similar agreements have been in the past. The international community still calls for wider measures that will help bring about the necessary humanitarian response and find a sustainable solution to the conflict. With the release slated, all eyes now shift to the successful implementation of the release. Security is expected to be tightened as both sides would like to avoid any disruptions that may see the agreement derailed. Their release is a reminder of the complexity surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As much as this is a moment that should give some hope, it has brought to the fore the difficulties ahead in achieving lasting peace and security for all parties concerned.The post Hamas announces release of four Israeli hostages tomorrow first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hamas-release-four-israeli-hostages-tomorrow/	2025-01-24T09:11:43-08:00	
Netanyahu confirms Israel’s extended stay in Lebanon beyond 60 da...	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israeli forces will be in Lebanon longer than previously mentioned or a 60-day withdrawal. This is against the background of a continuing tense atmosphere in the region, with many questions being left to Israel's strategy in the long term and implications on regional stability. The first 60-day withdrawal plan was part of a ceasefire agreement in the hope of cooling off hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah. However, Netanyahu declared that operational complications and valid security apprehensions make the presence in Lebanon longer than initially announced. The prime minister reiterated that the security of every Israeli citizen and prevention of any threat to the people in future remains his priority. While the ceasefire agreement called for the Lebanese Army and UN peacekeepers to take over southern Lebanon, replacing Israeli forces there, the move reflects some suspicion that those forces are not yet ready or able to hold back Hezbollah activities. This was met with mixed reactions across the region. Lebanese officials seemed irritatingly puzzled by the now-extended military presence, which has been called a violation of sovereignty. Hezbollah has, however, condemned the move, terming it an act of aggression, and promising resistance in return. The international community, through the UN and key mediators in the deal to cease fire, all warned against violence, as many called on all sides to adhere to what had been agreed upon and to avoid further escalation. The longer stay reflects the complexities of the Israeli-Lebanese conflict. At the center of Israel's concern is the military build-up of Hezbollah. The influence of this group in southern Lebanon poses a real challenge to the fragile peace in that region. The extended mission is, therefore, to ensure Hezbollah does not get an opportunity to regroup for future attacks, according to Israel. Critics maintain that the presence may increase tension and make diplomatic efforts even more complicated. Events unfolding, both Israeli forces and regional players are watched on what comes next. The next weeks will be critical, which could either lead to further conflict or provide an opening for renewed negotiations due to the extended stay. This development underlines the urgent need for a sustainable resolution of the Israeli-Lebanese tensions, ensuring peace and security for all sides involved.The post Netanyahu confirms Israel’s extended stay in Lebanon beyond 60 days first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/netanyahu-israels-extended-stay-lebanon-60-days/	2025-01-24T09:11:06-08:00	
Hundreds flee Jenin camp after Israeli evacuation order	In recent development, the refugee camp of Jenin in the occupied West Bank has become a focal point of the big Israeli military operation. The offense has killed at least 12 Palestinians and injured more than 40, according to the Palestinian health ministry. Hundreds of residents have fled their homes in search of safety from the violence. Israeli Military actions in Jenin The Israeli Defense Forces have increased operations in Jenin with drone strikes and ground raids against what they designate as strongholds of militants. It is one of the largest military operations to have taken place in this area in recent times. This move by the IDF is part of an overall strategy aimed at breaking the militant networks operating within the West Bank, especially within areas like Jenin that have been pointed out as hotbeds for militant activities. The exacerbation has an impact on many aspects of life. The blockage of roads and military barricades has barred the Palestinian Red Crescent from gaining access to people injured during raids, while up to 600 individuals are trapped inside the main government hospital in Jenin as supplies dwindle and have very limited ways to access various vital services. The situation has prompted hundreds of residents to evacuate the Jenin refugee camp, seeking refuge in safer areas. While some reports indicate that Israeli forces issued evacuation orders, Israeli officials have denied mandating such evacuations, suggesting that residents chose to leave to avoid being caught in the crossfire. The heightened military activities in Jenin have been responded to by regional actors and international organizations. Jordan's foreign minister has warned that the situation in the West Bank may 'explode,' emphasizing that a comprehensive resolution of Palestinian issues must be found. Meanwhile, the United Nations has expressed its concern about Israel's expanding military operations, citing the risk of increased instability in the region. What happened in Jenin-as it still is-portrays the frailty of peace and security in the West Bank. Such military operations bear high humanitarian costs in the light of a civilian population always on the receiving end. As much as events are being watched by the international community in Jenin, there is an urgent call for dialogue and diplomatic efforts towards engaging in further de-escalation with a view to attend to the roots of such conflict.The post Hundreds flee Jenin camp after Israeli evacuation order first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hundreds-flee-jenin-israeli-evacuation-order/	2025-01-23T09:59:14-08:00	
Saudi crown prince pledges $600 billion US investment to Trump	In a deal that marked the depth of economic relations between Saudi Arabia and the US, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia announced an investment commitment of $600 billion to revamp strategic sectors across the United States. He reportedly made this commitment in a discussion with former US President Donald Trump, showing a bold vision for strengthening the ties of bilateral relations and the expansion of mutual economic interests. Key areas include energy, technology, infrastructure, and manufacturing-all reflecting the shared priorities of fostering economic growth and innovation. The investment plan also aligns with Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 initiative, a drive to diversify the Kingdom's economy and reduce dependence on oil. The United States will, in turn, likely experience an upsurge in job creation, modernization of infrastructure, and expanded technological advancement because of the injection of Saudi Arabian capital. This announcement, coming at a time when the uncertainty in the global economy needs international cooperation to be fostered, goes to show just how serious this Saudi Crown Prince is to position Saudi Arabia as a major global investment player. The decision signifies a continued partnership with the US despite changing political landscapes. Trump, who has made economic growth and private sector development the centerpiece of his presidency, praised the pledge in a statement, saying it was proof of the 'strong relationship' between the two countries and that it would create 'tremendous opportunities' for US-based companies to partner on major projects in Saudi Arabia. With this pledge, so much potential exists, but also many questions on how the money will be apportioned and how the timeline for implementation is going to work out. Observers will be closely monitoring the partnership's impact on both economies and how it aligns with broader geopolitical strategies. This will be a milestone investment that will represent a lasting relationship between Saudi Arabia and the United States, and a new era of cooperation and shared prosperity in years to come. And as more information emerges, the world will watch to see what this ambitious initiative does to shape the global economy.The post Saudi crown prince pledges $600 billion US investment to Trump first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/saudi-crown-prince-600-billion-investment-trump/	2025-01-23T09:59:06-08:00
