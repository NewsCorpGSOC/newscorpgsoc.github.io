Breaking: Hezbollah Clashes with Israeli Troops Attempting to Inf...	On Wednesday, Hezbollah reported engaging in combat with Israeli soldiers who attempted to cross into Lebanon, in addition to attacking Israeli forces stationed across the border. According to a statement from Hezbollah, their fighters thwarted an Israeli infantry unit that tried to enter the village of Adaysseh, engaging in a confrontation that ultimately forced the Israeli soldiers to retreat. Furthermore, Hezbollah claimed to have launched rockets and artillery at a significant Israeli infantry group located in Misgav Am, just across the border. They also targeted troop gatherings at three additional sites, using Burkan rockets in one of the assaults. In recent developments, Israel has intensified its bombardment of southern Lebanon since the previous week. On the same day, the Israeli military issued evacuation orders for more villages in southern Lebanon, following their announcement of initiating ground operations the day before.The post Breaking: Hezbollah Clashes with Israeli Troops Attempting to Infiltrate Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-clashes-israeli-troops-infiltrate-lebanon/	2024-10-02T02:07:47-07:00	
Israeli Strike on Damascus Kills 3, Including TV Anchor, Syrian S...	Safaa Ahmed, a prominent Syrian television anchor, was killed in an overnight Israeli strike on Damascus along with two others, according to a report by the Syrian state news agency SANA. SANA announced that Safaa Ahmed died as a result of what it called a 'treacherous Israeli aggression on the capital, Damascus.' The Syrian defense ministry reported that the Israeli attack, involving drones and planes, occurred around 2 a.m. local time from the direction of the Golan Heights, which Israel occupies. The ministry claimed that its air defense systems engaged the attacking missiles and drones, managing to intercept most of them. However, the strike resulted in three civilian deaths and injuries to nine others. Social media videos, which CNN geolocated, indicate that an explosion occurred near Syria’s Telecom building, located west of the city’s military airport. Another video showed a car ablaze following the explosion. It remains unclear if Ahmed and the other casualties were at this specific location when they were killed; SANA did not provide details on the exact location of their deaths. When approached for comments on these reports, the Israeli military did not provide a statement, maintaining their policy of not commenting on foreign media reports. For context, Israel has intermittently conducted airstrikes in Syria since the attacks by Hamas on October 7 of the previous year, typically without confirming these operations.The post Israeli Strike on Damascus Kills 3, Including TV Anchor, Syrian State Media Reports first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strike-damascus-kills-3-tv-anchor/	2024-10-01T02:55:00-07:00	
Analysis: US Influence Dwindles as Israel’s War Expands	Israel's anticipated military push into Lebanon marks a significant shift, underscoring a year-long conflict that reveals the diminished ability of the United States to control its ally or sway other key combatants in an escalating regional crisis. On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu advanced his campaign against Hezbollah with a so-called 'limited ground operation' in Lebanon. This action came despite prolonged pleas from Washington for Israel to show restraint and continued, albeit ignored, calls for de-escalation. This development occurred shortly after President Joe Biden expressed his support for an immediate ceasefire when queried about recent Israeli special forces operations in southern Lebanon. 'I'm comfortable with them stopping,' Biden stated. His remarks highlighted a growing rift between the U.S. and Israeli administrations. On the same day, Netanyahu boldly proclaimed to the Iranians in a televised message that 'Israel can reach anywhere in the Middle East.' This widening gap between the two governments aligns with the closing stages of a tense U.S. election, where Biden faces restricted political leeway to manage the war's domestic implications without causing further upheaval. This situation is something Netanyahu, who is adept at navigating U.S. political waters, is likely very aware of. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, has generally adhered to the administration's position, despite previous statements suggesting a possibly firmer approach towards Netanyahu and a focus on the hardships faced by Palestinian civilians.The post Analysis: US Influence Dwindles as Israel’s War Expands first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-influence-dwindles-israels-war-expands/	2024-10-01T01:28:59-07:00	
Israeli Strikes Kill at Least 13 in Gaza Refugee Camp, Health Off...	Late Monday night in central Gaza, Israeli airstrikes resulted in the deaths of at least 13 individuals and injuries to several others, as reported by health officials to CNN. The strikes targeted the Nuseirat refugee camp, causing these casualties, according to statements from officials at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital and Al-Awda Hospital in the region. CNN has contacted the Israeli military seeking their comments on the incident. These developments followed a report by Gaza’s Civil Defense stating that an Israeli strike on Tuesday had hit a school in northern Gaza that was sheltering displaced Palestinians, killing at least seven people and injuring others.The post Israeli Strikes Kill at Least 13 in Gaza Refugee Camp, Health Officials Report first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-kill-least-13-gaza-refugee-camp/	2024-10-01T01:28:53-07:00	
US Defense Secretary Talks with Israeli Counterpart as Israel Beg...	On Monday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had a conversation with his Israeli counterpart, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, discussing the recent security issues and Israeli military activities, as detailed in a Pentagon summary. During the call, Austin and Gallant concurred on the importance of dismantling the operational capabilities at the border to prevent attacks similar to those on October 7 against northern Israeli communities, as stated by Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder. The Israeli military has initiated a targeted ground operation in southern Lebanon aimed at Hezbollah, according to their reports. Additionally, when President Joe Biden was queried about Israeli special forces' actions in southern Lebanon, he expressed support for an immediate ceasefire, noting his readiness for the operations to cease. The Pentagon statement further highlighted that Secretary Austin assured the U.S. is ready to protect its personnel, partners, and allies against threats posed by Iran and groups supported by Iran. Austin and Minister Gallant also discussed the grave repercussions for Iran should it directly attack Israel militarily.The post US Defense Secretary Talks with Israeli Counterpart as Israel Begins Ground Incursion in Southern Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-defense-secretary-talks-israeli-counterpart/	2024-10-01T01:28:37-07:00	
UAE Pledges $100 Million Aid to Lebanon as UN Urges De-escalation	The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has committed to providing Lebanon with an aid package worth $100 million, as it raises concerns about the precarious situation in Lebanon and its implications for regional stability. This announcement was made by the state-run Emirates News Agency. The UAE's foreign ministry further expressed a strong commitment to Lebanon's unity, national sovereignty, and territorial integrity. The ministry underscored its continued support for the Lebanese people during these difficult times, as stated in a press release. This financial assistance arrives at a critical time, as the United Nations’ Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) highlights the severe impact recent conflicts have had on civilians in Lebanon. OCHA has called on the international community to actively support de-escalation efforts, ensure compliance with international humanitarian law, and prioritize urgent aid for those affected. The situation is further strained by the Lebanese aid sector's current challenges, as noted by the Lebanon country director of Relief International in a CNN interview on Sunday. He mentioned that the sector is struggling due to the displacement of approximately 1 million people in Lebanon following Israeli attacks. Additionally, the World Food Programme is responding to the crisis by initiating an emergency operation to enhance food support for up to 1 million people in need throughout Lebanon.The post UAE Pledges $100 Million Aid to Lebanon as UN Urges De-escalation first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/uae-100-million-aid-lebanon-un-urges-deescalation/	2024-10-01T01:28:15-07:00	
Hezbollah Rockets Strike Israel After Israeli Incursion Into Leba...	This morning, Hezbollah launched attacks on Metula in northern Israel, just hours after an Israeli military operation into Lebanon. Hezbollah confirmed that its forces had targeted an Israeli soldier assembly in Metula using artillery and rocket fire, claiming successful strikes on the targets. The group stated that these attacks were carried out to support the 'steadfast Palestinian people' in Gaza and to defend Lebanon and its inhabitants. In response, the Israeli military reported that it detected about five projectiles coming from Lebanon. Some of these were intercepted, and others were found in the vicinity, though the specific locations of their landing were not disclosed. Additionally, the Israeli forces intercepted two other projectiles in a separate incident. Air raid sirens were activated in the Bar’am area of northern Israel, where one projectile crossed from Lebanon and landed in an open space.The post Hezbollah Rockets Strike Israel After Israeli Incursion Into Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-strike-israel-israeli-incursion-lebanon/	2024-10-01T01:15:53-07:00	
How Will Iran React to Israel’s Escalating Strikes on Its Proxies...	Israel is intensifying its military operations against Iran-supported groups, including launching a limited ground invasion into Lebanon targeting Hezbollah and executing long-range strikes on Houthi forces in Yemen. These actions come amid growing concerns about a potential extensive regional conflict. Hezbollah, the Houthis, and Hamas, which initiated attacks on Israel on October 7, are part of the 'Axis of Resistance' backed by Iran, which includes various Islamist militias across Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Gaza, and Yemen. Over the past year, Hezbollah and the Houthis have frequently attacked Israel, pledging to continue their assaults until the conflict in Gaza concludes. Recently, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly criticized Iran. In a broadcast speech, he expressed solidarity with the Iranian populace, bypassing any intermediaries, and urged them to oppose their leadership. Netanyahu also reiterated his warning about Israel's capability to strike targets anywhere in the Middle East. A U.S. senior official disclosed to CNN that if Iran perceives a threat of losing Hezbollah in this conflict, it might directly intervene. The ongoing Israeli operations have significantly reduced Hezbollah's capabilities, removing hundreds of their fighters from the field. During an operation that eliminated Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah, a high-ranking officer from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp was also killed. In retaliation, Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has threatened Israel with severe repercussions.The post How Will Iran React to Israel’s Escalating Strikes on Its Proxies? first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/how-iran-react-israels-strikes-proxies/	2024-10-01T01:15:44-07:00	
Isn’t Israel Fighting Hamas in Gaza? Why Are Israeli Troops Now i...	Since the conflict in Gaza started last October after Hamas attacked Israel, Israel and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah have seen increased hostilities. Hezbollah has declared it will continue its attacks on Israel until a ceasefire is achieved in Gaza, which has suffered extensive damage due to Israeli airstrikes and ongoing conflict. Recently, Israel has shifted its military focus northward, setting a new objective to facilitate the return of displaced citizens to their homes near the Lebanon border. This adjustment comes after approximately 60,000 Israelis were displaced due to rocket attacks by Hezbollah. This has led to some of the most intense clashes between Israel and Hezbollah since the 2006 war in Lebanon, which resulted in around 1,100 deaths in Lebanon. Last month, Israel conducted a coordinated attack targeting Hezbollah, resulting in numerous casualties and severe injuries among thousands, including women and children, through the explosion of devices like pagers and walkie-talkies. Moreover, Israel has intensified its bombing campaigns in Lebanon, aiming at Hezbollah’s infrastructure and leadership. These bombings have not only targeted militant strongholds but have also destroyed residential areas and neighborhoods, particularly in southern Beirut, resulting in the deaths of several Hezbollah leaders and over a thousand civilians.The post Isn’t Israel Fighting Hamas in Gaza?

Lebanese Army Denies Reports of Withdrawal from Southern Lebanon	On Tuesday, the Lebanese military refuted claims that it had retracted its forces several kilometers from positions along the southern border in response to Israel's recent ground invasion into the region. The Army Command clarified that these reports were not accurate. It explained that Lebanese military units stationed in the south are merely adjusting the positions of some forward observation points within their assigned operational zones, not withdrawing. The army also confirmed its ongoing collaboration with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon to manage the situation. CNN has reported that it cannot independently confirm the movements of the Lebanese army. This response from the Lebanese military came after a Lebanese security source indicated to CNN on Monday that the army had vacated several observation posts along the southern border, relocating to nearby border village barracks.The post Lebanese Army Denies Reports of Withdrawal from Southern Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lebanese-denies-reports-withdrawal-lebanon/	2024-10-01T01:15:26-07:00	
Watch: Israeli Troops Launch Ground Offensive in Southern Lebanon...	Israel has initiated what it describes as a 'limited ground operation' in southern Lebanon, specifically targeting Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militant group. This marks a significant escalation in the year-long conflict, with Israel’s National Security Cabinet declaring this move as the 'next phase' of its war with Hezbollah. This is only the fourth time in nearly 50 years that Israeli forces have publicly entered Lebanese territory, the last being during the 34-day war in 2006. In preparation for the operation, Israel intensified airstrikes, which have killed hundreds and displaced around 1 million people in Lebanon. The most recent escalation came after Israel's assassination of Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, on Friday. The incursion is focused on dismantling immediate threats posed by Hezbollah near the border, but Israeli officials have been unclear on how long the operation will last or how deep into Lebanon their forces will venture. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant stated that Nasrallah’s assassination was a key move but that further actions were planned. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has resisted international calls for de-escalation despite growing civilian casualties in both Lebanon and Gaza. Historically, limited military operations declared by Israel have often evolved into more extended campaigns. This was the case with Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon in 1982, initially presented as a short mission to dismantle the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO). More recently, Israel’s operations in Gaza have similarly escalated beyond their original scope. In the lead-up to this ground operation, Israel’s National Security Cabinet greenlit the next phase of the conflict, while Israeli forces prepared by launching small raids and sealing off northern Israeli communities near the Lebanon border. Hezbollah has continued its attacks on Israel, aiming for a ceasefire in Gaza. Israel's military objectives have shifted northward, particularly after Hezbollah’s rocket attacks displaced around 60,000 Israelis. With rising tensions and the heaviest fighting since the 2006 war, concerns have grown that the conflict could spiral into a wider regional war. In the face of Hezbollah's losses, questions remain about whether its backer, Iran, will become directly involved in the conflict. Israeli leaders, particularly Netanyahu, have signaled that the war is part of a broader strategy to 'change the balance of power' in the Middle East. Iran has been involved indirectly through Hezbollah and other militant groups in the region but has refrained from direct conflict so far. Observers are concerned that any direct Iranian retaliation could potentially draw the U.S. further into the conflict. The U.S. has supported Israel's right to defend itself but has expressed concerns over 'mission creep' that could lead to a longer, more expansive military operation. President Joe Biden proposed a 21-day ceasefire plan, but it was swiftly rejected by Israel, highlighting the ongoing strain between Washington and Tel Aviv in managing the escalating crisis.The post Watch: Israeli Troops Launch Ground Offensive in Southern Lebanon: What We Know So Far first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-troops-offensive-lebanon-what-know/	2024-10-01T01:15:01-07:00	
Israel Declares Northern Border a 'Closed Military Zone'	The Israeli military announced on Monday that it had designated parts of its northern border with Lebanon as a military zone, ahead of potential ground operations. 'The areas of Metula, Misgav Am, and Kfar Giladi in northern Israel have been declared closed military zones, with entry prohibited,' said the military in a statement. This declaration does not necessarily indicate that Israeli forces will imminently enter Lebanon. Such areas can also be restricted if there is a perceived immediate threat. However, the Israeli army has significantly reinforced its presence along the Lebanese border in recent days. Commanders have stated they are ready to deploy forces if ordered by the government. Chris Coyle, a resident of northern Israel, noted that gates and checkpoints had been set up throughout the region, and numerous tanks had been stationed near the border. 'They’re definitely preparing to go in,' he observed.The post Israel Declares Northern Border a 'Closed Military Zone' first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-northern-border-closed-military-zone/	2024-09-30T12:18:19-07:00

This move comes in response to threats of an Israeli incursion targeting Hezbollah, following reports from the U.S. that Israel had notified it about conducting limited ground operations inside Lebanon. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that the army is 'repositioning and regrouping forces' in the region.The post Breaking: Army Repositions Troops on Southern Border Amid Israeli Incursion Threat first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/army-repositions-troops-southern-border/	2024-09-30T12:17:29-07:00	
Breaking: Israel Conducting Limited Operations Inside Lebanon	The U.S. State Department confirmed on Monday that Israel is conducting limited ground operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon. According to State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller, Israel has informed the U.S. that these operations target Hezbollah infrastructure near the border. On the same day, Israel's Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, hinted at the possibility of a broader offensive against Hezbollah, stating that Israel would deploy forces 'from the air, from the sea, and on land' as needed. This warning came as parts of Israel's northern border with Lebanon were declared a closed zone by the Israeli military. The escalation follows Hezbollah's low-intensity strikes on Israeli forces, which began shortly after Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, sparking conflict in Gaza. Since then, clashes along the border have intensified, with Israeli airstrikes inside Lebanon killing hundreds, including Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. Reports indicate that Israel has already launched small, precision raids across the border and may be planning a larger ground operation, while artillery strikes have been hitting southern Lebanese villages near the border.The post Breaking: Israel Conducting Limited Operations Inside Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-limited-operations-inside-lebanon/	2024-09-30T12:17:08-07:00	
Syrian Refugees Fleeing Lebanon, Returning Home as Conflict Escal...	Syrian refugees who once sought safety in Lebanon are now returning to Syria, facing an uncertain future. According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), around 100,000 people, including both Lebanese and Syrians, have crossed back into Syria to escape Israeli airstrikes. The bombardments have forced one million people to flee their homes in Lebanon, according to the country's caretaker prime minister. Lebanon is home to approximately 1.5 million Syrian refugees, the UNHCR reports. 'They came to Lebanon seeking safety, and now they are reliving that trauma,' said Rula Amin, the senior spokesperson for UNHCR in the Middle East and North Africa. Speaking to CNN’s Michael Holmes, Amin described the situation as 'tragic,' with civilians struggling to find refuge. Israel’s shifting targets in Lebanon make it difficult for people to identify safe areas to shelter. Although residents are advised to avoid Hezbollah-operated areas, the group's secretive nature leaves them unsure where to go. Without sufficient shelters, many are left sleeping outdoors, Amin added. 'We have never seen anything like this before, not even in 2006,' she said, referring to the scale and intensity of the bombings. The widespread attacks have resulted in significant civilian casualties, with Lebanese authorities reporting over 1,000 deaths. Amin noted that UNHCR staff stationed at the Syrian-Lebanese border are witnessing thousands of people fleeing into Syria each day. 'They don’t know what tomorrow holds. All they know is that they need to keep running,' she said.The post Syrian Refugees Fleeing Lebanon, Returning Home as Conflict Escalates first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/syrian-refugees-fleeing-lebanon-returning-home/	2024-09-30T06:33:22-07:00	
Israeli Minister Hints at Imminent Ground Invasion of Lebanon	Israel’s defense minister has provided one of the clearest indications yet that the country is preparing for a ground incursion into Lebanon. 'The elimination of Nasrallah is a significant step, but it is not the final one,' Yoav Gallant told Israeli soldiers on Monday. 'We will use every capability at our disposal, and if anyone on the other side doesn't understand what those capabilities are, we mean *all* capabilities, and you are part of this effort.' Gallant made these remarks during a visit to Israel’s armored corps near the Lebanese border, addressing soldiers from brigade 188 and the Golani brigade, an infantry unit. While Israeli officials have hinted at such a possibility before, Gallant's comments on Monday were more direct, signaling that Israel is moving closer to a ground offensive in southern Lebanon. Last week, Herzi Halevi, Israel’s chief of the General Staff, told troops near the northern border that airstrikes on Lebanon were intended to 'prepare the ground for your possible entry and to continue degrading Hezbollah.' Gallant further emphasized Israel’s commitment to returning citizens who were displaced from their homes in the north of the country due to the conflict. 'We are ready to take every step necessary to accomplish this mission,' he said. 'We will employ all necessary means—your forces, others, from the air, from the sea, and on land. Good luck.'The post Israeli Minister Hints at Imminent Ground Invasion of Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-minister-hints-invasion-lebanon/	2024-09-30T06:33:07-07:00	
Israeli Strikes in Gaza Have Killed 41,615 Palestinians, Health M...	As Israel intensifies its military actions across various fronts in the region, airstrikes in Gaza have continued without much respite. According to Gaza's Ministry of Health, Israeli strikes have claimed the lives of at least 20 Palestinians and injured 108 others over the past 24 hours. The ministry further reported that the total death toll has reached at least 41,615, with 96,359 people wounded since the conflict began. Rescue efforts are hampered by the destruction, with many victims still trapped under debris or stranded on roads, which emergency services are unable to access. The Government Media Office in Gaza estimates that around 10,000 people remain missing and are believed to be buried beneath the rubble. Relief workers have previously informed CNN that damaged infrastructure from Israeli strikes is obstructing efforts to reach survivors. CNN has not independently verified the figures provided by the health ministry, which does not differentiate between civilian and combatant casualties.The post Israeli Strikes in Gaza Have Killed 41,615 Palestinians, Health Ministry Reports first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strikes-gaza-killed-41615-palestinians/	2024-09-30T06:32:49-07:00	
Saudi Arabia Demands Respect for Lebanon’s Sovereignty	Saudi Arabia voiced its 'deep concern' on Monday regarding the escalating conflict in Lebanon, urging that the 'sovereignty and territorial integrity' of the country be upheld. In a statement from the foreign ministry, Saudi Arabia said, 'The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is closely monitoring the situation in the Republic of Lebanon with great concern.' Following reports from Lebanon's health ministry that over a hundred people were killed by Israeli airstrikes on Sunday, Riyadh emphasized the importance of respecting Lebanon's sovereignty. 'The Kingdom calls on the international community to fulfill its responsibilities in maintaining regional peace and security, to protect the region and its people from the devastation of wars,' the statement continued. Israel has been conducting lethal airstrikes in Lebanon for several days, culminating in the death of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Iran-backed Hezbollah, along with other senior members of the group on Friday. As tensions escalate, there are increasing international calls for Israel to show restraint, with concerns mounting over the potential for a full-scale war in the Middle East as Israel prepares for a possible ground offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon.The post Saudi Arabia Demands Respect for Lebanon’s Sovereignty first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/saudi-arabia-respect-lebanons-sovereignty/	2024-09-30T06:32:11-07:00

French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot met with Maronite Patriarch Beshara al-Rahi on Monday, highlighting the urgency of electing a new president in Lebanon and calling for an end to the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, according to a Bkirki spokesperson. Barrot arrived in Lebanon on Sunday evening, making him the first senior foreign official to visit since the escalation of Israeli air strikes. In a meeting with caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati, Barrot conveyed France’s call for 'an immediate halt' to the Israeli strikes. On Monday, he is also scheduled to meet with key Lebanese leaders, including Army Chief Joseph Aoun and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri. France Delivers 12 Tons of Medical Aid to Lebanon France has provided 12 tons of medical supplies to Lebanon, which includes two mobile clinics capable of treating 1,000 critically injured patients currently in hospitals across the country, according to a statement from the French Foreign Ministry. Additionally, French military aircraft have delivered vital medicine to Lebanese emergency, pediatric, and general hospitals and clinics, many of which have been overwhelmed by the influx of injured people since Israel's bombardment began over a week ago. During his visit to Beirut, Barrot announced that France would allocate 10 million euros ($11.1 million) in emergency humanitarian aid to support local organizations, especially the Lebanese Red Cross. 'In the midst of the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, France stands in solidarity with Lebanon and remains committed to protecting civilians,' the statement read.The post France Pledges $11M in Emergency Aid to Lebanon During FM’s Beirut Visit first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/france-11m-emergency-aid-lebanon/	2024-09-30T06:29:54-07:00	
Israel Reportedly Rejects Ceasefire Proposal	Israel announced on Monday that it has rejected a ceasefire proposal with Hezbollah, which had been presented by mediators during recent discussions. According to Al-Hurra's correspondent in Tel Aviv, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz held talks with various foreign ministers following the assassination of Hezbollah Secretary-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. The ceasefire plan was among the topics discussed, but Katz made it clear that Israel would not agree to such a ceasefire in Lebanon. As reported by the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation, Katz communicated this position to more than 25 foreign ministers, including those from Germany, Britain, Italy, and Canada. He stated that Israel would only consider a ceasefire if Hezbollah is pushed north of the Litani River and disarmed. Katz explained that 'the full implementation of all U.N. Security Council resolutions related to Lebanon' is the only pathway to a ceasefire. Until that happens, Israel would continue its military operations to ensure the security of its citizens and allow residents in the northern regions to safely return to their homes. He also defended the assassination of Nasrallah, calling it one of the most justified actions Israel has undertaken, adding that Nasrallah had been planning further attacks against Israel. Katz further warned Iran, saying that any attack from Iran would be met with a retaliatory strike by Israel. Meanwhile, European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell expressed regret last Friday over the lack of influence to 'stop' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s actions in Gaza and Lebanon. Borrell stated, 'We are applying all diplomatic pressure to halt the fighting, but no one seems able to stop Netanyahu, whether in Gaza or the West Bank.' Borrell voiced support for a French and U.S.-led initiative calling for a 21-day ceasefire in Lebanon, but Israel has disregarded the proposal, continuing to intensify its strikes in the country.The post Israel Reportedly Rejects Ceasefire Proposal first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-reportedly-rejects-ceasefire-proposal/	2024-09-30T06:09:35-07:00	
EU Calls Emergency Talks on Lebanon Escalation	European foreign ministers are set to hold emergency talks on Monday to address the escalating situation in Lebanon, according to Brussels, as Israel continues its air strikes following the death of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. A spokesperson announced that Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief, had convened a video meeting at 1500 GMT to discuss the European Union’s response to the worsening crisis in Lebanon. International efforts are underway to prevent the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah from turning into a wider regional war. So far, the 27-member European Union has struggled to present a unified response or wield significant influence to de-escalate the violence that has shaken the region over the past year. On Monday, Israel launched its first air strike in Beirut’s city center since the Gaza conflict erupted last year, killing four people. This raid marked a significant intensification in the ongoing air campaign, which saw the assassination of Hezbollah's long-standing leader, Nasrallah, last Friday, further escalating tensions. Since last Monday, Israeli air strikes have killed hundreds in Lebanon, the deadliest period since the country’s civil war from 1975 to 1990. The Lebanese health ministry reported that more than 700 people have been killed, including 14 paramedics over two days of bombing. The U.N. refugee agency's head, Filippo Grandi, revealed that over 200,000 people have been displaced within Lebanon, while more than 100,000 have fled to neighboring Syria. After nearly a year of a devastating military campaign in Gaza, prompted by Hamas’s attack on October 7 last year, Israel has increasingly shifted its focus toward Hezbollah.The post EU Calls Emergency Talks on Lebanon Escalation first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/eu-calls-emergency-talks-lebanon-escalation/	2024-09-30T06:08:39-07:00

Hezbollah’s deputy leader, Sheikh Naim Qassem, delivered a televised address on Monday in tribute to the slain Hezbollah leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and vowed that the group would continue its fight. 'Sayyed Nasrallah will always remain with us,' Qassem assured Hezbollah’s members and fighters. Contrary to Israeli claims that a meeting of 20 officials was targeted when Nasrallah was killed, Qassem stated that Israel is committing massacres across Lebanon. He also criticized the U.S. for aiding Israel, stating, 'Israel is mistaken if it believes war will help it achieve its objectives.' Despite the unprecedented attacks, Qassem emphasized that Hezbollah has endured and will continue to follow Nasrallah’s path, maintaining its goals and support for Palestine. 'We won’t abandon our positions, and the resistance will keep aiding Palestine,' he said, adding that the battle could be prolonged, but Hezbollah’s fighters are prepared for any ground invasion, and they expect victory. Qassem stressed that Israel will not be able to weaken Hezbollah’s military capabilities and that the group will soon choose a new secretary-general. He also praised Lebanon’s 'national unity,' expressing gratitude to the government, political groups, NGOs, and hospitals.The post Hezbollah’s Qassem Vows to Fight, Promises Swift Replacement for Nasrallah first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/qassem-fight-promises-replacement-nasrallah/	2024-09-30T06:07:13-07:00

Study Suggests Earth Captured the Moon from Space, Rather Than Fo...	For nearly four decades, the widely accepted theory has been that the Moon formed from debris resulting from a massive collision between Earth and another celestial body. However, a new study presents an alternative possibility: What if the Moon wasn't formed this way, but instead was a separate object from space that Earth's gravity managed to capture? During the Apollo missions between 1969 and 1972, astronauts collected over 800 pounds of lunar rocks and soil for analysis. These samples were found to be compositionally similar to materials on Earth, leading scientists to conclude that the Moon originated from Earth, forming around 60 million years after the solar system came into existence. At the 1984 Kona Conference, scientists largely agreed that the Moon had resulted from a collision with a young Earth. But two Penn State researchers, Darren Williams and Michael Zugger, challenge this long-standing theory. Their study, published in *The Planetary Science Journal*, suggests that the Moon may not have formed from this collision after all. Instead, they propose the Moon might have been part of a binary system with Earth—two space bodies orbiting each other—until Earth’s gravity pulled the Moon in and ejected the other object. 'The Kona Conference shaped the prevailing narrative for 40 years,' said Williams, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at Penn State Behrend. But he and Zugger, a senior research engineer at Penn State’s Applied Research Lab, argue that this explanation leaves unresolved issues. Why the Moon likely came from elsewhere One key issue is the Moon's current position. If the Moon had formed from a collision, the debris would have clumped together and formed a ring orbiting above Earth's equator. Yet, the Moon orbits in a plane more aligned with the Sun than with Earth’s equator. 'The Moon’s orbit is more in sync with the Sun than Earth’s equator,' Williams explained. In their binary-exchange capture theory, Williams and Zugger argue that Earth’s gravity captured one of the two objects in the binary system, making it the Moon. The other object was repelled. They also highlight another similar case within our solar system: Triton, Neptune’s largest moon. Current research suggests Triton was captured into Neptune's orbit from the Kuiper Belt, a region filled with binary objects. Initially, according to Williams and Zugger, the Moon’s orbit around Earth was highly elliptical. Over time, extreme tidal forces altered its shape, eventually becoming the near-circular orbit we see today. The researchers calculated the tidal effects and the Moon’s orbit, determining that over thousands of years, the Moon's orbit contracted and became more circular.The post Study Suggests Earth Captured the Moon from Space, Rather Than Forming It first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/earth-captured-moon-space-rather-forming/	2024-09-28T23:56:14-07:00	
Biden Calls Nasrallah’s Death a 'Measure of Justice,' Reaffirms U...	On Saturday, September 28, U.S. President Joe Biden described the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah as 'a measure of justice,' highlighting the militant group's responsibility for the deaths of hundreds of Americans during Nasrallah's nearly 40-year leadership. Hezbollah officially confirmed that their leader was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut the day before. In a statement released by the White House, Biden remarked, 'Hassan Nasrallah and Hezbollah, the terrorist group he commanded, are responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans throughout his four decades of terror. His death in an Israeli airstrike serves as justice for his many victims, including thousands of Americans, Israelis, and Lebanese civilians.' Biden further explained that the strike occurred within the broader context of the conflict that erupted after Hamas's deadly assault on October 7, 2023. He noted that Nasrallah had made the critical decision to join forces with Hamas and open a 'northern front' against Israel. Reaffirming Washington's support for Israel, Biden stated, 'The United States fully supports Israel’s right to defend itself against Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and other Iranian-backed terrorist organizations.' On Friday, Biden had also directed U.S. Secretary of Defense to strengthen the military’s defensive posture in the Middle East to deter aggression and mitigate the risk of a wider regional war. While pursuing diplomatic efforts to de-escalate conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon, Biden emphasized the importance of reaching a deal that would lead to a ceasefire, the release of hostages, and greater regional stability. He stated, 'It’s time for these agreements to be finalized, the threats to Israel to be removed, and for the Middle East to move towards greater peace and security.'The post Biden Calls Nasrallah’s Death a 'Measure of Justice,' Reaffirms US Support for Israel first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/biden-calls-nasrallahs-death-measure-justic/	2024-09-28T23:55:43-07:00	
Iran Vows Nasrallah’s 'Path Will Continue' Despite His Killing	Iran's foreign ministry stated on Saturday that Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah's mission will carry on despite his death in an Israeli airstrike, following nearly a year of cross-border hostilities between the two sides. Nasser Kanani, the foreign ministry spokesman, expressed in a social media post that 'the noble path of the resistance leader, Hassan Nasrallah, will persist, and his holy objective of liberating Quds (Jerusalem) will, with God's will, be achieved.'The post Iran Vows Nasrallah’s 'Path Will Continue' Despite His Killing first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/iran-nasrallahs-path-continue-despite-killing/	2024-09-28T23:35:01-07:00	
Iranian Revolutionary Guard General Killed in Israeli Strike Alon...	Iranian media reported on Saturday that a senior general in Iran's Revolutionary Guard, Gen. Abbas Nilforushan, was killed in the same Israeli airstrike that also claimed the life of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut's southern suburbs. This marks a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict as Nilforushan's death adds to the pressure on Iran to respond. His death comes as the conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza risks spreading into a broader regional war. According to Iranian sources, Nilforushan, who was 58 years old, was killed during the strike on Friday. The Tehran Times confirmed the news, and Ahmad Reza Pour Khaghan, Iran’s judiciary deputy head, also acknowledged his death, describing him as a 'guest' of the Lebanese people. Khaghan further mentioned that Iran reserves the right to retaliate under international law. Nilforushan had held a prominent role as the deputy commander for operations in the Revolutionary Guard and had been sanctioned by the U.S. in 2022 for his involvement in suppressing protests in Iran. He also played a significant role in supporting Syria's President Bashar Assad during Syria's civil war and had a long military career dating back to the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. Nilforushan was also noted to have been a close associate of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the commander of Iran’s Quds Force, who was killed by a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad in 2020.The post Iranian Revolutionary Guard General Killed in Israeli Strike Alongside Nasrallah first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/revolutionary-guard-general-killed-alongside-nasrallah/	2024-09-28T23:34:52-07:00

Air raid sirens blared across central Israel, including at Tel Aviv's international airport, shortly after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu returned from a trip to the United States. The Israeli military reported intercepting a missile launched from Yemen, with no injuries reported following the incident. It remains unclear if the missile was specifically targeting Netanyahu's flight. The Prime Minister had cut his U.S. trip short to address the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. Earlier on Saturday, Hezbollah confirmed that their leader and founding member, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in the suburbs of Beirut the day before.The post Houthis Launch Missile at Tel Aviv Shortly After Netanyahu’s Arrival first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/houthis-missile-tel-aviv-netanyahus-arrival/	2024-09-28T23:34:33-07:00	
Middle East Erupts in Response to Nasrallah’s Assassination	Middle Eastern nations and Hezbollah's allies within the Tehran-backed 'Axis of Resistance' responded on Saturday following the confirmed death of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, killed in Israeli airstrikes. Israeli military officials announced that Nasrallah, who had led Hezbollah for over 30 years, was killed in an attack on the group’s headquarters in southern Beirut on Friday night. Hours later, Hezbollah officially confirmed the death. Hezbollah The group released a statement confirming Nasrallah's death, stating he had 'joined his immortal martyr comrades whom he had led for about 30 years.' They reported that Nasrallah was killed along with several other members of the organization during the Israeli strike on Beirut's southern suburbs. Israel Israel's military described Nasrallah as one of its 'greatest enemies.' Military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari remarked, 'His elimination makes the world a safer place,' while noting that other senior Hezbollah leaders would still be targeted. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz declared Nasrallah’s death as one of the most justified acts of counterterrorism, calling it well-deserved. Iran Iran, Hezbollah’s primary supporter and financier, pledged that the direction Nasrallah had set for the group would continue. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanani said that Nasrallah’s mission of liberating Jerusalem would be pursued. Iran's First Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref warned Israel’s leaders that the bloodshed, including the death of Nasrallah, would lead to their downfall. Hamas The Palestinian militant group Hamas condemned Nasrallah's killing, labeling the Israeli airstrikes on southern Beirut as 'barbaric Zionist aggression.' Hamas characterized the assassination as a cowardly act and expressed condolences to Hezbollah. Yemen's Houthis The Houthi rebels in Yemen vowed that Nasrallah’s death would only strengthen their determination to fight Israel. They declared that his martyrdom would fuel their resolve to achieve victory and defeat the Israeli enemy. Iraq Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani condemned Nasrallah's killing, calling it a crime and accusing Israel of crossing all red lines. He described the Israeli airstrikes on Beirut as a shameful act and referred to Nasrallah as a martyr on the righteous path.The post Middle East Erupts in Response to Nasrallah’s Assassination first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/middle-east-response-to-nasrallahs-assassination/	2024-09-28T23:34:24-07:00	
Hashem Safieddine Tipped as Potential Successor to Hezbollah Lead...	Sayyed Hashem Safieddine is one of the key figures within Hezbollah and is regarded as a potential successor to his cousin, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the current leader of the group. Safieddine, who shares a striking resemblance to Nasrallah, is in his late 50s or early 60s and has strong family and religious ties to Iran, Hezbollah's primary backer. Safieddine has long been a significant figure within the organization, serving on its influential Shura Council, which makes key decisions for the group. In 2017, both the United States and Saudi Arabia designated Safieddine as a 'terrorist,' with the U.S. Treasury describing him as a senior Hezbollah leader and a key figure within its executive body. Though Nasrallah's deputy, Sheikh Naim Qassem, would assume leadership upon Nasrallah's death, the Shura Council would convene to elect a new secretary-general. Safieddine, with his religious studies background from Qom, Iran, and close familial ties to influential figures such as General Qasem Soleimani—his son is married to Soleimani's daughter—makes him a strong candidate to succeed Nasrallah. Unlike Nasrallah, who has spent much of his time in hiding, Safieddine has been more visible in public, attending political and religious events openly. His calm demeanor shifts to more fiery rhetoric during moments of heightened tension, such as funerals of Hezbollah fighters killed in recent clashes with Israel. Hezbollah, founded during the Lebanese civil war with the help of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, is a major player in Lebanese politics and military activities, particularly known for its resistance to Israeli occupation in southern Lebanon, which lasted until 2000. Safieddine, with his long-standing role within Hezbollah’s leadership, is widely considered the strongest candidate to take up the leadership mantle should Nasrallah no longer lead.The post Hashem Safieddine Tipped as Potential Successor to Hezbollah Leader Nasrallah first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/safieddine-successor-hezbollah-leader-nasrallah/	2024-09-28T23:34:13-07:00	
DOJ Charges Three Iranian Operatives for Hacking Trump Campaign	The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced criminal charges on Friday, September 27, against three individuals linked to Iran for targeting Donald Trump's presidential campaign. The accused, identified as Masoud Jalili, Yaser Balaghi, and Seyyed Ali Aghamiri, are suspected to have ties to Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. The charges include conspiracy to access a protected computer, fraud, aggravated identity theft, and conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization, along with eight counts of wire fraud. According to the unsealed indictment, the trio sought to influence the U.S. presidential election by accessing confidential information from Trump's campaign. On August 10, Trump's campaign claimed it had been hacked, blaming Iranian actors. News outlets such as Politico, the New York Times, and the Washington Post were reportedly given leaked information but declined to publish it. Last week, U.S. intelligence officials disclosed that the same operatives also attempted to reach Joe Biden's campaign in June and July. They sent unsolicited emails containing excerpts of stolen material from Trump’s campaign, though there was no evidence that Biden's team responded to the messages. The campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris considered the emails to be spam or phishing attempts. Iran has denied any involvement in the U.S. elections. A statement from Iran's mission to the United Nations, quoted by CBS News, stated that 'the Islamic Republic of Iran does not engage in the internal conflicts or electoral controversies of the United States,' and firmly denied any intent or motive to interfere in the U.S. election.The post DOJ Charges Three Iranian Operatives for Hacking Trump Campaign first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/doj-charges-three-iranian-hacking-trump/	2024-09-28T05:27:21-07:00	
Breaking: Dahieh Strike Leaves 2 Dead, 76 Injured; Source Says Na...	The Health Ministry reported that two people were killed and 76 others injured in a major Israeli airstrike on Beirut’s densely populated southern suburbs on Friday. The ministry's statement indicated that 15 of the injured required hospitalization, but emphasized that the figures were preliminary. The strikes hit the Haret Hreik neighborhood, a known Hezbollah stronghold, and Israeli media suggested that the group's leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, was the intended target. However, a source close to Hezbollah, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that Nasrallah was unharmed, saying, 'Sayyed Nasrallah is fine.' Israeli media outlets, including three major television channels, reported that Nasrallah was indeed the target of the attack. The timing and magnitude of the blasts hinted that a high-ranking Hezbollah leader may have been present in the targeted buildings. In a potentially significant move, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short his trip to the United States and returned to Israel earlier than planned, foregoing his stay until the end of the Sabbath on Saturday. Netanyahu had addressed the U.N. earlier, pledging that Israel’s military campaign against Hezbollah would continue, dashing hopes for an internationally mediated cease-fire. Netanyahu was reportedly briefed on the strikes as they occurred while speaking with journalists. A military aide interrupted the briefing, prompting him to quickly conclude the discussion. Unlike previous conflicts, Israel has aggressively targeted Hezbollah's top leadership in recent days. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant's office revealed that he was in meetings with the Israeli air force chief and other senior commanders for updates on the situation. According to Israeli military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the strikes specifically targeted Hezbollah's main headquarters, which were located beneath residential buildings. Lebanon's national news agency reported that six buildings in the Haret Hreik area were reduced to rubble. The force of the explosion could be felt as far as 30 kilometers (18 miles) away, shaking homes and shattering windows. Ambulances rushed to the scene, responding to the devastation with sirens blaring.The post Breaking: Dahieh Strike Leaves 2 Dead, 76 Injured; Source Says Nasrallah is 'Fine' first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/dahieh-strike-2-dead-76-injured-nasrallah-fine/	2024-09-28T04:53:47-07:00	
Israeli Airstrikes Pound Beirut’s Southern Suburbs After Evacuati...	Israel launched multiple airstrikes on Hezbollah’s main stronghold in southern Beirut, sending massive plumes of smoke into the sky above the densely populated area. The strikes on Friday, which were heard across the Mediterranean city, caused panic in the residential neighborhood, which has been a Hezbollah stronghold for decades. These were the most intense strikes on Beirut’s suburbs since Israel shifted its military focus from Gaza to Lebanon earlier this week, targeting Hezbollah positions across the country and resulting in the deaths of hundreds. Reports from Israeli media suggested that Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah was the intended target of the first strike. However, a source close to the group stated that Nasrallah was unharmed. Nasrallah, a revered figure among his followers, has remained hidden from public view for years to avoid assassination. He is regarded as the only person in Lebanon with the authority to either wage war or broker peace. On Saturday, Israel's military announced that their strikes had killed Muhammad Ali Ismail, the commander of Hezbollah's missile unit in southern Lebanon, along with his deputy and other senior officials. The strikes felt like an earthquake, according to Ahmad Ahmad, a resident who fled the southern suburbs. Another resident, Abir Hammoud, described the fear, saying she thought the building was about to collapse. Following the initial wave of strikes, which reportedly leveled six buildings, a second round of bombing hit Hezbollah weapon storage sites, though the group denied this. Hezbollah retaliated by firing more rockets into Israel, with no immediate reports of casualties. In response to the strikes, the Israeli military warned civilians in parts of southern Beirut to evacuate before the second wave of bombings and emphasized that it would not allow Iran to transfer weapons to Hezbollah through Beirut’s airport. They also confirmed strikes on Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon, near Tyre. The violence has raised concerns of a broader conflict, with U.N. officials describing it as the deadliest period in Lebanon in a generation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to continue the fight against Hezbollah until Israel’s northern border was secure. Meanwhile, calls for a ceasefire from international leaders, including U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, have yet to yield results. Diplomatic efforts to end the war in Gaza are seen as key to curbing the fighting in Lebanon and preventing further escalation. Despite the ongoing conflict, a Gaza ceasefire remains out of reach, even after months of mediation. Hamas’ October 7 attack led to the deaths of over 1,200 people, with hostages still being held in Gaza. Israel’s military retaliation has caused more than 41,000 deaths in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to U.N.-verified reports. Amid the escalating tensions, Iran condemned the strikes on Beirut, calling them a dangerous escalation. Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian denounced the actions as a 'flagrant war crime.' Israel, in turn, warned Iran that its military reach extends across the entire Middle East, further fueling fears of regional instability.The post Israeli Airstrikes Pound Beirut’s Southern Suburbs After Evacuation Warnings first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-airstrikes-beiruts-southern-suburbs-warnings/	2024-09-28T04:53:34-07:00

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seemingly addressed the recent Israeli strike in southern Beirut, which reportedly targeted Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. Speaking at a Shabbat event before leaving New York, Netanyahu referenced a common phrase used by Nasrallah, who has often described Israel as weak, likening it to a 'spider web' destined to vanish. 'Our enemies believed we were as fragile as a spider’s web,' Netanyahu remarked, alluding to Nasrallah's repeated metaphor. 'What spider web are they talking about? We have tendons of steel — in both will and strength.' He emphasized that Israel is engaged in a fight for its survival, adding, 'This is no exaggeration. The people of Israel live, and when necessary, they strike back. Today, we struck back decisively, and we will continue doing so. Our goal is to ensure Israel’s eternity, and we are committed to Israel’s victory.' Netanyahu concluded by expressing his hope for a 'relatively quiet Shabbat.'The post Netanyahu After Nasrallah Strike: 'Our Enemies Thought We Were a Spider Web' first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/netanyahunasrallah-strike-enemies-spider-web/	2024-09-28T04:53:20-07:00	
Top EU Diplomat Regrets Failure to 'Stop' Netanyahu	EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell expressed his regret that no global power, including the United States, has been able to halt Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's military actions in both Lebanon and Gaza. According to Borrell, Netanyahu seems determined to continue the fighting, despite diplomatic efforts for a ceasefire. Borrell, speaking to journalists at the U.N. General Assembly, stated that while diplomatic pressure for a ceasefire is being applied, 'nobody seems to be able to stop Netanyahu' in either Gaza or the West Bank. Israel has had a contentious relationship with Borrell, with Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz recently accusing him of being 'antisemitic.' Borrell voiced support for a 21-day ceasefire in Lebanon, proposed by France and the United States, though Israel has rejected this, continuing its intensified strikes on Hezbollah, which have resulted in hundreds of deaths. Borrell noted Netanyahu's stance that Israel will not stop until Hezbollah is destroyed, drawing parallels to Israel's long-standing campaign against Hamas in Gaza. Borrell warned that if Netanyahu’s approach to Hezbollah mirrors that of Hamas, the conflict could extend into a prolonged war. He also reiterated the need to diversify diplomatic efforts beyond the United States, as U.S.-led attempts at securing a truce in Gaza have not succeeded. He expressed doubts that the U.S. is currently willing to restart negotiations similar to the Camp David talks of 2000, which aimed but failed to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.The post Top EU Diplomat Regrets Failure to 'Stop' Netanyahu first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/eu-diplomat-regrets-failure-stop-netanyahu/	2024-09-28T04:52:49-07:00	
Hezbollah Fires Projectiles at Northern and Central Israel	Hezbollah fired over two dozen projectiles towards Israel on Saturday morning, setting off alarms in more than 100 locations across Israel and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The Israeli military reported that a surface-to-surface missile was launched from Lebanon, landing in an open area in central Israel. Israeli media indicated that the missile fell into the sea. Fortunately, no injuries or property damage were reported, as confirmed by Israel's Fire and Rescue Services. While exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah have been ongoing since October 8, primarily concentrated around the border region, recent attacks have extended deeper into both countries. This past week, Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon have resulted in over 720 deaths, including many women and children, according to statistics from the Lebanese Health Ministry. Several individuals have also been injured in Israel during the escalating violence.The post Hezbollah Fires Projectiles at Northern and Central Israel first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-projectiles-northern-central-israel/	2024-09-28T04:52:33-07:00	
Breaking: Israeli Airstrikes Hammer Beirut Suburbs as Nasrallah’s...	Israeli fighter jets launched a series of heavy airstrikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut overnight into Saturday, reportedly targeting Hezbollah’s headquarters. Some reports claimed that one of the strikes aimed at Hezbollah's leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, although sources close to the group said he was unharmed. Israel stated it was attacking Hezbollah's command centers and weapons facilities. The strikes were some of the most intense on the group’s stronghold since the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. On Friday night, the sound of relentless shelling echoed across Beirut, and Israel issued warnings for residents in certain parts of the city to evacuate. Hundreds of families fled their homes, many seeking refuge in central Beirut or along the coast. Radwan Msallam, a Syrian refugee and father of six, described the chaos: 'We had nowhere to go. We took what we could and left.' While Israeli officials did not confirm if Nasrallah was killed, they claimed responsibility for eliminating Muhammad Ali Ismail, a commander of Hezbollah’s missile unit, along with other senior figures in the organization. Speaking at the U.N. General Assembly, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reaffirmed Israel’s commitment to fight Hezbollah until the threat to Israel’s border was fully neutralized. Hezbollah has been carrying out low-level attacks on Israel since the Hamas attack on October 7, escalating the conflict. In response, Israel has increasingly shifted its military focus from Gaza to Lebanon, where ongoing airstrikes have killed over 700 people and displaced around 118,000. The initial Israeli strike on Beirut hit Hezbollah's central headquarters, located beneath residential buildings in the Dahiyeh district, according to Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari. A source close to Hezbollah stated that six buildings were destroyed in the first wave of strikes. Lebanon’s health ministry reported that six people were killed, and 91 were injured. A second wave of attacks followed early on Saturday, targeting additional locations in the southern suburbs. Israel also carried out airstrikes in the Bekaa Valley and the city of Tyre. There has been no official confirmation of Nasrallah’s status since the airstrikes. Amid the escalating violence, Hezbollah claimed responsibility for a rocket attack on northern Israel in retaliation, stating that it was defending Lebanon and its people. Fears of a full-scale regional conflict have grown, with Israel raising the possibility of a ground invasion against Hezbollah. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged world leaders to avoid further escalation and to seek a ceasefire. In his U.N. address, Netanyahu also addressed the war in Gaza, pledging that Israel would fight Hamas until 'total victory' was achieved. Diplomats have emphasized that efforts to end the fighting in Gaza are crucial to preventing further conflict in Lebanon. Hamas' attack on Israel on October 7 resulted in the deaths of over 1,200 people, most of them civilians, according to Israeli figures. Amid growing tensions, Netanyahu issued a warning to Iran, saying that if Tehran strikes Israel, 'we will strike you.' He added that Israel’s reach extends throughout the Middle East, including Iran. Iran has condemned Israel’s actions, with its embassy in Lebanon describing the strikes as a dangerous escalation, while President Masoud Pezeshkian denounced them as 'flagrant war crimes.'The post Breaking: Israeli Airstrikes Hammer Beirut Suburbs as Nasrallah’s Fate Remains Unknown first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-airstrikes-beirut-nasrallahs-fate-unknown/	2024-09-28T04:52:21-07:00	
Israeli Army Claims Nasrallah Killed in Dahieh Strike	Israel's military reported on Saturday that Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Beirut the previous night. However, there has been no official confirmation from Hezbollah regarding his death. Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli military spokesperson, confirmed the news on the social media platform X, stating, 'Hassan Nasrallah is dead.' Another Israeli military representative, Captain David Avraham, confirmed to AFP that Nasrallah had been 'eliminated' following the airstrikes on the Lebanese capital. A source close to Hezbollah, speaking anonymously to AFP, mentioned that communication with Nasrallah had been lost since Friday evening. The source recalled that similar rumors about his death had circulated during the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, but Nasrallah had later resurfaced unharmed. Israel's military issued a statement explaining that the strikes also killed Ali Karake, identified as the commander of Hezbollah's southern front, along with other unspecified Hezbollah leaders. The statement further claimed that the attack occurred while Hezbollah's senior leadership was orchestrating terrorist operations against Israeli civilians. The statement emphasized that during his 32 years as Hezbollah's leader, Nasrallah was responsible for numerous attacks on Israeli civilians and soldiers, as well as directing terrorist activities globally. Hezbollah has been firing rockets into Israel since the October 7 attack by Hamas on southern Israel, which triggered the current conflict. Recently, Israel has escalated its operations in Lebanon, resulting in heavy bombardment that has caused over 700 deaths and displaced about 118,000 people.The post Israeli Army Claims Nasrallah Killed in Dahieh Strike first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-claims-nasrallah-killed-dahieh-strike/	2024-09-28T04:52:09-07:00

Breaking: Israel Hid Explosives in Pagers Sold to Hezbollah, Clai...	Israel carried out sophisticated attacks against Hezbollah by secretly rigging pagers with explosives, Lebanese security officials revealed. These attacks, which targeted communications devices like pagers and walkie-talkies, resulted in at least 37 deaths and nearly 3,000 injuries, affecting many civilians. On September 17, Lebanese officials conducted controlled detonations of these weaponized pagers, which were off during the initial attack and hence did not explode. This demonstration showcased the potential devastation of the blasts on those carrying the devices. Despite Israel not openly admitting to these attacks, sources indicate that the operation was a collaboration between Mossad and the Israeli military, as hinted by Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in his praise for the security forces’ joint achievements. The explosive materials were ingeniously hidden inside the pager batteries, making them undetectable. Lebanese security sources highlighted the sophistication of the technology used, noting the explosives were discreetly integrated within the pagers' lithium batteries. Experts explained that these improvised explosive devices (IEDs) required minimal additional components due to the existing parts in the pagers, such as the power source and the casing. Modifications likely involved embedding a small explosive charge and an electronic detonator directly into the battery. Further investigations traced the pagers back to a model produced by the Taiwanese company Gold Apollo, under dubious circumstances involving shell companies and possibly involving Hungarian and Bulgarian entities, to obscure the operation's origins. Taiwanese and Hungarian authorities are investigating the supply chain links, with no conclusive evidence yet found to pinpoint the exact source or pathway of these modified pagers. Meanwhile, Hezbollah's leadership has initiated their own investigations to determine the exact sequence of events leading to the attack, vowing consequences for those responsible.The post Breaking: Israel Hid Explosives in Pagers Sold to Hezbollah, Claim Lebanese Officials first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-explosives-pagers-sold-hezbollah/	2024-09-27T00:42:00-07:00	
Mikati: Ceasefire Deal Hinges on Netanyahu	Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati stated that he has taken 'all necessary actions to safeguard Lebanon' amid increasing tensions with Israel, highlighting that both foreign and Arab nations have backed Lebanon's position. Mikati expressed concerns about the practical application of peace efforts, particularly questioning Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's willingness to adhere to a statement made by the U.S. and France. He noted that Netanyahu had previously dismissed several peace overtures proposed by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the United Nations Security Council, and various Arab entities, according to the Mustaqbal Web news portal. Mikati emphasized, 'We have fulfilled our responsibilities; however, the outcome is beyond our control.'The post Mikati: Ceasefire Deal Hinges on Netanyahu first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/mikati-ceasefire-deal-hinges-netanyahu/	2024-09-27T00:41:41-07:00	
US and France to Press Netanyahu After Dermer Rejects Lebanon Tru...	Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, a close associate of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, conveyed to U.S. mediator Amos Hochstein in New York that Israel will persist in its military actions in Lebanon and rejects the current ceasefire proposals, according to an Arab diplomat. Despite Israel's stance, there is ongoing diplomacy involving the U.S., Qatar, France, and Turkey. These nations are engaged in discussions, and mediators remain hopeful about finding a resolution, the diplomat revealed to LBCI television. The diplomatic efforts include planned talks between the French and Americans with Netanyahu, while Qatari and Turkish officials are set to meet with Iranian representatives, the diplomat further stated.The post US and France to Press Netanyahu After Dermer Rejects Lebanon Truce Proposals first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-france-press-netanyahu-dermer-rejects-lebanon-truce/	2024-09-27T00:41:21-07:00	
Netanyahu Vows to Strike Hezbollah Until All Goals Are Met	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Thursday that Israel will persist in its aggressive operations against Hezbollah, emphasizing that the strikes will continue unabated until all objectives are met, including the secure return of northern residents to their homes. This declaration came as he arrived in New York for the U.N. General Assembly amidst efforts by the U.S. and Europe to instigate a 21-day ceasefire for peace talks. Prior to this, the Israeli military reported an operation targeting a Hezbollah drone commander in Beirut's southern suburbs. Netanyahu’s firm stance diminishes the prospects of an impending ceasefire, with Israel intensifying its military actions in Lebanon over the past week, citing direct responses to over 11 months of cross-border attacks by Hezbollah. The international community's call for a ceasefire aims to curb the severe hostilities that have already resulted in significant casualties in Lebanon and heightened the risk of a full-scale war. Israel is also considering a ground invasion to displace Hezbollah forces from proximate border areas. While Hezbollah has yet to formally respond to the ceasefire suggestion, Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati has endorsed it, highlighting the regional desire for peace. However, Hezbollah remains steadfast, conditioning any cessation of hostilities on a ceasefire in Gaza, where Israel has been engaged with Hamas for nearly a year. Amidst these tensions, Netanyahu affirmed the continuation of the Gaza operations until all military goals are achieved. His statements coincide with potential political instability within his government, as far-right coalition partners threaten withdrawal support should a ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah materialize, potentially jeopardizing his majority in parliament.The post Netanyahu Vows to Strike Hezbollah Until All Goals Are Met first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/netanyahu-strike-hezbollah-all-goals-met/	2024-09-27T00:40:57-07:00	
Britain Sends Humanitarian Aid to Civilians in Lebanon	Britain has announced it will provide $6.7 million in humanitarian aid to Lebanon, aimed at helping civilians affected by ongoing conflicts that have forced thousands to flee their homes. The aid package includes medical supplies, hygiene kits, and fuel, with the distribution of these resources to be managed by UNICEF. This support is intended to assist aid workers in addressing critical health and nutrition needs within the civilian population. In anticipation of potential escalations in the region's conflict, the UK has also prepared for the possible evacuation of British nationals. To this end, 700 military personnel, including members from the Border Force and the Foreign Office, have been stationed at a British military base in Cyprus. Additionally, an online portal and a dedicated phone line have been reactivated to help British citizens in Lebanon register their presence and receive assistance. Cyprus, located about 210 kilometers west of Beirut, previously served as a transit point for around 60,000 foreign nationals evacuated from Lebanon during the 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. Anneliese Dodds, Britain's Minister of State for Development, Women and Equalities, affirmed the UK's ongoing commitment to support the Lebanese people and encouraged British nationals to depart from Lebanon. Moreover, the British navy has positioned the RFA Mounts Bay and HMS Duncan in the eastern Mediterranean, and the Royal Air Force has aircraft and transport helicopters ready to provide additional support as necessary.The post Britain Sends Humanitarian Aid to Civilians in Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/britain-humanitarian-aid-civilians-lebanon/	2024-09-26T05:11:36-07:00	
US and Allies Push for 21-Day Ceasefire in Lebanon	On Wednesday, the United States, France, and other allies called for an urgent 21-day ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. This appeal, crafted during discussions at the U.N. General Assembly in New York, aims to halt the recent violence that has claimed over 600 lives in Lebanon. The joint statement described the ongoing conflict as intolerable and warned of the risk it poses for broader regional escalation. The call for a ceasefire seeks to create a window for diplomatic negotiations, urging all involved parties, including the governments of Israel and Lebanon, to agree to the ceasefire without delay. Despite the appeal, there was no immediate response from the Israeli or Lebanese governments or from Hezbollah. Senior U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, mentioned that while Hezbollah itself wouldn't sign the ceasefire, they anticipate that the Lebanese government would agree to it in coordination with Hezbollah. These officials also expect a positive reception from Israel, particularly when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addresses the General Assembly. This ceasefire initiative is part of broader efforts to stabilize the region, which has seen months of escalating exchanges of fire, displacing tens of thousands and stoking fears of a larger conflict. The proposal also aims to rejuvenate stalled talks for a ceasefire and hostage release between Israel and Hamas, indicating a complex intertwining of regional conflicts. The ceasefire proposal was a result of rapid diplomatic efforts led by President Joe Biden's security team, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. These efforts included securing endorsements from various global leaders and aligning international support for a pause in fighting, which could potentially lead to more permanent solutions. Notably, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot and Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati have publicly supported the ceasefire, urging quick acceptance to prevent further escalation. Conversely, Israel's U.N. Ambassador, Danny Danon, expressed a preference for a ceasefire to facilitate the return of residents near the border, emphasizing that Israel does not desire a full-scale war. The Security Council resolution that ended the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah was also reaffirmed by both Danon and Mikati. This resolution, which has not been fully implemented, includes provisions for a cessation of hostilities and the disarmament of armed groups in Lebanon, including Hezbollah. President Biden, speaking on 'The View,' mentioned that while an all-out war remains a possibility, there is also a chance for a significant diplomatic resolution that could transform the regional dynamics, underscoring his administration's commitment to finding a peaceful solution. Additionally, the U.S. has intensified its pressure on entities supporting Hezbollah through sanctions targeting illicit Iranian petroleum shipments, demonstrating the multifaceted approach the U.S. is employing to address the complex issues in the Middle East.The post US and Allies Push for 21-Day Ceasefire in Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-allies-push-21-day-ceasefire-lebanon/	2024-09-26T05:11:26-07:00	
Hezbollah Strikes Israeli Defense Complexes Near Haifa Again	On Thursday, the Israeli military reported conducting airstrikes on approximately 75 Hezbollah-associated sites in Lebanon throughout the night. These targets included the group's ammunition storage facilities and rocket launchers, as well as various other militant resources located in the Bekaa region and southern Lebanon. Simultaneously, Israel detected 45 projectiles launched from Lebanon, with some being intercepted by Israeli defenses and the others landing in unpopulated areas. Israeli aircraft continued their operations in southern Lebanon in response. Hezbollah confirmed it had attacked the Rafael military industry complexes near Haifa in northern Israel, targeting the site with multiple rockets. This attack was part of Hezbollah's ongoing campaign, which it says defends Lebanon and its people. On the previous day, Israeli airstrikes resulted in 72 fatalities across Lebanon. Breakdowns from the Lebanese ministry indicated that 38 deaths occurred in southern Lebanon, 12 in the eastern Bekaa area, and 22 across three towns both north and south of Beirut. These strikes also left nearly 400 people wounded. Over the last three days, the Israeli military has targeted over 2,000 Hezbollah sites in Lebanon, including several hundred sites hit on Wednesday alone.The post Hezbollah Strikes Israeli Defense Complexes Near Haifa Again first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-strikes-israeli-defense-complexes-haifa/	2024-09-26T05:11:10-07:00

Israeli Strike Kills 23 Syrian Workers Near Baalbek	On Thursday, Lebanon's state-run news agency reported that an Israeli airstrike targeted a building in northeastern Lebanon, near Baalbek in the eastern Bekaa Valley, killing 23 Syrian workers and injuring eight others. The airstrike occurred late Wednesday and impacted a region close to the Syrian border. The mayor of Younine, Ali Kassas, confirmed that the victims included 23 Syrians found in the debris, alongside four injured Syrians and four Lebanese nationals. Local official Hussein Salloum noted that the casualties primarily included women and children, and described the community's efforts to rescue survivors, which continued into Thursday morning with limited resources until additional help, such as a bulldozer, arrived. The Lebanese Red Cross and other groups, including Hezbollah's paramedic service and the Lebanese Civil Defense, were involved in recovery operations. This strike is part of a series of intense Israeli bombings targeting Hezbollah locations in Lebanon, which have also responded with rocket fire into Israel. The conflict has resulted in over 630 deaths on the Lebanese side, including a significant number of women and children, as reported by local health officials. Meanwhile, in Israel, several have been injured by shrapnel. Lebanon, home to about 6 million people, is also host to nearly 780,000 registered Syrian refugees, plus hundreds of thousands unregistered, making it the country with the highest refugee population per capita worldwide.The post Israeli Strike Kills 23 Syrian Workers Near Baalbek first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-kills-23-syrian-workers-baalbek/	2024-09-26T05:10:34-07:00

On Thursday, the Israeli military announced that its air force had conducted strikes on facilities located at the Syria-Lebanon border. These facilities were reportedly used by Hezbollah for transporting weapons from Syria into Lebanon.

The strikes come amidst ongoing cross-border hostilities and increasing international demands for a ceasefire.The post Israeli Army Strikes Hezbollah Infrastructure on Syria-Lebanon Border first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strikes-hezbollah-infrastructure-syria-lebanon-border/	2024-09-26T04:41:24-07:00	
Conflicting Reports Emerge on Israel-Lebanon Ceasefire Talks	According to sources close to negotiations taking place in New York, there is significant progress toward reaching a ceasefire agreement between Lebanon and Israel, as reported by Lebanon's MTV. Meanwhile, an Arab diplomat spoke to LBCI television, stating that the Israeli representative at the U.N. had expressed strong reservations about a U.S. ceasefire proposal and confirmed that military operations in Lebanon would continue. The same diplomat mentioned that envoys interacting with Hezbollah received ambiguous responses, with Hezbollah tying any resolution to an agreement with Hamas, who has yet to approve the proposal’s language. Additionally, officials from the U.S., France, Qatar, and Egypt plan to meet soon to consider adjustments to the proposed ceasefire. In a joint statement, these nations, along with other international and regional allies, called for an immediate 21-day ceasefire along the Lebanon-Israel border to facilitate diplomatic efforts. Israeli media reported that a ceasefire could take effect within hours. Despite reports that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had instructed the military to reduce its operations in Lebanon due to the ongoing negotiations, his office later denied these claims, stating that Netanyahu had not yet responded to the ceasefire proposal. Furthermore, Qatar clarified that the negotiations for a ceasefire in Gaza are not directly linked to the international efforts for a ceasefire in Lebanon. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, known for his firm stance, declared on social media that Israel would not agree to a ceasefire and would continue its military actions against Hezbollah 'until victory' and until residents can safely return to northern Israel.The post Conflicting Reports Emerge on Israel-Lebanon Ceasefire Talks first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/conflicting-reports-israel-lebanon-talks/	2024-09-26T04:41:04-07:00	
Israel Vows to Fight Hezbollah 'Until Victory'	On Thursday, Israel firmly dismissed a proposal, primarily supported by the United States, for a 21-day ceasefire with Lebanon. Israel affirmed its commitment to continue its military actions against Hezbollah militants until it achieves victory. Israeli forces have been conducting heavy aerial attacks on Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon, resulting in numerous casualties, while Hezbollah has retaliated with rocket fire. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz stated on the social media platform X that Israel would not cease its military efforts in the north, aiming for a decisive victory and the secure return of northern residents to their homes. Shortly before this, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu clarified that he hadn't responded to the ceasefire suggestion and instructed the military to persist with their operations at full strength. This stance came as the United States, France, and other international allies called for a three-week halt to hostilities. This appeal was made during meetings held on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, stating that the ongoing conflict was detrimental to both Lebanese and Israeli interests. On the ground, the conflict showed no signs of abating. The Israeli military targeted around 75 Hezbollah positions in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley and the south, areas that have witnessed significant civilian displacement recently. An airstrike near Baalbek resulted in at least nine fatalities, and the intensity of the attacks led local residents to describe the experience as one of the worst nights of their lives. Amidst these developments, the possibility of an Israeli ground offensive looms, with Israel's military chief instructing preparations for such an operation, and the call-up of two reserve brigades for northern duties. The ongoing violence brings back painful memories of the 2006 conflict between Hezbollah and Israel, which had a devastating toll on both sides. The U.N. reports that the current Israeli bombings have displaced 90,000 people within Lebanon. Amidst these tensions, Hezbollah claimed a significant attack on what it said was an Israeli intelligence center near Tel Aviv. Meanwhile, Iran's Foreign Minister warned of a regional catastrophe and pledged support for Lebanon against further Israeli escalations. The violence has already led to significant casualties, with hundreds killed in just a few days, marking some of the deadliest days in Lebanon's recent history, rivaling the bloodshed seen during the 1975-1990 civil war. While the link between the Gaza conflict and the situation in Lebanon remains complex, Qatar, a mediator in the discussions to end the fighting in Gaza, indicated that while the negotiations are interconnected, there isn't a direct link between the two conflict areas.The post Israel Vows to Fight Hezbollah 'Until Victory' first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-vows-fight-hezbollah-until-victory/	2024-09-26T04:40:46-07:00

Hezbollah Isn’t Hamas: Can Israel Handle Another Full-Scale War?	After nearly a year of conflict in Gaza, Israel has intensified its military operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon, launching covert strikes on communication devices and a severe bombing campaign that resulted in numerous casualties. This escalation comes amid ongoing tension with Hamas, which has already stretched Israel's military resources thin, evidenced by shortages and mounting economic and public pressure for peace and resolution of hostage situations. The possibility of an Israeli ground invasion into Lebanon remains uncertain, raising questions about Israel's capacity to manage another major conflict. The hostility between Israel and Hezbollah has escalated since October 8, the day after a deadly attack by Hamas on Israel, with Hezbollah launching attacks in solidarity with Gaza. Recent actions by Israel in Lebanon have significantly escalated tensions, including a notable operation where devices used by Hezbollah were remotely detonated, causing widespread injuries. This was followed by increased exchanges of fire, which if escalated further, could plunge Israel into a more challenging conflict with Hezbollah, a group considered more formidable than Hamas. Hezbollah, described as a 'state within a state' by Yoel Guzansky of the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), possesses advanced military capabilities and strategic ties throughout the Middle East, including Iran, Iraq, and Yemen. Despite improvements in Israeli military technology like the Iron Dome, Hezbollah's arsenal, including a large number of long-range ballistic missiles, poses a significant threat. Recent strikes by Hezbollah have reached deeper into Israeli territory than before, signaling an escalation in their capabilities. This ongoing conflict has led to significant displacement and casualties on both sides, highlighting the severe implications of this widening confrontation. Israel faces multiple challenges in a potential broader conflict with Hezbollah: 1. A more formidable opponent: Hezbollah's sophisticated weaponry and extensive network across the Middle East present a substantial challenge. 2. Stretched military resources: Israel's military is already taxed by the ongoing conflict with Hamas, and extending to another front could overstretch its capabilities. 3. Economic decline: The war's impact on Israel's economy has been severe, with significant contractions and increased military expenditures that strain financial resources. 4. Political and legitimacy issues: Internationally and domestically, there is a crisis of legitimacy and support concerning Israel's aggressive military strategies, especially if a new front opens against Hezbollah. These factors collectively complicate Israel's strategic decisions as it navigates the complexities of simultaneous conflicts on multiple fronts.The post Hezbollah Isn’t Hamas: Can Israel Handle Another Full-Scale War? first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-isnt-hamas-israel-handle-full-war/	2024-09-25T00:09:15-07:00	
Israeli Strikes Trigger Lebanon’s Deadliest Day in 20 Years: What...	On Monday, a series of airstrikes by Israel hit multiple areas across Lebanon, marking a day of significant violence not seen since the conflicts of 2006 between Israel and Hezbollah, the Iran-supported militant group. The air assaults resulted in the deaths of over 500 people and injuries to more than 1,800, sparking widespread panic among the Lebanese population. The casualties included a mix of civilians and Hezbollah militants, with bombs dropping on densely populated areas often described as Hezbollah strongholds. In response to these actions, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated that these operations were part of a strategy to alter the strategic dynamics on Israel's northern border. The Israeli military executed these strikes targeting approximately 1,600 Hezbollah-related sites, and the continuation of airstrikes into the next day suggests a sustained campaign. This escalation of violence has raised international alarms, with several nations expressing concerns about the potential for broader regional conflict and urging for de-escalation. Despite the severity of the attack, neither Israel nor Hezbollah has formally declared war, maintaining the ongoing tension as an escalation rather than outright warfare. The attacks predominantly focused on areas near Lebanon's border with Syria, a region where Hezbollah is notably active. The targets included advanced weaponry such as cruise missiles and rocket arsenals, which Israel claimed were stored within civilian areas, thereby increasing the risk to non-combatants. Many residents, receiving warnings through texts and calls, hastily evacuated their homes. In the midst of this turmoil, educational institutions closed, and transportation was disrupted, indicating a severe impact on daily life in Lebanon. The Lebanese government enacted emergency measures to manage the crisis, while the Israeli cabinet heightened security protocols across Israel in anticipation of further conflict. The situation has drawn international attention, with global powers and organizations stepping in to mediate and hopefully steer the parties away from an all-out war. This is particularly crucial as the region teeters on the brink of a broader conflict, given the historical animosity between Israel and Hezbollah and the current volatile state of affairs.The post Israeli Strikes Trigger Lebanon’s Deadliest Day in 20 Years: What We Know first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strikes-lebanons-deadliest-day-20-years/	2024-09-25T00:09:00-07:00	
Israeli Military Intercepts Rare Missile from Lebanon Near Tel Av...	On Wednesday, Israel's military reported intercepting a missile fired from Lebanon near the country's economic hub, Tel Aviv, marking a rare attack far from the usual conflict zones with Hezbollah. 'After sirens sounded in the Tel Aviv and Netanya areas, one surface-to-surface missile was detected crossing from Lebanon and was intercepted by the IDF Aerial Defense Array,' said the Israeli military. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. This escalation comes amidst ongoing tensions since last October's outbreak of conflict between Israel and Hamas. Hezbollah, backed by Iran, has been launching rockets and drones from Lebanon, primarily targeting northern Israel. The missile interception occurred just days after Israeli airstrikes killed over 500 people in Lebanon, marking Monday as the deadliest day in the country in nearly 20 years. Hezbollah has not yet commented on the missile aimed at Tel Aviv. Meanwhile, flights at Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv continued without disruption, and sirens were heard in Netanya for the first time since October 7, 2023, according to Israeli authorities.The post Israeli Military Intercepts Rare Missile from Lebanon Near Tel Aviv first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-intercepts-missile-lebanon-near-tel-aviv/	2024-09-25T00:08:44-07:00

In a speech to the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, U.S. President Joe Biden called for a diplomatic resolution as tensions escalate between Israel and Hezbollah. He cautioned against the outbreak of a 'full-scale war' in Lebanon, stressing that such a conflict would not serve anyone's interests. 'While the situation has worsened, there is still a path toward a diplomatic solution,' Biden said. He also urged Israel and Hamas to finalize the ceasefire deal that has been under negotiation for several months, emphasizing his commitment to ending the war in Gaza. 'Now is the time for the parties involved to finalize its terms,' Biden stated, referring to the agreement facilitated by the United States, Qatar, and Egypt. The proposed agreement, he explained, would 'bring the hostages home, ensure security for both Israel and Gaza free from Hamas's control, alleviate the suffering in Gaza, and bring an end to the war,' Biden concluded in his remarks to the UN General Assembly.The post Biden Urges End to Gaza Conflict, Warns of ‘Full-Scale War’ in Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/biden-end-gaza-conflict-warns-full-war-lebanon/	2024-09-25T00:08:34-07:00	
Israeli Strikes Kill 558 in Lebanon, Majority Civilians	Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon on Monday resulted in the deaths of at least 558 people, including 50 children, according to Lebanon's health ministry, making it the deadliest day of cross-border violence since the Gaza war began. The conflict has intensified dramatically, with Arab nations strongly condemning Israel's actions against Hezbollah, marking the highest levels of hostilities in nearly a year. The conflict erupted after Hamas and other Palestinian militants launched a massive attack on Israel on October 7, drawing in Hezbollah and other Iran-backed groups. Israel responded by targeting around 1,600 sites across southern and eastern Lebanon, including a 'targeted strike' in Beirut, as part of what it calls 'Operation Northern Arrows.' Hezbollah confirmed that one of its leaders, Ali Karake, had survived a targeted strike in Beirut after reports suggested he was the target. The group launched a series of missile attacks on Israeli military sites in retaliation, with air raid sirens sounding in the coastal city of Haifa. As of Tuesday, the death toll from Israeli strikes had reached 558, including 50 children, with 1,835 people wounded and taken to hospitals across Lebanon. The strikes also killed four paramedics and injured 16 others, as thousands of families fled their homes. The violence extended to the ancient city of Baalbek in eastern Lebanon, where explosions sent smoke billowing into the sky. The conflict has caused widespread panic, with people fleeing southern Lebanon and seeking shelter in Beirut. Global leaders have urged both Israel and Hezbollah to step back from the brink of all-out war. France and Egypt called for the U.N. Security Council to intervene, while Iraq requested an urgent meeting of Arab states. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant described the current escalation as a 'significant peak' in operations against Hezbollah, claiming it was the group's 'most difficult week' since its founding. Hezbollah, in response, launched rocket attacks on Israeli military sites near Haifa and other bases. The group's actions follow the death of one of its commanders, Ibrahim Akil, in an Israeli strike last Friday. Since the beginning of cross-border exchanges between Hezbollah and Israel in October, tens of thousands of people have fled their homes on both sides. Israeli officials stated that their goal is to reduce threats from Hezbollah by pushing the group back from the border and destroying its infrastructure. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati called on the international community to prevent Israel from carrying out what he described as a plan to destroy Lebanese villages and towns. As the situation worsens, U.S. President Joe Biden emphasized that Washington is working to de-escalate the conflict to allow people to safely return to their homes. The Pentagon announced the deployment of additional military personnel to the Middle East, while a U.S. official expressed opposition to an Israeli ground invasion targeting Hezbollah. Global leaders, including the G7 foreign ministers, have warned of the 'unimaginable consequences' of a potential regional war. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell stated that Israel and Hezbollah are on the verge of a 'full-fledged war.' U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed deep concern over civilian casualties in Lebanon, while the U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon warned of 'far-reaching and devastating consequences' if the violence continues. Qatar, which has been involved in mediation efforts in Gaza, condemned Israel's strikes on Lebanon, warning that the region is 'on the brink of the abyss.' Turkey echoed these concerns, warning of potential chaos, while Jordan called for an immediate end to the escalation. The Palestinian foreign ministry also condemned the Israeli strikes and sent medical support to assist those wounded in Lebanon. Iran's newly elected president, Masoud Pezeshkian, accused Israel of attempting to create a broader conflict.The post Israeli Strikes Kill 558 in Lebanon, Majority Civilians first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strikes-kill-558-lebanon-majority-civilians/	2024-09-24T07:01:50-07:00	
Hezbollah Strikes Kiryat Shmona, Deep Inside Israel, 'Defending L...	Hezbollah launched a barrage of rockets at Kiryat Shmona in northern Israel on Tuesday, claiming the attack was carried out 'in defense of Lebanon.' This came after Israeli forces had bombed numerous targets in southern Lebanon overnight. Hezbollah also targeted Israeli military bases, including the Megiddo military airport, the Ramat David air base near Haifa, and other strategic sites, with volleys of Fadi-1 and Fadi-2 rockets. Earlier, 180 Hezbollah projectiles and an unmanned aerial vehicle crossed into Israeli airspace, triggering alarms and causing residents of Haifa to seek shelter. In response, Israel conducted further airstrikes on Lebanon, marking the deadliest bombardment since the 2006 war, which killed 492 people, including 35 children, according to Lebanon’s health ministry. Israel’s military confirmed that it struck dozens of Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon, including areas around Ayta al-Shab and Ramyah, using artillery, tanks, and airpower. Throughout Tuesday morning, 110 rockets were launched from Lebanon into northern Israel, igniting fires and damaging buildings. The largest rocket volley of 50 rockets targeted the Upper Galilee, with other attacks hitting areas south of Haifa. In northern Israel, sirens blared, and explosions were reported along highways as civilians sought cover. The Galilee Medical Center treated two individuals with minor injuries from a rocket landing near their vehicle, while others sustained injuries rushing to shelters. Later, ten more rockets fired from Lebanon injured an Israeli reservist, with shrapnel hitting a road in northern Israel. Monday's Israeli air raids in Lebanon led to the deaths of 492 people, including 35 children, and injured over 1,600, with thousands of families fleeing their homes. Journalist Nazir Reda described widespread panic, with people evacuating to Beirut in numbers not seen since the 2006 conflict. Hezbollah and Israel have been locked in near-daily cross-border skirmishes for nearly a year, following the escalation that began on October 7. Monday's strikes were the largest since the 2006 war, which left 1,200 dead in Lebanon, mostly civilians, and 160 Israelis, primarily soldiers. Israel has named its ongoing large-scale operations in Lebanon 'Operation Northern Arrows,' having recently shifted its military focus from Gaza to Lebanon. The rapid escalation has alarmed global leaders, with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressing 'grave alarm,' and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warning that the conflict is nearing a 'full-fledged war.' France and Egypt have called on the U.N. Security Council to intervene, while Iraq has requested an urgent meeting of Arab states in New York. Meanwhile, the Pentagon announced it was deploying additional U.S. military personnel to the Middle East after bolstering the region with warships, fighter jets, and air defense systems. A U.S. official indicated that Washington opposes a potential Israeli ground invasion of Lebanon and has proposed ideas to de-escalate the situation. The G7 foreign ministers warned that 'no country stands to gain' from an escalation, cautioning that a regional war could have 'unimaginable consequences.' The latest violence follows coordinated blasts of communication devices in southern Lebanon last week, which Hezbollah blamed on Israel. The blasts killed 39 people and injured nearly 3,000. Last Friday, an Israeli strike in southern Beirut killed Ibrahim Akil, a senior commander of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force. An Israeli military official stated that Israel’s goal is to 'reduce threats' from Hezbollah, push the group back from the border, and dismantle its infrastructure. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati urged the U.N. and global powers to stop what he described as Israel’s 'plan to destroy Lebanese villages and towns.'

Tens of Thousands' Flee South Lebanon, Seek Shelter in the North	Lebanese families who fled from southern villages sought refuge in makeshift shelters set up in schools in Beirut and Sidon. Those unable to find shelter stayed in cars, parks, or along the seaside corniche. Monday’s intense bombardment forced thousands to evacuate south Lebanon. Hotels in Beirut filled up quickly, and families booked up apartments in the surrounding mountain areas in search of safer accommodations. On social media, some people offered empty apartments or spare rooms, while volunteers set up a kitchen at an empty gas station in Beirut to prepare meals for those displaced. In Baalbek, residents lined up at bakeries and gas stations to stock up on essential supplies, anticipating more strikes on Tuesday, as reported by the state-run National News Agency. The United Nations reported that tens of thousands of people had fled their homes in Lebanon since Monday. 'The number of displaced continues to rise,' U.N. refugee agency spokesman Matthew Saltmarsh said, calling the impact on civilians 'unacceptable.'The post 'Tens of Thousands' Flee South Lebanon, Seek Shelter in the North first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/tens-thousands-flee-lebanon-shelter-north/	2024-09-24T06:45:55-07:00

Al-Mayadeen Journalist Killed in Israeli Airstrike in South Leban...	A journalist from the pan-Arab network Al-Mayadeen was killed in Israeli airstrikes while at his home in southern Lebanon, the network reported on Tuesday. Hadi Al-Sayyed, 22, became the third journalist from the network to lose his life in the ongoing conflict between the Israeli military and Hezbollah. The network stated that he was injured on Monday and succumbed to his injuries the following day. Al-Sayyed worked in the online division of Al-Mayadeen and was at his residence in the town of Burj Rahhal, near Tyre in southern Lebanon, when the airstrike occurred. In November last year, two other members of Al-Mayadeen, correspondent Farah Omar and cameraman Rabih Al-Maamari, were killed in an Israeli strike while covering events in southern Lebanon. Additionally, Reuters video journalist Issam Abdallah was killed in Israeli shelling last October while reporting on clashes in Lebanon alongside colleagues from Al-Jazeera and Agence France-Presse. Although Abdallah’s colleagues were injured in the attack, they survived.The post Al-Mayadeen Journalist Killed in Israeli Airstrike in South Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/al-mayadeen-journalist-killed-israeli-airstrike/	2024-09-24T06:45:20-07:00	
US Engages in UN Talks for Lebanon Solution	Washington is currently holding discussions on the security situation between Lebanon and Israel alongside the United Nations General Assembly, sources informed Sky News Arabia. According to these sources, an Arab foreign ministers' meeting took place in New York to explore solutions that could prevent the escalation into a full-blown conflict in the Middle East. 'Arab countries, in cooperation with France, are engaging with Iran to establish the necessary understandings for a peaceful resolution,' the sources revealed. The efforts being led by U.S. Presidential Envoy Amos Hochstein are reportedly building on agreements made with the Lebanese parliament speaker. These discussions focus on implementing U.N. Resolution 1701 and negotiating a ceasefire, the sources added. U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told MSNBC that diplomacy is the best path to ensuring the safe return of residents in northern Israel, and emphasized that Washington will work on achieving this throughout the week. Sullivan further stated that President Joe Biden would be discussing a ceasefire with global leaders, aiming to prevent the situation from escalating into a wider conflict in the Middle East.

6 Dead, 15 Injured in Israeli Strikes on Dahieh Amid Suspected As...	An Israeli airstrike hit Hezbollah's stronghold in southern Beirut on Tuesday, according to a Lebanese security source. The Israeli military confirmed the 'targeted' strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut. The Lebanese Health Ministry reported that at least six people were killed, and 15 others were injured in the attack. 'A strike targeted two floors of a residential building in the Ghobeiri area,' said the security source, who spoke anonymously due to the sensitive nature of the information. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) stated, 'The IDF conducted a targeted strike in Beirut. More details will follow.' However, they did not provide immediate additional information. Israeli media outlets suggested that the intended target of the 'assassination' was Abou Jawad Harakeh, a key commander in Hezbollah's missile unit. Television reports indicated that the strike hit a building located across from the al-Khansa mosque in the Ghobeiri area.The post 6 Dead, 15 Injured in Israeli Strikes on Dahieh Amid Suspected Assassination Attempt first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/6-dead-15-injured-israeli-strikes-dahieh/	2024-09-24T06:44:47-07:00	
World Leaders Warn of Israel-Hezbollah 'Spiral of Violence'	World leaders on Tuesday raised serious concerns about the possibility of a broader conflict, following Israel’s deadliest airstrikes on Hezbollah in Lebanon in two decades. After nearly a year of cross-border clashes triggered by the Gaza war, Israeli air raids on Monday killed 558 people in Lebanon, including 50 children, according to the Lebanese health ministry. This marks the highest toll since the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, fueling fears of a larger war spreading across the Middle East. 'Tens of Thousands Flee' – UN UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed deep concern over the escalating violence and the growing civilian death toll, including women and children, according to his spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric. Matthew Saltmarsh, a spokesperson for the UN Refugee Agency, reported that 'tens of thousands' of people were displaced overnight, with the numbers continuing to rise. 'Spiral of Violence' – US The United States, a key ally of Israel, cautioned against any ground invasion of Lebanon. 'We do not believe that a ground invasion of Lebanon will help de-escalate tensions or prevent a spiral of violence,' said a senior US official, speaking on condition of anonymity. 'Full-Fledged War' – EU Josep Borrell, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, warned that the region was on the brink of 'full-fledged war.' He expressed concern over the increasing military strikes and civilian casualties, urging all parties to work toward de-escalation. 'Another Gaza' – Iran Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian cautioned that Lebanon must not be turned into another Gaza by Israel. Responding to questions about Iran’s influence over Hezbollah, Pezeshkian emphasized that Hezbollah could not face Israel alone, especially as it receives significant backing from Western nations, including the US and European countries. 'Attacks Against Civilians' – China China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, voiced strong opposition to the attacks on civilians, particularly noting the recent explosion of communications equipment in Lebanon. Foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian later added that China was 'deeply shocked' by the high number of casualties resulting from Israeli military actions. 'Israeli Escalation' – Jordan Jordan’s King Abdullah II called for international intervention to halt what he termed the 'danger of Israeli escalation' in Lebanon. He stressed the need to protect innocent civilians and warned that the entire region could be pulled into a wider war if the violence in Gaza is not stopped. 'Brink of the Abyss' – Qatar Qatar condemned the Israeli strikes on Lebanon, warning that the ongoing escalation could push the region 'to the brink of the abyss.' Qatar, a mediator in the Gaza ceasefire talks, expressed grave concern about the heightened tensions. 'Complete Destabilization' – Russia The Kremlin also voiced concern, with spokesperson Dmitry Peskov describing the situation as 'very dangerous' and warning that the conflict could expand, leading to the 'complete destabilization of the region.' Peskov added that Russia was 'extremely worried' about the situation. This growing alarm from world leaders underscores the urgency of addressing the escalating violence to prevent further destabilization of the Middle East.The post World Leaders Warn of Israel-Hezbollah 'Spiral of Violence' first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/world-leaders-warn-israel-hezbollah-spiral-violence/	2024-09-24T06:44:23-07:00	
Iran’s Guards Bans Pagers after Lebanon Explosions	Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) has instructed its members to cease using communication devices after thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah in Lebanon exploded in attacks last week, two senior Iranian security officials told Reuters. One official revealed that the IRGC is now conducting a large-scale inspection of all devices, not limited to communication equipment, as concerns grow about possible infiltration by Israeli agents. Many of these devices were either homemade or imported from countries like China and Russia. A thorough investigation of personnel, especially mid and high-ranking IRGC members, is underway, examining their bank accounts and travel histories. These inspections come after coordinated attacks in Hezbollah's strongholds, where pager devices detonated on Tuesday, followed by hundreds of walkie-talkies exploding on Wednesday. These incidents resulted in 39 deaths and over 3,000 injuries. Lebanon and Hezbollah have blamed Israel for the attacks, though Israel has neither confirmed nor denied involvement. The IRGC is now using encrypted messaging systems for communication, according to the officials. Iran’s leadership is particularly concerned about the security of its nuclear and missile facilities, which have seen heightened protective measures since last year, following Israel's alleged attempts to sabotage Iran's missile program. The IRGC, a powerful force in Iran, is closely linked to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and oversees the country’s strategic military operations, including through its Al Quds Force, which supports groups such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, and others across the Middle East. Iranian military communication relies heavily on domestically developed, encrypted systems, largely due to Western sanctions. While Iran has previously imported communication equipment from China, Russia, and Japan, the country has largely transitioned to self-developed military-grade systems in recent years. Iran and Israel have been involved in a shadow war for decades, often accusing each other of sabotage and assassination plots. The conflict has intensified alongside the Gaza war, and both nations have exchanged blame for high-profile assassinations in recent months. Israel views Iran as an existential threat, accusing it of trying to develop nuclear weapons, a charge Iran denies. Iran, for its part, does not recognize Israel's right to exist, with Supreme Leader Khamenei repeatedly calling for Israel's destruction.The post Iran’s Guards Bans Pagers after Lebanon Explosions first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/irans-guards-bans-pagers-lebanon-explosions/	2024-09-23T02:29:13-07:00	
Israeli Defense Minister Briefs US on Military Operations Against...	Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, updated his U.S. counterpart, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, on Sunday about the Israeli military’s ongoing operations against Hezbollah. This came after the exchange of the most intense fire between Israel and the Iran-backed group since the Gaza war began. In a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Monday, Gallant shared that he provided Austin with an assessment of Hezbollah’s threats and detailed the Israel Defense Forces' (IDF) efforts to reduce the group's ability to launch attacks against Israeli civilians. Their discussion also covered broader regional concerns and the threats posed by Iran and its allies. The Pentagon noted that Austin and Gallant had also spoken earlier on Sunday, following Hezbollah’s rocket attacks on Israel. During the call, Austin reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to Israel’s right to self-defense and emphasized the importance of finding a diplomatic solution to allow displaced northern Israeli residents to return home. On Monday, Israel’s military conducted 'extensive strikes' on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon and urged civilians to vacate areas where the militant group operates in anticipation of further attacks. For context, prior to twin attacks on Hezbollah's communication devices last week, Israeli officials informed the U.S. about an upcoming operation in Lebanon but did not disclose specifics, according to sources familiar with the matter. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken later clarified that the U.S. was neither informed of the exact details nor involved in these incidents.The post Israeli Defense Minister Briefs US on Military Operations Against Hezbollah first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-defense-minister-briefs-us-operations-hezbollah/	2024-09-23T02:03:39-07:00	
China Urges Citizens to Leave Lebanon and Israel Immediately	China has issued an advisory on Monday urging its citizens in Lebanon and Israel to either evacuate or relocate to safer areas as tensions between Israel and Hezbollah continue to escalate.

Israeli Strikes Claim Three Lives in South Lebanon	Lebanon's health ministry reported that three people were killed on Sunday in separate Israeli strikes on southern Lebanon, while Israel confirmed it was targeting Hezbollah positions in the region. According to the ministry, the fatalities occurred in three different villages in the south. On the same day, Hezbollah announced the deaths of two of its fighters, though it did not specify the exact location of the incidents. In retaliation, the group said it deployed drones loaded with explosives towards two Israeli military positions near the border. Earlier on Sunday, Hezbollah claimed responsibility for launching multiple rockets at military production sites and an airbase close to the northern Israeli city of Haifa. The Israeli military confirmed that overnight, rockets, cruise missiles, and drones were fired towards Israeli territory, mostly from Lebanon. Since the beginning of the Gaza conflict, which was triggered by Hamas' attack on Israel on October 7, Hezbollah has been engaging in near-daily exchanges of fire with Israeli forces in support of Hamas. Tensions have escalated sharply in recent days. On Tuesday and Wednesday, dozens were killed and thousands injured in Lebanon when explosions occurred, involving Hezbollah's communication devices. The group has accused Israel of being behind the attacks, though Israel has not commented. Additionally, on Friday, an Israeli airstrike targeting Hezbollah military leaders in Beirut's southern suburbs killed 45 people, most of whom were civilians, according to the health ministry.The post Israeli Strikes Claim Three Lives in South Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strikes-three-lives-south-lebanon/	2024-09-23T02:01:30-07:00

Shepherd Killed in Bekaa Amid Dozens of Israeli Strikes on Lebano...	Israeli airstrikes struck various parts of southern and eastern Lebanon on Monday, with official reports indicating that at least one civilian was killed. According to Lebanon's National News Agency (NNA), Israeli warplanes carried out over 80 airstrikes within a 30-minute span, particularly targeting the Nabatiyeh district in southern Lebanon. Other strikes were reported in the Tyre region. Simultaneously, intense air raids were carried out in Lebanon’s eastern Bekaa Valley near the Syrian border, including areas around Baalbek and the outskirts of Hermel. The NNA confirmed that these strikes claimed the life of a shepherd and injured two of his family members, along with four others. Hezbollah also reported that one of its fighters had been killed. Correspondents from AFP in both the southern and eastern regions of Lebanon confirmed hearing the sounds of heavy airstrikes. A Hezbollah source noted that the strikes in the Bekaa Valley extended from east to west. Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari issued a warning to civilians living in Lebanese villages near Hezbollah military targets, urging them to evacuate for their own safety. Hagari emphasized that Israel’s military is prepared to launch more extensive and precise strikes on Hezbollah’s military infrastructure, which he said is widely embedded throughout Lebanon. Hezbollah has been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since the October 7 attack by Hamas, which sparked the ongoing conflict in Gaza. In recent days, the escalation between Israel and Hezbollah has intensified, raising concerns over the potential for a broader conflict.The post Shepherd Killed in Bekaa Amid Dozens of Israeli Strikes on Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/shepherd-killed-bekaa-dozens-strikes-lebanon/	2024-09-23T02:00:45-07:00	
Al Jazeera Airs Footage of Israeli Military Shutting Down Ramalla...	Al Jazeera aired live footage of Israeli soldiers entering its offices in Ramallah, located in the occupied West Bank, and ordering the closure of the office for 45 days. The broadcast showed Al Jazeera’s bureau chief, Walid Omary, and other staff members live on air when the soldiers arrived. A soldier informed Omary of a military order to shut down the office for 45 days and instructed the staff to leave the premises immediately. Omary, reading the military order on air, stated that the staff were required to collect their personal belongings and cameras before leaving. Al Jazeera’s Ramallah office has been a vital hub for the network, especially after Israel closed its Jerusalem office in May and confiscated some communication equipment. That earlier move sparked condemnation from the United Nations and various human rights groups, accusing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of undermining press freedoms. Once the Al Jazeera staff had vacated the Ramallah office, live footage showed Omary and others standing outside on the street, with Omary reporting that soldiers had taken control of the office and were seizing materials. Shortly thereafter, as Israeli soldiers approached Omary, the live feed was cut, and Omary could be heard saying that the soldiers had confiscated the camera and broadcast equipment the team had been using. CNN has reached out to both Al Jazeera and the Israeli military for comment.The post Al Jazeera Airs Footage of Israeli Military Shutting Down Ramallah Office first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/al-jazeera-footage-israeli-shutting-ramallah-office/	2024-09-22T00:07:55-07:00	
Israel Shuts Schools and Limits Gatherings in the North	Israel has implemented new restrictions on public activities in northern regions, including parts of the Golan Heights, as tensions with Hezbollah intensify.

These measures follow a previous military warning about the potential for a Hezbollah attack in the near future, as hostilities in the region continue to escalate.The post Israel Shuts Schools and Limits Gatherings in the North first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-shuts-schools-limits-gatherings-north/	2024-09-22T00:05:08-07:00	
Breaking: Israeli Army Launches Airstrikes in Southern Lebanon	The Israeli military reported that late Saturday, dozens of warplanes were conducting strikes on Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon, as cross-border clashes intensified, raising concerns about a broader conflict. Israel also implemented additional security measures for its northern region. Military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari stated in a televised address shortly after 8:00 pm (1700 GMT) that Israeli forces were conducting extensive operations in southern Lebanon after identifying Hezbollah’s plans to launch attacks on Israeli territory. 'Dozens of air force aircraft are currently targeting terrorist sites and launchers to neutralize threats against Israeli civilians,' he said. Another wave of airstrikes was launched approximately three hours later. Earlier, Israel claimed to have targeted thousands of Hezbollah rocket launchers and other military assets. This escalation came a day after an Israeli airstrike in southern Beirut killed 37 people, including senior Hezbollah commanders, according to Lebanese officials. The strike followed a series of sabotage attacks on communication devices used by Hezbollah earlier in the week, which killed 39 people and injured around 3,000. Hezbollah attributed the attacks to Israel, although Israel has not confirmed its involvement. Hezbollah has been launching cross-border assaults on Israel following Hamas’ unprecedented attack on southern Israel on October 7, which sparked the current war in Gaza. Thousands of people have been displaced on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border due to the hostilities. On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expanded the objectives of Israel’s military campaign to include the return of displaced residents in northern Israel. Rear Admiral Hagari warned that there could be further rocket launches and other threats against Israel in the near future. Late Saturday, the Israeli military announced stricter public gathering rules for northern Israel. Outdoor gatherings are now limited to 30 people, while indoor events are capped at 300 participants. Additionally, workplaces and educational institutions can remain open as long as there are adequate shelter facilities available.The post Breaking: Israeli Army Launches Airstrikes in Southern Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-army-airstrikes-southern-lebanon/	2024-09-22T00:02:09-07:00	
Slain Israeli Hostage Held by Hamas in Brutal Conditions Beneath ...	The sisters of an Israeli woman, Eden Yerushalmi, who was kidnapped and later killed by Hamas, have described the 'inhuman' conditions of her captivity, sharing their painful experience with CNN. They have been living through what they call a 'nightmare' since her body was found by the Israeli military in a tunnel in Gaza. Eden was abducted from the Nova music festival during Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel. Her body was one of six recovered by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) late last month. Shani and May, Eden's sisters, recounted to CNN's Anderson Cooper that they had received evidence of Eden being alive on three separate occasions, the last of which was just three weeks before her death. Shani expressed how difficult it has been for the family, saying, 'It feels like we’re in a nightmare&#8230; We truly believed Eden would come back home alive.' According to details shared by the IDF after her body was returned, Eden had been held captive in a narrow, windowless tunnel with no air or light, along with limited food. The captives could only sleep in a line and had to use a bucket as a toilet. Eden’s body, found in a Hamas-controlled tunnel under Rafah, showed signs of brutal treatment. The IDF informed the family that she was shot at close range and bore marks on her hands, indicating she tried to defend herself. The deaths of Eden and five other Israeli captives have sparked widespread anger in Israel, particularly directed at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government for its handling of the crisis. Israeli officials reported that more than 1,200 people were killed, and 250 taken hostage during the October 7 attack, while over 40,000 Palestinians have been killed since the conflict began. Eden, along with Hersh Goldberg-Polin and Carmel Gat, had been listed for release as part of a humanitarian agreement between Israel and Hamas. However, delays in executing the deal have stirred controversy, with some blaming the Israeli government. Eden was a 23-year-old Pilates instructor and bartender at the Nova music festival. On the day of the attack, she sent a video of the rocket fire to her family, saying she was leaving the festival. She stayed in contact with her sisters for four hours as she tried to escape, until her final message: 'They’ve caught me.' Her sister May, who chose to see Eden's body after its return, said, 'We gave her a last hug to say goodbye&#8230; She was so thin, we could feel her bones sticking out,' with the autopsy revealing she weighed just 79 pounds. The sisters remembered Eden as a kind and warm-hearted person, with May adding, 'The most important thing is that she was a hero, and she survived 11 months in those tunnels.'The post Slain Israeli Hostage Held by Hamas in Brutal Conditions Beneath Gaza first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/slain-israeli-hostage-hamas-brutal-conditions-gaza/	2024-09-21T03:09:32-07:00

Additionally, three Syrian nationals were among those killed, while 68 people were reported injured. Hezbollah has also confirmed that at least 16 of its members, including high-ranking commanders, died in the airstrike, which took place on Friday. Rescue teams were still working to clear the rubble on Saturday, searching for missing persons. Abiad noted that some of the body parts recovered were unidentifiable. The minister also updated the death toll from the earlier explosions targeting Hezbollah members via pagers and walkie-talkies, which had risen to 39: 12 people died on Tuesday and 27 more on Wednesday.The post Israeli Strike on South Beirut Kills Hezbollah Commander, Death Toll Climbs to 31 first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strike-beirut-death-toll-31/	2024-09-21T03:09:15-07:00	
Hezbollah Commander Ibrahim Akil Reportedly Targeted in Dahieh St...	Ibrahim Akil, whom Israel claimed to have killed in an airstrike on Beirut’s southern suburbs on Friday, was the head of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan unit and had been on a U.S. sanctions list for nearly a decade. The United States had identified Akil as a 'key leader' within Hezbollah and had offered a $7 million reward for information about him. His death marks the second time in nearly a year that a top Hezbollah commander has been killed during ongoing clashes between the militant group and Israel related to the Gaza conflict. Like many of Hezbollah’s military leaders, little was publicly known about Akil, who was referred to by his alias, Hajj Abdul Qader, within the group. According to a source close to Hezbollah, Akil was the second-highest military leader after Fouad Shukur, who was killed by an Israeli airstrike in Beirut’s southern stronghold on July 30. Lebanese officials have reported that Israel has repeatedly demanded, through international intermediaries, that Hezbollah’s Radwan Force, which leads the group’s ground operations, be moved away from the border. Radwan Unit and Akil's Role The Radwan Force is Hezbollah’s most powerful offensive unit, with its fighters trained in cross-border operations, according to a source close to the group. Some of these fighters have combat experience beyond Lebanon, including in Syria, where Hezbollah has openly supported President Bashar al-Assad’s forces since 2013. The U.S. Treasury previously stated that Akil 'played a vital role' in Hezbollah’s Syrian campaign. Since October, Hezbollah has lost two of its three regional commanders in southern Lebanon, Mohammed Naameh Nasser, who was killed in July by an Israeli airstrike, and Taleb Abdallah, who died in a strike a month earlier. Additionally, the Radwan Force lost commander Wissam Tawil in January. Akil was also a member of Hezbollah’s Jihad Council, the group’s highest military authority. The U.S. Treasury described him as a 'principal member' of the Islamic Jihad Organization, a Hezbollah-affiliated group responsible for the 1983 U.S. embassy bombing in Beirut, which killed 63 people, and the same year’s bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks, which killed 241 soldiers. In the late 1980s, Akil was involved in the kidnapping of two German nationals and bombings in Paris in 1986. He was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury as a terrorist in 2015, and in 2019, the U.S. State Department designated him as a 'Specially Designated Global Terrorist.'The post Hezbollah Commander Ibrahim Akil Reportedly Targeted in Dahieh Strike first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-ibrahim-akil-targeted-dahieh-strike/	2024-09-21T03:09:02-07:00

Outrage Flares After Deadly Israeli Strike on Dahieh	Israel announced that it had killed the commander of Hezbollah's elite Radwan unit in a strike on Friday, which Lebanese officials reported left 12 people dead and many others wounded in Hezbollah's stronghold in Beirut. Iranian Embassy Condemns the Attack Following the strike, the Iranian embassy in Lebanon condemned what it called 'Israeli madness' after the assault on Hezbollah’s stronghold in southern Beirut. The embassy stated, 'We strongly condemn the Israeli madness and arrogance that has gone beyond all limits by targeting residential areas in Beirut's southern suburbs.' Hamas Labels the Strike a 'Brutal Escalation' Hamas also condemned the Israeli strike, calling it a 'brutal' escalation. The group’s statement denounced the attack, saying, 'We condemn the brutal and terrorist aggression launched by the Zionist enemy's military on the southern suburb of Beirut,' referring to the incident as an escalation of Israeli aggression. United Nations Expresses Concern and Calls for Restraint The United Nations expressed deep concern over the heightened tensions following the Israeli strikes in Beirut. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric, urged all parties to show 'maximum restraint' and called for immediate de-escalation, stating, 'We are very concerned about the intensified escalation&#8230; including today's deadly strikes in Beirut.'The post Outrage Flares After Deadly Israeli Strike on Dahieh first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/outrage-deadly-israeli-strike-dahieh/	2024-09-21T03:08:35-07:00	
Trump Calls US Election 'Most Important' for Israel’s Future	Former President Donald Trump characterized the upcoming U.S. election as critically significant for Israel, warning that Israel could be 'eradicated,' 'wiped off the face of the earth,' and 'cease to exist' if Vice President Kamala Harris were to become president. During an event focused on antisemitism in the U.S., Trump expressed frustration over what he perceived as a lack of sufficient support from Jewish voters, despite his policies favoring Israel. He urged Jewish voters to prioritize defeating Harris. 'You must defeat Kamala Harris more than anyone else,' Trump told Jewish audience members, adding emphatically that it was crucial for Israel's interests. He also pledged to 'make Israel great again.' In response, Amy Spitalnick, CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs and a former aide to Democratic officials in New York, criticized Trump for using the antisemitism event as a platform to propagate antisemitic stereotypes and attack the American Jewish community. She noted that politicizing Jews and Israel in such a manner jeopardizes the safety of Jews, Israel, and the broader community.The post Trump Calls US Election 'Most Important' for Israel’s Future first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/trump-us-election-most-important-israels/	2024-09-20T03:46:12-07:00	
Israel Signals War Readiness with Hezbollah, Escalation Fears Mou...	This week, a series of deadly blasts from pagers and walkie-talkies revealed a significant breach in Hezbollah’s communication networks across Lebanon, resulting in at least 37 fatalities, including children, and injuring over 3,000 individuals. In response to the blasts, Hezbollah has threatened reprisal against Israel, though it remains uncertain how the Iran-supported militia will react given the compromise to their operational security. Israel's Defense Minister has indicated the onset of a 'new era' in its military strategy, suggesting a focus shift towards the north, near the Lebanese border. This statement subtly confirms the military's involvement in the communications equipment explosions. The covert operations executed this week pose a risk of escalating tensions in the already volatile region. Here are the key developments: Cross-border Engagements Significant military exchanges occurred between Israel and Hezbollah on Thursday. The Israeli military reported targeting around 100 rocket launchers, while Hezbollah claimed at least 17 strikes on Israeli military sites. Israeli Military Activity in Beirut During Nasrallah’s initial speech post-attacks, Israel conducted low altitude flights over Beirut, releasing flares and causing sonic booms, an event captured live by CNN’s Ben Wedeman. Retaliation Promises Hezbollah leader Nasrallah has sternly condemned the covert strikes on communication devices, declaring that Israel has breached critical limits and promising forthcoming retaliation. Iran’s Stance The Revolutionary Guard Corps Commander Hossein Salami of Iran conveyed to Nasrallah that Israel will face a potent and decisive retaliation from the 'axis of resistance,' a coalition of Shia militias across four Middle Eastern nations. Hezbollah’s Capabilities Known as the most heavily armed non-state actor globally, Hezbollah now finds its reputation for being well-equipped and disciplined compromised due to the device attacks. International Reaction A panel of United Nations experts has criticized the attacks on communication devices, labeling them as serious violations of international law and the human right to life, describing these actions as 'terrifying.'The post Israel Signals War Readiness with Hezbollah, Escalation Fears Mount first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-war-readiness-hezbollah-escalation-fears/	2024-09-20T03:44:27-07:00	
Nasrallah Promises Fierce Retaliation to Israel	Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah declared on Thursday that Israel will face severe consequences for the explosions of communication devices that resulted in 37 deaths and nearly 3,000 injuries over the past two days. In his first public address following the incidents, Nasrallah promised that Israel would encounter 'stern retribution and just punishment' both in expected and unexpected forms. He chose not to disclose any specifics regarding the timing, location, or method of Hezbollah's intended response. During his televised speech, Israeli fighter jets were reported to disrupt the calm over Beirut, flying at low altitudes and deploying flares designed to mislead heat-seeking missiles. Nasrallah also spoke directly to Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, stating that military actions would not enable the resettlement of displaced northern residents. He emphasized that no form of military escalation or violence would facilitate their return to the border areas. He asserted that the only solution for returning the displaced individuals to their homes in the north lies in ceasing hostilities in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Additionally, Nasrallah announced that Hezbollah is conducting an internal investigation into the blast of hundreds of their operatives' communication devices throughout Lebanon. He acknowledged that these incidents represented a significant and unprecedented setback for Hezbollah but insisted they would not be defeated. Nasrallah revealed that messages indicating the strikes were intended to cease hostilities on the Lebanese front had been received, along with warnings of further actions if the fighting did not stop. Despite this, he reassured that the extensive bombings had not compromised the group's operational capabilities.The post Nasrallah Promises Fierce Retaliation to Israel first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/nasrallah-promises-retaliation-israel/	2024-09-20T03:44:14-07:00	
Israeli Airstrikes Target Hezbollah Following Death of 2 Troops	On Thursday, the Israeli military initiated new assaults on Hezbollah locations in Lebanon, concurrently with the sounding of alert sirens across northern Israel, suggesting possible incoming attacks. The military disclosed that the operations were aimed at diminishing Hezbollah's terrorist capabilities and infrastructure. This action forms part of a broader initiative to enable displaced Israelis to return to their residences in the northern regions. Additionally, the Israeli forces reported the deaths of two soldiers due to rocket strikes from Hezbollah near the northern Lebanese border. The casualties were Reservist Major Nael Fwarsy, aged 43, and Sergeant Tomer Keren, aged 20, who both died in separate encounters, according to military sources. Hezbollah seemed to escalate its retaliatory strikes on Thursday. This increase in hostility followed the explosion of communication devices belonging to thousands of its members across Lebanon, incidents that have been attributed to Israel. These explosions resulted in 37 deaths and nearly 3,000 injuries over a span of two days.The post Israeli Airstrikes Target Hezbollah Following Death of 2 Troops first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-airstrikes-hezbollah-death-2/	2024-09-20T03:43:51-07:00	
Israel Strikes South Lebanon as Hezbollah Escalates Attacks	Israel's military confirmed that its jets targeted approximately 100 Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon during two waves of intense airstrikes overnight. The strikes hit about 100 launchers and additional Hezbollah infrastructure, including around 1,000 barrels that were reportedly set for immediate firing, according to the Israeli army. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported that the southern region was hit at least 52 times during the night, marking one of the most significant bombardments by Israel since the border skirmishes began last October. In response, Hezbollah launched at least 17 attacks on Israeli military sites in northern Israel on Thursday. These developments, including the deadly explosions in Lebanon earlier in the week and Thursday's heavy bombardments, came after Israel declared a shift in its war objectives, focusing on its northern border with Lebanon, where clashes with Hezbollah have intensified. For nearly a year, Israel's military efforts had been concentrated on the Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza. However, it has also been engaged in frequent exchanges of fire with Hezbollah along the northern border. International mediators have been working to prevent a full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah and to contain the regional impact of the conflict in Gaza, which was triggered by Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel. Hezbollah maintains that its attacks are in support of Hamas, and its leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, pledged on Thursday that these attacks will persist as long as the war in Gaza continues. The cross-border exchanges have claimed hundreds of lives in Lebanon, most of them fighters, and dozens in Israel, including soldiers. The ongoing violence has also forced tens of thousands of residents on both sides of the border to flee their homes. During a visit to Israeli troops on Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant warned that Hezbollah 'will pay an increasing price' as Israel seeks to secure the safe return of its citizens to the border areas. 'We are at the start of a new phase in the war,' he said. Iran's Revolutionary Guards also warned Israel of a 'crushing response from the resistance front' following the recent blasts, which injured Tehran's ambassador in Beirut. Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who has been working to facilitate a ceasefire in Gaza and negotiate the release of hostages, called for restraint from all sides, emphasizing the importance of avoiding actions that could escalate the situation. He joined European foreign ministers in Paris to discuss the ongoing crisis. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre reiterated that President Joe Biden believes a diplomatic resolution between Israel and Hezbollah is still possible.The post Israel Strikes South Lebanon as Hezbollah Escalates Attacks first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-strikes-south-lebanon-hezbollah-escalates-attacks/	2024-09-20T03:43:38-07:00	
Taiwan Questions Two in Hezbollah Pager Investigation	Taiwan Questions Two in Hezbollah Pager InvestigaTaiwan Questions Two in He Two individuals from Taiwanese companies were questioned in connection with an investigation into pagers that exploded while being used by Hezbollah operatives in Lebanon, according to investigators on Friday. Top officials in Taiwan have emphasized that the devices were not sourced from the island. The origin and supply of the pagers have been the subject of speculation after hundreds of them, along with walkie-talkies, detonated across Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday, resulting in at least 37 deaths and nearly 3,000 injuries. A report by The New York Times suggested that Israel had inserted explosive material into a shipment of pagers from Taiwan's Gold Apollo, citing anonymous American and other officials. However, Gold Apollo’s head, Hsu Ching-kuang, denied that his company produced the devices in question, attributing the production to Hungary-based partner BAC Consulting KFT, which had been licensed to use Gold Apollo’s trademark. Reports indicated that the second individual questioned was Wu Yu-jen, a representative connected to BAC Consulting KFT, who had established a Taipei-based company called 'Apollo Systems.' Taipei's Shilin District Prosecutors' Office issued a statement on Friday, saying, 'Our country takes this case very seriously.' The office confirmed that two individuals from Taiwanese companies had been interviewed as witnesses and released after multiple rounds of questioning. Authorities also conducted searches in four locations, including Gold Apollo’s site in New Taipei City’s Xizhi district and the Neihu district of Taipei, where Apollo Systems is registered. Wu did not speak to reporters when brought in for questioning on Thursday, according to local news footage. Taiwan's Economic Minister Kuo Jyh-huei told reporters that Gold Apollo's pagers, made in Taiwan, consist of basic components like low-end integrated circuits (IC) and batteries, and he stressed, 'These things would not explode.' He added that the company had exported 260,000 pagers in the past two years without any previous incidents of explosions. Kuo assured that the pagers used by Hezbollah were not produced in Taiwan. Premier Cho Jung-tai also reiterated on Friday that neither the company nor Taiwan had directly exported pagers to Lebanon. Earlier this week, Gold Apollo clarified that the pager model mentioned in media reports was produced and sold by BAC. However, a Hungarian government spokesperson stated that BAC Consulting KFT is merely a trading intermediary with no manufacturing or operational site in Hungary. zbollah Pager InvestigationtionThe post Taiwan Questions Two in Hezbollah Pager Investigation first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/taiwan-questions-two-hezbollah-pager-investigation/	2024-09-20T03:43:27-07:00	
It is Fake News that Bulgaria is Linked to Exploding Devices in L...	Multiple fake news articles continously appear throughout the web that Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, has connections to the heart-breaking events in Lebanon. International investigators have ruled out the possibility of explosive devices being transported through Bulgaria. Experts say that Bulgarian connection to this event is fake news. In a statement released by the Bulgarian authorities and National Security State Agency, is stated that 'After thorough internal investigations, no customs procedures involving communication devices (pagers) have been processed through Bulgarian territory.' Fake news have been traced back to a Hungarian news website which blames a Bulgarian company, called Norta Global Ltd, to have delivered the devices to Lebanon from Bulgaria. Meanwhile, Hungarian government authorities and private Hungarian media websites have been flagged by the West to have strong support for the Russian president Vladimir Putin. Victor Orban has been repeatedly accused of being the only supporter of the Russian aggression inside the EU. The statement came in response to media reports suggesting that a company based in Bulgaria had supplied Hezbollah in Lebanon with the devices that later exploded in Lebanon and Syria. The Sofia-based company in question, Norta Global Ltd., owned by a Norwegian citizen, has been manipulatively linked to the sale of these devices by the Hungarian media. It is not the first time that Russian propaganda has been supported by third party members, in order to blame countries that support the Ukrainian defence. Western investigators are currently conducting joint investigations with the National Revenue Agency and the Bulgarian Ministry of Interior into the possible involvement of a Bulgarian-registered company in supplying communication equipment to Hezbollah. No physical proof has been found that Bulgarian citizens are connected to the sale of the devices. However, there are numerous fake articles in the web on this topic. Norta Global Ltd. was registered in April 2022 as a project management company. However, there is no evidence that the company manufactures products, and no financial records have been found. The company shares its registered address in downtown Sofia and it is currently non-operational. The owner of the company is the Norwegian citizen Rinson Jose, who also has a different company in Hungary. Hezbollah received thousands of pagers as part of a move to create a more secure communication network. This distribution increased significantly after Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah advised members to steer clear of cellphones, labeling them as tools of Israeli surveillance, and recommended pagers as a more secure option. At the same time, walkie-talkies that detonated on Wednesday were acquired around the same time as the pagers, back in April. Icom Inc., a Japanese company that manufactures the handheld radios in question, stated that the models in question were discontinued about ten years ago. The company is currently investigating and confirmed on Thursday that their IC-V82 radios had been shipped to the Middle East between 2004 and 2014. These unusual incidents, which Hezbollah has blamed on Israel, have left the Lebanese public in shock. According to the Saudi Al Hadath network, citing Iranian sources, many are now hastily discarding their wireless devices, as the walkie-talkies that exploded on Wednesday are also commonly used in Iran.The post It is Fake News that Bulgaria is Linked to Exploding Devices in Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/fake-news-that-bulgaria-is-linked-to-exploding-devices-in-lebanon/	2024-09-19T13:37:14-07:00

White House Warns of ‘Escalation’ in Mideast Following Lebanon Bl...	The White House has urged all parties to avoid escalating the conflict in the Middle East following two days of explosions in Lebanon, widely linked to Israel, targeting Hezbollah with handheld devices. 'We do not want to see any further escalation. We believe the solution to the current crisis is not through more military action,' National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Wednesday. Kirby emphasized that diplomacy remains the best path to avoid opening another front in Lebanon, which could further complicate the situation. Iran, a supporter of Hezbollah, has refrained from a major response following an attack in Tehran that killed a senior Hamas leader. Since Hamas' October 7 assault, Israel has engaged in ongoing clashes with Hezbollah, which also receives backing from Iran. When asked about whether Israel was complying with international humanitarian law in the attacks on pagers and walkie-talkies in Lebanon, Kirby said, 'As we've maintained from the beginning, Israel has a right to defend itself.' He added that the U.S. continues to communicate with Israel about how they conduct their operations but did not confirm Israel's involvement in the blasts. Kirby reiterated that the U.S. had no involvement in the incidents: 'We were not involved in yesterday's or today's events in any way.'The post White House Warns of ‘Escalation’ in Mideast Following Lebanon Blasts first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/white-house-warns-escalation-in-mideast-lebanon-blasts/	2024-09-19T03:59:23-07:00

The Israeli military announced on Thursday that it had carried out strikes on six Hezbollah 'terrorist infrastructure sites' and a weapons storage facility in southern Lebanon overnight, amid growing concerns of an escalating conflict. In a statement, the military said that its air force targeted Hezbollah positions in the areas of Chihine, Taybeh, Blida, Mays al-Jabal, Aitaroun, and Kfarkela in southern Lebanon. Additionally, a Hezbollah weapons storage site in Khiam was also hit. In retaliation, Hezbollah attacked Israeli soldiers stationed at the al-Marj post in northern Israel. Israeli media reported that several individuals were injured in Ya’ara following suicide drone attacks launched from Lebanon. Several other drones hit Beit Hillel, near Kiryat Shmona, sparking fires but causing no injuries, according to the Israeli army.The post Suicide Drones Hit Northern Israel, Causing Injuries and Sparking Fire first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/drones-hit-northern-israel-injuries-fire/	2024-09-19T03:59:11-07:00

Top diplomats from the United States, Britain, Germany, France, and Italy are set to meet in Paris on Thursday to address the escalating tensions in the Middle East, sources revealed on Wednesday. The gathering comes amid increasing fears of a broader regional conflict, as violence in Gaza intensifies and Lebanon experiences two days of explosive attacks, which Hezbollah has blamed on Israel. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will join his counterparts from these allied nations in the French capital following talks in Cairo focused on a possible truce in Gaza. Blinken's visit aims to revive stalled negotiations, mediated by Egypt, Qatar, and the U.S., to bring an end to the ongoing conflict. He emphasized that a ceasefire in Gaza would be the most effective way to prevent further violence from spreading throughout the region. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani, who confirmed his attendance, also noted that discussions would include the ongoing war in Ukraine.The post US, European Diplomats to Tackle Mideast Tensions Thursday in Paris first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-european-diplomats-tackle-mideast-tensions-paris/	2024-09-19T03:59:00-07:00

Blinken Arrives in Egypt to Push for Gaza Ceasefire	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Cairo on Wednesday in an effort to revive ceasefire negotiations for Gaza, a process made more difficult by recent explosions targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon. This marked Blinken's 10th trip to the Middle East since the Gaza conflict began nearly a year ago. During his visit, he met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and planned a press conference with Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty. However, there are no plans for him to travel to other Arab capitals or Israel. According to the U.S. State Department, the primary focus of Blinken’s visit was discussing the ongoing negotiation efforts with Egyptian officials. Although U.S. officials privately acknowledged they did not expect significant breakthroughs, Blinken aimed to sustain pressure for a potential agreement between Israel and Hamas. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller emphasized the importance of moving toward a deal without further delays, while avoiding any specific timeline for a proposal. The key sticking points include Israel's refusal to withdraw from the Philadelphi corridor on the Egypt-Gaza border and new demands from Hamas regarding the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. Blinken’s visit also came after explosions hit Hezbollah members' pagers across Lebanon, killing at least nine and injuring 2,800 others, an attack that Hezbollah blamed on Israel. Israel has not commented on the blasts, but had earlier stated it was broadening its war aims to include targeting Hezbollah. While in Cairo, Blinken is also expected to discuss strengthening U.S.-Egypt relations. Egypt, although frequently accused of human rights abuses, remains a key U.S. partner. Last week, Washington released $1.3 billion in military aid to Egypt without imposing rights conditions, unlike the previous year. After his Cairo visit, Blinken is scheduled to travel to Paris to brief officials from France, Britain, and Italy.The post Blinken Arrives in Egypt to Push for Gaza Ceasefire first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/blinken-arrives-egypt-push-gaza-ceasefire/	2024-09-18T02:27:06-07:00	
Nasrallah to Address Nation Thursday Following Pager Blasts	Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah is set to deliver a speech on Thursday, following a series of explosions involving pagers used by Hezbollah members across Lebanon. According to a statement released by Hezbollah on Wednesday, Nasrallah will address 'the latest developments' in a speech scheduled for 5:00 pm (1400 GMT). In response to the deadly explosions, which the group has blamed on Israel, Hezbollah reaffirmed its commitment to ongoing operations in support of Gaza. The group stated, 'This path is ongoing and separate from the difficult reckoning that the criminal enemy must await for its massacre on Tuesday,' referencing the recent attacks. The speech is expected to touch on these incidents and Hezbollah's continued activities amid the current regional tensions.The post Nasrallah to Address Nation Thursday Following Pager Blasts first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/nasrallah-address-nation-pager-blasts/	2024-09-18T02:26:41-07:00	
Taiwan’s Gold Apollo Blames Hungary for Exploding Pagers	Gold Apollo, a Taiwanese company, confirmed on Wednesday that it had authorized the use of its brand on the pagers involved in recent explosions in Lebanon and Syria, though the devices were actually manufactured by BAC Consulting KFT, a company based in Budapest. These pagers, which were primarily used by Hezbollah, detonated nearly simultaneously on Tuesday, leading to the deaths of at least nine people, including an 8-year-old girl, and wounding nearly 3,000 others. Hezbollah and the Lebanese government have accused Israel of orchestrating the attack, which appears to have been a sophisticated remote operation. An anonymous U.S. official revealed that Israel had briefed the U.S. after the operation's conclusion, stating that small explosives hidden inside the pagers had been remotely triggered. In a statement on Wednesday, Gold Apollo explained that while it allowed BAC to use its brand in specific regions, the design and manufacturing of the pagers were entirely BAC's responsibility. The AR-924 pager model, involved in the explosions, was known for its rugged build and long battery life, critical features in a country like Lebanon, where power outages are frequent. The attacks primarily targeted areas where Hezbollah holds significant influence, such as southern Beirut and the Beqaa region in eastern Lebanon. Hezbollah responded by reaffirming its commitment to continuing its strikes against Israel as part of its ongoing support for Hamas and Palestinians in Gaza. The group also vowed retaliation for what they termed a 'massacre' committed by Israel. The blasts caused chaos across Beirut, with hospitals overwhelmed by patients suffering severe injuries, particularly to the eyes and limbs. Lebanon's Health Minister, Firas Abiad, reported that several countries, including Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Egypt, had offered assistance in treating the injured. Medical supplies and equipment were flown into Beirut, including 15 tons delivered by an Iraqi military plane. Experts believe that the explosives were inserted into the pagers before they were distributed to Hezbollah, highlighting the sophisticated nature of the supply chain infiltration. The use of pagers, as opposed to mobile phones, had been a deliberate strategy by Hezbollah to avoid Israeli electronic surveillance. In the past, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah had warned of the dangers of mobile phones being used as surveillance tools.The post Taiwan’s Gold Apollo Blames Hungary for Exploding Pagers first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/gold-apollo-blames-hungary-exploding-pagers/	2024-09-18T02:26:30-07:00
