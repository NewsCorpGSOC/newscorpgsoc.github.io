UN General Assembly Calls for Gaza Ceasefire	The United Nations General Assembly recently passed a resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, amidst the escalating violence that has deeply affected civilians. This resolution highlights the urgent need for international action to protect innocent lives, provide humanitarian aid, and release hostages, while urging all parties to comply with international law. Overwhelming support for the ceasefire came from 153 countries, reflecting the global call for an end to the ongoing violence. The situation in Gaza has escalated to alarming levels, with the humanitarian crisis worsening every day. Millions of Palestinians are facing dire conditions, with over 80% of Gaza's population displaced. The bombardment and blockade imposed by Israel have led to the deaths of more than 18,000 people, and the civilian toll continues to rise. Critics argue that Israel’s actions violate international law, while supporters emphasize Israel’s right to defend itself, albeit under the constraints of international humanitarian law. Despite calls from the UN for a ceasefire, some nations, including the United States, have faced challenges in securing unanimous international support due to political differences. The international community, however, is united in its concern for Gaza’s children, with many calling the ongoing situation a potential 'genocide' and highlighting the severe toll on young lives. This resolution marks a critical moment for global diplomacy and humanitarian intervention, as the world watches closely to see if the ceasefire will hold and bring relief to the suffering population in Gaza.The post UN General Assembly Calls for Gaza Ceasefire first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/un-general-assembly-calls-gaza-ceasefire/	2024-12-12T04:14:09-08:00	
Israel to Stay in Syria Buffer Zone Until Border Security Secured	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has confirmed that Israeli forces will remain in a Syrian buffer zone until a new security force is established on the Syrian side of the border to ensure stability. This action follows the upheaval caused by the ousting of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, which led to the emergence of a power vacuum along the border. In response, Israel's military seized control of additional strategic points near its border, with the aim of preventing jihadi groups from taking advantage of the instability. Netanyahu's office emphasized that Israel would not allow these groups to threaten the security of its communities, particularly in the Golan Heights, a region Israel captured from Syria in 1967 and later annexed. While the international community generally considers the Golan Heights as occupied Syrian territory, Israel maintains its claim over the region. The Israeli military's presence in the buffer zone is described as temporary, with the intention of handing over control once a security force that is committed to the 1974 disengagement agreement can be formed. Until then, Israeli forces will remain in place to maintain order and prevent any further threats.The post Israel to Stay in Syria Buffer Zone Until Border Security Secured first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-stay-syria-buffer-zone-border-secured/	2024-12-12T04:14:00-08:00	
Blinken Kicks Off Syria Crisis Tour with Arrival in Jordan	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Jordan on Thursday to begin a diplomatic mission in the wake of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's removal from power. Blinken's first stop was Aqaba, where he met with King Abdullah II and Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi to discuss the rapidly changing situation in Syria. He is also scheduled to travel to Turkey on Friday for further talks with Turkish officials. While the main focus of these discussions will be Syria, the ongoing conflict in Gaza, which has caused significant destruction since October 2023, will also be addressed. Blinken's visit follows a series of high-level U.S. engagements in the region in response to Assad's ouster. U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan and a senior military commander have already visited the Middle East in recent days. This comes amid ongoing airstrikes by the U.S. and Israel aimed at countering the Islamic State group and securing chemical weapons to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands. During his meetings, Blinken is expected to emphasize the importance of a peaceful transition in Syria that respects the rights of minority groups, facilitates humanitarian aid, and ensures Syria does not become a haven for terrorism or pose a threat to neighboring countries. The U.S. has expressed its willingness to support a new Syrian government that meets these criteria, particularly if it can secure and eliminate chemical weapons stockpiles. Despite the ongoing shifts, U.S. officials clarified that they are not actively reconsidering the terrorist designation of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Syrian rebel group with historical ties to al-Qaida. However, they remain open to dialogue with its members, even as they stress that HTS is still considered a foreign terrorist organization.The post Blinken Kicks Off Syria Crisis Tour with Arrival in Jordan first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/blinken-kicks-syria-crisis-tour-jordan/	2024-12-12T04:13:48-08:00	
Israel Targets Syria’s Latakia and Tartus in Airstrikes	Israel recently carried out airstrikes targeting Syria’s Latakia and Tartus regions, two significant areas close to the Mediterranean coast. These airstrikes have been reported to have destroyed key military installations, including suspected Iranian weapon caches and storage sites. The strikes hit near a Russian naval base in Tartus, further complicating the regional dynamics, as Russia maintains a presence in Syria and is a key ally of the Assad regime. The airstrikes are part of Israel’s ongoing strategy to weaken Iran’s influence in Syria and prevent the transfer of advanced weapons to Hezbollah, Iran's proxy group. Israel has frequently targeted these sites, particularly in regions where Iran is believed to be enhancing its military footprint. The latest attacks also come in the wake of heightened tensions following the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime. These actions underscore Israel’s ongoing concerns about the growing military presence of Iran in Syria, which it views as a direct threat to its national security. While Israel has refrained from officially commenting on the specific targets of these strikes, military sources have indicated that the operations were aimed at preventing the establishment of a permanent Iranian military infrastructure near Israel’s border. This series of strikes also highlights the complexities of the ongoing Syrian conflict and the involvement of various foreign powers, including Russia and Iran, in shaping the future of the region.The post Israel Targets Syria’s Latakia and Tartus in Airstrikes first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-targets-syrias-latakia-tartus-airstrikes/	2024-12-12T04:13:29-08:00	
US Announces First Israeli Withdrawal from Lebanon Under Ceasefir...	On December 12, 2024, a significant development unfolded in southern Lebanon as Israel began withdrawing its forces from the border region of Khiam. This move follows a ceasefire agreement brokered by the United States, which aims to bring an end to the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah that has devastated the region since October 2023. The Israeli withdrawal, confirmed by both Israeli military officials and U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), is part of a larger deal requiring Israeli forces to vacate southern Lebanon by the end of January 2025. This marked the first phase of the withdrawal under the ceasefire arrangement. The Lebanese Army has since deployed units in the town of Khiam, a strategic border area, to ensure security and maintain stability, with the assistance of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati lauded this step, emphasizing it as vital for strengthening Lebanon's military presence in the south and supporting national stability. The deployment of Lebanese forces in the area is expected to continue in phases as the region transitions to a more secure environment. This ceasefire agreement is seen as a crucial first step toward a broader cessation of hostilities. It follows an earlier statement from U.S. General Erik Kurilla, who noted that this shift marks a pivotal moment for long-term peace prospects in the region.The post US Announces First Israeli Withdrawal from Lebanon Under Ceasefire Deal first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-israeli-withdrawal-lebanon-ceasefire-deal/	2024-12-12T04:13:15-08:00

The Biden administration has announced its intention to recognize and support a new Syrian government that disavows terrorism, eliminates chemical weapons, and upholds the rights of minorities and women. Secretary of State Antony Blinken emphasized that the U.S. would collaborate with various groups within Syria and regional allies to ensure a smooth transition from the ousted regime of President Bashar Assad. However, he did not specify which groups would be involved. Blinken reiterated that the future of Syria should be determined by the Syrian people, with other nations encouraged to support a transparent and inclusive process without interference. He assured that the U.S. would recognize and fully back a Syrian government that emerges from this process, offering support to the country’s diverse communities.The post US Will Recognize Syria If It Renounces Terror, Protects Minorities first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-recognize-syria-renounces-terror/	2024-12-11T10:09:11-08:00	
Berri Meets Bassil and Quint Ambassadors to Discuss Presidential ...	Ambassadors from a five-nation group consisting of the U.S., France, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt met with Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri in Ain el-Tineh on Wednesday to discuss the upcoming presidential election. Egyptian Ambassador to Lebanon, Alaa Moussa, announced that the election session set for January 9 will continue with multiple rounds of voting until a president is elected. U.S. Ambassador Lisa Johnson expressed optimism, saying she felt 'positive' about the situation. This session aims to resolve Lebanon's more than two-year-long vacancy of the presidency, which has been left unfilled since Michel Aoun's term ended in October 2022. The country's political divisions, particularly between Hezbollah and its opposition, have prevented the election of a new president, with neither side able to secure the necessary majority. Berri confirmed that the session on January 9 will proceed as planned without delay. He emphasized the certainty of electing a president on that date, telling Asharq al-Awsat that there would be no postponement. After meeting with Free Patriotic Movement leader Jebran Bassil, the latter echoed Berri's confidence, expressing optimism that the election process is progressing well. Bassil stated that Lebanon would, 'God willing,' have a president on January 9.The post Berri Meets Bassil and Quint Ambassadors to Discuss Presidential Issue first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/berri-meets-bassil-quint-ambassadors-presidential-issue/	2024-12-11T10:06:27-08:00	
5 Dead in Drone Strikes as Israel’s Violations Persist in South L...	An Israeli drone strike on Wednesday evening targeted the southern Lebanese town of Bint Jbeil, killing three civilians, according to media reports. Machinegun fire was also reported in the area. Earlier in the day, another Israeli drone strike hit a van traveling between the southern towns of Beit Leef and Sribbine, resulting in the death of Lebanese national Hamza Morshed Baddah, as reported by the National News Agency (NNA). Another drone strike earlier in the day targeted a house between Ainata and Bint Jbeil, killing one person and injuring another. In Naqoura, Israeli forces blew up a home and conducted raids in the Wadi Hassan area between Majdal Zoun and Shihin, involving artillery shelling and machinegun fire. Additionally, a 15-member Israeli force entered a home in Burj al-Moulouk, searching the property, interrogating the residents, and confiscating their phones. The family was also ordered to evacuate and not return. This escalation comes after months of cross-border exchanges, particularly following Hezbollah’s support of Hamas after the latter's October 7 attack on Israel. While a ceasefire took effect on November 27, both Israel and Hezbollah have accused each other of violating the agreement. The ceasefire plan includes the Lebanese army deploying in the south, alongside UN peacekeepers, while Israeli forces gradually withdraw. In a separate development, UN peacekeepers entered Khiam to verify Israel's withdrawal. Additionally, international ambassadors met with Lebanese parliament speaker Nabih Berri to discuss the ongoing political deadlock in Lebanon, which has been without a president for over two years.The post 5 Dead in Drone Strikes as Israel’s Violations Persist in South Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/5-dead-drone-strikes-israels-violations-south-lebanon/	2024-12-11T10:06:17-08:00	
Syria’s New Leaders Pledge Respect for Lebanon’s Sovereignty	Syria's new leadership, following the ousting of Bashar al-Assad, has made a significant commitment to respecting Lebanon's sovereignty. In a recent statement, the new interim government emphasized its desire to foster peaceful and cooperative relations with neighboring countries, especially Lebanon, and affirmed its respect for Lebanon's territorial integrity. This pledge is crucial, as both countries have been historically entangled in complex political and military relationships. The new Syrian government, led by former rebel factions, has been working to rebuild the country after over a decade of civil war. The leaders have sought to reassure Lebanon that Syria is committed to maintaining peace and stability in the region, which is crucial for Lebanon's own security and recovery. The tension between these neighboring countries, exacerbated by the Syrian conflict, had often led to border issues, with Syria's internal struggles spilling over into Lebanon. This diplomatic shift comes at a time when Syria is attempting to strengthen its international standing and normalize relationships with other regional players, including Lebanon. The new leadership is also under pressure to prove its commitment to a political and economic recovery, not only within Syria but also in its foreign relations, particularly with Lebanon. This commitment to Lebanon's sovereignty is seen as a positive step by international observers, although it remains to be seen how it will impact the broader geopolitical landscape, especially concerning Syria's relations with other regional powers.The post Syria’s New Leaders Pledge Respect for Lebanon’s Sovereignty first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/syrias-new-leaders-respect-lebanons-sovereignty/	2024-12-11T10:06:05-08:00	
France Demands Israel Pull Back from Syria Buffer Zone	France has officially called on Israel to withdraw its forces from the buffer zone established in Syria, emphasizing the need to respect international borders and uphold Syria's sovereignty. The French government expressed deep concerns about the potential escalation of hostilities in an already unstable region. The buffer zone, which Israel has maintained to prevent arms smuggling to hostile groups, has been a point of contention. French Foreign Minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, stated that continued Israeli presence in the buffer zone undermines efforts towards a peaceful resolution in Syria. He urged for a diplomatic approach to address security concerns without infringing on Syria's territorial integrity. This move is part of broader international efforts to stabilize the Middle East, which has seen a decade-long civil war in Syria with devastating consequences. Israel, however, argues that its military presence in the buffer zone is crucial for its national security. Israeli officials cite the need to prevent the transfer of advanced weaponry to Hezbollah and other groups that pose a direct threat to Israel. They also stress that their actions are defensive measures aimed at curbing Iranian influence in Syria. The international community, including the United Nations, is closely monitoring the situation. UN Secretary-General António Guterres has called for restraint from all parties involved and has urged for dialogue to resolve the issue peacefully. The French demand highlights the delicate balance of maintaining security while respecting sovereign borders in the Middle East. As tensions simmer, the world watches to see if diplomatic efforts can prevent further conflict and bring stability to a region plagued by years of war and unrest. The situation remains fluid, with potential repercussions for broader geopolitical dynamics in the Middle East.The post France Demands Israel Pull Back from Syria Buffer Zone first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/france-israel-pull-back-syria-buffer-zone/	2024-12-11T10:05:55-08:00

Lebanese Freed After 33 Years in Syrian Prisons	A Lebanese man who had spent 33 years in Syrian prisons arrived in his hometown of Chekka on Monday, following his release by Islamist-led rebels. Salim Hamawi became the first Lebanese prisoner to return to Lebanon, although another man, Ali al-Ali, was filmed after being freed from a prison in Hama last week. Ali had been missing for almost 40 years during Lebanon’s civil war. His family had no contact with him, and a Syrian journalist in Hama reported that Ali had lost all memory and could not recognize his own identity. Hamawi, speaking upon his return to Lebanon, explained that he had been arrested for his affiliation with the Christian Lebanese Forces party. He shared that he had lost all hope of ever returning home. Following the release of Ali al-Ali’s video online on Thursday, many Lebanese families began calling for answers about the fate of their relatives who are believed to be detained in Syrian prisons. During Lebanon’s 15-year civil war, approximately 17,000 people went missing, many of whom were either imprisoned or killed in detention centers run by Syrian forces in Lebanon and Syria. The whereabouts of many of these individuals remain uncertain.The post Lebanese Freed After 33 Years in Syrian Prisons first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lebanese-freed-33-years-syrian-prisons/	2024-12-10T01:00:15-08:00	
Watch: Meet Abu Mohammed al-Jolani: The New Face of Post-Assad Sy...	Analysis of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham Leader and His Role in Toppling Assad The recent ousting of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has led to a critical inquiry: who now represents the Syrian populace after decades of oppressive rule? A notable contender for this role is Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), spearheaded by Abu Mohammad al-Jolani. This group played a crucial part in the opposition’s efforts that culminated in Assad’s downfall. Origins and Evolution of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham Hayat Tahrir al-Sham emerged in the early days of the Syrian civil war, which began in 2011 as a widespread uprising against Assad’s authoritarian regime. Initially, HTS was an offshoot of the Nusra Front, the official al-Qaida affiliate in Syria. The group was known for its military prowess and commitment to global jihad, with the aim of establishing strict Islamic rule across the Muslim world. In 2016, the Nusra Front publicly cut ties with al-Qaida and rebranded itself as Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, meaning 'Front for the Conquest of the Levant.' The following year, it merged with several other factions to form Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or the 'Organization for the Liberation of the Levant.' This rebranding was an effort to distance itself from al-Qaida’s global jihadist agenda and to focus more on issues specific to Syrians, such as local governance, economic concerns, and humanitarian aid. Despite these changes, HTS’s core ideology remains rooted in jihadism, with the primary goal of overthrowing the Assad regime and establishing Islamic rule in Syria. Abu Mohammad al-Jolani: A Key Figure Born Ahmed al-Sharaa in 1982 in Saudi Arabia, al-Jolani relocated to Damascus with his family in 1989. His jihadist career began in Iraq following the 2003 US-led invasion, where he joined forces aligned with al-Qaida. In 2011, under the direction of then-al-Qaida in Iraq leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, al-Jolani was tasked with establishing the Nusra Front in Syria, which quickly became a significant force in the civil war. Under al-Jolani’s leadership, HTS has sought to present itself as more pragmatic, focusing on governance issues in Idlib, Syria’s largest rebel stronghold. This shift has been part of al-Jolani’s effort to transition from a jihadist leader to a more politically viable figure in Syrian politics. Al-Jolani’s pragmatic approach since 2017 has been crucial in helping HTS control territories and assert itself as a regional governing force. His recent actions, such as adopting a moderate persona and engaging in public services, reflect his central role in HTS’s military and political evolution, reinforcing the group’s hold on power and efforts to gain legitimacy both locally and internationally. HTS’s Rise to Power in Syria HTS has maintained control over its territories by implementing governance systems that provide stability and services, legitimizing its rule in the eyes of local populations. The group aimed to expand its influence and win international acceptance by minimizing opposition and collaborating with the broader Syrian revolutionary movement. This involved working with other actors in Syria to present a united front appealing to international observers and potential allies. Since 2017, HTS has dominated Idlib, the last major stronghold for various rebel groups after government forces retook Aleppo in December 2016. Over the years, HTS has solidified its control by functioning as a quasi-governmental entity, offering civil services and overseeing local affairs, such as highway control and commercial trucking duties, despite reports of human rights abuses. HTS’s propaganda has increasingly emphasized protecting Syrian territory and its people from Assad’s government, enhancing its standing among local communities and other rebel groups. To further improve its image, HTS has ramped up public relations efforts, both domestically and internationally. This includes engaging with international media and humanitarian organizations to negotiate and document aid deliveries, helping to position HTS as a defender of Sunni Muslim interests.

Israel Hits Former Syrian Army Sites in New Strikes	Israel carried out strikes on Monday targeting positions held by the ousted Syrian government's army in various locations, including Damascus, the south, and the coast, according to a war monitor. These strikes are part of a series of attacks that have occurred since rebels took control the day before. Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported that the Israeli strikes targeted military sites, including weapons depots containing anti-tank missiles and anti-aircraft weapons. He added that Israel is intentionally destroying anything it considers a threat. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar stated on Monday that Israel has attacked strategic weapons systems, including chemical weapons, long-range missiles, and rockets, to prevent them from falling into the hands of extremists.The post Israel Hits Former Syrian Army Sites in New Strikes first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-hits-former-syrian-army-sites-new-strikes/	2024-12-10T00:59:50-08:00	
Assad Fleeing to Moscow After Damascus Falls	After a surprise rebel advance in Syria, Bashar al-Assad fled to Moscow, receiving asylum from Russia, his long-time ally. The rebels’ rapid success in capturing Damascus marked the end of Assad's 50-year regime, which had been characterized by heavy control and repression. Thousands of Syrians celebrated in the streets, waving flags and firing guns, recalling the early days of the Arab Spring. The U.S. expressed support for the rebels, with President Biden noting that the shift in power had changed the Middle East balance. However, the situation remains uncertain, as the future of Syria and its region is still unclear. In the midst of these developments, Russia called for a U.N. Security Council meeting to discuss the unfolding events. Assad’s departure followed negotiations with rebel groups, where it was agreed that power would be peacefully transferred. The rebel leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani, who commands Syria's largest insurgent group, has positioned himself as a key figure in the country's future. Despite past ties to al-Qaida, he has distanced himself from the group and advocates for a pluralistic Syria. The rebellion faces immense challenges, as the country remains divided, with Turkey-backed forces clashing with Kurdish groups and remnants of ISIS still active. Rebels have promised to respect all ethnic and religious groups, but concerns over possible reprisals remain. In Damascus, celebrations erupted, with people chanting anti-Assad slogans and looting government buildings. Internationally, Iran and Russia have distanced themselves from Assad as their support has waned. Iran has called for a peaceful resolution and a transition to a new government, with U.N. officials calling for an orderly political transition. Meanwhile, Israel has seized a buffer zone in the Golan Heights, citing security concerns as Syria’s military withdrew from positions there. The situation is fluid, with many countries, including Qatar and the U.N., seeking ways to ensure stability and a peaceful future for Syria amidst the chaos.The post Assad Fleeing to Moscow After Damascus Falls first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/assad-moscow-damascus-falls/	2024-12-09T06:14:48-08:00	
Israeli Strike in Bint Jbeil Kills 1, Injures 4 Troops	The Lebanese Army reported that one person was killed and four soldiers injured on Monday in an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon, where a fragile ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel has been in place since last month. According to the Army, Israeli forces targeted a car near the Saf al-Hawa/Bint Jbeil military checkpoint, resulting in the death of a civilian and light injuries to four soldiers. The National News Agency confirmed that enemy aircraft struck the vehicle on the Saf al-Hawa road near an army checkpoint. The Israeli military stated that on Sunday, it attacked Hezbollah militants at a weapons storage facility in southern Lebanon, accusing them of violating the ceasefire. The military claimed these militants had orchestrated and carried out attacks against Israeli forces and civilians in recent months, and that several Hezbollah fighters had been targeted in the past 24 hours. Israel had intensified its operations in southern Lebanon in late September, following a year of border skirmishes initiated by Hezbollah in support of Hamas after the Palestinian group's attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023. A ceasefire agreement took effect on November 27, and while it has mostly held, both sides have accused each other of violating the truce. As part of the ceasefire agreement, the Lebanese Army and UN peacekeepers are expected to take over security in southern Lebanon while Israeli forces withdraw over 60 days. Hezbollah is also supposed to move its forces north of the Litani River, approximately 30 kilometers from the border, and dismantle its military infrastructure in southern Lebanon. Israel has issued repeated warnings to Lebanese civilians, advising them to avoid border areas, with another warning issued on Monday. The previous Monday, Israeli airstrikes in southern Lebanon resulted in 11 deaths, according to Lebanon’s health ministry, following Hezbollah’s claim of its first attack on an Israeli position since the ceasefire began. The same day, a Lebanese soldier was injured in an Israeli strike in the eastern Hermel region. Lebanese Health Minister Firas Abiad reported on Wednesday that the death toll from the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah had reached 4,047, with most casualties occurring since the escalation in September, including 316 children. On Tuesday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz warned that if the war resumes, Israel would act with greater force and penetrate deeper into Lebanon, stating that no immunity would be granted to the Lebanese state, which has not been directly involved in the conflict.The post Israeli Strike in Bint Jbeil Kills 1, Injures 4 Troops first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strike-bint-jbeil-kills-1-injures-4-troops/	2024-12-09T06:14:34-08:00	
Syria PM: Government Stands Amid Growing Challenges	Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali, who remained in office following the sudden disappearance of President Bashar al-Assad and many senior officials, is working to guide Syria through a transitional phase. He emphasized efforts to ensure the transition is swift and smooth, noting improvements in security and the formation of a new government. Jalali also confirmed that his administration is in communication with rebel factions and expressed his willingness to meet with opposition leaders, such as Ahmad al-Sharaa, a prominent rebel figure. Syria’s transition has seen bureaucrats and officials previously loyal to the Assad regime quickly adapting to the new political climate. For instance, Judge Khitam Haddad from the Justice Ministry expressed readiness to return to work, aiming to contribute to the rebuilding of the country. Haddad emphasized the importance of justice and fairness in the new Syria. In the midst of this upheaval, there have been reports of a high-ranking Assad ally’s death. Major General Ali Mahmoud, a senior aide to Assad’s brother, Maher, was found dead in his office in Damascus. The exact cause of death remains unclear, with some speculating it may have been either a suicide or a targeted killing. The situation in Syria remains fluid, with many key figures of the Assad regime now either absent or facing significant challenges. Jalali’s comments reflect the precarious nature of the country’s future as the nation grapples with a new order following years of brutal civil war.The post Syria PM: Government Stands Amid Growing Challenges first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/syria-pm-government-stands-growing-challenges/	2024-12-09T06:14:23-08:00	
Israel Calls Syria Buffer Zone Takeover a ‘Temporary Step’	Israel recently deployed forces into the demilitarized buffer zone along its northern border with Syria, following significant shifts in the region. As Syrian rebels, including the group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, made rapid advances and seized areas from President Bashar al-Assad's regime, Israel's military intervened to secure the buffer zone near the Golan Heights. The Israeli military emphasized that this was a temporary measure to protect Israeli citizens and prevent armed groups from crossing into Israeli-controlled territories. Despite this action, Israel clarified that it is not involved in Syria's internal conflict.The post Israel Calls Syria Buffer Zone Takeover a ‘Temporary Step’ first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-calls-syria-buffer-zone-takeover-temporary-step/	2024-12-09T06:14:10-08:00	
Four Israeli Soldiers Killed in South Lebanon Tunnel Collapse	On December 9, 2024, four Israeli soldiers were tragically killed in a collapse while engaging in military operations in southern Lebanon. The soldiers, who were reservists, were involved in a conflict with Hezbollah militants in the region. The incident occurred amidst ongoing tensions and military actions between Israel and Hezbollah forces, who are active in southern Lebanon and have been involved in numerous skirmishes since the outbreak of the latest hostilities. The collapse reportedly took place within a tunnel system that Israeli forces were targeting during their mission to dismantle Hezbollah's infrastructure. The soldiers were among several IDF personnel participating in the operation, which aimed to counter Hezbollah's activities along Israel's northern border. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed the deaths, which have raised concerns about the escalating conflict in southern Lebanon. This tragic event highlights the dangers faced by soldiers engaged in complex operations in hostile territories, particularly in regions with entrenched military infrastructure like tunnels used by Hezbollah.

Geagea Rejects Hezbollah Arms, Threatens Political Overhaul	Samir Geagea, leader of the Lebanese Forces, expressed his congratulations to the Lebanese people following the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria. He emphasized that for the past five decades, the Assad family rule had been the primary obstacle to establishing a stable state in Lebanon. Geagea noted that no matter what comes next in Syria, it would not be worse than the current regime under Bashar al-Assad. In a recent interview, Geagea stressed that Lebanon's government must take immediate action to fulfill its commitments, including implementing the ceasefire agreement that was reached on November 27, 2024. He also called for the parliament to carry out its duties effectively. Regarding the potential threat from Syrian rebel groups, Geagea asserted that Lebanon's state institutions must act to protect the country, asserting that the Lebanese Army is more than capable of defending its borders against any such threats. He dismissed the idea of Syrian groups launching an attack on Lebanon, pointing out that no such intention had been expressed. When asked whom he would reach out to in light of Assad's fall, Geagea mentioned Hezbollah’s deputy leader, Sheikh Naim Qassem. He suggested that the time had come for all Lebanese factions to prioritize the establishment of a functional state. Geagea stressed that Lebanon must not revert to its previous conditions and urged Hezbollah to disarm and work toward building a proper state. Geagea made it clear that if Hezbollah refused to cooperate, the government must enforce the ceasefire agreement. He warned that failure to do so would lead to a reevaluation of the situation, as the current state of affairs is unsustainable. The LF leader emphasized that Lebanon cannot continue to function as it has, with people leaving the country due to a party’s refusal to relinquish its weapons.The post Geagea Rejects Hezbollah Arms, Threatens Political Overhaul first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/geagea-rejects-hezbollah-arms-threatens-political-overhaul/	2024-12-09T06:13:44-08:00	
Russia Claims Assad Leaves Syria, Orders Peaceful Power Transfer	Russia's Foreign Ministry announced on Sunday that Bashar al-Assad had left Syria following discussions with rebel groups, and had issued instructions for a peaceful transfer of power. The ministry posted the statement on Telegram, clarifying that Moscow was not directly involved in the negotiations but had been closely monitoring the situation with significant concern. Since 2015, Russia has been involved militarily in Syria, partnering with Iran to support Assad’s government against opposition forces, helping it regain control of much of the country. However, with its primary military focus now on the conflict in Ukraine, Russia has reduced its active operations in Syria while maintaining a presence through its military bases and troops stationed there.The post Russia Claims Assad Leaves Syria, Orders Peaceful Power Transfer first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/russia-assad-leaves-syria-peaceful-transfer/	2024-12-08T10:08:02-08:00	
Nations Call for Stability as Rebels Oust Assad	Islamist-led rebels have successfully overthrown Syria’s long-standing leader, Bashar al-Assad, in a rapid offensive. The event has been described as a pivotal moment in Syria's civil war by the United Nations' special envoy. Here are global reactions to the situation: China expressed its hope that Syria could quickly return to stability, closely monitoring the ongoing developments in the country. Similarly, France welcomed Assad’s ousting, urging Syrians to reject extremism and push for unity amidst the nation's fragmentation, calling for a peaceful transition. Germany’s Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock stressed the importance of preventing Syria from falling into the hands of radicals, emphasizing the need to protect ethnic and religious minorities, such as Kurds and Alawites. In Iran, diplomats from Assad’s ally were reported to have evacuated the Syrian embassy in Damascus after it came under attack. Iran’s foreign minister had previously called for political dialogue between the Syrian government and opposition groups. Turkey's Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan acknowledged that the downfall of Assad was the culmination of Syria's prolonged civil war, which had plunged the country into turmoil over the past 13 years. A senior official from the United Arab Emirates urged Syrians to cooperate and prevent further chaos in the country. The United Kingdom echoed the sentiment of seeking stability through political solutions, despite acknowledging the brutal rule of Assad. The United Nations, cautiously optimistic, referred to the situation as a moment of hope for peace and reconciliation. Meanwhile, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump attributed Assad’s fall to Russia’s lack of interest in continuing its support for the Syrian regime. This shift marks a significant development in the ongoing conflict, with calls for both international cooperation and internal unity to chart a path forward for Syria.The post Nations Call for Stability as Rebels Oust Assad first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/nations-call-stability-rebels-oust-assad/	2024-12-08T10:07:52-08:00	
Israel Hits Syrian Arms Depots Near Damascus	In recent developments, Israel has reportedly targeted multiple Syrian arms depots near Damascus, focusing on sites that could potentially serve hostile forces in the region. These airstrikes, attributed to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), are part of Israel's ongoing efforts to neutralize military threats from Syria, particularly as the country grapples with instability amidst the collapse of Assad’s regime. The IDF has long been concerned about the growing presence of Iranian-backed forces and Hezbollah in Syria, which pose a strategic threat, particularly near Israel's northern border. The targeted strikes are believed to have struck weapons depots containing missile systems and potentially chemical weapons. Israeli authorities have been increasingly active in striking such facilities to limit the supply of advanced weaponry to groups hostile to Israel, such as Hezbollah. This military action coincides with reports of significant unrest within Syria, as various rebel factions make significant territorial gains, including areas close to Damascus. The escalating conflict has prompted Israeli officials to bolster their defense along the Golan Heights, while also monitoring the situation in Syria closely to prevent further destabilization near its borders. Israel’s airstrikes are seen as a continuation of its policy of preventing the transfer of advanced weaponry to its adversaries. Despite Syria’s claims of intercepting some missiles, these actions underscore the complexity of the regional security dynamics, where Israeli concerns about a potential Iranian and Hezbollah foothold in Syria remain a primary focus.The post Israel Hits Syrian Arms Depots Near Damascus first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-hits-syrian-arms-depots-near-damascus/	2024-12-08T10:07:42-08:00	
Netanyahu Orders Army to Seize Syria Buffer Zone	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently ordered the Israeli military to seize control of the buffer zone along the border with Syria, an area that had been under the protection of UN peacekeepers for decades. This action follows significant shifts in Syria's political landscape, including the weakening of President Bashar al-Assad's regime and the increasing instability in the region. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have begun bolstering defenses and constructing infrastructure along the border, including the creation of new roads and a buffer zone similar to the one already established along the Gaza frontier. Satellite imagery has revealed Israeli military personnel entering the so-called Alpha Line, a demilitarized zone that separates the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights from Syrian territory. These actions are seen as a response to the growing uncertainty surrounding Syria's future, particularly as rebel forces and Islamist groups gain ground and Assad's control weakens. The move is part of Israel's broader strategy to secure its northern border and prepare for potential post-Assad scenarios in Syria. While there has been no significant violence reported in the region yet, the presence of Israeli troops in the demilitarized zone represents a violation of the ceasefire agreements that have been in place since 1974. This escalation could increase tensions, as Syria, despite its silence on the matter, has historically opposed Israeli occupation and military actions in this area. Israel's decision to strengthen its hold on the Golan Heights region reflects the broader geopolitical changes in Syria, with the IDF anticipating further instability in the wake of Assad’s declining power. This strategic move aligns with Israel's long-term security interests, especially given the presence of Iranian-backed forces and Hezbollah near its northern border.The post Netanyahu Orders Army to Seize Syria Buffer Zone first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/netanyahu-army-seize-syria-buffer-zone/	2024-12-08T10:07:32-08:00
