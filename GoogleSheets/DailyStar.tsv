Jumblat Warns of ‘Open War’ Between Iran and Israel in Lebanon	Druze leader and former Progressive Socialist Party head Walid Jumblat has voiced a grim outlook on the ongoing conflict between Israel and Lebanon, expressing doubts about any quick resolution to the 'open war between Iran and Israel in Lebanon.' In an interview with al-Akhbar newspaper, Jumblat dismissed rumors about peace negotiations, saying he has not seen any credible signs of an impending end to the fighting. 'There are rumors, but I have no information suggesting the war will conclude soon,' he stated. Jumblat noted that it is unclear who to approach within Hezbollah, especially after the escalation following Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's assassination. 'In my view, it would be more effective to speak directly with the Islamic Republic of Iran,' he said, revealing that he recently declined a meeting request from an Iranian official. 'I refused because, as long as Iran treats Lebanon as a ground for proxy wars against the U.S. and Israel, I'm not interested,' he explained, referring to Lebanon’s long history as a site of regional conflicts. Regarding Lebanon’s options aside from 'resistance' against Israeli threats, Jumblat emphasized the importance of respecting Lebanese sovereignty. He acknowledged that many Lebanese, possibly half the population, support reinforcing U.N. resolutions in the south and deploying the Lebanese army there instead of allowing Lebanon to remain a battleground. When asked about Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea’s suggestion of electing a president without Shiite MPs in parliament, Jumblat voiced his opposition. He stressed that this issue is a fundamental matter tied to the National Pact, rather than merely numbers. 'No group or sect should be sidelined,' he concluded.The post Jumblat Warns of ‘Open War’ Between Iran and Israel in Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/jumblat-warns-war-iran-israel-lebanon/	2024-11-12T04:15:11-08:00	
Berri Declares Lebanon Won’t Accept Israel’s Solution at Its Expe...	Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri emphasized Lebanon's position on the current conflict, stating it clearly calls for a ceasefire and adherence to Resolution 1701. 'Could anyone reasonably believe we would agree to a resolution that serves Israel's interests at the expense of Lebanon's sovereignty?' Berri questioned in an interview with al-Joumhouria newspaper. He concluded by affirming, 'Ultimately, it will be the outcome on the battlefield that will determine the final say.'The post Berri Declares Lebanon Won’t Accept Israel’s Solution at Its Expense first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/berri-lebanon-wont-accept-israels-solution-expense/	2024-11-12T03:40:37-08:00	
Israeli Strikes Kill 14 in Gaza	According to Palestinian medical officials, at least 14 people, including two children and a woman, were killed in two Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, mostly within a designated humanitarian zone. The first strike, on Monday night, targeted a makeshift cafeteria in Muwasi, an area where displaced people have been taking refuge. This strike reportedly killed 11 people, including two children, with footage from the scene showing people being pulled from the wreckage of tables and chairs in a metal-enclosed area. This incident happened shortly after Israel announced it would expand the zone where displaced Palestinians are advised to seek safety. Currently, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians are staying in temporary camps around Muwasi, an area with limited facilities on Gaza's southern Mediterranean coast. Israel is under pressure from the Biden administration to increase aid access into Gaza or face potential limits on U.S. military support. While Israel has taken some steps, a report from eight international aid organizations on Tuesday stated that these efforts have fallen short of U.S. expectations. Early Tuesday, another strike targeted a house in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, killing three people, including a woman, and injuring 11 others, according to al-Awda Hospital. The Israeli military has not commented on either incident. Since Israel began its 13-month campaign in Gaza, over 43,000 Palestinians have been killed, as reported by local health officials who include both civilians and militants in their count, with more than half of the deaths reported to be women and children. Israel maintains that it targets Hamas operatives, attributing civilian casualties to the group’s operations within populated areas.The post Israeli Strikes Kill 14 in Gaza first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strikes-kill-14-gaza/	2024-11-12T03:40:26-08:00	
Israeli Minister Seeks West Bank Annexation, Courting Trump’s Sup...	Israel’s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has directed preparations for annexing West Bank settlements. On Monday, Smotrich, who oversees these settlements, announced he had ordered his department to 'prepare the infrastructure for applying sovereignty' in these areas. However, it remains uncertain whether this move to extend Israeli law over West Bank settlements will happen soon, as the Prime Minister’s Office has not yet responded. Earlier that day, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar stated that no formal decision on annexation had been made but recalled similar discussions during Donald Trump’s first term as U.S. president, suggesting the issue could be revisited with Washington if relevant. The Palestinian Authority quickly condemned Smotrich’s statement, with its foreign ministry calling it 'a blatantly colonial and racist extension' of displacement and violence against Palestinians. Nabil Abu Rudeineh, spokesperson for the Palestinian presidency, accused Israel of aiming to control the West Bank entirely by 2025 and held both Israel and the U.S. responsible for ongoing violence. Smotrich told the Knesset that Trump's election offers an 'important opportunity' for Israel, arguing that extending Israeli sovereignty in the West Bank is the 'only way to eliminate the threat of a Palestinian state.' Since Israel captured the West Bank in 1967, it has expanded settlements, housing around half a million Israelis there, although international law deems these settlements illegal. He further said he aims to lead a government decision that would seek international support, particularly from the U.S., to extend sovereignty in the area. During Trump’s first term, he recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and supported Israel's claim to the Golan Heights, both significant shifts in U.S. policy. Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad responded to Smotrich’s remarks, asserting they reveal Israel’s 'colonial intentions' and denying the feasibility of peace. Meanwhile, ongoing violence in Gaza and the West Bank has led to high casualties, with tens of thousands killed or displaced in Gaza and escalating violence in the West Bank, including settler attacks. On Monday, Foreign Minister Sa’ar mentioned that Israel may end its Gaza operations once its objectives are met, and he reiterated opposition to a separate Palestinian state. At the same time, the Arab League and Organization of Islamic Cooperation, in a summit in Riyadh, condemned Israeli actions in the West Bank and called for international intervention to halt the expansion of settlements, which they argue undermines prospects for a two-state solution.The post Israeli Minister Seeks West Bank Annexation, Courting Trump’s Support first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-minister-west-bank-annexation-courting-trumps-support/	2024-11-12T03:39:45-08:00	
Netanyahu Confirms Pager Attack, Aligns with Trump on Iran	Israel has, for the first time, confirmed its involvement in a September operation that detonated hundreds of pagers used by Hezbollah in Lebanon. On Sunday, Israeli media reported Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu informing his cabinet about the mission, known as the 'beeper operation,' which targeted Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah despite opposition from some senior security officials. An Israeli official later confirmed Netanyahu’s remarks to CNN, marking the first acknowledgment of Israel’s role in the incident. The decision to brief Israeli media on Netanyahu’s comments—thereby confirming Israel's involvement—appears to add another layer to the political tensions within Israel. Media coverage interpreted Netanyahu’s statement as indirect criticism of Israel’s military and intelligence leadership, including former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who was dismissed earlier that week. Israel’s government currently faces multiple criminal investigations, including alleged leaks of falsified intelligence to international media. The Prime Minister’s Office denies any wrongdoing. On September 17, multiple explosions targeted Hezbollah members in Lebanon, affecting both their pagers and walkie-talkies the following day. According to Lebanese health authorities, at least 37 people, including children, were killed, and nearly 3,000, many of them civilians, were injured in the blasts. On September 18, Gallant, while visiting an air force base, seemed to hint at Israel’s involvement, praising the 'excellent achievements' of the Israeli Defense Forces, Shin Bet, and Mossad. The timing of this acknowledgment coincides with Netanyahu’s recent discussions with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Ahead of a cabinet meeting on Sunday, Netanyahu noted three recent conversations with Trump, describing them as 'very good and very important' for solidifying the alliance between Israel and the United States. Netanyahu highlighted shared views on the threat from Iran and anticipated opportunities for Israel, including peace efforts and expansion in other areas. Netanyahu also addressed a recent incident in the Netherlands, where Israeli soccer fans faced antisemitic abuse and violence. He asserted that Israel would resist both antisemitism and terrorism, drawing a connection between recent antisemitic attacks against Israelis in the Netherlands and a case at the International Criminal Court (ICC), where arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant were sought on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. He affirmed Israel’s commitment to defending its citizens and interests, particularly against the threat posed by Iran. In response to recent attacks in Amsterdam, Israel issued a warning to its citizens, advising them to avoid attending international events involving Israelis. Israel’s National Security Council (NSC) warned of potential threats targeting Israelis and Jews at public gatherings, including sporting and cultural events, particularly in Belgium, the United Kingdom, and France. The advisory specifically urged Israelis to avoid the upcoming France-Israel soccer match in Paris and advised extra caution regarding visible Israeli or Jewish symbols in public settings.The post Netanyahu Confirms Pager Attack, Aligns with Trump on Iran first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/netanyahu-confirms-pager-attack-aligns-trump-iran/	2024-11-12T03:39:31-08:00	
UN Reports: 70% of Gaza Deaths Are Women and Children	Several United Nations agencies have again issued urgent warnings about the worsening humanitarian crisis in much of Gaza, emphasizing the civilian toll after more than a year of Israeli military actions. In a recent report assessing the fatalities over the first six months of the conflict, the UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR) noted that nearly 70% of those killed were children and women, which they interpret as a 'systematic violation of fundamental principles of international humanitarian law' by the Israeli military. The report highlights that ongoing attacks reflect 'apparent indifference' to civilian casualties and the impact of the methods used in these strikes. The findings show that 80% of verified deaths occurred in residential buildings, with 44% of those killed being children and 26% women. OHCHR identified a recurring pattern of entire families, including babies, older people, and young children, losing their lives in residential settings. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, stated that these civilian casualties were directly linked to failures in upholding essential principles of international humanitarian law, including distinction, proportionality, and precaution in attacks. He stressed that this pattern of harm to civilians remains 'unabated' over a year into the conflict. The UN children's agency, UNICEF, reported that in October alone, at least 64 attacks targeted schools in Gaza, killing an estimated 128 people, many of whom were children. Nearly half of these incidents occurred in northern Gaza, an area facing intense bombardment, mass displacement, and inadequate aid. According to UNICEF, over 95% of Gaza’s schools have been partially or fully destroyed since the conflict began. Israel has previously claimed that Hamas utilizes schools and other civilian areas for its operations. Additionally, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported an impending risk of famine in parts of northern Gaza, where recent Israeli operations are concentrated. Their findings show a rapid rise in hunger, malnutrition, and mortality due to lack of food and disease, warning that famine thresholds may already be reached or close to being met. According to WHO data, aid shipments into Gaza have dropped significantly, with an average of just 58 trucks entering daily in late October—down from around 500 trucks daily before the conflict began. Food prices have also skyrocketed by 312% since the start of the conflict. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus expressed deep concern, calling for immediate and secure access to increase humanitarian aid, particularly food and medicine for severe malnutrition, emphasizing the need for assistance 'within days, not weeks.' In response, the Israeli agency overseeing aid transfers to Gaza, COGAT, dismissed the famine warnings, claiming past reports have often relied on sources with vested interests or limited accuracy. COGAT also stated that Israel's military has repeatedly urged northern Gaza residents to move to safer zones, noting a significant humanitarian effort underway in central and southern Gaza. The agency reported that over the past two months, more than 39,000 trucks carrying over 840,000 tons of food have been allowed into Gaza.The post UN Reports: 70% of Gaza Deaths Are Women and Children first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/un-70-of-gaza-deaths-women-children/	2024-11-12T03:39:19-08:00	
Qatar Suspends Mediation Role in Israel-Hamas Talks	Qatar has announced it will halt its mediation role between Israel and Hamas, citing a lack of genuine commitment from both sides to negotiate. Qatar has been a key mediator in indirect discussions between the two parties, alongside Egypt, and has hosted Hamas’ political office in Doha since 2012. According to a diplomatic source, Qatar made this decision after both Israel and Hamas reportedly failed to engage constructively. Ten days prior, Qatar had warned both sides that it would step back from its role if they could not reach an agreement in the latest negotiation attempt, said Majed Al-Ansari, Qatar's foreign ministry spokesperson. Negotiations between Israel and Hamas have largely stalled, except for a brief ceasefire last November, during which Hamas released 105 hostages and Israel freed 240 Palestinian prisoners. Recent mediation efforts, however, have reportedly shifted from genuine diplomacy to political maneuvering, according to a source. With negotiations faltering, Hamas’ political office in Doha may close, and its operations could pause unless talks resume. Hamas maintains that any deal with Israel must include a permanent end to the conflict in Gaza, a demand that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected, especially after altering terms of a potential agreement earlier this year. Currently, 101 hostages remain in Gaza as Israel’s ongoing military operations have, according to Palestinian health officials, led to over 43,000 Palestinian casualties, with the UN noting that a significant proportion of early fatalities were women and children. Reacting to Qatar’s decision, Israeli Economy Minister Nir Barkat criticized Qatar, claiming it has always supported Hamas, while Qatari officials have countered that their efforts have sometimes been misrepresented to serve narrow political interests. Qatar has since informed the Biden administration of its willingness to resume mediation if both sides reach an impasse and genuinely wish to restart peace talks. A U.S. official noted that while Qatar’s mediation efforts had been significant in past hostage negotiations, Hamas’ refusal to release hostages has now rendered their presence in Doha untenable.The post Qatar Suspends Mediation Role in Israel-Hamas Talks first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/qatar-suspends-mediation-role-israel-hamas-talks/	2024-11-12T03:39:01-08:00	
Watch: Trump Appoints Tom Homan as ‘Border Czar’ to Oversee Depor...	US President-elect Donald Trump has appointed former acting ICE Director Tom Homan as the 'border czar' for his next administration. Known for supporting Trump’s strict 'zero tolerance' immigration policy, Homan will oversee all border-related matters, including the southern and northern borders, as well as maritime and aviation security. Announcing the decision on Truth Social, Trump praised Homan’s expertise, stating he would manage deportations and border security with precision. 'Tom Homan will be in charge of all deportations of illegal immigrants to their countries of origin. I know he’ll do an outstanding job,' Trump said. The term 'border czar' has been used by Trump and other Republicans to criticize Vice President Kamala Harris’s handling of migration from Central America. Trump’s initial plans as President-elect include stringent immigration measures, with Homan at the helm to ensure their implementation. Homan, in a previous role, pledged to lead a significant deportation force. In an October interview on 60 Minutes, he affirmed that deportations could be conducted without separating families, stating, 'Families can be deported together.' Speaking recently on Fox News, Homan clarified that military forces wouldn’t be involved in arrests. Instead, he emphasized that ICE would carry out deportations in an organized, humane way, saying, 'Our operations are targeted and well-planned, carried out by experienced ICE agents who know who and where they’re looking for.'The post Watch: Trump Appoints Tom Homan as ‘Border Czar’ to Oversee Deportations first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/trump-appoints-tom-homan-border-czar/	2024-11-11T06:33:19-08:00	
Saudi Crown Prince Calls for Immediate Gaza, Lebanon Ceasefire at...	Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman called for immediate ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon during a joint summit with the Arab League and Organization of Islamic Cooperation on Monday, where leaders renewed support for a Palestinian state. This summit, held in Riyadh over a year into the Israel-Hamas conflict and broader regional tensions, offered a platform to signal the region’s priorities to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Prince Mohammed opened the gathering by urging the global community to stop Israel’s actions in Gaza and Lebanon, calling Israel’s operations in Gaza 'genocide.' He affirmed Saudi Arabia's support for Palestinians and Lebanese in facing the humanitarian impact of these conflicts. A draft resolution for the summit highlights strong backing for Palestinian 'national rights,' with an emphasis on their right to freedom and a sovereign state. However, Israel’s new Foreign Minister Gideon Saar dismissed the idea of a Palestinian state as unrealistic, describing it as a potential 'Hamas state.' This summit follows a similar Riyadh meeting a year prior, where leaders condemned Israeli military actions in Gaza. The event also reflects the region's stance toward Trump’s impending administration, as Gulf analyst Anna Jacobs noted that it provides regional leaders an opportunity to advocate for U.S. engagement focused on dialogue and de-escalation, specifically opposing Israeli military actions. The Gaza conflict was ignited by Hamas’s attack on southern Israel on October 7 the previous year. Since then, Hezbollah in Lebanon, backed by Iran like Hamas, has also engaged Israel in cross-border attacks, which escalated when Israel intensified its operations in southern Lebanon in late September. During his previous term, Trump supported Israel robustly, recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, endorsing West Bank settlements, and facilitating the Abraham Accords, which established diplomatic ties between Israel, the UAE, Bahrain, and Morocco. Saudi Arabia has yet to join these accords, holding that any formal recognition of Israel must be contingent upon establishing a Palestinian state. While the summit brought together the OIC’s 57 members and the Arab League’s 22 countries, including those with and without formal relations with Israel, differences remain on measures such as economic or diplomatic actions against Israel.The post Saudi Crown Prince Calls for Immediate Gaza, Lebanon Ceasefire at Arab Summit first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/saudi-prince-calls-gaza-lebanon-ceasefire-arab-summit/	2024-11-11T05:53:39-08:00	
Al-Rahi Urges Hezbollah to Learn from Destructive War	Maronite Patriarch Beshara al-Rahi has urged Hezbollah to reflect on the ongoing war with Israel, describing its devastating impact on Lebanon. He emphasized that Hezbollah should consider the lessons from a conflict that has led to the displacement of 1.5 million Lebanese, claimed thousands of lives, and injured tens of thousands. Al-Rahi highlighted that while this destruction continues, Lebanon has repeatedly borne the costs of its conflict with Israel, met with relative silence from Arab and international communities. When asked about implementing U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 without enforcing Resolutions 1559 and 1680, al-Rahi noted that current discussions are centered solely on Resolution 1701. Regarding views that attribute Lebanon’s decline to 'political Shiism,' al-Rahi said that while political Shiism is not solely responsible, general corruption, recurring governmental failures, a prolonged presidential void, and poor management have all contributed significantly to Lebanon’s struggles.The post Al-Rahi Urges Hezbollah to Learn from Destructive War first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/al-rahi-urges-hezbollah-learn-destructive-war/	2024-11-11T05:53:26-08:00	
Harris and Trump Wrap Up Historic Campaigns with Final Voter Appe...	On the eve of Election Day, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump made their final pitches to voters, who will decide whether to elect the nation’s first female president or grant Trump a historic return to the White House. With polls indicating a close race, Trump promised a future of 'new heights of glory' while Harris asserted that momentum favored her campaign, as both candidates held rallies in critical swing states. Harris wrapped up her campaign in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania—a crucial state for victory—with a rally at the famed 'Rocky' steps. Emphasizing the importance of each vote in what she called 'one of the closest races in history,' Harris was joined by high-profile supporters like Lady Gaga and Oprah Winfrey. Drawing on the spirit of the movie, she acknowledged the determination of underdogs who fight their way to victory, a sentiment she embraces after joining the race just three months ago following President Biden's exit. Meanwhile, Trump held his final rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, accompanied by family members, though his wife Melania was notably absent. His speech in Michigan and earlier stops in North Carolina and Pennsylvania included ominous rhetoric, as he told supporters that their vote could solve the nation’s problems and uplift both America and the world. The election is set to be defined by voter turnout, as both campaigns focus on mobilizing supporters on Election Day. Over 82 million votes have already been cast in early voting, but both candidates stressed the need for a strong showing on the day itself. Trump urged his supporters to turn out in large numbers, while Harris called on Pennsylvanians specifically to make their voices heard. The race, which officially began at midnight in Dixville Notch, New Hampshire, with a tie of three votes each for Harris and Trump, has seen the candidates present starkly different messages. Trump painted a dire picture of a nation beset by crime and immigration issues, while Harris highlighted her stance against Trump’s abortion policies and called for a 'fresh start' beyond the Trump era. The stakes are high globally, as the election outcome will impact international conflicts, climate policy, and democracy itself, especially if Trump loses and repeats his refusal to accept defeat, as in 2020. The threat of violence looms, particularly after an assassination attempt against Trump in July and recent concerns over unrest. In Washington, D.C., many businesses are bracing for potential disturbances by boarding up in preparation.The post Harris and Trump Wrap Up Historic Campaigns with Final Voter Appeal first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/harris-trump-wrap-up-campaigns-final-appeal/	2024-11-05T03:11:21-08:00	
Israeli Airstrike Kills 20 in Northern Gaza	Palestinian medical authorities report that an Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza has killed at least 20 people, most of whom were women and children. According to Hossam Abu Safiya, director of a nearby hospital that treated the casualties, the strike hit a residence in Beit Lahiya where multiple families were taking shelter late on Monday. The Gaza Health Ministry’s emergency services confirmed that among those killed were eight women and six children. The Israeli military has not yet commented on the incident. For nearly a month, Israel has been conducting a large-scale operation in northern Gaza, one of the most isolated and devastated areas of the region. Israeli authorities ordered the full evacuation of Beit Lahiya, nearby Beit Hanoun, and the densely populated Jabaliya refugee camp, allowing almost no humanitarian assistance into the area over this period. As the conflict continues, tens of thousands have fled to Gaza City, joining the growing numbers displaced since hostilities began following the October 7, 2023, attack by Hamas-led militants on southern Israel.The post Israeli Airstrike Kills 20 in Northern Gaza first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-airstrike-kills-20-northern-gaza/	2024-11-05T03:11:06-08:00	
Trump Calls for Election Night Winner, But Outcome Unlikely	Former President Donald Trump has increased his calls for a quick declaration of a presidential winner shortly after polls close on Tuesday, even though the complete vote count won’t be finished by then. Trump’s approach mirrors his 2020 declaration of victory in the early hours after Election Day, which led his allies to call for a halt to the counting process. Since then, Trump and many conservatives have consistently claimed, without evidence, that the 2020 election was stolen from him, criticizing the lengthy ballot-counting process in the U.S. One of the reasons results won’t be immediate is that some Republican lawmakers in key states haven’t changed laws that prevent early processing of mail-in ballots, which delays final tallies. Additionally, in a close race, it naturally takes more time to finalize who has won. As election experts point out, ensuring an accurate and secure count is far more important than rushing to announce a winner the night polls close. Trump’s demand also doesn’t consider the six time zones across the U.S., where votes on the West Coast are still being cast while polls close on the East Coast. David Becker, an election expert, notes that it’s unrealistic to expect officials across thousands of precincts to count ballots instantly, particularly with multiple-page ballots covering numerous races. On Sunday in Pennsylvania, Trump reiterated his demand, saying that the results should be known 'by 9 o’clock, 10 o’clock, 11 o’clock on Tuesday night.' His comments add to a narrative pushed by some conservatives that the U.S. should aim for the same swift results as countries like France and Argentina, which tally results quickly but only for a single election at a time. In contrast, the U.S. has nearly 10,000 jurisdictions counting various races simultaneously, contributing to the extended time frame. Declaring a winner takes time, especially in close races. The Associated Press and other networks call races when the margin is secure, but in tight contests, every vote matters, leading to longer wait times. In 2018, for instance, the AP held off calling Florida’s Senate race until after a recount, though it is typically a state known for its fast tallying. Complications also arise from the processing of provisional and overseas ballots, as well as checking mail ballots for legitimacy. Some states, like Arizona, allow voters time to correct mismatched signatures on mail ballots, delaying final numbers until several days after Election Day. In Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers have resisted calls to allow pre-Election Day processing of mail ballots, creating a delay in reporting. This has led to the 'red mirage' or 'blue shift' effect, where early leads for Republicans are offset later by Democratic mail-in votes. Trump took advantage of this in 2020 by calling for vote counts to stop before these ballots were counted. This year, the trend may differ, with Republicans casting early votes in larger numbers. Michigan, which recently removed restrictions on early mail ballot processing, hopes to have results out sooner. Officials like Michigan’s Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson urge the public to rely on the statements of election officials, rather than candidate claims. Trump’s allies encourage him to declare victory as early as possible. Steve Bannon has argued that Trump should claim victory even before final results, echoing his stance from 2020. Former national security adviser Michael Flynn has warned of potential unrest if votes are still being counted the day after the election. The Trump campaign is working to project confidence in an early lead, highlighting favorable polls and Republican turnout in early voting. However, early voting data only shows who has voted, not how they voted, and this doesn’t necessarily indicate a win for Republicans. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign has targeted Republicans dissatisfied with Trump, and large numbers of voters in swing states who aren’t registered with either major party could shift the results. Only a complete count can reveal who actually won the election, so the public must wait until all votes are tallied.The post Trump Calls for Election Night Winner, But Outcome Unlikely first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/trump-calls-election-night-winner-but-outcome-unlikely/	2024-11-05T03:10:53-08:00	
Blinken Expresses Regret Over Hamas Rejection of New Truce Propos...	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has attributed Hamas' rejection of a short-term truce in Gaza to the group’s insistence on a permanent ceasefire instead. Following a proposal from Egypt and Qatar, which Hamas dismissed, Blinken emphasized that Hamas has again refused to release even a small number of hostages to facilitate a ceasefire and relief for Gaza’s residents, according to a State Department report. In a recent call with Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty, Blinken stressed the urgency of ending the conflict, freeing hostages, and ensuring a steady flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza. President Joe Biden had proposed a ceasefire plan on May 31, including a hostage release provision, though Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has maintained the need for Israeli troops along the Egyptian border. CIA Director Bill Burns has discussed potential progress in Qatar with his Mossad counterpart, including a temporary ceasefire aimed at releasing some hostages, as reported by a source familiar with the dialogue. Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin have advised that the U.S. may hold back certain arms to Israel unless it improves the flow of aid into Gaza. Additionally, Blinken encouraged Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant to continue increasing and maintaining essential humanitarian supplies, such as food and medicine, to Gaza’s civilian population. Meanwhile, Israel’s parliament recently decided to restrict its dealings with the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), despite Blinken’s direct appeal for cooperation. Blinken has also been actively pursuing a diplomatic solution in Lebanon that could enable both Lebanese and Israeli civilians to return home safely.The post Blinken Expresses Regret Over Hamas Rejection of New Truce Proposal first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/blinken-regret-hamas-rejection-new-truce-proposal/	2024-11-05T03:10:28-08:00	
Lebanese Red Cross Makes New Attempt to Recover Bodies from Strik...	The Lebanese Red Cross is set to send another convoy on Tuesday to Wata al-Khiam in southern Lebanon to recover the bodies of 15 individuals killed in an Israeli airstrike, according to Lebanon’s National News Agency (NNA). Two days earlier, paramedics accessed the strike site and removed five bodies but require larger vehicles to clear the remaining debris. The NNA reported that this mission is being coordinated with UNIFIL, the United Nations peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, as is standard procedure. While the Red Cross has not commented directly on the operation, it has voiced concerns recently about Israeli strikes near areas where they have been actively searching for casualties. The Israeli military stated it issued warnings in late October for residents to evacuate due to planned strikes on Hezbollah targets and advised ambulances to avoid the area.The post Lebanese Red Cross Makes New Attempt to Recover Bodies from Strike Site first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lebanese-red-cross-new-attempt-recover-bodies/	2024-11-05T03:10:09-08:00

Netanyahu Urges Pushing Hezbollah Beyond Litani to Restore Securi...	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged a strong response to Hezbollah's actions during a visit to the Lebanon border on Sunday, according to his office. He emphasized three key objectives for ensuring peace and security in the northern region. First, he stated the need to push Hezbollah back beyond the Litani River. Second, he vowed to prevent any attempts by the group to rearm. Lastly, he promised a firm reaction to any attacks directed at Israel. Netanyahu asserted that these actions are essential to restoring stability in the north and ensuring the safe return of residents to the area.The post Netanyahu Urges Pushing Hezbollah Beyond Litani to Restore Security first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/netanyahu-pushing-hezbollah-beyond-litani/	2024-11-04T03:33:07-08:00	
Breaking: Netanyahu Aide Arrested Amid Accusations of Leaking Int...	Israeli police recently detained a senior aide to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on suspicion of leaking classified information to foreign media outlets. Opposition leaders claim the intelligence involved was 'fabricated' to prevent a ceasefire and a hostage release deal in Gaza. The investigation revolves around claims that Netanyahu's office promoted a story to foreign media, alleging Hamas planned to move hostages across the Egyptian border, creating divisions within Israel to pressure Netanyahu into a ceasefire and hostage deal. Eliezer Feldstein, reportedly an aide to Netanyahu, is among those being questioned in connection with the unauthorized release of sensitive intelligence, which a court document suggests may have compromised efforts to rescue hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. A spokesperson for Netanyahu denied any leaks from the Prime Minister’s Office, stating that Feldstein had no involvement in security discussions. The office also dismissed claims that these leaks impacted negotiations with Hamas, calling them 'ridiculous.' Opposition leader Yair Lapid accused Netanyahu’s office of leaking 'fabricated' intelligence to sway public opinion and undermine potential hostage deals. The families of hostages in Gaza have voiced concerns that Netanyahu may be stalling a potential agreement, suspecting that an end to the conflict in Gaza could necessitate new elections. The alleged leaks were the basis for two articles published in September, one in the Jewish Chronicle in the UK and another in Germany’s Bild, both citing Israeli intelligence sources and backing a narrative Netanyahu had been advancing. As ceasefire discussions and hostage release negotiations unfolded, public protests intensified, with Israelis urging the government to finalize a deal with Hamas. Tensions escalated when six Israelis were killed in Gaza on September 1; four were reportedly set for release under a proposed deal. The next day, Netanyahu held a news conference, presenting a Hamas document allegedly found in a Gaza tunnel that suggested efforts to divide Israelis. He reiterated Israel’s need to control the Gaza-Egypt border, the Philadelphi corridor, to prevent hostages from being taken to Sinai and potentially to Iran or Yemen. A few days later, the Jewish Chronicle published an article claiming intelligence suggested that Hamas leaders planned to escape with hostages through the corridor. Although since removed, the article is still accessible through archives. Netanyahu’s son, Yair, shared the article on social media. Israeli officials, including IDF spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, publicly denied knowing details about the supposed plan to move hostages through the Philadelphi corridor. Around the same time, an article in Germany’s Bild cited an intelligence document purportedly showing how Hamas sought to prolong the conflict and pressure the Israeli public. The IDF later clarified that the document mentioned in Bild was neither authored by Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar nor recent, but rather an old document found five months prior. When the court lifted a gag order on Sunday, families of hostages pointed at the prime minister’s office, alleging it had orchestrated one of the 'biggest deceptions' in Israel’s history. Opposition leaders Yair Lapid and Benny Gantz, who had previously left Netanyahu’s wartime cabinet, criticized the government, with Gantz calling the incident a 'national crime.' Both attributed responsibility for the leak to Netanyahu’s office, and Lapid suggested the possibility that the leaks might have been deliberate to sabotage earlier hostage negotiations with Hamas. Lapid’s statement expressed suspicion that Netanyahu’s team might have circulated both real and falsified documents to hinder a potential hostage deal. He urged a thorough investigation to determine if these actions were taken under Netanyahu’s directive.The post Breaking: Netanyahu Aide Arrested Amid Accusations of Leaking Intelligence to Block Gaza Ceasefire first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/netanyahu-aide-leaking-intelligence-block-ceasefire/	2024-11-04T03:32:47-08:00	
Breaking: Israel Claims Top Hezbollah Commander Killed in Lebanon...	The Israeli military reported on Monday that it had killed a senior Hezbollah commander, identified as Abu Ali Rida, in an airstrike. Rida, who oversaw Hezbollah operations in the Baraashit area of southern Lebanon, was said to be in charge of coordinating and carrying out rocket and anti-tank missile attacks targeting Israeli forces in the region. According to the military, he directed the actions of Hezbollah fighters in the area. Since conflict erupted in late September, Israel has continued to target Hezbollah positions in Lebanon, leading to the deaths of several key Hezbollah commanders and leaders, including former chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. The ongoing hostilities began after nearly a year of cross-border incidents, during which Hezbollah frequently launched rockets into northern Israel in support of Hamas, its ally in Gaza. Israel is also engaged in its most intense conflict with Hamas in Gaza following an attack by the Palestinian militant group on southern Israel on October 7 of the previous year.The post Breaking: Israel Claims Top Hezbollah Commander Killed in Lebanon Strike first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-top-hezbollah-commander-killed-lebanon/	2024-11-04T03:31:03-08:00

Iranian President Warns Ceasefire in Lebanon or Gaza May Impact R...	Iran’s president has stated that a possible ceasefire involving Iran’s allies and Israel might influence how Tehran responds to recent Israeli airstrikes on Iranian military sites. He noted that if Israel halts its attacks and agrees to a ceasefire, Iran’s response might vary in intensity. According to Iran’s state news agency IRNA, President Masoud Pezeshkian reiterated that Iran would not ignore any attack against its sovereignty or security. Israel's strikes on October 26 were framed as a reaction to Iran’s missile attacks on October 1, which Iran had described as retaliation for the deaths of several Iran-backed leaders and a Revolutionary Guards commander. Since these escalations, Israel has warned against any Iranian retaliation, while Iran has promised a response. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, also affirmed that Iran would respond strongly, mentioning that both the United States and Israel should expect a forceful reply. Khamenei’s remarks referenced Iran’s regional allies, such as Yemen’s Houthis, Lebanon’s Hezbollah, and Hamas. Following the October strikes, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the attacks targeted Iran's defensive and missile production capabilities. According to Iran's armed forces, the strikes resulted in the deaths of four military personnel and some damage to radar systems, with Iranian media reporting an additional civilian casualty.The post Iranian President Warns Ceasefire in Lebanon or Gaza May Impact Response to Israel first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/iranian-president-ceasefire-lebanon-impact-israel/	2024-11-04T03:30:34-08:00	
Iran Condemns US B-52 Deployment as ‘Destabilizing’	Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei criticized the United States on Monday, calling its recent deployment of B-52 bombers in the region a 'destabilizing presence.' Baghaei stated that Iran has always viewed the American presence in the region as destabilizing and asserted that it would not weaken Iran's determination to protect itself. The US military announced on Saturday that it had deployed B-52 bombers to the Middle East in response to Iran's vow to retaliate against Israeli strikes on Iranian military sites on October 26. Those strikes by Israel were in response to an October 1 missile attack from Iran, which Iran carried out in retaliation for the deaths of Iran-backed militant leaders and a Revolutionary Guards commander. These attacks reportedly led to the deaths of at least four Iranian soldiers and caused minor damage to radar systems, with one civilian also reported killed by Iranian media. Baghaei stated that Iran’s response to the strikes would be firm and assured. He also expressed Iran’s support for initiatives aimed at achieving a ceasefire in both Gaza and Lebanon, where Iran-backed groups Hamas and Hezbollah are engaged in conflict with Israel. Israel claimed its October 26 strikes aimed to target Iran's defense and missile production capabilities, although Iranian officials stated that missile production was unaffected. Additionally, President Masoud Pezeshkian remarked that Iran's missile capabilities act as a deterrent against potential attacks from Israel. Addressing Iran's stance on nuclear policy, Baghaei reaffirmed that the country’s official position against nuclear weapons remains unchanged. Referring to recent statements by Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, he emphasized that Iran would be fully equipped to defend itself if necessary.The post Iran Condemns US B-52 Deployment as ‘Destabilizing’ first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/iran-condemns-us-b-52-deployment-destabilizing/	2024-11-04T03:30:18-08:00	
Thousands Displaced in East Lebanon as Israeli Strikes Intensify	In the Christian town of Deir al-Ahmar, Hassan Noun has set up a tent in a church courtyard, seeking refuge after escaping Israeli airstrikes in Baalbek, eastern Lebanon. 'We need proper shelter,' he said, expressing concern over the approaching winter, 'the children need a place safe from the rain and snow.' Noun and his family are among around 30,000 others displaced to Deir al-Ahmar, one of the few Christian areas untouched by Israeli bombings targeting Hezbollah strongholds in mainly Shiite Muslim regions. 'Churches and schools are crowded with people, unable to hold any more,' he added, with his family's belongings— a teapot and kitchen items—arranged on a bench, and foam mattresses and laundry scattered around the church grounds. Seventeen-year-old Fatima also fled her home in Chaath due to the ongoing bombardments. Her family now stays in a makeshift shelter at a school in Bechouat, near Deir al-Ahmar, using desks and blankets to create some privacy. 'There’s no heating, and we lack warm clothes,' she said, lamenting the disruption to her studies. Randa Amhaz, another displaced resident, expressed gratitude to the school for providing shelter but stressed the need for warm clothing for children and medication for the elderly. Since September 23, Israeli airstrikes have killed over 1,900 people in Lebanon, based on data from Lebanon's health ministry. The Baalbek-Hermel region alone reported 52 deaths on Friday due to intensified strikes, displacing more than 78,000 people, according to the International Organization for Migration. Deir al-Ahmar initially received 12,000 displaced people who found shelter in homes, church facilities, and some open spaces. But as Israeli attacks escalated this week, another 20,000 arrived, many sleeping in public spaces, said Rabih Saade from the local emergency committee. He called on authorities for ongoing support, uncertain of how long the crisis will last. In a schoolyard, women and children gathered in the sun, and a woman seated beside her elderly mother shared her anxiety, saying, 'We left our homes with no clear plan, no idea where to turn.' With limited room, she sleeps on a foam mattress in a narrow passageway between two doors.The post Thousands Displaced in East Lebanon as Israeli Strikes Intensify first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/thousands-displaced-east-lebanon-israeli-strikes-intensify/	2024-11-03T01:55:33-08:00	
UN Reports Israel Struck ‘Humanitarian Structures’ on Lebanon-Syr...	U.N. refugee chief Filippo Grandi reported that an Israeli airstrike targeted 'humanitarian structures' on Saturday at a border crossing between Lebanon and Syria. The crossing, known as Jousieh in Syria, has been an essential route for those escaping the Israel-Hezbollah conflict since the primary crossing was hit last month. Late in October, a prior Israeli strike created a large crater at Jousieh, blocking it for vehicle traffic and disrupting movement. Grandi announced on social media platform X that another Israeli airstrike struck the Jousieh border post, where many Lebanese and Syrians cross. He added that the targeting of humanitarian facilities further complicates efforts to help those fleeing, making escape increasingly risky as the conflict expands. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, based in Britain, two Israeli strikes impacted Jousieh on Saturday. This recent attack follows an Israeli airstrike on October 4 that shut down the main Masnaa crossing between Beirut and Damascus. Lebanon and Syria share six official crossings along their border, though numerous unofficial routes exist due to the porous terrain. Israel has accused Hezbollah of using these routes to transport weapons into Lebanon from Syria.The post UN Reports Israel Struck ‘Humanitarian Structures’ on Lebanon-Syria Border first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-struck-humanitarian-structures-lebanon-syria-border/	2024-11-03T01:55:12-08:00	
Mikati Demands UN Action on Batroun Abduction	Israeli naval commandos detained a trainee mariner, identified by an Israeli military official as a 'senior operative' of Hezbollah, during a raid in Lebanon, bringing him to Israel for questioning. In response, Lebanon’s Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati instructed the foreign ministry to file a complaint with the U.N. Security Council over the raid in Batroun, a coastal town south of Tripoli. Both the Lebanese Army and U.N. peacekeeping force UNIFIL have launched investigations into the incident, with Mikati urging prompt findings. The operation, initially reported by Lebanese sources and later confirmed by an Israeli military official, marks the first such raid since the onset of the Israel-Hezbollah conflict in September. According to the Israeli military, the detained individual, described as a Hezbollah expert, is now undergoing investigation in Israel. Lebanon's National News Agency reported that an 'unidentified military force' conducted a pre-dawn 'sea landing' on Friday in Batroun, advancing with full equipment to a chalet near the beach where they captured a Lebanese man before leaving by speedboat. A person familiar with the detainee identified him as a student at the Maritime Sciences and Technology Institute (MARSATI), Lebanon’s leading training college for maritime professions. Though residing in Batroun for his studies, he is originally from the Shiite-majority town of Qmatiyeh. According to the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to security concerns, the man is in his 30s and well-regarded by the institute’s staff. The Christian-majority town of Batroun has remained largely unaffected by the Israel-Hezbollah conflict, which has heavily impacted south Lebanon, Beirut’s southern suburbs, and the Bekaa Valley. Since hostilities began on September 23, over 1,900 people have died in Lebanon, as recorded by Lebanon’s health ministry, though the actual number is expected to be higher. Israel has reported 38 military casualties in Lebanon since ground operations commenced on September 30.The post Mikati Demands UN Action on Batroun Abduction first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/mikati-demands-un-action-batroun-abduction/	2024-11-03T01:54:46-08:00	
Bangladeshi National Killed in Israeli Strike on Lebanon	A Bangladeshi worker was killed in an airstrike in Lebanon, Bangladesh's foreign ministry reported on Sunday, as efforts to evacuate citizens from the conflict zone are hindered by ongoing Israeli bombardments. According to the ministry, around 70,000 to 100,000 Bangladeshi nationals are employed in Lebanon, mostly as laborers or domestic workers. In coordination with the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration, Dhaka's government organized initial flights last month to bring some Bangladeshis home from Beirut. The deceased, Mohammad Nizam, 31, was reportedly killed in an airstrike on Saturday afternoon while stopping at a coffee shop on his way to work in Beirut, as confirmed by Bangladesh’s ambassador to Lebanon, Javed Tanveer Khan. Nizam, who had lived in Beirut for over a decade, was not among the roughly 1,800 Bangladeshis registered for repatriation flights. Nizam’s older brother, Mohammad Jalaluddin, expressed his family’s wish to bring Nizam's body back to Bangladesh for burial at their ancestral home, pending government assistance. Shah Mohammad Tanvir Monsur, a senior official in Bangladesh’s foreign ministry, noted the increasing difficulty in arranging flights from Beirut, given the current hostilities. 'The ongoing war has made it challenging to facilitate flights from Lebanon to Bangladesh,' Monsur explained, adding that evacuating registered citizens has become increasingly complicated. Since September, Israel has intensified airstrikes against Hezbollah in Lebanon, resulting in mass displacement and the launch of a ground offensive aimed at pushing Hezbollah forces back from the Israeli border. Over the past year, Hezbollah has fired thousands of projectiles into Israel, displacing tens of thousands of Israelis. Since the conflict's escalation on September 23, an estimated 1,930 people have been killed in Lebanon, based on health ministry figures. Israel reports 38 soldiers killed since it began ground operations on September 30. However, actual figures on both sides are likely higher due to incomplete data.The post Bangladeshi National Killed in Israeli Strike on Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/bangladeshi-national-killed-israeli-strike-lebanon/	2024-11-03T01:54:20-08:00

Breaking: Israeli Forces Land on Batroun Shore, Capture ‘Hezbolla...	Israeli Forces Land on Batroun Shore, Capture 'Hezbollah Official' An Israeli naval force consisting of 25 personnel landed on the coast of Batroun early Friday morning and reportedly detained Hezbollah official Imad Fadel Amhaz from a chalet, according to media reports and security sources. An Israeli official told Axios that 'Israeli Navy SEALs captured Imad Amhaz, a senior member of Hezbollah’s naval force, in an operation in northern Lebanon' to gather intelligence on Hezbollah’s naval activities. Sky News Arabia also reported the abduction in Batroun, with Israel’s Maariv newspaper confirming the capture of a Hezbollah official deep inside Lebanon. However, Lebanon's Caretaker Transportation Minister, Ali Hamieh, told Al-Jadeed TV that the individual taken was a civilian sea captain undergoing a maritime course in Batroun. Hamieh explained that the man had graduated in 2022 and had recently enrolled at the Batroun Maritime Sciences and Technology Institute, living approximately 300 meters from the institute. Shortly after, two Lebanese journalists shared a video online appearing to show around 20 soldiers detaining a man in front of a building, with his face obscured. Kandice Ardiel, a spokesperson for UNIFIL, denied local rumors that U.N. peacekeepers assisted the Israeli force, warning that spreading such misinformation could endanger peacekeepers. Israel has conducted similar operations in the past to capture or target Hezbollah and Palestinian officials within Lebanon. When contacted, the Israeli military stated they were looking into the reports of the incident. Lebanon's National News Agency reported that an 'unidentified military force' conducted a 'sea landing' on Batroun’s shore, arriving fully equipped at a beach chalet to detain a Lebanese man, who was then taken away on a speedboat. An acquaintance of the abducted man identified him as a student at the Maritime Sciences and Technology Institute, though originally from Qmatiyeh, a Shiite-majority town further south. The source mentioned that the man, in his 30s, was known by the institute's faculty as he pursued sea captain training. Batroun, a city with a Christian-majority population, has been relatively untouched by the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, which has severely affected southern Lebanon, Beirut's southern suburbs, and the Bekaa Valley. Since the conflict’s escalation on September 23, over 1,900 fatalities have been reported in Lebanon, though the true number may be higher due to gaps in data.The post Breaking: Israeli Forces Land on Batroun Shore, Capture ‘Hezbollah Official’ first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-land-batroun-shore-capture-hezbollah-official/	2024-11-02T12:29:34-07:00	
UN Peacekeepers Stand Firm in South Lebanon Amid War	The head of U.N. peacekeeping has affirmed that the U.N. force in southern Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, is committed to staying. Beyond its primary mission of monitoring actions by Israel and Hezbollah, the force’s presence also prevents the likelihood that one of the warring factions might take control of U.N. facilities if peacekeepers withdrew. Jean-Pierre Lacroix, in an interview, noted that such a scenario would compromise the U.N.'s image of neutrality and impartiality. At the onset of Israel’s recent offensive in early October, Israel requested that UNIFIL peacekeepers move back 5 kilometers (around 3 miles) from the Lebanese border for their safety. However, the U.N. declined this request, with Lacroix stating that the peacekeepers remain committed to their mandate. Since Israel began ground operations on October 1, UNIFIL’s facilities, including an observation post, have been hit, and eight peacekeepers were injured, though all have since recovered. Recently, Israeli forces blocked a UNIFIL patrol near the Lebanese village of Houla, close to the border. U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric responded by emphasizing the need for all parties to respect the U.N. peacekeepers’ unrestricted freedom of movement in southern Lebanon. Additionally, Dujarric shared data from the U.N. International Organization for Migration, indicating that over 842,000 people have been displaced within Lebanon since October 2023. According to estimates from the Syria Arab Red Crescent, around 469,000 individuals, including men, women, and children, have crossed from Lebanon into Syria since September 23.The post UN Peacekeepers Stand Firm in South Lebanon Amid War first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/un-peacekeepers-stand-south-lebanon-war/	2024-11-02T12:29:18-07:00

UN Leaders Warn of ‘Apocalyptic’ Crisis in Northern Gaza	Fifteen leaders of United Nations agencies issued a stark warning on Friday, describing the conditions in northern Gaza as 'apocalyptic.' This letter, signed by leaders from agencies including OCHA (the UN’s humanitarian affairs office), UNHCR (the UN’s refugee agency), and the World Health Organization (WHO), expressed grave concern for the Palestinian population in North Gaza, who face imminent threats from disease, starvation, and violence. Under siege by Israeli forces for nearly a month, northern Gaza has seen hundreds killed, with attacks impacting hospitals and schools where displaced families have sought shelter. Food scarcity has worsened as livestock perish, farmlands are destroyed, trees are burned, and agricultural infrastructure lies in ruin, the letter noted. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched operations in response to the presence of Hamas members in the area since early October, stating they are making efforts to prevent harm to uninvolved civilians. UN leaders urged Israel to halt its offensive on Gaza and protect humanitarian workers trying to deliver aid, pointing out that the region has been deprived of essential aid and life-saving resources amid ongoing bombardment. They emphasized that international humanitarian law must be observed, including principles of distinction, proportionality, and precautions, underscoring that these obligations remain binding for all parties, regardless of any breaches by others.The post UN Leaders Warn of ‘Apocalyptic’ Crisis in Northern Gaza first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/un-leaders-warn-apocalyptic-crisis-northern-gaza/	2024-11-02T00:46:15-07:00	
Iran Signals Potential to Extend Missile Range, State Media Repor...	Iran is likely to extend the range of its missiles if it perceives an existential threat, according to Kamal Kharrazi, head of Iran’s Strategic Council on Foreign Relations, as reported by Press TV. Kharrazi stated that Iran has previously acknowledged Western sensitivities, particularly those of European countries. However, he indicated that if Iran's territorial integrity is not respected, they would no longer feel compelled to honor these sensitivities, potentially leading to an increase in missile range. Additionally, Kharrazi mentioned that while Iran possesses the capability to develop nuclear weapons, it remains restrained by a directive from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei against weapons of mass destruction, as noted by Press TV. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, addressing Israel's strategic goals as it contends with Hamas and Hezbollah, reaffirmed Israel's primary objective of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. He highlighted that Israel currently has greater operational flexibility in Iran, stating that Israel has the capability to reach any location within Iran if necessary.The post Iran Signals Potential to Extend Missile Range, State Media Reports first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/iran-signals-potential-extend-missile-range/	2024-11-02T00:46:04-07:00

Over 2,200 Killed in Lebanon Since Mid-September, CNN Reports	Since Israel intensified its offensive against Hezbollah in mid-September, at least 2,267 people have been killed and 11,022 injured in Lebanon, based on reports from the Lebanese health ministry compiled by CNN. The ministry’s latest update, released Friday, reported 52 fatalities and 72 injuries in Lebanon's Baalbek-Hermel region, with residents affected across 14 villages in southern and eastern Lebanon. Israel's military stated that its recent strikes targeted Hezbollah sites in southern Lebanon and the capital, Beirut. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) indicated that they took various measures to limit civilian harm, such as issuing prior warnings to residents in the affected areas. However, a CNN correspondent noted that many of the locations hit on Friday had not received warnings through the typical channels, including the IDF's Arabic spokesperson accounts on X and Telegram. The IDF also restated Israel’s stance that Hezbollah has established its weaponry and military infrastructure within civilian neighborhoods across Lebanon. According to Israeli officials, Hezbollah has been launching attacks from these areas, including rocket strikes on Thursday that resulted in the deaths of seven civilians in Israel. On Thursday, Lebanon's health ministry also reported that Israeli strikes have impacted 40 hospitals, 84 medical and ambulance facilities, and a total of 243 healthcare centers, resulting in the deaths of 178 healthcare workers since October of the previous year.The post Over 2,200 Killed in Lebanon Since Mid-September, CNN Reports first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/over-2200-killed-lebanon-since-mid-september/	2024-11-02T00:45:40-07:00	
WHO Sounds Alarm Over Surge in Attacks on Lebanon Healthcare	The World Health Organization expressed grave concern on Friday over Israeli attacks impacting healthcare workers and medical facilities in Lebanon amid its ongoing conflict with Hezbollah. WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris highlighted the alarming toll on healthcare staff and facilities, noting 102 deaths and 83 injuries resulting from these attacks. While the WHO tracks incidents targeting healthcare, it refrains from assigning blame. Harris explained that while WHO has confirmed 55 attacks, Lebanon's Ministry of Health reports even higher figures, as numerous casualties have involved off-duty healthcare workers, intensifying strain on an already overburdened healthcare system. With health workers displaced and facing heavy workloads, their loss further hampers the healthcare response when it is most critical. Harris reiterated that healthcare and health workers must not be targeted, emphasizing the struggle for adequate medical care due to ongoing assaults on Lebanon’s healthcare system. Lebanon’s economic conditions and fuel shortages have already added significant stress to hospital operations, making it increasingly difficult to access care, particularly in areas hit by hospital attacks. The healthcare system is overwhelmed by casualties, Harris said, bearing an immense load. Since the conflict’s intensification on September 23, following nearly a year of cross-border hostilities, the death toll in Lebanon has reached at least 1,829, according to health ministry data compiled by AFP. On Thursday, cross-border fire from Lebanon into Israel led to seven deaths, including four Thai nationals. Israel reports that 37 of its soldiers have died in Lebanon since ground operations began on September 30.The post WHO Sounds Alarm Over Surge in Attacks on Lebanon Healthcare first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/who-alarm-surge-attacks-lebanon-healthcare/	2024-11-01T08:03:01-07:00	
Lebanese Left ‘Orphaned’ as Israel Destroys Homes	Ali Mourad, a law professor, learned through a video that his family’s home in southern Lebanon had been destroyed by Israeli forces. The footage, sent to him by a friend, showed a series of explosions leveling buildings on a hillside, including Mourad’s home in the village of Aitroun, just under a kilometer from the border. Mourad’s father, an 83-year-old pediatrician, had practiced medicine in that building and lived there since Israel ended its 22-year occupation of southern Lebanon in 2000. The family had fled the area again following the eruption of the current conflict on September 23, which followed a year of intermittent cross-border hostilities starting with the Gaza war. The southern region of Lebanon, known as a Hezbollah stronghold, has been heavily bombarded by Israeli airstrikes. Hezbollah claims it is now engaged in close-range combat with Israeli forces in border villages after a recent ground incursion. Mourad, who spent the first two decades of his life unable to visit Aitroun due to Israeli occupation, hopes to pass a connection to this land on to his children, though he fears the ongoing war may sever this bond. For him, returning is not only a right but a way to honor his ancestors and build a future for his children. Lebanon’s National News Agency reported that Israeli forces have destroyed buildings in at least seven border villages. Israeli media also aired footage showing a presenter with Israeli troops detonating a structure in Aita al-Shaab. On October 26, the National News Agency confirmed that Israel destroyed several homes in the village of Adaisseh. That same day, Israel's military detonated 400 tons of explosives in a Hezbollah tunnel extending over 1.5 kilometers near Adaisseh. In Adaisseh, artist Lubnan Baalbaki fears for the family mausoleum where his parents, including his father, the late painter Abdel-Hamid Baalbaki, are buried. The tomb was located in the garden of their now-destroyed home, which had been carefully designed by his father in white stone and clay tiles. Baalbaki, who monitored the property via satellite images, later saw online videos confirming its destruction. He now fears for the tomb’s condition, describing it as his greatest worry. Losing the tomb, he said, would feel like his parents were 'dying a second time.' Baalbaki's Adaisseh home contained a vast library and original artworks by his father, preserved as they were left, including a painting still on an easel. His father, who dedicated his life savings to build the house, left behind his art materials, and the loss of the home filled Baalbaki with sorrow, as it was a project deeply woven into their childhood and inspired their love of art and beauty. The Lebanese National Human Rights Commission has declared Israel’s widespread destruction in southern Lebanon to be a war crime, highlighting the systematic devastation across eight villages between October 2023 and October 2024. Using satellite images and videos shared by Israeli soldiers, the commission reported that Israel’s military demolished homes, schools, mosques, churches, shrines, and archaeological sites with airstrikes, bulldozers, and controlled explosions. Lebanese rights organization Legal Agenda noted that Israeli strikes obliterated most of Mhaibib, destroying 92 civilian buildings and essential facilities. Investigative journalist Hussein Chaabane emphasized that international law prohibits the targeting of civilian sites, and if a military target is present, the principle of proportionality must still be maintained, which he argued is being disregarded in these attacks.The post Lebanese Left ‘Orphaned’ as Israel Destroys Homes first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lebanese-left-orphaned-israel-destroys-homes/	2024-11-01T08:02:44-07:00	
Defiant South Lebanese Stand Firm Amid Israeli Fire	Cattle farmer Khairallah Yaacoub, like a few other residents of war-ravaged southern Lebanon, initially refused to abandon his border village of Houla despite a year of skirmishes between Hezbollah and Israel. When full-scale conflict broke out, Yaacoub and four others found themselves stranded in the wrecked village. Despite the relentless Israeli attacks, Yaacoub tried to stay, but he eventually had to leave after being injured by shrapnel and losing half his herd of 16 cattle to airstrikes. On October 19, three weeks into Israel’s intensified offensive, U.N. peacekeepers rescued Yaacoub and two of the five remaining residents of Houla, where they had been isolated by ongoing bombardment and blocked roads. Two other villagers could not be found, as they lacked mobile phones for communication. Yaacoub, now in his fifties, shared how he was forced to treat his own injuries, using a knife to remove the shrapnel and applying herbal remedies. Despite the danger, he had been determined to remain with his cattle, which were his livelihood. Now safe north of Beirut, he dreams of returning to his village, saying he would go back immediately if a ceasefire were declared. The war has brought widespread displacement across Lebanon. Israel’s airstrikes, which began on September 23 with an initial focus on Hezbollah areas, have since included ground incursions. According to the health ministry, over 1,829 people in Lebanon have lost their lives, while the U.N. reports at least 1.3 million people have been displaced, with 800,000 still inside the country. Many villagers, particularly those in areas that hold memories of previous Israeli occupation, have refused to leave, fearing they might never return. On October 22, U.N. forces evacuated the last two residents of Qawzah, a border village, relocating them to Rmeish, a nearby Christian village that has been safer from attacks. Christian and Druze-majority areas have largely avoided major strikes, while Hezbollah-dominated, Shiite-majority regions continue to bear the brunt of the conflict. Further north, 80-year-old Abu Fadi remains in Tayr Debba, despite Israel’s repeated strikes. Having experienced previous invasions, Abu Fadi, a retired policeman who now runs a coffee stall under an olive tree, feels deeply connected to his land. Although his village, once home to 5,000 people, is nearly deserted and many homes in his neighborhood have been destroyed, he finds comfort knowing his children and grandchildren are safe elsewhere. In addition to airstrikes, southern Lebanese residents have faced detentions by Israeli forces. A Lebanese security official reported that Israeli soldiers temporarily detained a man, Ihab Serhan, and a nun from two border villages. Serhan, who lived with his pets in Kfar Kila, was taken into Israel for questioning but was released about 10 days later. His car was destroyed in a strike, leaving him without essentials as his village became a battlefield. Despite losing his family home, Serhan still clings to his roots, lamenting the loss of the village his father had hoped to return to before his passing.The post Defiant South Lebanese Stand Firm Amid Israeli Fire first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/defiant-south-lebanese-stand-firm-israeli-fire/	2024-11-01T08:02:30-07:00	
Israel Launches Airstrikes on Baalbek	Lebanon’s National News Agency reported on Friday that Israel carried out an airstrike on the eastern city of Baalbek. This attack comes after several intense air raids in the region over recent days. According to the agency, Israeli aircraft targeted the Zahraa neighborhood in Baalbek, a historic area that contains ancient Roman ruins recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site.The post Israel Launches Airstrikes on Baalbek first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-launches-airstrikes-baalbek/	2024-11-01T07:38:51-07:00	
Israeli Airstrikes on Northeastern Lebanon Villages Kill 10	According to Lebanon's state news agency, two Israeli airstrikes in northeastern Lebanon on Friday resulted in ten fatalities. The National News Agency reported that eight people lost their lives when an airstrike demolished a home in the village of Amhaz, while two others were killed in a strike on the village of Taraya. Israel has increased its airstrikes in the Baalbek-Hermel region in northeastern Lebanon this week, leading to dozens of casualties and displacing tens of thousands of residents. Lebanese legislator Hussein Haj Hassan, who represents the area in Parliament, stated that approximately 60,000 people have been forced to leave their homes, with many relocating to safer nearby towns and villages.The post Israeli Airstrikes on Northeastern Lebanon Villages Kill 10 first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-airstrikes-northeastern-lebanon-villages-kill-10/	2024-11-01T07:38:39-07:00	
Hezbollah Ready to Compromise for Truce	Over a month into the ongoing conflict with Israel, Hezbollah has indicated its readiness for a ceasefire, though analysts note there are limits to what it can accept following intense assaults. The Iran-backed group stated on Wednesday that it would be open to a ceasefire under acceptable conditions, acknowledging it had suffered significant damage from Israeli strikes. On the same day, Lebanon’s Prime Minister Najib Mikati revealed he had received indications from U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein that a truce could be established before the U.S. elections on November 5. With the loss of key leaders and the destruction of strongholds, Hezbollah could benefit from the opportunity to regroup that a truce might provide. According to Lebanese analyst Qassim Qassir, close to Hezbollah, a ceasefire would be a priority for the group, allowing it to reorganize. Hezbollah may agree to the Lebanese army’s deployment in the south and avoid the border but won’t accept more stringent demands from Israel, which has called for Hezbollah to pull back around 30 kilometers from the border. Hezbollah, initially engaging in cross-border fire with Israel last year in support of Palestinian ally Hamas, has been put on the defensive since the war escalated on September 23. Israel has killed top Hezbollah leaders, including its chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, his potential successor, creating a leadership gap and exposing an apparent intelligence breach. Israeli forces have advanced close to the town of Khiam, about six kilometers from the border, although Hezbollah insists Israeli forces do not fully control any border villages. In eastern Lebanon, Hezbollah’s infrastructure, including tunnels and arms routes from Syria, have been targeted, with at least two land crossings with Syria closed and flights from Iran, Hezbollah's backer, barred from landing at Beirut’s airport. According to Maha Yahya, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center, Hezbollah’s capabilities have been severely impacted, making rebuilding challenging under current circumstances. Despite initially linking a ceasefire to peace in Gaza, Hezbollah seems to be reconsidering this position, with Mikati suggesting the group is now open to separate truce talks. He also indicated that Hezbollah ministers support implementing the 2006 U.N. Resolution 1701 as part of a ceasefire, which calls for Lebanese Army and U.N. peacekeeper presence in southern Lebanon and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanese territory. David Wood, a senior Lebanon analyst at the International Crisis Group, noted that Hezbollah might accept Resolution 1701’s terms, potentially relocating its forces and infrastructure about 30 kilometers north to areas beyond the Litani River. Wood explained that Hezbollah faces substantial pressure from political opponents and its support base to halt the ongoing destruction, influencing its openness to ceasefire negotiations. Nonetheless, Hezbollah has continued its strikes against Israel, including an attack near Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence, signaling its refusal to settle under unfavorable terms. According to Wood, Hezbollah believes it still has bargaining power and may be able to reach an agreement without a full retreat. Former Lebanese government coordinator Mounir Shehadeh observed that Hezbollah is prepared to follow Resolution 1701, contingent on Israel’s compliance. However, he pointed out Israel’s continued noncompliance since the resolution was established in 2006. A further complication is that many Hezbollah fighters come from the very villages Israel has demanded the group vacate, making relocation complex given the personal ties Hezbollah fighters have to the area.The post Hezbollah Ready to Compromise for Truce first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-ready-compromise-truce/	2024-11-01T07:38:18-07:00	
Berri: Resolution 1701 Is the Only Path to Security and Stability	Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri highlighted on Friday that since at least September, Israel has missed multiple opportunities to establish a ceasefire, enforce Resolution 1701, restore peace, and facilitate the return of displaced individuals on both sides of the border. Berri expressed these concerns during a meeting in Ain el-Tineh with UNIFIL's Head of Mission and Force Commander, Lt. Gen. Aroldo Lázaro. The Speaker emphasized Lebanon’s commitment to upholding Resolution 1701, viewing it as the sole path toward achieving security and stability in the region.The post Berri: Resolution 1701 Is the Only Path to Security and Stability first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/resolution-1701-only-path-security-stability/	2024-11-01T07:38:02-07:00	
Lebanon-Israel Ceasefire Efforts: Latest Updates	U.S. envoys Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk held productive discussions in Israel on Thursday concerning a potential ceasefire in Lebanon, with a U.S. official describing the talks as positive and indicating that significant progress has been made to close gaps between the parties, according to the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation. Meanwhile, LBCI’s correspondent reported that talks are ongoing in Israel over the adjustments that Washington will propose for the ceasefire with Lebanon. LBCI added that Israel’s security cabinet plans to review the forthcoming U.S. proposals on Sunday. An Israeli official, fully briefed on the discussions, told Israel’s Channel 12 that the U.S. and Israeli representatives concluded Thursday’s meeting with plans to continue talks to shape a comprehensive security strategy. The official noted that significant advancements have been made toward establishing security arrangements along the Lebanese-Israeli border.The post Lebanon-Israel Ceasefire Efforts: Latest Updates first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lebanon-israel-ceasefire-efforts-latest-updates/	2024-11-01T07:37:42-07:00	
Yemen’s Houthis Target Vessel in Bab el-Mandeb Strait	On Monday, Yemen's Houthi rebels launched an attack on a ship passing through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, a crucial waterway off the Red Sea, though the vessel avoided any damage, authorities confirmed. This attack marks the end of an 18-day pause in reported Houthi strikes. The Houthis, who have intensified assaults on vessels in the Red Sea corridor over the past year in connection with the Israel-Hamas conflict, have caused significant disruptions to the once $1 trillion shipping route. The British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) center reported that the ship's captain detected two explosions nearby but stated that the vessel and crew remained unharmed. The private security firm Ambrey also noted the explosions occurred close to the ship, which was not broadcasting its location at the time and had private armed guards on board, a practice some vessels have adopted to counter Houthi threats. Houthi military spokesperson Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree claimed responsibility, identifying the ship as the Liberian-flagged bulk carrier *Motaro* and asserted—without evidence—that they struck the vessel. He also claimed two other attacks in the Arabian Sea but did not provide proof. The Houthis, who are backed by Iran, often exaggerate their actions. Their previous strike on Oct. 10 targeted the Liberian-flagged tanker *Olympic Spirit*. The U.S. military responded a week later with B-2 stealth bombers targeting Houthi bunkers. Since the Gaza war began last year, the Houthis have targeted over 90 merchant ships using missiles and drones, seizing one vessel and sinking two others, resulting in the deaths of four sailors. U.S.-led forces have intercepted some attacks in the Red Sea, and other missiles have failed to reach their targets. Despite Houthi claims of targeting ships linked to Israel, the U.S., or the U.K. as a stance against Israel’s operations in Gaza, many attacked ships lack any connection to the conflict, with some bound for destinations like Iran. The Houthis have also shot down multiple American MQ-9 Reaper drones during this period.The post Yemen’s Houthis Target Vessel in Bab el-Mandeb Strait first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/yemens-houthis-target-vessel-bab-el-mandeb-strait/	2024-10-30T02:57:34-07:00	
Hezbollah-Israel Conflict Puts Lebanon’s Fragile Economy at Risk	A humanitarian organization working in Lebanon has analyzed the ongoing Hezbollah-Israel conflict and foresees two potential scenarios, each predicting significant economic downturns for Lebanon by early 2025. According to the Lebanon Crisis Analysis Team from Mercy Corps, Israel’s ongoing strikes on Hezbollah-aligned targets in Lebanon, even without targeting essential infrastructure, will likely lead to substantial economic and humanitarian consequences. Their report suggests that Lebanon’s economy may shrink by 12.81%, or about $2.305 billion, by January 2025. Key sectors, including agriculture, manufacturing, and services in the South and the Bekaa Valley, are expected to be heavily impacted. Agriculture, which supports 80% of the economy in southern Lebanon, could grind to a halt, while the Bekaa Valley’s production—responsible for 2% of the national GDP—could be disrupted as 70% of its farmland faces potential threats, and many Syrian workers flee the area. The service sector, with tourism alone potentially losing $1.256 billion, is also vulnerable, threatening a crucial part of Lebanon’s economic stability. If Israel intensifies its blockade and extends bombings to essential infrastructure, Lebanon’s GDP loss could surge to 21.9%, equating to a $3.938 billion hit, the report warns. Additionally, over 1.5 million people may face displacement, heightening political and intercommunal tensions as Shia Muslims move to regions with different religious demographics, such as predominantly Christian, Druze, or Sunni areas. Already, 1.2 million people have been displaced from areas in southern and eastern Lebanon and from southern suburbs of Beirut. This comes as Lebanon struggles through a five-year economic crisis, marked by a sharp currency devaluation, which had only recently shown signs of stabilization before the conflict reignited.The post Hezbollah-Israel Conflict Puts Lebanon’s Fragile Economy at Risk first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-israel-conflict-puts-lebanons-economy-risk/	2024-10-30T02:57:18-07:00	
Israeli Tanks Advance into Khiam Outskirts in South Lebanon	On Tuesday, Lebanese state media reported that Israeli tanks advanced into the outskirts of Khiam, marking their deepest movement into southern Lebanon since the ground operation began last month. The National News Agency described 'a large number of tanks from the Israeli occupation army' entering the eastern outskirts of Khiam, approximately six kilometers from Israel’s border. Following this incursion, Hezbollah announced it had targeted a Merkava tank near Khiam, resulting in casualties. The group also reported shelling Israeli soldiers on the outskirts of Kfarkila with artillery.The post Israeli Tanks Advance into Khiam Outskirts in South Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-tanks-advance-khiam-outskirts-south-lebanon/	2024-10-30T02:55:30-07:00

The source also clarified that Lebanon’s official stance remains unchanged, despite various media reports.The post Berri and Hochstein Agree on Ceasefire Roadmap first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/berri-hochstein-agree-ceasefire-roadmap/	2024-10-30T02:55:00-07:00	
Israel’s Defense Minister Warns Hezbollah Leader Won’t Last 'Long...	Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant cautioned Hezbollah’s newly appointed leader, Naim Qassem, on Tuesday, hinting that his leadership might be short-lived. Gallant shared a photo of Qassem on X with the caption, 'Temporary appointment. Not for long,' and separately in Hebrew, he posted that the 'countdown has begun.' Hezbollah had announced earlier that Qassem would succeed Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike in south Beirut the previous month. According to Hezbollah, Qassem was elected by its Shura Council, the primary decision-making body, as part of its commitment to maintaining resistance until 'victory' is achieved over Israel, following the outbreak of war on September 23. Qassem, 71, was one of Hezbollah’s original founders in 1982 and had served as deputy secretary general since 1991. He stepped into the spotlight after Nasrallah’s death, having delivered three formal addresses, contrasting with Nasrallah’s more casual style. Although Qassem has less charisma and public presence than his predecessor, he emphasized Hezbollah’s readiness and voiced support for parliamentary speaker Nabih Berri’s efforts to negotiate a ceasefire. He also stated that a ceasefire would be necessary to ensure the safe return of Israeli residents in the north. Hezbollah’s Palestinian ally, Hamas, endorsed Qassem’s appointment, viewing it as proof of the group’s resilience. However, reports suggest that the Shura Council may choose a new leader once the conflict subsides. Since Israel escalated its military actions against Hezbollah in late September, over 1,700 fatalities have been reported in Lebanon, though the actual toll may be higher. The Israeli Defense Forces have reported losing 37 soldiers in the ongoing campaign in Lebanon.The post Israel’s Defense Minister Warns Hezbollah Leader Won’t Last 'Long' first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israels-minister-hezbollah-leader-wont-last/	2024-10-30T02:54:29-07:00	
Israeli Strike on Sidon Kills at Least 5	On Tuesday, two Israeli airstrikes struck the Sidon suburb of Haret Saida, killing at least five people and injuring several others. This marked the second attack on Sidon, a historic coastal city, since tensions between Hezbollah and Israel intensified. According to the National News Agency, the strikes hit an area sheltering displaced individuals near a Hezbollah site known as Sayyed Shohada, located only a few hundred meters from a Lebanese army barracks. Although the specific target of the airstrikes remains uncertain, the casualty count is expected to rise. Earlier that day, Israel’s military had ordered evacuations in 16 villages across southern Lebanon, urging residents to move north of the Awali River. However, no warning was issued before the strikes in Sidon. Israeli warplanes also bombed multiple southern towns, including al-Khiam, Nabatiyeh, Hanine, al-Tiri, Aita al-Shaab, Tebnine, Kfartebnit, Majdalzoun, Tayrharfa, al-Jebbayn, and Aita al-Jabal. Artillery targeted the border town of Rmeish, and another strike hit an Amal-affiliated group, the Islamic Risala Scout Association, as well as a dispensary in Shaqra.The post Israeli Strike on Sidon Kills at Least 5 first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strike-sidon-kills-least-5/	2024-10-30T02:54:14-07:00	
Biden Advisers Head to Israel Tomorrow to Broker End to Lebanon W...	Senior U.S. advisers Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk are set to arrive in Israel on Thursday to work toward a ceasefire deal that could end the conflict in Lebanon and facilitate the return of displaced civilians on both sides of the border, according to sources familiar with the matter, as reported by Axios. Both U.S. and Israeli officials suggest that recent setbacks for Hezbollah, including the loss of its leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, may have prompted the group to consider distancing itself from Hamas in Gaza. Officials believe that a truce between Israel and Hezbollah may be within reach in the coming weeks. On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with ministers and military leaders to discuss the possible agreement. Hochstein’s decision to visit Israel appears to indicate Netanyahu’s interest in pursuing the proposed deal. Hezbollah recently appointed Sheikh Naim Qassem as Nasrallah’s successor, with Al-Arabiya reporting that his appointment aims to expedite a ceasefire. Hochstein, after visiting Beirut last week, received favorable feedback from Lebanese officials regarding a potential ceasefire, irrespective of the ongoing conflict in Gaza. On the Israeli side, there are signals of openness to ending the conflict, with the military nearing the completion of operations in southern Lebanese villages close to Israel’s border. Israeli defense leaders have recommended to Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant that they seek a diplomatic end to avoid a prolonged conflict in Lebanon. The proposed deal involves reviving U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which helped conclude the 2006 Lebanon War. Under this plan, there would be a ceasefire declaration, followed by a 60-day transition period. During this time, Hezbollah would relocate its heavy weaponry north of the Litani River, while around 8,000 Lebanese troops, alongside UNIFIL peacekeepers, would be stationed near the Israeli border, with Israeli forces gradually withdrawing to their side. Israel recently shared its terms for a ceasefire with the U.S., one of which includes 'active enforcement' to prevent Hezbollah from rearming near the border. While not part of the formal agreement, Israel seeks written assurances from the Biden administration that the U.S. will support this enforcement measure. Hochstein and McGurk are expected to meet with Netanyahu, Gallant, and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, where Hochstein will present a formal proposal based on discussions with both sides.The post Biden Advisers Head to Israel Tomorrow to Broker End to Lebanon War first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/biden-advisers-israel-broker-end-lebanon-war/	2024-10-30T02:53:54-07:00
