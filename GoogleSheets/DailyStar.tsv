Arab League Urges Iran to Avoid Fanning Syria’s Strife	The Arab League has urged Iran to refrain from inciting unrest in Syria following the collapse of President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Assad, who had ruled for decades with the backing of Iran, was overthrown on December 8 after an Islamist-led coalition seized control of key cities and advanced to Damascus, forcing him to flee to Russia. This marked a significant loss for Iran, which had relied on Assad as an ally, especially as its Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah, also faced setbacks after a year of conflict with Israel. Despite welcoming Assad back into the Arab League after a decade of isolation, the organization emphasized the importance of respecting Syria’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and stability. It called for disarming all non-state groups and rejecting foreign interventions that destabilize the country. The League expressed concern over recent events in Syria, where clashes between government forces and remnants of Assad’s loyalists have erupted. In response, Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, predicted the rise of a strong group in Syria, suggesting the country's youth, with little to lose, would play a key role. Tehran’s foreign ministry rejected claims of interference in Syria’s internal affairs, asserting its commitment to Syria’s territorial integrity and a unified political system. Syria’s new leadership has criticized Iran’s involvement in the country, urging Tehran to respect Syria’s sovereignty and warning against actions that could lead to further chaos.The post Arab League Urges Iran to Avoid Fanning Syria’s Strife first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/arab-league-iran-avoid-fanning-syrias-strife/	2024-12-28T02:27:08-08:00	
Jumblat Urges Security Agencies to Wake Up	Lebanese Druze leader Walid Jumblatt has called on the country's security agencies to intensify their efforts in apprehending former regime officials who are reportedly fleeing the country. In a post on the X platform, Jumblatt noted that while the Lebanese Foreign Ministry has recently engaged with Syria's new administration, the security agencies have yet to take action against these individuals. He questioned whether the security forces could 'wake up' and arrest the senior officials who are crossing the border and fleeing through the airport. This statement follows Jumblatt's recent visit to Damascus, where he met with Syria's new leadership. During the meeting, Jumblatt expressed hope for the resumption of diplomatic relations between Lebanon and Syria through the establishment of embassies. He also emphasized the importance of holding accountable those responsible for crimes against the Lebanese people and called for fair trials for all perpetrators. Jumblatt's remarks highlight ongoing concerns about the accountability of former regime officials and the need for proactive measures by security agencies to address these issues.The post Jumblat Urges Security Agencies to Wake Up first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/jumblat-security-agencies-wake-up/	2024-12-28T01:20:26-08:00	
Hochstein Set to Reject Iran’s Role in Lebanon Reconstruction	U.S. mediator Amos Hochstein is poised to deliver a firm message to Lebanese officials, asserting that Iran will not be permitted to participate in Lebanon's reconstruction efforts. This stance aims to prevent Iranian influence from infiltrating the rebuilding process, particularly through financial channels that could potentially support Hezbollah. Hochstein's upcoming visit underscores the United States' commitment to ensuring that Lebanon's reconstruction is managed exclusively by the Lebanese government, free from external interference. The U.S. is determined to prevent any Iranian involvement, whether through direct aid or the engagement of Iranian companies, to maintain the integrity of the reconstruction process. This development follows a recent U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, which has significantly altered the regional dynamics. The ceasefire terms require Hezbollah to withdraw heavy weaponry from southern Lebanon, with an American monitoring mechanism to enforce this. However, doubts remain about the ceasefire’s durability due to past enforcement failures of similar agreements. The Lebanese government now faces the critical task of navigating these geopolitical pressures while striving to rebuild the nation. The exclusion of Iran from the reconstruction process is expected to have significant implications for Lebanon's political landscape and its relationships with neighboring countries.

Iran FM Warns Against Interference in Syria’s Future	Iran's foreign minister warned on Friday against any 'destructive interference' in Syria's future, emphasizing that the decisions regarding the country's future should be made solely by its people. Abbas Araghchi, who arrived in Beijing on Friday for his first official visit to China as foreign minister, made the remarks in an article published in the Chinese state media. Both China and Iran have been supporters of the Syrian regime under Bashar al-Assad, who was forced to flee Syria this month after an Islamist-led offensive resulted in the loss of several key cities, including Damascus on December 8. In his article in People's Daily, Araghchi stated that Iran believes it is up to the Syrian people to decide their future, without any external interference or imposition. He reaffirmed Iran's commitment to Syria's sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a strong ally of Assad's regime, expressed confidence on Sunday that a 'strong, honorable group' would rise to oppose the instability in Syria. Khamenei emphasized that Syria's youth would resist those responsible for the chaos and, with determination, overcome the challenges. Araghchi, in his article, highlighted that supporting the Syrian people is a fundamental principle that all international parties should keep in mind. China, which also maintains a close relationship with Assad, has expressed its support for the Syrian people and opposes any forces exploiting the situation to sow further chaos. In 2023, Assad met with Chinese President Xi Jinping, and the two leaders announced a strategic partnership between their countries. During his two-day visit, Araghchi is expected to hold talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. China is Iran's largest trade partner and a key purchaser of its sanctioned oil. Xi Jinping had previously pledged to strengthen ties with Iran during a meeting with Iranian officials in Russia in October. Araghchi described his visit as timely, given the current tensions in the region and international issues, including the ongoing nuclear discussions. He mentioned that both countries share a common viewpoint that calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza should be a top priority in the Middle East.The post Iran FM Warns Against Interference in Syria’s Future first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/iran-fm-warns-interference-syrias-future/	2024-12-27T05:45:13-08:00	
US Presses Israel to End Violations and Withdraw from Lebanon	The United States has intensified its diplomatic efforts, urging Israel to cease its military operations in southern Lebanon and to fully withdraw its forces, as stipulated in the recent ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah. This call comes amid reports of Israeli incursions into southern Lebanon, raising concerns about the implementation of the ceasefire terms. Israeli forces have reportedly advanced into areas beyond the agreed-upon limits, with incursions reaching up to 8 kilometers north of the UN-designated Blue Line. This escalation has led to increased tensions and displacement of local residents. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which includes 380 Irish soldiers, has expressed deep concern over these developments, highlighting the ongoing destruction of residential and agricultural areas. UNIFIL has called for the immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces and adherence to UN Resolution 1701, which mandates a phased Israeli military pullout and the repositioning of Hezbollah fighters. In response to these violations, the U.S. has emphasized the importance of Israel's compliance with the ceasefire agreement. The U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) reported that Israeli forces conducted a withdrawal from a town in southern Lebanon, with the Lebanese military replacing them under the terms of the ceasefire. The U.S. administration has underscored that the future of Syria should be determined solely by its people, free from external interference. This stance aligns with Iran's position, as expressed by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi during his visit to Beijing. Araghchi emphasized Iran's respect for Syria's unity, national sovereignty, and territorial integrity, advocating for decisions to be made by the Syrian people without foreign imposition. The situation remains fluid, with international stakeholders closely monitoring the developments to ensure the full implementation of the ceasefire and the withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon.

Israel Strikes ‘Infrastructure’ on Syria-Lebanon Border	On December 27, 2024, the Israeli military conducted airstrikes targeting infrastructure along the Syria-Lebanon border, specifically near the village of Janta in Lebanon's Beqaa Valley. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) stated that these strikes aimed to dismantle infrastructure utilized by Hezbollah for weapon transfers. The IDF emphasized that Hezbollah exploits civilian infrastructure for terrorist activities and weapon smuggling intended for attacks against Israeli citizens. The military asserted its commitment to removing any threats to Israel in accordance with the understandings outlined in the ceasefire agreement. This military action follows a recent statement from the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which expressed concern over the ongoing destruction by the Israeli military despite a truce agreement with Hezbollah. UNIFIL has called for the withdrawal of Israeli forces and adherence to UN Resolution 1701, which mandates a phased Israeli military pullout and the repositioning of Hezbollah fighters. The situation remains tense, with the IDF asserting its right to defend Israeli citizens and UNIFIL urging compliance with international resolutions to maintain stability in the region.

Houthis Claim Fresh Attacks on Israel After Yemen Airport Strikes	Yemeni rebels, led by the Houthi movement, claimed responsibility for a missile strike on Israel's Ben Gurion airport and drone attacks on Tel Aviv and a ship in the Arabian Sea, following Israeli airstrikes on rebel-held areas in Yemen. These attacks come after a series of airstrikes by Israel, including a raid on Sanaa's international airport, as tensions between Israel and the Houthis escalate. The Israeli strikes, which targeted military sites, power stations, and ports in Yemen's rebel-controlled territories, followed a missile attack from the Houthis. Israel’s military stated the strikes were aimed at disrupting Houthi military infrastructure and halting Iranian weapons smuggling into the region. The United Nations voiced concern over the escalation, with Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemning the attacks on vital infrastructure, which threaten Yemen's already fragile humanitarian operations. UN Chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who had been in Yemen to negotiate the release of detained UN staff, narrowly escaped injury when the Sanaa airport came under bombardment. The Houthis have intensified their attacks against Israel since late November, and their missile and drone assaults have been aimed at Israeli cities and shipping routes in the Red Sea. Israel has retaliated with airstrikes targeting Houthi-controlled regions, including strategic sites in Sanaa and Hodeida, vital for the entry of humanitarian aid. The conflict has been marked by growing tensions between Israel, Yemen’s Houthis, and Iran, which supports the rebel group in their fight against Saudi-led forces in Yemen.The post Houthis Claim Fresh Attacks on Israel After Yemen Airport Strikes first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/houthis-attacks-israel-yemen-airport-strikes/	2024-12-27T05:44:50-08:00	
Mikati Denies Lebanon Was Told Israel Won’t Withdraw After 60 Day...	On Friday, Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati rejected claims from media reports suggesting that Lebanon had been indirectly informed that Israel would not pull out of southern Lebanon after the 60-day period outlined in the ceasefire agreement. Mikati's office described these reports as 'completely unfounded' and emphasized that the prime minister had urged both the U.S. and France to pressure Israel to withdraw from Lebanese territory and end its ongoing violations. Israeli military sources had informed Haaretz newspaper that the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) might need to remain in Lebanon until the Lebanese army fulfills its obligations under the ceasefire agreement, which includes assuming full control of southern Lebanon. The ceasefire agreement, brokered by the U.S. and other nations, has been in effect for 30 days as of Thursday. Haaretz reported that during this period, the IDF had killed 44 Hezbollah militants in strikes related to violations of the ceasefire. The IDF had responded to 25 of the 120 violations by Hezbollah. At present, the IDF is satisfied with the ceasefire's implementation, coordinated with the Lebanese army, and with U.S. involvement in its enforcement. The Israeli military maintains its presence in all Lebanese villages near the border fence, preventing residents from returning. Additionally, the IDF has begun constructing outposts along the northern border, some of which will be located in Israeli-controlled enclaves. Despite this, these outposts do not cross the international border between Israel and Lebanon. The Israeli military estimates that Hezbollah has lost 30% of its manpower and 75% of its firepower since the conflict began, though the group still possesses hundreds of short- and long-range rockets.The post Mikati Denies Lebanon Was Told Israel Won’t Withdraw After 60 Days first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/mikati-denies-lebanon-israel-wont-withdraw/	2024-12-27T05:44:39-08:00	
Watch: Priest with Machine Gun in Church Sparks Outrage in Lebano...	كاهن مزرعة يشوع يدخل الى صلاة العيد حاملاً سلاح حربي pic.twitter.com/AqlZOSNsY1 &mdash; مصدر مسؤول (@fouadkhreiss) December 25, 2024 A video showing a priest with a machine gun slung over his shoulder inside a church in Lebanon’s Mazraat Yachouh has sparked widespread attention and controversy on social media. The Maronite Diocese of Antelias condemned the priest’s actions, clarifying that the stunt, which was not sanctioned by the church, was part of a sermon aimed at emphasizing that 'a believer’s weapon is the cross.' According to a statement from the diocese, the priest placed the weapon in front of the congregation and urged them to abandon all forms of violence that harm others, encouraging them to embrace the cross as the only true weapon—symbolizing love and forgiveness. While the diocese expressed approval of the sermon’s message, which aligns with the church’s teachings, it distanced itself from the method used by the priest. The church issued a written warning, requesting that such actions not be repeated. The diocese also emphasized the importance of preventing the incident from being seen through a sectarian lens and hoped it would not be used to fuel division or resentment, particularly given the current tensions in the country.The post Watch: Priest with Machine Gun in Church Sparks Outrage in Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/priest-machine-gun-church-outrage-lebanon/	2024-12-26T06:34:20-08:00	
Israeli Strike Kills 5 Palestinian Journalists in Gaza	An Israeli airstrike overnight in the Gaza Strip killed five Palestinian journalists outside a hospital, according to the Health Ministry. The attack targeted a car near the Al-Awda Hospital in the Nuseirat refugee camp, located in central Gaza. The journalists were working for the Quds News Network, which also confirmed the strike. The Israeli military stated that it was targeting a group of militants from Islamic Jihad, a group affiliated with Hamas, which launched the October 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, sparking the ongoing conflict. The Committee to Protect Journalists reported that more than 130 Palestinian reporters have been killed since the war began. Israel has restricted access to Gaza for foreign journalists, allowing only military embeds. The conflict started when Hamas militants breached the border in a surprise assault, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking approximately 250 hostages. As of now, about 100 hostages remain in Gaza, with at least a third feared dead. Israel's ongoing air and ground offensive has claimed the lives of more than 45,000 Palestinians, with the Health Ministry stating that over half of the casualties are women and children. The military actions have caused widespread devastation, displacing about 90% of Gaza's population, which totals 2.3 million. Many have sought refuge in overcrowded tent camps along the coast, struggling to endure the harsh winter conditions.The post Israeli Strike Kills 5 Palestinian Journalists in Gaza first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strike-kills-5-palestinian-journalists-gaza/	2024-12-26T06:34:12-08:00	
UNIFIL Condemns Israel’s Destruction of Homes, Infrastructure in ...	The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) issued a warning on Thursday, emphasizing the importance of halting any actions that could jeopardize the fragile ceasefire in southern Lebanon. The organization reiterated that both Israel and Lebanon had committed to fully implementing Security Council resolution 1701 and encouraged both sides to use the newly-established Mechanism to resolve any remaining issues. UNIFIL called for the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) to withdraw from southern Lebanon and for the Lebanese Armed Forces to deploy in the area as part of the full implementation of resolution 1701, which aims to pave the way for peace. The peacekeeping force emphasized that it would continue to support both countries in fulfilling their obligations and monitoring progress. This includes ensuring the area south of the Litani River remains free of armed personnel and weapons, except for those of the Lebanese government and UNIFIL, and upholding respect for the Blue Line. The statement also expressed concern over ongoing destruction caused by Israeli forces in southern Lebanon, including damage to residential areas, farmland, and infrastructure, which it deemed a violation of resolution 1701. UNIFIL peacekeepers will persist in their duties to monitor and report violations of the resolution to the Security Council. A truce between Israel and Hezbollah went into effect on November 27, following an escalation of violence in the region. Since then, both sides have accused each other of violating the ceasefire. The ceasefire agreement stipulated that UNIFIL and the Lebanese Army would redeploy in southern Lebanon, with Israeli forces pulling back over a period of 60 days. The resolution calls for the withdrawal of Israeli troops and the establishment of Lebanese and UNIFIL forces as the only military presence in the area, where Hezbollah holds significant influence. Earlier this week, UNIFIL had urged quicker progress regarding the Israeli military's withdrawal. Meanwhile, Lebanon's National News Agency reported continued Israeli military activities in southern Lebanon, including an incursion into the town of Qantara, which led to residents fleeing to nearby villages. Additionally, Israeli aircraft struck the eastern Baalbek region, far from the border, on Wednesday.The post UNIFIL Condemns Israel’s Destruction of Homes, Infrastructure in South Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/unifil-israels-destruction-homes-infrastructure/	2024-12-26T06:34:01-08:00	
Israeli Army Raids Wadi al-Hujeir, Detains Citizen, Forces Evacua...	On Thursday, Israeli forces violated the ceasefire agreement by entering southern areas including al-Qantara, Adsheet al-Qusayr, and Wadi al-Hujeir, according to the Lebanese Army. The army accused Israel of continuing to breach the ceasefire, undermining Lebanon’s sovereignty, and causing destruction in southern towns and villages. In response, the Lebanese Army increased its presence in the affected areas and continued to monitor the situation in coordination with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and the five-party ceasefire monitoring committee. Israeli forces, advancing in the region, used heavy machine guns and forced residents of al-Qantara to flee to nearby towns like al-Ghandouriyeh and Srifa. Additionally, Israeli forces abducted Lebanese citizen Hossam Fawwaz while he was on his way to work at the UNIFIL Indonesian contingent in Adsheet al-Qusayr. Fawwaz was later released and handed over to UNIFIL and the Lebanese Red Cross, who transported him to receive treatment for a gunshot wound to his head. These incidents led the Lebanese Army to block the road between its post in Qaaqaaiyet al-Jisr and Wadi al-Hujeir, while Israeli Merkava tanks patrolled the valley, accompanied by Israeli machinegun fire. The Majdal Selm Municipality also advised locals to avoid the Slouqi-Hujeir road towards Nabatieh and its surrounding sideroads. Later, a UNIFIL patrol visited the al-Qantara intersection, where Israeli forces were present. The National News Agency reported that Israeli bulldozers were constructing dirt barriers to block the road connecting Wadi Slouqi to Wadi al-Hujeir. In response to these actions, Hezbollah’s Caretaker Labor Minister Mustafa Bayram called for a 'historic lesson' and declared that resistance remains the only viable solution. Hezbollah lawmaker Ali Fayyad condemned the Israeli incursion, labeling it 'extremely dangerous' and a serious threat to the implementation of UN Resolution 1701.The post Israeli Army Raids Wadi al-Hujeir, Detains Citizen, Forces Evacuations first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-army-raids-wadi-al-hujeir-detains-citizen/	2024-12-26T06:33:52-08:00	
Report: Israeli Army Plans Extended Stay in Lebanon Beyond Ceasef...	According to sources within the Israeli military, the Israeli army has stated that it will need to remain in Lebanon until the Lebanese army can fully take control of southern Lebanon, as stipulated by the terms of the ceasefire agreement. This agreement, which was brokered by the U.S. and other nations, came into effect 30 days ago, marking a month since the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. During this period, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) reported that 44 Hezbollah militants were killed in strikes by the IDF for violating the ceasefire. Of the 120 violations recorded, the army launched attacks in response to 25 of them. Currently, the IDF is satisfied with the implementation of the agreement, noting that it has been carried out in cooperation with the Lebanese army and with support from the United States. The Israeli army remains stationed in all Lebanese villages near the border, where residents have not yet been allowed to return. Additionally, the IDF has begun constructing outposts along the northern border, some of which will be positioned in Israeli-controlled areas beyond the border fence. These outposts will not cross the international boundary between Israel and Lebanon, although in certain areas considered vulnerable, the outposts will be located in enclaves beyond the border. The Israeli military believes that Hezbollah has suffered significant losses during the conflict, with an estimated 30% of its manpower and 75% of its firepower destroyed since October 6, 2023. Despite these losses, the defense establishment assesses that Hezbollah still possesses hundreds of short-range rockets and long-range missiles.The post Report: Israeli Army Plans Extended Stay in Lebanon Beyond Ceasefire Terms first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-army-extended-stay-lebanon/	2024-12-26T06:33:42-08:00	
Pakistani Airstrikes Kill 46 in Afghanistan	Airstrikes conducted by Pakistan in Afghanistan's eastern Paktika province have resulted in the deaths of 46 people, according to a spokesperson for the Taliban government. The Pakistani attacks are the latest escalation in the ongoing tensions at the border, which have been rising since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 2021. Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban spokesman, reported that the airstrikes hit four areas in the Barmal district on Tuesday. The majority of those killed were women and children, and six others were injured, also mostly children. The Taliban condemned the airstrikes, calling them 'barbaric' and an act of 'clear aggression.' They stated that they would not let this act go unanswered and emphasized their right to defend Afghan territory and sovereignty. These strikes follow previous clashes at the border, including deadly airstrikes in March by Pakistan that the Taliban said killed eight civilians. Maleel, a local resident of Barmal, reported that one family lost 18 members when a bombardment struck their home, while another attack killed three people in a nearby house. The victims were mostly local residents and others who had fled from Waziristan in Pakistan. The Barmal district borders North Waziristan, an area long associated with militancy. Pakistan had launched a military offensive in this region, along with U.S. drone strikes, during the post-9/11 occupation of Afghanistan. The recent airstrike comes after the Pakistani Taliban (TTP), which shares an ideology with the Afghan Taliban, claimed responsibility for an attack on a Pakistani army outpost last week, killing 16 soldiers. Pakistan has expressed concerns about the Taliban providing sanctuary to TTP fighters, accusing them of launching attacks on Pakistani territory without facing repercussions. The Taliban, however, denies these claims and has promised to expel foreign militant groups. A July U.N. Security Council report estimated that as many as 6,500 TTP fighters are based in Afghanistan, with the Taliban not considering them a terrorist group. This growing violence has further strained relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan. In response to security concerns, Pakistan recently initiated a campaign to expel undocumented Afghan migrants. There has been no official comment from Pakistan regarding the latest airstrike. Meanwhile, high-ranking Taliban officials were meeting with Pakistan’s special envoy for Afghanistan in Kabul on the same day the airstrikes occurred.The post Pakistani Airstrikes Kill 46 in Afghanistan first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/pakistani-airstrikes-kill-46-afghanistan/	2024-12-25T11:13:59-08:00	
Syrians Protest Attack on Alawite Shrine After Shocking Video	Protests erupted across several regions of Syria on Wednesday after a video emerged showing an attack on an Alawite shrine in northern Syria, according to witnesses and a war monitor. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that large demonstrations took place in the coastal cities of Tartus and Latakia, which are home to the Alawite minority, the sect to which former president Bashar al-Assad belongs. Protests were also reported in parts of the central city of Homs and other areas, including Qardaha, Assad's hometown. Witnesses informed AFP that protests took place in Tartus, Latakia, and nearby Jableh, with images from Jableh showing large crowds in the streets chanting slogans such as 'Alawite, Sunni, we want peace.' In response to the unrest, the state news agency SANA reported that authorities in central Homs imposed a curfew from 6:00 pm to 8:00 am, and a similar nighttime curfew was announced in Jableh. The protests followed the circulation of a video earlier that day showing an attack on a significant Alawite shrine in Aleppo's Maysaloon district. The video claimed that five workers were killed in the attack and the shrine was set on fire. Syrian authorities have dismissed the video as 'old,' claiming it showed an incident from earlier in the month when Islamist-led rebels captured northern Aleppo. An interior ministry statement noted that the video was being republished to 'stir up strife' during a sensitive time for the country. Bashar al-Assad has long portrayed himself as the protector of Syria’s minority groups, particularly the Alawites, in a nation dominated by Sunni Muslims.The post Syrians Protest Attack on Alawite Shrine After Shocking Video first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/syrians-protest-attack-alawite-shrine/	2024-12-25T11:13:49-08:00	
Pop Star Alameh’s Mocking of Nasrallah Sparks Outrage in Lebanon	A video that recently circulated online featuring Lebanese pop star Ragheb Alameh speaking on the phone with Emirati singer Abdullah Belkheir sparked anger among many Lebanese citizens. In the video, Alameh appeared to praise the killing of former Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. Nasrallah, a highly revered figure among his supporters and even some non-supporters of Hezbollah, was killed in September during an Israeli airstrike in Beirut's southern suburbs. Lebanon, already deeply divided along sectarian and political lines, was further polarized by this video, with some defending Alameh's comments while others expressed outrage. In the video, Belkheir, speaking on loudspeaker, responded with a laugh after Alameh allegedly stated that 'we've got rid of Nasrallah,' to which Belkheir responded, 'Thank God.' Following the uproar, Alameh claimed that the voice in the video was either generated by AI or someone impersonating him. In the wake of the controversy, a group of individuals attempted to vandalize Alameh's school in Sainte Therese, Hadath. Alameh, who hails from a Shiite family in Ghoubeiry, Beirut, was granted a UAE golden visa in 2021.The post Pop Star Alameh’s Mocking of Nasrallah Sparks Outrage in Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/pop-star-alamehs-mocking-nasrallah-outrage-lebanon/	2024-12-24T05:28:55-08:00	
Army Seizes PFLP-GC Post in Qousaya	The Lebanese Army has taken control of a key site belonging to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command (PFLP-GC) in Qousaya, located in the Beqaa Valley. This move is part of a broader effort by the Lebanese military to assert control over areas previously held by various armed groups. The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) announced that they had successfully entered the PFLP-GC headquarters and deployed units around the site. This operation is part of a larger campaign that includes taking control of additional locations such as Sultan Yacoub and Bar Elias in the Beqaa region. In addition to securing the PFLP-GC sites, the Lebanese Army's efforts include the recent takeover of positions held by the Fatah al-Intifada group, and the dismantling of weaponry and military equipment from these areas. This initiative aligns with the enforcement of UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which aims to maintain peace and security in the region following the 2006 Lebanon War. Furthermore, the Israeli Army has continued its activities in southern Lebanon, including demolition operations and the establishment of new military posts, which complicates the security dynamics in the region. These developments underscore the ongoing tensions and efforts to stabilize the area, involving various regional and international stakeholders.The post Army Seizes PFLP-GC Post in Qousaya first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/army-seizes-pflp-gc-post-qousaya/	2024-12-24T05:28:29-08:00	
Lebanon PM, UN Urge Faster Israeli Withdrawal	United Nations peacekeepers and interim Prime Minister Najib Mikati have urged the Israeli military to expedite its withdrawal from Lebanon, following nearly a month of a delicate ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. UNIFIL, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, emphasized the need for the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) to accelerate their withdrawal and for the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) to take up positions in southern Lebanon. The force called on all parties to adhere to UN Security Council Resolution 1701 and avoid any actions that could disrupt the current fragile peace. Mikati appealed to the United States and France to pressure Israel into completing its withdrawal more swiftly. He stressed that the international committee, comprising the US, France, Lebanon, Israel, and UNIFIL, must ensure that all ceasefire violations are addressed promptly. As part of the ceasefire agreement, the Lebanese army and peacekeepers are to deploy in southern Lebanon as the Israeli forces withdraw over a 60-day period. Mikati, during a visit to the southern town of Khiam, urged for expedited pressure on Israel to halt all ceasefire violations, accusing Israel of stalling. The Lebanese army reported its deployment around Khiam, five kilometers from the border, in coordination with UNIFIL following the Israeli troop withdrawal. However, the Lebanese National News Agency (NNA) noted continued Israeli activities in southern Lebanon, including raising the Israeli flag on a hill between Bayada and Naqoura and dynamiting homes in border villages. The Israeli military, on the other hand, stated it was continuing defensive operations in the south in line with the agreement and had confiscated various weapons and military equipment from a warehouse. The ceasefire, effective since November 27, followed more than a year of cross-border hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, which escalated into full-scale war and the deployment of Israeli troops into southern Lebanon. Mikati expressed his desire to resolve any disputes regarding the Blue Line, the UN-demarcated boundary between Lebanon and Israel, to eliminate any justification for Israeli occupation. He also mentioned efforts to establish a trust fund for reconstruction, with support from the World Bank, the European Union, Arab nations, and international partners. The World Bank estimated in October that the conflict had caused physical damage in Lebanon amounting to at least $3.4 billion.The post Lebanon PM, UN Urge Faster Israeli Withdrawal first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lebanon-pm-un-faster-israeli-withdrawal/	2024-12-24T05:28:20-08:00	
Netanyahu Reports ‘Some Progress’ in Ceasefire, Hostage Deal	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has indicated there is some advancement in the negotiations for a hostage and ceasefire deal in Gaza, though he did not specify a timeline for a potential agreement. Around 100 of the approximately 250 individuals taken hostage during the Hamas-led raid on Israel on October 7, 2023, remain in Gaza. It is believed that at least a third of these hostages are deceased. Addressing the Knesset on Monday, Netanyahu stated that significant measures are being taken across various channels to secure the return of the hostages. He cautiously noted that there is some progress in these efforts. Netanyahu did not disclose specific actions being undertaken to facilitate the hostages' release. He attributed the progress to the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and Israel's military operations against Iran-backed Hezbollah militants, who have been launching rockets into Israel from Lebanon in support of Hamas. Netanyahu highlighted that Hamas had expected support from Iran and Hezbollah, but these groups are currently focused on recovering from the setbacks inflicted by Israel. He also mentioned the continuous military pressure being applied on Hamas in Gaza. Netanyahu concluded by emphasizing that while there is progress, the duration of the efforts remains uncertain.The post Netanyahu Reports ‘Some Progress’ in Ceasefire, Hostage Deal first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/netanyahu-some-progress-ceasefire-hostage-deal/	2024-12-24T05:28:08-08:00	
Watch: Israel Admits to Killing Ex-Hamas Leader Haniyeh in Tehran	In a significant development, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz has publicly acknowledged that Israel was responsible for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July 2024. Haniyeh, who had been Hamas's overall leader until his death, was killed during a visit to Tehran. This admission marks the first time Israel has officially claimed responsibility for the operation. Minister Katz emphasized that Israel's actions against leaders of groups such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and other Iranian-backed organizations are part of a broader strategy to counter regional threats. The acknowledgment of Haniyeh's assassination is expected to further escalate tensions between Israel and Iran, as well as with other regional actors.

Israel Frees 7 Civilians Detained in South Lebanon After Truce	On Sunday, Israeli forces handed over seven detainees to United Nations peacekeepers at the border as part of a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. According to Lebanese state media, the prisoners had been held by Israel after the ceasefire came into effect. This event follows Israel's intensified military operations in southern Lebanon, which began in late September, after Hezbollah's cross-border attacks in support of Hamas. These actions were in response to the October 7, 2023, Hamas assault on southern Israel. A ceasefire was established on November 27, though both sides have accused each other of violations since then. The seven detainees were transferred to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) at Ras Naqoura, then taken to a hospital for medical checkups with assistance from the Lebanese Red Cross and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Afterward, they were sent to Sidon for further investigation. The ceasefire agreement stipulated that the Lebanese army would deploy in southern Lebanon alongside UN peacekeepers, while Israel would begin withdrawing its forces over a 60-day period. Hezbollah was also required to relocate its forces north of the Litani River, and dismantle its military infrastructure in the south. In the meantime, the Israeli army claimed to have located and destroyed a combat compound in southern Lebanon containing several weapons storage facilities. Despite the ceasefire, Israel has continued to carry out military actions, including bombings in the towns of Kfar Kila and Bint Jbeil, leading to condemnation from Lebanese media regarding repeated attacks on southern villages.The post Israel Frees 7 Civilians Detained in South Lebanon After Truce first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-frees-7-civilians-south-lebanon-truce/	2024-12-23T04:03:04-08:00	
Mikati Tours Military Positions in South Lebanon	Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati has initiated a visit to military positions in southern Lebanon, nearly a month after a ceasefire agreement ended the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. This marks Mikati's first trip to the southern frontlines, where, as per the U.S.-mediated deal, Lebanese troops are set to gradually deploy. Both Hezbollah fighters and Israeli forces are expected to pull back by the end of next month. Mikati's tour follows ongoing frustration from the Lebanese government over Israeli airstrikes and overflights. After meeting with Lebanese Army Commander Joseph Aoun at a military base in Marjayoun, Mikati emphasized the tasks ahead. He stressed the importance of ensuring Israel’s withdrawal from the territories it had occupied during its recent military actions, stating that this would enable the Lebanese army to fully carry out its duties. The Lebanese military has long depended on foreign aid, particularly from the U.S. and other Western nations, to maintain its operations. With the conflict’s conclusion and the ceasefire in place, Lebanon hopes that additional funding will bolster the army’s capacity to establish a stronger presence in the south, where Hezbollah’s armed units had been active. Despite not directly engaging in combat, numerous Lebanese soldiers were killed in Israeli airstrikes targeting their positions or patrols in the region.The post Mikati Tours Military Positions in South Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/mikati-tours-military-positions-in-south-lebanon/	2024-12-23T04:02:54-08:00	
Iran’s Khamenei Predicts Syrian Youth Will Resist New Government	Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has expressed confidence that young Syrians will resist the new government following the fall of Bashar al-Assad. He pointed out that these young individuals, who now face instability after Assad's ousting, have 'nothing to lose' and are likely to resist the new order. Khamenei emphasized that these Syrians should stand firm against those he believes are responsible for the insecurity in the country. He reiterated accusations that the U.S. and Israel were behind the instability in Syria, claiming they aimed to exploit the country’s resources. Iran has been a key supporter of Assad’s regime during Syria's civil war, which began after Assad's violent crackdown on protests. Syria has also served as a critical route for Iranian support to Hezbollah. Khamenei's remarks came after a year of significant losses for Iran's regional allies, including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, which was forced to agree to a ceasefire after heavy Israeli strikes. Despite the setbacks, Khamenei denied that groups like Hezbollah and Hamas act as Iranian proxies, asserting that these groups fight due to their own convictions. He further stated that if Iran ever needed to take action, it would not rely on proxy forces.The post Iran’s Khamenei Predicts Syrian Youth Will Resist New Government first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/irans-khamenei-syrian-youth-resist-new-government/	2024-12-23T04:02:33-08:00	
Khamenei Denies Having or Needing Regional Proxy Forces	Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei rejected claims that militant groups in the region act as Tehran's proxies, stating that if Iran needed to take action, it would not rely on them. His comments came amid significant losses for Iran-backed groups such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, both of which faced defeats in their ongoing conflicts with Israel. Additionally, the fall of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, a key ally in Iran’s so-called axis of resistance, added to the regional shifts. Khamenei insisted that groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, and Yemen's Houthi rebels are motivated by their own beliefs, not by Iran's influence. He emphasized that these groups fight because of their faith, not as part of a proxy network for Tehran. Khamenei further dismissed American claims that Iran had lost control over its regional proxies, asserting that Iran would not need proxy forces if it chose to take action. The collapse of Assad’s regime earlier this month marked a significant shift in the regional balance, as Assad had long been a key partner for Iran, especially in supporting Hezbollah. Khamenei expressed confidence that Syria would soon see the rise of a strong, independent group of fighters, predicting that Syria’s youth, who have nothing to lose, would form this group. He also accused the United States of attempting to destabilize Iran, promising that the Iranian people would reject any foreign influence or attempts to interfere with their sovereignty.The post Khamenei Denies Having or Needing Regional Proxy Forces first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/khamenei-denies-needing-proxy-forces/	2024-12-23T04:02:25-08:00	
Ex-Israeli Spies Reveal Hezbollah Pager Attack Details	Two recently retired senior Israeli intelligence officers revealed new details about a covert operation targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria, which utilized explosive devices hidden in pagers and walkie-talkies. The operation, years in the making, was carried out three months ago and was revealed in a segment on CBS’s '60 Minutes.' The operation began over a decade ago with walkie-talkies laced with explosives, which Hezbollah unwittingly purchased from Israel. The walkie-talkies weren’t detonated until September, a day after the pagers, which had been rigged to explode, were triggered. The explosive devices were part of a larger plan to strike Hezbollah militants. In 2022, Mossad learned that Hezbollah was acquiring pagers from a Taiwanese company and decided to turn the situation to their advantage. The pagers were altered to accommodate explosives and tested to ensure they would cause harm only to the target while minimizing risk to bystanders. Mossad also experimented with various ringtones to ensure the pagers would be noticed. The operation also involved deceiving Hezbollah into thinking it was purchasing equipment from legitimate suppliers, using false ads and shell companies to mislead the Taiwanese firm. The pagers were marketed as rugged and efficient, convincing Hezbollah to buy a new, larger model with hidden explosives. By September, Hezbollah had acquired thousands of these altered pagers. The explosive devices were detonated on September 17, causing widespread panic. The following day, Mossad activated the walkie-talkies, some of which exploded during funerals for victims of the pager explosions. The explosions were intended to send a powerful message to Hezbollah, demonstrating Israel’s technological superiority and the cost of challenging Israel. The explosions caused significant psychological impact in Lebanon, with people fearing further attacks from everyday objects. Israel’s air strikes soon followed, leading to heavy casualties, including the assassination of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. The operation concluded with a ceasefire by November. The Israeli agents behind the operation explained that the aim was not just to kill but to cripple Hezbollah, creating visible, long-lasting reminders of Israel’s power in the region. The fear instilled in the population, they explained, was part of the psychological warfare that Israel hoped to maintain as a deterrent.The post Ex-Israeli Spies Reveal Hezbollah Pager Attack Details first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/ex-israeli-spies-hezbollah-pager-attack-details/	2024-12-23T04:02:10-08:00	
Yemeni Missile Strikes Tel Aviv, Say Israel and Houthis	A missile fired from Yemen hit Tel Aviv early on Saturday, marking a rare failure in the city's missile defense system. Israeli authorities confirmed that the missile landed in the southern Jaffa area of Tel Aviv. Despite air defense efforts, the missile was not intercepted, and sirens sounded before the impact. Emergency services reported that more than a dozen people sustained minor injuries, primarily from broken glass, but no fatalities occurred. The Houthis in Yemen, backed by Iran, claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that they launched a hypersonic ballistic missile, named 'Palestine 2,' which accurately struck its target. At least 16 people were treated for minor injuries, while others sought shelter or suffered panic-related symptoms. One resident described the explosion as terrifying, with windows shattered in nearby buildings. Tel Aviv, Israel's commercial and diplomatic hub, is rarely hit by direct missile strikes due to the country's advanced air defense system. However, since the war with Hamas began in October 2023, Israel has faced missile attacks from other Iran-backed groups, including Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. Most of these missiles have been intercepted by Israel's defense systems. The Houthis have been targeting ships in the Red Sea in response to the ongoing Gaza conflict, and their attacks, alongside those from Hamas and Hezbollah, are part of a broader Iran-led alliance. This coalition has vowed to continue striking Israel and its allies until a ceasefire is achieved in Gaza. The attacks intensified following Hamas's deadly assault on Israel on October 7, 2023, which sparked the ongoing conflict.The post Yemeni Missile Strikes Tel Aviv, Say Israel and Houthis first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/yemeni-missile-strikes-tel-aviv/	2024-12-22T01:07:16-08:00	
Israel and Hamas Near Ceasefire Deal: Key Sticking Points Reveale...	Israel and Hamas are reportedly closer to reaching a ceasefire agreement that could end the 14-month war in Gaza and facilitate the return of numerous hostages. However, previous attempts to reach a deal have failed due to unresolved issues, and this round of talks faces its own set of challenges. The proposed ceasefire deal would be implemented in stages, starting with a halt in fighting, followed by the exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and a significant increase in humanitarian aid to Gaza. The final phase would see the release of any remaining hostages, the end of the war, and discussions on Gaza's reconstruction. Although there is optimism on both sides, key obstacles remain, particularly regarding which hostages and prisoners will be exchanged and the status of Israeli troops in Gaza. Israeli officials are working on determining the list of hostages to be released in the first phase, which is expected to focus on women, the elderly, and those with medical conditions. Negotiations also continue over the exact number of Palestinian prisoners to be freed, with Hamas pushing for the release of high-profile detainees. In addition, Israel’s decision to withdraw troops from Palestinian population centers is another sticking point. While there is an expectation that some displaced people will be allowed to return to Gaza, the specifics of the withdrawal and the areas from which people can return remain unresolved. Israel is particularly concerned about the return of displaced people to areas near the Israeli border, fearing that militant activity could resume from those regions. The ongoing talks are also complicated by political pressures in Israel, with some factions opposing concessions, particularly the release of prisoners involved in violent attacks. Furthermore, some Israeli officials suggest more drastic measures, including proposals to empty northern Gaza and cut off humanitarian aid in a bid to eliminate militants. U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, have expressed hope that an agreement could be finalized before President Joe Biden’s term ends on January 20, 2025, aiming to bring relief to the people of Gaza and secure the release of hostages.The post Israel and Hamas Near Ceasefire Deal: Key Sticking Points Revealed first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-hamas-ceasefire-key-points/	2024-12-21T08:27:47-08:00	
Erdogan Calls for Eradication of IS and Kurdish Fighters in Syria	Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared on Friday that it is essential to eliminate groups that threaten Syria's survival, particularly the Islamic State (ISIS) and Kurdish fighters. Erdogan emphasized the need to neutralize terrorist organizations like ISIS and the PKK, as well as their affiliates, to ensure Syria's stability. He referred to the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which include the Kurdish YPG militia, as a terror organization due to its links with the PKK, a group involved in a long-standing insurgency against Turkey. While the SDF played a critical role in the fight against ISIS in Syria, especially in 2019, the United States views them as essential to preventing the resurgence of jihadist forces. Erdogan stressed that Turkey is taking preventive actions against groups that pose a risk to its security and expressed confidence that Syria’s new leadership would refrain from collaborating with such organizations. He warned that the leaders of these groups, including ISIS and the PKK-YPG, would be swiftly targeted. Furthermore, Erdogan mentioned that Turkey’s foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, is set to visit Damascus soon, following a recent meeting between Turkey's spy chief, Ibrahim Kalin, and the leadership of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) in Syria, which occurred just days after the fall of Assad's government.The post Erdogan Calls for Eradication of IS and Kurdish Fighters in Syria first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/erdogan-eradication-is-kurdish-fighters-syria/	2024-12-21T08:27:35-08:00	
Yemeni Rocket Strikes Tel Aviv, 16 Injured	The Israeli military reported that a rocket launched from Yemen struck an area near Tel Aviv early on Saturday, injuring 16 people with glass shards from nearby windows. Another 14 individuals sustained minor injuries while rushing to shelters when air raid sirens were activated shortly before the attack at 4 a.m. local time. This incident follows Israeli airstrikes on Yemen's Houthi-controlled capital, Sanaa, and the port city of Hodeida two days prior, which resulted in at least nine deaths. These strikes were retaliation for a missile attack by the Houthis that hit an Israeli school building. The Houthis also claimed responsibility for a drone strike on an unspecified Israeli military target earlier in the week. The Israeli military has reported that the Iran-backed Houthis have launched over 200 missiles and drones during the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Additionally, the Houthis have been targeting shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, promising to continue these attacks until a ceasefire is established in Gaza. The recent Israeli strikes have significantly damaged the Houthi-controlled Red Sea ports, particularly the Hodeida port, which is crucial for food shipments to Yemen. The United Nations has expressed concern over the escalating violence, warning that both sides' actions could further destabilize the region and undermine ongoing U.N. mediation efforts.The post Yemeni Rocket Strikes Tel Aviv, 16 Injured first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/yemeni-rocket-strikes-tel-aviv-16-injured/	2024-12-21T08:27:24-08:00	
Two Dead, 60 Injured as Car Plows into Germany Christmas Market	A tragic incident occurred on Friday in the German city of Magdeburg when a car drove into a busy outdoor Christmas market, resulting in the deaths of at least two people and injuries to over 60 others. Authorities have labeled the incident a deliberate attack. The car crashed into the market around 7 p.m., a peak time for holiday shoppers, and the driver was promptly arrested at the scene. Footage of the arrest showed the suspect lying on the ground as officers took him into custody. The two confirmed fatalities were an adult and a child, but there are concerns that more lives may have been lost, as 15 people sustained serious injuries. The attack shocked the city, with the mayor visibly emotional and the event tarnishing a festive tradition that dates back centuries. The tragedy prompted several other German cities to cancel their weekend Christmas markets in solidarity. The suspect, a 50-year-old Saudi doctor who has lived in Germany since 2006, was practicing in Bernburg, a town near Magdeburg. Officials confirmed he acted alone, and there was no ongoing threat to the city. This incident is a grim reminder of a similar attack in 2016, when an Islamic extremist drove a truck into a Christmas market in Berlin, killing 13 people. In the wake of the attack, the German government and public figures expressed their condolences, with flags to be lowered to half-staff across Saxony-Anhalt. International leaders also voiced support, including German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and U.S. Vice President-elect JD Vance. Magdeburg’s mayor announced plans for a memorial at the city's cathedral, and a minute of silence was held at a football match later that evening in honor of the victims.The post Two Dead, 60 Injured as Car Plows into Germany Christmas Market first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/two-dead-60-injured-car-plows-germany-christmas-market/	2024-12-21T08:27:14-08:00	
Three Bodies Found After Israeli Strike on Nasrallah	Lebanese rescuers recovered three bodies from the ruins of a building in Beirut that was hit by an Israeli airstrike in September, which also resulted in the death of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. The health ministry has not provided a confirmed death toll for the strike that destroyed several buildings in Haret Hreik, a Hezbollah stronghold in southern Beirut. On Friday morning, rescuers began searching for seven people still missing at the site, with the National News Agency reporting the recovery of three bodies. These remains were transported to Rafik Hariri University Hospital in Beirut for DNA testing to confirm their identities. Search efforts continued for other missing individuals. The Israeli airstrike on September 27 targeted Nasrallah in an underground bunker within a residential area. Nasrallah was killed along with four others, including Hezbollah's southern Lebanon commander and a senior member of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. His burial took place at a secret location to avoid Israeli targeting of his funeral. Although a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah began on November 27, bringing an end to a conflict that claimed over 4,000 lives in Lebanon, Israeli airstrikes have continued to kill more than 20 people in the country since that time. Both Israel and Hezbollah have accused each other of violating the ceasefire agreement.The post Three Bodies Found After Israeli Strike on Nasrallah first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/three-bodies-found-israeli-strike-nasrallah/	2024-12-21T08:26:51-08:00	
Gemayel Vows No Revenge, Calls for Unity as Lebanon ‘Rises Again’	Kataeb leader Sami Gemayel stated on Friday that Hezbollah should understand that the Lebanese people will no longer accept being under its control or treated as second-class citizens. He emphasized that his stance is not about seeking revenge, nor about excluding or isolating anyone, including Hezbollah, Amal, and their supporters. However, he made it clear that all groups must abide by the law and the constitution. He also stressed that the era of chaos has ended, and moving forward, no group other than the Lebanese army should be allowed to hold arms. Gemayel, in preparation for the presidential vote set for January 9, reiterated that the next president must uphold the ceasefire agreement. However, his party and other opposition groups have not yet agreed on a candidate. The ceasefire agreement from November stipulates that the Lebanese army and UN peacekeepers will be the only armed forces in southern Lebanon, an area that has historically been under Hezbollah's influence. Gemayel expressed optimism for Lebanon's future, declaring that the obstacles which once hindered state-building and isolated Lebanon from its Arab neighbors and the international community are now gone.The post Gemayel Vows No Revenge, Calls for Unity as Lebanon ‘Rises Again’ first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/gemayel-no-revenge-calls-unity/	2024-12-20T08:51:43-08:00	
US Delegation Holds Talks with al-Jolani in Damascus	U.S. diplomats met Syria's newly appointed leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, on Friday, marking the first official contact since the fall of former president Bashar al-Assad. This meeting comes amid international concerns over the direction of Syria’s leadership, with many powers seeking assurances that the country’s new authorities will be moderate and inclusive, particularly in regard to the rights of minorities, women, and the Kurdish population. The rapid offensive that led to Assad's removal was spearheaded by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a group originally linked to al-Qaeda but which has recently presented itself as more moderate. The unexpected shift in power has forced foreign governments, especially the U.S., to reassess their policies, given HTS is considered a terrorist organization by some countries. Although the U.S. delegation had planned a press conference, it was canceled due to security concerns. The diplomats are also engaging with various Syrian civil society groups and minorities. Among those in the U.S. delegation are Barbara Leaf, a senior State Department official, and a representative handling cases involving American hostages, including Austin Tice, a journalist abducted in Syria in 2012. In parallel, international discussions have emphasized the need for a non-sectarian, inclusive Syrian government. This was echoed at a recent summit in Aqaba, Jordan, where various regional powers, including Turkey, stressed the importance of maintaining Syria’s territorial integrity. Turkey, which opposed Assad during the war, also voiced concerns about Kurdish forces in Syria, which it considers linked to the PKK, a designated terrorist group. Kurdish-led forces in northeastern Syria, under the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), have been a key player in the region, but their future remains uncertain, especially in the face of Turkish pressure. While Kurdish leaders welcomed the fall of Assad, many fear further Turkish military action in their territories. In Syria itself, protests erupted in response to comments by the interim government, particularly regarding the role of women in politics. A spokesperson for the new government suggested that female representation in ministries or parliament was premature. This sparked outrage, with women leaders vowing to hold the government accountable for any move that undermines gender equality. International bodies, like the UN's migration agency, have also called for increased empowerment of women in Syria’s rebuilding process. The civil war, which claimed over 500,000 lives, has led to widespread displacement and human rights abuses. Following Assad's ousting, mass graves and prisons holding thousands of victims of torture have been uncovered, further highlighting the need for accountability and reconciliation as Syria moves forward.The post US Delegation Holds Talks with al-Jolani in Damascus first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-delegation-talks-al-jolani-damascus/	2024-12-20T08:51:34-08:00	
Turkey, Iran Leaders Hold Talks at Cairo Muslim Summit	The leaders of Turkey and Iran held a meeting in Cairo at a summit involving eight Muslim-majority countries, marking their first direct talks since the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Historically, Turkey and Iran have supported opposing sides in Syria’s prolonged civil war, with Turkey backing the opposition and Iran standing by Assad’s government. During the summit, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan emphasized Turkey’s desire for a stable and secure Syria, where terrorism is eradicated and the country’s territorial integrity is preserved. The Turkish presidency issued a statement in which Erdogan also stressed the importance of maintaining Syria’s unity. Similarly, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian’s office issued a statement underscoring Iran’s position against any threat to Syria’s territorial integrity. He also called for Muslim nations to take a strong stance against Israel's actions in the region. This meeting took place amid a backdrop of regional instability, including the ongoing war in Gaza, a fragile ceasefire in Lebanon, and unrest in Syria. Pezeshkian, addressing the summit, described it as a moral obligation for Muslim countries to act to prevent further harm in conflict zones. The summit, held by the D-8 Organization for Economic Cooperation (also known as the Developing-8), marked the first visit of an Iranian president to Egypt since Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s visit in 2013. Diplomatic relations between Egypt and Iran, which have been strained for years, have recently improved, particularly after Egypt took on a mediator role in the Gaza conflict. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi visited Egypt in October, and Egypt’s Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty had traveled to Tehran earlier in July. This is also Erdogan’s second visit to Egypt this year, with his previous visit in February being his first trip to the country as president since 2012, when he was prime minister.The post Turkey, Iran Leaders Hold Talks at Cairo Muslim Summit first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/turkey-iran-leaders-talks-cairo-muslim-summit/	2024-12-20T08:51:25-08:00	
Israeli Army Withdraws from Bani Hayyan, Lebanese Forces Deploy A...	Israeli forces pulled out of the southern town of Bani Hayyan on Friday, two days after they entered the area. They moved their operations toward Markaba after carrying out demolitions, including bulldozing homes and clearing roads. The Bani Hayyan Municipality reported on Thursday that an elderly woman inside the town had gone missing during the incursion, and her whereabouts remain unclear. In addition to the actions in Bani Hayyan, Israeli forces also conducted detonations in Naqoura, a town in southern Lebanon. Meanwhile, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and the Lebanese Army deployed on Friday in the valleys along the Litani River, between several locations, including Deir Siryan, Alman, al-Qusayr, and Zawtar al-Sharqiyeh. This deployment followed recommendations from the committee overseeing the ceasefire. The Lebanese Army and UNIFIL are setting up checkpoints and other fixed positions at the entrances to the southern Litani sector and along the riverbanks, stretching from Marjayoun to al-Qasmiyeh.The post Israeli Army Withdraws from Bani Hayyan, Lebanese Forces Deploy Along Litani first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-army-withdraws-bani-hayyan/	2024-12-20T08:51:15-08:00	
Army Chief Joseph Aoun: Jumblat’s Pick, Gemayel’s Ally	Former leader of the Progressive Socialist Party, Walid Jumblat, along with the Democratic Gathering bloc, has officially endorsed Army Chief General Joseph Aoun for the upcoming presidential election, set for January 9. Jumblat's announcement makes him one of the first political figures to publicly back a candidate. Jumblat's support for Aoun stems from his belief in the army's crucial role in Lebanon’s stability. He praised Aoun for his leadership, emphasizing that the army is an essential institution for the security and stability of the country. The Lebanese army holds a respected position in Lebanon, known for bridging divides in a politically fragmented society. Recently, the army has played a key role in the implementation of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon, particularly in southern Lebanon, where the Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeepers are now the only armed entities allowed. Hezbollah, a powerful political and military group, has stated that it is cooperating with the army in this effort. The situation is marked by a stark divide: Hezbollah and its ally Amal support a presidential candidate who would protect their influence and maintain Hezbollah's right to defend Lebanon. In contrast, opposition forces advocate for a president who would disarm Hezbollah and ensure that only the Lebanese army is responsible for defending the country and maintaining order, particularly in southern Lebanon, which borders Israel. Kataeb leader Sami Gemayel, speaking on behalf of the opposition, expressed support for a president committed to enforcing the ceasefire agreement and ensuring that only the Lebanese army possesses weapons. However, no opposition candidate has been agreed upon as of yet. The ceasefire, which was brokered by the U.S. and France, calls for the withdrawal of Hezbollah and Israeli forces from southern Lebanon, with the Lebanese army taking full control in the area. This move aims to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which was initially passed in 2006 to end hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel. Resolution 1701 stipulates that the Lebanese state, in partnership with the U.N., should be the exclusive armed presence in the region, a provision that has not been fully enforced until now. Gemayel confirmed that the opposition is still in the process of consulting with each other, but reiterated that they will not announce their presidential candidate until these talks conclude.The post Army Chief Joseph Aoun: Jumblat’s Pick, Gemayel’s Ally first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/joseph-aoun-jumblats-pick-gemayels-ally/	2024-12-20T08:51:08-08:00	
UN Chief Sees Hope in Syria, Urges End to Israeli Strikes	U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed hope for Syria on Thursday, noting a 'flame of hope' following the downfall of President Bashar al-Assad's regime, but also acknowledged the significant hurdles ahead. Guterres emphasized that the Middle East is engulfed in numerous conflicts, yet Syria's situation offers a glimpse of potential progress that must not be extinguished. He also criticized Israel's ongoing air strikes on Syrian military targets, including air force and naval installations, calling them violations of Syria’s sovereignty. He called for an end to these strikes, urging that they must cease immediately. Ahead of a U.N. Security Council meeting, Guterres suggested that the international community consider easing sanctions on Syria as a first step towards fostering solidarity with the Syrian people. However, he noted that this would only be feasible once conditions are in place to remove all sanctions. In Syria, the HTS, an Islamist group with Al-Qaeda roots and support from Turkey, recently seized control of Damascus. They have pledged to protect minorities following the ousting of Assad's government. Despite these changes, the international community remains cautious, hesitant to lift sanctions or take further steps until it is clear how the new authorities will govern the country.The post UN Chief Sees Hope in Syria, Urges End to Israeli Strikes first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/un-hope-syria-urges-end-israeli-strikes/	2024-12-19T10:10:17-08:00	
Israel Hits Yemen Capital After Houthi Missile Targets Central Is...	Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for a missile attack on Israel Thursday, which the Israeli military intercepted before it could reach its territory. Israel responded with airstrikes targeting Houthi infrastructure in Yemen, including power stations, oil facilities, and ports, resulting in casualties. The Houthis, who have repeatedly targeted Israel since the Gaza conflict began, are part of the Iran-backed 'axis of resistance,' which also includes Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu warned that the Houthis would face severe consequences for their actions. He described the group as one of the last remaining arms of Iran's influence, following the weakening of Hezbollah and the fall of the Assad regime in Syria. Israel’s military stated that the intercepted missile was launched from Yemen, triggering sirens in parts of Israel. Israel’s retaliatory strikes reportedly caused significant damage in Yemen, including casualties at Hodeida and Sanaa. While the Iranian government condemned Israel’s actions as a violation of international law, Palestinian militant group Hamas also criticized Israel’s response. This missile interception marked the second this week after a similar incident on Monday, and the Houthis have vowed to continue their operations in support of Palestinians in Gaza. They have previously attacked shipping routes in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, leading to retaliatory strikes by U.S. and British forces. Israeli officials have expressed concerns that the Houthis, supported by Iran, are emerging as a growing global threat.The post Israel Hits Yemen Capital After Houthi Missile Targets Central Israel first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-hits-yemen-capital-houthi-missile/	2024-12-19T10:10:07-08:00	
Latest Updates on Gaza Ceasefire Talks	Efforts to reach a truce and hostage release agreement between Israel and Hamas have encountered multiple challenges, but recent negotiations have sparked hope for a resolution. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed optimism about achieving a ceasefire in Gaza, following a 'cautious optimism' statement from Washington about an 'imminent deal.' These hopes arise from reported indirect negotiations in Qatar, facilitated by Qatar, Egypt, and the United States. Diplomatic sources indicate that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's recent assertion for a deal before his January 20 inauguration has influenced the negotiations. Hamas, feeling isolated due to the weakening of its Lebanese ally Hezbollah and the fall of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, is eager to secure an agreement by year-end. This sentiment is echoed by the hope of many who view a deal as a 'perfect Christmas gift.' The death of Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar has shifted negotiation responsibilities to Hamas leaders abroad, known for their pragmatic approach. According to a high-ranking Hamas official, talks have reached the 'final details' stage, with an announcement expected from Qatar and Egypt once negotiations conclude. An Israeli government spokesman refrained from commenting on the proposed deal, suggesting that keeping details under wraps is beneficial. The proposed deal involves a ceasefire and a phased release of hostages. Initially, Israeli civilian hostages and female soldiers would be released in exchange for numerous Palestinian prisoners. Israel would also partially withdraw its forces from specific areas in Gaza, allowing displaced residents to return under Israeli army monitoring. Subsequent phases would involve the release of Israeli male soldiers, the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from most areas, and the start of reconstruction efforts in Gaza. The Rafah crossing on the Egyptian border would be jointly managed by the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, and the European Union. Despite the progress, significant obstacles remain. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has consistently opposed withdrawing Israeli troops from the Philadelphi Corridor, and Israel has stated it will not allow Hamas to govern Gaza post-war. Additionally, the governance of Gaza remains a contentious issue within the Palestinian leadership. While a Hamas official mentioned that international entities would guarantee the agreement's implementation, there has been no confirmation from these parties.The post Latest Updates on Gaza Ceasefire Talks first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/latest-updates-gaza-ceasefire-talks/	2024-12-19T10:09:56-08:00	
Aoun Only Serious Candidate for January Session	The Democratic Gathering bloc has become the first to officially declare its presidential candidate ahead of the election session set for January 9. This session may potentially conclude over two years of presidential vacancy. On Wednesday, following a meeting, the Democratic Gathering bloc announced that its MPs would vote for Army chief Gen. Joseph Aoun on January 9. Former Progressive Socialist Party leader Walid Jumblat, who attended the meeting, had previously met with Speaker Nabih Berri and tried to persuade him to support Aoun. However, these efforts, as well as attempts to convince Free Patriotic Movement leader Jebran Bassil, were unsuccessful. According to MTV, Berri's reservations about Aoun stem from his 'sharp' character and 'sectarian approach,' rather than his ties to the U.S. Joseph Aoun, considered a strong candidate for the presidency, faces the challenge of enforcing the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire, a task heavily dependent on his troops' deployment in the south. Despite difficulties, Aoun is seen as a figure of personal integrity and national dedication, respected for his leadership in driving out the Islamic State from the Syrian border region. He has led the army since 2017, with his mandate extended twice, and maintains good relations across the political spectrum, including with Hezbollah and foreign countries. Although various politicians and parties have suggested Aoun as a presidential candidate, only the Democratic Gathering bloc has officially endorsed him for the January 9 session. Opposition blocs have considered other candidates like Michel Mouawad, Jihad Azour, Salah Honein, Neemat Frem, and Nassif Hitti, with Azour being their latest official candidate. Hezbollah and Amal have consistently backed Suleiman Franjieh. The opposition remains undecided on its candidate for January 9. Meanwhile, Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea has been in contact with Berri and expressed his willingness to run for president if he gains enough support. Kataeb leader Sami Gemayel, who supports Aoun, has also indicated a potential vote for Geagea. In addition to Aoun, other potential candidates include ex-ambassador to the Vatican George Khoury, MP Farid Haykal al-Khazen, General Security chief Maj. Gen. Elias Bayssari, ex-minister Ziad Baroud, Jean-Louis Cardahi, and banker Samir Assaf, with varying support from different factions and countries. Despite accusations of inflexibility, Hezbollah and Amal, known as the Shiite Duo, have called for dialogue and a consensus president. Franjieh, still running for the presidency, expressed openness to any suitable candidate who can build the state, emphasizing the need for agreement with allies like Hezbollah.The post Aoun Only Serious Candidate for January Session first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/aoun-serious-candidate-january-session/	2024-12-19T10:09:46-08:00	
Report: Israel Refuses to Halt Violations or Withdraw	The five-party committee responsible for overseeing the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire held its second meeting on Wednesday. Sources informed al-Akhbar newspaper that the Israeli side did not provide a specific timeline for a complete withdrawal from southern Lebanon and did not commit to stopping ceasefire violations. Lebanese Army officers insisted on an initial withdrawal from certain areas, pointing out that over 20 days had passed since the agreement was implemented. However, the Israeli officers only noted the Lebanese demands without making any promises regarding immediate actions. Regarding the Lebanese delegation's complaints about ongoing territorial, naval, and aerial violations, the Israeli delegation stated that they would review these concerns, as reported by al-Akhbar.The post Report: Israel Refuses to Halt Violations or Withdraw first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-refuses-halt-violations-withdraw/	2024-12-19T10:09:38-08:00	
Netanyahu: ‘We Will Stay’ from Strategic Syrian Peak	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Israeli forces will maintain their position in a buffer zone along the Syrian border, which was seized following the removal of President Bashar al-Assad, until a new arrangement is established to secure Israel's safety. Netanyahu made the statement on Tuesday while visiting Mount Hermon, located inside Syria near the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights. This marked the first time an Israeli leader had visited this area. Netanyahu recalled visiting the mountaintop as a soldier 53 years ago, noting that the location's strategic importance for Israel had grown in light of recent developments. Israel captured the buffer zone, a demilitarized area of roughly 400 square kilometers, just days after Assad was ousted by rebels. This move has drawn criticism, with accusations that Israel is exploiting the instability in Syria to annex land and violate a 1974 ceasefire agreement. Netanyahu emphasized that Israeli forces would stay in the area until a new arrangement that ensures security is reached. Defense Minister Israel Katz, who accompanied Netanyahu, ordered the military to establish fortifications, preparing for a potentially prolonged presence. Katz described the summit as Israel’s 'eyes' for identifying threats in the region. The U.N. had established the buffer zone after the 1973 Middle East war, and a peacekeeping force had patrolled the area. A U.N. spokesperson condemned Israel's actions, asserting that the presence of Israeli troops in the zone violated the agreement and amounted to occupation. While no immediate response from the opposition group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) or other Arab states was reported, the situation has further complicated Israel's relations in the region. Meanwhile, as Syria navigates its post-Assad era, a U.N. official indicated that militant leaders are committed to expanding humanitarian aid efforts. Syrian authorities, led by the HTS, pledged to support aid delivery from neighboring countries. Germany and the U.S. have also engaged with these insurgent leaders, discussing Syria’s political transition and human rights protections. In other news, the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces proposed establishing a demilitarized zone in the Kurdish-majority town of Kobani in northern Syria. This proposal comes amid tensions with Turkey, which views Kurdish forces as terrorist groups. Furthermore, mass graves containing the bodies of over 30 Syrians, victims of Assad's regime, were uncovered in the village of Izraa, intensifying the ongoing humanitarian crisis. Families of the missing had hoped to find their loved ones alive, but instead discovered victims who had been tortured and killed under the regime. On the diplomatic front, Qatar reopened its embassy in Damascus, a significant move after severing ties with Assad's government 13 years ago. Other embassies, including those of France and Turkey, have also resumed diplomatic relations with Syria, signaling shifts in international stance following Assad’s removal.The post Netanyahu: ‘We Will Stay’ from Strategic Syrian Peak first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/netanyahu-we-stay-strategic-syrian-peak/	2024-12-18T10:44:25-08:00	
UN Council Urges ‘Inclusive, Syrian-Led’ Political Process	The UN Security Council has called for a Syrian-led political process following the removal of President Bashar al-Assad. In its first statement on the situation in Syria, the Council emphasized the need for an inclusive political process that should culminate in elections. It also stressed the importance of respecting Syria's sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity. The statement, released late on Tuesday, urged that Syrians be allowed to determine their own future through peaceful and democratic means, as outlined in a 2015 resolution that calls for a new constitution and U.N.-supervised elections. The UN will facilitate the process, supporting efforts by UN envoy Geir Pedersen. Although the statement did not mention the removal of Assad on December 8, which occurred after an operation led by the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, it reiterated ongoing support for the U.N. peacekeeping force monitoring the Israel-Syria border. The Security Council also urged adherence to the 1974 Disengagement Agreement, which established a demilitarized zone to reduce tensions. Furthermore, the statement underscored the importance of fighting terrorism in Syria, particularly preventing the resurgence of the Islamic State (IS), which once controlled large areas of Iraq and Syria before being driven out in 2019. The Council also called for Syria to uphold human rights and international humanitarian law, ensuring justice for victims and access to aid for those in need.The post UN Council Urges ‘Inclusive, Syrian-Led’ Political Process first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/un-urges-inclusive-syrian-led-process/	2024-12-18T10:44:09-08:00	
Israel Army: Settlers Crossed into Lebanon’s Maroun al-Ras in Dec...	A group of Israeli settlers briefly crossed into Lebanon before being removed by the military, according to reports on Wednesday. The settlers, part of the Uri Tzafon movement, which advocates for Israeli settlement in southern Lebanon, were photographed on Saturday with signs and tents inside Lebanese territory, while Israeli soldiers were present. Initially, the military denied the reports but later confirmed that civilians had crossed the border by a few meters and were promptly removed. The military described the incident as serious and stated that it is investigating the breach. It emphasized that any attempt to approach or cross the border without coordination poses risks and disrupts the operations of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) in the area. The Uri Tzafon group, which claims that the area around the Lebanese village of Maroun al-Ras is home to an ancient Hebrew settlement, had previously crossed the border in early December, setting up tents, planting trees, and establishing a memorial for an Israeli soldier killed in Lebanon in October. This incident follows similar breaches at the Gaza border since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023. The Israeli settler movement has been emboldened by the country's far-right government and is now focusing on expanding into southern Lebanon and northern Gaza.The post Israel Army: Settlers Crossed into Lebanon’s Maroun al-Ras in December first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/settlers-crossed-lebanons-maroun-al-ras-december/	2024-12-18T10:44:02-08:00	
Jumblat Seeks Berri’s Support for Army Chief Amid Presidential Ta...	Former Progressive Socialist Party leader Walid Jumblat has reportedly attempted to convince Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri to support the election of Army chief General Joseph Aoun as Lebanon's president. Jumblat met with Berri on Monday, expressing optimism about electing a president during the session scheduled for January 9. According to reports, after his meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron in France, Jumblat informed Berri that Western powers are inclined toward Aoun’s election, although Paris prefers figures like banker Samir Assaf or former minister Ziad Baroud. However, they would not oppose Aoun’s candidacy if consensus can be reached. Berri reportedly conditioned his support for Aoun on the candidate’s willingness to protect the 'resistance,' a reference to Hezbollah. However, Berri later clarified that he is not entirely opposed to Aoun’s election but wants to consult with Hezbollah before making a decision. On a different front, MP Farid Haykal al-Khazen, another presidential hopeful, met with Maronite Patriarch Beshara al-Rahi to discuss the presidential election. Al-Khazen has been working to bridge gaps between various political blocs to reach an agreement on a presidential candidate, emphasizing the importance of electing a president in the January 9 session to avoid further political vacuum. Maronite Patriarch al-Rahi also met with Free Patriotic Movement (FPM) MP George Atallah, as the FPM continues consultations to build consensus among different political parties. Lebanon currently has several candidates for the presidency, including Aoun, former ambassador to the Vatican and army intelligence chief Brigadier General George Khoury, MP Farid Haykal al-Khazen, General Security chief Major General Elias Bayssari, former ministers Ziad Baroud, Jean-Louis Cardahi, Jihad Azour, and others. Different political factions have expressed varying support for these candidates. The FPM, led by Jebran Bassil, backs Khoury, Bayssari, and Baroud, while Speaker Berri supports Khoury, Bayssari, and al-Khazen. The opposition bloc backs candidates like Aoun, Azour, and Hitti. Meanwhile, regional powers have also shown differing preferences. The U.S. and Saudi Arabia are reportedly backing Aoun, while France favors Assaf, Baroud, and Hitti. Qatar reportedly supports Bayssari. These countries, alongside Egypt, have been working to resolve the deadlock over Lebanon’s presidential election, as the country has been without a head of state for more than two years due to a standoff between pro- and anti-Hezbollah factions in parliament. Regarding the possibility of other candidates, Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea has expressed his willingness to run for president if he can secure enough political support. He also suggested that early parliamentary elections could help bring about a new phase in Lebanon’s political landscape. Kataeb leader Sami Gemayel, who supports Aoun, mentioned that he would not hesitate to vote for Geagea if he decides to run, though he also hinted at his own potential candidacy, stressing that the priority at present is to address Lebanon's crisis.The post Jumblat Seeks Berri’s Support for Army Chief Amid Presidential Talks first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/jumblat-berris-support-army-chief/	2024-12-18T10:43:52-08:00	
Mikati Meets Erdogan in Turkey	Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara on Wednesday to discuss recent developments in Syria and southern Lebanon. Mikati was accompanied by a delegation, including a representative from the Lebanese Army and Lebanon's ambassador to Turkey. During the meeting, Mikati reportedly planned to address the issue of land demarcation between Lebanon and Syria following the potential removal of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Additionally, according to sources from al-Joumhouria newspaper, Mikati intended to discuss the future of Syrian-Lebanese relations and the fate of Lebanese individuals who have been missing in Syrian prisons. The issue has gained attention since the release of a Lebanese man who had been missing for 40 years after being freed by Syrian rebels in Hama last week. This has sparked increased calls from Lebanese families for information about their relatives, who have been presumed detained in Syrian prisons since Lebanon’s civil war when Syrian forces were present in Lebanon. Mikati also planned to talk with Turkish officials about the situation in southern Lebanon, especially after a ceasefire agreement was reached at the end of November.The post Mikati Meets Erdogan in Turkey first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/mikati-meets-erdogan-turkey/	2024-12-18T10:43:44-08:00	
US Bombs Houthi Military Facility in Yemen’s Capital	The U.S. military announced on Tuesday that it carried out a bombing on a Houthi military facility in Yemen's capital, Sanaa. This latest strike is part of ongoing U.S.-led efforts targeting the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. According to Houthi media, the strike hit a section of the facility that includes the rebels' Defense Ministry. There have been no immediate reports of casualties from the attack. U.S. Central Command stated that the late Monday strike targeted a key command and control center used to coordinate Houthi operations, which include attacks on U.S. Navy and commercial ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Since October 2023, when the Israel-Hamas conflict began, the Houthis have launched multiple missile and drone attacks on merchant vessels. They have seized one vessel and sunk two, resulting in the deaths of four sailors. The Houthis claim to target ships connected to Israel, the U.S., or the U.K. in an effort to stop Israel’s actions in Gaza, although many of the ships attacked have no direct ties to the conflict, including those headed for Iran. The U.S. bombing took place shortly after the Houthis claimed to have launched a hypersonic missile at Israel. The missile triggered sirens across the Tel Aviv metropolitan area. The Israeli military reported intercepting the missile outside of Israel’s borders, though some debris from the intercepting missile fell onto a home in east Jerusalem.The post US Bombs Houthi Military Facility in Yemen’s Capital first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-bombs-houthi-facility-yemens-capital/	2024-12-17T05:37:33-08:00	
Bomb Kills Head of Russia’s Nuclear Defense Forces in Moscow	A bomb explosion near an apartment building in Moscow killed Lt. General Igor Kirillov, the head of Russia's nuclear and chemical defense forces, and his assistant early on Tuesday. According to Russia's Investigative Committee, the device was placed in a scooter and remotely detonated. The bomb's blast had the force of approximately 300 grams of TNT. Russian state news agency Tass reported that the explosion caused significant damage, including shattered windows and scorched brickwork. Authorities are treating the incident as a terrorist attack. Investigators and forensic teams are working at the scene to gather details about the crime. Kirillov, who was appointed to head Russia's nuclear defense forces in April 2017, had faced sanctions from several countries, including the U.K. and Canada, due to his involvement in the Ukraine conflict. The Ukrainian Security Services (SBU) had previously charged Kirillov on December 16 for allegedly using banned chemical weapons during Russia's military operations in Ukraine, which began in February 2022. The U.S. State Department had also reported the use of chloropicrin, a chemical weapon, against Ukrainian forces. The SBU has documented over 4,800 chemical weapon uses, particularly the K-1 combat grenades, since the war began. This bombing is part of a broader pattern of attacks against Russian officials. On December 9, an explosive device targeted Sergei Yevsyukov, the head of a prison in Donetsk, causing injuries and further highlighting the ongoing violence as Russia maintains control over parts of Ukraine.The post Bomb Kills Head of Russia’s Nuclear Defense Forces in Moscow first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/bomb-kills-head-russias-nuclear-defense-forces-moscow/	2024-12-17T05:37:24-08:00	
Israel and Hamas Move Closer to Ceasefire Deal	After months of stagnation, Israel and Hamas appear to be making progress toward a ceasefire to end their prolonged conflict, which has lasted for 14 months. Recently, key mediators from the U.S., Qatar, and Egypt have resumed talks, reporting increased willingness from both sides to reach an agreement. A significant development is Hamas's willingness to show more flexibility on the timing of an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, while Israel’s defense minister, Israel Katz, has expressed optimism, stating that a deal is closer than ever. Although critical details remain unresolved, there is a renewed sense of hope that had been absent for some time. This shift is attributed to several factors, including the heavy losses Hamas has suffered during the war, its growing isolation after Hezbollah’s ceasefire with Israel, and setbacks for Iran, which has been a key supporter of both Hamas and Hezbollah. Both the outgoing Biden administration and the incoming Trump administration in the U.S. have indicated a desire to finalize a deal before the inauguration of President Trump on January 20. According to Egyptian and Hamas officials, the ceasefire agreement would unfold in stages. The first phase would include a cessation of hostilities, the exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and a significant increase in humanitarian aid to Gaza. Israel asserts that Hamas is holding 100 hostages, with many believed to have died. The initial ceasefire phase would last between six and eight weeks. During this period, Hamas would release around 30 hostages, including several dual U.S.-Israeli citizens. In return, Israel would free hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including some serving long sentences for their involvement in violent attacks. The deal would also lead to a substantial increase in aid to Gaza, which has been devastated by the war. The territory has been facing a severe humanitarian crisis, with 90% of its 2.3 million residents displaced. The agreement would likely include the reopening of the Rafah crossing with Egypt, a critical passage for Palestinians seeking to leave Gaza, which has been closed since May due to the Israeli invasion. Mediators are exploring the possibility of resurrecting a 2005 agreement that allowed the Palestinian Authority to manage the Rafah crossing with European Union observers. This agreement collapsed in 2007 when Hamas took control of Gaza. As part of the first phase of the ceasefire, Israeli forces would begin withdrawing from some Palestinian population centers, allowing displaced Palestinians to return. However, Israeli troops would remain in certain areas, such as the strategic Philadelphi corridor along Gaza's border with Egypt. Negotiations would continue during the ceasefire to finalize a comprehensive agreement that would bring an end to the war, ensure a full Israeli withdrawal, and address the release of remaining hostages and bodies held by Hamas. Talks would also focus on the future governance of Gaza and the rebuilding process following the extensive destruction caused by the conflict.The post Israel and Hamas Move Closer to Ceasefire Deal first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-hamas-closer-ceasefire-deal/	2024-12-17T05:37:11-08:00	
Mikati: Israeli Violations to End Soon	Lebanese Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati pledged on Tuesday to put an end to Israel's violations of the ceasefire agreement. Israel has conducted frequent airstrikes, primarily targeting southern Lebanon, since the ceasefire began on November 27, resulting in 29 deaths and 27 injuries. Despite these breaches, the fragile truce remains largely intact, with Israel asserting its right to use force against any violations under the terms of its deal with Lebanon. Hezbollah MP Hassan Fadlallah criticized the Lebanese government's failure to address Israel's continued violations, urging more decisive action. Mikati responded by assuring that the violations would be halted soon, noting that Lebanon had 'turned the page on the war.' Recently, Israeli forces carried out a raid in a valley near al-Najjariyeh, south of Sidon, wounding three people. On Tuesday, the Israeli army destroyed houses and detonated explosives in the southern border towns of Yaroun, Kfarkila, and Naqoura, where Israeli troops remain stationed. As part of the ceasefire terms, Israel is required to withdraw its forces from Lebanon within 60 days. Meanwhile, Hezbollah must move its heavy weapons north of the Litani River to reduce tensions along the border.The post Mikati: Israeli Violations to End Soon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/mikati-israeli-violations-end-soon/	2024-12-17T05:36:47-08:00	
France Pledges Support for Syrians During Transition Amid Engagem...	A French diplomatic delegation visited the Syrian embassy in Damascus on Tuesday, marking the first such visit since Bashar al-Assad was ousted by Islamist-led rebels. French special envoy for Syria, Jean-Francois Guillaume, stated that France is preparing to support Syrians during their transition, hoping for a peaceful period ahead. The French flag was raised in the embassy for the first time since it was closed in 2012, signaling the significance of this visit. Guillaume emphasized that the delegation's goal was to establish contact with the de facto authorities in Damascus. Meanwhile, the European Commission's President, Ursula Von der Leyen, announced that the EU would increase direct engagement with Syria's new leadership. She stressed the importance of addressing the growing threat of the Islamic State's resurgence and underscored the necessity of continued dialogue with factions such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). Germany also took a step towards engaging with the new Syrian government. German diplomats held their first talks with the government installed by HTS, focusing on an inclusive transition process and the protection of minorities. Germany remains cautious, acknowledging HTS's origins in al-Qaida ideology but expressing a willingness to assess the group's actions moving forward. The country has been a primary destination for Syrian refugees in recent years. British diplomats also engaged with HTS leaders, including Ahmad al-Sharaa, during their visit to Damascus. The UK has not ruled out reconsidering its classification of HTS as a terrorist organization, but for now, officials continue to engage with the group. In a meeting with the West, al-Sharaa called for the lifting of sanctions and an end to Israeli airstrikes on Syria, highlighting the need for peace and stability in the region. The United Nations’ humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, also met with Syrian leaders, expressing cautious optimism about the potential for scaling up humanitarian support in the country. Fletcher, after meeting with HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, suggested that there is a foundation for increased aid, signaling a rare moment of hope amidst Syria’s prolonged crisis.The post France Pledges Support for Syrians During Transition Amid Engagement with New Rulers first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/france-support-syrians-transition/	2024-12-17T05:36:40-08:00

Syrian Rebel Force Deployed Near Damascus to Stop Looters	A rebel group was deployed to a village in southeastern Damascus to combat looters who had overrun a residential complex, stealing items and setting several apartments on fire. This action took place a week after the rebels launched a swift offensive on the Syrian capital, leading to the flight of President Bashar Assad and the end of his family's decades-long rule. The rebels' main focus has been securing the city of Damascus, where looting and attacks on government and security buildings have been limited. On Sunday, a group of rebels arrived in Husseiniyeh, a village where looters, including women and children, had raided a residential complex. They took furniture, food, copper wires, and other valuables. Residents described their homes being ransacked, with some even watching as looters set fires to the buildings and carried off what they could. One resident described the looting of his 25-year home and pointed out a child walking away with a box of metal cables. A local school principal reported that her home was looted but that she was unable to stop it. She criticized the rebels, but a fighter responded by promising to establish a checkpoint in the area to prevent further thefts, as many of the looters came from a nearby village. The looters resorted to firing grenades at the apartments, causing fires, while the rebels fired shots near the looters to disperse them and took action to apprehend some of the culprits. The rebels detained around a dozen looters, while others managed to flee, still carrying their stolen goods. No injuries were reported in the confrontation.The post Syrian Rebel Force Deployed Near Damascus to Stop Looters first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/syrian-rebel-force-deployed-damascus-stop-looters/	2024-12-16T10:44:31-08:00	
Israel to Close Embassy in Ireland Amid Gaza Tensions	Israel has decided to close its embassy in Dublin as tensions between Israel and Ireland have escalated, particularly due to Ireland's stance on the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Israel's Foreign Minister, Gideon Sa'ar, condemned Ireland's policies, describing them as 'extreme anti-Israel.' This move follows a series of diplomatic clashes, such as Ireland's recognition of Palestine as a state alongside countries like Spain and Norway earlier in the year. The situation further deteriorated when the Irish Cabinet decided to join South Africa in its case against Israel at the International Court of Justice, accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. While Israel strongly denies these accusations, Irish Foreign Minister Micheál Martin emphasized that such actions are unacceptable under international law. Despite the embassy closure, Ireland maintains that its policies are rooted in a commitment to human rights and peace, and it remains open to diplomatic dialogue. Prime Minister Simon Harris expressed regret over Israel's decision but firmly rejected the claim that Ireland is 'anti-Israel,' stating that the country stands for international law, peace, and human rights.The post Israel to Close Embassy in Ireland Amid Gaza Tensions first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-close-embassy-ireland-gaza-tensions/	2024-12-16T10:44:22-08:00	
Raad Asserts Syrian People’s Right to Self-Determination	Hezbollah's parliamentary bloc leader, MP Mohammad Raad, emphasized the critical importance of the Syrian people's right to self-determination. Raad pointed out that the regime change in Syria was not a spontaneous event but rather a consequence of a well-coordinated effort by regional and international powers aiming to alter the authority in the country. In his article for al-Akhbar newspaper, Raad acknowledged the significant presence of armed opposition factions in Syria. He underscored that the Syrian people have the legitimate right to decide their political future and stressed that any change should reflect the will of the entire Syrian population, encompassing all its components and formations. Raad also highlighted the essential unity of Syria, cautioning against any actions that might jeopardize it. He emphasized the necessity for political freedom to be aligned with national sovereignty and commitments. Additionally, Raad called on the Lebanese government to fulfill its responsibilities in protecting Lebanon through its institutions, including the Lebanese army and UNIFIL, while affirming that Hezbollah remains a critical defender of Lebanese sovereignty. This stance by Hezbollah underscores the broader regional implications of the Syrian conflict and the ongoing debate over self-determination and national sovereignty within the Middle Eastern geopolitical landscape. The recognition of the Syrian people's right to determine their own future remains a pivotal issue, influencing both regional stability and international relations.The post Raad Asserts Syrian People’s Right to Self-Determination first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/raad-syrian-peoples-right-self-determination/	2024-12-16T10:44:13-08:00	
Assad Denies Plans to Leave Syria, Labels New Leaders as Terroris...	Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has strongly denied any intentions of leaving Syria, labeling the emerging leadership as terrorists. In a recent statement, Assad dismissed rumors about his departure, asserting his commitment to remain in Syria despite the ongoing conflict and international pressure. He condemned the new leaders, branding them as terrorists who pose a threat to Syria’s stability. Assad's regime, which has faced substantial opposition and international criticism, continues to reject the legitimacy of the opposition forces, attributing their rise to foreign intervention and extremist ideologies. Assad’s government, backed by Russian and Iranian support, has been engaged in a protracted conflict with various rebel factions. The situation remains volatile, with Assad emphasizing his determination to fight what he perceives as terrorism to restore order and sovereignty in Syria. This declaration comes amidst growing international isolation and condemnation of Assad’s tactics, including alleged war crimes and humanitarian abuses during the civil war that has ravaged Syria for over a decade. The future of Syria remains uncertain as the conflict continues to evolve with complex regional and international dynamics.The post Assad Denies Plans to Leave Syria, Labels New Leaders as Terrorists first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/assad-denies-plans-leave-syria-leaders-terrorists/	2024-12-16T10:44:06-08:00	
MP Urges State to Protect Lebanon Without Hezbollah’s Help	Weeks after a U.S.-French brokered ceasefire was established, Israel continued to violate the agreement, prompting Hezbollah to accuse it of exploiting a 60-day withdrawal period. Hezbollah also criticized the Lebanese state's efforts to halt these violations as ineffective. According to the ceasefire terms, Israeli forces have 60 days to withdraw from Lebanon, while Hezbollah must relocate its heavy weaponry north of the Litani River. Hezbollah MP Hassan Fadlallah commented on Monday that although there are efforts to stop Israel's violations, they have not been successful. Israel maintains that the ceasefire agreement permits it to use military force against perceived violations. Since the ceasefire began on November 27, Israeli strikes, primarily in southern Lebanon, have resulted in at least 29 deaths and 27 injuries. Despite this, the fragile truce seems to be holding. Fadlallah mentioned that Hezbollah is coordinating with the Lebanese government, urging it to fulfill its responsibilities and protect Lebanon through its institutions, the Lebanese army, the UNIFIL, and the monitoring committee. The U.S.-led committee monitoring the ceasefire includes representatives from France, the U.N. peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon (UNIFIL), Lebanon, and Israel. Fadlallah emphasized that Hezbollah's resistance is crucial for protection but acknowledged that the state now has an opportunity to demonstrate its capability to defend Lebanon without relying on Hezbollah. He challenged the state to prove itself. On Monday, an Israeli raid on a valley near al-Najjariyeh, south of Sidon, injured three people. Since the ceasefire, Israel has conducted at least three airstrikes in the Sidon district, claiming to target Hezbollah rockets and movements.The post MP Urges State to Protect Lebanon Without Hezbollah’s Help first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/mp-state-protect-lebanon-without-hezbollahs-help/	2024-12-16T10:43:56-08:00

US in Contact with New Rulers of Syria	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed on Saturday that American officials have had direct communication with the terrorist-designated rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which played a leading role in the ousting of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Blinken, speaking at a press conference in Jordan, was the first U.S. official to publicly acknowledge these contacts between the Biden administration and HTS, a group that led a coalition of opposition forces responsible for driving Assad from power and forcing him into exile in Russia last weekend. Blinken, alongside counterparts from eight Arab nations, Turkey, and senior officials from the European Union and United Nations, endorsed a set of principles to guide Syria's transition toward a peaceful, inclusive, and nonsectarian country. While Blinken did not provide details of the discussions with HTS, he emphasized the importance of delivering messages to the group about its future conduct and governance during the transitional period. In Aqaba, Blinken stated that the U.S. had been in contact with HTS and other parties, and reassured the Syrian people that the U.S. supports their success and is prepared to help. HTS, which was previously affiliated with al-Qaida, has been designated a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department since 2018, leading to severe sanctions, including a ban on providing material support to the group. However, U.S. officials are not prohibited from communicating with designated groups. In a separate interview on Syrian television, HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, did not comment directly on the contacts with the U.S. but acknowledged that the new authorities in Syria were in communication with Western embassies. He also stated that HTS did not intend to engage in further conflict, citing the exhaustion of Syria's population. HTS has been working to stabilize security and initiate a political transition after seizing control of Damascus. It has attempted to reassure the public, which remains shaken by Assad's fall and concerned about the presence of extremist elements among the rebels. The group's leaders have stated their commitment to distancing themselves from their extremist past. Blinken also highlighted the continued importance of defeating the Islamic State group, noting that U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters, part of the Syrian Democratic Forces, have played a critical role in driving ISIS out of large parts of Syria. He emphasized the need for these forces to maintain their position, especially during this unstable period when ISIS may attempt to regroup. A joint statement from the foreign ministers meeting in Jordan urged all parties to stop hostilities in Syria and voiced support for a locally led political transition. The statement also called for preventing the resurgence of extremist groups and ensuring the secure and safe destruction of Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles. Jordan’s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, expressed concerns about Syria falling into chaos. Additionally, Arab foreign ministers issued a statement calling for U.N.-supervised elections based on a new constitution approved by the Syrian people, while condemning Israel's recent actions in the region. U.S. officials have noted that al-Sharaa has made positive statements about protecting the rights of minorities and women, but they remain skeptical about his long-term commitment to these goals. In other developments, Syrian rebels and the unarmed opposition worked with U.S. officials to facilitate the release of an American man who had been detained by Assad's government. U.S. officials also continue their search for Austin Tice, an American journalist who has been missing near Damascus for 12 years. Blinken stressed the importance of continued efforts to locate Tice and bring him home.The post US in Contact with New Rulers of Syria first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-contact-new-rulers-syria/	2024-12-15T09:04:07-08:00	
Germany Warns Assad Supporters Fleeing Atrocities Won’t Be Welcom...	Germany's foreign minister has issued a strong warning to anyone involved in atrocities under the regime of ousted Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, stating that they will face legal consequences if they attempt to seek refuge in Germany. The country has been a major destination for Syrian refugees over the past decade, with several hundred thousand Syrians currently living there. In recent years, Germany has convicted former Syrian secret police officers for their roles in the abuse of detainees. Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock made it clear that those who were complicit in the Syrian regime's crimes will be held accountable. She emphasized that Germany would take legal action against anyone involved in torturing detainees under Assad's rule, stating that the country would use 'the full force of the law' to ensure justice. Baerbock also called for closer cooperation between international security agencies and intelligence services to prevent perpetrators from fleeing. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser assured that Germany is 'extremely vigilant' in monitoring its borders and has implemented measures to reduce irregular migration. She reiterated that no one involved in atrocities would be safe from prosecution in Germany. Faeser pointed to previous convictions as proof of Germany's commitment to pursuing justice in such cases. While Germany has emphasized its commitment to prosecuting war crimes, it has also reassured well-integrated refugees that they are welcome to stay. Chancellor Olaf Scholz addressed concerns about the return of Syrians to their homeland, acknowledging that many refugees hope to return once conditions allow. However, he stressed that the future of Syria under Assad's absence remains uncertain, and only time will reveal the country's direction.The post Germany Warns Assad Supporters Fleeing Atrocities Won’t Be Welcome first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/germany-assad-supporters-fleeing-wont-be-welcome/	2024-12-15T07:53:15-08:00	
Mikati Urges Syrians to Return Home	Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati has urged Syrians who sought refuge in Lebanon to return home following the fall of President Bashar al-Assad. Mikati highlighted that Lebanon, with a population of 5.8 million, is currently hosting around two million Syrians, with over 800,000 registered with the United Nations. This makes Lebanon the country with the highest number of refugees per capita. At a political event in Rome on Saturday, Mikati explained that the influx of refugees has placed immense strain on Lebanon's already struggling economy, intensifying competition for jobs and services. He noted that one-third of Lebanon’s population now consists of Syrian refugees, further complicating the nation’s economic challenges. Mikati emphasized that the best solution to the refugee crisis, in light of the recent political changes in Syria, is for Syrians to return to their homeland. He also called on the international community, particularly Europe, to assist in this process. He suggested that recovery efforts should be initiated in secure areas of Syria to facilitate the return of refugees.The post Mikati Urges Syrians to Return Home first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/mikati-urges-syrians-return-home/	2024-12-15T07:53:08-08:00	
UN Envoy Urges Sanctions Relief After Assad’s Fall	The United Nations Special Envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, urged for the swift removal of Western sanctions following the removal of President Bashar Assad. For years, the Syrian government has been subjected to strict sanctions from the United States, European Union, and other nations, due to Assad's violent crackdown on what initially began as peaceful protests in 2011, eventually escalating into a brutal civil war. The conflict has resulted in nearly half a million deaths and displaced half of Syria’s pre-war population of 23 million. Efforts to rebuild have been heavily hindered by sanctions, which aimed to block reconstruction in government-controlled regions until a political solution could be reached. During his visit to Damascus, Pedersen expressed hope for an end to the sanctions to allow for the rebuilding of Syria. He met with officials from the interim government formed by the opposition forces, led by the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which played a central role in ousting Assad. Although HTS is recognized as a terrorist organization by the U.S., which may complicate reconstruction efforts, the Biden administration has hinted at the possibility of removing this designation. The interim government, expected to oversee the country until March, has yet to clarify how it plans to transition to a permanent administration. Pedersen emphasized the need for an inclusive political process led by Syrians themselves. He also stressed the importance of justice and accountability for crimes committed during the conflict, and called on the international community to increase humanitarian aid.The post UN Envoy Urges Sanctions Relief After Assad’s Fall first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/un-envoy-urges-sanctions-relief-assads-fall/	2024-12-15T07:53:00-08:00	
One Week Into New Syria: Rebels Seek Normalcy, Syrians Refuse Sil...	At Damascus International Airport, the new head of security, a former rebel who had marched across Syria to the capital, arrived with his team. The few maintenance workers who reported to work gathered around Maj Hamza al-Ahmed, eager to learn about the changes ahead. They quickly shared grievances that had been silenced during President Bashar Assad’s rule, which now, surprisingly, had come to an end. The workers spoke about being denied promotions and benefits in favor of Assad loyalists and being threatened with imprisonment for slow work. They also expressed concerns about hardcore Assad supporters among the airport staff, who might return once the facility reopens. As al-Ahmed tried to reassure them, engineer Osama Najm commented, 'This is the first time we talk.' This was a pivotal week for Syria following Assad’s unexpected downfall. Rebels, now in charge, encountered a population filled with mixed emotions—excitement for newfound freedoms, grief over years of oppression, and uncertainty about the future. Some were so overwhelmed by the changes that they were brought to tears. Surprisingly, the transition has been smooth. There have been few reports of reprisals, sectarian violence, or revenge killings. Looting and destruction were quickly controlled, and insurgent fighters have been disciplined. In the capital, Damascus, life went on as usual, with only a single van of fighters spotted. Yet, there are numerous challenges ahead. Syria is broken, isolated after five decades of Assad rule. Families have been torn apart by war, former prisoners suffer from trauma, and tens of thousands of detainees remain unaccounted for. The economy is in shambles, poverty is widespread, and corruption is rampant. Despite these issues, many are eager to chart a new path forward. At the airport, al-Ahmed told the staff, 'The new path will have challenges, but Syria is for all, and we must cooperate.' Najm, an engineer, acknowledged the rebels' positive rhetoric but warned, 'We will not stay silent about anything wrong again.' Meanwhile, in a police station that had been burned down, Assad’s pictures were torn down, and files destroyed after insurgents entered the city on December 8. All Assad-era police and security personnel had disappeared. By Saturday, the station was being managed by ten men from the police force of the rebels' de facto 'salvation government,' which had previously governed Idlib in Syria's northwest. These rebel policemen, now tasked with overseeing the station, dealt with petty thefts and street disputes. One woman complained about neighbors sabotaging her power supply, and a policeman informed her that courts would soon begin operating again, though it would take time. The rebels have tried to bring order to Damascus by replicating the system they had in Idlib. However, scaling this structure is a challenge. There are only about 4,000 rebel policemen, with half of them stationed in Idlib and the rest tasked with maintaining security in Damascus and other areas. Some experts estimate the total number of insurgents at around 20,000. The fighters and civilians are still learning about each other. Many insurgents drive expensive SUVs and carry Turkish lira, an unofficial currency in government-controlled areas. Most of the fighters come from conservative, rural areas and some are hardline Islamists. The main rebel group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, has distanced itself from its al-Qaeda past, but some fighters still wear Islamist slogans on their uniforms, and not all insurgents belong to HTS. Many Syrians remain wary of the new forces, with some, like Hani Zia from Daraa, concerned about the potential for attacks on minorities and revenge killings. Zia fears that some fighters may feel superior due to their years of fighting. Despite these fears, life in Damascus has not been marked by widespread fear. Many people feel a newfound sense of freedom and refuse to be oppressed any longer. Some restaurants have resumed serving alcohol, while others do so more discreetly. At a café in the Christian quarter of the Old City, men were drinking beer when a fighter patrol passed by, but the fighters did nothing. Salem Hajjo, a theater teacher who had participated in the 2011 protests, expressed that although he disagreed with the rebels' Islamist views, he admired their ability to manage their affairs and expected to have a voice in Syria’s future. 'We have never been this at ease,' he said. 'The fear is gone. The rest is up to us.' In the aftermath of Assad’s fall, celebratory gunfire echoed through the streets. Some security agency buildings were set on fire, and the airport's duty-free was looted. The rebels blamed fleeing Assad loyalists for much of the chaos. The public stayed indoors, watching from a distance as the insurgents imposed order. A three-day curfew was announced, and fighters were deployed to protect properties. After a day, people began to venture out, with many heading to the prisons, particularly Saydnaya, to search for loved ones who had been missing for years. Though few found any trace of the missing, it was a unifying experience. Rebels searching for their own lost relatives mingled with families of the missing, all in the same grim halls. During the street celebrations, insurgents invited children to climb onto their armored vehicles, posed for photos with women, and played revolutionary songs. Posters of activists killed by Assad’s regime began appearing everywhere, and the state-controlled TV stations swiftly switched from praising Assad to airing revolutionary songs and declarations from the new insurgent-led government. The new administration has called on people to return to work and urged Syrian refugees to come back to help rebuild the country. Plans for rehabilitating the security forces have been announced to prevent the return of individuals with blood on their hands. Rebel leaders assured airport staff, many of whom had been loyal to Assad, that their homes would not be attacked. Despite the hopeful atmosphere, Syria still faces many unresolved issues. Although produce prices have fallen after Assad’s departure, fuel distribution has been disrupted, leading to high transportation costs and widespread blackouts. Officials are working to reopen the airport soon. This week, maintenance crews inspected planes on the tarmac, and cleaners began clearing away trash and broken furniture. One cleaner, Murad, shared that he earned the equivalent of $15 a month and had six children to care for, one of whom is disabled. He dreams of owning a mobile phone but knows it will take time to clean up the airport. 'We need a long time to clean this up,' he said.The post One Week Into New Syria: Rebels Seek Normalcy, Syrians Refuse Silence first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/one-week-new-syria-rebels-normalcy-syrians-refuse-silence/	2024-12-15T07:52:52-08:00
