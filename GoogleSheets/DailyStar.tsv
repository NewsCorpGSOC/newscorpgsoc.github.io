Ceasefire extended to Feb. 18 as Hezbollah captive talks set to b...	The White House, in a statement dated January 26, said the ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon would be extended until February 18, 2025. There are also continuing negotiations with regard to Lebanese prisoners held by Israel since October 7, 2023. A United States-brokered truce in November 2024 had established the original ceasefire agreement to bring an end to the hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah. It called for the immediate 60-day withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon and the pullback of Hezbollah north of the Litani River. But as the first deadline drew near, the border grew more tense. On January 26, Israeli troops allegedly fired on Lebanese civilians trying to return to their homes in the south, killing at least 22 people and wounding many others. Israel blamed the incomplete deployment of the Lebanese army in southern areas as one of the main reasons for its delay in pulling out. The Israeli government is concerned that Hezbollah may regain access to those areas if the Lebanese military does not take full control. The Lebanese army has responded by saying it cannot deploy properly before the Israeli forces leave the region. Captive Deal to Be Discussed in Coming Weeks Along with the extension of the ceasefire, an agreement has been reached between the governments of Lebanon, Israel, and the United States to begin talks on the return of Lebanese prisoners captured after October 7, 2023. This is regarded by many as one step closer towards humanitarian needs and confidence-building between the parties. Although the extension of the ceasefire does, for the time being, prevent active conflict, the situation remains precarious. The international community remains attentive to reports of compliance with the terms of the ceasefire and developments in follow-up negotiations. Full implementation of these agreements is important for consolidating long-term stability in the area and providing the necessary guarantees for the voluntary return of displaced persons to their homes. The strike of the extension of the ceasefire to February 18, initiated with captive negotiations, is a cautious yet hopeful step toward peace between Israel and Lebanon. Continued diplomatic efforts and mutual cooperation will be required to navigate through the intricacies of the conflict in order for it to reach a lasting resolution.The post Ceasefire extended to Feb. 18 as Hezbollah captive talks set to begin first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/ceasefire-extended-feb-18-hezbollah-talks-begin/	2025-01-27T04:37:09-08:00	
Tens of thousands return to ravaged northern Gaza as Israel lifts...	Tens of thousands of Palestinians have begun returning home in northern Gaza, as Israel for the first time in 15 months lifted its closure of the area. Israel and Hamas are taking new steps to wind down a protracted conflict and facilitate the release of hostages under a fragile ceasefire sealing their weekend agreement. On Monday morning, teeming masses of Palestinians, carrying their belongings, poured through the Netzarim corridor into northern Gaza. It was a powerful reverse image of the mass exodus at the start of the war last October 2023. Many had been huddled in squalid conditions in tent camps and repurposed schools in the south, anxious for the green light to go home. But the euphoria of return has also meant coming to terms with the enormity of the destruction: tons of homes and infrastructure badly wrecked or reduced to rubble in heavy fighting. Yasmin Abu Amshah, a mother of three, walked nearly four miles to reach her home in Gaza City-only to find it still standing but damaged. She also was reunited with her younger sister for the first time in over a year and said the return was a happy one, despite the long journey. Ceasefire and Hostage Releases A ceasefire agreement with the release of hostages has helped the residents to return. Hamas has agreed to free several Israeli hostages, including civilians and soldiers, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The deal allows the return of displaced Palestinians to northern Gaza. This ceasefire, starting from January 19, 2025, aims to end the deadliest and most destructive war between Israel and Hamas. The ceasefire has brought a glimmer of hope in this never-ending saga, though the situation remains fragile. The international community is closely monitoring adherence to the terms of the ceasefire and the ongoing humanitarian efforts in the region. The return of residents into northern Gaza is a major step back toward normalcy, though rebuilding and recovery will take a long time and substantial support. The lifting of the closure in northern Gaza under the ceasefire agreement finally saw tens of thousands of Palestinians being able to head home. Every corner seemed to exude resilience and determination to begin this hard way of rebuilding among residents who practically saw everything torn to bits.The post Tens of thousands return to ravaged northern Gaza as Israel lifts closure under truce first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/tens-thousands-return-gaza-israel-lifts-closure/	2025-01-27T04:36:58-08:00	
Lebanese citizens make renewed push to return to southern border ...	People from South Lebanon escorted by the Lebanese army attempted to return to their villages on Monday, according to official reports and AFP correspondents, one day after Israeli fire killed 24 people in the region on Sunday. Reports said at least five people were wounded by Israeli fire on Monday in the areas of Houla and Bani Hayyan. Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati announced that Lebanon agreed to extend a ceasefire agreement between the militant Hezbollah organization and Israel until February 18. The extension came after the Israeli military failed to meet the deadline for withdrawal set for Sunday. Dozens of vehicles loaded with families were seen heading toward border towns Monday, a day after earlier attempts by residents to return to their homes in south Lebanon proved unsuccessful. In the village of Burj al-Moulouk, dozens of men, women, and children gathered behind a dirt barrier, some waving Hezbollah flags, as they hoped to reach the border town of Kfar Kila, where Israeli forces remain stationed. Sweets, water and pictures of Hezbollah's former leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, killed in an Israeli strike last month, were handed out by the party's backers to passers-by in Bint Jbeil, a major access point for border villages. Others passed out stickers emblazoned with phrases extolling what they described as a 'victory from God.' Women proudly carried around pictures of fallen Hezbollah fighters. The National News Agency said Lebanese army reinforcements reached the outskirts of the border town of Mays al-Jabal, where residents had started to congregate at the entrance to the town, ready to venture in alongside the military. It also said Israeli forces opened fire in the direction of Lebanese army troops near the town, without any casualties. In Houla, residents went inside after the army deployed in several neighbourhoods. The truce, which came into effect on 27 November, called for the Lebanese army to take up positions in the south alongside UN peacekeepers as the Israeli army withdrew completely within a 60-day period. That deadline expired on Sunday without the task being completed, with both sides accusing each other of holding up the implementation of the agreement. The ceasefire ended more than a year of hostilities, including two months of heavy fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. Earlier in the day, the Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee reiterated the calls on residents of South Lebanon to postpone their return. The Lebanese Army meanwhile said it would continue accompanying residents heading back and 'protecting' them against the anticipated Israeli attacks. Lebanon's health ministry said on Sunday Israeli forces opened fire on civilians trying to return to their villages, killing 24, including one soldier. The Israeli military countered that its troops fired warning shots to thwart what it saw as threats when some people appeared to be heading towards their positions.The post Lebanese citizens make renewed push to return to southern border villages first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lebanese-push-return-southern-border-villages/	2025-01-27T04:36:46-08:00	
US halts most aid, spares Israel and Egypt arms	The United States announced it was freezing most of its international aid programs with a policy change to exempt such recipients as military aid for stalwart allies including, amongst others, Israel and Egypt, in what the administration defined as an exercise of reorientation in America's priorities in foreign spending towards closer compatibility with its strategic interests. This shift in policy represents a watershed in U.S. foreign aid, with debate on what might be called a partial explanation for retaining aid for some countries while trying to rein it in for others. Israel and Egypt are exempt because they have long been viewed as vital to U.S. interests in the Middle East, having signed peace treaties with Israel. These countries receive immense military aid every year, with Israel receiving $3.8 billion on a 10-year memorandum of understanding and Egypt receiving $1.3 billion in military aid to help its counterterrorism efforts and maintain regional stability. The move by the U.S. government underlines its focus on preserving alliances with key partners in unstable regions. Israel is a critical player in the Middle East, with high-level intelligence-sharing and a linchpin for overall U.S. defenses in the region. Egypt has geopolitical significance because of its control of the Suez Canal and efforts to combat extremist groups across North Africa and the Sinai Peninsula. Although aid for these countries continued, the cutting of these other international aid programs was another movement of fiscal prudence and a rethinking of global commitments. The move attracted the ire of advocacy groups and diplomats who feel cutting off aid to developing nations will lead to humanitarian crises and lesser U.S. influence worldwide. This decision to focus on military aid, while cutting the other forms of assistance, has not gone unchallenged. Critics have questioned the long-term implications of abandoning humanitarian and economic development aid in less stable parts of the world. The cuts, they warn, may create vacuums that allow hostile powers like China and Russia to extend their influence. As the U.S. rebalances its foreign aid strategy, it continues to grapple with the hurdle of weighing national security interests against the role of global leadership by humanitarian means. The next few months will show how this shift affects America's relationships on the world stage and the stability of regions dependent upon U.S. support.The post US halts most aid, spares Israel and Egypt arms first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-halts-aid-spares-israel-egypt-arms/	2025-01-25T07:39:08-08:00	
Trump administration seeks extension for Israel’s Lebanon troop w...	In a new twist, the Trump administration has backed a temporary extension of the Israeli military sojourn in south Lebanon beyond the agreed-on 60-day withdrawal. This is in line with an earlier declaration by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that his country would not be able to meet the initial deadline since Lebanon was yet to fulfill the ceasefire terms. Background of the Ceasefire Agreement The truce, negotiated by the United States and France, went into effect on Nov. 27, 2024, with the stated goal of ending long hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah. Its major elements were the retreat of Hezbollah fighters north of the Litani River and the deployment of the Lebanese Army, backed by UN peacekeepers, to southern Lebanon. Israel was supposed to complete its troop pullout by late January 2025. Prime Minister Netanyahu has cited incomplete fulfillment by Lebanon of its obligations under the ceasefire as the main reason for the delay in withdrawal. He made it clear that the withdrawal of Israeli forces is conditioned on the complete and effective deployment of the Lebanese Army in the south, as well as the full withdrawal of Hezbollah forces beyond the Litani River. The Trump administration supports this extension, citing that Lebanese forces need to fully implement the agreement and protect Israeli citizens. A National Security Council spokesperson said that a brief, temporary extension would give the Lebanese government more time to uphold its obligations beneath the conditions of the ceasefire. Reactions are divided on the proposal for an extension. Hezbollah immediately rejected the idea, saying it would be a breach of Lebanese sovereignty and could lead to renewed fighting. But some international observers see a temporary extension as the means to ensure a smoother transition without creating a vacuum in south Lebanon. The situation remains fluid, with diplomatic efforts ongoing to balance the enforcement of ceasefire terms and the maintenance of regional stability. The international community is continuing to monitor developments closely, emphasizing that adherence to agreed-upon frameworks is important for lasting peace in the region.The post Trump administration seeks extension for Israel’s Lebanon troop withdrawal first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/trump-extension-israels-lebanon-troop-withdrawal/	2025-01-25T07:38:59-08:00	
Hamas announces release of four Israeli hostages tomorrow	Hamas has announced it will release four hostages from Israel tomorrow amid their ongoing negotiations, in a major step for the developing situation between Israel and the militant group based in the Gaza Strip. The announcement was made amidst a high-tension atmosphere in the region, along with sustained international pressure to take more humanitarian steps forward. The release is reportedly part of a broader agreement mediated by international mediators. While the details of the agreement remain undisclosed, this move is seen as de-escalation and an effort to make way for further dialogue. According to sources close to the matter, the names of hostages have already been communicated to Israeli officials and their families, bringing hope to those awaiting the return of their loved ones. A Step Toward Progress The announcement comes after weeks of frenetic negotiations between regional and international players. Qatar and Egypt are believed to have played pivotal roles in facilitating the agreement, leveraging their influence to mediate between the parties. These negotiations have also focused on securing humanitarian aid and addressing broader ceasefire conditions. While this news is a relief for the hostages' families, it also points to how intricate the conflict that continues on is. The release of hostages is often one of those emotional moments that bring into perspective the human cost of such prolonged disputes. Many hope this gesture will form the base upon which future agreements will be made to reduce violence and bring stability. Broader Consequences This move has received mixed reactions around the world, as, while others view it as a positive step toward peace, some restrain themselves, citing how fragile similar agreements have been in the past. The international community still calls for wider measures that will help bring about the necessary humanitarian response and find a sustainable solution to the conflict. With the release slated, all eyes now shift to the successful implementation of the release. Security is expected to be tightened as both sides would like to avoid any disruptions that may see the agreement derailed. Their release is a reminder of the complexity surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As much as this is a moment that should give some hope, it has brought to the fore the difficulties ahead in achieving lasting peace and security for all parties concerned.The post Hamas announces release of four Israeli hostages tomorrow first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hamas-release-four-israeli-hostages-tomorrow/	2025-01-24T09:11:43-08:00	
Netanyahu confirms Israel’s extended stay in Lebanon beyond 60 da...	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israeli forces will be in Lebanon longer than previously mentioned or a 60-day withdrawal. This is against the background of a continuing tense atmosphere in the region, with many questions being left to Israel's strategy in the long term and implications on regional stability. The first 60-day withdrawal plan was part of a ceasefire agreement in the hope of cooling off hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah. However, Netanyahu declared that operational complications and valid security apprehensions make the presence in Lebanon longer than initially announced. The prime minister reiterated that the security of every Israeli citizen and prevention of any threat to the people in future remains his priority. While the ceasefire agreement called for the Lebanese Army and UN peacekeepers to take over southern Lebanon, replacing Israeli forces there, the move reflects some suspicion that those forces are not yet ready or able to hold back Hezbollah activities. This was met with mixed reactions across the region. Lebanese officials seemed irritatingly puzzled by the now-extended military presence, which has been called a violation of sovereignty. Hezbollah has, however, condemned the move, terming it an act of aggression, and promising resistance in return. The international community, through the UN and key mediators in the deal to cease fire, all warned against violence, as many called on all sides to adhere to what had been agreed upon and to avoid further escalation. The longer stay reflects the complexities of the Israeli-Lebanese conflict. At the center of Israel's concern is the military build-up of Hezbollah. The influence of this group in southern Lebanon poses a real challenge to the fragile peace in that region. The extended mission is, therefore, to ensure Hezbollah does not get an opportunity to regroup for future attacks, according to Israel. Critics maintain that the presence may increase tension and make diplomatic efforts even more complicated. Events unfolding, both Israeli forces and regional players are watched on what comes next. The next weeks will be critical, which could either lead to further conflict or provide an opening for renewed negotiations due to the extended stay. This development underlines the urgent need for a sustainable resolution of the Israeli-Lebanese tensions, ensuring peace and security for all sides involved.The post Netanyahu confirms Israel’s extended stay in Lebanon beyond 60 days first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/netanyahu-israels-extended-stay-lebanon-60-days/	2025-01-24T09:11:06-08:00	
Hundreds flee Jenin camp after Israeli evacuation order	In recent development, the refugee camp of Jenin in the occupied West Bank has become a focal point of the big Israeli military operation. The offense has killed at least 12 Palestinians and injured more than 40, according to the Palestinian health ministry. Hundreds of residents have fled their homes in search of safety from the violence. Israeli Military actions in Jenin The Israeli Defense Forces have increased operations in Jenin with drone strikes and ground raids against what they designate as strongholds of militants. It is one of the largest military operations to have taken place in this area in recent times. This move by the IDF is part of an overall strategy aimed at breaking the militant networks operating within the West Bank, especially within areas like Jenin that have been pointed out as hotbeds for militant activities. The exacerbation has an impact on many aspects of life. The blockage of roads and military barricades has barred the Palestinian Red Crescent from gaining access to people injured during raids, while up to 600 individuals are trapped inside the main government hospital in Jenin as supplies dwindle and have very limited ways to access various vital services. The situation has prompted hundreds of residents to evacuate the Jenin refugee camp, seeking refuge in safer areas. While some reports indicate that Israeli forces issued evacuation orders, Israeli officials have denied mandating such evacuations, suggesting that residents chose to leave to avoid being caught in the crossfire. The heightened military activities in Jenin have been responded to by regional actors and international organizations. Jordan's foreign minister has warned that the situation in the West Bank may 'explode,' emphasizing that a comprehensive resolution of Palestinian issues must be found. Meanwhile, the United Nations has expressed its concern about Israel's expanding military operations, citing the risk of increased instability in the region. What happened in Jenin-as it still is-portrays the frailty of peace and security in the West Bank. Such military operations bear high humanitarian costs in the light of a civilian population always on the receiving end. As much as events are being watched by the international community in Jenin, there is an urgent call for dialogue and diplomatic efforts towards engaging in further de-escalation with a view to attend to the roots of such conflict.The post Hundreds flee Jenin camp after Israeli evacuation order first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hundreds-flee-jenin-israeli-evacuation-order/	2025-01-23T09:59:14-08:00	
Saudi crown prince pledges $600 billion US investment to Trump	In a deal that marked the depth of economic relations between Saudi Arabia and the US, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia announced an investment commitment of $600 billion to revamp strategic sectors across the United States. He reportedly made this commitment in a discussion with former US President Donald Trump, showing a bold vision for strengthening the ties of bilateral relations and the expansion of mutual economic interests. Key areas include energy, technology, infrastructure, and manufacturing-all reflecting the shared priorities of fostering economic growth and innovation. The investment plan also aligns with Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 initiative, a drive to diversify the Kingdom's economy and reduce dependence on oil. The United States will, in turn, likely experience an upsurge in job creation, modernization of infrastructure, and expanded technological advancement because of the injection of Saudi Arabian capital. This announcement, coming at a time when the uncertainty in the global economy needs international cooperation to be fostered, goes to show just how serious this Saudi Crown Prince is to position Saudi Arabia as a major global investment player. The decision signifies a continued partnership with the US despite changing political landscapes. Trump, who has made economic growth and private sector development the centerpiece of his presidency, praised the pledge in a statement, saying it was proof of the 'strong relationship' between the two countries and that it would create 'tremendous opportunities' for US-based companies to partner on major projects in Saudi Arabia. With this pledge, so much potential exists, but also many questions on how the money will be apportioned and how the timeline for implementation is going to work out. Observers will be closely monitoring the partnership's impact on both economies and how it aligns with broader geopolitical strategies. This will be a milestone investment that will represent a lasting relationship between Saudi Arabia and the United States, and a new era of cooperation and shared prosperity in years to come. And as more information emerges, the world will watch to see what this ambitious initiative does to shape the global economy.The post Saudi crown prince pledges $600 billion US investment to Trump first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/saudi-crown-prince-600-billion-investment-trump/	2025-01-23T09:59:06-08:00	
6 dead, 35 injured as Israel launches major West Bank operation	A major Israeli military operation in the West Bank has killed six people and injured 35 others, local health officials said. The flare-up constitutes one of the most violent military operations in the region in recent months and adds to growing tensions between Israeli forces and Palestinian locals. The operation, targeting the suspected militant strongholds in the hotbeds of the West Bank, saw the deployment of heavy contingents comprising Israeli forces with support from both land and air. According to the military sources in Israel, the mission had aimed at dissipating what they referred to as an imminent threat at the hands of the militant factions. Various arrests were said to be carried out in the operation where authorities claimed they had spotted caches of weapons and explosive devices. The affected areas' eyewitnesses told about scenes of chaos when heavy gunfire and explosions echoed across residential areas. Locals were compelled to flee from their homes as the medical teams fought against the clock to attend to the casualties. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society has documented a number of injuries with live ammunition and shrapnel. This operation is part of the escalation of violence in the West Bank, where visible violence has been rising over the last weeks. The streak of clashes that includes retaliation attacks from both sides makes the threat of further instability even higher. Israeli authorities once more vowed to maintain security within the borders of Israel, while leaders of Palestine said this operation was an excessive use of force and called on international intervention. Humanitarian Concerns The United Nations, among other international organizations, has voiced deep concern over the increasingly heavy toll among civilians in the region. The calls for restraint and dialogue have become louder, urging both sides to de-escalate and find a peaceful resolution. Human rights groups have called for independent investigations into the conduct of military operations to ensure accountability. With these unfolding events, the West Bank is on edge. The situation keeps pointing to a real call for the region's lasting peace and stability through renewal efforts.The post 6 dead, 35 injured as Israel launches major West Bank operation first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/6-dead-35-injured-israel-major-west-bank-operation/	2025-01-21T08:09:09-08:00	
Israeli army chief resigns over October 7 fiasco	Israeli Army Chief Resigns Following October 7 Controversy The resignation of Israel's army chief has sent shockwaves across the nation, reflecting a response to the fallout from the October 7 incident. The event, which has been widely criticized as a significant security lapse, has drawn attention to the challenges faced by Israel’s military leadership during one of the most scrutinized periods in its history. October 7: A Day of Controversy On October 7, a series of events unfolded that many analysts have described as a major intelligence and operational failure. The details surrounding the incident revealed gaps in preparation and execution, leaving both the military and political leadership facing tough questions. The army chief's decision to step down comes amid growing public discontent and a wave of criticism from security experts and government officials. The incident exposed vulnerabilities in Israel’s otherwise robust defense system, prompting widespread calls for accountability. Public pressure on the military leadership has intensified in recent weeks, with protests and demands for transparency adding to the mounting scrutiny. Resignation and Its Implications The army chief’s resignation marks a pivotal moment, as it underscores the deep challenges faced by Israel’s defense establishment. This move has been interpreted by some as an acknowledgment of responsibility, while others view it as a strategic decision to allow fresh leadership to address ongoing concerns. Military insiders have described the resignation as a critical step toward restoring public confidence in the armed forces. This development comes as Israel continues to face a volatile security environment, with heightened tensions in the region requiring swift and decisive action from its military. The resignation also raises questions about the future direction of Israel's defense strategy and how the military intends to rebuild trust within its ranks and among the public. Moving Forward As Israel’s government and military prepare to appoint a new chief, many are hopeful that this leadership transition will bring about meaningful reforms. Addressing the structural and strategic weaknesses exposed by the October 7 incident will be a top priority. For the public, the resignation serves as a reminder of the importance of accountability in maintaining the nation’s security and resilience.The post Israeli army chief resigns over October 7 fiasco first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-army-chief-resigns-october-7-fiasco/	2025-01-21T08:08:59-08:00	
US pledges $117 million aid to Lebanese Army	In a significant move to bolster Lebanon's security infrastructure, the United States has pledged over $117 million in security assistance to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and Internal Security Forces (ISF). This commitment comes as Lebanon seeks to implement a fragile ceasefire with Israel, following a two-month conflict with Hezbollah that concluded in November 2024. The U.S. State Department announced the aid package after a virtual donors' meeting, emphasizing that the funds aim to support Lebanon in asserting sovereignty across its territory. The assistance is intended to enhance the capabilities of the LAF and ISF in maintaining peace and security, particularly in southern Lebanon, where tensions have historically been high. In addition to the new aid package, the Biden administration has redirected over $100 million in military assistance from Israel and Egypt to Lebanon. This reallocation includes $95 million initially designated for Egypt and $7.5 million for Israel. The decision underscores the U.S. commitment to supporting the Lebanese military in enforcing the ceasefire and countering threats from groups like Hezbollah. Implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701 A critical aspect of the U.S. assistance is facilitating Lebanon's adherence to UN Security Council Resolution 1701, adopted in 2006. This resolution calls for a full cessation of hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel and mandates the Lebanese government to exercise authority over all its territory. The enhanced capabilities of the LAF and ISF, supported by U.S. aid, are expected to play a pivotal role in implementing this resolution effectively. The U.S. aid aims to empower the Lebanese military as the nation's sole legitimate defense force, thereby reducing the influence of non-state actors like Hezbollah. By professionalizing the LAF and enhancing its operational capabilities, the assistance seeks to promote stability and security within Lebanon's borders. This move aligns with broader international efforts to support Lebanon's sovereignty and political independence. The U.S. pledge is part of a broader international initiative to support Lebanon during its recovery from recent conflicts and ongoing economic challenges. The virtual donors' meeting convened by the State Department reflects a coordinated effort among global partners to provide critical security assistance to Lebanon. The successful implementation of the ceasefire and the strengthening of Lebanon's security institutions are seen as essential steps toward long-term peace and stability in the region. The United States' commitment of over $117 million in security assistance to Lebanon represents a strategic effort to bolster the nation's defense capabilities and support the implementation of a crucial ceasefire with Israel. By enhancing the operational effectiveness of the Lebanese Armed Forces and Internal Security Forces, this aid aims to promote stability, assert Lebanon's sovereignty, and contribute to lasting peace in a historically volatile region.The post US pledges $117 million aid to Lebanese Army first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-117-million-aid-lebanese-army/	2025-01-19T08:31:10-08:00	
Breaking: Gaza ceasefire takes effect after 3-hour delay	Gaza Ceasefire Takes Effect After Delayed Implementation A long-awaited ceasefire in Gaza finally took effect following a three-hour delay, marking a potential halt to weeks of intense conflict between Israel and Palestinian militant groups. The truce, brokered by international mediators, was initially scheduled to commence earlier but faced setbacks due to last-minute disagreements over key terms. Reports suggest that the delay stemmed from disagreements between the negotiating parties over ceasefire protocols and verification mechanisms. Diplomatic sources revealed that mediators worked tirelessly to bridge the gaps, ensuring that the agreement held firm once implemented. These additional discussions aimed to secure a sustainable pause in hostilities and avoid immediate violations. The implementation of the ceasefire brings a much-needed respite to civilians in Gaza and southern Israel, who have borne the brunt of the recent escalation. Weeks of airstrikes and rocket fire have resulted in significant casualties, widespread destruction, and severe disruption to daily life. Hospitals and emergency services in Gaza were stretched to their limits, while many in Israel lived under constant threat of incoming rockets. With the ceasefire in place, both sides now face the challenge of maintaining the fragile peace. Humanitarian aid is expected to flow into Gaza, addressing urgent needs for medical supplies, food, and shelter. International organizations are also preparing to assess the damage and provide necessary assistance. Global leaders and organizations have welcomed the ceasefire, emphasizing the importance of both sides honoring the agreement. The United Nations called on all parties to exercise restraint and prioritize diplomatic solutions to prevent further escalation. Regional stakeholders, including Egypt and Qatar, played pivotal roles in mediating the truce and have urged continued dialogue. While the ceasefire marks a significant step toward de-escalation, experts caution that it is only a temporary solution. Long-term peace in the region will require addressing underlying issues, including political grievances, security concerns, and the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. As international mediators monitor the truce, the hope is that this ceasefire can pave the way for broader negotiations and a lasting resolution. This development offers a glimmer of hope for the region, but sustained effort will be needed to ensure the peace holds and a cycle of violence does not resume.The post Breaking: Gaza ceasefire takes effect after 3-hour delay first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/gaza-ceasefire-effect-3-hour-delay/	2025-01-19T08:30:53-08:00	
Manchester Utd vs Rangers Prediction: 23/1/2025	It's been a rollercoaster ride of a sojourn in the Europa League by Manchester United, really, with glimpses of excellence sandwiched by periods of very mediocre displays. Experience combines promising youngsters, most notably Rasmus Højlund, supported by the electric Marcus Rashford, who fires up the attack; then, of course, there is the creative midfield dynamism provided by Bruno Fernandes and Christian Eriksen; Victor Lindelöf holds together a backline at the back. With this mix of experience and youthful dynamism, Manchester United is really pushing hard to go further into the competition. Meanwhile, Rangers, under the guidance of coach Peter Laviolette, have been working on solidifying their structure in defense and overall team play. Though there have been some bumps, Laviolette remains optimistic and has instilled a sense of resilience within the squad. Artemi Panarin has been huge with his goal-scoring ability, while Igor Shesterkin's outstanding goalkeeping has proved critical in securing wins. Vincent Trocheck and Adam Fox have also played key roles, making great contributions to the team's success. With both teams ready for a go, the action to be taken at Manchester United's home ground against Rangers surely appears to become something of real anticipation. Coming to the form guide, Rangers reach in good spirit for this match as the Scotts recently grabbed convincing wins over Aberdeen (3-0) and St Johnstone (3-1). There were instances seen how they did business in their home games. Even in closer games, such as the 1-1 draw with Dundee FC and the pulsating 3-3 draw with Hibernian, Rangers have shown resilience and fighting spirit. Manchester United must be alert to the attacking intentions of Rangers and flexibility in their play. The backline will be put to a stern test, while Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford will be in for great performances to neutralize Rangers' tide. The game is going to be one fascinating contest of strategies and individual brilliance, with both teams keen to assert dominance. This highly anticipated match on 23rd January 2025 is tipped to conclude with a surprising win for Rangers with a 3-1 outcome. Recent form and domination in the pitch are certain reasons that might enable them to carry on the same rhythm in this game also against Manchester United. Although United has enough talents and depth to try to cause some problems, it's Rangers's relentless attack and strong defensive structure that could get the better of them. A mix of offensive sharpness and defensive discipline might just yield an emphatic away win for the Scottish side. Prediction Manchester United's home games have been quite entertaining this season, with nine of their last 12 matches at Old Trafford producing over 2.5 goals. Similarly, Rangers' recent away games have seen high goal counts as well, with six of their last eight away matches also producing over 2.5 goals. It promises to be an exciting game full of attacking football.

Gaza ceasefire set to start Sunday morning after Israeli approval	In what constitutes a major effort toward de-escalation, a ceasefire is scheduled to take effect this Sunday morning in the conflict involving Israel and Palestinian groups from Gaza. After weeks of aggression and destruction on both sides, Israeli authorities have reportedly agreed to an Egypt-brokered truce aimed at ending an uptick in violence that took its worst turn in years. The latest violence in Gaza erupted after a number of escalations that included everything from airstrikes to missiles to ground operations. It had resulted in heavy civilian casualties apart from the broad damage to infrastructure, at the same place where a continuing humanitarian crisis is threatening the Gaza Strip. Violence brought international attention through countries and agencies that urged a complete stop of the conflict without further delay. Mediation efforts had been ongoing for weeks, and regional powers including Egypt and Qatar have played an influential role in trying to broker the talks between the parties. In addition, there has been involvement by the United Nations and the United States in calling for a ceasefire, above all to preserve civilian lives and prevent further aggravation. Points of Ceasefire Agreement The ceasefire deal is said to have a host of engagements to ensure stability and avoid further violence. This agreement entails, among others: Cessation of all military operations by both Israel and Palestinian factions. Commitment to the re-opening of crossing points in the Gaza strip to allow normal goods and humanitarian access into the territory. Commitment to finding lasting answers for the people of Gaza on humanitarian grounds regarding health facilities and rebuilding. Machinery for monitoring compliance by both parties. While the details of this agreement remain unknown at this time, cautious optimism emanated from both parties, relating to this, in the hope of sustainability of this very ceasefire. Day International Reactions The international community has welcomed the announcement of a ceasefire with feelings of relief and hope. World leaders and humanitarian organizations have welcomed the decision, underlining that peace needs to be guarded and the root causes of the conflict brought into the spotlight. The UN Secretary-General called on all sides to stand by the deal and work for something more permanent for lasting solution. Similarly, the European Union and the United States called for restraint and underlined the need for alleviation of humanitarian woes in Gaza. While the ceasefire represents a critical step toward peace, significant challenges remain. Historically, ceasefires in the region have been fragile, with both sides often accusing each other of violations. The success of this agreement will depend on the commitment of both parties to honor their obligations and the effectiveness of the mechanisms in place to monitor compliance. Another major challenge remains the addressing of root causes of the conflict. Issues at the forefront, like territorial disputes over access to resources and political recognition, continue to be a source of tension. Without one clear, enduring solution, the risk of future escalations will remain elevated. Moreover, the humanitarian situation in Gaza remains critical. Besides the repetitive violence, years of blockade have turned the majority of its population dependent on international aid. Rebuilding will require much investment and support from the international community, neither of which may be feasible for long. From the Humanitarian Viewpoint The ceasefire brings some hope to the people of Gaza after days of fear and damage. Several families have been displaced and have lost access to food, water, and any form of medical care. Reopening the border crossings will be a great boon, allowing humanitarian loads with basic supplies to get through. The various on-ground organizations are now gearing up their operations to cater to the requirements of the needy. Yet they emphasize that if this offensive is stopped, it must also be translated into work in the fields that contribute to improving living standards in this troubled region. Success for the ceasefire will be realized in the coming days, which calls for restraint and serious commitment to peace from Israel and the different Palestinian factions. International stakeholders need to be consistently involved in support and, when necessary, in putting pressure to ensure this agreement holds. This cannot be achieved with a ceasefire alone; what is needed for long-term stability is sustained dialogue, mutual understanding, and removal of the lingering bitterness. However fraught the path to peace might be, it is a major step in the right direction. The Gaza cease-fire that took effect on Sunday morning is a much-needed break in hostilities that has inflicted so much damage on both sides. While the challenges going forward are significant, the approval of the ceasefire by Israeli authorities and the involvement of international mediators signal a collective desire for peace. Going forward, all parties must work together to ensure that this agreement is upheld and to pave the way toward a more stable and prosperous future in the region.The post Gaza ceasefire set to start Sunday morning after Israeli approval first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/gaza-ceasefire-start-sunday-morning-israeli-approval/	2025-01-18T05:19:27-08:00	
Israeli cabinet approves Gaza ceasefire deal	Israel's security cabinet approved a ceasefire and hostage release agreement that is to be implemented over this weekend. The deal aims at halting the continuing violence in Gaza, besides releasing hostages taken during the Hamas attack last October 2023. Now, the deal needs to be approved by Israel's full cabinet. It involved mediation by Qatar, the United States, and Egypt, but it also provided for the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. The war, sparked off by the Hamas attack, resulted in huge losses of life and heavy destruction of property. The campaign by Israel's military has left most of Gaza in ruins, with reports of tens of thousands of civilian deaths. It is expected that hostages, including women and children, will be released in stages beginning on Sunday. Hamas warned that further airstrikes by Israel could undermine the deal. The hostage crisis, finally over in Israel, has brought a mix of relief and anxiety as the families of their loved ones hold on to hope for their return. International figures such as U.S. President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron have voiced support for the deal, while Biden has insinuated the deal could offer a lasting resolution. In the run-up to the ceasefire and exchanges of prisoners, technical discussions are held in Egypt. At the time of filing this report, the massive destruction and displacement of nearly all 2.4 million residents created an overwhelming task for the aid organizations operating in Gaza.The post Israeli cabinet approves Gaza ceasefire deal first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-cabinet-approves-gaza-ceasefire-deal/	2025-01-17T08:54:32-08:00	
Russia and Iran sign strategic partnership treaty	Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian have signed an all-encompassing cooperation deal as their ties get closer in the midst of ongoing Western sanctions. A 'comprehensive strategic partnership treaty' was the tag used to refer to the agreement, which envelops areas ranging from trade to military collaboration, science, education, and culture. This critical development comes just days ahead of the swearing-in of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to try to resolve the conflict in Ukraine and take a more assertive stance toward Iran as it faces economic difficulties and battlefield defeats in the Middle East. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the accord was planned many months ago and was not linked to the incoming U.S. administration. During the talks, Putin expressed optimism about the treaty, stating it would enhance cooperation across all sectors. Pezeshkian, marking his third meeting with Putin since assuming office, described the agreement as a solid basis for advancing bilateral relations. He emphasized the importance of regional countries resolving their issues independently and criticized foreign interventions for creating instability. The relationship between Russia and Iran has dramatically improved since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Teheran and Moscow have denied the suggestion that Iran is supplying Russia with drones to use in the war, but with both nations under sanctions and pressure from other countries, their mutual alignment has increased. The inclusion of Iran in the BRICS economic bloc only puts a finer point on its closeness to Moscow. The Russian-Iranian relationship first took a turn for the better after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, when Moscow emerged as a main trading partner and supplier of defense for Tehran. Russia was instrumental in developing Iran's nuclear energy program and signed the 2015 nuclear deal which lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for it scaling back its nuclear program. The agreement came under stress after the U.S. pulled out under Trump. Russia and Iran also allied in the Syrian civil war to prop up Bashar al-Assad's regime. But the recent ouster of Assad in a surprise opposition surge, and his subsequent fleeing to Russia, has been a severe blow to Iran's regional reach. Furthermore, Tehran has been at a disadvantage in the light of continuous Israeli military attacks against Iran-aligned factions and its own facilities. Confronting an expanding array of regional and economic challenges, Iran is receiving state-of-the-art military hardware from Russia, including air defense systems and fighter aircraft, in efforts to shore up its defenses against the perceived threat of Israeli aggression. The deal underlines strategic ties between Moscow and Tehran amid shared challenges and a rapidly changing world environment.The post Russia and Iran sign strategic partnership treaty first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/russia-iran-strategic-partnership-treaty/	2025-01-17T08:49:25-08:00	
Israel’s first strike on new Syrian security forces kills three	An Israeli airstrike on January 15, 2025 targeted a military installation of Syria's newly established Islamist-led authorities and left three people dead. This marks the first time Israel has struck at the new security forces of Syria. It was an early morning attack. The facility that was attacked was close to the capital city of Damascus. According to a medical source, three were killed, and a number of others were injured. Israel has conducted hundreds of airstrikes in Syria, mostly to degrade the supply of the most sophisticated weapons to Hezbollah and to hinder Iranian military embeddedness. Regional security dynamics have become even more difficult with the Islamist-led security forces emerging recently in Syria, compelling Israel to reassess its strategic objectives in light of these new realities. This development underlines the continuing volatility in the Middle East, with Israel always on guard against perceived threats from across its borders. The airstrike sends a signal to the new rulers in Syria about Israel's red lines on questions of security. It also reflects the dilemmas of regional actors balancing their relationships of friendship and enmity in a fast-changing geopolitical landscape. Up to now, there has been complete silence from the Syrian government over the airstrikes. The international community continues to monitor the situation closely, given the potential implications for broader regional stability. The Israeli airstrike that killed three members of Syria's new security forces represents a dangerous escalation in the security dynamics of the region. With both countries taking tentative steps through this sensitive environment, the international community can only look on with concern and hope for steps to be taken to prevent further escalation and promote stability in the Middle East.The post Israel’s first strike on new Syrian security forces kills three first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israels-first-strike-new-syrian-security-forces-kills-three/	2025-01-15T09:43:59-08:00	
Salam schedules government formation talks for Wednesday and Thur...	Prime Minister-designate Nawaf Salam will hold non-binding parliamentary consultations on forming a new government on Wednesday and Thursday, according to a statement from Parliament's Secretariat-General. The consultations will begin on Wednesday, with Salam meeting parliamentary blocs between 10:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. On Thursday, he will meet with independent MPs from 10:00 a.m. to 6:45 p.m., as outlined in the official schedule. On Tuesday, Salam emphasized his commitment to inclusivity in Lebanon, stating he would not exclude any group, including Hezbollah. This is significant given Hezbollah's historical opposition to his appointment as prime minister and its preference for a different candidate this year. Salam, who currently heads the International Court of Justice, has pledged to extend the state's authority across all regions of Lebanon. His appointment came on Monday after he secured the support of a parliamentary majority, leading President Joseph Aoun to formally task him with forming a government. In past years, Hezbollah and its allies have opposed Salam’s candidacy, portraying him as aligned with U.S. interests. However, Salam signaled a desire to move past such divisions, declaring that it is time to begin a new chapter. Acknowledging the challenges Lebanon faces, Salam referenced the hardships caused by the recent Israeli aggression and the severe economic crisis that has impoverished many Lebanese citizens. He extended an open invitation to all parties to collaborate on advancing Lebanon’s recovery, implementing reforms, and undertaking reconstruction efforts. Both Salam and President Joseph Aoun, a recently elected army commander, are seen as separate from the entrenched political class that has dominated Lebanon since the civil war ended in 1990.The post Salam schedules government formation talks for Wednesday and Thursday first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/salam-government-talks-wednesday-thursday/	2025-01-14T08:18:43-08:00	
Aoun calls for swift government formation, stresses state duty ag...	President Joseph Aoun emphasized on Tuesday that the challenges facing Lebanon are not limited to any single group, such as the Shiites, but rather affect the entire nation. He reiterated that any loss for one part of the country is a loss for all. Speaking to a delegation from the Higher Islamic Shiite Council, led by Sheikh Ali al-Khatib, Aoun stressed the importance of unity in addressing Lebanon’s challenges. He highlighted the significant opportunities available to the country, urging all factions to work together without delay. Reconstruction, he said, is a top priority on his agenda, which drives his commitment to expedite the formation of a government. Aoun explained that forming a government quickly would allow him to begin visiting foreign nations to request support for Lebanon’s reconstruction efforts. He urged that no obstacles be placed in the way of this process. The president also underscored the importance of national sovereignty, stating that any attack on any part of Lebanon is an attack on the entire country. He reiterated Lebanon’s demand for the withdrawal of Israeli forces and the deployment of the Lebanese army in the south. Reflecting on Imam Moussa al-Sadr’s efforts to shield Lebanon from external conflicts, Aoun noted that if Lebanon had been a stable state with strong institutions at the time, al-Sadr would not have felt compelled to lead a resistance. Aoun emphasized that the current phase is different and that responsibility now rests with the state and the Lebanese people as a whole, rather than with a single group. He assured the Shiite delegation that he is committed to securing the release of Hezbollah fighters detained by Israel since the last war. Aoun pledged that no group in Lebanon would be abandoned, defeated, or marginalized, emphasizing the importance of solidarity. Addressing the recent appointment of Nawaf Salam as prime minister-designate, Aoun stated that the decision was the result of a democratic process that produced a clear outcome.The post Aoun calls for swift government formation, stresses state duty against Israel first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/aoun-calls-swift-government-formation-stresses-state-duty-against-israel/	2025-01-14T08:18:30-08:00
