6 dead, 35 injured as Israel launches major West Bank operation	A major Israeli military operation in the West Bank has killed six people and injured 35 others, local health officials said. The flare-up constitutes one of the most violent military operations in the region in recent months and adds to growing tensions between Israeli forces and Palestinian locals. The operation, targeting the suspected militant strongholds in the hotbeds of the West Bank, saw the deployment of heavy contingents comprising Israeli forces with support from both land and air. According to the military sources in Israel, the mission had aimed at dissipating what they referred to as an imminent threat at the hands of the militant factions. Various arrests were said to be carried out in the operation where authorities claimed they had spotted caches of weapons and explosive devices. The affected areas' eyewitnesses told about scenes of chaos when heavy gunfire and explosions echoed across residential areas. Locals were compelled to flee from their homes as the medical teams fought against the clock to attend to the casualties. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society has documented a number of injuries with live ammunition and shrapnel. This operation is part of the escalation of violence in the West Bank, where visible violence has been rising over the last weeks. The streak of clashes that includes retaliation attacks from both sides makes the threat of further instability even higher. Israeli authorities once more vowed to maintain security within the borders of Israel, while leaders of Palestine said this operation was an excessive use of force and called on international intervention. Humanitarian Concerns The United Nations, among other international organizations, has voiced deep concern over the increasingly heavy toll among civilians in the region. The calls for restraint and dialogue have become louder, urging both sides to de-escalate and find a peaceful resolution. Human rights groups have called for independent investigations into the conduct of military operations to ensure accountability. With these unfolding events, the West Bank is on edge. The situation keeps pointing to a real call for the region's lasting peace and stability through renewal efforts.The post 6 dead, 35 injured as Israel launches major West Bank operation first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/6-dead-35-injured-israel-major-west-bank-operation/	2025-01-21T08:09:09-08:00	
Israeli army chief resigns over October 7 fiasco	Israeli Army Chief Resigns Following October 7 Controversy The resignation of Israel's army chief has sent shockwaves across the nation, reflecting a response to the fallout from the October 7 incident. The event, which has been widely criticized as a significant security lapse, has drawn attention to the challenges faced by Israel’s military leadership during one of the most scrutinized periods in its history. October 7: A Day of Controversy On October 7, a series of events unfolded that many analysts have described as a major intelligence and operational failure. The details surrounding the incident revealed gaps in preparation and execution, leaving both the military and political leadership facing tough questions. The army chief's decision to step down comes amid growing public discontent and a wave of criticism from security experts and government officials. The incident exposed vulnerabilities in Israel’s otherwise robust defense system, prompting widespread calls for accountability. Public pressure on the military leadership has intensified in recent weeks, with protests and demands for transparency adding to the mounting scrutiny. Resignation and Its Implications The army chief’s resignation marks a pivotal moment, as it underscores the deep challenges faced by Israel’s defense establishment. This move has been interpreted by some as an acknowledgment of responsibility, while others view it as a strategic decision to allow fresh leadership to address ongoing concerns. Military insiders have described the resignation as a critical step toward restoring public confidence in the armed forces. This development comes as Israel continues to face a volatile security environment, with heightened tensions in the region requiring swift and decisive action from its military. The resignation also raises questions about the future direction of Israel's defense strategy and how the military intends to rebuild trust within its ranks and among the public. Moving Forward As Israel’s government and military prepare to appoint a new chief, many are hopeful that this leadership transition will bring about meaningful reforms. Addressing the structural and strategic weaknesses exposed by the October 7 incident will be a top priority. For the public, the resignation serves as a reminder of the importance of accountability in maintaining the nation’s security and resilience.The post Israeli army chief resigns over October 7 fiasco first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-army-chief-resigns-october-7-fiasco/	2025-01-21T08:08:59-08:00	
US pledges $117 million aid to Lebanese Army	In a significant move to bolster Lebanon's security infrastructure, the United States has pledged over $117 million in security assistance to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and Internal Security Forces (ISF). This commitment comes as Lebanon seeks to implement a fragile ceasefire with Israel, following a two-month conflict with Hezbollah that concluded in November 2024. The U.S. State Department announced the aid package after a virtual donors' meeting, emphasizing that the funds aim to support Lebanon in asserting sovereignty across its territory. The assistance is intended to enhance the capabilities of the LAF and ISF in maintaining peace and security, particularly in southern Lebanon, where tensions have historically been high. In addition to the new aid package, the Biden administration has redirected over $100 million in military assistance from Israel and Egypt to Lebanon. This reallocation includes $95 million initially designated for Egypt and $7.5 million for Israel. The decision underscores the U.S. commitment to supporting the Lebanese military in enforcing the ceasefire and countering threats from groups like Hezbollah. Implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701 A critical aspect of the U.S. assistance is facilitating Lebanon's adherence to UN Security Council Resolution 1701, adopted in 2006. This resolution calls for a full cessation of hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel and mandates the Lebanese government to exercise authority over all its territory. The enhanced capabilities of the LAF and ISF, supported by U.S. aid, are expected to play a pivotal role in implementing this resolution effectively. The U.S. aid aims to empower the Lebanese military as the nation's sole legitimate defense force, thereby reducing the influence of non-state actors like Hezbollah. By professionalizing the LAF and enhancing its operational capabilities, the assistance seeks to promote stability and security within Lebanon's borders. This move aligns with broader international efforts to support Lebanon's sovereignty and political independence. The U.S. pledge is part of a broader international initiative to support Lebanon during its recovery from recent conflicts and ongoing economic challenges. The virtual donors' meeting convened by the State Department reflects a coordinated effort among global partners to provide critical security assistance to Lebanon. The successful implementation of the ceasefire and the strengthening of Lebanon's security institutions are seen as essential steps toward long-term peace and stability in the region. The United States' commitment of over $117 million in security assistance to Lebanon represents a strategic effort to bolster the nation's defense capabilities and support the implementation of a crucial ceasefire with Israel. By enhancing the operational effectiveness of the Lebanese Armed Forces and Internal Security Forces, this aid aims to promote stability, assert Lebanon's sovereignty, and contribute to lasting peace in a historically volatile region.The post US pledges $117 million aid to Lebanese Army first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-117-million-aid-lebanese-army/	2025-01-19T08:31:10-08:00	
Breaking: Gaza ceasefire takes effect after 3-hour delay	Gaza Ceasefire Takes Effect After Delayed Implementation A long-awaited ceasefire in Gaza finally took effect following a three-hour delay, marking a potential halt to weeks of intense conflict between Israel and Palestinian militant groups. The truce, brokered by international mediators, was initially scheduled to commence earlier but faced setbacks due to last-minute disagreements over key terms. Reports suggest that the delay stemmed from disagreements between the negotiating parties over ceasefire protocols and verification mechanisms. Diplomatic sources revealed that mediators worked tirelessly to bridge the gaps, ensuring that the agreement held firm once implemented. These additional discussions aimed to secure a sustainable pause in hostilities and avoid immediate violations. The implementation of the ceasefire brings a much-needed respite to civilians in Gaza and southern Israel, who have borne the brunt of the recent escalation. Weeks of airstrikes and rocket fire have resulted in significant casualties, widespread destruction, and severe disruption to daily life. Hospitals and emergency services in Gaza were stretched to their limits, while many in Israel lived under constant threat of incoming rockets. With the ceasefire in place, both sides now face the challenge of maintaining the fragile peace. Humanitarian aid is expected to flow into Gaza, addressing urgent needs for medical supplies, food, and shelter. International organizations are also preparing to assess the damage and provide necessary assistance. Global leaders and organizations have welcomed the ceasefire, emphasizing the importance of both sides honoring the agreement. The United Nations called on all parties to exercise restraint and prioritize diplomatic solutions to prevent further escalation. Regional stakeholders, including Egypt and Qatar, played pivotal roles in mediating the truce and have urged continued dialogue. While the ceasefire marks a significant step toward de-escalation, experts caution that it is only a temporary solution. Long-term peace in the region will require addressing underlying issues, including political grievances, security concerns, and the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. As international mediators monitor the truce, the hope is that this ceasefire can pave the way for broader negotiations and a lasting resolution. This development offers a glimmer of hope for the region, but sustained effort will be needed to ensure the peace holds and a cycle of violence does not resume.The post Breaking: Gaza ceasefire takes effect after 3-hour delay first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/gaza-ceasefire-effect-3-hour-delay/	2025-01-19T08:30:53-08:00	
Manchester Utd vs Rangers Prediction: 23/1/2025	It's been a rollercoaster ride of a sojourn in the Europa League by Manchester United, really, with glimpses of excellence sandwiched by periods of very mediocre displays. Experience combines promising youngsters, most notably Rasmus Højlund, supported by the electric Marcus Rashford, who fires up the attack; then, of course, there is the creative midfield dynamism provided by Bruno Fernandes and Christian Eriksen; Victor Lindelöf holds together a backline at the back. With this mix of experience and youthful dynamism, Manchester United is really pushing hard to go further into the competition. Meanwhile, Rangers, under the guidance of coach Peter Laviolette, have been working on solidifying their structure in defense and overall team play. Though there have been some bumps, Laviolette remains optimistic and has instilled a sense of resilience within the squad. Artemi Panarin has been huge with his goal-scoring ability, while Igor Shesterkin's outstanding goalkeeping has proved critical in securing wins. Vincent Trocheck and Adam Fox have also played key roles, making great contributions to the team's success. With both teams ready for a go, the action to be taken at Manchester United's home ground against Rangers surely appears to become something of real anticipation. Coming to the form guide, Rangers reach in good spirit for this match as the Scotts recently grabbed convincing wins over Aberdeen (3-0) and St Johnstone (3-1). There were instances seen how they did business in their home games. Even in closer games, such as the 1-1 draw with Dundee FC and the pulsating 3-3 draw with Hibernian, Rangers have shown resilience and fighting spirit. Manchester United must be alert to the attacking intentions of Rangers and flexibility in their play. The backline will be put to a stern test, while Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford will be in for great performances to neutralize Rangers' tide. The game is going to be one fascinating contest of strategies and individual brilliance, with both teams keen to assert dominance. This highly anticipated match on 23rd January 2025 is tipped to conclude with a surprising win for Rangers with a 3-1 outcome. Recent form and domination in the pitch are certain reasons that might enable them to carry on the same rhythm in this game also against Manchester United. Although United has enough talents and depth to try to cause some problems, it's Rangers's relentless attack and strong defensive structure that could get the better of them. A mix of offensive sharpness and defensive discipline might just yield an emphatic away win for the Scottish side. Prediction Manchester United's home games have been quite entertaining this season, with nine of their last 12 matches at Old Trafford producing over 2.5 goals. Similarly, Rangers' recent away games have seen high goal counts as well, with six of their last eight away matches also producing over 2.5 goals. It promises to be an exciting game full of attacking football. Prediction: Manchester United 1 - 3 RangersThe post Manchester Utd vs Rangers Prediction: 23/1/2025 first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/manchester-utd-vs-rangers-prediction-23-1-2025/	2025-01-19T03:19:13-08:00	
Gaza ceasefire set to start Sunday morning after Israeli approval	In what constitutes a major effort toward de-escalation, a ceasefire is scheduled to take effect this Sunday morning in the conflict involving Israel and Palestinian groups from Gaza. After weeks of aggression and destruction on both sides, Israeli authorities have reportedly agreed to an Egypt-brokered truce aimed at ending an uptick in violence that took its worst turn in years. The latest violence in Gaza erupted after a number of escalations that included everything from airstrikes to missiles to ground operations. It had resulted in heavy civilian casualties apart from the broad damage to infrastructure, at the same place where a continuing humanitarian crisis is threatening the Gaza Strip. Violence brought international attention through countries and agencies that urged a complete stop of the conflict without further delay. Mediation efforts had been ongoing for weeks, and regional powers including Egypt and Qatar have played an influential role in trying to broker the talks between the parties. In addition, there has been involvement by the United Nations and the United States in calling for a ceasefire, above all to preserve civilian lives and prevent further aggravation. Points of Ceasefire Agreement The ceasefire deal is said to have a host of engagements to ensure stability and avoid further violence. This agreement entails, among others: Cessation of all military operations by both Israel and Palestinian factions. Commitment to the re-opening of crossing points in the Gaza strip to allow normal goods and humanitarian access into the territory. Commitment to finding lasting answers for the people of Gaza on humanitarian grounds regarding health facilities and rebuilding. Machinery for monitoring compliance by both parties. While the details of this agreement remain unknown at this time, cautious optimism emanated from both parties, relating to this, in the hope of sustainability of this very ceasefire. Day International Reactions The international community has welcomed the announcement of a ceasefire with feelings of relief and hope. World leaders and humanitarian organizations have welcomed the decision, underlining that peace needs to be guarded and the root causes of the conflict brought into the spotlight. The UN Secretary-General called on all sides to stand by the deal and work for something more permanent for lasting solution. Similarly, the European Union and the United States called for restraint and underlined the need for alleviation of humanitarian woes in Gaza. While the ceasefire represents a critical step toward peace, significant challenges remain. Historically, ceasefires in the region have been fragile, with both sides often accusing each other of violations. The success of this agreement will depend on the commitment of both parties to honor their obligations and the effectiveness of the mechanisms in place to monitor compliance. Another major challenge remains the addressing of root causes of the conflict. Issues at the forefront, like territorial disputes over access to resources and political recognition, continue to be a source of tension. Without one clear, enduring solution, the risk of future escalations will remain elevated. Moreover, the humanitarian situation in Gaza remains critical. Besides the repetitive violence, years of blockade have turned the majority of its population dependent on international aid. Rebuilding will require much investment and support from the international community, neither of which may be feasible for long. From the Humanitarian Viewpoint The ceasefire brings some hope to the people of Gaza after days of fear and damage. Several families have been displaced and have lost access to food, water, and any form of medical care. Reopening the border crossings will be a great boon, allowing humanitarian loads with basic supplies to get through. The various on-ground organizations are now gearing up their operations to cater to the requirements of the needy. Yet they emphasize that if this offensive is stopped, it must also be translated into work in the fields that contribute to improving living standards in this troubled region. Success for the ceasefire will be realized in the coming days, which calls for restraint and serious commitment to peace from Israel and the different Palestinian factions. International stakeholders need to be consistently involved in support and, when necessary, in putting pressure to ensure this agreement holds. This cannot be achieved with a ceasefire alone; what is needed for long-term stability is sustained dialogue, mutual understanding, and removal of the lingering bitterness. However fraught the path to peace might be, it is a major step in the right direction. The Gaza cease-fire that took effect on Sunday morning is a much-needed break in hostilities that has inflicted so much damage on both sides. While the challenges going forward are significant, the approval of the ceasefire by Israeli authorities and the involvement of international mediators signal a collective desire for peace. Going forward, all parties must work together to ensure that this agreement is upheld and to pave the way toward a more stable and prosperous future in the region.The post Gaza ceasefire set to start Sunday morning after Israeli approval first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/gaza-ceasefire-start-sunday-morning-israeli-approval/	2025-01-18T05:19:27-08:00	
Israeli cabinet approves Gaza ceasefire deal	Israel's security cabinet approved a ceasefire and hostage release agreement that is to be implemented over this weekend. The deal aims at halting the continuing violence in Gaza, besides releasing hostages taken during the Hamas attack last October 2023. Now, the deal needs to be approved by Israel's full cabinet. It involved mediation by Qatar, the United States, and Egypt, but it also provided for the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. The war, sparked off by the Hamas attack, resulted in huge losses of life and heavy destruction of property. The campaign by Israel's military has left most of Gaza in ruins, with reports of tens of thousands of civilian deaths. It is expected that hostages, including women and children, will be released in stages beginning on Sunday. Hamas warned that further airstrikes by Israel could undermine the deal. The hostage crisis, finally over in Israel, has brought a mix of relief and anxiety as the families of their loved ones hold on to hope for their return. International figures such as U.S. President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron have voiced support for the deal, while Biden has insinuated the deal could offer a lasting resolution. In the run-up to the ceasefire and exchanges of prisoners, technical discussions are held in Egypt. At the time of filing this report, the massive destruction and displacement of nearly all 2.4 million residents created an overwhelming task for the aid organizations operating in Gaza.The post Israeli cabinet approves Gaza ceasefire deal first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-cabinet-approves-gaza-ceasefire-deal/	2025-01-17T08:54:32-08:00	
Russia and Iran sign strategic partnership treaty	Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian have signed an all-encompassing cooperation deal as their ties get closer in the midst of ongoing Western sanctions. A 'comprehensive strategic partnership treaty' was the tag used to refer to the agreement, which envelops areas ranging from trade to military collaboration, science, education, and culture. This critical development comes just days ahead of the swearing-in of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to try to resolve the conflict in Ukraine and take a more assertive stance toward Iran as it faces economic difficulties and battlefield defeats in the Middle East. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the accord was planned many months ago and was not linked to the incoming U.S. administration. During the talks, Putin expressed optimism about the treaty, stating it would enhance cooperation across all sectors. Pezeshkian, marking his third meeting with Putin since assuming office, described the agreement as a solid basis for advancing bilateral relations. He emphasized the importance of regional countries resolving their issues independently and criticized foreign interventions for creating instability. The relationship between Russia and Iran has dramatically improved since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Teheran and Moscow have denied the suggestion that Iran is supplying Russia with drones to use in the war, but with both nations under sanctions and pressure from other countries, their mutual alignment has increased. The inclusion of Iran in the BRICS economic bloc only puts a finer point on its closeness to Moscow. The Russian-Iranian relationship first took a turn for the better after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, when Moscow emerged as a main trading partner and supplier of defense for Tehran. Russia was instrumental in developing Iran's nuclear energy program and signed the 2015 nuclear deal which lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for it scaling back its nuclear program. The agreement came under stress after the U.S. pulled out under Trump. Russia and Iran also allied in the Syrian civil war to prop up Bashar al-Assad's regime. But the recent ouster of Assad in a surprise opposition surge, and his subsequent fleeing to Russia, has been a severe blow to Iran's regional reach. Furthermore, Tehran has been at a disadvantage in the light of continuous Israeli military attacks against Iran-aligned factions and its own facilities. Confronting an expanding array of regional and economic challenges, Iran is receiving state-of-the-art military hardware from Russia, including air defense systems and fighter aircraft, in efforts to shore up its defenses against the perceived threat of Israeli aggression. The deal underlines strategic ties between Moscow and Tehran amid shared challenges and a rapidly changing world environment.The post Russia and Iran sign strategic partnership treaty first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/russia-iran-strategic-partnership-treaty/	2025-01-17T08:49:25-08:00	
Israel’s first strike on new Syrian security forces kills three	An Israeli airstrike on January 15, 2025 targeted a military installation of Syria's newly established Islamist-led authorities and left three people dead. This marks the first time Israel has struck at the new security forces of Syria. It was an early morning attack. The facility that was attacked was close to the capital city of Damascus. According to a medical source, three were killed, and a number of others were injured. Israel has conducted hundreds of airstrikes in Syria, mostly to degrade the supply of the most sophisticated weapons to Hezbollah and to hinder Iranian military embeddedness. Regional security dynamics have become even more difficult with the Islamist-led security forces emerging recently in Syria, compelling Israel to reassess its strategic objectives in light of these new realities. This development underlines the continuing volatility in the Middle East, with Israel always on guard against perceived threats from across its borders. The airstrike sends a signal to the new rulers in Syria about Israel's red lines on questions of security. It also reflects the dilemmas of regional actors balancing their relationships of friendship and enmity in a fast-changing geopolitical landscape. Up to now, there has been complete silence from the Syrian government over the airstrikes. The international community continues to monitor the situation closely, given the potential implications for broader regional stability. The Israeli airstrike that killed three members of Syria's new security forces represents a dangerous escalation in the security dynamics of the region. With both countries taking tentative steps through this sensitive environment, the international community can only look on with concern and hope for steps to be taken to prevent further escalation and promote stability in the Middle East.The post Israel’s first strike on new Syrian security forces kills three first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israels-first-strike-new-syrian-security-forces-kills-three/	2025-01-15T09:43:59-08:00	
Salam schedules government formation talks for Wednesday and Thur...	Prime Minister-designate Nawaf Salam will hold non-binding parliamentary consultations on forming a new government on Wednesday and Thursday, according to a statement from Parliament's Secretariat-General. The consultations will begin on Wednesday, with Salam meeting parliamentary blocs between 10:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. On Thursday, he will meet with independent MPs from 10:00 a.m. to 6:45 p.m., as outlined in the official schedule. On Tuesday, Salam emphasized his commitment to inclusivity in Lebanon, stating he would not exclude any group, including Hezbollah. This is significant given Hezbollah's historical opposition to his appointment as prime minister and its preference for a different candidate this year. Salam, who currently heads the International Court of Justice, has pledged to extend the state's authority across all regions of Lebanon. His appointment came on Monday after he secured the support of a parliamentary majority, leading President Joseph Aoun to formally task him with forming a government. In past years, Hezbollah and its allies have opposed Salam’s candidacy, portraying him as aligned with U.S. interests. However, Salam signaled a desire to move past such divisions, declaring that it is time to begin a new chapter. Acknowledging the challenges Lebanon faces, Salam referenced the hardships caused by the recent Israeli aggression and the severe economic crisis that has impoverished many Lebanese citizens. He extended an open invitation to all parties to collaborate on advancing Lebanon’s recovery, implementing reforms, and undertaking reconstruction efforts. Both Salam and President Joseph Aoun, a recently elected army commander, are seen as separate from the entrenched political class that has dominated Lebanon since the civil war ended in 1990.The post Salam schedules government formation talks for Wednesday and Thursday first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/salam-government-talks-wednesday-thursday/	2025-01-14T08:18:43-08:00	
Aoun calls for swift government formation, stresses state duty ag...	President Joseph Aoun emphasized on Tuesday that the challenges facing Lebanon are not limited to any single group, such as the Shiites, but rather affect the entire nation. He reiterated that any loss for one part of the country is a loss for all. Speaking to a delegation from the Higher Islamic Shiite Council, led by Sheikh Ali al-Khatib, Aoun stressed the importance of unity in addressing Lebanon’s challenges. He highlighted the significant opportunities available to the country, urging all factions to work together without delay. Reconstruction, he said, is a top priority on his agenda, which drives his commitment to expedite the formation of a government. Aoun explained that forming a government quickly would allow him to begin visiting foreign nations to request support for Lebanon’s reconstruction efforts. He urged that no obstacles be placed in the way of this process. The president also underscored the importance of national sovereignty, stating that any attack on any part of Lebanon is an attack on the entire country. He reiterated Lebanon’s demand for the withdrawal of Israeli forces and the deployment of the Lebanese army in the south. Reflecting on Imam Moussa al-Sadr’s efforts to shield Lebanon from external conflicts, Aoun noted that if Lebanon had been a stable state with strong institutions at the time, al-Sadr would not have felt compelled to lead a resistance. Aoun emphasized that the current phase is different and that responsibility now rests with the state and the Lebanese people as a whole, rather than with a single group. He assured the Shiite delegation that he is committed to securing the release of Hezbollah fighters detained by Israel since the last war. Aoun pledged that no group in Lebanon would be abandoned, defeated, or marginalized, emphasizing the importance of solidarity. Addressing the recent appointment of Nawaf Salam as prime minister-designate, Aoun stated that the decision was the result of a democratic process that produced a clear outcome.The post Aoun calls for swift government formation, stresses state duty against Israel first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/aoun-calls-swift-government-formation-stresses-state-duty-against-israel/	2025-01-14T08:18:30-08:00	
Trump urges Israel to maintain calm in Lebanon and Syria	According to the report from Channel 12, Israel, a source there said that Donald Trump associates told top officials in Israel that President-elect Trump wants stability in the Middle East so that he can focus more on the needs inside his own nation. The new Trump administration's incoming representatives conveyed their desire to maintain peace in Lebanon and Syria, as evidenced by their statement, 'The president-elect does not want to encounter a new war during the initial days of his tenure.'. Furthermore, the senior officials have counselled Israel to avoid bellicose statements against the new Syrian leadership to prevent the situation from deteriorating in the region. They said that Syria's newly installed leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, has no interest in conflict with Israel at this point in time. A similar message has been conveyed about Lebanon, where the team of Trump is said to be eager for the current ceasefire to remain in place. They have mentioned that the president-elect is keen on not letting the military conflicts resume on Israel's northern border.The post Trump urges Israel to maintain calm in Lebanon and Syria first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/trump-urges-israel-maintain-calm-lebanon-syria/	2025-01-13T06:32:27-08:00	
Breakthrough in Israel-Hamas ceasefire and hostage release talks	Diplomatic efforts to reach a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war and the release of hostages in Gaza have gained significant momentum, officials say, but no deal has been inked yet. Talks brokered by U.S. and Arab mediators have neared an imminent potential agreement, though crucial differences remain. The coming days will be crucial, officials said, to end over 15 months of fighting that has caused anarchy in the Middle East. In an overnight breakthrough, mediators presented a proposed agreement to both sides. Negotiators from Israel and Hamas will now seek approval from their respective leaders. Pressure has been building from mediators, including Qatari officials pressing Hamas to accept the terms and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, weighing in with Israeli representatives. The next 24 hours are going to be pivotal in finalizing the draft agreement. The tentative plan reportedly includes a phased ceasefire: first, the partial release of hostages by Hamas in return for a temporary stoppage of the fighting; the broader ceasefire and other terms would be taken care of by the additional negotiations. Hamas has insisted on a complete end to the conflict and an Israeli withdrawal, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remains committed to continuing military operations until a decisive victory over Hamas is achieved. The agreement had faced months of stalemates in U.S.-led negotiations, which included Egypt and Qatar, with significant disagreements over a hostage prisoner exchange and over what exactly would comprise the cease-fire. The Biden Administration, eager for a finalized deal before President Biden leaves office, has pressed efforts to close outstanding gaps on hostage releases. The agreement has been in the making from US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Middle East envoy Brett McGurk, with Israeli intelligence chief David Barnea in Doha. Officials say they are optimistic, but much work remains, and time is short before the January 20 presidential inauguration. At the same time, the ground Palestinians in Gaza believe nothing is possible and that peace would not return soon. This war has dislocated 90% of its people, and numerous losses have occurred due to massive death tolls. The families of the hostages in Israel still demand the underneath the situation of safe circumstances and encouraging Netanyahu to get this done. This protracted conflict has caused immense human suffering, with over 46,000 Palestinians killed, mostly women and children, and significant casualties in Israel during the initial Hamas attack. Both sides are under mounting pressure to bring an end to the violence and establish a path toward resolution.The post Breakthrough in Israel-Hamas ceasefire and hostage release talks first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/breakthrough-israel-hamas-ceasefire/	2025-01-13T06:32:15-08:00	
Iran and EU powers to hold nuclear talks ahead of Trump return	Iran will engage in talks over its nuclear program with major European powers-France, the UK, and Germany-in Geneva on January 13. There is hope, amid these ongoing discussions, of solving concerns against Iran's nuclear policy and sanctions being enforced once again. This comes days before Donald Trump resurfaces at the helm in the U.S., a situation where tensions seem to be in an all-time high and every decision about Iran by him seems controversial. The JCPOA 2015 was a historical agreement whereby Iran agreed to cap its nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. However, in 2018, President Trump withdrew the U.S. from the deal, reinstating strict sanctions on Iran. In reaction, Iran gradually decreased its compliance with the agreement, escalating uranium enrichment activities. This can be seen to be the renewed efforts by European nations to address these issues in diplomatic talks, to not let things go further. European leaders are increasingly concerned about Iran's developing nuclear capabilities. French President Emmanuel Macron recently said that Iran's nuclear program is at a 'critical point,' and he urged the European partners to consider reinstating sanctions if Iran does not begin to make progress. The Geneva talks aim to find a diplomatic solution to reinstate some limitations on Iran's nuclear activities while providing economic relief that Iran is seeking. Iran's Stand and Expectations Iran had maintained it was a civilian program and asked for relief in place of the sanctions that badly hit the country's economy. Before the negotiations, Iran's foreign ministry had stressed the issue of removal of sanctions and offered an ear to concerns presented by the European parties. But Iran called on France to reverse its 'unconstructive' approach after comments from French officials on the possible reimposition of sanctions. Implications of Trump's Return The return of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency makes the negotiations even more complicated. Trump's previous 'maximum pressure' campaign increased tensions between the U.S. and Iran. European diplomats are aware that time is running out to achieve a diplomatic breakthrough before potential policy shifts under the new U.S. administration. The outcome of the Geneva talks could influence future U.S. strategies and the overall stability of the Middle East. The Geneva talks between Iran and European powers are at the critical juncture where addressing the problems created by Iran's nuclear program is crucial. In the setting of Donald Trump's return to the U.S. presidency, there is increased pressure for a peaceful resolution. The international community goes through a wait-and-see process in hopes that the dialogue will be productive, stabilizing the region and stopping the ongoing proliferation of nuclear arms.The post Iran and EU powers to hold nuclear talks ahead of Trump return first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/iran-eu-powers-hold-nuclear-talks-trump-return/	2025-01-13T06:32:07-08:00	
President Joseph Aoun begins consultations to name PM	**President Joseph Aoun Starts Consultations to Name New Prime Minister President Joseph Aoun has started consultations with parliamentary blocs and independent MPs with the aim of naming a new prime minister. This is very significant for Lebanon while it grapples with economic and political crises, for which strong leadership in governance is needed to put the country on the path of stability. The political scenario in Lebanon has been turbulent, replete with economic difficulties and public dissatisfaction. The last government had the onus for its inability to apply vital reforms and stabilize the economy, for which it came under unrelenting attacks. Given the current parliamentary makeup, consensus needs to be reached on a prime minister with whom different political blocs can come together and form an active government. President Aoun has reiterated that the new government should be in the interest of the nation and cater to the essential needs of Lebanese citizens. The consultations are meant to propose a candidate who can bring about consensus among the divided political and sectarian factions of the country. Key Stakeholders and Political Dynamics These consultations with President Aoun involve those heads of big political parties, independent Members of Parliament, and even those from the minorities. That has to ensure participation at any length and gets their varied ideas about the qualifications, priorities entailing the new Prime Minister. The process, according to analysts, would likely zero in on the individual who, until now, demonstrates some record in terms of reforms or anyone who should trust the nation on restoring foreign partners. The new prime minister will now have to take on Lebanon's spiraling economic crisis, the recovery from recent conflicts, and much-needed reforms. International observers and Lebanese citizens alike will be closely watching the process, hoping for a leader who can restore stability and confidence in the country's governance. As the consultations unfold, President Aoun will announce his decision in the coming days. This is going to be the capable government which is very important for Lebanon's future, especially at a time when the country is seeking international support and funding for recovery. It is also a moment of hope for Lebanese citizens, who wish this moment would usher in a better future for the country.The post President Joseph Aoun begins consultations to name PM first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/president-joseph-aoun-consultations-name-pm/	2025-01-13T06:31:58-08:00	
Netanyahu dispatches Mossad chief to Gaza ceasefire talks	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has taken a decisive step in addressing the escalating conflict in Gaza by sending Mossad chief David Barnea to participate in ceasefire negotiations. This move highlights the urgency and gravity of the situation, as violence continues to impact both Israeli and Palestinian civilians. The ongoing conflict has seen heightened tensions and significant casualties on both sides, prompting international calls for de-escalation. With Israel’s military operations intensifying in response to persistent rocket fire from Gaza, the need for a sustainable ceasefire has become more pressing. Netanyahu’s decision to involve Mossad, typically associated with intelligence and covert operations, underscores the complex dynamics at play in reaching a peaceful resolution. Barnea’s participation in the talks signals Israel’s intention to prioritize security concerns while exploring avenues for diplomacy. While details of the negotiations remain undisclosed, reports suggest that the focus will be on achieving an immediate halt to hostilities, addressing humanitarian challenges in Gaza, and setting the groundwork for longer-term stability in the region. The decision to involve Mossad reflects Netanyahu’s recognition of the multi-faceted nature of the conflict. Intelligence plays a critical role in understanding and countering security threats, and the agency’s involvement may provide unique insights that could facilitate the ceasefire process. These negotiations come amid heightened international scrutiny. Countries around the world, including the United States, Egypt, and Qatar, have called for restraint and are urging both parties to prioritize diplomacy. The involvement of global mediators may increase the chances of reaching a viable agreement, although challenges remain in bridging the deep-rooted mistrust between the parties. As talks progress, the focus will likely shift toward balancing Israel’s security interests with the need to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The outcomes of these negotiations will not only influence immediate peace efforts but could also set the tone for future discussions on long-term solutions to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.The post Netanyahu dispatches Mossad chief to Gaza ceasefire talks first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/netanyahu-mossad-chief-gaza-ceasefire-talks/	2025-01-12T09:47:54-08:00	
Israeli army reports four soldiers killed in north Gaza	The Israeli Defense Forces have announced that four soldiers have been killed in fighting in the northern Gaza Strip. The overall number of Israeli military deaths has risen to 403 since ground operations began in Gaza, launched in response to Hamas's October 7, 2023, attacks. The soldiers were involved in combat at the time of their death. During that exchange, one officer and a reservist soldier sustained critical injuries. Both injured have since been evacuated to the hospital. IDF is investigating the details surrounding the incident. The IDF has continued its ground offensive in the Gaza Strip, targeting Hamas militants and infrastructure. The military claims to have killed more than 17,000 militants in the current conflict, though these numbers have not been independently verified. The situation remains extremely volatile, with heavy casualties on both sides. Simultaneous with the military action, diplomatic efforts are proceeding pari passu to establish a cease-fire. Mr. Netanyahu has sent Mossad Director David Barnea for indirect talks with Hamas in Qatar in the hope that there might be movement in negotiations. Brokered by the United States, Egypt, and Qatar, negotiations now focus on the phase-by-phase cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas. Humanitarian Impact The war has become a catastrophe for civilians in the region. The Gaza Health Ministry reports more than 46,000 Palestinian deaths, mostly women and children, since hostilities began. The humanitarian situation is worsening, with large-scale displacement and infrastructure destruction further increasing the misery of the civilian population. The killings of the four Israeli soldiers make quite clear the human cost of continued conflict in Gaza. As military operations continue alongside diplomatic negotiations, the international community looks on with high hopes for a resolution that can bring an end to hostilities and alleviate the humanitarian crisis affecting the region.The post Israeli army reports four soldiers killed in north Gaza first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-army-four-soldiers-killed-north-gaza/	2025-01-12T09:47:46-08:00	
UAE to reopen Beirut embassy after talks with Aoun	The United Arab Emirates will reopen its embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, in what would be a significant step toward healing two-way diplomatic relations. This move comes after a meeting between UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati in Abu Dhabi. Background of the Diplomatic Rift In October 2021, the UAE, along with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Bahrain, recalled its diplomats from Lebanon due to critical comments about the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen made by then-Lebanese Information Minister George Kordahi; the move had resulted in strained ties between Lebanon and several Gulf countries. Recent Developments and Agreements During their meeting, President Sheikh Mohamed and Prime Minister Mikati agreed on the measures required for reopening the UAE Embassy in Beirut, and the need to establish a joint committee entrusted with proposing a mechanism for facilitating entry procedures for Lebanese wishing to visit the UAE. His Highness Sheikh Mohamed hoped that Lebanon would enjoy stability, security, and prosperity and reiterated the UAE's steadfast stance regarding the unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Lebanon. The UAE has shown its support to the people of Lebanon for seeing an active Lebanon on the regional and international front and as a coherent and strong country. Implications for Bilateral Relations The reopening of the embassy and the facilitation of visa processes mark a positive shift in UAE-Lebanon relations. This means both parties are on the same page in their commitment to strengthen ties in various fields of development and economy for the service of both countries' interests. Prime Minister Mikati also thanked the UAE for its continued support, which he described as having had positive effects on the Lebanese people. The reopening of the UAE Embassy in Beirut represents a pivotal moment in restoring diplomatic relations between the UAE and Lebanon. This development is expected to enhance cooperation and foster stronger bilateral ties, contributing to regional stability and prosperity.The post UAE to reopen Beirut embassy after talks with Aoun first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/uae-reopen-beirut-embassy-talks-aoun/	2025-01-12T09:47:38-08:00	
Syria claims foiling Islamic State attack on Sayyida Zeinab shrin...	Syrian intelligence under the country’s new leadership has reportedly foiled a plot by the Islamic State (IS) to bomb the Shiite shrine of Sayyida Zeinab in a Damascus suburb. State media announced the arrests of individuals involved in the plan, attributing the information to an unnamed official from the General Intelligence Service. According to the official, the intelligence agency is fully committed to countering any threats targeting the diverse population of Syria. The Sayyida Zeinab shrine has previously been a target for IS attacks, as the group, adhering to an extreme interpretation of Sunni Islam, views Shiites as heretics. A notable attack occurred in 2023 when a motorcycle bomb exploded at the shrine, killing six people and injuring dozens on the eve of the Shiite holy day of Ashoura. The announcement of this foiled attack seems intended to reassure Syria’s religious minorities, many of whom supported the former government of Bashar al-Assad. Assad, an Alawite minority leader, was aligned with Iran, the Shiite Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, and Iraqi militias backed by Iran. The current de facto government, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), emerged as the ruling party after leading an offensive that overthrew Assad last month. Previously affiliated with al-Qaida, HTS is a Sunni Islamist group that has since severed those ties. Its leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, has emphasized the importance of religious coexistence since taking control in Damascus.The post Syria claims foiling Islamic State attack on Sayyida Zeinab shrine first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/syria-foiling-islamic-state-attack-zeinab-shrine/	2025-01-11T10:10:21-08:00	
Aoun urges swift government formation to set things right	President Joseph Aoun emphasized on Saturday that his mission is not centered around engaging in politics but on establishing a functional and equitable state. During a meeting with Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdul Latif Daryan in Baabda, Aoun highlighted that such a state can only thrive when built on fairness and equality among all its components, unified under a single national identity. He stressed that no group should emerge as a victor or a loser, citing the recent conflict between Israel and Hezbollah as a reminder that damage affects everyone. He expressed concern over the hardships endured by the Lebanese people, emphasizing that the nation has endured enough suffering. Aoun called for collective efforts, noting that this is a critical opportunity for the country to either succeed or fail, and success requires unity and cooperation. Aoun also underlined the urgency of forming a new government promptly to steer the country in the right direction and restore international trust. He urged the Lebanese to leverage foreign aid constructively rather than using it as a tool to intimidate one another. The president reiterated the importance of equality among all Lebanese citizens, stating that no sect or individual holds superiority over another. He emphasized unity under one flag and one national identity, declaring that while the right to hold differing opinions is fundamental, fostering disputes is unacceptable.The post Aoun urges swift government formation to set things right first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/aoun-swift-government-formation/	2025-01-11T10:10:14-08:00	
Los Angeles probes fire cause as curfew takes effect	Californians are demanding accountability for the destruction caused by the Los Angeles wildfires, as authorities enforce a strict nighttime curfew to prevent looting and chaos. The fires have claimed at least 11 lives, reduced thousands of homes to ash, and left many residents devastated, with President Joe Biden comparing the scene to a war zone. Frustration is mounting over the preparedness and response of officials, particularly regarding false evacuation alerts and a lack of water for firefighters during the critical early stages. Governor Gavin Newsom has called for an independent review of the city’s utilities, describing the water shortages as deeply concerning and demanding answers. Residents, like Pacific Palisades homeowner Nicole Perri, expressed anger, accusing officials of failing them. In Altadena, Nicholas Norman echoed similar sentiments, accusing authorities of abandoning ordinary people to their fate. Late Friday, a flare-up forced additional evacuations from high-profile neighborhoods, including areas near the Getty Center, which houses priceless art and was designed with fire-resistant materials. As the risk of looting grows, a curfew from sunset to sunrise has been implemented in affected areas. The Los Angeles Police Department has already made around two dozen arrests, and violators face penalties of up to six months in jail or $1,000 in fines. The National Guard has been called in to assist local law enforcement. The fires, spanning five separate blazes, have consumed more than 37,000 acres and destroyed approximately 10,000 buildings, according to California’s fire agency. Firefighters have been battling around the clock, with some progress reported. In Pacific Palisades and Malibu, the largest blaze is now 8% contained, while the Eaton Fire near Altadena is at 3% containment. A third fire near Hidden Hills, home to several celebrities, is 50% contained. Despite these gains, officials warn that the situation remains perilous, with strong winds expected to return in the coming days. Celebrities have also been affected by the devastation. Actor Mel Gibson revealed that his Malibu home was destroyed, describing the loss as heartbreaking. The causes of the fires are still under investigation. Meanwhile, Biden criticized misinformation being spread about the blazes, indirectly addressing incoming president Donald Trump. Governor Newsom, who has faced criticism from Trump, extended an invitation for the president-elect to visit Los Angeles and witness the destruction firsthand. Newsom called for unity, urging leaders to avoid politicizing the tragedy. Experts highlight the role of climate change in intensifying wildfire risks, with dry conditions following two wet years leaving large amounts of fuel ready to ignite. Additionally, emergency managers have faced backlash for mistakenly issuing false evacuation alerts to millions, causing widespread panic. Officials apologized for the error, with Los Angeles fire chief Kristin Crowley citing chronic understaffing and budget constraints as significant challenges. Despite the temporary lull in winds, the battle against the fires continues, and officials emphasize the need for vigilance as the region faces ongoing threats.The post Los Angeles probes fire cause as curfew takes effect first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/los-angeles-probes-fire-cause-curfew-effect/	2025-01-11T10:10:04-08:00	
Russia targets Libya as new Africa launchpad	The collapse of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria, a long-standing ally of Russia, has upended the Kremlin's strategy across the Mediterranean and Africa. This shift is forcing Moscow to redirect its focus toward Libya as a potential new stronghold, according to experts. Russia's military operations in the Mediterranean, Middle East, and sub-Saharan Africa relied heavily on its bases along the Syrian coast. With Assad’s sudden removal from power, this strategic setup faces significant disruption. Although Syria's new leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has signaled a desire to maintain relations with Russia, the political reshuffling in Syria is compelling Moscow to pivot its attention to Libya. In Libya, Russian mercenaries are already supporting Khalifa Haftar, who controls the country’s east, in opposition to the UN-recognized Government of National Unity (GNU) in Tripoli, which is backed by Turkey. This realignment is a defensive move to secure Russia's ongoing military and political operations in Africa, explained Jalel Harchaoui from the RUSI think tank in the UK. It reflects Russia’s effort to adapt to its declining influence in Syria. Russian activities in Libya have grown significantly. Reports from the investigative group 'All Eyes On Wagner' in May 2024 revealed Russian military operations at multiple Libyan sites, including the strategic port of Tobruk. By mid-2024, Russian troop numbers in Libya had nearly doubled, alongside reports of advanced military equipment being transferred from Syria, including S-300 and S-400 missile defense systems. Since Assad’s fall on December 8, there has been a marked increase in the movement of Russian troops and military resources into Libya. Ukrainian intelligence claims that Moscow is using cargo ships to transport arms and equipment into the region, further solidifying its presence. Libya is central to Russia’s strategy to maintain regional influence. Unlike Syria, which provided a stage for Moscow to test military capabilities and challenge NATO’s eastern flank, Libya offers an opportunity to disrupt Western interests and extend influence into Africa. This is particularly evident in Russia’s partnership with Haftar, who serves as a counterweight to the Tripoli-based GNU. However, Russia’s shift to Libya faces significant challenges. Unlike Syria, where Moscow operated with little scrutiny, Libya is more transparent, making it harder for Russian activities to remain concealed. Additionally, Russia must navigate the complex alliances of other influential players, including Turkey, Egypt, and the UAE, all of which are involved in Libya's fractured politics. Efforts to gain a permanent foothold in Tobruk’s port have drawn concern from the Tripoli government, Italy, NATO, and the EU. The United States has also reportedly pressured Haftar to deny Russia a lasting presence in the area. Despite these challenges, Russia appears determined to pursue its strategy in Libya, using it as a platform to project power across the region. However, experts warn that relying solely on Haftar could repeat the mistakes made in Syria, where Russia’s plans depended heavily on a single leader. As Russia seeks to solidify its position in Libya, it must balance its efforts with a broader contingency plan and navigate the delicate dynamics of Libya's divided political landscape. While Haftar values Russian support, he is unlikely to sever ties with Western allies completely, limiting Moscow's influence in the region.The post Russia targets Libya as new Africa launchpad first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/russia-targets-libya-new-africa-launchpad/	2025-01-11T10:09:52-08:00	
Cyprus president first foreign leader to meet Aoun	Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides has become the first foreign leader to officially visit Lebanon's newly elected President Joseph Aoun. The visit marks the first by a foreign head of state since Aoun, a former Lebanese army commander, was chosen by the Lebanese parliament to fill the presidency after a vacancy of more than two years. The two leaders held discussions at the presidential palace in Baabda, located southeast of Beirut. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Christodoulides emphasized Cyprus’s commitment to Lebanon, stating that his visit was a demonstration of support for Lebanon and its people through actions rather than words. Lebanon and Cyprus share a long history of close ties. Situated less than 200 kilometers apart, Cyprus has historically provided military aid to strengthen Lebanon’s armed forces and served as a refuge for thousands of Lebanese during the country’s civil war from 1975 to 1990. In more recent years, the economic collapse in Lebanon, which began in late 2019, prompted many Lebanese citizens to seek a new life in Cyprus. The two nations have also engaged in extensive discussions regarding border management. These talks have been particularly significant as many Syrian refugees in Lebanon, as well as an increasing number of Lebanese affected by the ongoing economic crisis, have attempted to reach Cyprus by sea aboard smuggler boats.The post Cyprus president first foreign leader to meet Aoun first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/cyprus-president-first-foreign-leader-meet-aoun/	2025-01-10T10:13:02-08:00	
Israeli drone strike kills 5, injures 4 in Tayr Debba	An Israeli drone targeted a van in the town of Tayr Debba in the Tyre district on Friday. According to the Health Ministry, the attack resulted in five fatalities and left four others injured. The Israeli military stated that the strike occurred after individuals were observed loading weapons into a vehicle linked to Hezbollah. The army claimed the operation was aimed at neutralizing the threat posed by the weapons. A fragile ceasefire has been in place since November 27, following over a year of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, which included two months of intense conflict with ground troop involvement. Under the terms of the truce, the Lebanese Army, alongside U.N. peacekeepers, is tasked with deploying in the south as the Israeli military withdraws over a 60-day period, set to conclude on January 26. Hezbollah is required to pull its forces north of the Litani River, approximately 30 kilometers from the border, and dismantle its remaining military infrastructure in southern Lebanon. The impending withdrawal deadline has sparked anxiety among many in Lebanon, who fear the potential for renewed violence. The Israeli military has repeatedly cautioned residents against returning to villages near the border. The U.N. migration agency recently reported that over 120,000 people remain displaced within Lebanon, while Israeli officials stated that around 51,000 people are displaced from northern Israel. Lebanese authorities estimate that since October 2023, more than 4,000 people have died as a result of the conflict, with the majority of fatalities occurring since September of last year, including some after the ceasefire. Both sides have accused each other of violating the agreement and have exchanged warnings in the aftermath of the truce.The post Israeli drone strike kills 5, injures 4 in Tayr Debba first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-drone-strike-kills-5-tayr-debba/	2025-01-10T10:12:53-08:00	
Aoun sets PM consultations for Monday	President Joseph Aoun has announced that binding parliamentary consultations to select a new prime minister will take place on Monday. According to a statement from the Presidency, Aoun will meet with parliamentary blocs and independent MPs from 8:00 a.m. until around 5:30 p.m. Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati has expressed his willingness to lead the next government, with reports indicating he will remain in his position until the upcoming parliamentary elections. Meanwhile, Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea has proposed MP Ashraf Rifi or MP Fouad Makhzoumi as potential candidates for the role. On Thursday, Lebanon's parliament elected Aoun as president, ending a more than two-year presidential vacancy. The vote follows a fragile ceasefire that concluded a 14-month conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. The new president is expected to play a crucial role in securing international aid for Lebanon's reconstruction efforts. Aoun, who is not related to former President Michel Aoun, is widely regarded as the favored candidate of the United States and Saudi Arabia, both of which are key to Lebanon’s plans for recovery and rebuilding. The next government will face significant challenges, including implementing the ceasefire agreement, overseeing reconstruction, and addressing the country's deep economic and financial crisis. Lebanon is now in its sixth year of an economic downturn that has severely devalued its currency and eroded the savings of its citizens. The state electricity company remains underfunded, providing only a few hours of power daily. In 2022, Lebanon reached a preliminary agreement with the International Monetary Fund for a bailout package, but progress on the required reforms to finalize the deal has been minimal.The post Aoun sets PM consultations for Monday first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/aoun-sets-pm-consultations-monday/	2025-01-10T10:12:42-08:00	
Israel targets Yemen Houthis, vows to hunt leaders	Israel conducted airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen on Friday, targeting a power station and coastal ports in retaliation for recent missile and drone attacks. The Israeli military stated that fighter jets hit multiple military sites controlled by the Houthis on Yemen’s western coast and inland regions. The strikes were carried out in response to Houthi-launched missiles and drones aimed at Israel. The military identified key targets, including military infrastructure at the Hizaz power station, a crucial energy source for the Houthis, and facilities in the ports of Hodeida and Ras Issa. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasized that the Houthis were being punished for their continued aggression. He stated that Israel is committed to ensuring the group faces significant consequences for their attacks. Defense Minister Israel Katz warned that Israel would actively pursue the leaders of the Houthi organization. He highlighted the damage inflicted on Houthi-held infrastructure, including paralyzing Hodeida port and setting Ras Issa port ablaze, asserting that no one involved would be immune from retaliation. The Houthis, who control Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, have been launching missiles and drones toward Israel since the outbreak of the Gaza conflict in October 2023. They describe these actions as expressions of solidarity with the people of Gaza. The Iran-backed group has also targeted ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, which has prompted retaliatory strikes by the United States and occasionally Britain. Israel has previously struck Houthi-controlled sites in Yemen, including locations in the capital. According to the Israeli military, the Houthis have launched approximately 40 surface-to-surface missiles toward Israel since the Gaza war began, most of which were intercepted. Additionally, around 320 drones have been launched, with Israeli air defenses intercepting over 100.The post Israel targets Yemen Houthis, vows to hunt leaders first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-targets-yemen-houthis-hunt-leaders/	2025-01-10T10:12:29-08:00	
Berri’s bloc leans toward backing Joseph Aoun	The Development and Liberation Bloc, led by Speaker Nabih Berri, appears to be leaning towards supporting Army Chief Joseph Aoun in Thursday’s presidential election, according to media reports on Wednesday. An-Nahar newspaper reported that the bloc is showing an inclination to back General Joseph Aoun. Meanwhile, sources from the bloc told LBCI television that their earlier statement reaffirmed a commitment to achieving consensus among Lebanese political factions. The sources indicated that if this consensus points toward electing the army commander, the bloc would support it. However, conflicting reports have emerged. Sky News Arabia cited sources suggesting that Berri has not yet provided a definitive response regarding his position or Hezbollah’s stance on Joseph Aoun’s candidacy. Similarly, Radio VDL News (93.3) quoted senior sources stating that claims about the Shiite Duo’s endorsement of Aoun are inaccurate. These sources argued that such reports are attempts to influence various parties and generate momentum around a potential presidential candidate.The post Berri’s bloc leans toward backing Joseph Aoun first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/berris-bloc-leans-backing-joseph-aoun/	2025-01-09T00:11:50-08:00	
US says Israel to withdraw in 15 days, retains strategic hills	According to al-Akhbar newspaper, U.S. mediator Amos Hochstein announced during the most recent ceasefire monitoring committee meeting that Israel would withdraw from south Lebanon's western, central, and eastern sectors within 15 days. The committee’s co-chair, U.S. General Jasper Jeffers, also approved an Israeli plan to maintain control over three strategic hills within Lebanese territory. Sources familiar with the plan revealed that the withdrawal would occur in three phases. During the first five days, Israeli forces would pull out from the western sector, spanning from Ras al-Naqoura to Rmeish. The next five days would see a withdrawal from the central sector, covering Rmeish to Mays al-Jabal. Finally, the eastern sector, from Mays al-Jabal to Shebaa, would be vacated in the last five days. Despite the withdrawal, Israel intends to establish military bases on three key hills within Lebanon, according to the report. These hills include the al-Labbouneh forest near Naqoura and Alma al-Shaab, the Blat mountain situated between Marwahin, Ramyeh, Beit Leef, and Qawzah, and the al-Hamamis hill between the plains of Khiam and al-Wazzani. The strategic locations of these hills allow Israel to monitor vast areas south of the Litani River. They overlook the Israeli settlements of Western Galilee, Zar’it, Shtula, and Metula. The uninhabited nature of these hills, which lack any structures, provides Israel with the ability to maneuver quickly into Lebanese territory if necessary, the sources added.The post US says Israel to withdraw in 15 days, retains strategic hills first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-israel-withdraw-15-days-retains-hills/	2025-01-09T00:11:42-08:00	
US redirects $100m military aid to Lebanon to support ceasefire	In its final days, the Biden administration has redirected over $100 million in military aid originally allocated to Israel and Egypt, shifting the funds to Lebanon to support a ceasefire agreement brokered between Israel and Hezbollah. According to State Department notifications sent to Congress on January 3 and later obtained by The Associated Press, $95 million intended for Egypt and $7.5 million earmarked for Israel will now aid Lebanon’s military and government. The majority of the redirected funds will support the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF), which play a critical role in implementing the November ceasefire agreement. The funding will help the LAF deploy to southern Lebanon, complementing the efforts of the U.N. peacekeeping mission patrolling the Blue Line, the border demarcation established after the 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. The State Department emphasized the importance of strengthening the LAF to ensure the success of the ceasefire and maintain Lebanon’s territorial integrity. Both Israel and Hezbollah have agreed to withdraw their forces from southern Lebanon by the end of January, with compliance overseen by the LAF and U.N. peacekeepers. The department highlighted that U.S. assistance enhances the LAF’s capacity as Lebanon’s only legitimate military force, helping it counter destabilizing threats from ISIS and other terrorist groups while providing security for Lebanese citizens and U.S. personnel. The notifications also addressed concerns from critics who allege Hezbollah’s influence within the LAF, stating that U.S. support bolsters the LAF as a counterweight to Hezbollah and affirming the LAF’s status as an independent, non-sectarian institution respected across Lebanon’s diverse communities. In addition to military aid, $15 million will be allocated to Lebanon’s Internal Security Forces (ISF) to help them serve as the country’s primary law enforcement body and support the LAF in maintaining control in southern Lebanon. This funding will be used to rebuild police stations, upgrade communication systems, and acquire new vehicles. The administration also announced smaller allocations of $3.06 million to the Palestinian Authority police to assist operations in the West Bank and $2.5 million to Jordan’s Public Security Directorate to enhance its response to public demonstrations.The post US redirects $100m military aid to Lebanon to support ceasefire first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-100m-military-aid-lebanon-support-ceasefire/	2025-01-08T06:39:01-08:00	
Opposition backs Aoun from Maarab as Saudi envoy pushes election	The opposition is set to convene a meeting in Maarab at 7:00 PM to officially declare its support for Army Chief Joseph Aoun's candidacy for Lebanon's presidency, according to media reports on Wednesday. This announcement comes ahead of the presidential election session scheduled by Speaker Nabih Berri. In related developments, Saudi envoy Yazid bin Mohammad arrived in Beirut on Wednesday morning to engage in political discussions aimed at facilitating Aoun's election as president, media sources indicated. Meanwhile, Al-Jadeed television reported late Tuesday on ongoing discussions involving key political figures. Talks were held between Free Patriotic Movement leader Jebran Bassil and Hezbollah official Wafiq Safa, as well as a separate, 'secret' meeting between Bassil and Berri. During his meeting with Berri, Bassil reportedly expressed a preference for selecting a candidate aligned with the international community. He proposed former ministers Jihad Azour and Ziad Baroud as potential options, according to Al-Jadeed.The post Opposition backs Aoun from Maarab as Saudi envoy pushes election first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/opposition-backs-aoun-maarab/	2025-01-08T06:38:55-08:00	
Le Drian lands in Lebanon to tackle political deadlock	France’s special envoy to Lebanon, Jean-Yves Le Drian, held a meeting in Beirut on Wednesday with Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri as part of his efforts to help Lebanon resolve its prolonged presidential vacancy. The presidency has remained unfilled for over two years due to deep political and sectarian divisions. Lebanon’s parliament is set to convene on Thursday to elect a president, and Le Drian will attend the session at Berri’s invitation. His visit is part of broader international efforts to facilitate the election, in line with the principles established during the Doha meeting in July 2023. Le Drian is collaborating with representatives of the Quintet — France, the United States, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt — to break the political deadlock. In a statement, Le Drian called on Lebanese lawmakers to find common ground, stressing that electing a president is a critical first step toward reactivating Lebanon’s institutions and restoring its sovereignty. Reports from local media suggest that Le Drian is advocating for the election of Army Chief Joseph Aoun, a leading candidate, ahead of Thursday’s parliamentary session. The evolving political dynamics in Lebanon have added uncertainty to the situation. Hezbollah, a significant force in Lebanese politics, has faced setbacks in recent months following its conflict with Israel, which resulted in the deaths of key officials, including its longtime leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. Compounding this is the fall of President Bashar Assad’s government in Syria, a longtime ally of Hezbollah. The vacancy in Lebanon’s presidency has persisted since October 2022, when former President Michel Aoun, a close ally of the Iran-backed Hezbollah, completed his term.The post Le Drian lands in Lebanon to tackle political deadlock first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/le-drian-lands-lebanon-political-deadlock/	2025-01-08T06:38:44-08:00	
Shiite Duo’s position on Joseph Aoun’s election revealed	Hezbollah and the Amal Movement remain opposed to the nomination of Army Chief Joseph Aoun for Lebanon's presidency, according to a report by al-Jadeed TV on Wednesday. The Shiite Duo maintains its position that electing Aoun would require a constitutional amendment, which they firmly oppose. Their sources reiterated that their primary choice for the presidency remains Suleiman Franjieh, while they are open to considering other candidates, including Major General Elias al-Bayssari. However, they emphasized that they would not support a president whose election would violate the constitution or compromise national sovereignty, indirectly referencing Aoun. According to the Lebanese constitution, senior civil servants, such as Aoun, must vacate their positions at least six months before being eligible for the presidency. The report also noted that Hezbollah and Amal continue to hold discussions and coordinate with the Free Patriotic Movement. However, they will not officially announce their candidate before the presidential election session. Later in the day, al-Jadeed reported that MP Mohammad Raad from Hezbollah conveyed to French envoy Jean-Yves Le Drian that Hezbollah would not obstruct a broad Lebanese consensus on a presidential candidate.The post Shiite Duo’s position on Joseph Aoun’s election revealed first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/shiite-duos-position-joseph-aouns-election-revealed/	2025-01-08T06:38:36-08:00	
Bassil declares votes for Aoun as spoiled	Lebanese lawmakers are set to vote for a new president on Thursday, but divisions persist among political factions regarding the leading candidate, Army Chief Joseph Aoun. Aoun appears to have the backing of international powers, including the United States, France, and Saudi Arabia, but faces resistance from some domestic parties. The Free Patriotic Movement (FPM), led by Jebran Bassil, has not officially declared its candidate. Bassil has argued that electing Aoun would violate the constitution, stating in an interview with LBCI that any vote for Aoun in the January 9 session should be considered invalid. Instead, he has expressed support for former finance minister and International Monetary Fund official Jihad Azour, as well as acting security chief Elias Baissari. Bassil emphasized that when the FPM proposed Azour over a year ago, he was not intended as a confrontational candidate. However, Hezbollah dismissed Azour as a 'confrontation and challenge candidate' after the FPM and opposition reached an agreement on his name. Bassil called for greater flexibility from Amal and Hezbollah, urging them to build consensus with other parties, including the Lebanese Forces (LF). The LF has yet to officially nominate a candidate, though its leader, Samir Geagea, has expressed a willingness to consider supporting Aoun if Hezbollah and Amal formally endorse him. Geagea, who has previously hinted at running for president himself, remains undecided. Aoun has received backing from several factions, including the Kataeb party, independent MPs, and the Democratic Gathering bloc of the Progressive Socialist Party (PSP). However, Hezbollah and Amal remain hesitant to support his candidacy. Reports suggest that their preferred candidate will not be announced until the voting session. While Hezbollah has reportedly vetoed Geagea, they have not ruled out Aoun. Meanwhile, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a key Hezbollah ally, has opposed any constitutional amendments that might facilitate Aoun's election. The Lebanese constitution states that presidential candidates must not have held high public office within the past two years, a provision that could disqualify Aoun. If elected, Aoun would become Lebanon's fifth army commander to assume the presidency and the fourth consecutive one to do so.The post Bassil declares votes for Aoun as spoiled first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/bassil-votes-aoun-spoiled/	2025-01-08T06:38:21-08:00	
Hochstein confirms Israeli forces start Naqoura pullout	U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein announced that Israeli forces began withdrawing from a border town in southern Lebanon on Monday, marking another step in the ongoing ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. This withdrawal, the second since the ceasefire began on November 27, follows calls from United Nations peacekeepers and Lebanon’s prime minister for Israel to expedite its exit from southern Lebanon. Hochstein confirmed that Israeli troops have started pulling back from Naqoura, a town near the U.N.-demarcated Blue Line, and returning to Israeli territory. He emphasized that the withdrawals would continue until all Israeli forces leave Lebanon, while the Lebanese Army takes over security responsibilities in coordination with U.N. peacekeepers. Following meetings with Speaker Nabih Berri and caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati, Hochstein expressed confidence that all parties would uphold their commitments to the ceasefire agreement, despite mutual accusations from Israel and Hezbollah of violating the terms. However, he did not confirm whether the withdrawal would be completed within the 60-day timeframe stipulated in the ceasefire. Hochstein noted that there are still 20 days left in the ceasefire period and pledged to continue efforts to ensure the withdrawal and deployment process remains on track. The agreement, which Hochstein helped negotiate, requires the Lebanese Army and United Nations peacekeepers to deploy in southern Lebanon as Israeli forces withdraw. Hezbollah is also obligated to move its forces north of the Litani River and dismantle any remaining military infrastructure in the area. Prime Minister Mikati reiterated the need for a clear timeline to complete the withdrawal by the deadline, rejecting any notion of extending the ceasefire period. The Lebanese Army confirmed its deployment around Naqoura in coordination with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) as Israeli troops vacated the area. The withdrawal and deployment coincided with a meeting of the five-member committee overseeing the ceasefire, which includes representatives from Israel, Lebanon, France, the United States, and UNIFIL. Hochstein co-chaired the meeting alongside U.S. Major General Jasper Jeffers, stating that the mechanism for managing the ceasefire is functioning effectively. While progress may not have been as swift as some had hoped, Hochstein expressed optimism after observing developments in Naqoura. Tensions remain, however, with Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz accusing Hezbollah of failing to comply with the ceasefire terms, including withdrawing north of the Litani River. Hezbollah has similarly accused Israel of violations. Earlier in December, the Lebanese Army deployed around Khiam following an Israeli troop withdrawal, marking the first such transition under the ceasefire agreement. During his visit, Hochstein also addressed Lebanon’s political situation, urging leaders to reach a consensus ahead of an upcoming presidential election. Lebanon has been without a president for over two years due to political divisions between Hezbollah and its rivals. Hochstein emphasized the importance of unity to implement reforms, rebuild the economy, and attract investment, presenting the moment as a critical opportunity for the Lebanese people. Hochstein and Jeffers also met with Lebanese Army Commander Joseph Aoun to discuss the ceasefire. Aoun, whose name has been mentioned as a potential presidential candidate, remains a key figure in the country’s security and political landscape.The post Hochstein confirms Israeli forces start Naqoura pullout first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hochstein-confirms-israeli-forces-naqoura-pullout/	2025-01-07T11:24:13-08:00	
Jumblat backs Aoun, rejects peace with Israel	Druze leader Walid Jumblat reaffirmed his support for Army Commander General Joseph Aoun as his bloc's candidate for Lebanon's presidency, noting that the nomination has received favorable responses from the five-nation group focused on Lebanon's situation. Jumblat emphasized the urgency of electing a president in the first round, warning against delaying the election until after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. He argued that postponement could lead to uncertainty, which the country cannot afford. He stated that General Aoun’s candidacy represents an opportunity, and if his election fails, there is no viable alternative. Commenting on the recent Israeli conflict with Lebanon, Jumblat acknowledged that Hezbollah was not defeated and expressed respect for the martyrs. However, he pointed out internal challenges within Hezbollah and urged acceptance of the new realities. He rejected recent remarks by Hezbollah figures Sheikh Naim Qassem and Wafiq Safa, instead advocating for strengthening and fortifying the state. Jumblat suggested that Hezbollah fighters could be integrated into the Lebanese army. Jumblat also expressed concerns about ongoing Israeli violations, suggesting that Israel might aim to create a new buffer zone in southern Lebanon. He highlighted the importance of leveraging the presence of U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, warning of Israel’s ambitions, particularly regarding the Litani River’s waters. He acknowledged Iran’s continued support for Hezbollah, providing available resources, but noted that these capabilities are no match for U.S. technology. Despite this, Jumblat reiterated his firm stance against peace with Israel, stating his opposition both now and for future generations. Jumblat revealed that he had previously urged Hezbollah, through messages, to avoid involvement in the conflict. While there is currently no contact with Wafiq Safa, Jumblat mentioned he is open to meeting him and noted no ongoing relationship with Sheikh Naim Qassem. The Druze leader called on Hezbollah to transition into a political party, stressing that Lebanon has endured enough wars and must prioritize stability for the benefit of future generations.

US and French generals inspect 5th Brigade ops in the south	U.S. Major General Jasper Jeffers, Chairman of the Cessation of Hostilities Implementation Mechanism, accompanied by French Brigadier General Guillaume Ponchin, visited the headquarters of the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) 5th Brigade in southwest Lebanon on Tuesday morning, according to a statement from the U.S. Embassy. The 5th Brigade's headquarters is located approximately five kilometers northeast of Naqoura, a town recently placed under LAF control following the initial phase of the Israeli forces' withdrawal on January 6.
