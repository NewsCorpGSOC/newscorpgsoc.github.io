Lebanese Freed After 33 Years in Syrian Prisons	A Lebanese man who had spent 33 years in Syrian prisons arrived in his hometown of Chekka on Monday, following his release by Islamist-led rebels. Salim Hamawi became the first Lebanese prisoner to return to Lebanon, although another man, Ali al-Ali, was filmed after being freed from a prison in Hama last week. Ali had been missing for almost 40 years during Lebanon’s civil war. His family had no contact with him, and a Syrian journalist in Hama reported that Ali had lost all memory and could not recognize his own identity. Hamawi, speaking upon his return to Lebanon, explained that he had been arrested for his affiliation with the Christian Lebanese Forces party. He shared that he had lost all hope of ever returning home. Following the release of Ali al-Ali’s video online on Thursday, many Lebanese families began calling for answers about the fate of their relatives who are believed to be detained in Syrian prisons. During Lebanon’s 15-year civil war, approximately 17,000 people went missing, many of whom were either imprisoned or killed in detention centers run by Syrian forces in Lebanon and Syria. The whereabouts of many of these individuals remain uncertain.The post Lebanese Freed After 33 Years in Syrian Prisons first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lebanese-freed-33-years-syrian-prisons/	2024-12-10T01:00:15-08:00	
Watch: Meet Abu Mohammed al-Jolani: The New Face of Post-Assad Sy...	Analysis of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham Leader and His Role in Toppling Assad The recent ousting of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has led to a critical inquiry: who now represents the Syrian populace after decades of oppressive rule? A notable contender for this role is Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), spearheaded by Abu Mohammad al-Jolani. This group played a crucial part in the opposition’s efforts that culminated in Assad’s downfall. Origins and Evolution of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham Hayat Tahrir al-Sham emerged in the early days of the Syrian civil war, which began in 2011 as a widespread uprising against Assad’s authoritarian regime. Initially, HTS was an offshoot of the Nusra Front, the official al-Qaida affiliate in Syria. The group was known for its military prowess and commitment to global jihad, with the aim of establishing strict Islamic rule across the Muslim world. In 2016, the Nusra Front publicly cut ties with al-Qaida and rebranded itself as Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, meaning 'Front for the Conquest of the Levant.' The following year, it merged with several other factions to form Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or the 'Organization for the Liberation of the Levant.' This rebranding was an effort to distance itself from al-Qaida’s global jihadist agenda and to focus more on issues specific to Syrians, such as local governance, economic concerns, and humanitarian aid. Despite these changes, HTS’s core ideology remains rooted in jihadism, with the primary goal of overthrowing the Assad regime and establishing Islamic rule in Syria. Abu Mohammad al-Jolani: A Key Figure Born Ahmed al-Sharaa in 1982 in Saudi Arabia, al-Jolani relocated to Damascus with his family in 1989. His jihadist career began in Iraq following the 2003 US-led invasion, where he joined forces aligned with al-Qaida. In 2011, under the direction of then-al-Qaida in Iraq leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, al-Jolani was tasked with establishing the Nusra Front in Syria, which quickly became a significant force in the civil war. Under al-Jolani’s leadership, HTS has sought to present itself as more pragmatic, focusing on governance issues in Idlib, Syria’s largest rebel stronghold. This shift has been part of al-Jolani’s effort to transition from a jihadist leader to a more politically viable figure in Syrian politics. Al-Jolani’s pragmatic approach since 2017 has been crucial in helping HTS control territories and assert itself as a regional governing force. His recent actions, such as adopting a moderate persona and engaging in public services, reflect his central role in HTS’s military and political evolution, reinforcing the group’s hold on power and efforts to gain legitimacy both locally and internationally. HTS’s Rise to Power in Syria HTS has maintained control over its territories by implementing governance systems that provide stability and services, legitimizing its rule in the eyes of local populations. The group aimed to expand its influence and win international acceptance by minimizing opposition and collaborating with the broader Syrian revolutionary movement. This involved working with other actors in Syria to present a united front appealing to international observers and potential allies. Since 2017, HTS has dominated Idlib, the last major stronghold for various rebel groups after government forces retook Aleppo in December 2016. Over the years, HTS has solidified its control by functioning as a quasi-governmental entity, offering civil services and overseeing local affairs, such as highway control and commercial trucking duties, despite reports of human rights abuses. HTS’s propaganda has increasingly emphasized protecting Syrian territory and its people from Assad’s government, enhancing its standing among local communities and other rebel groups. To further improve its image, HTS has ramped up public relations efforts, both domestically and internationally. This includes engaging with international media and humanitarian organizations to negotiate and document aid deliveries, helping to position HTS as a defender of Sunni Muslim interests.

Israel Hits Former Syrian Army Sites in New Strikes	Israel carried out strikes on Monday targeting positions held by the ousted Syrian government's army in various locations, including Damascus, the south, and the coast, according to a war monitor. These strikes are part of a series of attacks that have occurred since rebels took control the day before. Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported that the Israeli strikes targeted military sites, including weapons depots containing anti-tank missiles and anti-aircraft weapons. He added that Israel is intentionally destroying anything it considers a threat. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar stated on Monday that Israel has attacked strategic weapons systems, including chemical weapons, long-range missiles, and rockets, to prevent them from falling into the hands of extremists.The post Israel Hits Former Syrian Army Sites in New Strikes first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-hits-former-syrian-army-sites-new-strikes/	2024-12-10T00:59:50-08:00	
Assad Fleeing to Moscow After Damascus Falls	After a surprise rebel advance in Syria, Bashar al-Assad fled to Moscow, receiving asylum from Russia, his long-time ally. The rebels’ rapid success in capturing Damascus marked the end of Assad's 50-year regime, which had been characterized by heavy control and repression. Thousands of Syrians celebrated in the streets, waving flags and firing guns, recalling the early days of the Arab Spring. The U.S. expressed support for the rebels, with President Biden noting that the shift in power had changed the Middle East balance. However, the situation remains uncertain, as the future of Syria and its region is still unclear. In the midst of these developments, Russia called for a U.N. Security Council meeting to discuss the unfolding events. Assad’s departure followed negotiations with rebel groups, where it was agreed that power would be peacefully transferred. The rebel leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani, who commands Syria's largest insurgent group, has positioned himself as a key figure in the country's future. Despite past ties to al-Qaida, he has distanced himself from the group and advocates for a pluralistic Syria. The rebellion faces immense challenges, as the country remains divided, with Turkey-backed forces clashing with Kurdish groups and remnants of ISIS still active. Rebels have promised to respect all ethnic and religious groups, but concerns over possible reprisals remain. In Damascus, celebrations erupted, with people chanting anti-Assad slogans and looting government buildings. Internationally, Iran and Russia have distanced themselves from Assad as their support has waned. Iran has called for a peaceful resolution and a transition to a new government, with U.N. officials calling for an orderly political transition. Meanwhile, Israel has seized a buffer zone in the Golan Heights, citing security concerns as Syria’s military withdrew from positions there. The situation is fluid, with many countries, including Qatar and the U.N., seeking ways to ensure stability and a peaceful future for Syria amidst the chaos.The post Assad Fleeing to Moscow After Damascus Falls first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/assad-moscow-damascus-falls/	2024-12-09T06:14:48-08:00	
Israeli Strike in Bint Jbeil Kills 1, Injures 4 Troops	The Lebanese Army reported that one person was killed and four soldiers injured on Monday in an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon, where a fragile ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel has been in place since last month. According to the Army, Israeli forces targeted a car near the Saf al-Hawa/Bint Jbeil military checkpoint, resulting in the death of a civilian and light injuries to four soldiers. The National News Agency confirmed that enemy aircraft struck the vehicle on the Saf al-Hawa road near an army checkpoint. The Israeli military stated that on Sunday, it attacked Hezbollah militants at a weapons storage facility in southern Lebanon, accusing them of violating the ceasefire. The military claimed these militants had orchestrated and carried out attacks against Israeli forces and civilians in recent months, and that several Hezbollah fighters had been targeted in the past 24 hours. Israel had intensified its operations in southern Lebanon in late September, following a year of border skirmishes initiated by Hezbollah in support of Hamas after the Palestinian group's attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023. A ceasefire agreement took effect on November 27, and while it has mostly held, both sides have accused each other of violating the truce. As part of the ceasefire agreement, the Lebanese Army and UN peacekeepers are expected to take over security in southern Lebanon while Israeli forces withdraw over 60 days. Hezbollah is also supposed to move its forces north of the Litani River, approximately 30 kilometers from the border, and dismantle its military infrastructure in southern Lebanon. Israel has issued repeated warnings to Lebanese civilians, advising them to avoid border areas, with another warning issued on Monday. The previous Monday, Israeli airstrikes in southern Lebanon resulted in 11 deaths, according to Lebanon’s health ministry, following Hezbollah’s claim of its first attack on an Israeli position since the ceasefire began. The same day, a Lebanese soldier was injured in an Israeli strike in the eastern Hermel region. Lebanese Health Minister Firas Abiad reported on Wednesday that the death toll from the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah had reached 4,047, with most casualties occurring since the escalation in September, including 316 children. On Tuesday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz warned that if the war resumes, Israel would act with greater force and penetrate deeper into Lebanon, stating that no immunity would be granted to the Lebanese state, which has not been directly involved in the conflict.The post Israeli Strike in Bint Jbeil Kills 1, Injures 4 Troops first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strike-bint-jbeil-kills-1-injures-4-troops/	2024-12-09T06:14:34-08:00	
Syria PM: Government Stands Amid Growing Challenges	Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali, who remained in office following the sudden disappearance of President Bashar al-Assad and many senior officials, is working to guide Syria through a transitional phase. He emphasized efforts to ensure the transition is swift and smooth, noting improvements in security and the formation of a new government. Jalali also confirmed that his administration is in communication with rebel factions and expressed his willingness to meet with opposition leaders, such as Ahmad al-Sharaa, a prominent rebel figure. Syria’s transition has seen bureaucrats and officials previously loyal to the Assad regime quickly adapting to the new political climate. For instance, Judge Khitam Haddad from the Justice Ministry expressed readiness to return to work, aiming to contribute to the rebuilding of the country. Haddad emphasized the importance of justice and fairness in the new Syria. In the midst of this upheaval, there have been reports of a high-ranking Assad ally’s death. Major General Ali Mahmoud, a senior aide to Assad’s brother, Maher, was found dead in his office in Damascus. The exact cause of death remains unclear, with some speculating it may have been either a suicide or a targeted killing. The situation in Syria remains fluid, with many key figures of the Assad regime now either absent or facing significant challenges. Jalali’s comments reflect the precarious nature of the country’s future as the nation grapples with a new order following years of brutal civil war.The post Syria PM: Government Stands Amid Growing Challenges first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/syria-pm-government-stands-growing-challenges/	2024-12-09T06:14:23-08:00	
Israel Calls Syria Buffer Zone Takeover a ‘Temporary Step’	Israel recently deployed forces into the demilitarized buffer zone along its northern border with Syria, following significant shifts in the region. As Syrian rebels, including the group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, made rapid advances and seized areas from President Bashar al-Assad's regime, Israel's military intervened to secure the buffer zone near the Golan Heights. The Israeli military emphasized that this was a temporary measure to protect Israeli citizens and prevent armed groups from crossing into Israeli-controlled territories. Despite this action, Israel clarified that it is not involved in Syria's internal conflict.The post Israel Calls Syria Buffer Zone Takeover a ‘Temporary Step’ first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-calls-syria-buffer-zone-takeover-temporary-step/	2024-12-09T06:14:10-08:00	
Four Israeli Soldiers Killed in South Lebanon Tunnel Collapse	On December 9, 2024, four Israeli soldiers were tragically killed in a collapse while engaging in military operations in southern Lebanon. The soldiers, who were reservists, were involved in a conflict with Hezbollah militants in the region. The incident occurred amidst ongoing tensions and military actions between Israel and Hezbollah forces, who are active in southern Lebanon and have been involved in numerous skirmishes since the outbreak of the latest hostilities. The collapse reportedly took place within a tunnel system that Israeli forces were targeting during their mission to dismantle Hezbollah's infrastructure. The soldiers were among several IDF personnel participating in the operation, which aimed to counter Hezbollah's activities along Israel's northern border. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed the deaths, which have raised concerns about the escalating conflict in southern Lebanon. This tragic event highlights the dangers faced by soldiers engaged in complex operations in hostile territories, particularly in regions with entrenched military infrastructure like tunnels used by Hezbollah. The death of these soldiers further intensifies the already volatile situation along the Israel-Lebanon border. Both Israel and Hezbollah have been preparing for additional clashes, especially as the political and military dynamics in the broader region continue to evolve. The incident serves as a grim reminder of the risks involved in the ongoing conflict and the challenges that the IDF faces in attempting to neutralize threats from Hezbollah, who maintain a significant presence in southern Lebanon. This loss underscores the perilous nature of military engagements in areas with heavy fortifications and tunnel networks. As investigations continue, both local and international communities will be closely monitoring the impact of this tragedy on the broader geopolitical situation.The post Four Israeli Soldiers Killed in South Lebanon Tunnel Collapse first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/four-israeli-soldiers-killed-south-lebanon-tunnel-collapse/	2024-12-09T06:13:57-08:00	
Geagea Rejects Hezbollah Arms, Threatens Political Overhaul	Samir Geagea, leader of the Lebanese Forces, expressed his congratulations to the Lebanese people following the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria. He emphasized that for the past five decades, the Assad family rule had been the primary obstacle to establishing a stable state in Lebanon. Geagea noted that no matter what comes next in Syria, it would not be worse than the current regime under Bashar al-Assad. In a recent interview, Geagea stressed that Lebanon's government must take immediate action to fulfill its commitments, including implementing the ceasefire agreement that was reached on November 27, 2024. He also called for the parliament to carry out its duties effectively. Regarding the potential threat from Syrian rebel groups, Geagea asserted that Lebanon's state institutions must act to protect the country, asserting that the Lebanese Army is more than capable of defending its borders against any such threats. He dismissed the idea of Syrian groups launching an attack on Lebanon, pointing out that no such intention had been expressed. When asked whom he would reach out to in light of Assad's fall, Geagea mentioned Hezbollah’s deputy leader, Sheikh Naim Qassem. He suggested that the time had come for all Lebanese factions to prioritize the establishment of a functional state. Geagea stressed that Lebanon must not revert to its previous conditions and urged Hezbollah to disarm and work toward building a proper state. Geagea made it clear that if Hezbollah refused to cooperate, the government must enforce the ceasefire agreement. He warned that failure to do so would lead to a reevaluation of the situation, as the current state of affairs is unsustainable. The LF leader emphasized that Lebanon cannot continue to function as it has, with people leaving the country due to a party’s refusal to relinquish its weapons.The post Geagea Rejects Hezbollah Arms, Threatens Political Overhaul first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/geagea-rejects-hezbollah-arms-threatens-political-overhaul/	2024-12-09T06:13:44-08:00	
Russia Claims Assad Leaves Syria, Orders Peaceful Power Transfer	Russia's Foreign Ministry announced on Sunday that Bashar al-Assad had left Syria following discussions with rebel groups, and had issued instructions for a peaceful transfer of power. The ministry posted the statement on Telegram, clarifying that Moscow was not directly involved in the negotiations but had been closely monitoring the situation with significant concern. Since 2015, Russia has been involved militarily in Syria, partnering with Iran to support Assad’s government against opposition forces, helping it regain control of much of the country. However, with its primary military focus now on the conflict in Ukraine, Russia has reduced its active operations in Syria while maintaining a presence through its military bases and troops stationed there.The post Russia Claims Assad Leaves Syria, Orders Peaceful Power Transfer first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/russia-assad-leaves-syria-peaceful-transfer/	2024-12-08T10:08:02-08:00	
Nations Call for Stability as Rebels Oust Assad	Islamist-led rebels have successfully overthrown Syria’s long-standing leader, Bashar al-Assad, in a rapid offensive. The event has been described as a pivotal moment in Syria's civil war by the United Nations' special envoy. Here are global reactions to the situation: China expressed its hope that Syria could quickly return to stability, closely monitoring the ongoing developments in the country. Similarly, France welcomed Assad’s ousting, urging Syrians to reject extremism and push for unity amidst the nation's fragmentation, calling for a peaceful transition. Germany’s Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock stressed the importance of preventing Syria from falling into the hands of radicals, emphasizing the need to protect ethnic and religious minorities, such as Kurds and Alawites. In Iran, diplomats from Assad’s ally were reported to have evacuated the Syrian embassy in Damascus after it came under attack. Iran’s foreign minister had previously called for political dialogue between the Syrian government and opposition groups. Turkey's Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan acknowledged that the downfall of Assad was the culmination of Syria's prolonged civil war, which had plunged the country into turmoil over the past 13 years. A senior official from the United Arab Emirates urged Syrians to cooperate and prevent further chaos in the country. The United Kingdom echoed the sentiment of seeking stability through political solutions, despite acknowledging the brutal rule of Assad. The United Nations, cautiously optimistic, referred to the situation as a moment of hope for peace and reconciliation. Meanwhile, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump attributed Assad’s fall to Russia’s lack of interest in continuing its support for the Syrian regime. This shift marks a significant development in the ongoing conflict, with calls for both international cooperation and internal unity to chart a path forward for Syria.The post Nations Call for Stability as Rebels Oust Assad first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/nations-call-stability-rebels-oust-assad/	2024-12-08T10:07:52-08:00	
Israel Hits Syrian Arms Depots Near Damascus	In recent developments, Israel has reportedly targeted multiple Syrian arms depots near Damascus, focusing on sites that could potentially serve hostile forces in the region. These airstrikes, attributed to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), are part of Israel's ongoing efforts to neutralize military threats from Syria, particularly as the country grapples with instability amidst the collapse of Assad’s regime. The IDF has long been concerned about the growing presence of Iranian-backed forces and Hezbollah in Syria, which pose a strategic threat, particularly near Israel's northern border. The targeted strikes are believed to have struck weapons depots containing missile systems and potentially chemical weapons. Israeli authorities have been increasingly active in striking such facilities to limit the supply of advanced weaponry to groups hostile to Israel, such as Hezbollah. This military action coincides with reports of significant unrest within Syria, as various rebel factions make significant territorial gains, including areas close to Damascus. The escalating conflict has prompted Israeli officials to bolster their defense along the Golan Heights, while also monitoring the situation in Syria closely to prevent further destabilization near its borders. Israel’s airstrikes are seen as a continuation of its policy of preventing the transfer of advanced weaponry to its adversaries. Despite Syria’s claims of intercepting some missiles, these actions underscore the complexity of the regional security dynamics, where Israeli concerns about a potential Iranian and Hezbollah foothold in Syria remain a primary focus.The post Israel Hits Syrian Arms Depots Near Damascus first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-hits-syrian-arms-depots-near-damascus/	2024-12-08T10:07:42-08:00	
Netanyahu Orders Army to Seize Syria Buffer Zone	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently ordered the Israeli military to seize control of the buffer zone along the border with Syria, an area that had been under the protection of UN peacekeepers for decades. This action follows significant shifts in Syria's political landscape, including the weakening of President Bashar al-Assad's regime and the increasing instability in the region. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have begun bolstering defenses and constructing infrastructure along the border, including the creation of new roads and a buffer zone similar to the one already established along the Gaza frontier. Satellite imagery has revealed Israeli military personnel entering the so-called Alpha Line, a demilitarized zone that separates the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights from Syrian territory. These actions are seen as a response to the growing uncertainty surrounding Syria's future, particularly as rebel forces and Islamist groups gain ground and Assad's control weakens. The move is part of Israel's broader strategy to secure its northern border and prepare for potential post-Assad scenarios in Syria. While there has been no significant violence reported in the region yet, the presence of Israeli troops in the demilitarized zone represents a violation of the ceasefire agreements that have been in place since 1974. This escalation could increase tensions, as Syria, despite its silence on the matter, has historically opposed Israeli occupation and military actions in this area. Israel's decision to strengthen its hold on the Golan Heights region reflects the broader geopolitical changes in Syria, with the IDF anticipating further instability in the wake of Assad’s declining power. This strategic move aligns with Israel's long-term security interests, especially given the presence of Iranian-backed forces and Hezbollah near its northern border.The post Netanyahu Orders Army to Seize Syria Buffer Zone first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/netanyahu-army-seize-syria-buffer-zone/	2024-12-08T10:07:32-08:00
