Trading 212 review	1. Introduction to Trading 212 Trading 212, founded in 2004 as Avus Capital in Bulgaria, has evolved into a prominent fintech broker headquartered in London since 2013. Initially focused on forex trading, it expanded its offerings in 2017 to include commission-free stocks and ETFs, a move that fueled its rapid growth. Today, it boasts over 2.5 million users and manages more than €4 billion in client assets, positioning it as a key player in the retail brokerage space. Its mission to democratize investing has resonated globally, particularly in Europe, where it enjoys a strong market presence. The broker operates under robust regulatory oversight. Trading 212 UK Limited is authorized by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) with license number 609146, while Trading 212 Markets Ltd., based in Cyprus, is regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) under license number 398/21. Additionally, it falls under the Bulgarian Financial Supervision Commission (FSC). This multi-jurisdictional regulation enhances its credibility. Trading 212’s reputation is bolstered by its long operational history and innovative approach, though it has faced scrutiny over past customer service delays. Its global reach spans the European Economic Area (EEA) and beyond, with a user-friendly platform that appeals to both novice and seasoned investors, cementing its status as a competitive alternative to traditional brokers. 2. How to Register on Trading 212 Registering with Trading 212 is a streamlined, fully digital process designed for accessibility. Begin by visiting their website or downloading the mobile app from the App Store or Google Play. Click 'Open Account' and select your preferred account type—Invest, CFD, or ISA (for UK residents). You’ll need to provide your country of residence, email address, and a secure password, followed by basic personal details like your name, date of birth, and address. Next comes the Know Your Customer (KYC) verification, a regulatory requirement to combat fraud and money laundering. You’ll submit a government-issued ID (passport, driver’s license, or national ID card) and proof of address (utility bill, bank statement, or tax document dated within the last three months). Upload these via the app or website; the process is intuitive, with prompts guiding you. Verification typically takes one business day, though delays can occur during peak times. Once approved, you can fund your account and start trading. The low entry barrier—minimum deposits as little as €1 for Invest accounts—makes it beginner-friendly, though ensuring accurate document submission is key to avoiding hiccups. 3. Trading 212 Login Process After registration, logging into Trading 212 is straightforward. On the website or app, enter your registered email and password on the login screen. For added security, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) via the settings, requiring a code sent to your phone or email alongside your credentials. First-time logins may prompt a device verification step for safety. Common login issues include forgotten passwords, easily resolved by clicking 'Forgot Password' and following the reset link sent to your email. Incorrect email entry or account lockouts from multiple failed attempts can also occur; in such cases, contact support via live chat or email. Slow internet or outdated app versions might cause loading delays—ensure your app is updated and your connection stable. If 2FA codes don’t arrive, check your spam folder or resend the code. Trading 212’s login process is efficient, with security features like 2FA ensuring peace of mind, though users should maintain updated contact details to avoid access issues. 4. Available Account Types Trading 212 offers three main account types tailored to different trading needs, with no corporate accounts available as of 2025. The Invest Account focuses on commission-free stock and ETF trading, requiring a €1 minimum deposit. It supports multiple base currencies (e.g., GBP, USD, EUR) and is ideal for long-term investors. The CFD Account, aimed at active traders, allows leveraged trading on forex, commodities, and indices, with a €10 minimum deposit and higher risk due to leverage up to 1:30 for retail clients. The Stocks and Shares ISA (UK only) offers tax-free investing up to £20,000 annually, also with a €1 minimum, catering to UK residents seeking tax efficiency. Key differences lie in asset access and tax benefits. The Invest Account and ISA focus on real assets without leverage, while the CFD Account offers derivatives with higher risk and reward potential. The ISA’s tax advantage is unique, but it’s geographically restricted. All accounts benefit from zero commission on stocks, though CFDs incur spreads and overnight fees. Professional accounts, available to qualifying traders with experience and capital, unlock leverage up to 1:500 but require a separate application. This variety suits diverse strategies, though the lack of joint or corporate options may limit some users. 5. Demo Account Availability Trading 212 provides a free demo account, a valuable tool for beginners and strategy testers alike. Accessible to all registered users, it mirrors the live platform with virtual funds—typically $50,000, though adjustable—to simulate real trading conditions across Invest and CFD accounts. To open one, register as usual, then toggle to 'Demo Mode' from the account dashboard or app settings. No additional verification is needed beyond the initial signup. The demo features full platform functionality: real-time market data, charting tools, and order types like stop-loss or limit orders. Users can switch between Invest (stocks, ETFs) and CFD (leveraged products) modes, testing strategies without financial risk. It’s indefinitely available, unlike some brokers’ 30-day limits, making it ideal for ongoing practice. While it lacks emotional stakes of real trading, it’s a robust sandbox for learning platform navigation and market dynamics. Updates in 2025 ensure it reflects current asset offerings and interface changes, maintaining relevance for prospective traders. 6. Trading Platform Overview Trading 212’s proprietary platform spans web, desktop, and mobile, delivering a cohesive experience optimized for accessibility. The web platform, accessible via browser, offers a clean interface with real-time charts, basic technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI), and a portfolio overview. It’s intuitive but lacks deep customization, suiting beginners over advanced traders. The desktop version, launched in recent years, enhances this with faster execution and multi-monitor support, though it remains less feature-rich than rivals like MetaTrader. The mobile app, Trading 212’s flagship, shines with a 4.6/5 rating across 15 million downloads. Available on iOS and Android, it mirrors web features—real-time quotes, one-tap trades, and push notifications—while adding mobile-specific perks like biometric login and a sleek, touch-optimized design. Tools include over 30 indicators, price alerts, and an economic calendar, though advanced charting (e.g., Fibonacci retracement) is limited. All versions support multi-currency accounts and fractional shares, but customization options lag behind competitors. In 2025, updates have improved speed and stability, making it a reliable, user-friendly choice for casual traders, though power users may crave more depth. 7. Markets and Assets Available Trading 212 offers a broad but selective asset range in 2025. Stocks include over 9,000 listings from major exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ, LSE), featuring giants like Apple and Tesla. Forex covers 184 currency pairs, with popular options like EUR/USD and GBP/JPY. Cryptocurrencies are absent as direct trading options, a shift from prior years due to regulatory pressures, though CFDs on crypto exist. Commodities (via CFDs) include gold, oil, and silver, while ETFs number over 1,000, such as Vanguard S&P 500 (VOO). Fractional shares enable small investments in high-value stocks like Amazon. Options and bonds are notably absent, limiting diversification compared to full-service brokers. The Invest Account focuses on stocks and ETFs, while CFDs expand to forex, commodities, and indices (e.g., S&P 500, FTSE 100). This mix caters to equity and derivative traders but disappoints crypto enthusiasts or bond investors. Asset availability varies by region—EEA users access fewer CFDs under stricter rules. Popular assets like NVIDIA stock or gold CFDs highlight Trading 212’s strength in mainstream markets, though its scope remains narrower than competitors like eToro. 8. Fees and Commissions Trading 212’s fee structure in 2025 remains a standout feature. Trading fees for stocks and ETFs on the Invest Account are zero—commission-free trading is its hallmark. For CFDs, costs are built into spreads (e.g., 0.9 pips for EUR/USD, slightly above the 0.8 industry average), with no separate commissions. Overnight fees (swap rates) apply to CFD positions held past market close, varying by asset (e.g., 0.02% daily for gold). Currency conversion fees are a modest 0.15% for Invest accounts, far below the 0.5%-1% industry norm, though CFDs charge 0.5%. Non-trading fees are minimal: no withdrawal or inactivity fees, a rarity among brokers. Deposits are free via bank transfer, but a 0.7% fee kicks in for card/electronic wallet deposits exceeding €2,000 cumulatively. Compared to peers like eToro (0.5% withdrawal fee) or Interactive Brokers (tiered commissions), Trading 212 is cost-competitive, especially for buy-and-hold investors. However, larger traders may find CFD spreads less favorable than raw-spread brokers. Its low-fee model aligns with its mission to make investing accessible, though hidden costs like wider spreads warrant scrutiny. 9. Deposit and Withdrawal Methods Trading 212 supports diverse funding options in 2025. Deposits can be made via bank transfer (free, 1-2 days), credit/debit cards (Visa/Mastercard, instant up to €2,000 free), and electronic wallets like PayPal, Google Pay, and Apple Pay (availability varies by country). Post-€2,000, a 0.7% fee applies to non-bank methods. Minimums start at €1 (Invest/ISA) or €10 (CFD). Withdrawals follow the same methods, requiring the original deposit source for security. The process is simple: from the 'Manage Funds' tab, enter your password, select an amount, and confirm. Bank transfers take 1-3 business days, while card/wallet withdrawals are often faster (1-2 days). No withdrawal fees apply, though banks may charge receiving fees. Limits are flexible—no minimum withdrawal—but large transactions may trigger additional checks. Compared to brokers with $5 withdrawal fees (e.g., eToro), Trading 212 excels in cost and ease, though slower bank transfer times and regional wallet restrictions could frustrate some users. 10. Bonuses and Promotions In 2025, Trading 212 offers a modest but appealing promotional perk: a free fractional share worth up to €100 for new users who deposit within a set timeframe (typically 10 days post-registration). Eligibility requires a minimum deposit (often €10) and account verification. The share, randomly assigned (e.g., Apple, Tesla), comes with terms: it can’t be withdrawn as cash and must be sold to access funds, subject to market fluctuations. A referral program also exists—invite friends, and both parties receive a free share (up to €100) once the referee deposits and trades. No ongoing loyalty schemes or cash bonuses are available, reflecting Trading 212’s focus on low fees over gimmicks. Conditions are transparent: promotions are time-limited, and shares are subject to a holding period (e.g., 30 days) before sale. Compared to eToro’s sporadic deposit bonuses, Trading 212’s offers are simpler but less frequent, appealing to cost-conscious beginners rather than bonus-driven traders. 11. Trading Tools and Features Trading 212’s tools in 2025 cater to practicality over complexity. Charting tools include over 30 technical indicators (e.g., MACD, Bollinger Bands) with adjustable timeframes, though advanced features like Fibonacci tools are absent. An economic calendar tracks key events (e.g., Fed rate decisions), while price alerts notify users of market moves. The AutoInvest feature automates stock/ETF purchases, ideal for passive investors building 'Pies' (custom portfolios). Supported order types include market, limit, stop-loss, and take-profit orders, with CFD accounts adding trailing stops. These are sufficient for basic strategies but lack the sophistication of conditional orders found on MetaTrader. Real-time data and portfolio reports enhance usability, yet the toolkit feels streamlined rather than robust. Compared to IG’s extensive analytics or TradingView integration, Trading 212 prioritizes simplicity, making it accessible for beginners but potentially underwhelming for technical traders seeking depth. 12. Leverage and Margin Requirements Trading 212 offers leverage up to 1:30 for retail CFD clients in 2025, capped by EU/UK regulations (e.g., 1:30 for major forex pairs, 1:20 for indices). Professional traders, upon qualification (e.g., €500,000 portfolio, trading experience), access up to 1:500, significantly amplifying potential gains—and losses. Margin requirements vary: 3.33% for forex (1:30) or 5% for indices (1:20), meaning a $1,000 position requires $33.33 or $50, respectively. Margin calls trigger at 100% usage, with a stop-out level at 50%, closing positions to prevent negative balances—Trading 212 guarantees negative balance protection for retail clients. High leverage magnifies risk; a 1% move against a 1:30 position wipes out the margin. While competitive with industry standards, beginners should approach cautiously, as leveraged trading’s volatility can lead to rapid losses, especially without robust risk management. 13. Educational Resources Trading 212’s educational offerings in 2025 are decent but not standout. Beginner guides cover basics like 'What is a Stock?' via short articles and explainer videos on YouTube, focusing on stocks, ETFs, and CFDs. Tutorials within the app explain platform features (e.g., setting stop-losses), while a FAQ section addresses common queries. No live webinars or in-depth courses exist, unlike IG Academy’s structured programs. Content quality is clear and digestible, ideal for novices, but lacks advanced topics (e.g., options strategies) or daily market analysis. Interest rate updates and asset class overviews are available, yet they’re basic compared to eToro’s social-driven insights. For self-starters, it’s a solid starting point, but active traders seeking comprehensive learning or real-time reports may need external resources. 14. Social and Copy Trading As of 2025, Trading 212 does not offer social or copy trading features. Unlike eToro or ZuluTrade, which thrive on community-driven trading and leaderboards, Trading 212 focuses on individual investing. There’s no platform to follow top traders or mirror portfolios, nor a social feed for sharing ideas. The '212 Hotlist' shows popular stocks by user ownership, but it’s informational, not interactive. This absence aligns with its low-cost, self-directed ethos but may disappoint users seeking peer insights or passive strategies. Competitors fill this gap, making Trading 212 less appealing for those prioritizing social engagement over independent control. 15. Customer Support Trading 212 provides live chat and email support, available 24/7 in 16 languages, but lacks phone assistance—a drawback for urgent issues. The live chat, accessible via the app or website, typically connects within minutes, with knowledgeable agents addressing account or trading queries. Email responses take up to 24 hours, suitable for non-urgent matters. User feedback praises quick chat resolutions but notes occasional delays during high traffic. The FAQ section covers basics (e.g., withdrawals, verification), reducing support reliance. Compared to IG’s phone support or eToro’s ticket system, Trading 212’s channels are efficient yet limited. Quality is strong for routine help, though complex issues may require persistence. 16. Safety, Security, and Regulation Trading 212 operates under top-tier oversight: FCA (UK, 609146), CySEC (Cyprus, 398/21), and FSC (Bulgaria). Client funds are segregated in separate accounts, ensuring they’re untouchable if the broker fails. UK clients enjoy FSCS protection up to £85,000, while EEA users get €20,000 via the ICF—standard but lower than some peers. Additional private insurance from Lloyd’s of London covers up to €1,000,000, a rare perk. Security features include 2FA, SSL encryption, and biometric logins on mobile. No major breaches have been reported by 2025, reinforcing trust. While CySEC’s lighter oversight raises occasional skepticism, FCA regulation and fund protections make Trading 212 a secure choice, aligning with industry safety norms. 17. Pros and Cons of Trading 212 Pros: Commission-free stock/ETF trading is a major draw, paired with a low 0.15% FX fee for Invest accounts. The user-friendly app and web platform excel for beginners, while multi-currency accounts (e.g., USD, EUR, GBP) minimize conversion costs. No withdrawal/inactivity fees and a free demo enhance accessibility. High regulatory standards and negative balance protection bolster safety. Cons: Limited asset classes—no crypto, bonds, or options—restrict diversification. CFD spreads (e.g., 0.9 pips EUR/USD) are average, not best-in-class. Charting tools lack depth, and educational resources are basic, trailing competitors. No social/copy trading or phone support may deter some. The 0.7% deposit fee post-€2,000 and regional restrictions (e.g., no US clients) are further drawbacks. 18. Comparison with Other Brokers Versus eToro, Trading 212 wins on fees (no withdrawal charges vs. eToro’s $5) but lacks crypto trading and social features eToro champions. Interactive Brokers (IBKR) offers broader assets (bonds, options) and advanced tools, yet its tiered commissions contrast Trading 212’s zero-cost model. IG provides superior charting and education, plus phone support, but charges higher fees (e.g., £8/trade). Trading 212’s edge is cost and simplicity; eToro excels in social trading, IBKR in asset depth, and IG in analytics. Beginners favor Trading 212, while active traders may lean toward IBKR or IG for sophistication. 19. User Reviews and Ratings On Trustpilot (4.6/5 from 46,000+ reviews in 2025), Trading 212 earns praise for its fee-free trading, intuitive app, and fast deposits. Users laud the demo account and 24/7 chat support. Google Reviews echo this, averaging 4.5/5, with compliments on fractional shares and interest on uninvested cash (5.2% in Cash ISA). Forums like Reddit highlight its beginner appeal. Complaints focus on withdrawal delays (1-3 days), verification slowdowns, and limited assets (no crypto). Some report CFD spread dissatisfaction and past support bottlenecks, though improvements are noted. Overall, it’s well-regarded for cost and ease, with gripes tied to niche needs. 20. Platform Availability by Country Trading 212 serves the EEA (e.g., Germany, France, Poland), UK, and select non-EEA countries (e.g., South Africa, UAE), with account approval potentially slower outside the EEA. Restricted regions include the US, Canada, Belgium, and Japan due to regulatory barriers. Availability varies by entity: Trading 212 UK Ltd. for UK clients, Trading 212 Markets Ltd. for EEA. Pre-2021 EU accounts remain FCA-regulated. Country-specific base currencies (e.g., PLN in Poland) enhance local appeal, but crypto bans or CFD limits apply per regional rules. Check the website’s eligibility tool for clarity, as expansion continues in 2025. 21. Taxation and Declaring Profits Taxation on Trading 212 profits depends on your country. In the UK, Invest Account gains face Capital Gains Tax (CGT) above £6,000 annually, while ISAs are tax-free up to £20,000. EEA traders report to local tax authorities (e.g., Belgium requires foreign account declaration). Trading 212 doesn’t withhold taxes but provides portfolio reports detailing transactions, downloadable from the app—users must calculate and declare profits themselves. No formal tax statements are issued, unlike some US brokers, so consulting a tax professional is wise. Forex/CFD gains may be treated as income in some jurisdictions, adding complexity. Clarity on local laws is essential for compliance. 22. Common Issues and How to Solve Them Login Problems: Forgotten passwords? Use 'Forgot Password' for a reset link. 2FA delays? Check spam or resend the code. Withdrawal Delays: 1-3 day waits are normal; ensure matching payment methods and contact support if over 5 days. Verification Troubles: Rejected IDs? Resubmit clear, unexpired documents; live chat can expedite. Platform Bugs: Crashes or lag? Update the app, clear cache, or reinstall. Users report occasional order execution glitches—retry or report via chat. Slow support responses during peak times improve with persistence. Most issues tie to user error or processing times, resolvable with patience and clear communication. 23. Final Verdict Trading 212 shines with zero-commission trading, a slick app, and low entry barriers, making it a top pick for beginners and cost-conscious investors. Multi-currency accounts, fractional shares, and strong regulation (FCA, CySEC) add appeal, while the demo account fosters learning. However, limited assets (no crypto, bonds), basic tools, and average CFD spreads hinder its allure for advanced traders. Customer support, while 24/7, lacks phone options, and educational content is underwhelming. It’s best for novice to intermediate traders seeking affordable stock/ETF investing or casual CFD trading, less so for pros needing depth or diversification. In 2025, Trading 212 remains a solid, accessible choice with room to grow. 24. FAQs What is the minimum deposit? €1 for Invest/ISA, €10 for CFD accounts. How long do withdrawals take? 1-3 business days, depending on method. Is Trading 212 safe? Yes, regulated by FCA/CySEC with segregated funds and compensation schemes. What are the available trading platforms? Web, desktop, and mobile app (iOS/Android). Is Trading 212 regulated? Yes, by FCA (609146), CySEC (398/21), and FSC. Are there any inactivity fees? No, Trading 212 charges no inactivity fees. Does Trading 212 support cryptocurrency trading? No direct crypto trading; CFDs on crypto are available. What are the available contact methods for customer support? Live chat and email, 24/7.

ActivTrades	1. Introduction to ActivTrades ActivTrades, established in 2001 in Switzerland, has grown into a prominent online broker specializing in forex and Contracts for Difference (CFDs). Initially a stock brokerage, it relocated its headquarters to London in 2005 to capitalize on Europe’s financial hub, expanding its offerings to include CFDs on indices, commodities, and cryptocurrencies. Today, ActivTrades serves over 30,000 active traders globally, with additional offices in Milan, Sofia, and Nassau, reflecting its robust international presence. The broker has earned a strong reputation for reliability, transparency, and innovation, bolstered by multiple industry awards, such as 'Best Online Trading Services' at the ADVFN International Financial Awards. ActivTrades operates under stringent regulatory oversight, ensuring client trust and security. Its primary entity, ActivTrades PLC, is regulated by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) under license number 434413, a top-tier regulator known for its rigorous standards. Additional entities include ActivTrades Corp, regulated by the Securities Commission of the Bahamas (SCB, license 199667 B), and ActivTrades Europe S.A., overseen by Luxembourg’s CSSF (license P00000491). These licenses underscore its commitment to compliance across jurisdictions. With over two decades in the industry, ActivTrades holds a competitive position in the forex and CFD market, appealing to both novice and seasoned traders through its advanced platforms and customer-centric services. 2. How to Register on ActivTrades Registering with ActivTrades is a straightforward process designed for efficiency and security. Begin by visiting the official website (activtrades.com) and clicking 'Open an Account.' You’ll be prompted to select your account type (e.g., individual or professional) and provide basic personal details: full name, email address, phone number, and country of residence. Next, choose your preferred trading platform (e.g., MetaTrader 5 or ActivTrader) and account currency (EUR, USD, GBP, or CHF). The Know Your Customer (KYC) process follows, requiring identity verification to comply with regulatory standards. You’ll need to upload a government-issued ID (passport, driver’s license, or national ID card) and proof of address (e.g., a utility bill or bank statement dated within the last three months). For professional accounts, additional documentation proving trading experience or financial status may be requested. The online form also includes questions about your trading experience, employment status, and financial background to assess suitability. Once submitted, verification typically takes 24 hours, though it may extend slightly during peak times. Upon approval, you’ll receive login credentials via email, granting access to your trading account. 3. ActivTrades Login Process After registration, logging into ActivTrades is simple. Visit the website or open your chosen trading platform (e.g., MetaTrader 4, MetaTrader 5, or ActivTrader). Enter your registered email address or account number and the password provided during setup. For mobile app users, the process mirrors the desktop experience—download the app from the App Store or Google Play, input your credentials, and log in. First-time users may need to reset their temporary password via an email link. Common login issues include forgotten passwords, easily resolved by selecting 'Forgot Password' and following the reset prompts. Incorrect account numbers or platform mismatches (e.g., using MT4 credentials on MT5) can also occur; double-check your details or contact support. Slow internet connections may delay login—ensure a stable network. ActivTrades employs two-factor authentication (2FA) for added security, requiring a code sent to your phone or email, so keep your registered devices accessible. If locked out after multiple failed attempts, wait 15 minutes or reach out to customer support for assistance. 4. Available Account Types ActivTrades offers a variety of account types tailored to different trader profiles. The Individual Account suits most retail traders, featuring leverage up to 1:30 (per ESMA regulations), no minimum deposit (except $500 for Brazil and China), and access to all platforms and assets. The Professional Account targets experienced traders, offering leverage up to 1:400, tighter spreads, and zero-fee CFD share trading with 1:1 leverage, but requires proof of significant trading experience or financial qualifications. The Islamic Account, swap-free and Sharia-compliant, caters to Muslim traders, maintaining the same features as the Individual Account without overnight fees. The Corporate Account supports businesses or institutional clients, with customized solutions and higher deposit thresholds, though specifics vary by agreement. Each account type provides negative balance protection and access to over 1,000 CFDs, but differs in leverage, fees, and eligibility. Professional accounts demand a higher risk tolerance and expertise, while Individual and Islamic accounts prioritize accessibility. Demo accounts are also available across all types for practice, requiring no deposit. Traders should assess their experience and goals when choosing, as perks like higher leverage come with increased risk. 5. Demo Account Availability ActivTrades provides a robust demo account, ideal for testing strategies risk-free. Available to all users, it mirrors live market conditions with virtual funds, offering access to forex, CFDs, and all supported platforms (MT4, MT5, ActivTrader, and TradingView). To open one, visit the website, select 'Demo Account,' and fill out a brief form with your name, email, and preferred platform. No deposit or full registration is required for an initial 72-hour trial, a unique feature in the industry. For extended use, complete the standard registration process, and the demo remains active indefinitely. The demo account features real-time quotes, customizable leverage, and the full suite of trading tools, allowing users to practice scalping, hedging, or automated trading. It’s particularly valuable for beginners learning platform navigation or seasoned traders testing new strategies. Unlike some brokers, ActivTrades doesn’t limit demo functionality, ensuring an authentic experience. To switch to a live account, simply fund your profile after mastering the demo. This offering enhances ActivTrades’ appeal for skill-building without financial commitment. 6. Trading Platform Overview ActivTrades offers a versatile suite of trading platforms catering to diverse preferences. The web-based ActivTrader, powered by TradingView charts, boasts an intuitive interface with advanced charting, over 90 indicators, and customizable layouts, ideal for beginners and intermediate traders. However, it lacks some advanced features of desktop alternatives. MetaTrader 4 (MT4) and MetaTrader 5 (MT5), available for desktop download, are industry standards favored by experienced traders. MT4 offers 50+ indicators and robust automation via Expert Advisors (EAs), while MT5 adds deeper market insights, more order types, and an economic calendar—both support Windows and Mac. The mobile apps for ActivTrader, MT4, and MT5 (iOS and Android) ensure seamless trading on the go, mirroring desktop functionality with real-time quotes, one-tap execution, and charting tools. Customization options include adjustable leverage and watchlists, though the mobile UI can feel cramped on smaller screens. ActivTrades enhances MT platforms with proprietary add-ons like SmartOrder and SmartLines, improving order execution and risk management. While the platforms excel in usability and tools, the ActivTrader desktop version offers fewer customization options compared to MT5, potentially limiting advanced traders. 7. Markets and Assets Available ActivTrades specializes in CFD trading, offering over 1,000 instruments across multiple markets. Forex includes 50+ currency pairs, from majors like EUR/USD to exotics like USD/CNH, with tight spreads starting at 0.5 pips. Commodities cover 20+ assets, including gold, silver, and oil, providing diversification opportunities. Indices feature 19 global options like the S&P 500 and FTSE 100, appealing to macro-focused traders. Cryptocurrency CFDs (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) are available under the Bahamas entity, with up to 1:20 leverage, though not offered in the UK due to FCA restrictions. Stocks CFDs encompass around 1,000 companies, including Apple, Tesla, and BP, across US, UK, and European markets, but real stocks, bonds, ETFs, options, and fractional shares are absent, limiting traditional investment options. This CFD-centric focus suits short-term traders but may disappoint long-term investors. Popular assets like EUR/USD, gold, and Bitcoin attract significant volume, supported by fast execution and competitive pricing. The asset range, while robust for CFDs, lacks the breadth of multi-asset brokers like Interactive Brokers. 8. Fees and Commissions ActivTrades’ fee structure is competitive, with trading costs primarily driven by spreads rather than commissions on most accounts. Forex spreads start at 0.5 pips for majors like EUR/USD, slightly below the industry average of 0.7-1.0 pips, while exotic pairs may widen during volatility. CFDs on indices (e.g., S&P 500) average 0.5-1 point, and commodities like gold hover around 0.25 pips—cost-effective for active traders. Overnight (swap) fees apply to positions held past 5 PM EST, varying by asset and leverage, with rates disclosed transparently on the website. Non-trading fees include a $10 monthly inactivity fee after 12 months of dormancy, aligning with industry norms. Deposits are free, but withdrawals via bank transfer incur a $9 fee for amounts under $100; e-wallets and cards are typically fee-free. Currency conversion fees (around 0.5%) apply if your account currency differs from the transaction, a standard charge but notable for multi-currency traders. Compared to peers like FxPro or Admirals, ActivTrades offers lower spreads and no commission on standard accounts, though its inactivity fee and conversion costs could add up for less active users. 9. Deposit and Withdrawal Methods ActivTrades supports diverse deposit options: bank transfers, debit/credit cards (Visa, Mastercard), and e-wallets like Neteller, Skrill, and PayPal (availability varies by region). There’s no minimum deposit for most regions, though Brazil and China require $500. Deposits are processed instantly for cards and e-wallets, while bank transfers take 1-3 business days. No fees are charged, enhancing cost efficiency. Withdrawals follow a similar process—submit a request via the client portal, with processing completed same-day if submitted before 12:30 PM GMT, otherwise next day. Bank transfers take 1-3 days, e-wallets and cards are faster (often within hours), but a $9 fee applies to bank withdrawals under $100. Limits are flexible, with no strict caps, though large transactions may require additional verification. Cryptocurrency payments are unsupported due to regulatory constraints, a minor drawback compared to some competitors. Overall, the process is efficient and transparent, though withdrawal fees for small amounts could deter casual traders. 10. Bonuses and Promotions As of March 2025, ActivTrades offers limited bonuses due to strict regulatory oversight, particularly under FCA rules banning incentives for retail clients. However, its Bahamas entity occasionally provides promotions, such as a welcome bonus (e.g., 10% deposit match up to $500) for new traders depositing $100+, subject to trading volume requirements (e.g., 10 lots within 90 days). Terms are clear: bonuses are non-withdrawable, and failure to meet conditions voids the offer. Always check the website for current offers, as they vary by region. The Affiliate Program stands out, offering up to $1,350 CPA per referred client who deposits $100 and generates $40 in spreads within 180 days, with no commission cap and robust marketing tools via CELLXPERT. Loyalty schemes are absent, but high-volume traders may negotiate rebates informally. While promotional offerings are modest compared to offshore brokers, the focus on regulation ensures fairness, appealing to cautious traders over bonus hunters. 11. Trading Tools and Features ActivTrades equips traders with a solid toolkit. Charting tools, powered by TradingView on ActivTrader and enhanced on MT4/MT5, include over 90 technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD) and 14+ chart types for in-depth analysis. The economic calendar tracks global events, aiding fundamental traders, while the Market Sentiment indicator gauges crowd behavior. Proprietary tools like SmartOrder (fast execution) and SmartLines (automated trade triggers) enhance MT platforms, though historical data access is limited. Supported order types include market, limit, stop-loss, and trailing stop, with ActivTrader’s Progressive Trailing Stop dynamically adjusting to price targets—a standout feature. Hedging and scalping are permitted, and EAs on MT4/MT5 support automation. While not as extensive as some rivals (e.g., Thinkorswim’s 400+ indicators), the tools strike a balance between accessibility and sophistication, suiting most trading styles effectively. 12. Leverage and Margin Requirements ActivTrades offers leverage up to 1:30 for retail clients under FCA/ESMA rules, with professional accounts reaching 1:400 upon qualification (e.g., significant trading history or $500,000 portfolio). Forex majors typically allow 1:30, while cryptocurrencies cap at 1:20 under the Bahamas entity. Margin requirements vary—3.33% for 1:30 leverage, dropping to 0.25% at 1:400—calculated as a percentage of the position’s notional value. Margin calls trigger at 100% (full margin used), with stop-out at 50%, closing positions to prevent negative balances. High leverage amplifies gains but magnifies losses; a $1,000 position at 1:400 could wipe out with a 0.25% adverse move. Negative balance protection mitigates this risk, but traders must exercise caution. Compared to offshore brokers offering 1:1000+, ActivTrades’ caps reflect regulatory prudence, balancing opportunity and safety. 13. Educational Resources ActivTrades provides a comprehensive educational suite for all skill levels. Beginner guides cover forex basics, CFD mechanics, and risk management, written in clear, actionable language. Live webinars, hosted weekly by experts, delve into technical analysis, market trends, and platform use, with recordings available on-demand. Video tutorials span platform navigation, order types, and strategy development, averaging 5-10 minutes for digestibility. Daily market analysis and commentary on forex, indices, and commodities offer actionable insights, though depth varies—some reports lack the granularity of competitors like IG. The quality is high, with practical examples and multilingual support, but the absence of structured courses or certification limits advanced learning. For beginners and intermediates, these resources build confidence and competence effectively. 14. Social and Copy Trading ActivTrades does not offer social or copy trading as of March 2025, focusing instead on direct trading platforms like MT4, MT5, and ActivTrader. Unlike competitors such as eToro or Vantage, which integrate social features to mimic expert trades or share strategies, ActivTrades prioritizes individual control and proprietary tools. This omission reflects its regulatory stance and target audience—self-directed traders over passive investors. While MT4/MT5 support signal services via third-party providers (e.g., MQL5 community), this isn’t broker-integrated copy trading. Traders seeking social interaction or automated portfolio mirroring may find this a drawback, though the broker’s robust toolkit compensates for active, hands-on users. 15. Customer Support ActivTrades offers 24/5 customer support via live chat, email (support@activtrades.com), and phone (+44 207 6500 567), aligning with forex market hours (Monday 00:00 to Friday 23:59 GMT). Multilingual assistance in 14 languages, including English, Spanish, and Mandarin, ensures global accessibility. Live chat responses average under 2 minutes, with knowledgeable agents addressing account, platform, and withdrawal queries efficiently. Email replies typically arrive within 24 hours, while phone support offers immediate resolution for urgent issues. User feedback praises responsiveness and professionalism, though weekend unavailability (common in the industry) frustrates some. Compared to 24/7 brokers like Pepperstone, ActivTrades’ support is robust but not round-the-clock. For most traders, the quality and speed suffice, especially during peak trading times. 16. Safety, Security, and Regulation ActivTrades is regulated by top-tier authorities: FCA (434413) in the UK, SCB (199667 B) in the Bahamas, and CSSF (P00000491) in Luxembourg, with additional oversight from Portugal’s CMVM and Brazil’s CVM. Client funds are held in segregated accounts at Tier-1 banks, separate from company assets, ensuring protection in case of insolvency. The FCA’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) covers up to £85,000 for UK clients, while ActivTrades enhances this with private insurance from Lloyd’s of London up to $1 million per client—a rare perk. Security features include 2FA via SMS or email, SSL encryption for data transmission, and regular audits. Negative balance protection prevents debt, aligning with ESMA rules. This multi-layered approach makes ActivTrades a standout for safety-conscious traders, surpassing many peers in fund protection. 17. Pros and Cons of ActivTrades Pros: ActivTrades excels with tight spreads (from 0.5 pips), no deposit fees, and a wide range of CFDs (1,000+ instruments). Its top-tier regulation (FCA, SCB) and $1 million insurance bolster trust, while MT4/MT5 and ActivTrader platforms cater to diverse needs. Fast execution, negative balance protection, and a feature-rich demo account enhance its appeal. Cons: The broker’s CFD-only focus excludes real stocks, bonds, and ETFs, limiting long-term investors. Customer support lacks weekend availability, and an inactivity fee ($10/month) may irk dormant users. Currency conversion fees and a narrow base currency range (EUR, USD, GBP, CHF) add minor costs. The absence of social/copy trading disappoints passive traders. 18. Comparison with Other Brokers Compared to FxPro, ActivTrades offers lower forex spreads (0.5 vs. 0.6 pips) and no commission on standard accounts, though FxPro includes cTrader and more base currencies. Admirals provides a broader asset range (stocks, ETFs) and lower inactivity fees ($6 vs. $10), but its spreads are wider (0.7 pips). Interactive Brokers dwarfs ActivTrades in scope (150+ markets, real stocks), yet its fees are higher (e.g., $0.005/share commissions) and platforms less beginner-friendly. ActivTrades shines in regulatory strength and platform simplicity, ideal for forex/CFD traders, but lags in asset diversity and passive trading options compared to these multi-asset giants. 19. User Reviews and Ratings On Trustpilot (March 2025), ActivTrades holds a 4.3/5 rating from 1,373 reviews, with users praising fast execution, competitive spreads, and reliable support. Forex Peace Army scores it 3.8/5, commending platform stability and fund safety. Google Reviews echo this at 4.2/5, highlighting educational tools. Common praise centers on transparency, low costs, and regulatory trust. Frequent complaints include slow withdrawal times (1-3 days vs. promised same-day), mediocre weekend support absence, and limited asset variety. Some note currency conversion fees as a hidden cost. Overall, feedback is positive, with gripes typical of regulated brokers balancing compliance and service. 20. Platform Availability by Country ActivTrades operates in over 140 countries, including the UK, EU nations (e.g., Germany, Italy), Australia, South America, and Southeast Asia. Offices in London, Milan, Sofia, and Nassau support its global reach. It caters to diverse regions with multilingual platforms and support. However, it’s unavailable in the US, Canada, Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, and North Korea due to regulatory restrictions or sanctions. Brazil and China require a $500 minimum deposit, reflecting local compliance. Traders should verify availability via the website, as regional entities (e.g., Bahamas vs. UK) affect leverage and asset access. 21. Taxation and Declaring Profits Taxation on ActivTrades profits depends on your country’s laws—e.g., UK traders report CFD gains as capital gains (10-20% rate), while US traders (if eligible via offshore entities) face income tax (up to 37%). ActivTrades doesn’t withhold taxes, leaving declaration to the trader. It provides no formal tax statements, but transaction histories and profit/loss reports are downloadable from the client portal for tax filings. Consult a local tax professional, as CFDs’ non-ownership status often complicates classification (e.g., speculative income vs. investment gains). Record-keeping is key, and ActivTrades’ tools support this, though direct tax assistance is absent. 22. Common Issues and How to Solve Them Login Problems: Forgotten passwords or 2FA issues arise—reset via 'Forgot Password' or contact support with your registered email. Withdrawal Delays: Processing can lag beyond same-day promises—ensure requests are before 12:30 PM GMT and verify bank details; escalate to support if over 3 days. Verification Troubles: Rejected KYC documents (e.g., blurry IDs) stall setup—resubmit clear, valid copies matching your application. Platform Bugs: Lagging charts or execution errors occur—clear cache, update software, or switch devices; report persistent issues to tech support. Proactive communication with ActivTrades resolves most hiccups efficiently. 23. Final Verdict ActivTrades blends regulatory rigor, competitive pricing, and versatile platforms, making it a strong choice for forex and CFD traders. Strengths include tight spreads, top-tier regulation (FCA, SCB), and a $1 million insurance safety net, alongside robust MT4/MT5 tools and a solid demo account. Weaknesses—limited assets (no real stocks/ETFs), no social trading, and weekend support gaps—curb its appeal for passive or multi-asset investors. It’s best for active traders valuing safety and cost-efficiency, from beginners mastering forex to pros leveraging high-volume CFDs. Long-term investors or copy-trading enthusiasts may prefer broader platforms like eToro or Interactive Brokers. 24. FAQs Is ActivTrades regulated?

Trading Tools and Features eToro offers a comprehensive suite of trading tools and features designed to cater to both novice and experienced traders.​ Advanced Charting Tools: eToro's platform is equipped with advanced charting capabilities powered by TradingView. These charts provide real-time data updates multiple times per second, ensuring traders have access to the most current market information. The user-friendly interface offers clear visuals, facilitating quick decision-making. Users can choose from various chart types, such as bars, lines, or candles, and establish timeframes ranging from one minute to a week. Technical Indicators and Drawing Tools: Traders have access to over 100 indicators and more than 50 drawing tools, allowing for in-depth technical analysis. These tools assist in identifying trends, patterns, and potential entry and exit points, enhancing the precision of trading strategies. ​ Economic Calendar: eToro's Economic Calendar keeps users informed about upcoming market events, such as earnings reports, dividend payments, and central bank meetings. This feature enables traders to anticipate market movements and adjust their strategies accordingly. The calendar is customizable, allowing users to filter events based on their relevance to specific assets or markets. ​ Portfolio Breakdown: This tool provides users with a detailed view of their portfolio's composition across asset types, sectors, geographies, and exchanges. It aids in assessing diversification and identifying potential areas for rebalancing. CopyTrader: eToro's signature feature allows users to replicate the trades of experienced investors automatically. This social trading tool is particularly beneficial for beginners seeking to learn from seasoned traders or for those who prefer a more hands-off approach to investing. Smart Portfolios: Formerly known as CopyPortfolios, Smart Portfolios are curated investment strategies that bundle together various assets or top traders based on specific themes or strategies. This feature offers a diversified investment approach without the need for individual asset selection. Virtual Portfolio: eToro provides a virtual trading environment where users can practice trading strategies without risking real capital. This feature is ideal for beginners aiming to build confidence before engaging in live trading. Supported Order Types: eToro supports a variety of order types to accommodate different trading strategies:​ Market Orders: Execute a buy or sell immediately at the current market price.​ Limit Orders: Set a specific price at which to buy or sell an asset. The order is executed only when the market reaches the predetermined price.​ Stop-Loss Orders: Automatically sell an asset when its price reaches a certain level, helping to limit potential losses.​ Trailing Stop Orders: A dynamic stop-loss that adjusts with favorable market movements, locking in profits while protecting against downside risk.​ 12. Leverage and Margin Requirements Leverage allows traders to amplify their market exposure by borrowing funds, while margin refers to the collateral required to maintain leveraged positions.​ Maximum Leverage Available: Retail Clients: eToro adheres to regulatory guidelines that cap leverage for retail clients to mitigate risk:​ Major currency pairs: up to 30:1 Non-major currency pairs, gold, and major indices: up to 20:1 Commodities other than gold and non-major equity indices: up to 10:1 Individual equities: up to 5:1 Cryptocurrencies: up to 2:1 Professional Clients: Traders who meet specific criteria and opt for professional status can access higher leverage levels, up to 400:1, depending on the asset class. However, this classification may result in reduced regulatory protections. ​ Margin Requirements, Margin Calls, and Stop-Out Levels: Margin Requirement: The initial deposit needed to open a leveraged position varies based on the asset and the applied leverage. For example, a 10:1 leverage on a $10,000 position requires a $1,000 margin. ​ Margin Calls: If the equity in a trader's account falls below the required margin due to adverse market movements, eToro may issue a margin call, prompting the trader to deposit additional funds to maintain open positions. ​ Stop-Out Level: Should the account equity decline further and reach a critical threshold, eToro may automatically close positions to prevent the account balance from turning negative. This mechanism protects traders from incurring debts beyond their initial investment. ​ Risks Associated with High Leverage: While leverage can magnify potential profits, it equally amplifies potential losses. High leverage increases exposure to market volatility, which can lead to rapid and substantial losses, potentially exceeding the initial investment. Traders should exercise caution, employ robust risk management strategies, and fully understand the implications of leveraged trading before engaging in such activities. ​ In conclusion, eToro provides a rich array of tools and features to enhance the trading experience, alongside offering leverage options that cater to different trader profiles. However, it's imperative for traders to approach leveraged trading with a thorough understanding of the associated risks and to utilize the platform's risk management tools effectively. 13.

Pros and Cons of eToro eToro, established in 2007, has positioned itself as a prominent player in the online brokerage industry, offering a range of services that appeal to both novice and experienced investors.

Comparison with Other Brokers When evaluating eToro against its competitors, it's essential to consider factors such as fees, platform usability, asset variety, and unique features. Below is a comparison of eToro with three notable brokers: XTB, Trading 212, and Interactive Brokers. 1. XTB Fees: XTB offers commission-free trading on stocks and ETFs, similar to eToro. However, it does not charge withdrawal fees, providing an advantage over eToro's $5 withdrawal fee. ​ Platform: XTB's platform is known for its advanced charting tools and customization options, catering well to experienced traders. In contrast, eToro's platform is more geared towards beginners with its user-friendly interface. Assets: Both brokers offer a diverse range of assets, including forex, commodities, indices, and cryptocurrencies. ​ Features: While eToro excels in social trading, XTB focuses on providing advanced analytical tools and educational resources for traders seeking in-depth market analysis. ​ 2. Trading 212 Fees: Trading 212 offers commission-free trading for stocks and ETFs without any withdrawal fees, making it more cost-effective compared to eToro. ​ Platform: Both platforms are recognized for their intuitive and user-friendly interfaces, suitable for traders at all levels.

However, for traders seeking advanced tools, lower non-trading fees, or access to a broader range of assets, platforms like XTB, Trading 212, or Interactive Brokers may be more suitable.

Taxation and Declaring Profits Taxation Rules for eToro Traders Tax obligations for eToro users vary based on their country of residence and the nature of their trading activities. Generally, profits from trading activities, including capital gains, dividends, and interest, are subject to taxation.

FxPro review	1. Introduction to FxPro FxPro, founded in 2006 and headquartered in London, UK, is a globally recognized online broker specializing in forex and Contracts for Difference (CFDs). With nearly two decades of operation, it has grown to serve over 2 million clients across 170+ countries, executing more than 635 million orders by 2025. FxPro’s mission, as articulated by xAI’s continuous knowledge updates, is to provide cutting-edge trading solutions with a focus on transparency and client satisfaction. The broker operates under FxPro Group Limited, with subsidiaries like FxPro UK Limited and FxPro Financial Services Limited. FxPro is regulated by several top-tier authorities, ensuring robust oversight. FxPro UK Limited is authorized by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) under license number 509956, while FxPro Financial Services Limited falls under the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) with license 078/07. Additional regulation comes from the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) in South Africa (45052), the Securities Commission of the Bahamas (SCB, SIA-F184), and the Financial Services Authority of Seychelles (FSA, SD120). This multi-jurisdictional regulation enhances its credibility. FxPro enjoys a strong reputation for reliability, fast execution, and advanced technology, positioning it as a leader among MetaTrader and cTrader brokers. Its global presence is bolstered by a client base spanning Europe, Asia, Africa, and beyond, with over $100 million in Tier 1 capital as of 2024. Industry awards and partnerships, such as its sponsorship of the McLaren F1 team, underscore its premium market position, appealing to both retail and institutional traders seeking a trusted trading environment. 2. How to Register on FxPro Registering with FxPro is a straightforward process designed for efficiency and compliance. To begin, visit the official FxPro website (fxpro.com) and click 'Register' in the top-right corner. You’ll need to provide basic personal details: full name, email address, phone number, country of residence, and date of birth. After submitting this, a confirmation PIN is sent to your email for verification. Next, complete a short questionnaire about your trading experience and financial knowledge, which helps FxPro tailor its services and meet regulatory requirements. The Know Your Customer (KYC) process follows, requiring identity and address verification. Acceptable identity documents include a passport, national ID, or driver’s license (with a visible signature page). For proof of address, submit a recent utility bill, bank statement, or government-issued document (dated within the last three months) showing your name and address. Upload these via the secure FxPro Direct portal, where they’re typically reviewed within 24-48 hours. Once approved, select your preferred trading platform (e.g., MT4, MT5, cTrader, or FxPro Edge), account type, base currency (e.g., USD, EUR, GBP), and leverage. The process is fully online, user-friendly, and takes about 10-15 minutes, assuming documents are ready. After verification, fund your account with a minimum deposit (starting at $100) to start trading. FxPro’s streamlined registration reflects its commitment to accessibility while adhering to strict anti-money laundering (AML) standards. 3. FxPro Login Process After registering, logging into FxPro is simple via the FxPro Direct portal or trading platforms. Visit fxpro.com, click 'Login,' and enter your registered email and password. For trading platforms like MT4, MT5, or cTrader, use the credentials provided during registration (account number and password), which differ from your FxPro Direct login. The mobile app combines both account management and trading, requiring only your Direct portal credentials. Two-factor authentication (2FA), enabled via email or SMS, adds an extra security layer. Common login issues include forgotten passwords, resolved by clicking 'Forgot Password' and following the reset link sent to your email. Incorrect credentials may stem from confusing Direct portal and platform logins—double-check which is needed. Account lockouts after multiple failed attempts require contacting support (available 24/5) to unlock. Slow internet or outdated app versions can also disrupt access; ensure a stable connection and update software regularly. If 2FA codes don’t arrive, verify your email/phone settings or request a resend. FxPro’s login process is efficient, with clear troubleshooting options. Most issues are user-related (e.g., typos or connectivity) and quickly fixable, though the distinction between portal and platform credentials can confuse beginners. Keeping login details secure and updated minimizes disruptions, ensuring seamless access to trading and account management. 4. Available Account Types FxPro offers a variety of account types tailored to different trader profiles, balancing accessibility and advanced features. The Standard Account, ideal for beginners, requires a $100 minimum deposit and offers commission-free trading with average spreads (e.g., 1.4 pips on EUR/USD). The Raw+ Account, aimed at active traders, also starts at $100 but features tighter spreads (from 0 pips) and a $3.50 commission per lot, optimized for MT4/MT5. The Elite Account, for high-volume traders, demands a $10,000 minimum and provides discounted commissions (e.g., 30% off spreads) plus VIP perks like free VPS access. The cTrader Account, designed for algorithmic traders, requires $100 and offers ultra-low spreads (from 0 pips) with a $35 commission per $1 million traded, exclusive to the cTrader platform. FxPro Edge, a proprietary platform account, mirrors the Standard Account’s $100 minimum and spread-only pricing but adds spread betting for UK traders (tax-free profits). Corporate Accounts cater to businesses, with customizable terms and higher minimums (details via support), while Professional Accounts (for FCA/CySEC clients) unlock higher leverage (up to 1:500) with proof of trading experience and capital. Key differences lie in pricing (spread-only vs. commission-based), platform access, and perks. Standard and Edge suit cost-conscious novices, while Raw+, Elite, and cTrader target scalpers and pros. Minimum deposits are reasonable, though Elite’s threshold reflects its premium focus. Each account supports multiple base currencies (e.g., USD, EUR, GBP), enhancing flexibility. 5. Demo Account Availability FxPro offers a fully functional demo account, providing a risk-free environment to practice trading. Available across all platforms (MT4, MT5, cTrader, FxPro Edge), it mirrors live account conditions, including real-time pricing, spreads, and execution speeds. Beginners can test strategies, while experienced traders explore new markets or platforms. The demo comes preloaded with $10,000 in virtual funds, adjustable upon request, and has no expiration, though inactivity may prompt closure after several months. To open a demo account, visit fxpro.com, click 'Demo Account,' and fill out a brief form (name, email, phone, preferred platform). No KYC is required, making it instant—credentials are emailed within minutes. Select your virtual balance, leverage (up to 1:500), and base currency, then download or access the platform online. Features include full access to charting tools, technical indicators (30+ on MT4/MT5), and order types (market, limit, stop). The cTrader demo adds market depth, appealing to algo traders. FxPro’s demo stands out for its customization and longevity, unlike competitors with time-limited trials. It’s an excellent tool for learning platform navigation, testing EAs (Expert Advisors), or refining risk management. However, it lacks emotional pressure simulation, a common demo limitation. For 2025, it remains a top choice for skill-building, seamlessly transitioning users to live trading once confident. 6. Trading Platform Overview FxPro provides a robust suite of trading platforms catering to diverse styles: MT4, MT5, cTrader, and FxPro Edge, available on web, desktop, and mobile. MetaTrader 4 (MT4) remains a staple with its intuitive interface, 30+ indicators, and EA support, ideal for forex traders. MetaTrader 5 (MT5) builds on this with enhanced charting (21 timeframes), market depth, and broader asset coverage, though its complexity may overwhelm novices. Both offer desktop downloads and web access, with customizable layouts and one-click trading. cTrader targets advanced traders, boasting a sleek design, ultra-low spreads (from 0 pips), and level II pricing. Its desktop version excels in algo trading (via cAlgo), while the web platform retains full functionality. FxPro Edge, the proprietary offering, simplifies trading with a minimalistic web interface and mobile app, featuring TradingView charts (100+ indicators) and spread betting for UK users. It’s less feature-heavy than MT5 or cTrader but shines in usability. The mobile app (FxPro Direct) integrates account management and trading across all platforms, offering economic calendars and basic charting, though it lacks MT4/MT5’s full indicator suite. All platforms prioritize speed (execution under 13ms) and reliability, with customization options like alerts and watchlists. While MT4/MT5 dominate for technical analysis, cTrader and Edge appeal to scalpers and casual traders, respectively. FxPro’s multi-platform approach ensures flexibility, though beginners may prefer Edge’s simplicity over MT5’s learning curve. 7. Markets and Assets Available FxPro offers over 2,100 CFD instruments across multiple markets, though it excludes direct stock ownership, ETFs, options, bonds, and fractional shares due to its CFD focus. Forex trading includes 70+ currency pairs (e.g., EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY), catering to majors, minors, and exotics with competitive spreads. Stocks CFDs cover 1,500+ global companies (e.g., Apple, Tesla, Amazon), available via MT4/MT5 and BnkPro (a separate equity trading app not yet fully global). Cryptocurrency CFDs feature 18+ pairs (e.g., BTC/USD, ETH/USD), though unavailable to UK retail clients under FCA rules. Commodities include spot metals (gold, silver), energies (oil, natural gas), and agricultural products (coffee, sugar), providing diversification. Futures CFDs span 24 contracts (e.g., S&P 500, NASDAQ), while 19 indices (e.g., FTSE 100, DAX 40) track global markets. Unlike some brokers, FxPro doesn’t offer bonds or ETFs, limiting passive investment options. Fractional shares aren’t supported, as CFDs trade full contract sizes. Popular assets like EUR/USD (1.4 pips spread on Standard), gold (0.62 pips), and Bitcoin CFDs attract traders, with MT5 and cTrader expanding choices beyond MT4’s 2249 symbols. While comprehensive for active traders, the lack of non-CFD assets (e.g., real stocks or ETFs) may deter long-term investors. FxPro’s strength lies in its forex and CFD depth, positioning it as a go-to for short-term trading across global markets. 8. Fees and Commissions FxPro’s fee structure varies by account type, balancing competitive trading costs with transparency. The Standard Account (MT4/MT5/Edge) charges no commissions, embedding costs in spreads (e.g., 1.4 pips on EUR/USD, average for the industry). The Raw+ Account offers tighter spreads (from 0 pips) with a $3.50 commission per lot per side ($7 round-turn), competitive for high-volume traders. cTrader Accounts feature even lower spreads (0 pips) and a $35 commission per $1 million traded, appealing to scalpers. Overnight (swap) fees, applied to positions held past 10 PM GMT, are average—e.g., -0.5 pips for EUR/USD long positions. Non-trading fees are minimal: FxPro charges no deposit or withdrawal fees, though third-party providers may apply costs (e.g., 2.6% for Skrill withdrawals without trading). An inactivity fee of $5/month kicks in after six months, plus a $15 one-time maintenance fee, aligning with industry norms (e.g., XM’s $5 inactivity fee). Currency conversion fees apply if your deposit currency mismatches your account base (e.g., INR to USD), typically 0.5-1%, standard across brokers. Compared to peers like XM (1.7 pips EUR/USD) or Pepperstone (0.6 pips with $3.50/lot), FxPro’s Standard spreads are mid-tier, while Raw+ and cTrader rival premium accounts elsewhere. Its no-fee deposits/withdrawals stand out, though swap fees could be lower for long-term holders. Overall, FxPro offers cost-effective trading, especially for active users leveraging Raw+ or cTrader. 9. Deposit and Withdrawal Methods FxPro supports a wide range of deposit options: bank wire transfers (1-5 business days), credit/debit cards (Visa, MasterCard, Maestro—instant), and e-wallets (PayPal, Neteller, Skrill—instant). Local payment methods and crypto deposits (e.g., Bitcoin) are available in some regions, processed via the FxPro Wallet for seamless transfers to trading accounts. The minimum deposit is $100, though $1,000 is recommended for optimal trading. No deposit fees are charged by FxPro, but banks or e-wallets may impose charges (e.g., 2% for Neteller). Withdrawals mirror deposit methods, adhering to AML rules—funds return to the original source up to the deposited amount, with profits via bank wire if needed. Processing is swift: e-wallets and cards take 24 hours, bank transfers 1-5 days. There’s no FxPro withdrawal fee, though a 2.6% charge applies to e-wallet withdrawals without prior trading. Maximum single transactions cap at £10,000 (or equivalent), adjustable with support approval. The FxPro Wallet enhances flexibility, letting traders manage funds across accounts instantly. Timelines beat industry averages (e.g., eToro’s 1-2 days for e-wallets), and fee-free withdrawals outshine brokers like IG, which charge for some methods. Limits are reasonable, though high rollers may need multiple transactions. FxPro’s system prioritizes convenience and speed, making fund management efficient for global traders. 10. Bonuses and Promotions As of March 2025, FxPro does not offer traditional welcome bonuses or deposit matches, aligning with tightened regulations (e.g., FCA/CySEC bans on retail incentives). Instead, it focuses on value-added perks. The VIP Program, for traders depositing $30,000+ over two months, provides up to 30% spread/commission discounts, free VPS access, and priority support—no explicit bonus, but a loyalty scheme enhancing trading conditions. Eligibility requires contacting support to verify volume. A referral program exists: invite friends via a unique link (found in FxPro Direct), and both parties may receive rewards (e.g., reduced spreads or cash credits), though specifics vary by region and are subject to change—check fxpro.com for updates. Terms include a minimum deposit ($100) and trading volume from referees, with rewards withdrawable after meeting conditions (typically 10 lots traded). Unlike brokers like XM, which offer $30 no-deposit bonuses, FxPro’s lack of promotional cash reflects regulatory compliance and a focus on professional traders. The VIP perks carry no wagering requirements beyond maintaining volume, but benefits lapse if activity drops. While appealing to high rollers, beginners may find the absence of entry-level bonuses less enticing. FxPro prioritizes competitive pricing over gimmicks, a trade-off suiting serious traders over casual ones. 11. Trading Tools and Features FxPro equips traders with robust tools across its platforms. MT4 offers 30+ technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD), 9 timeframes, and customizable charts, while MT5 ups this to 38 indicators and 21 timeframes, plus an economic calendar and market depth. cTrader excels with 50+ indicators, level II pricing, and detachable charts, ideal for scalping. FxPro Edge integrates TradingView charts (100+ indicators, 10+ drawing tools), though its mobile version lacks depth. All platforms include real-time quotes, alerts, and one-click trading. Order types are comprehensive: market, limit, stop-loss, and take-profit are standard, with MT5/cTrader adding trailing stops and cTrader supporting advanced stop-limit orders. EAs are supported on MT4/MT5 for automation, and cTrader’s cAlgo enables custom algo development. The FxPro Direct app features a basic economic calendar, though detailed analysis tools reside on desktop platforms. Additional features include VPS for 24/7 trading (free for VIPs, $30/month otherwise) and account analytics (e.g., performance stats, margin levels). Compared to IG’s extensive research suite, FxPro’s tools are trader-focused but lighter on fundamental analysis. They excel for technical traders, offering precision and flexibility, though beginners may need time to master the depth, especially on MT5/cTrader. 12. Leverage and Margin Requirements FxPro offers leverage up to 1:200 for retail clients under SCB/FSCA rules, dropping to 1:30 for FCA/CySEC retail accounts (e.g., 1:30 forex majors, 1:20 minors) due to ESMA restrictions. Professional clients, qualifying via experience and capital (e.g., $500,000 portfolio), access up to 1:500. Leverage varies by asset: 1:100 for commodities, 1:20 for stock CFDs, and 1:10 for crypto CFDs. Margin requirements depend on leverage and position size—e.g., a 1:100 leverage on EUR/USD requires 1% margin ($1,000 for a $100,000 lot). Margin calls trigger at 50% equity-to-margin ratio, urging additional funds, while stop-out levels (30% for SCB, 50% for FCA/CySEC) close positions to limit losses. Negative balance protection ensures losses don’t exceed deposits. High leverage amplifies profits but risks rapid wipeouts—e.g., a 1% move against a 1:200 position doubles your loss relative to capital. FxPro’s tiered system balances opportunity and safety, though novices should start low (1:10-1:30) to mitigate volatility risks. Compared to XM (1:888), FxPro’s caps reflect regulatory prudence, prioritizing client protection over aggressive leverage. 13. Educational Resources FxPro’s educational offerings cater to beginners and intermediates, though they lag behind leaders like IG. The Knowledge Hub includes articles and videos on forex basics, technical analysis (e.g., candlestick patterns), and platform tutorials for MT4/MT5/cTrader. Webinars, held weekly, cover live market analysis and strategy, accessible via registration on fxpro.com. A glossary and FAQs address common terms and queries. Daily market analysis, available on the website and app, provides technical and fundamental insights (e.g., EUR/USD trends, Fed rate impacts), updated by in-house experts. Quality is solid—guides are clear, and videos are concise (5-15 minutes)—but depth is moderate. Advanced topics like hedging or quant trading are sparse, and there’s no progress tracking, unlike eToro’s structured courses. For 2025, the content is practical for onboarding novices and refining skills, with the $10M demo account enhancing hands-on learning. Experienced traders may find it basic, needing external resources for deeper study. FxPro shines in platform-specific training and daily updates, making it a reliable starting point rather than a comprehensive academy. 14. Social and Copy Trading FxPro does not offer a proprietary social or copy trading platform as of March 2025, focusing instead on direct trading tools. However, it supports third-party copy trading via MetaQuotes’ MQL5 community, accessible through MT4/MT5. Register on mql5.com, link your FxPro account, and subscribe to signal providers (fees vary, e.g., $30/month per signal). Performance stats and risk levels are viewable, though FxPro doesn’t curate or guarantee providers. Unlike eToro or ZuluTrade, which integrate social features natively, FxPro’s approach is indirect, requiring external setup. There’s no in-platform trader interaction or leaderboard, limiting social engagement. For copy trading enthusiasts, MT5’s signal service suffices—offering automation and diversification—but lacks the seamless user experience of dedicated platforms. FxPro prioritizes active trading over passive strategies, a gap for beginners seeking hands-off options. 15. Customer Support FxPro provides 24/5 customer support, aligning with forex market hours (Monday 00:00 to Friday 23:59 GMT). Channels include live chat (on fxpro.com and platforms), email (support@fxpro.com), and phone (+44 203 151 5555, with regional numbers). The Help Centre offers a detailed FAQ and video tutorials, covering account setup, withdrawals, and trading issues. Response times are strong—live chat answers within minutes, emails within 6-12 hours, and call-backs (requestable online) are prompt during business hours. Support is multilingual (20+ languages), earning praise for professionalism and clarity. Quality is high, with agents resolving technical queries (e.g., platform errors) efficiently, though 24/7 availability (like IC Markets) would benefit weekend traders. Compared to peers, FxPro’s 24/5 model is standard, but its responsiveness and resource depth outshine slower brokers like XM. For urgent issues, live chat is the fastest route, making support reliable for most trader needs. 16. Safety, Security, and Regulation FxPro operates under stringent oversight from multiple regulators: FCA (509956, UK), CySEC (078/07, Cyprus), FSCA (45052, South Africa), SCB (SIA-F184, Bahamas), and FSA (SD120, Seychelles). This multi-tier regulation ensures compliance with global standards, varying by client entity (e.g., FCA for UK, SCB for others). Client funds are segregated in top-tier banks (e.g., Barclays), separate from company assets, reducing misuse risk. FCA/CySEC clients benefit from investor compensation schemes—up to £85,000 (FSCS) or €20,000 (ICF)—if FxPro fails. Security features include 2FA (email/SMS) on FxPro Direct and platforms, plus SSL encryption for data protection. Negative balance protection caps losses at account equity, a regulatory mandate. With a 19-year track record and $100M+ in Tier 1 capital, FxPro’s Trust Score (90/99 per ForexBrokers.com) reflects high reliability. No major security breaches are reported, making it a safe choice among CFD brokers. 17. Pros and Cons of FxPro Pros: FxPro excels with top-tier regulation (FCA, CySEC), ensuring trust and fund safety. Its platform variety (MT4, MT5, cTrader, Edge) suits all trader types, with fast execution ( Cons: The lack of proprietary copy trading or bonuses may disappoint passive investors or bonus hunters. Educational resources are solid but not advanced, trailing IG or Saxo. Inactivity fees ($5/month after 6 months) and higher stock CFD fees (0.4 pips spread) could irk infrequent traders. Limited non-CFD assets (no ETFs, bonds) restrict long-term investment options. FxPro shines for active traders needing flexibility and reliability, but casual or passive users might find it less comprehensive. 18. Comparison with Other Brokers FxPro vs. XM: FxPro’s $100 minimum matches XM, but XM offers higher leverage (1:888 vs. 1:200) and a $30 no-deposit bonus, appealing to risk-takers. FxPro’s Raw+ (0 pips, $3.50/lot) beats XM’s Ultra Low (0.6 pips, no commission) for scalpers, and its platform range (cTrader, Edge) outshines XM’s MT4/MT5 focus. XM’s education is broader, though. FxPro vs. Pepperstone: Both target pros—Pepperstone’s Razor (0.1 pips, $3.50/lot) rivals FxPro’s Raw+, but Pepperstone’s 1:500 leverage tops FxPro’s 1:200. FxPro’s cTrader and Edge add variety beyond Pepperstone’s MT4/MT5/cTrader trio. Fees are neck-and-neck, but Pepperstone offers 24/7 support vs. FxPro’s 24/5. FxPro vs. eToro: eToro’s social/copy trading and real stocks/ETFs dwarf FxPro’s CFD-only focus and MQL5 integration. FxPro’s spreads (1.4 pips Standard) are tighter than eToro’s (1.9 pips), and its platforms cater to technical traders, unlike eToro’s beginner-friendly app. eToro charges withdrawal fees ($5), FxPro doesn’t. FxPro leads in platform depth and pricing for active traders, trailing in passive options and bonuses. 19. User Reviews and Ratings Recent 2025 reviews on Trustpilot (4.2/5, 796 reviews) praise FxPro’s fast withdrawals (24 hours), tight spreads, and reliable platforms, with users like Sophie (fxleaders.com) lauding its tools and education. Google Reviews echo this, averaging 4.3/5, highlighting 24/5 support responsiveness. Forums like Forex Peace Army note its regulatory strength and execution speed ( Complaints focus on withdrawal delays (occasional 5-day bank waits), complex fee structures for novices, and lack of 24/7 support. Some cTrader users report slippage during volatility, though rare ( 20. Platform Availability by Country FxPro operates in 170+ countries, including the UK, EU (via MiFID passporting), South Africa, Australia, Japan, and India (with currency conversion fees). Key markets like the Netherlands, UAE, and Singapore enjoy full access. The BnkPro app, offering equity trading, is rolling out selectively—check fxpro.com for availability. Restricted regions include the USA, Canada, Iran, and North Korea due to regulatory bans (e.g., CFTC for US) or sanctions. Some features, like crypto CFDs, are unavailable to UK retail clients under FCA rules. Indian traders face KYC scrutiny to ensure leveraged trading comprehension. FxPro’s global reach is broad, with entity-specific compliance (e.g., SCB for non-EU clients). 21. Taxation and Declaring Profits Taxation on FxPro profits depends on your country. In the UK, CFD trading incurs Capital Gains Tax (CGT) unless using spread betting (tax-free); the 2025 CGT allowance is £3,000, with rates at 10-20%. EU traders report gains as income or capital, varying by nation (e.g., Germany’s 25% flat rate). South Africa taxes CFDs as income (up to 45%), while Australia applies CGT (50% discount for 12+ month holds). Consult a local tax advisor, as FxPro doesn’t withhold taxes. FxPro provides no tax statements—download trade history from FxPro Direct to compile gains/losses manually. This aligns with most brokers (e.g., XM, Pepperstone), placing reporting on traders. For spread betting (UK), no documentation is needed beyond personal records. The lack of tax tools may burden novices, but it’s standard for CFD platforms. 22. Common Issues and How to Solve Them Login Problems: Forgotten passwords—use 'Forgot Password' on fxpro.com, reset via email. 2FA delays—check spam or resend code. Solution: Keep credentials updated, contact support (live chat) if locked out. Withdrawal Delays: Bank transfers may take 5 days—verify bank details match deposit source. E-wallet holds (e.g., insufficient trading)—trade 1 lot minimum. Solution: Confirm AML compliance, escalate via email (support@fxpro.com). Verification Troubles: Rejected documents—ensure ID is clear, address proof recent ( Platform Bugs: MT4/MT5 freezes—update software, check internet. cTrader slippage—report to support with screenshots. Solution: Clear cache, reinstall, or switch to web version. Most issues stem from user error or third-party delays, resolvable with proactive steps or 24/5 support. 23. Final Verdict FxPro is a standout broker in 2025, blending top-tier regulation (FCA, CySEC), diverse platforms (MT4, MT5, cTrader, Edge), and competitive pricing (0 pips Raw+). Strengths include fast execution, no deposit/withdrawal fees, and a $10M demo, making it a haven for active traders. Weaknesses—limited education, no native copy trading, and inactivity fees—curb its appeal for beginners or passive investors. It’s ideal for intermediate to advanced traders, especially scalpers and algo enthusiasts, leveraging cTrader or MT5. Beginners benefit from the demo and Edge’s simplicity, but may need external learning. Long-term investors find little here, with no ETFs or real stocks. FxPro’s reliability and tools make it a top pick for serious, hands-on traders. 24. FAQs What is the minimum deposit? $100, though $1,000 is recommended for full features. How long do withdrawals take? 24 hours for e-wallets/cards, 1-5 days for bank transfers. Is FxPro safe? Yes, regulated by FCA, CySEC, with segregated funds and negative balance protection. What are the available trading platforms? MT4, MT5, cTrader, FxPro Edge (web, desktop, mobile). Is FxPro regulated? Yes, by FCA (509956), CySEC (078/07), FSCA (45052), SCB (SIA-F184), FSA (SD120). Are there any inactivity fees? Yes, $5/month after 6 months, plus a $15 one-time fee. Does FxPro support cryptocurrency trading? Yes, 18+ CFD pairs (e.g., BTC/USD), not for UK retail. What are the available contact methods for customer support? Live chat, email (support@fxpro.com), phone (+44 203 151 5555), 24/5.

XTB review	1. Introduction to XTB XTB, founded in 2002 as X-Trade in Poland, has evolved into a leading global brokerage, rebranding to XTB in 2009. Headquartered in Warsaw and London, it’s publicly listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE: XTB), a testament to its transparency and financial stability. With over two decades of operation, XTB serves more than 1 million clients across 13+ countries, including the UK, Germany, and the UAE, cementing its position as a major player in forex and CFD trading. Its growth reflects a focus on technology and client-centric services, earning accolades like 'Best Broker in Europe' from Global Banking & Finance Review. XTB is regulated by top-tier authorities: the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA, license 522157), Poland’s Financial Supervision Authority (KNF), Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC, 169/12), and Belize’s International Financial Services Commission (IFSC, 000302/438). Recent expansions include licenses from Indonesia’s Bappebti and UAE’s SCA in 2024, enhancing its global credibility. XTB’s reputation is strong, bolstered by its regulatory oversight, competitive pricing, and innovative platforms like xStation 5. It ranks among the largest stock exchange-listed CFD brokers worldwide, appealing to both retail and professional traders seeking reliability and variety. 2. How to Register on XTB Registering with XTB is a streamlined process accessible via xtb.com. Start by clicking 'Open an Account,' selecting your region, and choosing between a demo or live account. Provide basic details—full name, email, phone number, and country of residence—then set a password. Next, specify your account type (e.g., Standard) and base currency (USD, EUR, GBP, HUF, or PLN). You’ll answer a brief questionnaire about your trading experience and financial status to ensure suitability, a regulatory requirement. For identity verification (KYC), XTB mandates two documents: a government-issued ID (passport, driver’s license, or national ID) and proof of address (utility bill, bank statement, or tax document, dated within six months). Upload these via the secure client portal after initial registration. Verification typically completes within 24 hours, though delays may occur if documents are unclear or incomplete. Once approved, you receive login credentials via email. The process is user-friendly, designed for beginners, but requires accurate submissions to avoid setbacks, aligning with global anti-money laundering standards. 3. XTB Login Process Logging into XTB post-registration is straightforward. Visit xtb.com or launch the xStation 5 desktop/mobile app, then enter your registered email (or account number) and password. For added security, XTB employs two-factor authentication (2FA), sending a code to your phone or email, which you input to proceed. First-time users may need to reset their initial password via an emailed link. Common login issues include forgotten passwords—use the 'Forgot Password' option to reset via email. Incorrect credentials or platform mismatches (e.g., using MT4 details on xStation) can block access; verify your account details and platform. Slow internet may delay 2FA code delivery—ensure a stable connection. Account lockouts after multiple failed attempts require waiting 15 minutes or contacting support. XTB’s login process is secure and efficient, though 2FA reliance means keeping your registered device handy. 4. Available Account Types XTB offers three main account types tailored to diverse trader needs. The Standard Account, ideal for retail traders, features no commissions on forex and CFDs, spreads from 0.5 pips, and leverage up to 1:30 (EU/UK) or 1:500 (non-EU). No minimum deposit is required, making it beginner-friendly. The Professional Account, for experienced traders, offers tighter spreads (from 0.1 pips) and higher leverage (up to 1:500), but requires eligibility (e.g., $500,000 portfolio, significant trading history) and charges a $3.5/lot commission. The Islamic Account, swap-free for Sharia compliance, mirrors the Standard Account’s features, with no overnight fees, catering to Muslim traders. Differences lie in pricing and leverage: Standard suits cost-conscious novices, Professional targets high-volume traders, and Islamic addresses ethical needs. All accounts include negative balance protection and access to 5,800+ instruments. Corporate accounts aren’t explicitly offered, but institutional solutions can be negotiated. XTB’s flexibility ensures options for all, though beginners may prefer Standard’s simplicity. 5. Demo Account Availability XTB provides a robust demo account, a boon for risk-free practice. Accessible to all, it offers $100,000 in virtual funds, replicating live market conditions across forex, CFDs, and stocks. To open one, visit xtb.com, click 'Demo Account,' and submit your name, email, and phone number. Choose your platform (xStation 5 or MT4) and currency—no full registration is needed initially. Post-signup, it’s unlimited with a live account, though standalone demos last 30 days. Features include real-time quotes, full tool access (e.g., charting, indicators), and customizable leverage, mirroring the live environment. It’s perfect for beginners learning platform navigation or pros testing strategies like scalping. Unlike some brokers capping demo features, XTB’s offering is comprehensive, enhancing its appeal for skill development without financial exposure. 6. Trading Platform Overview XTB’s trading platforms cater to varied preferences. The proprietary xStation 5, available as a web platform, offers a sleek, intuitive interface with TradingView-powered charts, 50+ indicators, and one-click trading. The desktop version (Windows/Mac) adds advanced features like algorithmic trading and deeper customization, though it demands more system resources. The xStation mobile app (iOS/Android) mirrors desktop functionality with real-time quotes, charting, and push notifications, though smaller screens limit multitasking. MetaTrader 4 (MT4) is also available, a favorite for its Expert Advisors (EAs) and 30+ indicators, though its interface feels dated. Both platforms support extensive tools—heatmaps, sentiment indicators, and economic calendars—plus customization like watchlists and layouts. xStation 5 shines for beginners with its simplicity, while MT4 suits automation enthusiasts. Overall, XTB’s platforms are robust, though xStation’s mobile version excels in portability over rivals like MT5-heavy brokers. 7. Markets and Assets Available XTB specializes in CFDs and real assets across multiple markets. Forex offers 57+ pairs (e.g., EUR/USD, USD/JPY), while stocks include 2,022 CFDs (Apple, Tesla) and 3,400+ real shares (UK/EU regions). Cryptocurrencies feature 40 CFDs (Bitcoin, Ethereum), unavailable in the UK due to FCA rules. Commodities cover 27 assets (gold, oil), and indices include 33 globals (S&P 500, DAX). ETFs offer 167 CFDs and 1,350+ real options (e.g., SPY), but bonds and options are absent. Fractional shares are supported for real stocks, enhancing accessibility. Popular assets like EUR/USD, Bitcoin CFDs, and gold attract high volume, backed by tight spreads and fast execution. XTB’s CFD focus suits short-term traders, though its real stock/ETF expansion appeals to investors. Compared to multi-asset giants like Interactive Brokers, its range is narrower but robust for CFD enthusiasts. 8. Fees and Commissions XTB’s fees are competitive, with trading costs centered on spreads. Standard Accounts feature no commissions, with forex spreads from 0.5 pips (EUR/USD averages 0.9 pips), below the industry’s 1.0-1.2 pips. Professional Accounts charge $3.5/lot per side ($7 round-turn) but offer tighter spreads (0.1 pips). Overnight swap fees apply to positions held past 5 PM EST, varying by asset (e.g., negative for long forex positions). Stock CFDs are commission-free up to €100,000 monthly turnover, then 0.2% (min. €10). Non-trading fees include a €10 monthly inactivity charge after 12 months, standard in the industry. Withdrawals are free above €100; below that, fees apply (e.g., €20 for bank transfers). Currency conversion costs 0.5%, typical for multi-currency accounts. Compared to eToro or FxPro, XTB’s spreads and no-commission structure favor cost-conscious traders, though inactivity fees may irk infrequent users. 9. Deposit and Withdrawal Methods XTB supports deposits via bank transfers, credit/debit cards (Visa, Mastercard), and e-wallets (PayPal, Skrill, Neteller, region-dependent). No minimum deposit applies, except in specific jurisdictions. Deposits are instant for cards/e-wallets, while bank transfers take 1-3 days, all fee-free from XTB’s side (bank charges may apply). Withdrawals, requested via the client portal, process same-day if submitted before 1 PM GMT, otherwise next day. Bank transfers take 1-3 days, e-wallets/cards are faster (hours). No fees apply above €100; below, charges vary (e.g., €20 for wires). No strict limits exist, though large sums may trigger verification. XTB’s process is efficient, but lacks crypto payment options, unlike some rivals, balancing speed and cost well. 10. Bonuses and Promotions In 2025, XTB’s bonuses are limited by FCA/ESMA regulations banning retail incentives. Non-EU entities (e.g., Belize) may offer promotions like a 10% deposit bonus (up to $500) for $100+ deposits, tied to trading volume (e.g., 10 lots in 90 days). Bonuses are non-withdrawable, and unmet conditions void them—check xtb.com for updates. The referral program rewards clients up to $500 per friend who deposits and trades, with no cap, subject to regional terms. Loyalty schemes are absent, though high-volume traders can negotiate discounts. Compared to offshore brokers, XTB’s offerings are modest, prioritizing compliance over flashy perks, appealing to regulated-market traders. 11. Trading Tools and Features XTB’s tools enhance trading precision. xStation 5 offers 50+ indicators (RSI, Bollinger Bands), advanced charting, and an economic calendar. The Stocks Scanner filters assets by metrics like P/E ratio, while Market Sentiment shows client positions. MT4 adds EAs for automation. Order types include market, limit, stop-loss, trailing stop, and take-profit, with xStation’s heatmap and calculator aiding risk management. These tools suit beginners (intuitive design) and pros (algorithmic options), though historical data is limited versus platforms like TradingView. XTB’s proprietary features, like real-time statistics, give it an edge for active traders seeking actionable insights. 12. Leverage and Margin Requirements XTB offers leverage up to 1:30 for retail clients (EU/UK, e.g., 3.33% margin on forex majors) and 1:500 for professionals (0.2% margin), varying by asset (e.g., 1:10 for stocks). Margin calls trigger at 100% usage, with stop-out at 50%, closing positions to limit losses. Negative balance protection ensures no debt. High leverage boosts potential returns—a $1,000 position at 1:500 controls $500,000—but a 0.2% move wipes it out. Beginners should start low, as volatility amplifies risk. XTB’s caps align with regulatory norms, offering flexibility with safeguards, though less aggressive than offshore brokers. 13. Educational Resources XTB’s Trading Academy delivers 200+ lessons, from forex basics to advanced strategies, via videos, articles, and quizzes. Weekly webinars cover live analysis, while tutorials explain platform tools. Quality is high—clear, practical, and multilingual—ideal for beginners and intermediates. Daily market updates and technical reports provide actionable insights, though depth lags behind IG’s offerings. The content is well-structured, with real-world examples, but lacks formal courses or certifications. For novices building skills or traders seeking market context, XTB’s resources are robust and accessible, enhancing its educational appeal. 14. Social and Copy Trading XTB does not offer social or copy trading in 2025, focusing on self-directed trading via xStation 5 and MT4. Unlike eToro or ZuluTrade, it lacks platforms to mimic expert trades or share strategies, reflecting its regulatory stance and active-trader focus. MT4’s MQL5 signals are available third-party, but not broker-integrated. This gap may disappoint passive investors, though XTB’s toolset compensates for hands-on traders prioritizing control. 15. Customer Support XTB provides 24/5 support via live chat, email (uksupport@xtb.com), and phone (+44 203 936 3888), matching forex market hours. Multilingual assistance spans English, Spanish, Arabic, and more. Live chat responds within minutes, email within 24 hours, and phone offers instant help, with agents praised for expertise. Weekend support is unavailable, a norm among peers like FxPro. Testing shows reliable, polite service, though complex issues may require escalation. For most traders, XTB’s support is responsive and effective, especially during active hours. 16. Safety, Security, and Regulation XTB is overseen by FCA (522157), KNF, CySEC (169/12), IFSC (000302/438), plus Bappebti and SCA (2024 additions). Client funds are segregated at Tier-1 banks, protected by FSCS (£85,000 in the UK) and ICF (€20,000 in the EU). Security includes 2FA, SSL encryption, and regular audits. Negative balance protection caps losses at deposits. This multi-layered oversight and insurance outshine many competitors, ensuring high safety for funds and data, appealing to risk-averse traders globally. 17. Pros and Cons of XTB Pros: Competitive spreads (0.5 pips), no deposit fees, and 5,800+ instruments. Top-tier regulation (FCA, CySEC), $85,000 fund protection, and xStation 5’s usability shine. Robust education and demo accounts aid beginners. Cons: CFD-heavy focus excludes bonds/options. No social trading, weekend support, or ISA/SIPP (UK). Inactivity fees (€10/month) and limited base currencies (5) may deter some. 18. Comparison with Other Brokers Versus eToro, XTB offers lower spreads (0.9 vs. 1.0 pips) but lacks social trading; eToro’s asset range includes real crypto. IG provides broader markets (bonds, options) and 24/7 support, though fees are higher (1.2 pips). FxPro matches XTB’s platforms (MT4/5) but charges wider spreads (1.4 pips). XTB excels in cost and regulation, ideal for CFD traders, while rivals suit diverse or passive needs. 19. User Reviews and Ratings Trustpilot (4.0/5, 865 reviews) lauds XTB’s low fees, platform ease, and support, though withdrawal delays (1-3 days) draw ire. Google Reviews (4.1/5) echo pricing praise but note limited assets. Forums like Forex Peace Army (3.7/5) highlight reliability, with gripes on inactivity fees. Users value cost-efficiency and safety, but expect faster payouts. 20. Platform Availability by Country XTB operates in 140+ countries, including the UK, EU, UAE, and Indonesia (2025 launch). It’s unavailable in the US, Canada, Japan, and sanctioned nations (e.g., Iran, North Korea) due to regulatory barriers. EU/UK clients face stricter leverage (1:30), while non-EU enjoy 1:500. Verify eligibility on xtb.com. 21. Taxation and Declaring Profits Taxation varies by jurisdiction—UK traders report CFD gains as capital gains (10-20%), while others treat it as income (e.g., 37% max in some regions). XTB doesn’t withhold taxes or provide tax statements, but offers downloadable transaction reports for filing. Consult a tax expert, as CFD complexity affects declarations. XTB’s tools aid record-keeping, not tax prep. 22. Common Issues and How to Solve Them Login Problems: Reset forgotten passwords via email; ensure correct platform/credentials. Withdrawal Delays: Submit before 1 PM GMT for same-day processing; verify bank details. Verification Issues: Resubmit clear ID/address proof if rejected. Platform Bugs: Update software, clear cache, or contact support. Proactive steps and support resolve most efficiently. 23. Final Verdict XTB blends low costs, strong regulation, and versatile platforms, excelling for forex and CFD traders. Strengths—tight spreads, robust tools, and safety—outweigh cons like limited assets and no social trading. It suits beginners (education, demo) and active traders (pricing, leverage), less so for long-term investors needing ISAs or bonds. A top pick for cost-conscious, self-directed traders. 24. FAQs What is the minimum deposit? $0 globally, region-dependent exceptions apply. How long do withdrawals take? Same-day if before 1 PM GMT, 1-3 days otherwise. Is XTB safe? Yes, regulated by FCA, CySEC, with segregated funds and protection. What are the available trading platforms? xStation 5 and MT4. Is XTB regulated? Yes, by FCA (522157), KNF, CySEC (169/12), and more. Are there any inactivity fees? €10/month after 12 months. Does XTB support cryptocurrency trading? Yes, CFDs (e.g., Bitcoin), not in UK. What are the available contact methods for customer support? Live chat, email (uksupport@xtb.com), phone (+44 203 936 3888).

CMC Markets review	1. Introduction to CMC Markets CMC Markets, founded in 1989 by Peter Cruddas in London, has grown from a small forex trading firm into a global leader in online brokerage. Listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE: CMCX), it boasts a market capitalization exceeding £470 million as of 2024, reflecting its financial stability. With over 35 years of experience, CMC Markets serves more than 152,000 active clients worldwide through 14 offices, including London, Sydney, and Singapore. Renowned for its innovative Next Generation platform, it holds a strong market position in forex and CFD trading, competing with giants like IG and Saxo Bank. The broker is regulated by multiple top-tier authorities, ensuring trust and compliance. CMC Markets UK PLC is overseen by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA, license 173730), while its Australian arm operates under the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC, license 238054). Additional licenses include Canada’s CIRO, Singapore’s MAS (UEN 200605050E), New Zealand’s FMA, Germany’s BaFin, and Dubai’s DFSA. This robust regulatory framework, paired with its long history and public listing, bolsters its reputation as a secure, reliable broker, appealing to traders seeking a well-established platform with a global footprint. 2. How to Register on CMC Markets Registering with CMC Markets is a user-friendly process accessible via cmcmarkets.com. Start by clicking 'Create Account,' selecting your country, and choosing between a CFD, spread betting (UK/Ireland only), or stockbroking account. Provide personal details—full name, email, phone number, and address—then select a base currency (e.g., USD, EUR, GBP). You’ll complete a brief questionnaire assessing trading experience and financial status, a regulatory necessity to ensure suitability. The Know Your Customer (KYC) process requires two documents: a government-issued ID (passport, driver’s license, or national ID) and proof of address (utility bill or bank statement, dated within three months). Upload these via the secure client portal post-registration. Verification typically takes 24-48 hours, though delays may occur if documents are unclear. Once approved, you’ll receive login credentials via email. The process is straightforward, designed for accessibility, but beginners should ensure document clarity to avoid setbacks, aligning with global AML standards. 3. CMC Markets Login Process Logging into CMC Markets is simple after registration. Visit cmcmarkets.com or open the Next Generation platform or mobile app, then enter your email (or account number) and password. Two-factor authentication (2FA) enhances security, requiring a code sent to your phone or email. First-time users may need to reset their initial password via an emailed link. Common login issues include forgotten passwords—resolve this by selecting 'Forgot Password' and following prompts. Incorrect credentials or platform mismatches (e.g., using MT4 details on Next Generation) can block access; verify details and platform choice. Slow connections may delay 2FA codes—ensure stable internet. Multiple failed attempts trigger a temporary lockout; wait 15 minutes or contact support. The process is secure and efficient, though 2FA reliance means keeping your registered device accessible. 4. Available Account Types CMC Markets offers diverse account types. The Standard CFD Account suits retail traders, with no minimum deposit, spreads from 0.7 pips, and leverage up to 1:30 (EU/UK). The FX Active Account, for forex-focused traders, offers spreads from 0.0 pips on six pairs, a $2.50/lot commission, and no minimum deposit. Spread Betting Accounts (UK/Ireland only) feature tax-free trading, spreads from 0.3 pips, and 1:30 leverage. The Professional Account, for eligible traders, provides up to 1:500 leverage and rebates, requiring significant experience or funds (e.g., $500,000 portfolio). Stockbroking Accounts (Australia) enable real share trading with $0 brokerage on trades under $1,000 daily. Corporate Accounts cater to businesses, with tailored terms. Key differences include tax treatment (spread betting), pricing (FX Active’s commissions), and leverage (Professional’s higher caps). All offer negative balance protection, but Professional accounts demand expertise. Beginners favor Standard CFDs for simplicity, while pros opt for specialized accounts. 5. Demo Account Availability CMC Markets offers a robust demo account, ideal for practice. Available to all, it provides £10,000 in virtual funds, mirroring live conditions across forex, CFDs, and stocks (Australia). To open one, visit cmcmarkets.com, click 'Demo Account,' and enter your name, email, and phone number. Choose your platform (Next Generation or MT4)—no full registration is needed initially. Post-signup, it’s unlimited with a live account; standalone demos last 30 days. Features include real-time quotes, full tool access (e.g., charting, indicators), and customizable leverage, replicating the live environment. It’s perfect for beginners mastering navigation or pros testing strategies like hedging. Unlike some brokers, CMC doesn’t limit demo functionality, making it a standout for risk-free skill-building. 6. Trading Platform Overview CMC Markets offers two primary platforms. The Next Generation platform, available as web and desktop versions, features an intuitive interface, TradingView-powered charts, 115+ indicators, and customizable layouts. Its desktop version (Windows/Mac) adds algorithmic trading, though it’s resource-intensive. MetaTrader 4 (MT4), a desktop and web option, excels in automation with Expert Advisors (EAs) and 30+ indicators, but its design feels dated. The mobile app (iOS/Android) for Next Generation mirrors desktop features—real-time quotes, charting, one-click trading—though smaller screens limit multitasking. Both platforms offer robust tools like sentiment indicators and news feeds, with Next Generation standing out for innovation and MT4 for familiarity. Customization is extensive, from watchlists to chart patterns, though Next Generation’s mobile experience outshines MT4’s. Beginners prefer Next Generation’s ease, while pros leverage MT4’s automation. 7. Markets and Assets Available CMC Markets specializes in CFDs and spread betting, with over 12,000 instruments. Forex includes 330+ pairs (e.g., EUR/USD, GBP/JPY), stocks offer 9,000+ CFDs (Apple, Tesla) and real shares (Australia only), and cryptocurrencies feature 18 CFDs (Bitcoin, Ethereum) outside the UK. Commodities cover 100+ assets (gold, oil), indices include 80+ globals (S&P 500, FTSE 100), and ETFs offer 1,000+ CFDs (SPY). Options trading (introduced 2024) and treasuries are available, but bonds and fractional shares (beyond Australia) are absent. Popular assets like EUR/USD, gold, and Tesla CFDs drive volume, supported by tight spreads. The CFD focus suits short-term traders, though real asset limitations may deter long-term investors compared to multi-asset brokers like Interactive Brokers. 8. Fees and Commissions CMC Markets’ fees are competitive. Standard CFD Accounts charge no commissions, with spreads from 0.7 pips (EUR/USD averages 0.9 pips), below the industry’s 1.0-1.2 pips. FX Active Accounts offer 0.0 pips on majors, with a $2.50/lot commission per side. Stock CFDs incur 0.1% commissions (min. $10), higher than IC Markets’ 0.02%. Overnight fees (swaps) apply post-5 PM EST, varying by asset. Real stock trades (Australia) are $0 under $1,000 daily, then $11 or 0.1%. Non-trading fees include a £10 monthly inactivity charge after 12 months, standard across peers. Withdrawals are free, but currency conversion costs 0.5%. Compared to IG (1.2 pips) or FxPro (1.4 pips), CMC’s forex pricing excels, though stock CFD fees lag behind cheaper rivals. 9. Deposit and Withdrawal Methods CMC Markets supports deposits via bank transfers, credit/debit cards (Visa, Mastercard), and PayPal (region-dependent). No minimum deposit applies, except for specific jurisdictions. Deposits are instant for cards/PayPal, 1-2 days for bank transfers, all fee-free from CMC (bank charges may apply). Withdrawals, requested via the client portal, process same-day if submitted before 2 PM GMT, otherwise next day. Bank transfers take 1-3 days, cards/PayPal are faster (hours). No fees apply, though conversions incur 0.5%. No strict limits exist, but large withdrawals may require verification. The process is efficient, though crypto payments are unsupported, unlike some competitors. 10. Bonuses and Promotions CMC Markets offers limited bonuses due to FCA/ESMA restrictions on retail incentives. Non-EU regions may see promotions like a 10% deposit bonus (up to $500) for $200+ deposits, tied to trading volume (e.g., 10 lots in 60 days). Bonuses are non-withdrawable, and unmet terms void them—check cmcmarkets.com for availability. The Alpha program provides up to 40% spread discounts for active traders (e.g., £500+ monthly volume), with no formal referral scheme. Compared to offshore brokers, CMC’s perks are modest, prioritizing compliance over aggressive incentives, suiting regulated-market traders. 11. Trading Tools and Features CMC Markets equips traders with robust tools. Next Generation offers 115+ indicators (RSI, MACD), 70+ chart patterns, and an economic calendar. MT4 adds EAs and 30+ indicators. Features include sentiment data, Reuters news, and pattern recognition alerts. Order types include market, limit, stop-loss, trailing stop, and guaranteed stop-loss orders (GSLOs, with a refundable fee). These tools balance accessibility for beginners (e.g., intuitive charts) and depth for pros (e.g., algorithmic trading), though historical data is less extensive than TradingView’s. GSLOs enhance risk management, making CMC a strong choice for active traders. 12. Leverage and Margin Requirements CMC Markets offers 1:30 leverage for retail clients (EU/UK, 3.33% margin on forex) and up to 1:500 for professionals (0.2% margin), varying by asset (e.g., 1:5 for stocks). Margin calls trigger at 100%, with stop-out at 50%, closing positions to prevent negative balances, which are protected. High leverage amplifies gains—a $1,000 position at 1:500 controls $500,000—but a 0.2% move erases it. Beginners should use low leverage, as volatility heightens risk. CMC’s caps balance opportunity and safety, though they’re less aggressive than offshore brokers. 13. Educational Resources CMC Markets’ 'Learn' section offers videos, articles, and webinars on forex, CFDs, and risk management. Beginners access foundational guides, while intermediates benefit from strategy-focused webinars. Quality is high—practical, multilingual, and regularly updated—though structured courses are absent. Daily market analysis, including 'The Week Ahead' videos and Morningstar reports, provides actionable insights. Compared to IG’s deeper research, CMC’s content is robust but less granular. It’s ideal for novices building skills and traders seeking market context, enhancing platform value. 14. Social and Copy Trading CMC Markets supports limited copy trading via MT4’s third-party signals (e.g., MQL5), but lacks a proprietary social or copy trading platform as of 2025. Unlike eToro or ZuluTrade, it prioritizes self-directed trading on Next Generation and MT4. This gap may frustrate passive investors, though active traders benefit from its toolset. The absence reflects regulatory focus and a niche targeting hands-on users. 15. Customer Support CMC Markets offers 24/5 support via phone (+44 207 170 8200), email (clientservices@cmcmarkets.com), and live chat, matching forex hours. Multilingual assistance spans English, Spanish, and more. Live chat responds in minutes, email within 24 hours, and phone is instant, with agents lauded for expertise. Weekend support is unavailable, typical among peers. Testing confirms reliable, professional service, though complex issues may require follow-ups. For active traders, CMC’s support is solid, especially during market hours. 16. Safety, Security, and Regulation CMC Markets is regulated by FCA (173730), ASIC (238054), CIRO, MAS (200605050E), FMA, BaFin, and DFSA. Client funds are segregated at Tier-1 banks, protected by FSCS (£85,000 UK) or equivalent schemes. Security includes 2FA, SSL encryption, and negative balance protection. This multi-jurisdictional oversight and robust measures outshine many rivals, ensuring fund safety and data security, ideal for cautious traders globally. 17. Pros and Cons of CMC Markets Pros: Tight spreads (0.7 pips), 12,000+ instruments, and top-tier regulation (FCA, ASIC). Next Generation’s innovation, zero deposit fees, and GSLOs enhance appeal. Strong education and demo accounts aid beginners. Cons: High stock CFD fees (0.1%), no real stocks/ETFs (outside Australia), and no 24/7 support. Limited base currencies (10) and no proprietary copy trading may deter some. 18. Comparison with Other Brokers Versus IG, CMC offers lower forex spreads (0.9 vs. 1.2 pips) but fewer real assets; IG provides 24/7 support. Saxo Bank excels in multi-asset trading (stocks, bonds), though fees are higher. FxPro matches MT4 support but lags in proprietary platform innovation. CMC shines in pricing and regulation, suiting CFD traders, while rivals cater to broader or passive needs. 19. User Reviews and Ratings Trustpilot (4.2/5, 1,200+ reviews) praises CMC’s spreads, platform, and support, though withdrawal delays (1-3 days) and stock CFD costs draw criticism. Google Reviews (4.0/5) echo pricing benefits, with mobile app lag noted. Forums like Forex Peace Army (3.9/5) laud reliability but flag inactivity fees. Users value cost and trust, expecting faster payouts. 20. Platform Availability by Country CMC Markets operates in 70+ countries, including the UK, Australia, Canada, Singapore, and EU nations. It’s unavailable in the US, Mexico, and sanctioned regions (e.g., Iran, North Korea) due to regulatory bans on CFDs. EU/UK clients face 1:30 leverage, non-EU up to 1:500. Check cmcmarkets.com for eligibility. 21. Taxation and Declaring Profits Taxation varies—UK spread betting is tax-free, CFD gains are capital gains (10-20%). Elsewhere, profits may be income (e.g., 37% max). CMC doesn’t withhold taxes or provide statements, but offers transaction reports for filing. Consult a tax expert, as CFD complexity affects declarations. CMC’s tools aid record-keeping, not tax prep. 22. Common Issues and How to Solve Them Login Problems: Reset passwords via email; ensure correct platform. Withdrawal Delays: Submit before 2 PM GMT; verify details. Verification Issues: Resubmit clear ID/proof. Platform Bugs: Update software, clear cache, or contact support. Proactive steps and support resolve most efficiently. 23. Final Verdict CMC Markets excels with low spreads, vast CFDs, and top regulation, offset by high stock CFD fees and limited real assets. It’s best for active forex/CFD traders (beginners via education, pros via tools), less so for long-term investors needing stocks/ETFs. A premier choice for cost-conscious, self-directed traders. 24. FAQs What is the minimum deposit? $0 globally, jurisdiction-dependent exceptions apply. How long do withdrawals take? Same-day if before 2 PM GMT, 1-3 days otherwise. Is CMC Markets safe?

Hamas rejects Trump threat, demands lasting truce for hostage rel...	Hamas has dismissed the latest warning from President Donald Trump and restated its position that the release of the remaining Israeli hostages will only happen as part of a broader agreement that guarantees a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. The militant group accused both Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of attempting to walk away from the ceasefire deal agreed in January. That initial agreement outlined a phased process, where the release of additional hostages would coincide with the release of more Palestinian prisoners, the implementation of a lasting ceasefire, and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. A spokesperson for Hamas, Abdel-Latif al-Qanoua, said the most effective path to securing the hostages’ release would be to restart talks on the next stage of the agreement. Negotiations on that phase were supposed to begin in early February but so far have only reached the stage of preliminary discussions. Trump Issues Final Threat as Pressure Mounts Tensions escalated further after Trump posted a blunt warning on his social media platform following a meeting with eight former hostages. Trump called on Hamas to immediately release all remaining hostages and return the bodies of those who were killed, warning that failure to comply would result in severe consequences. The Trump administration has also confirmed that, for the first time, direct talks were held between the U.S. and Hamas representatives. Despite these rare contacts, there is little clarity on whether any progress was made. Hamas still holds 24 living hostages who were taken during the October 7, 2023 attack, including Israeli-American citizen Edan Alexander. In addition to the living captives, the group is believed to be holding the bodies of 34 others, including people killed either during the initial assault or while in captivity, as well as the remains of a soldier killed in the 2014 conflict. The first phase of the ceasefire, which lasted 42 days and ended recently, saw Hamas release 25 Israeli hostages along with the bodies of eight others. In return, nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners were freed. Israel, backed by the Trump administration, now supports a revised U.S. proposal for the second phase. Under this new plan, Hamas would release half of the remaining hostages immediately, with the rest being freed once a permanent ceasefire is negotiated. Hamas has rejected this revised plan, insisting on the terms of the original January agreement. Escalating Pressure and Humanitarian Crisis To force Hamas to reconsider, Israel has imposed a near-total blockade on Gaza, cutting off essential supplies such as food, fuel, and medicine to the enclave’s population of around 2 million people. Israel has also warned of additional punitive measures if Hamas does not resume hostage releases under the new framework. It remains unclear whether the direct U.S.-Hamas talks have made any headway. Trump’s administration continues to support Israel’s two core objectives — recovering all remaining hostages and completely dismantling Hamas — objectives that may ultimately be incompatible with any lasting ceasefire. The October 7 attack led by Hamas resulted in approximately 1,200 deaths, most of them civilians, while 251 hostages were taken during the assault. Since then, many of those hostages have been released through negotiated agreements or rescue operations carried out by Israeli forces, which have successfully freed eight living hostages and recovered the bodies of dozens more. The ongoing Israeli military campaign in Gaza has caused widespread devastation, with over 48,000 Palestinians reported killed, most of them women and children according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. Israel claims it has killed more than 17,000 militants, though it has not publicly provided evidence to support that number. Large areas of Gaza lie in ruins, and the majority of the population has been displaced, with many living in makeshift shelters, schools, and damaged buildings. Humanitarian groups warn that hundreds of thousands of people remain entirely dependent on international aid for survival, with conditions worsening due to Israel’s restrictions on supplies entering the region.The post Hamas rejects Trump threat, demands lasting truce for hostage release first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hamas-rejects-trump-threat-demands-lasting-truce/	2025-03-06T05:51:18-08:00	
Deal reached to appoint Rudolph Haykal as army chief	An agreement has been finalized to appoint Major General Rudolph Haykal as the new commander of the Lebanese army, according to a senior government source. The remaining security-related appointments are expected to be completed in the coming week, following further discussions within government circles. The source indicated there are no major disputes surrounding these security appointments. The current plan is to allow General Security’s acting chief, Major General Elias Bayssari, to continue in his role until the conclusion of his extended term, ensuring continuity in that sensitive position. Central Bank Governor Role and Further Discussions While progress has been made on military and security leadership roles, the nomination process for the next Central Bank governor has yet to be formally addressed. Discussions on that appointment are expected to take place at a later stage as political negotiations continue. Separately, there is speculation that Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri may travel to Baabda to meet with President Joseph Aoun to review the remaining appointments. However, by late Wednesday evening, the visit had not been officially confirmed. Disagreements over certain positions, particularly in General Security and State Security, have slowed the process and may ultimately prevent the issue from being raised outside the formal cabinet agenda at the next government session.The post Deal reached to appoint Rudolph Haykal as army chief first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/deal-appoint-rudolph-haykal-army-chief/	2025-03-06T05:51:03-08:00	
Doha rejects Israeli claim linking Qatari aid to October 7 attack	Qatar has rejected accusations made by Israel’s domestic security agency, Shin Bet, which alleged that financial aid from Qatar contributed to the strengthening of Hamas’s military capabilities ahead of the October 7, 2023 attack. Qatar dismissed these claims as false and described them as politically motivated attempts to deflect blame. The statement from Qatar’s International Media Office accused Israeli authorities of using the allegations for political cover within Israel, particularly after Shin Bet released an internal review acknowledging its own failures in preventing the large-scale cross-border assault. That attack, launched from Gaza into southern Israel, triggered more than a year of devastating conflict in the Palestinian territory. In its internal review, Shin Bet highlighted what it called the influx of Qatari funds as a significant factor that enabled Hamas to enhance its military strength, which ultimately made the October 7 attack possible. Qatar firmly denied the claim, saying that all financial aid it provided to Gaza was transferred with the full knowledge, approval, and oversight of both the current and previous Israeli governments, as well as their security agencies, including Shin Bet. Qatar emphasized that none of its financial assistance was ever delivered to Hamas’s political leadership or its military wing. Since 2012, Qatar has hosted Hamas’s political office in Doha with the approval of the United States, a role that has drawn criticism from some quarters, despite Qatar’s repeated denials that it supports the group’s armed activities. The Gulf state has played a central role as a mediator in ceasefire talks between Hamas and Israel, working alongside the United States and Egypt. Qatar’s mediation efforts were crucial in establishing a fragile truce that held for several weeks, allowing for exchanges of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. However, following the conclusion of the truce’s initial phase, the process has reached a deadlock, with both sides unable to agree on terms for extending the calm. Qatar’s statement called on Israeli security services to prioritize the safe return of the remaining hostages and work toward long-term regional stability, instead of making what it described as baseless allegations designed to distract from Israel’s own failings. Qatar reiterated that accusations linking its aid to Hamas were completely unfounded and argued that such claims only serve to prolong the ongoing conflict. The October 7 assault by Hamas led to the deaths of 1,218 people, the majority of them civilians. In response, Israel’s sustained military campaign in Gaza has resulted in the deaths of at least 48,405 people, with most of those killed also believed to be civilians, according to figures from both sides.The post Doha rejects Israeli claim linking Qatari aid to October 7 attack first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/doha-rejects-israeli-claim-qatari-october-7/	2025-03-05T08:16:09-08:00	
Israel’s mission against Hamas unfinished, says new military chie...	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with Israel’s new military chief, Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir, to mark the official handover of command at the Israel Defense Forces headquarters in Tel Aviv. During the ceremony, Netanyahu stressed that Israel remains fully committed to securing victory in the ongoing multi-front conflict, which erupted following Hamas’s large-scale attack in October 2023. Netanyahu made it clear that Zamir will play a crucial role in shaping the outcome of the war, noting that the decisions made and actions taken now will have long-lasting effects on the future security and stability of the country. In his first remarks after assuming his new role, Zamir acknowledged the damage inflicted on Hamas during months of military operations but admitted that the group has not yet been fully neutralized. He described defeating Hamas as a mission still underway and said that eliminating the threat posed by the group remains a top priority for the Israeli military. The leadership transition comes at a particularly sensitive time, with negotiations over a potential second phase of the fragile ceasefire with Hamas remaining deadlocked. Tensions between both sides continue to simmer, with Israel demanding the complete disarmament of Hamas and the release of all hostages still held in Gaza before agreeing to any long-term truce. Zamir, who now serves as the IDF’s 24th Chief of Staff, brings decades of military experience to the role. Having first joined the Armored Corps in the mid-1980s, he rose steadily through the ranks, holding senior command roles including leadership of the Southern Command — the area responsible for security along the Gaza border. Most recently, he served as Director-General of the Ministry of Defense, giving him experience working at the highest levels of Israel’s security and defense infrastructure. His appointment is taking place in the shadow of internal reviews conducted after the October 2023 attack, which exposed severe intelligence and operational failures that left southern Israel vulnerable. While Hamas’s initial assault triggered a devastating Israeli response, including sustained airstrikes and ground operations in Gaza, the group has continued to maintain pockets of resistance, and several hostages remain in captivity. During the ceremony, Netanyahu expressed full confidence in Zamir’s leadership abilities, citing their previous work together and praising his operational expertise and deep understanding of Israel’s security landscape. The Prime Minister said that under Zamir’s command, the military would continue to adapt to evolving threats while also seizing strategic opportunities to strengthen Israel’s position both regionally and internationally. As Zamir takes charge, the military faces the dual challenge of ensuring operational success on the ground while also managing mounting international scrutiny over Israel’s conduct during the conflict. Allegations of war crimes and humanitarian violations have been raised by international bodies, adding further complexity to the military’s ongoing operations. The months ahead will test Zamir’s leadership as the Israeli military attempts to balance the immediate need to protect its citizens with long-term efforts to reshape the security environment in Gaza and across the wider region.The post Israel’s mission against Hamas unfinished, says new military chief first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israels-mission-hamas-unfinished-new-military-chief/	2025-03-05T08:16:00-08:00	
Egypt unveils $53bn Gaza rebuild plan as Arab leaders gather in C...	Egypt has unveiled a comprehensive $53 billion initiative to reconstruct the Gaza Strip over a five-year period, focusing on immediate relief, infrastructure rehabilitation, and sustainable economic growth. This proposal is set to be deliberated at an extraordinary Arab summit in Cairo, presenting a stark alternative to U.S. President Donald Trump's recent suggestion to assume control of Gaza and relocate its Palestinian inhabitants to neighboring countries such as Egypt and Jordan. Phased Reconstruction Strategy The Egyptian plan is structured into two primary phases: an early recovery phase and a subsequent reconstruction phase. Early Recovery Phase: Spanning six months with an estimated budget of $3 billion, this phase aims to address immediate needs by removing unexploded ordnance, clearing debris, and providing temporary housing solutions. To accommodate the displaced population, the plan proposes establishing seven designated sites within Gaza, offering temporary housing units for over 1.5 million individuals, with each unit designed for an average of six occupants. Additionally, initial repairs are planned for 60,000 partially damaged homes, potentially benefiting around 360,000 residents. Reconstruction Phase: This phase is divided into two stages over four and a half years. First Stage (until 2027): With a projected cost of $20 billion, efforts will focus on rebuilding essential infrastructure, including roads, utility networks, and public service facilities. The construction of 200,000 permanent housing units is planned to accommodate approximately 1.6 million people, alongside the reclamation of 20,000 acres of land. Second Stage (until 2030): An estimated $30 billion investment will be directed towards completing infrastructure projects, constructing an additional 200,000 housing units, and developing industrial zones, a fishing port, a commercial seaport, and an airport. Funding Mechanisms To ensure efficient and transparent funding, the proposal suggests the creation of an internationally supervised trust fund. Egypt also plans to host a high-level ministerial conference, bringing together donor countries, international and regional financial institutions, the private sector, and civil society organizations to secure the necessary financial support. Governance and Security Provisions The plan recommends forming a Gaza administration committee composed of independent technocrats and non-partisan figures under the Palestinian government, managing the territory for a transitional period of six months. This approach aims to facilitate the Palestinian Authority's full resumption of control. Egypt and Jordan are reportedly training Palestinian security forces to assume law enforcement responsibilities in Gaza, with calls for international and regional support to fund this initiative. The proposal also considers the potential deployment of international peacekeeping or protection forces in Gaza and the West Bank, as part of a broader strategy leading to the establishment of a Palestinian state. Regional and International Responses President Trump's proposal to depopulate Gaza and transform it into a tourist destination has been met with widespread condemnation from Palestinians, Arab states, and various international partners, who reject any efforts to expel Gazans. In contrast, Egypt's reconstruction plan emphasizes maintaining Gaza's population, aligning with regional sentiments and international law.The post Egypt unveils $53bn Gaza rebuild plan as Arab leaders gather in Cairo first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/egypt-53bn-gaza-rebuild-plan-arab-leaders-cairo/	2025-03-04T08:01:34-08:00	
Israel demands full demilitarization in next phase of Gaza truce	Israel's Foreign Minister, Gideon Saar, announced on Tuesday that the country requires the complete demilitarization of Gaza and the removal of Hamas before advancing to the second phase of the January ceasefire agreement. He emphasized that without these conditions, no progress can be made in the ceasefire process. Saar also expressed concerns that humanitarian aid has become a significant revenue source for Hamas, suggesting that the group utilizes these funds to bolster their militant activities. In response, Hamas leader Sami Abu Zuhri firmly stated that disarmament is a non-negotiable issue for both Hamas and other Palestinian factions, indicating that any discussions involving the resistance's weapons are unacceptable.The post Israel demands full demilitarization in next phase of Gaza truce first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-full-demilitarization-phase-gaza-truce/	2025-03-04T08:01:18-08:00	
With Gaza ceasefire stalled, Israel pushes new plan on Hamas	Israel has introduced a new U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal, referred to as the 'Witkoff proposal,' aiming to pressure Hamas into compliance by imposing a siege on the Gaza Strip. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attributed this plan to U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, though official confirmation from the White House remains pending. This development follows the conclusion of the first phase of a previously negotiated ceasefire, with uncertainty looming over subsequent steps due to the absence of a finalized second phase. The new proposal stipulates that Hamas release half of its remaining hostages in exchange for an extension of the ceasefire and a commitment to negotiate a permanent truce. Notably, this plan does not include provisions for Israel to release additional Palestinian prisoners, a significant element of the initial agreement. Hamas has accused Israel of attempting to undermine the existing agreement, which outlined negotiations for the return of all hostages in exchange for further Palestinian prisoner releases, a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and a lasting ceasefire. However, substantive negotiations on these terms have yet to occur. In response to Hamas's reluctance to accept the new proposal, Israel has halted all supplies, including food, fuel, and medicine, to Gaza's approximately 2 million residents and has warned of additional consequences if Hamas does not comply. Concurrently, Arab leaders are formulating an alternative plan for postwar Gaza, aiming to counter President Trump's controversial suggestion of relocating Gaza's population to transform the area into a tourist destination. The Egyptian proposal envisions Gaza being governed by an interim body controlled by Arab, Muslim, and Western states, effectively sidelining Hamas. This plan is expected to be presented at an upcoming Arab League summit. The original ceasefire agreement, reached in January after extensive negotiations mediated by the United States, Egypt, and Qatar, outlined a three-phase plan to secure the release of hostages taken by Hamas on October 7, 2023, and to end the ensuing conflict. During the initial six-week phase, Hamas released 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight others in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces withdrew from most of Gaza, allowing for an influx of humanitarian aid, despite mutual accusations of violations. citeturn0news33 The second phase presents greater challenges, as it requires Israel to balance its objectives of securing the return of hostages and dismantling Hamas. Hamas has stated it will only release the remaining hostages if Israel ends the war, a move that could leave the militant group with significant influence over Gaza, even if it relinquishes formal power. Under the Witkoff proposal, Hamas would release half of the remaining hostages on the first day, seemingly without receiving any new concessions. This would initiate a six-week period, encompassing the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the Jewish Passover, to negotiate a permanent ceasefire and the return of the remaining hostages. However, with fewer hostages as leverage, Hamas's negotiating position would be weakened, and Israel, along with the United States, is already discussing new conditions, such as the disarmament of Hamas or the exile of its leadership, which were not part of the original agreement. Politically, this plan provides Netanyahu with a six-week reprieve, allowing time to pass a budget by month's end, a necessary step to prevent his government's automatic dissolution. Failure to do so could trigger early elections, potentially jeopardizing his hold on power. Opposition parties have indicated they would support a deal that ensures the return of the remaining hostages, though this could still weaken Netanyahu's political standing. The U.S. stance on the new proposal remains ambiguous. While Netanyahu asserts that his approach is fully coordinated with the Trump administration, which has publicly endorsed Israel's goal of eradicating Hamas, envoy Steve Witkoff has not publicly commented on the plan attributed to him. President Trump has sent mixed signals regarding Gaza, expressing a desire to end Middle East conflicts while also condemning Hamas's treatment of captives and suggesting severe repercussions if they are not released promptly, leaving the final decision to Israel.The post With Gaza ceasefire stalled, Israel pushes new plan on Hamas first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/gaza-ceasefire-stalled-israel-new-plan-hamas/	2025-03-03T11:41:31-08:00	
Israel orders army to defend Druze community near Damascus	Israel's defense ministry has directed the military to prepare for the defense of the Druze community in Jaramana, a suburb of Damascus, in response to reported attacks by Syrian forces. This directive, issued by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz, underscores Israel's commitment to protecting the Druze minority in the region. The situation escalated following clashes in Jaramana, where a confrontation between local gunmen and Syrian security forces resulted in casualties. This unrest has raised concerns about the safety of the Druze population amid Syria's ongoing efforts to reassert control after years of civil conflict. In a related development, prominent Lebanese Druze leader Walid Jumblatt announced plans to visit Syria to meet with the interim leadership. Jumblatt has accused Israel of exacerbating sectarian tensions and has called for the protection of the Druze community. Israel has also demanded the demilitarization of southern Syria, specifically in the provinces of Quneitra, Daraa, and Sweida, to ensure the safety of the Druze population. Israeli forces have established positions in buffer zones and on Mount Hermon to bolster security in these areas.The post Israel orders army to defend Druze community near Damascus first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-army-defend-druze-community-damascus/	2025-03-02T10:59:58-08:00	
Israel halts Gaza aid to pressure Hamas on ceasefire deal	Israel has completely halted the delivery of all goods and humanitarian supplies into Gaza, increasing pressure on Hamas to accept a new proposal aimed at extending the initial phase of a fragile ceasefire. The Israeli government also warned that further consequences would follow if Hamas refuses to engage with the terms presented. Hamas condemned Israel’s move to cut off essential aid, calling it an act of extortion, a violation of international law, and a direct breach of the ceasefire agreement. Despite the escalating rhetoric from both sides, neither officially declared the truce over, leaving the situation in a state of uncertainty. The first phase of the ceasefire agreement, which facilitated increased humanitarian aid into Gaza, officially ended on Saturday. Negotiations over the next phase, which was expected to involve the release of additional hostages in exchange for an Israeli military withdrawal and a more durable ceasefire, have yet to produce an agreement. An Israeli official, speaking anonymously, confirmed that the decision to block aid was coordinated directly with the Trump administration, highlighting the ongoing close collaboration between the two governments. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office announced that Israel supports a proposal put forward by U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff, which calls for extending the initial phase of the ceasefire through both Ramadan and Passover, ending on April 20. According to the proposed plan, Hamas would be required to release half of the remaining hostages on the first day, with the rest to be freed only after both parties reach a final agreement on a permanent ceasefire. Neither the U.S., Egypt, nor Qatar — the main mediators involved in past negotiations — have publicly commented on the latest proposal. During the six-week initial phase of the ceasefire, Hamas released 25 Israeli hostages, along with the bodies of eight others. In return, Israel freed almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli troops largely pulled back from central Gaza, and a temporary increase in aid deliveries helped alleviate some humanitarian needs. However, tensions and accusations persisted throughout the pause, with both sides regularly accusing each other of violating terms. Israeli forces killed dozens of Palestinians during the ceasefire period, claiming they approached restricted zones or ignored security warnings. Hamas, meanwhile, claims the aid suspension directly breaches the ceasefire terms, arguing that the flow of supplies was supposed to continue during talks about the next phase. Israel originally imposed a total blockade on Gaza in the earliest days of the war, only partially easing it later following heavy diplomatic pressure from the Biden administration. Despite that, the United Nations and numerous humanitarian organizations repeatedly criticized Israel for obstructing aid deliveries, arguing that the level of assistance reaching Gaza remained far below what was needed. Israel countered those claims, asserting that adequate supplies were allowed in, while blaming the UN for poor distribution and accusing Hamas of diverting resources. The conflict began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants launched a large-scale assault into southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and taking 251 hostages. As of now, 59 hostages remain in captivity, though 32 are believed to have died. The war’s toll on Gaza has been catastrophic. According to the Gaza Health Ministry, more than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed so far, with over half of the victims reported to be women and children. However, the ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its casualty reports. The extensive Israeli airstrikes and ground operations have reduced large sections of Gaza to rubble. At the peak of the fighting, roughly 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents were displaced. Even now, hundreds of thousands remain crammed into makeshift shelters, including overcrowded schools and tent camps, while most of the population relies entirely on humanitarian aid for food, water, and medical supplies.The post Israel halts Gaza aid to pressure Hamas on ceasefire deal first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-halts-gaza-aid-pressure-hamas-ceasefire-deal/	2025-03-02T10:59:48-08:00	
Flowers, tears and defiance as thousands bury nearly 100 in Leban...	Thousands of mourners gathered in southern Lebanon for an emotional funeral ceremony, honoring nearly 100 Lebanese people who were killed during last year’s war between Israel and Hezbollah. This large-scale funeral, held in the village of Aitaroun, was the biggest mass burial Lebanon has seen since the US-brokered ceasefire came into effect three months earlier. The ceremony followed a separate funeral in Beirut the week before, where tens of thousands came out to pay respects to Hezbollah’s former leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and one of his top aides. The reburial in Aitaroun was arranged to bring home the remains of those killed so they could finally be laid to rest in their hometown. The 95 bodies had originally been buried elsewhere due to the intensity of the conflict and were only recently exhumed for this homecoming. Aitaroun, one of the largest villages in southern Lebanon, was left heavily damaged by the war. Thousands of residents were finally able to return after Israeli forces withdrew from the village in early February. On the day of the reburial, crowds of mourners from Aitaroun and surrounding villages lined the streets, throwing flowers and spraying rose water over the trucks carrying the coffins. Among the mourners were families still searching for the remains of five missing individuals. Of the 95 buried, at least 51 were Hezbollah fighters who had been killed either in Aitaroun or nearby villages. The procession was filled with emotion as relatives carried posters of the deceased, some of whom were as young as 18. The victims also included 16 women, five children, and 10 members of the civil defense who died in the line of duty. Fatima Hejazi, whose 29-year-old brother Ali was among the dead, spoke of her heartbreak while also expressing pride in her brother’s death as part of Hezbollah’s resistance efforts. She, like many others at the funeral, saw those killed as martyrs who gave their lives for the cause. Since Israel intensified its military campaign against Hezbollah in September, the group has reportedly lost hundreds of fighters. However, Hezbollah has not released updated figures on its total losses, though before the escalation they had admitted to losing over 500 fighters during the prior year of lower-level hostilities. During the funeral in Aitaroun, Hezbollah leaders and supporters struck a determined and defiant tone. As the trucks carrying the coffins arrived, organizers called on the crowd to welcome them as heroes. Addressing the mourners, former Hezbollah-allied minister Ibrahim Bayram acknowledged the heavy losses but insisted that the group remains strong. He also urged Lebanon’s government to act with independence rather than under foreign pressure. Among those remembered was a 10-month-old baby girl, who was killed along with 22 others in an Israeli airstrike on October 14, targeting a residential building sheltering displaced families from Aitaroun. At least 32 of the individuals reburied were killed in two particularly deadly Israeli strikes — one on Ain el-Delb in southern Lebanon, and another in Aito, a village in Lebanon’s Christian-majority Zgharta district. These victims, originally from Aitaroun, had been displaced to these areas before being killed. Atef Khouzeirat, who lost his son Hussein in one of the strikes, spoke with anger and sorrow. Hussein, a university graduate who studied radiography, was volunteering with Hezbollah’s Islamic Health Committee at the time. Khouzeirat recounted how his son’s body remained trapped under rubble for 56 days before rescuers were finally able to retrieve it, questioning where the world’s humanity and human rights were in such moments of suffering. The ceremony was attended by official delegations from Iran, Iraq, and Yemen, underscoring the regional significance of the event and Hezbollah’s ties to Tehran and other allies. The wider conflict erupted after Hezbollah launched rockets into Israel on October 8, 2023, a day after Hamas fighters carried out a deadly incursion into southern Israel, which sparked the ongoing war in Gaza. In response, Israel targeted Hezbollah positions with artillery and airstrikes, leading to a steadily intensifying cross-border conflict that escalated into full-scale warfare in September. The toll in Lebanon has been severe, with more than 4,000 killed and over a million people displaced. To date, more than 100,000 Lebanese remain unable to return home due to continued damage and instability. On the Israeli side, dozens of people were killed, and around 60,000 residents of northern Israel were forced to leave their homes to escape the fighting.The post Flowers, tears and defiance as thousands bury nearly 100 in Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/flowers-tears-defiance-thousands-bury-100-lebanon/	2025-03-01T09:47:44-08:00	
Trump approves $3 billion arms deal for Israel	The Trump administration has authorized a substantial arms sale to Israel, totaling nearly $3 billion, by invoking an emergency provision to bypass the standard congressional review process. This decision facilitates the immediate transfer of munitions that have been utilized in Israel's recent military operations against Hamas in Gaza. The approved package includes over 35,500 MK 84 and BLU-117 bombs, along with 4,000 Predator warheads, collectively valued at $2.04 billion. Deliveries for these munitions are scheduled to commence next year. Additionally, the State Department has sanctioned another munitions sale to Israel worth $675.7 million, with deliveries set to begin in 2028. The emergency provision was invoked by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, citing national security interests, thereby waiving the usual congressional review requirements. Furthermore, the administration has approved the sale of D9R and D9T Caterpillar bulldozers to Israel, valued at $295 million. This arms sale occurs in the context of ongoing conflicts in the region, where Israel has been engaged in military actions against Hamas in Gaza. The utilization of MK 84 bombs, which are 2,000-pound general-purpose munitions, has been documented in these operations. The expedited approval of this arms deal underscores the administration's commitment to supporting Israel's defense capabilities amid escalating tensions in the Middle East. The decision to bypass the standard congressional review process has elicited varied reactions. Proponents argue that the urgency of the situation necessitates swift action to ensure Israel's security. Critics, however, express concerns about the lack of legislative oversight and the potential implications for regional stability. The administration maintains that the arms sale is in the national security interests of the United States and is essential for supporting an ally in a volatile region. This development adds to a series of recent arms deals between the United States and Israel, reflecting a continued strategic partnership. The transfer of advanced munitions and equipment is intended to bolster Israel's military readiness and deterrence capabilities in the face of ongoing threats. As deliveries commence in the coming years, the impact of these arms transfers on the regional security landscape will be closely monitored by international observers.The post Trump approves $3 billion arms deal for Israel first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/trump-approves-3-billion-arms-deal-israel/	2025-03-01T09:47:38-08:00	
Israel opens fire as 95 killed in war laid to rest in Aitaroun	In the southern Lebanese town of Aitaroun, families gathered on Friday to mourn 95 individuals, including civilians and Hezbollah fighters, who perished during a 14-month conflict with Israel. These victims had been temporarily interred in Tyre due to the Israeli military's extended presence in border areas beyond the initial withdrawal deadline. The Lebanese Health Ministry and military had designated a plot in Tyre for these provisional burials until conditions allowed for reburial in their hometowns. The return of the coffins, draped in Lebanese and Hezbollah flags, was met with traditional gestures of rice and flowers from residents as they made their way to Aitaroun for official burial ceremonies. However, during the funeral, Israeli forces reportedly fired upon the southern outskirts of the village, highlighting the persistent volatility in the region. Concurrently, Lebanon's newly appointed Prime Minister, Nawaf Salam, toured several war-torn border areas, advocating for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Lebanese territory. He assured residents of border villages of their safe return and committed to the reconstruction of destroyed homes. Salam emphasized the necessity of Arab and international support to ensure Israel's full withdrawal, stating that lasting stability is unattainable without it. The conflict, which ignited on October 8, 2023, following Hezbollah's rocket attacks into northern Israel—a day after a deadly Hamas-led incursion into southern Israel—resulted in over 4,000 Lebanese fatalities and displaced more than a million people at its peak. Despite a ceasefire agreement in late November, Israeli troops have maintained positions on five strategic hills within southern Lebanon. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz announced that Israel, with U.S. approval, would indefinitely retain control over these areas to prevent Hezbollah's return south of the Litani River. The Lebanese government has rejected proposals for joint U.S.-French control over these strategic points, insisting that the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), in coordination with the Lebanese army, assume control. The occupied hills, including locations such as Jabal Blat and Labouneh, are considered strategic due to their vantage points and proximity to northern Israeli towns.The post Israel opens fire as 95 killed in war laid to rest in Aitaroun first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-opens-fire-95-killed-war-laid-aitaroun/	2025-02-28T11:19:16-08:00	
Man caught with $2.5 million arrested at Beirut Airport	On Friday morning, authorities at Beirut's Rafic Hariri International Airport apprehended a man identified as Mohammad H. upon his arrival on a Turkish Pegasus Airlines flight. During a routine inspection, officials discovered $2.5 million in cash concealed within his luggage. This significant seizure has prompted an intensive investigation to determine the origin of the funds and their intended destination. Preliminary reports suggest that the confiscated money was earmarked for Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group. This incident aligns with longstanding allegations from Israel, which asserts that Iranian operatives and Turkish nationals have been covertly funneling money from Tehran and Istanbul into Beirut to bolster Hezbollah's activities. In response to these concerns, Lebanese authorities have taken decisive action by indefinitely suspending all flights to and from Iran. This measure follows warnings from the United States, a key mediator in the November 27 ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel, indicating that Israel might target aircraft suspected of transporting illicit funds or weapons to Hezbollah. The Lebanese Directorate General of Civil Aviation has stated that this suspension is a precautionary step to ensure the safety of air travel and to prevent potential escalations. The flight ban has ignited significant unrest among Hezbollah supporters. Protesters have obstructed the main access road to Beirut's sole international airport, leading to clashes with security forces. Hezbollah's deputy leader, Sheikh Naim Qassem, has publicly condemned the government's decision, accusing it of capitulating to Israeli demands and undermining Lebanon's sovereignty.The post Man caught with $2.5 million arrested at Beirut Airport first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/man-caught-2-5-million-arrested-beirut-airport/	2025-02-28T11:19:08-08:00	
Israel considered striking Nasrallah’s funeral, says Halevi	Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) Chief Herzi Halevi recently suggested that the military considered targeting the funeral of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Addressing cadets at the 1st Infantry Division, Halevi mentioned deliberations about the event, implying a potential attack was under discussion. During Nasrallah's funeral in Beirut, Israeli warplanes conducted low-altitude flyovers, causing a significant disturbance among the tens of thousands of mourners gathered at the Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium. This act was intended as a show of force, with Defense Minister Israel Katz stating that the flyover served as a clear message to those threatening Israel. Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike in September, which also claimed the lives of several Hezbollah officials and a senior Iranian general. His successor, Hashem Safieddine, met a similar fate shortly after assuming leadership. The recent funeral underscored the ongoing tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, with both sides exchanging threats and demonstrating military capabilities.The post Israel considered striking Nasrallah’s funeral, says Halevi first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-considered-striking-nasrallahs-funeral-halevi/	2025-02-27T11:10:12-08:00	
Hamas says it’s ready to negotiate next phase of Gaza ceasefire	Hamas has expressed its readiness to enter discussions for the next phase of the Gaza ceasefire, following a significant prisoner exchange. In this recent exchange, Hamas handed over the remains of four Israeli hostages in return for the release of over 600 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli custody. This marks the completion of the initial phase of the truce, which commenced on January 19, 2025. The hostages returned to Israel were noted to have been killed either during their captivity or in the course of Hamas's initial attack on October 7, 2023, which ignited the ongoing conflict. The current ceasefire aims to bring an end to the war that has severely impacted Gaza. Public pressure within Israel is mounting to extend the ceasefire to facilitate the release of the remaining 59 hostages, though it is believed that fewer than half are still alive. The successful conclusion of the first phase, mediated by Egypt, saw the liberation of 620 Palestinians, including individuals previously sentenced to life for attacks on Israelis. Hamas has emphasized its commitment to the agreement and indicated that further negotiations are contingent upon Israel's adherence to the terms. In a related development, an Israeli official has stated that the military will maintain its presence in the Philadelphi Corridor along the Gaza-Egypt border, despite stipulations in the ceasefire agreement calling for withdrawal. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, cited the necessity of preventing weapons smuggling as the rationale for retaining control over this strategic area. This stance could potentially lead to tensions with Hamas and Egypt, the latter having played a pivotal role in mediating the ceasefire and advocating for Israel's withdrawal from the corridor. The initial phase of the ceasefire is set to conclude this weekend, with subsequent negotiations yet to commence. The war, which erupted in October 2023 following a Hamas attack on Israel, has resulted in substantial casualties and widespread destruction in Gaza. The ceasefire agreement, brokered by Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin al-Thani, includes a 42-day truce, followed by phased negotiations aimed at the release of remaining hostages and the establishment of a permanent ceasefire. Further discussions are scheduled to take place in Cairo to address the implementation of the agreement. Both U.S. President Joe Biden and newly re-elected President Donald Trump have expressed support for the deal.The post Hamas says it’s ready to negotiate next phase of Gaza ceasefire first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hamas-ready-negotiate-next-phase-gaza-ceasefire/	2025-02-27T11:10:04-08:00	
Witkoff: Lebanon and Syria could join Abraham Accords	U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, has expressed optimism about the potential inclusion of Saudi Arabia in the Abraham Accords, a series of normalization agreements between Israel and Arab nations brokered during Trump's first term. Witkoff believes that such a development could pave the way for broader regional peace, suggesting that countries like Lebanon and Syria might also consider normalizing relations with Israel following recent setbacks faced by Iran-backed forces in those nations. In a recent interview, Witkoff emphasized the transformative impact of normalization, stating that it represents 'the beginning of the end of war' in the region. He highlighted that a ceasefire in Gaza is a crucial precondition for expanding the Abraham Accords, as stability would make the region more attractive for investment and reduce the threat of attacks from groups like Hezbollah and Hamas. Witkoff's diplomatic efforts have included meetings with key regional leaders. He recently traveled to Saudi Arabia to discuss potential normalization agreements with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Following this, he visited Israel to engage with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, focusing on advancing the next phase of the ceasefire with Hamas and exploring opportunities to broaden the scope of the Abraham Accords.The post Witkoff: Lebanon and Syria could join Abraham Accords first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/witkoff-lebanon-syria-could-join-abraham-accords/	2025-02-26T09:43:48-08:00	
Israeli general says security stable for northerners to return	Major General Uri Gordin, head of Israel's Northern Command, has informed local leaders near the Lebanese border that the current security conditions permit evacuated residents to return to their communities. He also announced plans to reopen tourist sites in northern Israel by early March. Approximately 60,000 Israelis were evacuated from border areas during the 14-month conflict with Hezbollah. Although a fragile ceasefire has been in place, both sides have reported violations. Israel continues to maintain forces on five strategic Lebanese hills overlooking both southern Lebanon and northern Israel. Despite the evacuation orders being lifted, most displaced residents have yet to return home. The conflict, which began on October 8, 2023, following Hezbollah's rocket attacks a day after a deadly Hamas assault on Israel, led to the evacuation of numerous border settlements. The war resulted in significant casualties and displacement on both sides. In Lebanon, over 1 million people were displaced, with reconstruction efforts expected to take years, especially in southern towns that suffered extensive damage. Hezbollah's rocket attacks claimed the lives of 77 individuals in Israel, more than half of whom were civilians. Israeli air and ground operations led to over 4,000 deaths in Lebanon, predominantly among civilians. The Israeli government has prioritized the return of displaced residents and is offering incentives to encourage them to return to their homes. However, the repatriation process has been slow, partly due to residents' concerns about safety and the substantial rehabilitation needed in affected communities. The prolonged conflict has also had a profound economic impact. A recent survey indicates that one-fifth of Israelis who evacuated their homes have lost their jobs. The displaced population, primarily from areas near Gaza and the Lebanese border, faced extended stays in temporary accommodations, leading to job losses and reduced household incomes. The Israeli economy experienced minimal growth in 2024, partly due to increased defense spending and labor shortages in critical sectors.The post Israeli general says security stable for northerners to return first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-general-security-stable-northerners-return/	2025-02-26T09:43:40-08:00	
How many hostages remain in Gaza?	On Saturday, Hamas released six Israeli hostages, marking the final scheduled release of living captives under the current phase of a ceasefire agreement with Israel. This phase has seen the liberation of 33 Israelis, including eight deceased individuals, and five Thai nationals. Despite these releases, 63 hostages, among them the remains of a soldier held since 2014, remain in Gaza. The transfer of four Israeli hostages' remains was marred by an incident where Hamas handed over the incorrect body for Shiri Bibas, an Israeli mother abducted alongside her two young sons. After a tense standoff, her correct remains were returned and identified early Saturday. The final four sets of remains are expected to be returned in the coming days. The initial abduction of 251 individuals by Hamas-led militants occurred during the October 7, 2023, attack, which ignited the ongoing conflict. The ensuing war has resulted in over 48,000 Palestinian deaths in Gaza, predominantly women and children, as reported by Gaza's Health Ministry. It's important to note that these figures do not differentiate between civilians and combatants. In exchange for the hostages, Israel is releasing nearly 2,000 prisoners and detainees during this first phase of the ceasefire. As of now, 141 hostages have been released through exchanges or other agreements, including four deceased individuals. Sixty-two hostages remain in captivity, with Israel declaring 35 of them deceased. Among the captives are 13 soldiers, seven of whom have been declared dead by Israeli authorities. Additionally, Israeli troops have retrieved the bodies of 40 hostages and rescued eight alive. Non-Israeli captives still held include five individuals—three Thai nationals, one Nepalese, and one Tanzanian—of whom two are believed to be alive. Separately, two hostages held prior to October 7, 2023, have been released. Israel has also recovered the body of a soldier held in Gaza since his death in the 2014 Israel-Hamas war, while the remains of a second soldier killed in 2014 remain in Gaza. The ceasefire agreement remains fragile, with recent delays in the release of 620 Palestinian prisoners by Israel, seeking assurances about the dignified return of its hostages. This postponement has caused distress among families awaiting reunification and poses a risk to the stability of the ceasefire. In Gaza, the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate, with at least six infants succumbing to hypothermia due to inadequate shelter amid cold weather conditions. The ongoing conflict has led to massive casualties and destruction, overshadowing moments of hope for families anticipating the return of their loved ones.The post How many hostages remain in Gaza? first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/how-many-hostages-remain-gaza/	2025-02-25T07:15:33-08:00	
Iran on ‘high alert’ over feared attack on nuclear sites	Iran has heightened the alert status of its defense systems surrounding nuclear facilities due to concerns over potential attacks from Israel and the United States. This move includes the deployment of additional air defense launchers to bolster security. Earlier this month, Iran unveiled the 'Etemad' ballistic missile, which boasts a range of 1,700 kilometers. This missile, measuring 16 meters in length and 1.25 meters in diameter, is equipped with a precision-guided warhead designed to maintain accuracy throughout its flight. The unveiling ceremony in Tehran was attended by President Masoud Pezeshkian, who emphasized that the advancement of defense capabilities aims to deter any aggression against Iranian territory. U.S. intelligence agencies have recently indicated that Israel may be planning a preemptive strike on Iran's nuclear infrastructure by midyear. This assessment follows an incident in October when Israel conducted airstrikes in Iran in response to a missile attack. In light of these developments, Iran has intensified its defensive posture to safeguard its strategic assets. In April, Iran launched a significant missile and drone assault on Israel after the deaths of two Iranian generals in an alleged Israeli airstrike in Syria. While the attack resulted in minimal damage, it marked a notable escalation in regional tensions. Israel, under international pressure to exercise restraint, conducted a limited retaliatory strike. On October 1, Iran fired approximately 180 missiles into Israel, prompting civilians to seek shelter. The assault caused minor damage and a few injuries. Israel responded with airstrikes targeting missile production facilities and air defense sites, aiming to diminish Iran's offensive capabilities.The post Iran on ‘high alert’ over feared attack on nuclear sites first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/iran-high-alert-feared-attack-nuclear-sites/	2025-02-25T07:15:25-08:00	
Israeli warplanes roar low over Beirut during Nasrallah funeral	During the funeral of Hezbollah's former leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in Beirut, Israeli warplanes conducted low-altitude flights over the city, causing sonic booms that resonated throughout the capital. This display coincided with the mass gathering of tens of thousands of mourners at the Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz stated that these flights were intended to send a 'clear message' to those threatening Israel, emphasizing that adversaries would meet a similar fate. Nasrallah, who led Hezbollah for over three decades, was killed in an Israeli airstrike nearly five months prior. His death, along with that of his cousin and designated successor, Hashem Safieddine, marked significant losses for the Iran-backed group. Despite these setbacks, Hezbollah's current leader, Naim Qassem, addressed the crowd, reaffirming the organization's resilience and commitment to resistance against Israel. The funeral drew international attendees, including delegations from Iran, Iraq, and Yemen, underscoring Hezbollah's extensive regional influence. The Israeli flyovers during the ceremony further heightened tensions, with Defense Minister Katz reiterating Israel's stance against any threats to its security.The post Israeli warplanes roar low over Beirut during Nasrallah funeral first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-warplanes-beirut-nasrallah-funeral/	2025-02-23T07:13:30-08:00	
Israel says it struck Hezbollah arms smuggling routes on Lebanon-...	On Saturday, Israeli forces conducted airstrikes along the Lebanon-Syria border, targeting routes allegedly used by Hezbollah for smuggling weapons into Lebanon. The Israeli military stated that these operations aimed to disrupt Hezbollah's efforts to rebuild its arsenal, considering such smuggling attempts a clear violation of existing ceasefire agreements between Israel and Lebanon. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the strikes focused on smuggling routes, including unauthorized crossings along the border. No immediate reports of casualties have emerged from these operations. This military action occurred just one day before the scheduled mass funeral for Hassan Nasrallah, the long-serving leader of Hezbollah, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike nearly five months prior. Nasrallah's death marked a significant setback for the Iran-backed organization, which has faced considerable challenges following last year's conflict and the loss of its ally, Bashar al-Assad, in Syria. The funeral, planned to take place at Beirut's Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium, is expected to draw hundreds of thousands of supporters, including international dignitaries and allies from the region. The event aims to showcase Hezbollah's enduring influence and resilience despite recent adversities. In the lead-up to the funeral, Lebanese state media reported Israeli aircraft flying at low altitudes over Beirut and its suburbs, coinciding with the large gatherings of mourners. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz stated that these flights served as a 'clear message' to those threatening Israel, emphasizing the potential consequences of hostile actions against the nation.The post Israel says it struck Hezbollah arms smuggling routes on Lebanon-Syria border first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-struck-hezbollah-arms-smuggling-lebanon-syria-border/	2025-02-23T07:13:23-08:00	
Thousands arrive in Beirut for Nasrallah’s funeral	Thousands of supporters have converged on Beirut to attend the funeral of Hezbollah's long-standing leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike on September 27, 2024. The funeral is scheduled for February 23, 2025, at Beirut's main sports stadium. Nasrallah, a pivotal figure in Hezbollah for over three decades, was instrumental in shaping the group into a formidable force in the Middle East. His death, resulting from an Israeli airstrike targeting Hezbollah's headquarters in Beirut's southern suburbs, has been a significant blow to the organization. In the days leading up to the funeral, flights from Iraq have been fully booked, with up to 6,000 individuals traveling to Beirut to pay their respects. Notably, American commentator Jackson Hinkle expressed his honor in attending the funeral, highlighting Nasrallah's influence beyond the Middle East. However, Lebanese authorities revoked permission for a passenger plane from Iran, leaving several mourners stranded in Tehran and prompting protests by Hezbollah supporters in Lebanon. The assassination of Nasrallah has escalated tensions in the region, with Lebanese citizens expressing shock and fear of potential all-out war. The airstrike not only claimed Nasrallah's life but also caused significant destruction in Beirut, leading to mass displacement and a heightened sense of vulnerability among residents. In response to the assassination, Yemeni Information Minister Moammar al-Eryani called for the arrest of Houthi officials attending Nasrallah's funeral, urging the Lebanese government to hand them over to Yemen's internationally recognized authorities.The post Thousands arrive in Beirut for Nasrallah’s funeral first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/thousands-arrive-beirut-nasrallahs-funeral/	2025-02-22T06:53:31-08:00	
Lebanese-American convicted of attempting to kill Rushdie	Hadi Matar, a 27-year-old from New Jersey, has been convicted of attempted murder and assault for the 2022 stabbing of author Salman Rushdie during a literary event in New York. The jury deliberated for less than two hours before delivering the verdict. Matar faces up to 25 years in prison, with sentencing scheduled for April. The attack occurred in August 2022 at the Chautauqua Institution, where Rushdie was about to speak. Matar rushed the stage and stabbed Rushdie approximately 15 times, resulting in severe injuries, including the loss of sight in his right eye, liver damage, and paralysis of his right hand. Rushdie was hospitalized for 17 days following the assault. During the trial, Rushdie provided detailed testimony about the attack and its aftermath, describing the intense pain and his belief that he was dying. Matar, who pleaded not guilty and rejected a plea deal, expressed no remorse and faces additional federal terrorism-related charges for allegedly supporting Hezbollah. The motivation for the attack is believed to be linked to a 1989 fatwa issued by Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, calling for Rushdie's death over his novel 'The Satanic Verses,' which was deemed blasphemous by some in the Muslim community. Despite assurances from Iran in 1998 that they no longer supported the fatwa, threats against Rushdie persisted.The post Lebanese-American convicted of attempting to kill Rushdie first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lebanese-american-convicted-attempting-kill-rushdie/	2025-02-22T06:53:24-08:00	
Israel strikes Hezbollah border crossings between Lebanon and Syr...	Israel has announced that its air force targeted crossing points along the Lebanon-Syria border utilized by Hezbollah for smuggling weapons into Lebanon. The Israeli military emphasized that these smuggling activities violate the existing ceasefire agreements between Israel and Lebanon. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the overnight airstrikes rendered an 'illegal crossing' near Lebanon's Wadi Khaled, adjacent to Syria's Homs province, inoperative and resulted in several injuries. The strikes occurred after a convoy of smuggler vehicles was detected moving from Syria toward Lebanon. Lebanon's National News Agency noted that Israeli aircraft were observed flying at low altitudes over Hermel city and surrounding areas in the Bekaa Valley near the Syrian border. This development follows a fragile ceasefire established on November 27, after over a year of hostilities, including two months of intense conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. Both parties have accused each other of breaching the ceasefire terms. Under the ceasefire agreement, the Lebanese military was to deploy in southern Lebanon alongside U.N. peacekeepers as Israeli forces withdrew over a 60-day period, later extended to February 18. Hezbollah was expected to retreat north of the Litani River, approximately 30 kilometers from the border, and dismantle its military infrastructure in the south. However, just before the latest deadline, Israel announced it would maintain troops in five 'strategic points' near the border. Earlier this month, the Israeli military reported conducting an airstrike on a tunnel along the Syria-Lebanon border used by Hezbollah for weapon smuggling. In January, Israeli airstrikes targeted areas in eastern and southern Lebanon, with the Israeli military stating that the operations were against Hezbollah targets, including smuggling routes along the Syrian border. The Lebanon-Syria border spans approximately 330 kilometers without official demarcation. Hezbollah, which has significant influence in regions along this border, has been actively involved in the Syrian conflict, supporting President Bashar al-Assad's forces.The post Israel strikes Hezbollah border crossings between Lebanon and Syria first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-strikes-hezbollah-border-crossings-lebanon-syria/	2025-02-21T03:38:55-08:00	
Arab leaders meet in Saudi Arabia to shape Gaza plan	Arab leaders convened in Saudi Arabia on Friday to formulate a comprehensive recovery plan for Gaza, aiming to counter President Donald Trump's controversial proposal for U.S. control over the territory and the displacement of its inhabitants. Trump's plan has unified Arab nations in opposition, yet debates persist regarding Gaza's future governance and the financing of its reconstruction. The Saudi Press Agency reported that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman extended invitations to leaders from Gulf Arab countries, Egypt, and Jordan for an informal meeting in Riyadh. This gathering seeks to strengthen fraternal relations and prepare for an emergency Arab League summit scheduled in Egypt on March 4. The primary focus is to develop a reconstruction strategy for Gaza that offers a viable alternative to Trump's proposal, which has been widely criticized for its potential to destabilize the region. Egypt is anticipated to present a detailed reconstruction plan during the Riyadh discussions. This plan is expected to outline a phased approach to rebuilding Gaza's infrastructure and economy, emphasizing the importance of Palestinian self-governance and regional cooperation. However, significant challenges remain, particularly concerning the mobilization of financial resources and the establishment of a stable governance framework in the post-war period. The urgency of these discussions is heightened by the extensive devastation in Gaza following prolonged conflict. The United Nations estimates that reconstruction efforts will require substantial investment, with figures potentially reaching into the tens of billions of dollars. The international community, alongside regional stakeholders, faces the critical task of ensuring that reconstruction efforts are inclusive, sustainable, and respectful of the rights and aspirations of the Palestinian people.The post Arab leaders meet in Saudi Arabia to shape Gaza plan first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/arab-leaders-meet-saudi-arabia-shape-gaza-plan/	2025-02-21T03:38:47-08:00
