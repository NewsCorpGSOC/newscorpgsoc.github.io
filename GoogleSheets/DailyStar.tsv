Israel strikes Hezbollah border crossings between Lebanon and Syr...	Israel has announced that its air force targeted crossing points along the Lebanon-Syria border utilized by Hezbollah for smuggling weapons into Lebanon. The Israeli military emphasized that these smuggling activities violate the existing ceasefire agreements between Israel and Lebanon. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the overnight airstrikes rendered an 'illegal crossing' near Lebanon's Wadi Khaled, adjacent to Syria's Homs province, inoperative and resulted in several injuries. The strikes occurred after a convoy of smuggler vehicles was detected moving from Syria toward Lebanon. Lebanon's National News Agency noted that Israeli aircraft were observed flying at low altitudes over Hermel city and surrounding areas in the Bekaa Valley near the Syrian border. This development follows a fragile ceasefire established on November 27, after over a year of hostilities, including two months of intense conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. Both parties have accused each other of breaching the ceasefire terms. Under the ceasefire agreement, the Lebanese military was to deploy in southern Lebanon alongside U.N. peacekeepers as Israeli forces withdrew over a 60-day period, later extended to February 18. Hezbollah was expected to retreat north of the Litani River, approximately 30 kilometers from the border, and dismantle its military infrastructure in the south. However, just before the latest deadline, Israel announced it would maintain troops in five 'strategic points' near the border. Earlier this month, the Israeli military reported conducting an airstrike on a tunnel along the Syria-Lebanon border used by Hezbollah for weapon smuggling. In January, Israeli airstrikes targeted areas in eastern and southern Lebanon, with the Israeli military stating that the operations were against Hezbollah targets, including smuggling routes along the Syrian border. The Lebanon-Syria border spans approximately 330 kilometers without official demarcation. Hezbollah, which has significant influence in regions along this border, has been actively involved in the Syrian conflict, supporting President Bashar al-Assad's forces.The post Israel strikes Hezbollah border crossings between Lebanon and Syria first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-strikes-hezbollah-border-crossings-lebanon-syria/	2025-02-21T03:38:55-08:00	
Arab leaders meet in Saudi Arabia to shape Gaza plan	Arab leaders convened in Saudi Arabia on Friday to formulate a comprehensive recovery plan for Gaza, aiming to counter President Donald Trump's controversial proposal for U.S. control over the territory and the displacement of its inhabitants. Trump's plan has unified Arab nations in opposition, yet debates persist regarding Gaza's future governance and the financing of its reconstruction. The Saudi Press Agency reported that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman extended invitations to leaders from Gulf Arab countries, Egypt, and Jordan for an informal meeting in Riyadh. This gathering seeks to strengthen fraternal relations and prepare for an emergency Arab League summit scheduled in Egypt on March 4. The primary focus is to develop a reconstruction strategy for Gaza that offers a viable alternative to Trump's proposal, which has been widely criticized for its potential to destabilize the region. Egypt is anticipated to present a detailed reconstruction plan during the Riyadh discussions. This plan is expected to outline a phased approach to rebuilding Gaza's infrastructure and economy, emphasizing the importance of Palestinian self-governance and regional cooperation. However, significant challenges remain, particularly concerning the mobilization of financial resources and the establishment of a stable governance framework in the post-war period. The urgency of these discussions is heightened by the extensive devastation in Gaza following prolonged conflict. The United Nations estimates that reconstruction efforts will require substantial investment, with figures potentially reaching into the tens of billions of dollars. The international community, alongside regional stakeholders, faces the critical task of ensuring that reconstruction efforts are inclusive, sustainable, and respectful of the rights and aspirations of the Palestinian people.The post Arab leaders meet in Saudi Arabia to shape Gaza plan first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/arab-leaders-meet-saudi-arabia-shape-gaza-plan/	2025-02-21T03:38:47-08:00	
Hamas returns bodies of four Israeli hostages, including mother a...	On February 20, 2025, Hamas returned the bodies of four Israeli hostages, including mother Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir, who were abducted during the October 7, 2023, attack. The remains were handed over in a somber ceremony in Khan Younis, Gaza, where Hamas displayed the coffins before transferring them to the Red Cross for delivery to Israeli authorities. The fourth body was that of 85-year-old Oded Lifshitz, a peace activist from Nir Oz kibbutz. The Bibas family had been taken from their home in Nir Oz during the October attack. Shiri's husband, Yarden, was also abducted but was released earlier this month. The return of their bodies has been a deeply painful moment for Israel, with President Isaac Herzog expressing profound sorrow and seeking forgiveness for not being able to protect them. This handover is part of a fragile ceasefire agreement that has seen the release of several hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. However, the situation remains tense, with ongoing negotiations and uncertainty about the future of the ceasefire. The conflict has resulted in significant loss of life and widespread devastation in Gaza.The post Hamas returns bodies of four Israeli hostages, including mother and two children first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hamas-returns-bodies-israeli-hostages-mother-children/	2025-02-20T09:05:59-08:00	
Arab leaders unite to challenge Trump’s Gaza plan	Reacting to the proposal by US President Donald Trump to consider putting the Gaza Strip under America's control, expelling its residents, Arab leaders are meeting in Saudi Arabia to devise an alternative plan. The Arab leaders summit will take place tomorrow in Riyadh with leaders from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, Egypt, Jordan, and the Palestinian Authority. Their aim is to work on a rebuilding plan for Gaza which shall retain the population but is to exclude Hamas from being part of the running government. Trump's plan, announced earlier this month, suggests relocating approximately 2 million Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring countries and redeveloping the area into a 'Riviera of the Middle East.' This proposal has been met with widespread condemnation from Arab nations and human rights organizations, who describe it as 'ethnic cleansing.' Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Jordan's King Abdullah II have both rejected the idea of resettling Palestinians within their borders. The alternative plan, primarily developed by Egypt, outlines a three-phase reconstruction process over three to five years. The initial phase focuses on immediate recovery, including debris removal and establishing temporary safe zones within Gaza. The subsequent phase involves an international conference to secure funding and rebuild essential infrastructure. The final phase aims to construct permanent housing and restore educational and healthcare services. A significant aspect of this plan is the exclusion of Hamas from any governing role in the post-reconstruction administration of Gaza. Financing is still the most acute challenge facing the Arab-led initiative. While nations like Kuwait might donate for humanitarian purposes, others like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates will be required to attach certain conditions to financial contributions. The next summit aims to resolve these financial issues and entrench a common Arab position against the U.S. proposal.The post Arab leaders unite to challenge Trump’s Gaza plan first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/arab-leaders-unite-challenge-trumps-gaza-plan/	2025-02-20T09:05:53-08:00	
Israeli officials split on Lebanon pullout as one vows more strik...	In the early hours of Monday, an Israeli airstrike targeted a vehicle in Sidon, southern Lebanon, resulting in the death of Mohammad Shahine, a Hamas military commander. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) stated that Shahine was responsible for orchestrating attacks against Israeli civilians, allegedly with Iranian support. This incident marks a significant escalation, as it's the deepest Israeli strike into Lebanon since the ceasefire began in late November. The airstrike occurred near a Lebanese army checkpoint and Sidon's municipal sports stadium. Footage from the scene showed a vehicle engulfed in flames, with emergency responders recovering a charred body. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported that an 'enemy drone' carried out the attack, which also injured two civilians. This development comes just before the February 18 deadline for Israeli forces to withdraw from southern Lebanon, as stipulated in the ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah. However, Israeli officials have indicated plans to maintain a presence at five strategic locations beyond this deadline, citing concerns over Hezbollah's continued activities and the Lebanese Army's delayed deployment in the region. Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer emphasized that the IDF would remain in these positions until Lebanon fulfills its obligations under the ceasefire agreement. Lebanese leaders, including President Joseph Aoun and parliamentary speaker Nabih Berri, have rejected Israel's intention to retain these positions, insisting on a complete withdrawal as per the agreement. Hezbollah's leader, Naim Qassem, warned that any Israeli presence beyond the deadline would be considered an occupation, urging the Lebanese government to enforce the terms of the ceasefire. The situation remains tense, with both sides accusing each other of violating the ceasefire. The international community is closely monitoring the developments, as the potential for renewed hostilities looms if the terms of the ceasefire are not fully implemented by all parties involved.The post Israeli officials split on Lebanon pullout as one vows more strikes first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-split-lebanon-pullout-one-vows-strikes/	2025-02-17T06:02:24-08:00	
Israeli drone strike targets Hamas commander in Sidon	An airstrike carried out by Israel on Monday hit a vehicle in the southern Lebanese city of Sidon, resulting in the death of one individual. The attack came just one day before the deadline for an Israeli troop withdrawal under a fragile ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah. According to a Lebanese security source, the person killed was a military unit commander affiliated with Hamas. Israeli forces later claimed responsibility for the strike, stating that Mohammad Shahine, identified as a Hamas commander, had been involved in orchestrating attacks against Israel, including launching rockets. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly interrupted his ongoing trial to approve the operation, according to Israeli media reports. The strike in Sidon marks the deepest Israeli attack inside Lebanon since the ceasefire was established in late November. Video footage circulating online captured the aftermath, showing a vehicle engulfed in flames. The attack took place near a Lebanese army checkpoint and Sidon’s municipal sports stadium. Under the ceasefire terms, Israeli troops were originally set to pull out from southern Lebanon by the end of January. However, at Israel’s request, Lebanon agreed to extend the deadline to February 18. Whether the withdrawal will be completed by Tuesday remains uncertain. Despite the ceasefire, Israel has continued airstrikes in southern and eastern Lebanon, stating that its targets are military sites containing weaponry and operational facilities.The post Israeli drone strike targets Hamas commander in Sidon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-drone-strike-hamas-commander-sidon/	2025-02-17T06:02:15-08:00	
Breaking: Lebanon blocked Iranian planes after US warnings	In retaliation for Israeli threats, Lebanon twice this week denied Iranian flights permission to land at Beirut. Lebanese officials informed Iran on Thursday that a flight already scheduled was not to depart. The action followed an Israeli threat, relayed through the United States, to bring down the plane if it tried to land in Lebanon. After consultation between the prime minister and president, the transport and public works ministry withheld permission for the flight before takeoff. This withholding was also performed on Friday, leading to Hezbollah supporters' protests that resulted in the closure of Beirut's international airport road. Prime Minister Nawaf Salam emphasized that the safety of travelers and security of the airport are a priority. Israel charged that Hezbollah had smuggled arms from Iran into Lebanon via Beirut airport, a claim both Hezbollah and Lebanese officials refuted. Since November 27, there has been a precarious ceasefire, following months of Israeli-Hezbollah hostilities.The post Breaking: Lebanon blocked Iranian planes after US warnings first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lebanon-blocked-iranian-planes-us-warnings/	2025-02-16T04:21:48-08:00	
Israel receives shipment of heavy US bombs	A shipment of United States-made bombs overnighted into Israel has arrived, Israel's defense ministry reported, as Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited the country for the first time. The shipment, consisting of MK-84 heavy aerial bombs, had only been cleared by President Donald Trump's administration. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz has termed the shipment a strategic asset for the Israeli Air Force and the entire military, affirming the United States' and Israel's strong alliance. The Trump administration previously greenlighted a package of military equipment valued at over $7.4 billion, including missiles and bombs and other military equipment, to enhance Israel's defense system and counter regional threats. The delivery follows weeks of intense clashes between Israel and Hamas after Hamas' massive October 2023 attack. The war severely damaged Gaza, leaving much of its 2.4 million people displaced. Since January 19, there has been a ceasefire deal that facilitated the release of hostages captured by Hamas. The Biden administration had previously withheld a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel due to civilian casualties in Gaza. Trump later, though, overturned this decision after assuming office and cleared the release of the weapons. Rubio during his visit will most probably have a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials. Talks during his meetings are bound to touch on the Gaza ceasefire and the controversial plan put forward by Trump of relocating Palestinians out of Gaza and settling them in Egypt and Jordan, which had severe international backlash.The post Israel receives shipment of heavy US bombs first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-receives-shipment-heavy-us-bombs/	2025-02-16T04:21:41-08:00	
Lebanon calls emergency security meeting after UNIFIL protest att...	Lebanese officials are convening an emergency session following an assault on a United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) convoy near Beirut's airport, which resulted in injuries to the outgoing deputy force commander, Major General Chok Bahadur Dhakal. The incident occurred amid protests by Hezbollah supporters against the Lebanese government's decision to deny landing rights to two Iranian aircraft, a move perceived as succumbing to Israeli allegations of Iran funneling funds to Hezbollah via civilian flights. UNIFIL reported that during the Friday night attack, one of its vehicles was set ablaze, leading to Major General Dhakal's injuries as he was en route home after completing his mission. The peacekeeping force has called for a thorough and swift investigation by Lebanese authorities to ensure those responsible are held accountable. The Lebanese Army has committed to taking decisive measures against the perpetrators and has announced an emergency meeting of the Central Internal Security Council to address the situation. Interior Minister Ahmad al-Hajjar, after visiting the injured UNIFIL officers in the hospital, reiterated the government's condemnation of the attack. UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, labeled the assault as unacceptable, emphasizing that such violence jeopardizes the safety of UN personnel dedicated to maintaining Lebanon's stability. Prime Minister Nawaf Salam also denounced the attack, pledging to apprehend those involved. The Lebanese Army reported that areas surrounding the airport have experienced demonstrations characterized by vandalism and clashes, including assaults on military personnel and damage to vehicles. Footage circulating on social media depicts protesters, some masked and bearing Hezbollah flags, attacking individuals near the torched UNIFIL vehicle. This unrest follows Lebanon's revocation of landing permissions for Iranian flights, a decision influenced by Israeli claims that Iran is using civilian aircraft to smuggle funds to Hezbollah. In retaliation, Iran has barred Lebanese planes from repatriating citizens stranded in Iran, escalating tensions between the two nations. The ceasefire agreement, effective since November 27, stipulates that the Lebanese military deploys in the south alongside UN peacekeepers as the Israeli army withdraws over a designated period, recently extended to February 18. A senior Israeli security official confirmed readiness to transfer control of these areas to the Lebanese Army within the agreed timeline. Hezbollah, expected to vacate its southern positions near the Israeli border during this period, has distanced itself from the attack on the UNIFIL convoy. The situation remains volatile, with international stakeholders closely monitoring developments to prevent further escalation.The post Lebanon calls emergency security meeting after UNIFIL protest attack first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lebanon-security-meeting-unifil-attack/	2025-02-15T08:34:00-08:00	
Saudi Arabia to host Arab summit on Trump’s Gaza plan	Saudi Arabia is set to host a high-level summit on February 20, bringing together the leaders of four key Arab nations to discuss the controversial proposal put forward by U.S. President Donald Trump regarding the future of Gaza. The meeting will include the heads of state from Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, with discussions expected to focus on Trump’s suggestion of a U.S.-controlled Gaza and the forced relocation of its Palestinian population. A source familiar with the summit’s preparations indicated that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is also slated to attend. The summit comes ahead of an Arab League gathering in Cairo, where regional leaders will further deliberate on the matter. Trump’s proposal, which has drawn widespread condemnation, involves the United States assuming control over Gaza and relocating over two million Palestinians from the war-ravaged enclave. His suggestion cited Egypt and Jordan as potential resettlement destinations, an idea that has been met with fierce resistance across the Arab world. The U.S. president unveiled this plan during Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s recent visit to Washington. However, the prospect of mass displacement has triggered strong reactions, with Arab nations uniting in opposition. For Palestinians, such a move evokes painful memories of the Nakba, the mass expulsion that accompanied Israel’s establishment in 1948. In response to the backlash, Trump has reportedly hinted at cutting financial aid to Egypt and Jordan if they refuse to comply with his plan. Jordan, already home to over two million Palestinian refugees, faces growing pressure as half of its 11 million residents are of Palestinian descent. Egypt, in contrast, has proposed an alternative plan centered on Gaza’s reconstruction while ensuring that Palestinians remain in their homeland. The Egyptian initiative underscores a broader regional consensus against forced displacement and seeks a sustainable resolution that safeguards Palestinian rights. The Only Plan on the Table? U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized on Thursday that Washington is open to considering alternative proposals from Arab governments regarding Gaza’s future. However, he acknowledged that, as of now, the Trump plan remains the only official proposal. In January, former Secretary of State Antony Blinken outlined a roadmap for Gaza’s post-war governance, suggesting that any long-term solution must include a clear path toward Palestinian statehood—a condition that Israel vehemently opposes. Regional powers, including Saudi Arabia, have consistently advocated for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state coexisting with Israel. U.S. Diplomatic Push and Global Engagement Rubio departed on Friday for a diplomatic tour that includes stops in Europe and the Middle East. His itinerary features a crucial meeting at the Munich Security Conference, where he will join U.S. Vice President JD Vance in discussions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The U.S. delegation’s European visit follows a surprise phone call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, during which Trump expressed his intent to broker peace negotiations to end the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. After the Munich summit, Rubio is scheduled to visit Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE to assess the fragile ceasefire in Gaza, which has been in effect since January 19. This truce remains tenuous, with both Israel and Hamas accusing each other of violations. Following his call with Putin, Trump hinted that their first in-person meeting could take place in Saudi Arabia, further highlighting Riyadh’s growing influence on global diplomatic affairs. Saudi Arabia’s Strategic Role Saudi Arabia, which has recently positioned itself as a central player in Middle Eastern diplomacy, officially welcomed the opportunity to host the summit. However, it has yet to confirm whether the meeting will proceed as planned. Analysts suggest that Saudi Arabia aims to reinforce its standing as a key mediator in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Riyadh also seeks to demonstrate solidarity with Egypt and Jordan, both of which are under increasing pressure due to Trump’s proposal. Some experts believe the kingdom could offer economic support to these nations in case the U.S. withdraws financial aid as a punitive measure. Saudi political analyst Suleiman Aloqeliy noted that the upcoming summit will likely focus on crafting an Arab-led alternative to forced displacement while establishing clear guidelines for regional engagement on the issue. With Qatar and Egypt already acting as mediators in the Gaza conflict, this summit could serve as a stepping stone toward forging a unified Arab stance. According to regional affairs expert Umar Karim, the gathering aims to consolidate support among Arab nations and present a collective front against forced displacement policies.The post Saudi Arabia to host Arab summit on Trump’s Gaza plan first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/saudi-arabia-host-arab-summit-trumps-gaza-plan/	2025-02-15T08:33:54-08:00	
Rubio: US open to Arab proposals on Gaza	Israeli soldiers will be departing Lebanese territory, transferring control of the area to the Lebanese Army under a French-American-brokered ceasefire agreement, a senior Israeli security minister stated. This truce, in effect from November 27, requires the deployment of Lebanon's military in the south alongside United Nations peacekeepers, with the withdrawal of the Israeli army initially scheduled for more than 60 days, then later extended to February 18. Throughout these weeks, Hezbollah will also have to withdraw its fighters from the area near the Israeli border. The government, said on condition of anonymity, emphasized that Israel remains committed to the U.S.-monitored accord and is working closely with the U.S. to finalize the handover of responsibility to the Lebanese Army on schedule. But Lebanese Speaker Nabih Berri stated that the U.S. informed him that Israel wishes to retain five locations following withdrawal, which Lebanon rejects. The Israeli official from the government refused to answer if the pullout includes the five areas, but did admit the military is proceeding with an agreement to turn over control along the Blue Line to the Lebanese Army. Despite the planned pullout, Israel continues to monitor Hezbollah's actions, noting attempts to break the agreement through acts such as penetration of southern borders in civilian attire, regaining or relocating weapons, and smuggling weapons within the Bekaa Valley. Both the U.N. and Hezbollah have accused Israel of ceasefire violations. The conflict between Hezbollah and Israel grew more intense for longer than a year, resulting in two months of intense battle before the November 27 agreement came into force. Hezbollah, backed by Iran, said that its combat was in support of Hamas in Gaza, where Israel had been engaged in a protracted war for over a year before a tentative truce was brokered in January. In recent developments, Arab nations, led by Saudi Arabia and Egypt, are competing to develop an alternative Gaza plan, in reaction to U.S. President Donald Trump's proposal to relocate Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring countries. The new Egyptian plan revolves around the governance of Gaza without Hamas, foreign participation in reconstruction, and transitioning towards a two-state solution. The plan is to be discussed at an upcoming Arab summit on February 27. In addition to that, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will visit Israel and other Arab nations from 13 to 18 February, following President Trump's provocative proposal that the U.S. should take over Gaza. During his visit, Rubio will focus on Gaza's situation and the implications of the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks on Israel. These diplomatic efforts underscore the complex and dynamic character of the Middle East as regional and global actors move to contain existing tensions and search for durable solutions.The post Rubio: US open to Arab proposals on Gaza first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/rubio-us-open-arab-proposals-gaza/	2025-02-14T09:35:54-08:00	
Israeli security official: Army preparing to withdraw from Lebano...	The Israeli military has stated that it is ready to pull out of Lebanese territory and transfer control to the Lebanese army within the timeframe established by a U.S.-French-mediated ceasefire agreement. This ceasefire, effective November 27, stipulates that Lebanon's military and United Nations peacekeepers will take over the south as Israeli soldiers withdraw within 60 days, later extended until February 18. Hezbollah would also be required to vacate its positions on the Israeli border during this period. An Israeli senior security source, who did not want to be named, confirmed that the army is holding fast to the U.S.-monitored agreement and is in close coordination with the U.S. to transfer responsibility to the Lebanese Army according to schedule. Nevertheless, the official refused to comment whether the withdrawal is for the five locations Lebanese Speaker Nabih Berri cited, stating that the U.S. informed him that the U.S. informed him that Israel has made up its mind to remain in these locations after the deadline—a move Lebanon is against. The Israeli military keeps a watchful eye on Hezbollah's activities, blaming efforts to breach the agreement by operating in the form of civilians, gathering or transferring weapons, and Bekaa Valley arms smuggling. Meanwhile, both Hezbollah and the United Nations have blamed Israel for violations of the ceasefire. The conflict between Hezbollah and Israel continued for over a year, peaking at two months of intense combat before the November 27 agreement became operative. Hezbollah stated its actions were in solidarity with the Palestinian militant organization Hamas in Gaza, where Israel had been fighting a protracted war before an uneasy truce was arranged by international mediators in January. With the February 18 deadline approaching, France has proposed a plan to accelerate the Israeli pullout. The plan involves United Nations peacekeepers, including French troops, replacing Israeli troops at key locations to allay Israel's security concerns and allow for a complete withdrawal. The United Nations prefers the plan, which calls for UNIFIL peacekeepers to replace Israeli observation posts. Despite all these, tensions remain elevated, each accusing the other of violating ceasefire agreements. Things are also complicated by local political trends, such as the recent downfall of Syria's Bashar Assad, long accused of being behind the assassination of Lebanese ex-PM Rafik Hariri. Hezbollah, suspected of Hariri's assassination by a U.N.-supported tribunal, is also at a crossroads after the assassination of its leader, Hassan Nasrallah. These events have far-reaching implications for Lebanese politics and the wider Middle East.The post Israeli security official: Army preparing to withdraw from Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-army-preparing-withdraw-lebanon/	2025-02-14T09:35:46-08:00	
Breaking: Hamas confirms three Israeli hostages to be freed Satur...	Hamas has proceeded with the scheduled release of three Israeli hostages, defying a previous threat to delay in response to what it alleged were Israeli violations of the ceasefire accord. The step follows mediation by Egypt and Qatar to uphold the fragile truce in the Gaza Strip. The truce, which commenced on 19 January 2025, was initiated to allow for the staggered release of hostages being held by Hamas in return for Palestinian prisoners being held in Israel. So far, 21 Israeli hostages have been released, with the latest deal seeing a total of 33 hostages being released. In exchange, Israel has freed more than 730 Palestinian prisoners. The situation escalated for the worse when Hamas held Israel to blame for not abiding by its side of the truce, including allowing humanitarian aid in the form of tents and shelters into Gaza. In response, Israel, supported by U.S. President Donald Trump, threatened to resume military operations if the hostages were not handed over on time.The post Breaking: Hamas confirms three Israeli hostages to be freed Saturday first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hamas-three-israeli-hostages-freed-saturday/	2025-02-13T08:32:11-08:00	
Israel accuses Hezbollah of smuggling cash through Beirut airport	The Israeli forces accused Iran's Quds Force and Hezbollah of using civilian flights to Rafic Hariri International Airport in Beirut to transport money to be used to equip Hezbollah to carry out attacks in Israel. The efforts to block such shipments using ceasefire control mechanisms aside, efforts at such efforts at smuggling most likely succeeded, said Israeli army official Avichay Adraee. The Israeli forces reaffirmed efforts to cut Hezbollah's weapons supply and maintain ceasefire agreements to provide protection to Israeli civilians in response. The claims were denied by Iranian authorities, adding that such reports are a result of a media war effort to hinder Lebanon's reconstruction process. The Wall Street Journal said that Israel complained to the US-led ceasefire panel that Iran's envoys and others are ferrying large sums of money to Hezbollah via the airport in Beirut. Israel threatened to strike at Beirut's international airport in case such suspected efforts at smuggling continue, it said. The airport in Beirut is strictly controlled to hinder such efforts at smuggling, said a Lebanese security official. The official acknowledged that it would be difficult to carry large sums of money, yet gems and diamonds of great value can be easily carried.The post Israel accuses Hezbollah of smuggling cash through Beirut airport first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-hezbollah-smuggling-cash-beirut-airport/	2025-02-13T08:32:04-08:00	
Ortagus set for Lebanon visit to discuss Israel withdrawal	Morgan Ortagus, the U.S. deputy special envoy for Middle East peace, is expected to travel to Beirut this week, marking her second visit to Lebanon since assuming her role. According to local media reports, her visit will focus on Israel’s planned withdrawal from southern Lebanon on February 18. Ongoing Negotiations Over Israel’s Withdrawal Initially, Israel was supposed to withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon by January 26, as part of the ceasefire agreement brokered in November. However, the deadline was extended to February 18. Reports indicate that Israel is now requesting another extension, a move that has added further complexity to the situation. Ortagus' Previous Visit and Controversial Remarks During her previous visit last week, Ortagus expressed hope that Lebanese authorities would prevent Hezbollah from having any role in the newly formed government. She also praised Israel, stating she was grateful to the U.S. ally for what she described as defeating Hezbollah. Her comments sparked backlash in Lebanon, where many viewed them as interference in domestic affairs. The Lebanese Presidency distanced itself from her remarks, emphasizing that her views did not reflect the official position of the state. Despite her stance, Hezbollah has actively engaged in government negotiations, particularly regarding the allocation of Shiite Muslim seats, in line with Lebanon’s sectarian power-sharing system. Background on Ortagus’ Role Ortagus, a former U.S. State Department spokesperson and U.S. Navy Reserve officer, recently stepped into the role of deputy special envoy for Middle East peace in President Donald Trump’s administration. She replaced Amos Hochstein, who had played a crucial role in brokering the November 27 ceasefire, which ended over a year of hostilities, including two months of intense conflict. Ceasefire Terms and Challenges Under the original ceasefire agreement, the Lebanese military was to deploy in the south alongside U.N. peacekeeping forces (UNIFIL), while Israel gradually withdrew over a 60-day period. Additionally, Hezbollah was required to move north of the Litani River and dismantle any remaining military infrastructure in the south. Ortagus reaffirmed last week that the United States remains fully committed to the February 18 withdrawal deadline. Israel’s Request for Another Extension Despite the ceasefire terms, reports indicate that Israel is now seeking to extend its troop presence further and maintain control over five strategic border points, citing security concerns and the need for a buffer zone. However, Lebanon has firmly rejected this proposal. Instead, Lebanese officials have suggested that the U.N. peacekeeping forces (UNIFIL) or the Lebanese Army take control of these five key locations, rather than allowing an extended Israeli military presence. As negotiations continue, Ortagus' upcoming visit will likely play a key role in determining the next steps regarding Israel’s withdrawal timeline and the future of the ceasefire agreement.The post Ortagus set for Lebanon visit to discuss Israel withdrawal first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/ortagus-lebanon-visit-discuss-israel-withdrawal/	2025-02-12T05:49:08-08:00	
Trump vows US control of Gaza as Jordan’s king pushes back	U.S. President Donald Trump continues to push his controversial plan to relocate Palestinians and place a rebuilt Gaza under U.S. authority, despite opposition from Jordan’s King Abdullah II during a White House meeting. Following discussions with Trump, King Abdullah reaffirmed Jordan’s firm stance against any forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank. 'This is the unified Arab position,' Abdullah stated on social media, emphasizing that the priority should be on rebuilding Gaza without removing its people and addressing the worsening humanitarian crisis. However, he also acknowledged that Egypt is preparing a proposal on how regional states could engage with the U.S. administration on the matter. Jordan’s Offer and Trump's Response During the meeting, Abdullah appeared to make a goodwill gesture, proposing that Jordan could take in 2,000 Palestinian children with cancer who are in urgent need of medical care. Trump, seemingly caught off guard by the offer, responded by calling it 'a beautiful gesture', admitting that he had not been informed about it prior to the meeting. Trump’s Controversial Plan to 'Own' Gaza Trump shocked global leaders last week when he proposed that the United States 'take over' Gaza, promising to transform it into 'the Riviera of the Middle East'. However, his vision included the mass resettlement of Palestinians elsewhere, with no provisions for their return. Despite widespread criticism, Trump doubled down on the plan, insisting that the U.S. would hold and control Gaza. 'We don't have to buy it. We're going to have Gaza,' Trump stated. 'We're going to take it, we're going to hold it, we're going to cherish it.' However, he dismissed speculation that he would use his real estate background to develop Gaza personally, stating: 'No. I've had a great career in real estate.' Egypt’s Response and Arab Opposition Jordan is not alone in its opposition to Trump’s Gaza relocation plan. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who is expected to visit the White House later this week, has already called for rebuilding Gaza without displacing Palestinians. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry also released a statement confirming that it would soon present a 'comprehensive reconstruction vision' for Gaza that ensures Palestinians remain on their land. Trump’s Stance on Aid to Jordan and Egypt Prior to King Abdullah’s visit, Trump had threatened to cut U.S. aid to Jordan if it refused to accept Palestinian refugees. However, after the White House meeting, he softened his tone, saying: 'I don’t have to threaten that. I do believe we’re above that.' Nonetheless, analysts highlight that Jordan remains economically vulnerable to U.S. pressure, as it receives approximately $750 million in economic aid and $350 million in military assistance from Washington each year. Trump’s Stance on Hamas and Ceasefire Tensions The meeting took place amid growing concerns that the Gaza ceasefire is on the brink of collapse. On Monday, Trump warned that 'all hell' would break loose if Hamas failed to release all hostages by the weekend. While Trump expressed doubt that Hamas would comply, he downplayed any long-term impact on the peace process, stating: 'It's not going to take a long time. A bully is the weakest person, and they're bullies. Hamas is bullies.' Jordan’s Strategic Position and Risks King Abdullah’s strong rejection of forced Palestinian displacement reflects Jordan’s unique position in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. With nearly half of Jordan’s 11 million people of Palestinian origin, any mass relocation could destabilize the country. Following his meeting with Trump, Abdullah took to social media, reaffirming his commitment to Jordan’s stability and the well-being of its citizens—a clear message that he intends to resist U.S. pressure on the issue. As regional leaders prepare for upcoming talks in Riyadh, Egypt is expected to present its alternative proposal, setting the stage for further diplomatic maneuvering over the future of Gaza and its people.The post Trump vows US control of Gaza as Jordan’s king pushes back first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/trump-us-control-gaza-jordans-king-pushes-back/	2025-02-12T05:48:58-08:00	
Will Israel pull out of Lebanon by February 18?	With the February 18 deadline for Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon fast approaching, reports indicate that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has requested U.S. President Donald Trump to support an additional extension of the Israeli military’s deployment in the region. Israel Aims to Maintain a Buffer Zone According to a report by Israel’s Channel 12, Israel has proposed keeping its forces stationed at five strategic border locations, arguing that maintaining a buffer zone is necessary for security purposes. Israel has repeatedly insisted to the United States that the Lebanese Army has not fully deployed in the southern region, as required under the ceasefire agreement, and has failed to prevent Hezbollah from reorganizing. Israeli officials have warned that the militant group plans to return to the border areas as soon as Israeli troops withdraw. Ceasefire Agreement and Previous Deadline Extensions Under the original November ceasefire deal, all Israeli troops were supposed to exit southern Lebanon by January 26, with Lebanese military forces taking their place. However, just two days before the deadline, Netanyahu announced that Israel would not withdraw, citing Lebanon’s alleged failure to meet its commitments. Following this announcement, the White House confirmed that Israel and Lebanon had agreed to extend the withdrawal deadline to February 18. U.S. Insists on February 18 as a Firm Withdrawal Date Over the weekend, Morgan Ortagus, Trump’s deputy special envoy to the Middle East, visited Lebanon and Israel to assess the situation. Speaking in Lebanon on Friday, Ortagus reaffirmed that February 18 remains a firm deadline for Israeli forces to complete their withdrawal. 'February 18th will be the date for redeployment when the IDF completes its withdrawal,' she stated at Lebanon’s presidential palace in Baabda. She also emphasized that once Israeli forces depart, Lebanese Army units will immediately move in, reaffirming Washington’s commitment to ensuring the timeline is met. Lebanon’s Role in the Ceasefire Agreement As outlined in the original deal, the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) were expected to deploy in the south alongside U.N. peacekeeping forces while Israel withdrew over a 60-day period. Additionally, Hezbollah was required to relocate north of the Litani River, approximately 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the Israeli border, and dismantle any military infrastructure in the south. However, Israeli officials claim that their forces have continued to uncover Hezbollah weapons in restricted zones, further accusing the Lebanese military of failing to uphold its obligations under the agreement. Israel Requests Further Extension Until February 28 On Monday, Lebanese MP Nabil Bader revealed that Israel had formally requested a 10-day extension, seeking to maintain its troop presence in southern Lebanon until February 28. Meanwhile, Al-Jadeed TV reported that the ceasefire monitoring committee is set to meet before February 18, with Ortagus scheduled to return to Lebanon for further discussions ahead of the deadline. While Israeli Channel 12 reported that Israeli officials are hopeful that Washington will agree to another extension to prevent Hezbollah from re-establishing a foothold at the border, The Jerusalem Post contradicted this claim, stating that the U.S. has made it clear that no further extensions will be granted. Washington Reaffirms Israel's Withdrawal Timeline On Monday, a U.S. National Security Council spokesperson, Brian Hughes, told The Jerusalem Post that Israel remains committed to the existing timeline and has not formally requested an extension beyond February 18. Despite this statement, Israeli officials have acknowledged ongoing discussions with Washington as they attempt to negotiate improved security conditions on the ground.The post Will Israel pull out of Lebanon by February 18? first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/will-israel-pull-out-lebanon-february-18/	2025-02-11T10:45:31-08:00	
Gaza truce on edge as Trump warns Hamas of ‘hell’ over hostage re...	The fragile ceasefire in Gaza appeared increasingly unstable on Tuesday, following warnings from U.S. President Donald Trump and Hamas’ concerns that his remarks complicate ongoing negotiations. Since the truce began on January 19, there have been five hostage-prisoner exchanges, but recent tensions have put the agreement under strain. Trump warned that if Hamas fails to release all Israeli hostages by the weekend, the ceasefire should be canceled, and conflict should resume. 'If all of the hostages aren't returned by Saturday at noon, I would say cancel it, and all bets are off—let hell break out,' Trump stated on Monday. International Efforts to Preserve the Ceasefire Diplomatic efforts to safeguard the ceasefire have intensified, with Jordan’s King Abdullah II expected to raise the issue with Trump during a meeting in Washington later on Tuesday. Tensions have been rising for weeks, particularly after Trump proposed the forced displacement of Gaza’s two million residents. Hamas responded critically to Trump's latest statement, with senior leader Sami Abu Zuhri asserting that his remarks complicate the situation further and that the agreement must be respected by both parties. 'The language of threats has no value and only makes matters worse,' Abu Zuhri told AFP. Another senior Hamas official urged Trump to pressure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to comply with the deal instead of causing delays in aid delivery and blocking the agreement’s implementation. Meanwhile, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on Hamas to proceed with the next hostage release, urging both sides to avoid a return to full-scale conflict. Rising Fears Among Civilians in Gaza Many war-weary civilians in Gaza fear that the ceasefire will collapse, with some believing both Israeli and Hamas factions are interested in continuing the war. 'I pray that the ceasefire holds, but there are no guarantees,' said Adnan Qassem, a 60-year-old resident of Deir el-Balah. 'The people are the ones who suffer the most.' The armed wing of Hamas, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, announced that the hostage release scheduled for Saturday had been postponed, accusing Israel of failing to meet its commitments under the agreement, including delays in humanitarian aid and the killing of three Gazans over the weekend. Despite this, Hamas stated that the deal is still open, provided that Israel upholds its side of the agreement. Israel Signals Readiness to Resume Conflict Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz condemned Hamas' delay in the hostage release, calling it a 'complete violation' of the ceasefire deal. He also ordered the Israeli military (IDF) to prepare for any scenario, warning that Israel is ready to restart operations in Gaza. Meanwhile, negotiators are set to meet in Qatar to discuss the ongoing implementation of the ceasefire, but talks on a second phase of the deal—which were meant to start on day 16 of the truce—have stalled, with Israel refusing to send representatives to Doha. Trump’s Controversial Proposal for Gaza and Palestinian Displacement Netanyahu has expressed support for Trump’s idea of forcibly relocating Gazans, calling it a 'revolutionary approach.' The United Nations and legal experts have strongly condemned the proposal, arguing that it would be a clear violation of international law. Trump also suggested that U.S. allies Jordan and Egypt should take in displaced Palestinians—even hinting that he could withhold aid if they refuse. During a Fox News interview, Trump stated that Palestinians 'would not have the right to return to Gaza' and that they would be relocated permanently. 'If they have to return now, it will take years before it's even habitable,' he said. When asked if displaced Palestinians would be allowed to go back, Trump flatly rejected the idea, saying: 'No, they wouldn't, because they'll have much better housing elsewhere.' Palestinian Displacement Sparks Historic Parallels For Palestinians, Trump’s displacement proposal brings back painful memories of the Nakba ('catastrophe') in 1948, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were forcibly removed from their homes during the creation of Israel. Death Toll and Humanitarian Impact The Gaza war, which began after Hamas' October 7, 2023 attack, has devastated the region. The October 7 attack resulted in 1,211 deaths in Israel, with 251 hostages taken—of whom 73 remain in Gaza, including 35 the Israeli military says are dead. The Health Ministry in Gaza, which is run by Hamas, reports that at least 48,208 people have been killed since the war began. The United Nations considers these figures reliable. Earlier on Tuesday, Israeli officials confirmed the death of hostage Shlomo Mansour, an elderly man who had been held in Gaza. Ceasefire at a Crossroads As diplomatic talks continue, the next few days will be crucial in determining whether the ceasefire holds or if full-scale war resumes. With Trump pressuring Hamas, Israel preparing for renewed military action, and international mediators working to salvage the truce, the situation remains highly volatile.The post Gaza truce on edge as Trump warns Hamas of ‘hell’ over hostage release first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/gaza-truce-edge-trump-warns-hamas-hell/	2025-02-11T10:45:23-08:00	
Trump doubles down on Gaza control vow as ceasefire pressure grow...	New details emerging about the deteriorating condition of released hostages have intensified pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to extend the fragile ceasefire in Gaza, even as former U.S. President Donald Trump reiterated his pledge that the United States would take control of Gaza. Ceasefire Talks and Stalled Negotiations The second phase of negotiations, aimed at securing the release of more hostages and achieving a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, was set to begin on February 3. However, progress has been slow, despite Israeli forces withdrawing from a Gaza corridor on Sunday, in alignment with truce commitments. Netanyahu dispatched a delegation to Qatar, a key mediator in the conflict, but its low-level representation has fueled speculation that a major breakthrough is unlikely. Having recently returned from a meeting with Trump, Netanyahu is expected to convene security cabinet ministers on Tuesday to discuss the next steps. Trump's Controversial Proposal on Gaza Speaking on Sunday, Trump reaffirmed his intention for the U.S. to take control of Gaza, suggesting that America could oversee its rebuilding efforts and potentially delegate sections of reconstruction to Middle Eastern states. Trump claimed that Arab nations had signaled willingness to relocate displaced Palestinians and insisted that many Palestinians would prefer leaving Gaza if given an alternative. He justified this stance by stating that the only reason people wanted to return to Gaza was due to a lack of viable options elsewhere. The former president also expressed frustration over the state of released hostages, describing them as emaciated and resembling Holocaust survivors. He questioned how much longer the situation could be tolerated. Global Reactions and Arab Response The Israeli government, while not officially endorsing Trump’s remarks, has shown openness to the idea of resettling Gaza’s population, with Netanyahu calling it a 'revolutionary, creative vision.' However, Hamas, the Palestinian Authority, and much of the international community have strongly rejected this notion. Egypt has announced it will host an emergency Arab summit on February 27 to discuss the escalating crisis and potential population displacement. Saudi Arabia condemned Netanyahu’s recent statements, particularly his suggestion that Palestinians could establish their state elsewhere, arguing that such remarks were an attempt to divert attention from Israel’s actions in Gaza, which they described as ethnic cleansing. Qatar also denounced Netanyahu’s comments, labeling them provocative and a clear violation of international law. Hostage Families Call for Urgent Action Families of hostages who remain in captivity have voiced increasing desperation, urging Netanyahu’s government to extend the ceasefire and secure their release. Some of the newly freed hostages have described inhumane conditions, including being barefoot and in chains, with limited food and harsh treatment. Ella Ben Ami, whose father was released on Saturday, pleaded with the Israeli government to act quickly, saying that captivity was far worse than anyone had imagined. The father of Alon Ohel, another hostage still in Gaza, relayed accounts from released captives who said his son survives on half a pita or less per day. His mother, Idit Ohel, broke down in tears, revealing that her son had been shackled for over a year. Michael Levy, whose brother Or Levy was freed after 16 months in captivity, accused Israeli leadership of failing to act urgently, despite knowing the dire conditions hostages were enduring. Adding to the pressure, former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant admitted that the worsening conditions of the hostages had been known to Israeli intelligence for some time. Ceasefire Extension Uncertain The current ceasefire, which began on January 19, has held so far, raising hopes for a longer-term resolution after 16 months of war that has reshaped the geopolitical landscape in the Middle East. A key development in the ceasefire implementation came as Israeli forces withdrew from the 6-kilometer (4-mile) Netzarim corridor, a strategic military zone separating northern and southern Gaza. No troops remained in the area by Sunday. Following the ceasefire’s announcement, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians were permitted to cross Netzarim and return to the north of Gaza. However, the agreement remains highly fragile. On Sunday, three Palestinians were reportedly killed near Gaza City by Israeli fire. Israel’s military acknowledged firing warning shots and later claimed to have scored 'several hits.' The military also warned civilians against approaching their forces. Israeli troops remain stationed along Gaza’s borders with both Israel and Egypt, maintaining control over movements in and out of the enclave. Hamas Declares Victory Amid Uncertainty In response to Israel’s withdrawal from Netzarim, Hamas spokesperson Abdel Latif Al-Qanoua declared that the move proved the group had forced Israel to submit to its demands, calling it a defeat for Netanyahu’s goal of achieving total military victory. Despite these statements, Israel has insisted that it will not agree to a full withdrawal from Gaza unless Hamas’ military and political infrastructure is completely dismantled. Hamas, on the other hand, has refused to release the remaining hostages unless Israel completely pulls out. Exchange of Hostages and Prisoners The ceasefire’s first phase, lasting 42 days, has facilitated the gradual release of 33 Israeli hostages, taken captive during the October 7, 2023, attack, which marked the beginning of the war. In return, Israel has freed nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and allowed a significant increase in humanitarian aid to Gaza. However, Hamas has informed Israel that eight of the 33 hostages set for release are already deceased. While many Israeli citizens and hostage families are calling for the ceasefire to be extended, Netanyahu faces opposing pressures from far-right political allies, who insist that military operations must resume. Trump’s proposal for U.S. control over Gaza has added further complexity to the ongoing negotiations. Mounting Violence in the West Bank While the war in Gaza continues to dominate global attention, violence in the occupied West Bank has intensified in recent days. On Sunday, Israeli forces launched operations against Palestinian militants in the northern West Bank, particularly in the Nur Shams refugee camp, which has been a focal point of Israeli military action. The Palestinian Health Ministry reported that two women were killed, including Sundus Shalabi, an eight-month-pregnant woman, and Rahaf al-Ashqar, 21. The Israeli military later confirmed that police were investigating the shooting incident. Meanwhile, Israel’s Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, announced an expansion of military operations in the Jenin region, citing efforts to prevent Iran, a Hamas ally, from strengthening its influence in the West Bank.The post Trump doubles down on Gaza control vow as ceasefire pressure grows first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/trump-doubles-down-gaza-control-vow/	2025-02-10T08:49:36-08:00	
Arab nations condemn Netanyahu’s Palestinian state proposal on Sa...	Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations have strongly condemned comments made by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in which he appeared to suggest that a future Palestinian state could be established on Saudi land. Netanyahu’s remarks, which some Israeli media outlets interpreted as a joke, come at a time of heightened regional tensions, particularly following former U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to take control of Gaza and displace its population abroad. Arab League and Saudi Arabia Respond The Arab League’s Secretary-General, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, denounced Netanyahu’s comments on Sunday, calling them completely detached from reality and nothing more than fantasies and illusions. Meanwhile, the Saudi Foreign Ministry issued a strong statement of rejection, accusing Netanyahu of trying to divert attention from Israel’s ongoing crimes against Palestinians in Gaza. The ministry welcomed the collective condemnation expressed by brotherly Arab nations against the Israeli prime minister’s statements. Netanyahu’s Controversial Interview During a television interview on Thursday, Netanyahu was discussing potential diplomatic normalization with Saudi Arabia with right-wing Israeli journalist Yaakov Bardugo. At one point, Bardugo appeared to misspeak, saying that Riyadh had taken the position that there would be 'no progress without a Saudi state.' Netanyahu immediately corrected him, asking, 'Palestinian state?' Then, in what seemed like an offhand remark, the Israeli leader quipped, 'Unless you want the Palestinian state to be in Saudi Arabia. They (the Saudis) have plenty of territory.' He then shifted the conversation to the Abraham Accords, a series of agreements in which several Arab states normalized ties with Israel, stating that the peace process should be allowed to progress naturally. Widespread Regional Condemnation Despite Netanyahu’s tone, his suggestion that Palestinians could be resettled outside of Gaza and the West Bank sparked immediate backlash across the Arab world. Qatar, Egypt, and the Palestinian Foreign Ministry condemned the remarks, labeling them 'racist.' Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called the comments 'inflammatory' and a 'clear violation of international law,' emphasizing that Palestinians have the right to establish an independent, sovereign state. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) Foreign Ministry described Netanyahu’s statement as 'reprehensible and provocative,' branding it a blatant violation of international law and the UN Charter. For Palestinians, any attempt to forcibly remove them from Gaza brings back painful memories of what is known as the 'Nakba' (or catastrophe)—the mass displacement of Palestinians during the establishment of Israel in 1948. Saudi Arabia’s Strong Rejection In its official response, the Saudi government stated that Netanyahu’s 'extremist and occupying mentality' fails to grasp the deep significance of Palestinian land for its people. The Saudi Foreign Ministry further accused Israel of believing that Palestinians do not deserve to live, pointing to the destruction of Gaza and the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians as evidence of Israel’s lack of moral responsibility or human compassion.The post Arab nations condemn Netanyahu’s Palestinian state proposal on Saudi land first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/arab-nations-condemn-netanyahus-palestinian-state-proposal-saudi-land/	2025-02-10T08:49:28-08:00	
Meet Lebanon’s new ministers	After weeks of intense political negotiations, Prime Minister Nawaf Salam successfully formed a government on Saturday, marking the end of over two and a half years of caretaker leadership in Lebanon. Salam had previously committed to excluding political party members from ministerial positions, aiming to break away from Lebanon’s long-standing sectarian and corruption-linked political system. However, given the country's sectarian-based power-sharing structure, cabinet appointments were still made after consultations with political leaders. Key Ministers in Lebanon's New Government Finance – Yassine Jaber A former minister of economy and transport, Yassine Jaber has strong ties to Speaker Nabih Berri. Previously a lawmaker within Berri's Amal bloc, which is allied with Hezbollah, Jaber is not officially affiliated with any political party. His appointment, which had been leaked in advance, drew criticism from some who saw it as a political victory for Berri. The finance ministry has long been under the influence of Lebanon’s two dominant Shiite parties, making it a highly strategic portfolio. Jaber’s role will be particularly crucial as Lebanon seeks financial support to rebuild from years of economic collapse and the recent conflict with Israel. Environment – Tamara Elzein Tamara Elzein has served as Secretary-General of Lebanon’s National Council for Scientific Research since 2022. Additionally, she holds the position of Vice President of the Lebanese National Commission at UNESCO. She has an academic background in physical chemistry, earning her doctorate from Université de Haute-Alsace in France. Culture – Ghassan Salame An academic, diplomat, and politician, Ghassan Salame has previously held the culture minister role in Lebanon. He has served as a United Nations envoy to Libya, worked under former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, and contributed to UN missions in Iraq. Social Affairs – Haneen Sayed An economist and author, Haneen Sayed has extensive experience working with the World Bank, particularly on Lebanon’s response to its economic crisis and the war in neighboring Syria. Energy – Joe Saddi Joe Saddi, who holds an MBA from Cornell University, has a background in business consulting, particularly in privatization and deregulation. He was previously Senior Partner and Chairman of Strategy&’s Middle East division and Chairman of the Board at Booz & Company. According to his LinkedIn profile, Saddi was based in the United Arab Emirates, where he led privatization efforts in the energy, mining, and steel sectors while advising Middle Eastern governments on deregulation and policy reforms. His appointment marks the first time in years that the energy ministry has not been controlled by the Free Patriotic Movement (FPM)—a Christian party that was once a Hezbollah ally before their relationship deteriorated over conflicts with Israel. The FPM has no involvement in the current government. Minister for the Displaced, Technology, and AI – Kamal Shehadi Kamal Shehadi has been appointed as the minister for the displaced and state minister for technology and artificial intelligence—a challenging position in a country where electricity shortages persist for most of the day. Shehadi has worked extensively in the telecommunications and technology sectors. His LinkedIn profile indicates that he was previously based in the United Arab Emirates and holds degrees from Columbia University and Harvard University in the United States.The post Meet Lebanon’s new ministers first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/meet-lebanons-new-ministers/	2025-02-09T07:39:44-08:00	
Breaking: Israeli drone strike kills six near Lebanon-Syria borde...	An Israeli drone strike in Janata, near Lebanon’s eastern border with Syria, resulted in the death of six people and left two others injured on Saturday, according to Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency. The Israeli military confirmed the attack, stating that it targeted Hezbollah operatives who were operating within a strategic weapons manufacturing and storage facility belonging to the group. Since the ceasefire agreement was implemented in late November, marking the end of the most recent Israel-Hezbollah conflict, Israel has continued near-daily airstrikes on sites it claims are Hezbollah-linked throughout Lebanon. The ceasefire terms allow both Israel and Lebanon to engage in self-defense actions, though the agreement does not clearly define what constitutes self-defense. While the initial 60-day period for the ceasefire’s implementation concluded in late January, both sides agreed to extend the deadline until February 18.The post Breaking: Israeli drone strike kills six near Lebanon-Syria border first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strike-kills-six-lebanon-syria-border/	2025-02-09T07:39:33-08:00	
Hamas and Israel carry out fifth prisoner swap	Hamas conducted a public display on Saturday, parading three Israeli hostages before a gathered crowd in Gaza ahead of their official handover to the Red Cross. The three Israeli civilians were released in exchange for dozens of Palestinian detainees held by Israel as part of an ongoing ceasefire that has temporarily halted the conflict in Gaza. Unlike previous prisoner exchanges, where captives were transferred without public statements, the three hostages were brought onto a stage, where a masked Hamas fighter held a microphone as they were made to address the crowd. Meanwhile, a controversial proposal by former U.S. President Donald Trump to relocate the Palestinian population from Gaza has added further tension to negotiations. While Israel has welcomed the idea, Palestinians and most of the international community have firmly rejected it. Although the proposal has not yet impacted the current ceasefire phase, which is set to last until early March, it could complicate discussions for the next stage, in which Hamas is expected to release more hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire. The group may hesitate to free additional captives if it perceives that the U.S. and Israel are serious about depopulating Gaza, an act that human rights organizations argue would violate international law. The hostages released on Saturday were identified as 52-year-old Eli Sharabi, 56-year-old Ohad Ben Ami, and 34-year-old Or Levy. They were among those taken captive during the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, which triggered the war. Ahead of the exchange, dozens of Hamas fighters, masked and heavily armed, assembled at a designated location near Gaza’s central north-south highway. Some arrived in white pickup trucks mounted with weapons. A small group of onlookers gathered nearby, though Hamas fighters formed a line to maintain distance from a temporary stage set up at the scene. This marks the fifth prisoner exchange since the ceasefire took effect on January 19. So far, 18 Israeli hostages and over 550 Palestinian detainees have been freed under the agreement. The first phase of the ceasefire includes provisions for the release of 33 Israeli hostages in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, the return of displaced Palestinians to northern Gaza, and an increase in humanitarian aid to the devastated region. Additionally, last week saw the first instance since May where injured Palestinians were permitted to leave Gaza for medical treatment in Egypt. On Saturday, Israel released 183 Palestinian detainees, including 18 individuals serving life sentences for deadly attacks, 54 prisoners with long-term sentences, and 111 individuals from Gaza who were detained following the October 7 attack. The detainees, all men between the ages of 20 and 61, were viewed differently by both sides—while Israel considers them terrorists, many Palestinians regard them as fighters resisting Israeli occupation. Almost every Palestinian family has a relative, friend, or acquaintance who has spent time in Israeli prisons. In a previous truce in November 2023, more than 100 Israeli hostages were freed in a weeklong ceasefire. However, more than 70 remain in Gaza. Israel estimates that 34 of them were either killed during the initial attack or died while in captivity. According to Israeli sources, Hamas has confirmed that eight of the 33 individuals set for release in the first phase of the ceasefire are deceased. It remains unclear whether Israel and Hamas have entered negotiations for the second phase of the truce, which would involve the release of the remaining Israeli hostages and a potential extension of the ceasefire. If no agreement is reached, the war could resume in early March. Despite the temporary pause in hostilities, Israel maintains its commitment to dismantling Hamas, even as the militant group quickly reasserted control over Gaza following the ceasefire. Within Israeli political circles, hardline figures, including members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition, are calling for an immediate resumption of military operations once the first phase of the truce is completed. Hamas, on the other hand, has made it clear that it will not release the remaining hostages without an end to the war and a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The October 7 attack that set off the conflict resulted in the deaths of approximately 1,200 people in Israel, most of them civilians. Since then, Gaza’s Health Ministry reports that more than 47,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s retaliatory air and ground operations, with over half of the casualties being women and children. Among the 72 Palestinian detainees released on Saturday, five are from East Jerusalem, 14 from Gaza, and 53 from the occupied West Bank. Seven of them are expected to be transferred to Egypt ahead of further deportation. In the West Bank, 47 prisoners were released from Ofer Prison and transferred to Palestinian custody at the Betunia crossing near Ramallah. Families, friends, and supporters had gathered there to celebrate their return, treating them as heroes. Those freed had been imprisoned for a range of offenses, including involvement in militant activities and attacks spanning decades. One of the most notable figures among them is Iyad Abu Shakhdam, 49, who spent nearly 21 years behind bars for his role in Hamas-led attacks, including a 2004 suicide bombing on a bus in Beersheba that killed 16 people, including a four-year-old child. Also released was Jamal al-Tawil, a high-profile Hamas politician from the occupied West Bank and former mayor of al-Bireh, near Ramallah. Over the past two decades, he has been repeatedly detained by Israeli authorities. His most recent arrest, in 2021, was linked to alleged involvement in violent riots and efforts to strengthen Hamas’ influence in the West Bank. He was placed under administrative detention, a system allowing suspects to be held for six months at a time without formal charges or trial. The broader conflict traces back to Israel’s capture of the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem during the 1967 Mideast war. Palestinians seek all three territories as part of their future independent state.The post Hamas and Israel carry out fifth prisoner swap first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hamas-israel-carry-out-fifth-prisoner-swap/	2025-02-08T07:37:26-08:00	
Hezbollah’s Raad blasts US official for ‘blatant interference’	The head of Hezbollah’s parliamentary bloc, Mohammad Raad, strongly criticized remarks made by visiting U.S. official Morgan Ortagus on Friday, calling them an unacceptable interference in Lebanon’s internal affairs. Raad described Ortagus’s statement as malicious and irresponsible, arguing that it directly targeted a fundamental part of Lebanon’s political structure. He accused the U.S. of blatant interference in the country’s sovereignty, rejecting Washington’s stance on Hezbollah’s involvement in Lebanon’s next government. During her visit, Ortagus had stated that the U.S. considered Hezbollah’s participation in the government a red line. She also declared that Hezbollah had been defeated by Israel, expressing gratitude to Washington’s ally for its role in weakening the group. In response to these comments, a small group of Hezbollah supporters took to the streets in protest. Waving Hezbollah’s yellow flags, they set tires on fire, blocking access to Beirut’s international airport. Some demonstrators spray-painted the Star of David alongside the words 'USA' and 'Trump' on the road, encouraging pedestrians and vehicles to trample over them. Meanwhile, Lebanon’s presidency distanced itself from Ortagus’s statements, issuing a response on X. The statement clarified that her remarks represented her personal views and that the presidency did not endorse them. A widely circulated photo from her meeting with Lebanese President Joseph Aoun added further controversy, as it showed Ortagus shaking hands with Aoun while wearing a ring featuring the Star of David, fueling discussions on social media. Another strong reaction came from Jaafari Mufti Sheikh Ahmad Qabalan, a senior Shiite cleric and close ally of Hezbollah. In his statement, he reaffirmed Hezbollah’s role as a legitimate national and representative force in Lebanon. He dismissed claims that Hezbollah had been defeated and insisted that no power on earth could eliminate the group. Qabalan emphasized that Lebanon’s sovereignty belongs exclusively to its people and national institutions, not to external forces or what he called America’s exclusionary and destructive policies. He warned that forming a government without Hezbollah and its ally, the Amal Movement, would push Lebanon into further instability and uncertainty.The post Hezbollah’s Raad blasts US official for ‘blatant interference’ first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollahs-raad-blasts-us-official-blatant-interference/	2025-02-08T07:37:15-08:00
