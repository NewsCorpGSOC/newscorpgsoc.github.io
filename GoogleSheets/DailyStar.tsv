WHO: 'Very High' Cholera Risk Spreading in Lebanon	The World Health Organization (WHO) issued a warning on Wednesday about the 'very high' risk of cholera spreading in Lebanon after a case of the disease was confirmed in the country's northern region. Abdinasir Abubakar, the WHO's representative in Lebanon, expressed concern over the potential outbreak, citing the worsening water and sanitation conditions for refugees and in vulnerable areas. He emphasized that if cholera were to reach the newly displaced population, it could spread rapidly. Lebanon experienced its first cholera outbreak in three decades between 2022 and 2023, primarily in the northern region. With over a million people displaced due to the Israel-Hezbollah conflict, Abubakar pointed to particular concerns for southern Lebanon and Beirut, where communities have not built up immunity to cholera in decades. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stated that Lebanon’s Ministry of Public Health had activated emergency measures, such as enhanced surveillance and contact tracing, after detecting the cholera case. In August, the ministry initiated a cholera vaccination campaign aimed at 350,000 people in high-risk areas, but the effort was disrupted by the ongoing violence, according to the WHO. Cholera, a disease that spreads primarily through contaminated water and food, leads to severe diarrhea and dehydration. Those living in areas with limited access to clean water or poor sanitation are especially vulnerable, as the disease can result from consuming food or water contaminated with the cholera bacteria.The post WHO: 'Very High' Cholera Risk Spreading in Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/who-high-cholera-risk-spreading-lebanon/	2024-10-17T01:02:07-07:00	
US B-2 Strikes Hit 5 Houthi Weapon Storage Sites, Defense Secreta...	The U.S. carried out airstrikes on five 'hardened underground weapons storage locations' in areas controlled by the Houthis in Yemen, using B-2 stealth bombers, according to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Wednesday evening (Thursday morning local time). Austin described the operation as a 'unique demonstration' of the U.S.'s ability to strike facilities that adversaries attempt to protect, regardless of how deeply they are buried or fortified. He emphasized that the use of B-2 Spirit long-range stealth bombers highlights America's global strike capabilities to target such locations whenever necessary. The defense secretary explained that the strikes were authorized by President Joe Biden with the aim of 'further degrading' the Houthis' ability to attack, following over a year of their assaults on U.S. and international vessels in the region. The targeted facilities housed 'various weapons components' used in these attacks. Austin added, 'We will continue to make it clear to the Houthis that there will be consequences for their illegal and reckless attacks.'The post US B-2 Strikes Hit 5 Houthi Weapon Storage Sites, Defense Secretary Confirms first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/b-2-strikes-5-houthi-weapon-storage-sites-secretary-confirms/	2024-10-17T00:33:38-07:00	
Breaking: Houthi Spokesperson Warns: US Will 'Pay the Price' for ...	Yemen's Houthi movement has declared that the United States will 'pay the price' following U.S. airstrikes against the Iran-backed group. These strikes targeted five underground weapons storage facilities, with the use of B-2 stealth bombers. Nasruddin Amer, deputy head of the Houthis' media office, made a statement on X, saying that the U.S. aggression in Yemen would not deter them from their stance in support of Gaza. The Houthis have been targeting ships in the Red Sea for months, a critical global shipping route, claiming their actions are in response to Israel's war in Gaza. Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis form part of an Iran-led alliance that spans across Yemen, Syria, Gaza, and Iraq. This coalition has been attacking Israel and its allies since the onset of the conflict and has vowed to continue until a ceasefire is achieved in Gaza. The U.S. strikes on Yemen occur amidst rising tensions across the region. Israel is anticipated to retaliate against Iran for a recent missile attack, all while dealing with intensifying conflicts with Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza.The post Breaking: Houthi Spokesperson Warns: US Will 'Pay the Price' for Yemen Strikes first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/houthi-warns-us-pay-price-strikes/	2024-10-17T00:32:59-07:00	
Gallant: Truce Talks in Lebanon Must Happen ‘Under Fire’	Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant emphasized on Wednesday that any negotiations aimed at ending the conflict in Lebanon must take place 'under fire.' He made this statement during an assessment of the situation on the northern front. During his meeting with commanders of the reservist 146th Division, Gallant pointed out that the recent capture of Hezbollah operatives in southern Lebanon highlighted both the Israeli army's effectiveness and the challenges faced by Hezbollah, according to a statement from the Defense Ministry. 'We are gaining valuable insights through interrogation, information that we would not have otherwise obtained, and it will serve us well in the near future,' Gallant said. He also added that the ongoing ground operations will enable displaced residents of northern Israel to return to their homes.The post Gallant: Truce Talks in Lebanon Must Happen ‘Under Fire’ first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/truce-talks-lebanon-must-happen-under-fire/	2024-10-17T00:32:18-07:00	
Macron Riles Netanyahu with Sharp Comment on Israel’s Founding	French President Emmanuel Macron has added further strain to the already tense relations with Israel through a recent comment regarding the founding of the Israeli state. This remark, quickly criticized by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was seen as a distortion of historical facts. Macron, aiming to take a firmer stance on Middle East conflicts following Israel’s offensive in Lebanon, a former French protectorate, stated that halting the export of weapons used by Israel in Lebanon and Gaza was the only way to end the ongoing conflicts. France, which has the largest Jewish population in Europe, has repeatedly called for a ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon, while also increasingly condemning Israel for the civilian casualties in these areas. Paris has also expressed outrage over Israeli attacks on the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which includes 700 French troops. In another sign of escalating tensions, organizers of the upcoming Euronaval defense show in Paris announced that, following a French government decision, Israeli exhibits and stands would be excluded from the event. Macron’s Controversial Remarks During a closed-door meeting at the Elysee Palace, Macron stated, 'Mr. Netanyahu must not forget that his country was created by a decision of the U.N.,' referencing the 1947 U.N. General Assembly resolution to partition Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state. He added that this is not the time to disregard U.N. decisions. These comments were shared by two meeting participants who spoke anonymously to AFP. Netanyahu responded to Macron’s statement, asserting that Israel’s establishment was a result of victory in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, not a U.N. resolution. He also highlighted the contribution of Holocaust survivors, including French Jews, who fought for Israel’s independence after surviving Nazi occupation and persecution during World War II. 'A reminder to the president of France: It was not the U.N. resolution that established the State of Israel, but rather the victory achieved in the war of independence with the blood of heroic fighters, many of whom were Holocaust survivors — including from the Vichy regime in France,' Netanyahu said. Tense Phone Call The tense nature of the exchange between the two leaders was evident in a late-night summary of their phone call released by the French presidency. Macron condemned 'indiscriminate Israeli strikes that only add to an already intolerable human toll, in Gaza as in Lebanon,' further highlighting the strained relations. Concerns Within the Jewish Community Macron’s remarks also sparked unease within France's Jewish community. Yonathan Arfi, president of the Representative Council of French Jewish Institutions (CRIF), warned that Macron’s comments 'dangerously strengthen the camp of those who question Israel’s right to exist.' Caroline Yadan, an MP from Macron’s party, expressed concern, asking, 'What does this statement imply? That what the U.N. has done, the U.N. can undo? Is this a warning?' The French left-leaning newspaper *Liberation* remarked that Macron’s comments have caused uncertainty and division among his supporters, noting that the president’s words have 'sown trouble in the macronie.'The post Macron Riles Netanyahu with Sharp Comment on Israel’s Founding first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/macron-riles-netanyahu-comment-israels-founding/	2024-10-17T00:30:52-07:00	
Watch: Tuchel Set to Be Unveiled as New England Manager	Former Chelsea head coach Thomas Tuchel is set to take over as the manager of the England men's national team, becoming the third foreign manager in the role after Sven-Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello. The German coach, who led Chelsea to Champions League glory in 2021 and enjoyed successful stints with PSG, Bayern Munich, and Borussia Dortmund, is expected to officially take charge in January 2025. According to Sky Germany, Tuchel is poised to sign an 18-month contract, which will run until the end of the 2026 World Cup. The deal was reached after several discussions with the Football Association (FA), with an announcement anticipated on Wednesday, October 16. With Tuchel's impressive track record, the FA hopes he can help end England’s 58-year wait for a major tournament victory. The FA decided against appointing an English manager to succeed Gareth Southgate, who consistently guided England to the knockout stages of major tournaments but fell short of winning a title. Southgate stepped down after the Euro 2024 final loss, and Lee Carsley has been serving as interim manager since August. Tuchel previously managed Chelsea from January 2021, leading the club to Champions League success shortly after his arrival, as well as winning the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup. Despite a successful tenure, he was sacked in September 2022. Following his departure from Chelsea, Tuchel was appointed head coach of Bayern Munich, where he won an 11th consecutive Bundesliga title. However, his time at Bayern also saw the club endure its first trophyless season in 12 years. As Tuchel prepares to take over from Southgate, he will inherit a talented squad featuring the likes of Harry Kane, Jude Bellingham, and Cole Palmer, positioning England as strong contenders for the 2026 World Cup. Commenting on the potential appointment, England captain Harry Kane told Sky Germany, 'I know Thomas well from last year. He’s a fantastic coach and person, so I’m sure the FA will contact me when they have more information.' Southgate's tenure saw England reach consecutive Euro finals, as well as a World Cup semi-final and quarter-final, but the nation still awaits its first major tournament win since the 1966 World Cup.The post Watch: Tuchel Set to Be Unveiled as New England Manager first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/tuchel-unveiled-new-england-manager/	2024-10-16T01:16:53-07:00	
Breaking: Mikati Pledges to Strengthen Army in South After Ceasef...	Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati announced on Tuesday that Lebanon is prepared to strengthen its military presence in the southern region after a ceasefire is established, noting that Israeli forces have been making brief incursions across the border. In an interview with AFP, Mikati said, 'We currently have 4,500 soldiers stationed in southern Lebanon, and we are looking to increase that number to between 7,000 and 11,000.' He added that once a ceasefire is in place, Lebanon will be able to redeploy soldiers from other parts of the country to the south. He also mentioned reports of 'brief Israeli incursions' into southern Lebanon. Mikati further revealed that security measures have been intensified at Beirut's only airport to eliminate any possible justification for an Israeli attack. 'The government is doing everything within its power to prevent any pretexts from being used by Israel,' he said, adding that 'enhanced security has been implemented at the airport,' which is near Hezbollah's stronghold in southern Beirut, an area heavily targeted by Israeli airstrikes.The post Breaking: Mikati Pledges to Strengthen Army in South After Ceasefire first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/mikati-strengthen-army-south-ceasefire/	2024-10-16T00:54:37-07:00	
Hezbollah Strikes Haifa, Threatens Attacks Across All of Israel	Hezbollah issued a strong warning on Tuesday, threatening to strike targets across Israel while vowing that it would not be defeated despite the ongoing heavy bombardment of its strongholds and leadership by Israeli forces. In the latest developments of the conflict, Hezbollah claimed responsibility for launching rockets towards the northern Israeli city of Haifa. In response, Israel carried out airstrikes in several areas of Lebanon. Hezbollah’s deputy chief, Naim Qassem, delivered a defiant speech, asserting that the group 'will not be defeated' in its battle against Israel. 'Since the Israeli enemy has targeted all of Lebanon, we have the right, from a defensive stance, to hit any location in Israel, be it in the center, north, or south,' Qassem declared. He also called for a ceasefire, stating, 'The solution is a ceasefire.' Iran, a key supporter of Hezbollah, has been involved in diplomatic efforts to broker a ceasefire in both Lebanon and Gaza, as concerns about a wider regional conflict escalate. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati told AFP that Lebanon is prepared to bolster its military presence in the south once a ceasefire is established. He also noted that Israeli forces have made brief incursions across the Lebanese border. Amid these tensions, Israel has intensified its offensive in the Gaza Strip, where the United Nations warned on Tuesday that aid restrictions have reached their worst level since the conflict began over a year ago. Israel is also contemplating its response to Iran’s October 1 missile attack, which involved about 200 missiles. This attack was a retaliation for an Israeli strike in Beirut that killed Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and Iranian General Abbas Nilforoushan on September 27. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office stated that Israel — not the United States — would decide how to retaliate. U.S. President Joe Biden, whose administration is Israel’s top arms supplier, has cautioned against striking Iran’s nuclear or oil facilities to prevent a broader war. However, according to a report in The Washington Post, Netanyahu assured the U.S. that Israel would only target military sites. A subsequent statement from Netanyahu’s office reaffirmed that while Israel listens to U.S. advice, it will make final decisions based on its own 'national interest.' Meanwhile, top Iranian commander Esmail Qaani, who had been absent from the public eye, appeared at the funeral of General Nilforoushan in Tehran, dispelling rumors of his death in an Israeli strike. In Lebanon, Israeli airstrikes on Tuesday hit the eastern Bekaa Valley, putting a hospital in Baalbek out of service. Residents described it as one of the most violent nights since the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. An Israeli airstrike on the Christian-majority village of Aito on Monday reportedly killed 21 people, including 12 women and two children, according to the United Nations. The U.N. has called for a 'prompt, independent and thorough investigation' into the strike. The ongoing war in Lebanon has claimed at least 1,315 lives, according to Lebanese health ministry figures, though the actual toll is believed to be higher. The conflict has displaced at least 690,000 people, according to the International Organization for Migration. The Lebanese health ministry reported that 41 people were killed in Israeli airstrikes on Monday, bringing the total death toll since Israel’s intensified air campaign in Lebanon, which began on September 23, to 1,356.The post Hezbollah Strikes Haifa, Threatens Attacks Across All of Israel first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-strikes-haifa-threatens-attacks-across-all-israel/	2024-10-16T00:53:37-07:00	
Qassem Warns Israel: Ceasefire Is the Solution, Threatens to Targ...	Hezbollah's deputy chief, Sheikh Naim Qassem, warned on Tuesday that a ceasefire is the only solution to the ongoing war, asserting that the group will not be defeated. In a televised speech, Qassem stated that since Israel had targeted all of Lebanon, Hezbollah has the right to strike any part of Israel, including its center, north, or south. He addressed the Israeli population, saying, 'The solution is a ceasefire&#8230; Hezbollah will not be defeated because this is our land.' Qassem emphasized that Hezbollah is now focused on inflicting damage on Israel, citing recent attacks on Haifa and areas beyond, such as Tel Aviv. This was his third public appearance since Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut on September 27. 'We will defeat our enemies and drive them out of our land,' Qassem declared, accusing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of seeking to create a 'new Middle East' aligned with Israeli and U.S. interests. He encouraged Hezbollah supporters to stay resilient under Israeli bombardment, expressing hope for victory and stating that Hezbollah would ultimately 'control the reins' of the conflict. Addressing Israelis directly, Qassem said that a ceasefire is the only way for northern Israeli residents to safely return home, stressing that Hezbollah was not pushing for a ceasefire out of weakness. He warned that if Israel continues its operations in Lebanon, Hezbollah will expand its strikes, placing over 2 million people in danger. Israeli officials have stated that their military operations in Lebanon aim to push back Hezbollah and enable displaced Israelis to return home. Qassem linked the conflict in Lebanon to the broader Palestinian struggle and the war in Gaza, asserting, 'We cannot separate Lebanon from Palestine, or Palestine from the world.'The post Qassem Warns Israel: Ceasefire Is the Solution, Threatens to Target Entire Country first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/ceasefire-solution-threatens-entire-country/	2024-10-16T00:53:26-07:00

The Israeli Defense Ministry announced that it is accelerating the development of new technologies to combat drone attacks, following a recent Hezbollah strike that killed four soldiers. While Israel's air defense systems have been effective over the past year, particularly against rocket and missile threats, they have faced challenges in dealing with drone attacks, which have caused several fatalities. In response, the Defense Ministry tested various technologies from Israeli companies as part of a fast-tracked effort to find new solutions. The ministry will review the test results and plans to select several technologies for further development, with the goal of deploying them within the coming months.The post Israel Ramps Up Tech Development to Counter Hezbollah Drone Attacks first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-ramps-tech-counter-drone-attacks/	2024-10-16T00:53:12-07:00

In a statement on Monday, Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder announced that the team will operate a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery to protect against ballistic missile threats from Iran. This deployment follows two missile strikes by Iran on Israel amidst ongoing conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon. Ryder added that more U.S. military personnel and components of the THAAD battery will continue arriving in Israel over the next few days. While the system will soon be fully operational, the Pentagon did not disclose specific timelines due to security concerns. Iran has warned that U.S. forces could be at risk if it carries out further attacks on Israel.The post Watch: Breaking: US Troops Arrive in Israel to Support Missile Defense System first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-troops-arrive-israel-support-missile-system/	2024-10-15T05:54:24-07:00	
Breaking: Qatar Emir Accuses Israel of Executing ‘Pre-Existing Pl...	On Tuesday, Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani accused Israel of deliberately escalating the conflict in the Middle East to execute long-standing plans for the West Bank and Lebanon. Speaking to Qatar's Shura Council, the Emir emphasized that Israel had the option to de-escalate tensions at the Lebanon border by ending its 'war of extermination' in Gaza but instead chose to broaden its aggression. He stated that Israel is taking advantage of the situation to carry out premeditated actions in the West Bank and Lebanon, adding that the nation sees an opportunity to do so. Qatar has been actively involved in diplomatic efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and has also pushed for a truce in Lebanon, where Israeli operations against Hezbollah have intensified in recent weeks. Sheikh Tamim further mentioned that Israel's aggression has now spread to Lebanon, and violence in the West Bank has surged since Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel in October of last year. He accused Israel of using the lack of international response to push forward with dangerous settlement plans in the West Bank. In his remarks, the Qatari leader reiterated that despite the current devastation, Israel will ultimately be forced to accept the internationally endorsed two-state solution. Qatar, along with other Arab nations, has consistently called for a resolution to the Palestinian issue through the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel.The post Breaking: Qatar Emir Accuses Israel of Executing ‘Pre-Existing Plans’ in Lebanon and West Bank first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/qatar-accuses-israel-executing-pre-existing-plans-lebanon-west-bank/	2024-10-15T05:34:43-07:00	
Israeli Airstrikes Pound Eastern Lebanon Overnight	On Tuesday, Israeli forces launched airstrikes on eastern Lebanon, as reported by Lebanon's state media. This came amid ongoing clashes between Hezbollah and Israeli soldiers, following Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's vow to take aggressive action against the group. Netanyahu's statement on Monday followed a Hezbollah drone attack on an Israeli base, which resulted in the deaths of four soldiers and injuries to 60 others. He declared, 'We will continue to strike Hezbollah mercilessly across Lebanon, including in Beirut,' during a visit to a military base near Binyamina, south of Haifa. Hezbollah announced that its fighters engaged Israeli troops attempting to infiltrate near the village of Rab Tlatin. The group also launched missiles at Israeli soldiers and rockets into northern Israel, where sirens were triggered in response. In retaliation, Israel's military claimed to have killed dozens of Hezbollah fighters in close-quarters combat over the past day. The war, which intensified after Israel expanded its operations in Lebanon last month, has led to the deaths of at least 1,315 people, according to Lebanon's health ministry, though the actual toll may be higher. Early Tuesday, Israeli airstrikes targeted the eastern Bekaa Valley, which knocked a hospital in Baalbek out of service, as reported by Lebanon's National News Agency (NNA). The International Committee of the Red Cross expressed concerns about attacks on ambulances and health facilities, calling them 'deeply troubling.' Israeli strikes have also hit Hezbollah-controlled regions and other areas in Lebanon, including a predominantly Christian village in the north where at least 21 people were killed on Monday, according to Lebanon's health ministry. Rescue operations have become increasingly challenging, with civil defense chief Anis Abla in Marjayoun stating that 'rescue missions are becoming more difficult' due to the ongoing strikes targeting even the rescue workers. Israel has stated its intention to push Hezbollah back to secure its northern border, allowing residents displaced by rocket attacks to return safely. In the northern Israeli village of Kfar Kara, Yousef, a restaurant manager, expressed concerns after Hezbollah's recent attack on a nearby military base. 'Now they know where that base is, what if next time they fire and miss by a little?' he said. Hezbollah stated that its rocket attack on Tel Aviv's suburbs was a response to Israeli strikes, including one in Beirut last week that killed 22 people. Hezbollah has also said its actions are in solidarity with Hamas, following the group’s October 7 assault on Israel, which sparked the ongoing Gaza conflict. The war in Lebanon has displaced approximately 690,000 people, according to the International Organization for Migration. Meanwhile, Israel faces growing criticism over injuries sustained by UN peacekeepers deployed in Lebanon, with the U.N. Security Council expressing concern on Monday. Despite Netanyahu's request for UNIFIL (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) to withdraw, U.N. peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix confirmed that the peacekeepers will remain in place. Jordan’s King Abdullah II also cautioned that the situation could escalate into a 'regional war that will be costly for all,' during a meeting with Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati. Meanwhile, Israel is still weighing its response to an October 1 missile attack by Iran, which was launched in retaliation for Israeli operations that killed Tehran-aligned militant leaders. Reports from U.S. officials indicate that Israel is planning a counterattack targeting Iranian military sites, but avoiding nuclear and oil facilities.The post Israeli Airstrikes Pound Eastern Lebanon Overnight first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-airstrikes-pound-eastern-lebanon-overnight/	2024-10-15T05:34:31-07:00

Report: Israel Seeks 10-Km Buffer Zone in South Lebanon	Israel intends for its forces to penetrate up to three kilometers into southern Lebanon to eliminate Hezbollah's presence and withdraw after completing this mission, according to diplomatic sources. The plan is not for Israel to maintain a long-term presence in the area but to execute the operation swiftly, U.S. officials informed Lebanon, as cited by *al-Akhbar* newspaper. The Americans recognized that 'Israel is determined to turn the area into a scorched zone and is unwilling to allow anything to obstruct its efforts,' the sources indicated. While Israel has not abandoned the idea of creating a 10-kilometer buffer zone, it envisions that the remaining seven kilometers will be managed by UNIFIL and the Lebanese Army. If these forces do not meet expectations, Israel is prepared to take on the task later, the sources concluded.The post Report: Israel Seeks 10-Km Buffer Zone in South Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-seeks-10-km-buffer-zone-south-lebanon/	2024-10-15T05:33:54-07:00	
Breaking: US Deploys Anti-Missile Defense System and 100 Troops t...	The THAAD defense system is one of the U.S. military's most advanced anti-missile weapons, designed to intercept ballistic missiles at distances ranging from 150 to 200 kilometers (93 to 124 miles) with an exceptional success rate during testing. Known as the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), this system utilizes sophisticated radar and interceptor technology, making it the only U.S. missile defense system capable of engaging and neutralizing short, medium, and intermediate-range ballistic missiles both inside and outside Earth's atmosphere during their terminal flight phase. THAAD interceptors are non-explosive, destroying incoming missiles through direct impact. According to a Congressional Research Service report, the U.S. military operates seven THAAD batteries. Each battery includes six truck-mounted launchers (equipped with eight interceptors each), a powerful radar system, and a fire control and communications unit. One of these THAAD batteries is being sent to Israel to strengthen its missile defense capabilities following Iran’s missile attacks on Israel on April 13 and October 1, as reported by the Pentagon. The deployment will involve around 100 U.S. troops on the ground to operate the system. THAAD systems are designed to integrate seamlessly with other U.S. missile defenses, such as the Aegis systems aboard Navy ships and Patriot missile defense systems, further enhancing Israel’s defense capabilities. The decision to send THAAD reflects the Biden administration's emphasis on protecting Israel from further missile threats. While the Pentagon has not specified when THAAD will become operational in Israel, the system can be rapidly deployed by Air Force cargo planes like the C-17 and C-5. One key to THAAD's precision is its advanced radar system, the AN/TPY-2, which can detect and track missiles at ranges of up to 3,000 kilometers (1,865 miles) in its forward-based mode. This radar can also track missiles during their descent in terminal mode. Since Israel is approximately 1,700 kilometers (1,100 miles) from Iran, THAAD’s capabilities make it a vital asset in Israel's defense. THAAD’s deployment is expected to work in conjunction with Israel's existing missile defense systems, adding another layer of protection. Military analyst Cedric Leighton described THAAD as a 'deterrent' that will bolster Israel's air and missile defense network. Israel already possesses multiple missile defense systems, such as David’s Sling, which can intercept targets up to 300 kilometers away using Stunner and SkyCeptor interceptors. Additionally, Israel's Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 systems, co-developed with the U.S., are designed to take down ballistic missiles during their terminal and space-based phases, respectively. The Iron Dome serves as the defense against short-range projectiles with its 10 batteries and mobile missile launchers. This isn’t the first time the U.S. has sent a THAAD battery to Israel, with a similar deployment occurring in 2019 for training exercises. Globally, THAAD deployments are closely monitored by U.S. rivals. For instance, China expressed strong opposition to the THAAD deployment in South Korea in 2017, concerned that the radar could be used to monitor activities deep inside China. The U.S. has also stationed THAAD systems in Guam to protect military bases there from potential missile threats from North Korea or China.The post Breaking: US Deploys Anti-Missile Defense System and 100 Troops to Israel first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-deploys-anti-missile-defense-system-troops-israel/	2024-10-14T02:51:35-07:00	
Breaking: Israeli Airstrike Hits Gaza Hospital Courtyard, Killing...	Four people were killed on Sunday by an Israeli airstrike targeting a hospital courtyard in central Gaza, where displaced Palestinians had been seeking refuge, according to officials from Al Aqsa hospital and civil defense. The Gaza Government Media Office reported that another 40 people were injured in the strike. Approximately 5,000 people had been sheltering at the hospital grounds, according to hospital officials. The Gaza Government Media Office stated that this was the seventh time the camp within the Al-Aqsa hospital grounds in Deir al-Balah had been hit since January. The office called on the international community to intervene and pressure Israel to halt attacks against civilians. In response, the Israeli military said it carried out a targeted strike on a Hamas command center that had been situated within a compound that formerly housed the Shuhadah Al-Aqsa hospital. The military added that it took precautions to avoid civilian casualties and placed the blame on Hamas for using civilian infrastructure. Israeli airstrikes in Gaza on Sunday claimed at least 40 lives, including 13 children, with many of the injured brought to Al-Aqsa hospital for treatment.The post Breaking: Israeli Airstrike Hits Gaza Hospital Courtyard, Killing 4 and Injuring 40 first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-airstrike-hits-gaza-hospital-injuring-40/	2024-10-14T02:25:50-07:00

15 Killed in Triple Israeli Strikes Near Hezbollah Strongholds	Lebanon's health ministry announced on Saturday that Israeli airstrikes had killed at least 15 people in areas outside Hezbollah's usual strongholds, revising earlier casualty figures. In the village of Maaysra, located in Keserwan north of Beirut, the ministry reported 'nine dead and 15 wounded' from an Israeli strike, updating the initial toll of five dead. Another strike in Deir Billa, near Batroun in the north, left two people dead, four injured, and 'unidentified body parts.' Additionally, four people were killed and 18 wounded in Barja, located in the Chouf district south of Beirut, where an earlier toll had listed 14 wounded.The post 15 Killed in Triple Israeli Strikes Near Hezbollah Strongholds first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/15-killed-triple-israeli-strikes-hezbollah-strongholds/	2024-10-14T02:25:24-07:00	
Israeli Strike Hits Market in Nabatieh	Lebanese state media reported that on Saturday, an Israeli airstrike hit a marketplace in Nabatiyeh, a significant city in southern Lebanon located approximately 12 kilometers (seven miles) from the Israeli border. According to the state-run National News Agency (NNA), 'Israeli warplanes carried out a strike that targeted the center of the marketplace' in Nabatiyeh. This followed a warning issued by the Israeli military last week, advising residents to evacuate the city.The post Israeli Strike Hits Market in Nabatieh first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strike-hits-market-nabatieh/	2024-10-14T02:25:04-07:00	
Drone from Lebanon Hits Israeli Base, Injures 60 Troops, Some Cri...	On Sunday, an Israeli volunteer rescue organization reported that more than 60 Israeli soldiers were injured in the area south of Haifa. This followed a drone attack claimed by Hezbollah, which targeted a military base in the region. United Hatzalah, the rescue service, stated on its Facebook page, 'With assistance from our ambulance teams, we helped over 60 individuals who sustained injuries of varying severity—ranging from critical and serious to moderate and mild.' Earlier in the day, Hezbollah, which is currently in conflict with Israel, announced that it had launched 'a squadron of attack drones' at a military training facility in Binyamina, located south of Haifa. The strike was said to be in retaliation for Israeli airstrikes, particularly on areas in Beirut, including Noueiri and Basta. This incident occurred just two days after air raid sirens were triggered in central Israel following the incursion of two drones from Lebanon. During that event, at least one building north of Tel Aviv was damaged. Hezbollah has been launching rockets and drones into Israel regularly for over a year, but the range of these attacks has increased since the conflict escalated in late September. Israel's advanced air defense systems, such as the Iron Dome, have intercepted the majority of the projectiles, minimizing casualties from the strikes or falling debris.The post Drone from Lebanon Hits Israeli Base, Injures 60 Troops, Some Critically first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/drone-lebanon-hits-israeli-base-injures-60-troops/	2024-10-14T02:24:44-07:00	
Taiwan on High Alert as Chinese Aircraft Carrier Group Detected t...	Taiwan announced it was on high alert after detecting a Chinese aircraft carrier group to its south on Sunday, shortly following a U.S. warning to Beijing against engaging in provocative actions toward the self-governed island. On Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken cautioned China not to respond aggressively to a speech given by Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te during the island's National Day celebrations. In recent years, China has escalated its military activities around Taiwan, regularly sending warplanes and other aircraft while its ships maintain a persistent presence near the island's waters. Taiwan's defense ministry confirmed on Sunday that the Chinese Liaoning aircraft carrier group had entered the Bashi Channel, a waterway that separates Taiwan from the Philippines, and was 'likely to proceed into the western Pacific.' The ministry emphasized that Taiwan's military is closely monitoring the situation using joint intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems, and remains ready to respond if necessary. On the same day, China's military released a video proclaiming its readiness for combat, which included a small map of Taiwan in the title. The footage, shared on the social media channels of the People’s Liberation Army Eastern Theater Command, showcased missiles, jets, helicopters, and warships, and declared that China’s forces were 'ready for battle at any time.' Taiwan and U.S. officials had previously warned of potential Chinese military drills in reaction to Lai's speech. The U.S. remains Taiwan's most significant supporter and primary supplier of weapons, though it does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taipei. Lai, who assumed office in May, has taken a firmer stance than his predecessor, Tsai Ing-wen, in defending Taiwan's sovereignty, which has angered Beijing, labeling him a 'separatist.' In his National Day speech, Lai pledged to 'resist annexation' and reaffirmed that Beijing and Taipei are 'not subordinate to each other.' Following Lai’s remarks, China warned that his 'provocations' would bring disaster to the people of Taiwan. Taiwan’s National Day on Thursday commemorated the 113th anniversary of the overthrow of China’s Qing dynasty and the founding of the Republic of China, which remains Taiwan's official name. The ongoing tension between China and Taiwan stems from a civil war in which Chiang Kai-shek’s nationalist forces were defeated by Mao Zedong’s communists, leading to the nationalists fleeing to Taiwan in 1949. The Democratic Progressive Party, led by Lai, has long supported Taiwan's sovereignty and democracy, while Beijing has worked to marginalize Taipei on the global stage by blocking its participation in international forums and drawing away its diplomatic allies. In the past two years, China has held three large-scale military exercises, deploying aircraft and ships to surround Taiwan. On Sunday, Taiwan’s defense ministry reported that 11 Chinese military aircraft and eight navy vessels were detected near the island in the 24 hours leading up to 6:00 a.m.The post Taiwan on High Alert as Chinese Aircraft Carrier Group Detected to the South first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/taiwan-high-alert-chinese-aircraft-carrier-group-detected/	2024-10-13T07:19:21-07:00	
Israel Targets Military and Energy Sites in Possible Retaliation ...	U.S. officials reportedly believe that Israel has refined its potential targets in response to Iran's attack earlier this month, focusing on military and energy infrastructure, according to NBC. The Middle East remains tense as Israel continues to confront Iran-backed groups, including Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. Iran, a key oil producer, has threatened severe retaliation if Israel launches an attack on its territory. Israel has vowed to respond to the missile strikes Iran launched on October 1, which were carried out in retaliation for Israel's military operations in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as the killings of senior Hamas and Hezbollah figures. However, according to the NBC report, Israel is not expected to target Iran's nuclear facilities or carry out assassinations, though no final decisions have been made on how or when Israel might act. There are speculations that Israel’s response could coincide with the ongoing Yom Kippur holiday. The Israeli government has not commented publicly on these reports. The conflict with Hezbollah, which began a year ago when the group launched rockets into northern Israel at the start of the Gaza war, has escalated significantly. Israel's military continues to operate in southern Lebanon, aiming to dismantle Hezbollah’s infrastructure. Over the past day, Israel’s air force reportedly struck around 200 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, including terrorist cells and missile launch sites. Meanwhile, Hezbollah announced that it had fired rockets at an Israeli military base in southern Haifa. Both sides have suffered casualties, with the Israeli military reporting injuries among its soldiers during combat in southern Lebanon, and Hezbollah continuing its rocket strikes deeper into Israel. The conflict has caused widespread displacement, with more than 1.2 million people forced to flee, according to Lebanon's government. Over 2,100 people have been killed and 10,000 wounded, including many women and children. In a recent phone call, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin expressed concern to Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over reports that Israeli forces had fired on U.N. peacekeeping positions in Lebanon, urging Israel to ensure the safety of peacekeepers and the Lebanese military. Five U.N. peacekeepers have been injured in the conflict. The escalating violence in the region, involving Tehran’s allied militant groups—Hezbollah, Yemen's Houthis, and armed factions in Iraq—has heightened fears of a broader conflict potentially drawing in the U.S. and Iran. Armed groups in Iraq have already claimed responsibility for drone attacks on Israeli military sites in the Golan Heights in solidarity with Palestinians and Lebanon. The ongoing war in Gaza, triggered by a Hamas-led assault on October 7, 2023, in which 1,200 Israelis were killed and about 250 were taken hostage, has resulted in more than 42,000 Palestinian deaths, according to Gaza's health ministry, as Israel continues its military campaign to eliminate Hamas.The post Israel Targets Military and Energy Sites in Possible Retaliation to Iran’s Missile Attack: Report first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-military-energy-sites-retaliation-irans/	2024-10-13T07:18:51-07:00	
Hezbollah Repels Two New Infiltration Attempts on Border	Hezbollah announced on Sunday that it had engaged in two separate clashes with Israeli forces attempting to infiltrate near the Lebanese border village of Ramia. According to Hezbollah, fighters set off explosive devices targeting Israeli soldiers and engaged in combat that lasted about an hour during both incidents. In addition to these encounters, Hezbollah reported carrying out several other attacks, targeting Israeli troops both within Lebanon and across the border into Israel.The post Hezbollah Repels Two New Infiltration Attempts on Border first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-repels-infiltration-attempts-border/	2024-10-13T06:55:31-07:00	
Macron Urges Hezbollah to ‘Immediately Stop’ Strikes on Israel	French President Emmanuel Macron urged Hezbollah to cease its attacks on Israel following reports from the Israeli military that a barrage of projectiles had been launched from Lebanon during the Yom Kippur holiday.

Geagea: Political Deadlock Must End for War Truce	Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea emphasized that electing a new president is crucial for securing a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. Lebanon has been without a president for nearly two years, during a period marked by a severe economic crisis and now intensified by Israeli airstrikes targeting Hezbollah positions. The country’s political factions, including Hezbollah's allies and their opponents like the Lebanese Forces, have been at an impasse over electing a president. Geagea, who leads the largest Christian bloc in parliament, stressed the immediate priority is achieving a ceasefire to alleviate the suffering of the Lebanese people. He remarked that without international initiatives, electing a president is the only viable path toward ending the conflict. Geagea, who has close ties with the United States and Saudi Arabia, accused Hezbollah earlier of dragging Lebanon into war with Israel, bypassing the state's authority. Since September 23, exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israel escalated into full-scale war, with Israel conducting heavy bombardments in southern and eastern Lebanon, as well as Beirut's southern suburbs, claiming to target Hezbollah sites. Geagea called for the election of a president who would be committed to fully implementing international resolutions, specifically U.N. Security Council Resolutions 1559, 1680, and 1701. Resolutions 1559 and 1680 call for the disarmament of non-state groups, while Resolution 1701, passed after the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, mandates that only the Lebanese Army and peacekeepers be armed and present in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah, founded after Israel’s siege of Beirut in 1982, remains the only group that retained its weapons following Lebanon’s civil war (1975-1990), justifying its stance as a 'resistance' against Israel. However, critics argue that Hezbollah operates as a 'state within a state.' Geagea asserted that the future president must ensure that all strategic decisions are made solely by the Lebanese state.The post Geagea: Political Deadlock Must End for War Truce first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/political-deadlock-must-end-truce/	2024-10-13T06:55:15-07:00	
Israeli Army Captures Hezbollah Fighter in South Lebanon Tunnel	The Israeli military announced on Sunday that its troops in Lebanon had captured a Hezbollah militant, marking the first such event since they initiated a cross-border ground operation. According to a military statement, 'During limited, localized, and targeted raids based on precise intelligence&#8230; soldiers discovered an underground tunnel shaft.' The troops surrounded the building, inspected the tunnel, and found an underground hideout where a Hezbollah fighter was located with weapons and equipment. While the military did not specify the exact timing of the capture, Hezbollah has yet to comment on the incident. The captured fighter reportedly surrendered to Israeli forces, who questioned him on-site before transferring him to a detention facility in Israel for further interrogation. A video accompanying the statement shows Israeli soldiers speaking in Arabic to the Hezbollah fighter, urging him to come out of the tunnel. 'Come out before your life is over,' the soldiers can be heard saying. The fighter then asked if they wanted a cigarette, to which a soldier humorously responded, 'Cigarettes, coffee, and $5,000.' The Israeli army began its ground offensive in southern Lebanon on September 30, conducting targeted raids in border villages. They have since discovered several tunnel shafts beneath homes, including one tunnel that was about 25 meters long and extended into Israeli territory.The post Israeli Army Captures Hezbollah Fighter in South Lebanon Tunnel first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-army-captures-hezbollah-fighter-lebanon-tunnel/	2024-10-13T06:55:05-07:00

In a video statement from his office, Netanyahu said, 'Mr. Secretary General, remove the UNIFIL forces from harm’s way. This must be done immediately.' His call comes after at least five U.N. peacekeepers were injured in recent days during ongoing clashes between Israeli forces and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.The post Netanyahu Urges UN Chief to Relocate Lebanon Peacekeepers ‘Out of Harm’s Way’ Immediately first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/netanyahu-un-relocate-lebanon-peacekeepers/	2024-10-13T06:54:55-07:00	
Nations League: Germany Near QFs with Win Over Bosnia, 10-Man Dut...	Deniz Undav netted twice as Germany secured a 2-1 victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina on Friday, moving closer to the Nations League quarter-finals, while the Netherlands salvaged a 1-1 draw in Hungary despite being down to 10 men. Germany took the lead in Zenica when Bayer Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz provided a clever backheel assist for Undav to score after 30 minutes. Undav doubled the advantage by converting a cross from Maximilian Mittlestaedt. Bosnia pulled one back with 20 minutes to go, as 38-year-old Edin Dzeko headed in from a corner, marking his 67th international goal. 'After they scored, things got tense, but we stayed in control,' said Undav, making only his second start for Germany, in an interview with RTL. The win puts Germany on seven points from three matches, two ahead of the Netherlands. The two powerhouses will clash on Monday in Munich. 'We should have scored more, given the chances we created,' said Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann. Meanwhile, at the Puskas Arena in Budapest, a minute's silence was observed in honor of Dutch football legend Johan Neeskens, who passed away at age 73. Hungary took the lead in the 32nd minute when Roland Sallai finished from close range after a pass from Zsolt Nagy, marking a great start for coach Marco Rossi in his 69th match in charge of Hungary. The hosts looked set for a win, especially after Liverpool’s Virgil van Dijk was sent off in the 79th minute. However, just four minutes later, Denzel Dumfries headed in a free-kick from Cody Gakpo to level the score. 'Even with ten men, we pushed forward,' said Netherlands coach Ronald Koeman. 'I had a feeling we would score.' Elsewhere, Wales threw away a 2-0 halftime lead to draw 2-2 with Iceland in Reykjavik. Tottenham’s Brennan Johnson, scoring in his seventh straight game, and Harry Wilson put Wales in control, but substitute Logi Tomasson struck twice in the second half, with his second goal coming after a blunder by Wales goalkeeper Danny Ward. 'I'm genuinely happy with this performance, despite the result,' said Wales coach Craig Bellamy. 'We showed a lot of positives.' In the same group, Turkey claimed a 1-0 win over Montenegro. Meanwhile, Sweden saw a 2-0 lead slip away in a 2-2 draw with Slovakia in Bratislava, leaving both teams with seven points from three games, though Sweden leads on goal difference. Yasin Ayari and Ken Sema gave Sweden an early 2-0 advantage, but David Strelec's brace helped Slovakia fight back for a point. In other results, Tomas Chory scored twice as the Czech Republic secured a 2-0 home win over Albania. The Czechs are now level on six points with Georgia, who lost 1-0 to Ukraine after Mykhailo Mudryk’s decisive goal in the 35th minute.The post Nations League: Germany Near QFs with Win Over Bosnia, 10-Man Dutch Hold Hungary first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/germany-near-qfs-win-bosnia-dutch-hold-hungary/	2024-10-12T06:39:53-07:00	
Watch: Trump Vows to Hit India with ‘Reciprocal Tariffs’ if Re-El...	In a speech on Thursday, former US President Donald Trump pledged to implement a 'reciprocal tax' if re-elected, criticizing India for imposing the highest tariffs among major countries. Speaking in Detroit, Trump emphasized the need for reciprocity in trade, highlighting that the US does not generally charge significant tariffs, while countries like China, Brazil, and especially India, impose high tariffs on American products. 'India is a major tariff charger,' Trump said. He acknowledged the strong relationship he had with India and praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a 'great leader' who has united the country. However, Trump pointed out that India, despite its friendly approach, charges very high tariffs on foreign goods, often higher than those imposed by China. He recounted an experience during his presidency when Harley-Davidson executives visited the White House, explaining the challenges they faced in India due to the high tariffs—around 150%. Trump noted that while India encouraged Harley-Davidson to set up manufacturing within the country to avoid these charges, he expressed displeasure with the situation. He explained that such practices push companies to move operations abroad, resulting in the closure of facilities in the US. Trump referred to Modi as 'the nicest human being' and a 'friend,' but also described him as a strong, determined leader. He fondly recalled Modi's visit to Houston in 2019 for the 'Howdy Modi' event, where 80,000 people welcomed them enthusiastically. Trump also shared an anecdote about a time when someone threatened India, and he offered to assist. Modi, however, confidently declined, stating that India had dealt with such threats for centuries. Trump expressed admiration for Modi's strength and leadership, reiterating the close relationship they shared.The post Watch: Trump Vows to Hit India with ‘Reciprocal Tariffs’ if Re-Elected first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/trump-hit-india-reciprocal-tariffs-re-elected/	2024-10-12T06:38:56-07:00	
Lebanon Displacement ‘Devastating’, UN Official Warns of Insuffic...	The displacement of hundreds of thousands of people in Lebanon due to intensified Israeli bombing has been described as 'devastating' by a U.N. migration official, who also emphasized that international support is falling short of the urgent needs on the ground. After a year of intermittent cross-border fire between Israel and Hezbollah, the conflict escalated last month when Israel intensified attacks on Hezbollah positions in southern and eastern Lebanon, as well as areas in southern Beirut. These strikes came after Hezbollah launched attacks on Israel in support of its ally, Hamas, which is engaged in conflict with Israel in Gaza. According to Lebanese authorities, the violence has killed hundreds and displaced over a million people, most of them since September 23. Othman Belbeisi, the Middle East and North Africa director for the International Organization for Migration (IOM), expressed concern over the scale of the displacement and the lack of sufficient aid. 'Lebanon needs more support. What has been offered so far is minimal and does not match the needs,' he told AFP during a visit to Beirut. The IOM has verified and tracked around 690,000 internally displaced people in Lebanon, with an additional 400,000 reportedly fleeing to neighboring countries, primarily Syria. Approximately 185,000 of the displaced are housed in official shelters, such as schools, while others are renting accommodation or staying with relatives. A large number are living in informal or 'host settings,' and some have no shelter at all. The situation is dire for many of those affected, with people fleeing their homes 'with nothing, out of fear,' said Belbeisi. Many now face the daunting task of rebuilding their lives, as Israeli air strikes continue in certain areas, including southern Beirut. To address the worsening humanitarian crisis, the United Nations has launched an appeal for $426 million to assist Lebanon over the next three months, including $32 million specifically for IOM efforts to support around 400,000 displaced people. However, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported on Friday that only 12 percent of the appeal has been funded, with just $51 million received so far. Lebanon has already been grappling with a severe economic crisis for the past five years, which has crippled government services and pushed many into poverty. Belbeisi emphasized the urgency of scaling up international support, saying, 'We want this displacement to end as soon as possible.' The current wave of violence between Hezbollah and Israel began in October 2023, when Hezbollah launched cross-border attacks following the outbreak of war between Hamas and Israel. Since then, the conflict has claimed more than 2,100 lives in Lebanon, with over half of the deaths occurring in the past few weeks, according to government statistics.The post Lebanon Displacement ‘Devastating’, UN Official Warns of Insufficient Support first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lebanon-devastating-un-insufficient-support/	2024-10-12T05:56:37-07:00	
Ireland Accuses Israel of Growing Hostility Toward UN Troops	Ireland’s Foreign Minister Micheal Martin on Friday condemned an Israeli military attack in southern Lebanon that left two United Nations peacekeepers injured. On Thursday, the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, UNIFIL, reported that Israeli forces had fired on their headquarters in the region, wounding two of the peacekeepers. Prime Minister Simon Harris expressed his deep concern about the incident, while Martin, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, described it as 'an extraordinary and shocking development.' 'This represents a significant escalation of hostility by the IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) against U.N. forces and posts. It is absolutely unacceptable. The actions over the past 48 hours have been reckless and intimidating,' Martin said. Ireland contributes 347 troops to the 10,000-strong UNIFIL mission, which is responsible for maintaining peace in southern Lebanon. Speaking to reporters in southwest Ireland, Martin called for the international community to take a stand and 'send a clear message to Israel that this behavior is unacceptable.' He emphasized the need for collective action, urging the global community to engage with Israel to halt such activities and ensure the safety of U.N. peacekeepers. UNIFIL had earlier expressed concern about Israeli troops operating near an outpost manned by Irish soldiers, adding to the growing unease over the situation.The post Ireland Accuses Israel of Growing Hostility Toward UN Troops first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/ireland-accuses-israel-hostility-un-troops/	2024-10-12T05:55:51-07:00	
New Israeli Attack Injures UN Peacekeepers in South Lebanon	On Friday, Lebanon condemned an Israeli attack that reportedly injured United Nations peacekeepers in the country's south, marking the second such incident in two days, according to state media. In an official statement, Lebanon's foreign ministry denounced 'the targeting by the Israeli army' of the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). The statement said the attack hit 'watchtowers, the main UNIFIL base in Ras Naqoura, and the Sri Lankan battalion’s base, causing several injuries.' The National News Agency reported that an Israeli 'Merkava tank' fired at one of UNIFIL’s observation towers on the road between Tyre and Naqoura, wounding personnel from the Sri Lankan battalion. The report added that Israeli forces also 'fired an artillery shell at the entrance of the UNIFIL command center in Naqoura, damaging the entrance.' Later in the day, UNIFIL confirmed that its Naqoura headquarters had been 'affected by explosions for the second time in 48 hours.' The statement revealed that two peacekeepers were injured when explosions occurred near an observation tower. One was taken to a hospital in Tyre, while the other was treated on-site in Naqoura. UNIFIL also reported an incident where several T-walls at their position in Labbouneh collapsed after an Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) caterpillar hit the perimeter, with IDF tanks moving close to the U.N. position. Despite the incident, UNIFIL peacekeepers remained at the location, and a Quick Reaction Force was sent to assist. UNIFIL emphasized that these incidents put peacekeepers serving under U.N. Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) at serious risk, warning that any deliberate attack on peacekeepers constitutes a grave violation of international humanitarian law. The force reiterated that the safety and security of U.N. personnel must be upheld and that U.N. premises should always be respected. On Thursday, two UNIFIL peacekeepers were injured in an earlier Israeli attack on their headquarters. Israel acknowledged that its forces opened fire in the area, claiming Hezbollah militants were operating near U.N. posts. UNIFIL, which has about 10,000 peacekeepers in southern Lebanon, has been calling for a ceasefire since September 23, following nearly a year of cross-border conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. The injured peacekeepers from Thursday’s attack, both from Indonesia, are still receiving treatment, though their injuries were not life-threatening.The post New Israeli Attack Injures UN Peacekeepers in South Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/new-israeli-attack-injures-un-peacekeepers/	2024-10-12T05:55:27-07:00

Hochstein: Working ‘Non-Stop’ to Secure Lebanon Ceasefire	The U.S. special envoy to Lebanon, Amos Hochstein, expressed that the United States is working tirelessly towards achieving a ceasefire in Lebanon. Speaking to local media, Hochstein emphasized, 'We want the entire conflict to come to an end,' in an interview with the Lebanese TV channel LBCI from Washington, adding, 'We are working on this non-stop.' Israel has intensified its strikes, targeting what it claims are Hezbollah positions, since September 23. This escalation, following nearly a year of cross-border fire, has led to the deaths of more than 1,200 people and displaced around a million from their homes. Reflecting on the situation, Hochstein condemned reports of Israeli strikes on U.N. peacekeeping posts in southern Lebanon on Friday, calling them 'unacceptable.' He also offered his condolences to the families of two Lebanese soldiers who were reportedly killed by Israeli airstrikes in the country's south on the same day. Israeli attacks have hit various areas across Lebanon, including the south, the east, and Beirut’s southern suburbs. There have also been three deadly airstrikes on central Beirut. Hochstein specifically condemned Thursday's strikes in the Beirut districts of Basta and Nweiri, which killed 22 people, calling them 'totally unacceptable.' 'We're facing an ongoing bombing campaign in Beirut, and it has to stop,' Hochstein stated. 'We’re actively working to put an end to these bombings, especially in densely populated areas of Beirut.' Earlier that same day, Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister, Najib Mikati, called on the United Nations to issue a resolution demanding an 'immediate' ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah.The post Hochstein: Working ‘Non-Stop’ to Secure Lebanon Ceasefire first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/working-non-stop-secure-lebanon-ceasefire/	2024-10-12T05:53:51-07:00	
Sikh Charity Tackles Poverty with Free Meals Initiative	A Sikh charity is providing free meals to those in need as part of its efforts to combat food poverty. Soul Aid, founded by Deepak Singh in 2017, partners with Ramjinder Maan Palvinder Singh, the owner and chef of Kulcha Express in Ilford, to deliver hundreds of free meal boxes throughout Essex. Additionally, they serve meals every Friday at a food collection point on Connaught Road, Ilford. With the help of over 100 volunteers, Mr. Singh ensures the weekly meal service is open to everyone, with no limit on the number of people who can attend. The charity was created to raise awareness about food poverty and assist those in need, regardless of their race or religion. Mr. Singh explained that the rising demand for high protein food assistance was evident, which inspired him to establish Soul Aid. Although Mr. Singh had been helping people for over two decades, he formalized his efforts through the charity. Soul Aid provides free meals, mainly traditional Punjabi cuisine, donated by Kulcha Express. They also make meal deliveries to those who request help through social media, email, or phone. Additionally, other charities inform them about people in need, and each case is carefully evaluated. Mr. Singh has observed a 50% increase in the number of people seeking free meals due to the rising cost of living. 'We’ve seen more people coming, but we’ll just serve more meals,' he said, emphasizing that they are prepared to meet the growing demand. According to the anti-poverty charity, Trussell Trust, millions of people in the UK are experiencing food poverty, with one in five children affected. Between April 2023 and March 2024, five of the nine regions in England saw an increase in food parcel distribution, with an 8% rise in the East of England alone, amounting to nearly 350,000 parcels. The latest data reveals that 6.3 million adults and 3 million children are living below the poverty line, and many are relying on food banks or at risk of doing so. The total figure of people facing hardship and hunger has reached a record high, with 580,000 more people needing assistance in 2023 compared to the previous year, and the number has risen by a million over the past five years.The post Sikh Charity Tackles Poverty with Free Meals Initiative first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/sikh-charity-tackles-poverty-free-meals/	2024-10-11T14:24:07-07:00	
White House ‘Deeply Concerned’ Over Israeli Fire on UN Peacekeepe...	The White House has expressed 'deep concern' following a report from the United Nations peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon that Israeli forces fired on locations where peacekeepers were stationed, injuring two of them. In a statement on Thursday, a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said, 'We are deeply concerned about reports that Israeli forces fired on two positions and a tower used by U.N. peacekeepers in Lebanon. We immediately reached out to our Israeli counterparts to request more information.' The statement acknowledged Israel's ongoing operations in the region to dismantle Hezbollah infrastructure that poses a threat to its citizens but emphasized that 'it is crucial these actions do not compromise the safety and security of U.N. peacekeepers.'The post White House ‘Deeply Concerned’ Over Israeli Fire on UN Peacekeepers first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/white-house-deeply-concerned-israeli-fire-un-peacekeepers/	2024-10-11T05:17:43-07:00	
Christian Villagers Trapped in Crossfire in South Lebanon	Lebanese Christian Joseph Jarjour had hoped for a peaceful retirement in his hometown of Rmeish in southern Lebanon, but instead, he now finds himself in the middle of the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. 'We're trapped,' said the 68-year-old retired teacher from Rmeish, a village located just two kilometers from the Israeli border. Following nearly a year of cross-border skirmishes, Israel launched a series of airstrikes on Hezbollah strongholds and initiated a ground offensive late last month. Rmeish, along with other Christian villages in southern Lebanon, has largely been spared the worst of the violence, but remains caught in the crossfire between the two sides. 'When Israel bombards, it flies over our heads. And when Hezbollah fires back, it also whizzes by above us,' Jarjour told AFP over the phone during a rare moment of internet access. 'We're peaceful people, we have no weapons, and we have never liked war,' he said. 'We want to stay in our homes and not have to take sides.' Since the escalation began on September 23, more than 1,200 people have been killed in Lebanon, and a million others have been displaced, according to Lebanese health ministry figures. Jarjour added that escaping from Rmeish was difficult as the roads out of the village were unsafe, making it 'very hard' to reach the capital, Beirut. - 'Hostages' - Milad al-Alam, the mayor of Rmeish, a village known for its red-roofed houses and tobacco fields, said most of its 6,000 residents have stayed despite the conflict. However, the walls of several houses have cracked from nearby explosions, and the delivery of fresh produce has stopped. To make matters worse, hundreds of people, mostly Christians fleeing neighboring areas, have sought refuge in Rmeish. 'Life has been at a standstill since October 2023,' said Alam, noting that most businesses have shut down since the fighting began. Hezbollah and Israel have been long-standing adversaries, and since Hezbollah opened a front in support of Hamas following the October 7 attack on Israel, fighting has intensified. 'Anyone who had savings has spent them over the past few months,' Alam said. During the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, most of Rmeish's residents remained in the village. Recently, Alam managed to organize a delivery of humanitarian aid to the area, under the protection of the Lebanese Army and U.N. peacekeepers. 'But we can't replace the state,' he said, lamenting Lebanon's political paralysis and ongoing financial crisis since 2019. Christian-majority villages have largely been spared the recent bombardments, unlike neighboring Shiite-majority areas, which have seen widespread destruction and evacuation. In January, Maronite Patriarch Beshara al-Rahi, the spiritual leader of Lebanon’s largest Christian community, said that villagers along the border had become 'hostages' bearing the brunt of the conflict. Lebanon is home to 18 officially recognized religious communities, with Christians making up about 30 percent of the population. - 'Bound to our land' - Last week, the Israeli military warned residents of southern Lebanon to leave their homes as it prepared for 'limited' ground incursions across the border. However, in the village of Qlayaa, just four kilometers from the border, hundreds of families have remained in their homes despite fuel and medicine shortages, and the closure of the nearest hospital. Priest Pierre al-Rahi said they had stayed because they were 'believers tied to their land.' 'We've done everything to avoid military operations or installations here,' he added. Israel occupied the village from 1982 until 2000, during which time some Lebanese Christians sided with Israel while others opposed the occupation. In the mornings in Qlayaa, home to a statue of Saint George, few people venture outside as the sound of bombardment echoes overhead. Pauline Matta, a mother of four children aged four to 18, said she broke down in tears when she saw Israel’s warning to evacuate. The 40-year-old is constantly on edge. 'I can't stand the sound of shelling or Israeli planes anymore. I scream whenever I hear them,' she said. Despite her fear, she cannot imagine leaving her home or how her family would survive elsewhere on her husband's modest army salary. 'This war was forced on us. We have nothing to do with it. Why should we leave?' she asked. 'I am determined to stay.'The post Christian Villagers Trapped in Crossfire in South Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/christian-villagers-trapped-crossfire-lebanon/	2024-10-11T05:17:34-07:00

Hezbollah senior leader Wafiq Safa has been critically injured and is in serious condition following Israeli airstrikes that hit two buildings in Beirut's Noueiri and Bourj Abi Haidar areas, sources told Sky News Arabia on Friday. According to Hezbollah's Al-Manar television and Israeli media, the airstrikes were intended to target Safa, a high-ranking security and political official within the group. Al-Manar reported that Safa was not present in either building during the attacks. The Israeli military has not commented on these reports.

Blinken: US Seeks Lebanon Solution, Not Broader Conflict	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed optimism on Friday for a diplomatic solution in Lebanon while emphasizing the importance of preventing a wider conflict in the region. He voiced support for Lebanon’s fragile government to strengthen its authority against Hezbollah. Blinken reiterated that Israel, which has been conducting deadly airstrikes on Lebanon, has 'a right to defend itself' against Hezbollah but also raised concerns about the humanitarian situation. Speaking after an East Asia Summit in Laos, Blinken said, 'We are actively engaging to prevent a broader conflict in the region.' He stressed the need to create conditions that would allow people to return to their homes safely, stating, 'Israel has a legitimate interest in ensuring the security of its citizens, and the people of Lebanon want the same security. We believe that the best way forward is through diplomatic negotiations, something we've been working on for a while and are focusing on now.' Blinken further highlighted the importance of supporting the Lebanese state as it seeks to strengthen its position, saying, 'It is clear that the people of Lebanon have a strong interest in the state asserting itself and taking responsibility for the country’s future.' He also addressed the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, voicing concerns about the limited aid reaching those in need. 'I am deeply concerned about the insufficient assistance getting to them,' Blinken said, adding that the U.S. has been 'very directly engaged with Israel' on this issue.The post Blinken: US Seeks Lebanon Solution, Not Broader Conflict first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-seeks-lebanon-solution-not-broader-conflict/	2024-10-11T05:17:12-07:00

Lebanon’s UN Ambassador Calls for Immediate Ceasefire, Israel Vow...	Lebanon's U.N. Ambassador, Hadi Hashem, has called for an immediate ceasefire, while Israel's envoy stated that military operations would continue until Hezbollah's influence in southern Lebanon is dismantled, preventing further attacks on Israel. During an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting convened by France, Hashem argued that Israel’s bombings and ground invasion would not bring security or stability for its people. He emphasized, 'Israel cannot return the displaced to their homes without a proper agreement.' Hashem affirmed Lebanon's commitment to a French-American initiative for a 21-day ceasefire, intended to resolve border disputes. However, he accused Israel of initially agreeing to the initiative before backtracking and intensifying its aggression. Israel’s U.N. Ambassador, Danny Danon, responded by saying Israeli forces are focused on weakening Hezbollah, preventing future attacks on Israel, and dismantling the terror network that spans southern Lebanon. Danon stressed that peace between Israel and Lebanon requires the removal of Hezbollah. He also called for the full implementation of the 2006 U.N. Security Council resolution that ended the last Israel-Hezbollah conflict. This resolution includes disarming all armed groups, including Hezbollah, and ensuring the Lebanese Army controls the entire southern region of the country.The post Lebanon’s UN Ambassador Calls for Immediate Ceasefire, Israel Vows to Continue Attacks first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lebanons-un-ambassador-ceasefire-israel-attacks/	2024-10-11T04:20:14-07:00	
Hezbollah Launches Drone Attack on Israeli Base in Haifa	Hezbollah announced on Friday that it had carried out a drone attack targeting a military base in Haifa, located in northern Israel. This action followed deadly airstrikes in central Beirut the previous day, as the group continues its clashes with Israeli forces along the border. In a statement, Hezbollah confirmed that it had launched 'an air attack using explosive-laden drones' directed at the 'air defense command base' in Haifa. The group described this attack as retaliation for Israeli strikes on 'cities, villages, and civilians.' Earlier, Hezbollah had also claimed responsibility for a rocket attack on Israeli forces in Zofolon, north of Haifa. According to Al-Arabiya television, 30 rockets were fired at Haifa and the Galilee region on Friday morning.The post Hezbollah Launches Drone Attack on Israeli Base in Haifa first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-launches-drone-attack-israeli-base-haifa/	2024-10-11T04:19:50-07:00	
Mikati: Blinken Reveals Major Push for Ceasefire	Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati on Friday called on the United Nations to pass a resolution demanding an 'immediate' ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. Mikati informed reporters that the Lebanese foreign ministry would request the U.N. Security Council to issue a resolution calling for a 'full and immediate ceasefire.' He also emphasized that his government remains committed to Resolution 1701, which was adopted in 2006 and mandates that only the Lebanese army and peacekeepers be stationed in the southern part of the country. Mikati further disclosed that he had a conversation with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. 'The discussion was focused on seriously pursuing a ceasefire, and we received full support for Lebanon,' he said. He emphasized the ongoing efforts to broker a ceasefire, adding, 'We are prepared to bolster our army's presence along the southern border, but the international community must pressure Israel to uphold Resolution 1701.' Mikati also stressed the importance of ending violence against civilians, stating, 'My appeal is for a ceasefire and an end to targeting civilians. Where is the humanity in this? We send out a cry of conscience to the world.' In response to a question regarding the deadly airstrikes in central Beirut on Thursday, Mikati noted that Israel had recently reduced the intensity of its airstrikes on Beirut’s southern suburbs due to international mediation efforts. In a separate statement, Mikati also called for the election of a new president who would be 'accepted by all Lebanese.'The post Mikati: Blinken Reveals Major Push for Ceasefire first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/blinken-reveals-major-push-ceasefire/	2024-10-11T04:19:12-07:00	
Breaking: Israel’s Deadliest Strike in Central Beirut Stuns Leban...	Rescue teams were sifting through the debris of a collapsed building in central Beirut on Friday morning, following two Israeli airstrikes that struck the Lebanese capital. The attack left at least 22 people dead and dozens injured. The airstrikes, which were the deadliest in central Beirut in over a year of conflict, targeted two residential buildings in neighborhoods now housing large numbers of displaced people fleeing Israeli bombardments from other parts of Lebanon. According to Hezbollah's Al-Manar TV and Israeli media, the strikes were aimed at Wafiq Safa, a high-ranking Hezbollah security official. However, Al-Manar reported that Safa was not present in either of the buildings. The Israeli military declined to comment on these reports. The strikes on Thursday night occurred as Israel ramped up its offensive against Hezbollah, launching heavy airstrikes across Lebanon and initiating a ground invasion along the border. The escalation follows more than a year of intermittent exchanges of fire between the two sides. In Beirut's Burj Abi Haidar neighborhood, civil defense teams and municipal workers were digging through the rubble of a three-story building that was destroyed by the strike. An adjacent building was also heavily damaged. Ahmad al-Khatib, who was in the damaged building with his wife, Marwa Hamdan, and their 2 ½-year-old daughter, Ayla, recounted the terrifying moment the blast hit. He had just picked up his wife from work, and she was praying when the explosion occurred. 'The world suddenly turned upside down, and everything went dark,' said the 42-year-old, tears streaming down his face. He managed to pull his daughter out from under the debris of a collapsed wall. His wife was thrown against a wall by the force of the explosion, suffering a head injury from a piece of metal. 'I looked at her and shouted, 'Say something!'' he recalled, but she could only respond with moans of pain. She is currently in intensive care at a Beirut hospital, while their daughter sustained minor injuries. Another resident, Mohammed Tarhani, had sought refuge with his brother in the same neighborhood after escaping airstrikes in southern Lebanon. His children were on the veranda when the explosion occurred. 'We rushed out to find the children,' he said. 'Where can we go now?' Civil defense official Walid Hashash stated that no more bodies are expected to be found in the rubble, as there are no missing people. He added that once the rescue operations are complete, a final death toll will be released.The post Breaking: Israel’s Deadliest Strike in Central Beirut Stuns Lebanese as They Dig Through Rubble first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israels-strike-central-beirut-stuns-lebanese/	2024-10-11T04:18:19-07:00	
Biden and Netanyahu Hold ‘Productive’ Talks on Retaliation Agains...	U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris had what the White House described as 'productive' discussions with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday, focusing on Israel's response to the recent missile attack by Iran. The White House issued a statement saying, 'This morning, President Biden spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel, and Vice President Harris joined the call.' It was mentioned that a detailed readout of the conversation would be released later. According to White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, the 30-minute call was described as 'direct,' 'honest,' and 'productive.' She added that the U.S. and Israeli governments had been in discussions since the missile attack by Iran last week, with those conversations continuing during the call between Biden and Netanyahu. Jean-Pierre noted that talks about Israel's potential response would continue but declined to provide further specifics until the official readout of the call was published. This call comes at a time of heightened tensions between Biden and Netanyahu and marked their first conversation since August 21, following a seven-week hiatus during which Israel also launched an offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon. President Biden has previously urged Israel not to target Iran's nuclear facilities or oil infrastructure, warning that such actions could spike oil prices just weeks before the U.S. presidential election. A new book by journalist Bob Woodward highlights the growing friction between the two leaders, with Biden reportedly telling Netanyahu in July that Israel's global image is increasingly viewed as 'a rogue state, a rogue actor,' according to a report by The New York Times.The post Biden and Netanyahu Hold ‘Productive’ Talks on Retaliation Against Iran first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/biden-netanyahu-productive-talks-retaliation-iran/	2024-10-10T01:42:29-07:00	
Gallant Vows ‘Lethal, Precise, and Surprising’ Strike on Iran	Israel's Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, issued a stern warning on Wednesday, stating that Israel’s response to a recent Iranian missile attack would be both 'lethal' and 'surprising.' In a speech to Israeli troops, Gallant emphasized, 'Our strike will be lethal, precise, and most importantly, unexpected. They won't understand what happened or how it occurred, but they will see the consequences. Whoever attacks us will suffer and pay the price.' This warning follows Iran's missile attack on Israel on October 1, which the United States assisted in defending against. U.S. President Joe Biden has made it clear that he would not support retaliatory strikes on sites connected to Iran's nuclear program.The post Gallant Vows ‘Lethal, Precise, and Surprising’ Strike on Iran first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/gallant-lethal-precise-surprising-strike-iran/	2024-10-10T01:05:54-07:00

US Warns Israel Against Repeating Gaza Destruction in Lebanon	The United States issued a warning to Israel on Wednesday, urging against carrying out military actions in Lebanon similar to those seen in Gaza, following a statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who threatened Lebanon with 'destruction' comparable to what occurred in Palestinian territories. Despite this, Israel's military chief, Herzi Halevi, promised to continue the heavy bombing campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon, which has resulted in over 1,200 deaths since September 23. He stated that the bombings would persist without giving Hezbollah any opportunity to recover. These developments followed a highly anticipated phone conversation between Netanyahu and U.S. President Joe Biden, their first discussion in seven weeks. The call, which lasted 30 minutes, was described by the White House as 'direct,' 'honest,' and 'productive.' Although the conversation's details were not immediately released, discussions were expected to center around Israel's response to last week's missile attacks by Iran. When questioned about the call, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris acknowledged its importance but declined to share specifics, stating that they were 'classified.' White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre confirmed that ongoing discussions with Israel on its military responses would continue. Meanwhile, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who was originally scheduled to visit Washington on Wednesday to discuss Israel's actions, had his trip postponed by Netanyahu. Gallant emphasized that Israel’s retaliation against Iran would be 'deadly, precise, and surprising.' Iran had launched approximately 200 missiles at Israel, claiming it was in retaliation for the deaths of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. Many of these missiles were intercepted by Israeli and allied air defenses. President Biden has advised Israel to avoid targeting Iran’s nuclear facilities, fearing significant retaliation, and has discouraged strikes on Iranian oil infrastructure, which could disrupt global oil prices. A source from the Lebanese government told AFP that Hezbollah had agreed to a ceasefire with Israel on September 27, following the Israeli strike that killed Nasrallah. However, Israel's subsequent actions derailed the ceasefire plans, which had U.S. and allied support. Since Nasrallah’s death, the Lebanese government reported no further communication with Hezbollah. Meanwhile, clashes between Hezbollah fighters and Israeli forces continued in southern Lebanon, with Hezbollah using rocket-propelled weapons to resist Israeli attempts to breach the border. In northern Israel, two people were killed by suspected Hezbollah rocket fire in Kiryat Shmona, and Israeli air defenses intercepted two projectiles aimed at the coastal town of Caesarea. Lebanese officials reported that an Israeli airstrike killed at least four people in the Chouf district, southeast of Beirut, an area that had previously been relatively untouched by Israel's intensified bombing. Israel's bombardment of Hezbollah positions in Lebanon, which began on September 23, has displaced more than a million people, according to AFP's count based on official statistics. Israeli ground troops entered Lebanon on September 30, with Israeli forces reporting the elimination of terrorists in close combat and aerial strikes over the past 24 hours, alongside the destruction of 100 Hezbollah targets. Since the ground offensive began, 13 Israeli soldiers have been confirmed dead, according to the Israeli military.The post US Warns Israel Against Repeating Gaza Destruction in Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-warns-israel-repeating-gaza-destruction-lebanon/	2024-10-10T01:05:35-07:00	
Lebanon Arrests Two Syrians Suspected of Spying for Israel	The Lebanese Army announced on Wednesday the arrest of two Syrians suspected of being recruited to spy for Israel, as Israel continues its military strikes on Hezbollah targets within Lebanon. According to a statement shared on social network X by Lebanese army intelligence, the two Syrians were apprehended for 'photographing various locations' and documenting the aftermath of Israeli airstrikes. The arrests were made as part of ongoing efforts to monitor and track down Israeli spy networks and agents within the country. The statement further explained that the two individuals had also recorded 'search and rescue operations and the recovery of bodies' at sites hit by Israeli airstrikes. The pair were reportedly recruited through social media, and the case is now under investigation by judicial authorities. Israel has been carrying out air raids in Lebanon for more than two weeks, targeting Hezbollah commanders and their munitions. These strikes, which began on September 23, have resulted in over 1,200 deaths, according to an AFP count based on official sources. Lebanon is still technically at war with Israel, and any contact or travel between Lebanese citizens and Israel is strictly prohibited. In recent weeks, tensions have heightened following Israeli strikes that killed several senior Hezbollah commanders, including their leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. Over the years, Lebanese security forces have arrested numerous individuals on suspicion of collaborating with Israel, with some receiving prison sentences of up to 25 years.The post Lebanon Arrests Two Syrians Suspected of Spying for Israel first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lebanon-arrests-two-syrians-spying-israel/	2024-10-10T01:05:23-07:00

Biden to Discuss Israel’s Iran Strike with Netanyahu	U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to have an important phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday morning regarding Israel's planned strikes on Iran, as reported by three U.S. officials to Axios. This call would be their first conversation in two months of tension and comes as Israel considers significant military action that could escalate the conflict in the region. On Tuesday night, Netanyahu met for several hours with senior ministers and heads of Israel's military and intelligence agencies to decide on the timing and scale of Israel's planned response, according to two Israeli officials. The retaliation is expected to be significant, potentially involving airstrikes on military sites in Iran and covert operations, like the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Israel is also considering targeting Iran's oil infrastructure, a move Biden has signaled he would oppose. An aide to Netanyahu informed Axios that, once a decision is made, Netanyahu would want to brief Biden. A U.S. official stated that Washington aims to 'use the call to try and shape the limitations of the Israeli retaliation.' The U.S. wants Israel to target significant sites without excessive force. The Biden-Netanyahu call is expected one week after Iran launched approximately 180 ballistic missiles at Israel. While most were intercepted, some caused minor damage to Israeli air bases, and a few landed near Mossad headquarters in Tel Aviv without causing any damage. The Iranian attack was in response to Israeli assassinations of key Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iranian officials. Tehran claimed it would not escalate further unless Israel attacked Iran again, while Israel vowed retaliation. U.S. and Israeli officials believe this cycle of retaliation will continue, with both countries coordinating closely to counter Iranian responses. Last Friday, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told Israel's Minister for Strategic Affairs, Ron Dermer, that the U.S. expects 'clarity and transparency' from Israel about its plans, given their implications for U.S. forces and interests in the region. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant was planning to travel to Washington on Tuesday, but the trip was blocked by Netanyahu, who insisted Gallant wait until Biden's call and approval from Israel's security cabinet for the attack plans. The upcoming call between Biden and Netanyahu was already arranged before the disagreement between Netanyahu and Gallant. According to U.S. officials, Biden and Netanyahu are also expected to discuss the ongoing conflicts in Lebanon and Gaza.The post Biden to Discuss Israel’s Iran Strike with Netanyahu first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/biden-discuss-israels-iran-strike-netanyahu/	2024-10-09T06:06:59-07:00	
Iran FM Heads to Saudi for Talks on Gaza and Lebanon	Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi will travel to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday for discussions about stopping Israeli attacks on Gaza and Lebanon, according to Iran's foreign ministry. Hamas and Hezbollah are both part of the Iran-backed 'Axis of Resistance' of militant groups in the region. Araghchi's visit to the Gulf kingdom is part of Iran's diplomatic efforts, coordinated with regional countries, ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei said on X (formerly Twitter). The visit aims to halt 'the Israeli regime's genocide and aggression' and reduce the suffering of people in Gaza and Lebanon, Baghaei added. Relations between predominantly Shia Iran and Sunni-majority Saudi Arabia were restored in March 2023 after a China-brokered deal ended a seven-year diplomatic rift. Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter and custodian of Islam's two holiest sites, suspended U.S.-led negotiations on normalizing relations with Israel after the onset of the Gaza conflict. Iran has repeatedly accused Israel, its longstanding rival, of committing genocide and war crimes since the beginning of the Gaza conflict. During a visit to Beirut on Friday, after the conflict spread to Lebanon, Araghchi expressed Iran's support for a 'simultaneous' ceasefire in Lebanon and the Palestinian territories. Iran also described Hamas's October 7, 2023, attack on Israel as 'a turning point in the history of the legitimate struggle of the Palestinian people against Israel.'The post Iran FM Heads to Saudi for Talks on Gaza and Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/iran-fm-heads-saudi-talks-gaza-lebanon/	2024-10-09T06:06:52-07:00	
Report: US Pushes for Comprehensive Peace in the Region	The United States is reportedly pursuing a 'comprehensive pacification' effort in the region, as revealed by Israel's Channel 12 in an unannounced move. These efforts are said to focus on achieving calm across all regional fronts, and, as of now, Israel is not actively involved in these discussions, according to the channel. Channel 12 cited senior Israeli officials who said they recently learned of talks between the United States, Arab countries, and Iran, involving a potential comprehensive ceasefire. This ceasefire would cover multiple conflicts, including the Israeli escalation in Lebanon and the support fronts launched by Houthi forces from Yemen and pro-Iran factions in Iraq. It remains unclear whether these efforts will also include the Gaza front. The report mentioned that 'Israel has not yet participated in these talks nor communicated its stance to the United States.' Senior Israeli officials were quoted as saying, 'Israel is currently in a position of strength,' and that any ceasefire would be on its terms, which would include the withdrawal of Hezbollah forces to north of the Litani River and the dismantling of all military facilities of the group in border areas. This news comes as Israel prepares to respond to the missile attack carried out by Iran on October 1, while reports indicate that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, after a long period of absence, is communicating with mediators to explore potential opportunities to restart negotiations.The post Report: US Pushes for Comprehensive Peace in the Region first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-pushes-comprehensive-peace-region/	2024-10-09T06:06:44-07:00

UN Coordinator, UNIFIL Chief Push for Negotiated Solution	U.N. Special Coordinator for Lebanon Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert and UNIFIL Head of Mission and Force Commander Lt. Gen. Aroldo Lázaro have advocated for a 'negotiated solution' to resolve the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. Reflecting on the year since the conflict's escalation, they noted, 'It's been a year since the daily exchanges of fire began across the Blue Line, starting with Hezbollah firing rockets into Shebaa Farms, in breach of the cessation of hostilities and Security Council resolution 1701 from 2006. This year has seen a tremendous loss of life, massive displacement, and severe devastation, leaving civilians on both sides in desperate need of security and stability.' They expressed disappointment that their continuous calls for restraint, protection of civilians, adherence to international humanitarian law, and the resumption of political processes as per resolution 1701 have been ignored. 'One year on, what began as near-daily exchanges of fire has intensified into a relentless military offensive, creating a humanitarian disaster of immense scale. With ongoing Israeli bombardments now a daily reality in Lebanon, and Hezbollah's continued rocket and missile attacks on Israel, the human cost is unspeakable, with countless killed or injured and hundreds of thousands displaced,' they stated. Plasschaert and Lázaro highlighted that every act of aggression only serves to further distance the parties from the peace envisioned in resolution 1701 and the conditions necessary for lasting civilian security on both sides of the Blue Line. They concluded by emphasizing that continued violence and destruction would not address the root issues or enhance safety in the long term. Instead, they stressed that negotiating a solution is the only way to achieve the security and stability that civilians from both sides urgently need and deserve, urging immediate action towards this end.The post UN Coordinator, UNIFIL Chief Push for Negotiated Solution first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/un-coordinator-unifil-push-negotiated-solution/	2024-10-08T06:35:39-07:00	
Breaking: Israeli Army Launches Operations Against Hezbollah in S...	On Tuesday, the Israeli military announced it had initiated precise strikes against Hezbollah targets in southwest Lebanon, further intensifying its ground operations along Lebanon's coastline after increasing troop deployment. According to an official statement on its Telegram channel, 'Yesterday (Monday), the 146th Division began limited, localized, targeted operational activities against Hezbollah terror targets and infrastructure in southwestern Lebanon.' This military action follows warnings issued by the Israeli military to the residents of over a dozen towns and villages in southwestern Lebanon to evacuate, including Naqoura, which houses U.N. peacekeepers. On Monday night, the Israeli army designated four areas in northwest Israel as 'closed military zones' following the advisory for evacuations along the nearby Lebanese coast. The areas identified were Rosh HaNikra, Shlomi, Hanita, and Arab al-Aramshe in northern Israel, with entry to these areas prohibited starting at 22:00 that day. Israel has urged evacuations from several dozen communities in southern Lebanon, most of which are north of the U.N.-declared buffer zone set up following the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. The objective of these Israeli operations is to stop a year-long barrage of Hezbollah rocket fire, allowing thousands of its northern residents to safely return home. Meanwhile, Hezbollah has declared it will continue its attacks until a ceasefire is achieved in Gaza. The conflict, which intensified in mid-September, has resulted in the displacement of over 1 million Lebanese.The post Breaking: Israeli Army Launches Operations Against Hezbollah in Southwest Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-army-operations-hezbollah-lebanon/	2024-10-08T06:35:01-07:00	
US Urges Israel to Spare Beirut Airport	The United States has cautioned Israel against targeting Beirut airport and the access roads leading to it amid ongoing intensive airstrikes in Beirut’s southern suburbs. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller emphasized the importance of keeping these routes open not only for Americans seeking to leave Lebanon but also for international citizens. On Monday, Israeli forces launched an airstrike near Beirut’s international airport, as reported by a security source to AFP. This comes during a time when the U.S. has been organizing near-daily charter flights to evacuate American citizens and their families due to the escalating conflict with the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah. According to Miller, around 900 people have utilized these flights, though none have reached full capacity yet. Additionally, the U.S. is reserving seats on still-operating commercial flights for those wishing to leave. Approximately 8,500 Americans have reached out to the State Department regarding departure options, although this number doesn't necessarily reflect those intending to leave. Miller chose not to comment on whether the Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon, specifically Beirut, adhere to international law, stating, 'I don’t have a characterization of them one way or the other,' but he noted that the expectation is for operations to target Hezbollah in compliance with international humanitarian law, aiming to minimize civilian casualties. The U.S. has occasionally criticized Israel for the high civilian death toll in Gaza, where over 41,000 fatalities have been reported over the past year, with President Joe Biden describing some of Israel’s actions as 'over the top.' However, the U.S. continues to support Israel’s broader military efforts. Israel’s recent military actions were triggered by a deadly attack from the Palestinian militant group Hamas on October 7, 2023, and have since extended from Gaza, where Hamas is based, to targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon. While the U.S. backs Israel’s offensive against Hezbollah, Miller expressed concerns about the potential for these operations to extend indefinitely, stating, 'We are very cognizant of the many times in the past where Israel has gone in on what looked like limited operations and has stayed for months or for years. And ultimately, that’s not the outcome that we want to see.'The post US Urges Israel to Spare Beirut Airport first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-urges-israel-spare-beirut-airport/	2024-10-08T05:47:19-07:00	
Hezbollah Vows to Spare Israeli Troops Near Peacekeepers	Hezbollah has instructed its fighters to refrain from attacking Israeli forces who have positioned themselves behind a U.N. peacekeeping base near the Lebanese border village of Maroun al-Ras. This directive was issued following a statement from UNIFIL, the U.N. peacekeeping operation, which labeled Israel’s nearby military activities as 'extremely dangerous' and a threat to their peacekeepers’ safety. UNIFIL had also noted that it had repeatedly communicated its concerns to Israel. The decision by Hezbollah was intended to protect the lives of U.N. peacekeepers, according to a statement from one of its field commanders. Hezbollah has accused Israel of using the U.N. forces as human shields in these operations. Despite suggestions from Israel that UNIFIL should relocate, the peacekeeping body confirmed on Saturday that it would maintain its positions along the border. Meanwhile, Israel has recently announced its intention to conduct limited ground operations into southern Lebanon. Over the past week, there have been several clashes and attempted infiltrations by Israeli troops near Maroun al-Ras, as reported by Hezbollah. Since September 23, Israel has escalated its military actions in Lebanon, resulting in over 1,110 deaths and displacing hundreds of thousands. These developments come amidst an already severe economic crisis in Lebanon. The deployment of the Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeepers in southern Lebanon was a key provision of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which was aimed at ending the 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.The post Hezbollah Vows to Spare Israeli Troops Near Peacekeepers first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-spare-israeli-troops-peacekeepers/	2024-10-08T05:46:53-07:00	
Qassem Backs Berri’s Ceasefire, Assures Hezbollah’s Strength	On Tuesday, Hezbollah's Deputy Chief Sheikh Naim Qassem declared that the group's military strength remains robust despite enduring weeks of intense Israeli airstrikes. During a televised speech, Qassem emphasized Hezbollah's resilience and operational successes, noting, 'Hundreds of rockets and dozens of drones have been launched, targeting numerous Israeli settlements and cities&#8230; I assure you that our capabilities are intact.' Qassem's statement came on the anniversary of intensified hostilities that escalated into a full-blown conflict last month. He confidently asserted that Hezbollah would continue to extend its rocket fire deeper into Israeli territory, resulting in further displacement of Israelis. He further highlighted that Hezbollah has effectively filled positions left by commanders who were casualties of recent Israeli airstrikes, stating, 'There are no vacant posts.' He mentioned that the organization would appoint a new leader to follow Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed last month in a strike on an underground base in south Beirut, though he acknowledged the challenges posed by the ongoing war. 'The organization and its leadership remain tightly structured&#8230; We have weathered severe setbacks,' Qassem remarked, reflecting on the losses sustained, including that of Nasrallah and other key figures since September 23. In his address, Qassem mourned the late secretary-general but expressed motivation from Nasrallah's resilience. Addressing the Israeli army chief directly, he predicted failure for the Israeli forces: 'The longer the war drags on, the greater Israel's predicament will become.' 'We are steadfast and, God willing, we will triumph&#8230; We will not plead for peace nor will we be the first to falter,' he continued, expressing confidence in defeating Israel and critiquing the Israeli military's inability to make significant ground advances in southern Lebanon. He described any territorial gains by Israel as inconsequential and expressed a readiness to engage the enemy, suggesting that Israeli losses could potentially hasten the end of the conflict. Furthermore, Qassem expressed support for political efforts aimed at achieving a ceasefire with Israel, led by Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, whom he referred to as the 'big brother' and in whom he places complete trust. Al-Arabiya television reported that Lebanese politicians interpret Qassem's remarks as effectively passing leadership responsibilities to Nabih Berri during these critical times.The post Qassem Backs Berri’s Ceasefire, Assures Hezbollah’s Strength first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/qassem-backs-berris-ceasefire-assures-hezbollahs-strength/	2024-10-08T05:46:29-07:00	
Hezbollah Launches 85 Rockets Over Haifa, Israel Hits Dahieh	On Tuesday, the Israeli military reported that around 85 projectiles were launched from Lebanon towards northern Israel, impacting areas including the Upper Galilee, Central Galilee, and Haifa Bay, coinciding with a televised address by Hezbollah's deputy chief, Naim Qassem. During this attack, a 70-year-old woman suffered moderate injuries from shrapnel, and Israeli media showcased footage showing light damage to structures in the vicinity of Haifa, a major coastal city. Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the barrage, describing it as a 'large rocket salvo' directed at Haifa and its northern suburbs. The group stated that the attack was a retaliatory measure against Israeli assaults on urban areas and civilians in Lebanon. In a related event, Israel conducted a severe airstrike on Haret Hreik, a southern suburb of Beirut.The post Hezbollah Launches 85 Rockets Over Haifa, Israel Hits Dahieh first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-launches-85-rockets-haifa/	2024-10-08T05:46:13-07:00	
US Trust in Israeli Govt. Fades as Official Denies Seeking War wi...	Recent weeks have seen the Biden administration grow 'increasingly distrustful' of the Israeli government's statements about its military and diplomatic strategies amid ongoing conflicts, according to reports from Axios based on information from four U.S. officials. The trust issues have been exacerbated by Israel's planned retaliation against Iran for a significant missile attack, necessitating coordination with the U.S. given potential ramifications for American forces and interests. While the U.S. is not opposed to Israel responding, it expects any actions to be proportionate. During a recent discussion, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan emphasized to Israel's minister for strategic affairs, Ron Dermer, the U.S.'s expectation for 'clarity and transparency' regarding Israel's retaliation plans. Sullivan conveyed that without clear communication, the U.S. might not automatically support Israel against further Iranian attacks, although U.S. officials acknowledge that America would likely aid Israel's defense if needed. The level of communication has been a point of contention, with the U.S. often caught off guard by Israeli military or intelligence actions. Examples include unnoted Israeli airstrikes in the Middle East and significant operations like the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, which occurred without prior U.S. knowledge. These actions followed assurances from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to President Joe Biden about progressing towards a ceasefire and hostage release with Hamas. Further strains were evident when U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin learned of the assassination of Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah just minutes before Israeli jets bombed targets in Beirut, viewing it as a breach of trust. Despite these tensions, discussions between the U.S. and Israel continue. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, speaking with Austin, mentioned that Israel had not yet finalized its plans for striking back at Iran. Gallant is scheduled to meet with U.S. officials in Washington to discuss the matter further. An Israeli official noted that while Israel recognizes U.S. concerns and welcomes their input, it will respond to the Iranian attack decisively, ensuring that its actions do not escalate into a broader conflict with Iran.The post US Trust in Israeli Govt.

Macron Urges Netanyahu: The Time for a Ceasefire Is Now	On the eve of the anniversary marking last year's Hamas attacks against Israel, French President Emmanuel Macron had a phone conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. During this call, Macron emphasized France's steadfast support for Israel's security and advocated for a ceasefire in the ongoing conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon, according to the French presidency. The discussion occurred amid tense relations, following Macron's recent public statements advocating for a halt to the provision of arms used in the Gaza conflict, stressing the need for a political resolution. Although Macron clarified that France was not supplying weapons itself, his comments had sparked a pointed response from Netanyahu the day prior. During their conversation, Macron and Netanyahu candidly addressed the current Middle Eastern conflicts, acknowledging their differing views but expressing a mutual desire for understanding. The French president reassured Netanyahu of France's dedication to Israel's security, mentioning the deployment of French military resources in response to recent Iranian attacks. The call highlighted ongoing tensions and the complex geopolitical landscape, with Israel actively engaged in military operations against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, and facing threats from Iran.The post Macron Urges Netanyahu: The Time for a Ceasefire Is Now first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/macron-netanyahu-time-ceasefire-now/	2024-10-07T03:26:33-07:00	
Hezbollah Bombs Israeli Troops in Maroun al-Ras as Israel Deploys...	Hezbollah launched an attack against Israeli troops in a southern Lebanese village on Monday, while the Israeli military has increased its presence in the region by deploying an additional division for operations in Lebanon. According to Hezbollah, they struck Israeli forces gathered in Maroun al-Ras park with a barrage of rockets. This followed their earlier strikes across northern Israel and other military locations along the border. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed the deployment of the 91st Division to southern Lebanon, marking the third division to engage in the ground offensive against Hezbollah. Continued Conflict on Anniversary Hezbollah also reaffirmed its commitment to continue fighting against what it calls Israeli 'aggression,' especially significant on the anniversary of the Hamas attack on October 7, which sparked the current conflict in Gaza. Despite the heavy toll on Lebanon, Hezbollah expressed steadfastness in its resistance against Israeli forces, labeling Israel as a malignancy that must be eradicated. Casualty Reports The IDF reported the death of a soldier on Lebanon’s northern frontier, underscoring the ongoing danger since the initiation of ground operations against Hezbollah last week. Master Sergeant Etay Azulay was identified as the soldier who was killed during combat. Concerns for UN Peacekeepers Tensions have also escalated near the U.N. peacekeeping bases, as the Israeli military begins establishing a forward operating base close to these locations, potentially endangering peacekeepers. Despite requests from the Israeli military, UNIFIL, tasked with overseeing Israeli withdrawal since the 1978 invasion, has refused to abandon some of its positions in anticipation of the Israeli ground incursion.The post Hezbollah Bombs Israeli Troops in Maroun al-Ras as Israel Deploys Third Division first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-bombs-israeli-troops-maroun-al-ras/	2024-10-07T03:26:20-07:00	
Hezbollah Strikes Base Near Haifa After Another Intense Night	Early on Monday, Hezbollah announced that it had attacked an Israeli military installation near Haifa, marking the third such assault on military positions in that area within a single day. According to a statement from the group, Hezbollah militants fired Fadi 1 rockets at the Carmel base south of Haifa late Sunday. This followed two previous strikes on another military site also located south of Haifa, which the group dedicated to their late leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed last month in an Israeli strike on Beirut's southern suburbs. In response to ongoing threats, the Israeli military issued a renewed call on Sunday night for civilians to evacuate parts of Beirut's southern suburbs, a Hezbollah stronghold that has been under intense bombardment since last month. Military spokesman Avichay Adraee delivered the evacuation warning via social media platform X, specifying the areas of Burj al-Barajneh and Hadath as imminent targets due to their proximity to Hezbollah facilities. Following the evacuation warnings, Beirut's southern skyline was again illuminated by airstrikes, intensifying after what was already the heaviest bombardment since the escalation of aerial attacks on September 23. An earlier airstrike on Sunday in the town of Qmatiyeh, southeast of Beirut, resulted in the deaths of six individuals, including three children, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. Over the weekend, more than 30 airstrikes were reported by Lebanon's state-run National News Agency, while Israeli forces noted that approximately 130 projectiles had been fired from Lebanon into Israeli territory. Residents of Beirut described the overwhelming and terrifying sounds of the conflict, with one labeling it 'a night of terror.' In a particularly tragic incident, an airstrike in the coastal village of Jiyyeh killed three sisters and their aunt. A neighbor stressed the civilian nature of the targeted home by pointing out the victims were all women. The recent surge in violence follows Israel's initiation of a limited ground operation in southern Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah following the killing of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and several senior leaders. This conflict represents the most severe fighting between Israel and Hezbollah since their month-long war in 2006. The ongoing hostilities have resulted in the deaths of at least 1,400 Lebanese, including civilians and Hezbollah combatants, and have displaced over 1.2 million people. Israel maintains that its objective is to eliminate Hezbollah's presence near its borders to allow for the safe return of Israeli citizens.The post Hezbollah Strikes Base Near Haifa After Another Intense Night first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-strikes-base-haifa-intense-night/	2024-10-07T03:26:04-07:00

Israelis, Fighting on Multiple Fronts, Commemorate One Year Since...	Israelis commemorated the one-year anniversary of the devastating October 7, 2023, Hamas attack with vigils and solemn events on Monday. This attack, which occurred during a significant Jewish holiday, was the deadliest in Israel's history, initiating the ongoing conflict in Gaza and severely impacting the national psyche. The unexpected nature of the attack eroded the public's trust in their leadership and military, leaving a lasting impact that continues to influence the region today. The repercussions are still felt as Israel not only contends with the ongoing conflict in Gaza but also faces a new confrontation with Hezbollah and an intensifying struggle with Iran, a supporter of both Hamas and Hezbollah. On the anniversary, Hamas continued its resistance, launching rockets that triggered air raid sirens as far as Tel Aviv and near the Gaza border. In Gaza, the heavy toll of the conflict is ever-present, with no formal commemoration planned due to the extensive destruction and displacement caused by the Israeli counterattacks. Across Israel, people gathered at various memorials and cemeteries, while the Israeli Knesset lowered its flags to half-staff. An official state ceremony, which was pre-recorded in Ofakim to minimize disruption, focused on acts of bravery and hope. However, dissatisfaction with the government's handling of the attack and ongoing frustration over unreturned hostages led to a separate gathering in Tel Aviv by the families of victims. The size of this event was significantly reduced due to restrictions on large assemblies, a consequence of the ongoing missile threats from Iran and Hezbollah. The grim reality persists for the many hostages still held, with continuous upheaval in border communities and widespread displacement. The conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon are ongoing, with Israeli actions under scrutiny from international courts and relentless global criticism. The war has inflicted severe casualties, displacing a large portion of Gaza's 2.3 million residents, exacerbating a humanitarian crisis marked by extensive hunger and leaving the region heavily damaged despite repeated attempts at negotiating ceasefires led by the U.S.The post Israelis, Fighting on Multiple Fronts, Commemorate One Year Since Oct. 7 first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israelis-multiple-fronts-commemorate-year-oct-7/	2024-10-07T03:25:23-07:00	
Thousands Rally Globally for Ceasefire Ahead of Gaza War Annivers...	On the eve of the first anniversary of the conflict between Israel and Hamas set for October 7, large-scale protests erupted globally over the weekend. Demonstrators in various cities worldwide called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon amid ongoing hostilities involving Israel, Hamas, Iran, and Hezbollah, the latter supported by Iran. According to data from Gaza's health ministry, validated as credible by the United Nations, Israel's counterattacks have resulted in over 41,000 deaths, predominantly among civilians. Israel has escalated its military activities, now including a ground invasion in Lebanon, in response to recent missile attacks from Iran, raising concerns about the conflict broadening into a larger war. Demonstrations were particularly notable in Washington, where over a thousand people rallied outside the White House, urging the U.S. government under President Joe Biden to halt military support and aid to Israel. A dramatic incident occurred during the protests when a man set his arm on fire, which was quickly extinguished by police and onlookers. Simultaneously, support for Palestine saw thousands rallying in cities across continents, including Europe, Africa, Australia, and the Americas, demanding an end to the hostilities in Gaza. Violence marked the protests in Rome, where clashes between young protesters and the police involved the hurling of bottles and firecrackers, prompting police retaliation with tear gas and water cannons. This confrontation resulted in injuries to a police officer and the detention of two protesters. In Berlin, authorities detained 26 individuals at a pro-Israeli event who were accused of hurling insults, with the event drawing around 650 attendees. London's 'National March for Palestine' was vocal with chants like 'stop bombing civilians' and 'hands off Lebanon,' reflecting the global outcry against the bombings. Lebanon’s Prime Minister Najib Mikati, amidst this turmoil, advocated for international pressure on Israel to cease fire, aligning with US and French efforts to negotiate a truce. His comments coincided with new Israeli airstrikes targeting Hezbollah in Beirut’s southern suburbs, which were followed by additional strikes later, intensifying the situation.The post Thousands Rally Globally for Ceasefire Ahead of Gaza War Anniversary first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/thousands-rally-ceasefire-gaza-war-anniversary/	2024-10-06T02:29:12-07:00

Israeli Military Official: 'Preparing Response' to Iranian Attack	An Israeli official reported to AFP that Israel's military is preparing a response to Iran's recent missile attack. The official, who remained unnamed due to restrictions on speaking publicly, did not specify what the response would entail. Haaretz, a left-leaning newspaper, has cited military sources saying that the response will be substantial. According to these sources, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) are planning a significant military strike against Iran, prompted by the missile barrage earlier in the week from Tehran. The paper also noted that further missile attacks from Iran might occur after Israel's retaliatory action. Iran had fired approximately 200 missiles towards Israel on October 1, marking its second direct assault in under six months. Israel's air defense systems intercepted most of these missiles, with only a few hitting military targets and causing minimal damage and no casualties. This missile launch by Iran was said to be in retaliation for the killing of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah by an Israeli airstrike in Beirut on September 27. Additionally, Iran linked this assault to the death of Ismail Haniyeh, a former leader of Hamas, who was killed in Tehran on July 31. Iran and Hamas have accused Israel of being behind Haniyeh's assassination, although Israel has not publicly acknowledged these claims.The post Israeli Military Official: 'Preparing Response' to Iranian Attack first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-military-official-preparing-response-iranian-attack/	2024-10-06T02:05:18-07:00	
Netanyahu Warns Israel Is Fighting on Seven Fronts	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that, almost a year following the Hamas attacks, Israel is currently engaged in conflicts across seven different fronts. In a recent video address, he outlined the various adversaries Israel is confronting, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, the Houthis in Yemen, militant groups in both the West Bank and the Shiite militias operating in Iraq and Syria, and Iran itself. Netanyahu highlighted Iran's recent action of launching over 200 ballistic missiles directly at Israel, accusing it of orchestrating the multi-front offensive. Netanyahu emphasized Israel's ongoing efforts to alter the strategic dynamics in the north with Lebanon, noting that Israel has conducted close to 9,000 strikes there since October 8, in response to around 1,500 attacks from Hezbollah, according to data from ACLED. He also defended Israel's actions in Gaza, citing the right to self-defense, and reaffirmed the nation's commitment to rescuing 101 hostages. He criticized French President Emmanuel Macron and other leaders who have called for arms embargoes against Israel, asserting that Israel will persist in its fight for national security and global peace. The conflict has been severe, with over 1,400 people killed by Israeli strikes in Lebanon in the past month and nearly 7,500 injured, as reported by Lebanon's health ministry.The post Netanyahu Warns Israel Is Fighting on Seven Fronts first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/netanyahu-warns-israel-fighting-seven-fronts/	2024-10-06T02:05:07-07:00	
Israeli Military Encircles Jabalya in Northern Gaza Amid Deadly S...	The Israeli military has reported that it has surrounded Jabalya in northern Gaza and is actively conducting operations in the region. In preparation for this ground operation, they executed several airstrikes targeting alleged weapons storage, underground facilities, terrorist cells, and military infrastructure in the area. According to a CNN journalist, these strikes focused mainly on eastern Jabalya and nearby Gaza City, lasting around 90 minutes. The Palestine Red Crescent Society reported that these strikes resulted in the deaths of two individuals and injured others, with one of the strikes impacting an apartment close to a UNRWA clinic in the Jabalya refugee camp. The Israeli military has stated its objective is to dismantle Hamas's infrastructure in the area due to detected activities aimed at restoring their operational capabilities. They have communicated their intention to continue these operations as necessary to meet their strategic goals. Back in May, CNN had covered the Israeli military's resumed operations in northern Gaza, following claims made in January that they had dismantled the command structure of Hamas there. Despite these efforts, there were indications that Hamas was attempting to regroup, casting doubt on the feasibility of Israel's aim to completely eliminate Hamas from Gaza. Recently, the Israeli military advised civilians in northern Gaza to evacuate, with a new evacuation map being published for the area. Avichay Adraee, the Arabic-speaking spokesperson for the Israeli military, mentioned the expansion of a 'humanitarian area' in Al-Mawasi that includes access routes, field hospitals established since the war began, and areas providing essential supplies like food, water, and medical resources. Journalists have reported that evacuations began late Saturday, with Palestinians moving towards Gaza City in response to the military warnings.The post Israeli Military Encircles Jabalya in Northern Gaza Amid Deadly Strikes first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-military-encircles-jabalya-northern-gaza/	2024-10-06T02:04:57-07:00	
Israeli Strike on Central Gaza Mosque Leaves 21 Dead, Death Toll ...	The number of casualties from an Israeli airstrike on a mosque in central Gaza has increased to 21, as reported by the local Civil Defense and a hospital situated close to the site. Video footage from CNN depicted the frantic efforts to extract bodies from the debris following the nocturnal strike on the mosque in Deir el Balah. Originally reported at 18, the death toll was later updated to 21 by sources from the Civil Defense and the Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, located directly opposite the mosque. In a desperate search for survivors amid the mosque's wreckage, civilians along with civil defense and hospital personnel scrambled in darkness, aided only by the light from their cellphones, as shown in the CNN video. The video captured distressing scenes where bodies lay strewn about, with rescuers calling out as they discovered each person. In one instance, a man is heard shouting, 'He’s alive, by God he’s alive,' as he attempts to aid a non-responsive victim on the ground. Rescue efforts included a group of men successfully extracting another man, barely alive, from beneath a heavy block, while another appeared to have been killed by the strike. Victims, visibly wounded and covered in dust, were hastily transported on blankets to the nearby hospital. The Israeli military acknowledged conducting the strike, describing it as 'precise' and aimed at a Hamas 'command and control' center that they claimed was located within the mosque complex.The post Israeli Strike on Central Gaza Mosque Leaves 21 Dead, Death Toll Rises first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strike-central-gaza-mosque-21-dead/	2024-10-06T02:04:48-07:00	
UAE Ships 40 Tons of Medical Aid to Lebanon	On Saturday, an aircraft from the United Arab Emirates carrying 40 tons of critical medical supplies landed in Lebanon, part of the UAE's campaign, 'UAE stands with Lebanon,' as confirmed by a Lebanese Ministry of Health official to CNN. The UAE's foreign ministry declared the start of its relief efforts to aid Lebanon on the same day. The ministry highlighted that this aid delivery underlines the UAE's dedication to humanitarian efforts and signifies the strong brotherly ties between the two nations, especially during challenging times. According to the UAE’s foreign ministry, this gesture is part of a broader commitment wherein the UAE will provide $100 million in aid to Lebanon. The ministry also expressed its concerns about the growing conflict in Lebanon and its potentially destabilizing effects on regional stability. This development follows the announcement by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday of nearly $157 million in U.S. humanitarian assistance intended to support those affected by the ongoing conflict in Lebanon and surrounding areas. Recent weeks have seen the displacement of up to one million individuals within Lebanon, triggered by intensified military actions by Israel against Hezbollah. This figure includes over 200,000 people, predominantly Lebanese and Syrians, who have sought refuge in Syria, as reported by the United Nations.The post UAE Ships 40 Tons of Medical Aid to Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/uae-ships-40-tons-medical-aid-lebanon/	2024-10-05T07:21:52-07:00	
Breaking: Hezbollah Loses Contact with Nasrallah’s Potential Succ...	Hezbollah is currently unable to establish contact with Hashem Safieddine, a key figure viewed as a potential successor to the recently deceased leader Hassan Nasrallah, a Lebanese security source reported to CNN. Safieddine has been unreachable following an Israeli airstrike in Beirut’s southern suburbs on Friday. Safieddine, who is Nasrallah's maternal cousin, was a prominent candidate for leadership, having previously headed Hezbollah’s executive council. Both he and Nasrallah studied together in Iran during the 1980s. In a statement last month, after attacks targeted Hezbollah's communication devices, Safieddine declared that his group would persist in its efforts 'until the end.' The United States has recognized Hezbollah as a foreign terrorist organization since 1997 and specifically designated Safieddine as a terrorist in 2017.The post Breaking: Hezbollah Loses Contact with Nasrallah’s Potential Successor first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-loses-contact-nasrallahs-potential-successor/	2024-10-05T07:21:44-07:00	
Breaking: Israel Kills Hamas Military Wing Leader in Lebanon Airs...	An Israeli airstrike near Tripoli, Lebanon's northernmost city, resulted in the death of a key figure from Hamas’ military faction. The Israel Defense Forces and the Shin Bet intelligence agency confirmed they targeted and killed Saeed Atallah Ali, a high-ranking Hamas operative in Lebanon. They accused him of conducting terrorist activities against Israeli interests and recruiting for Hamas within Lebanon. This incident marks a rare attack on Tripoli, a city that had not seen such military actions since the 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. Typically, Israeli strikes have concentrated on southern Lebanon and Hezbollah's bases around southern Beirut. Hamas acknowledged the loss of Atallah Ali, describing him as a prominent leader in their Al-Qassam Brigades' Lebanon operations. The attack, which Hamas labeled as a 'treacherous Zionist bombing,' also claimed the lives of Ali's wife and two daughters. It took place at their residence in the Beddawi refugee camp, situated on a hill roughly 5 kilometers northeast of Tripoli. Visuals from the site depicted significant damage to an apartment building, with debris around and sheets draped from a balcony, partially covering the destruction. This airstrike is part of the broader ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, which escalated from exchanges starting October 7, 2023. Additionally, Israel and Hezbollah have been engaged in consistent hostilities since the following day. Hezbollah has declared it will continue its operations against Israel until a ceasefire is reached in Gaza.The post Breaking: Israel Kills Hamas Military Wing Leader in Lebanon Airstrike first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-kills-hamas-military-wing-leader-airstrike/	2024-10-05T07:21:35-07:00	
Watch: Breaking: Israeli Military Vows 'Serious and Significant' ...	The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have announced they are preparing a robust response to the recent Iranian ballistic missile strike, which involved approximately 200 missiles, as reported by the Times of Israel last Saturday. The IDF has stated that this attack will not go unanswered and that it will have significant repercussions. In a detailed operation, the IDF's Commando Brigade and the elite Yaholam Unit took decisive action against Hezbollah by destroying several tunnel shafts that were reportedly being used by militants to approach the Israeli border from southern Lebanon. This operation also targeted underground weapon caches, observation points, and rocket launching pads located in southern Lebanese villages. In these intense military activities, the IDF claims to have eliminated dozens of Hezbollah militants through coordinated airstrikes and on-ground engagements. To date, the Israeli military asserts that it has killed over 400 Hezbollah operatives during its ground operations in the region. These operations are described by the IDF as precise and focused, aimed at significantly disrupting Hezbollah's infrastructure along the border. The main objective is to demolish strategic assets within villages close to Israel to ensure the safety of northern Israeli residents and facilitate their return. Additionally, the Israeli forces have concentrated their efforts on what they identify as Hezbollah's strategic strongholds in southern Lebanon, where they have discovered extensive weapon stockpiles. One notable action included an IDF drone strike on a Hezbollah command center located within a mosque at the Martyr Salah Ghandour Hospital compound in the town of Bint Jbeil, southern Lebanon. The IDF highlighted that this strike was executed with precision, based on reliable intelligence.The post Watch: Breaking: Israeli Military Vows 'Serious and Significant' Response to Iran’s Missile Attack first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-military-serious-significant-response-iran/	2024-10-05T05:16:30-07:00	
UN Reports Over 200,000 Flee Lebanon Into Syria	Over 200,000 individuals have crossed from Lebanon into Syria, fleeing the Israeli bombardments, according to Filippo Grandi, the United Nations' High Commissioner for Refugees. This number includes both Lebanese and Syrians who had been residing in Lebanon. Grandi highlighted that humanitarian efforts to aid these displaced persons are underway at border checkpoints, coordinated by the UN and organizations like the Syrian Red Crescent. In the broader scope of the crisis, Lebanese officials report that the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has displaced over 1.2 million people within Lebanon itself, forcing many to live in precarious conditions on the streets. Additionally, Giacomo Lapo Baldini, Lebanon’s country director for Relief International, recently shared with CNN that the destruction has severely impacted access to clean water, as Israeli strikes have damaged water facilities.The post UN Reports Over 200,000 Flee Lebanon Into Syria first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/over-200000-flee-lebanon-into-syria/	2024-10-05T05:15:32-07:00

Hezbollah Clashes with Troops at Border as Israeli Airstrikes Pou...	Hezbollah declared on Saturday that its militants were actively engaging Israeli forces in southern Lebanon, highlighting a severe escalation in the conflict. This announcement follows Israel's intensified bombing across Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah strongholds as ground operations intensify near the Lebanese border, marking a significant escalation from previous cross-border exchanges to outright warfare. The latest Israeli airstrikes targeted the northern Tripoli region, hitting the Beddawi refugee camp and killing a Hamas commander and his family. This event underscores the broadening scope of the conflict, which now includes direct strikes in regions previously untouched by the current spate of violence. In Beirut, displaced individuals like Ibrahim Nazzal lament the destruction and express a desire to return to their lands despite the devastation. The conflict has escalated following Iran's unprecedented missile attack on Israel, coupled with ongoing Hezbollah rocket attacks and regional support from Iran's allies. This week's events mark a critical juncture, coinciding with the first anniversary of the significant Hamas attack on Israel on October 7. The situation in Beirut is dire, with airstrikes causing significant damage and civilian casualties, including the recent killing of more than 1,000 people by Israeli actions since September 23. On the ground, Hezbollah has reported that its fighters clashed with Israeli troops after repelling an earlier advance, while Israel claims to have eliminated a substantial number of Hezbollah militants. The conflict has had a significant humanitarian impact, prompting widespread displacement and severe damage to infrastructure, including hospitals. Lebanon's emergency response capabilities are stretched thin, with several medical facilities knocked out of operation and a crucial aid shipment recently arriving in Beirut. This ongoing conflict has drawn international concern, with various global actors urging restraint and a move towards diplomatic resolutions. However, the situation remains volatile, with significant military actions continuing and no clear resolution in sight.The post Hezbollah Clashes with Troops at Border as Israeli Airstrikes Pound Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-clashes-border-israeli-airstrikes-lebanon/	2024-10-05T04:46:59-07:00	
US Delivers Humanitarian Aid to Lebanon	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that the United States will deliver almost $157 million in additional humanitarian aid to support communities affected by conflict in Lebanon and the surrounding region. Blinken detailed that this assistance would benefit internally displaced persons and refugees within Lebanon, as well as those escaping to neighboring Syria. He explained that the American people are providing this vital support, which includes approximately $82 million managed by the Department of State’s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration and another $75 million through the United States Agency for International Development’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance. USAID has already allocated $11.5 million and is coordinating with Congress to release an additional $63.5 million soon to ensure ongoing support to the most vulnerable groups. This aid, comprising emergency food supplies, shelter, blankets, hygiene products, as well as water and sanitation services, aims to provide essential relief to those facing severe hardships, Blinken remarked. Over the past year, the U.S. has contributed nearly $386 million to assist those in Lebanon and Syria affected by escalating conflicts. Blinken highlighted the dire humanitarian crisis in Lebanon, which has displaced over a million people, and reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to supporting the region's most vulnerable. He also called on other donors to increase their contributions to meet the growing humanitarian needs.The post US Delivers Humanitarian Aid to Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-delivers-humanitarian-aid-lebanon/	2024-10-05T04:46:47-07:00	
Israeli Strike on al-Beddawi Camp Kills Hamas Official	An Israeli airstrike recently targeted the al-Beddawi refugee camp in northern Lebanon, resulting in the deaths of a Hamas official and his family. Hamas stated that the strike killed Saeed Atallah Ali, a member of its military faction, the Qassam Brigades, along with his wife Shaymaa Azzam, and their two daughters, Zeinab and Fatima. The camp, located near Tripoli, had not been hit in the ongoing conflict until this incident. This attack is part of a broader pattern of strikes targeting Hamas officials in Lebanon since the conflict between Israel and Hamas escalated in October 2023.The post Israeli Strike on al-Beddawi Camp Kills Hamas Official first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strike-beddawi-kills-hamas-official/	2024-10-05T04:46:38-07:00	
Volunteers Brave Danger to Rescue Pets from Bombed-Out Dahieh	Following the intense Israeli bombardment in Lebanon, many residents were forced to flee their homes quickly, leaving behind their pets in the chaos. Maggie Shaarawi, vice president of Animals Lebanon, has stepped in to help these animals. Due to the stressful environment, many cats hide and are left behind as their owners escape the danger. Shaarawi, along with her team, recently entered a heavily damaged neighborhood in Beirut's southern suburbs to rescue eight cats for a distressed owner who guided them via video call to the location of her cats in her living room. The team successfully located and rescued all the cats, narrowly escaping further destruction in the area, which was subsequently hit by another airstrike. This close encounter with danger highlighted the perilous nature of their mission. The escalation of airstrikes by Israel since September 23 has had devastating effects, killing over 1,000 people and displacing more than a million, according to Lebanese sources. Despite the risks, many residents have managed to bring their pets with them as they evacuate, but others, too attached to leave their animals behind, have chosen to stay despite the dangers. Shaarawi mentioned that so far, her team has managed to save around 120 animals from the Beirut suburbs and an additional 60 from the south. Despite a dangerous encounter with an airstrike, they continued their rescue efforts the following day. The rescue missions are tense and urgent, with animals, especially cats, becoming extremely agitated and fearful, resembling tigers in their frightened state. The team uses mopeds to quickly enter and exit the bombarded areas. Shaarawi described the war as traumatizing for both the animals and their human companions, who are subjected to daily bombings without understanding what is happening around them. They simply wait for their owners' return. Unfortunately, not all rescue missions are successful. In one heartbreaking instance, the team discovered one cat deceased and could not locate two others, presumed dead under the rubble of a destroyed house. The ongoing conflict continues to pose severe risks to both human and animal lives in the region.The post Volunteers Brave Danger to Rescue Pets from Bombed-Out Dahieh first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/volunteers-danger-rescue-pets-dahieh/	2024-10-05T04:46:13-07:00	
Four Lebanese Hospitals Halt Services as Israeli Bombing Intensif...	In recent times, multiple hospitals in Lebanon have been compelled to cease operations due to the ongoing Israeli bombardment. The cease in operations includes four hospitals, notably after Hezbollah-affiliated emergency personnel reported 11 casualties from Israeli strikes in southern Lebanon. Amidst these escalations, Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati has called upon the global community to influence Israel to facilitate access for rescue and medical teams to the sites of bombardments. He highlighted the severe impact on emergency teams, noting the deaths of many emergency workers recently. One such affected facility, Sainte Therese Hospital in Beirut’s southern suburbs, experienced severe damage from nearby Israeli airstrikes, leading to a suspension of all hospital services. Similarly, Mays al-Jabal hospital, located at the Israel-Lebanon border, ceased operations due to direct targeting and logistical challenges affecting supplies and staff movements. In an alarming incident reported by Mouenes Kalakesh, the director of Marjayoun governmental hospital, Israeli airstrikes targeted ambulances at the hospital’s entrance, resulting in fatalities among paramedics and forcing the hospital's closure. The Islamic Health Committee also reported the deaths of several emergency workers in Marjayoun and other locations due to direct strikes. Further complicating the situation, the Israeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee accused Hezbollah of exploiting ambulances for military purposes, warning that such vehicles could be targeted if found transporting combatants or military gear. Additional strikes were reported on the Salah Ghandour hospital in Bint Jbeil, leading to casualties among the medical staff and the evacuation of the facility. This ongoing conflict, which has seen nearly daily exchanges of fire across the Lebanon-Israel border, has significantly escalated since September 23, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis with over 1,110 people killed and up to a million displaced, as per official figures.The post Four Lebanese Hospitals Halt Services as Israeli Bombing Intensifies first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/four-lebanese-hospitals-halt-services-israeli-bombing/	2024-10-05T04:46:05-07:00	
State Department: Duration of Israel’s Ground Incursions in Leban...	The U.S. has engaged in talks with Israel regarding the aftermath of its military operations in Lebanon, though the duration of these activities remains uncertain, the State Department disclosed. State Department spokesperson Matt Miller expressed uncertainty about the future developments. 'I'm not going to prejudge what's going to happen. We don’t know what’s going to happen. Dare I say, the Israelis probably don’t know what’s going to happen at this point,' Miller stated. He emphasized that the U.S. would continue to monitor the situation closely and assess it as it evolves. Miller declined to comment on whether Israel has a definitive strategy for ending the conflict in the north, which has seen increased incursions and strikes in Beirut targeting Hezbollah. 'The Israelis will have to speak to that question, not me,' he remarked. Despite the lack of clear information from U.S. officials regarding the specifics of Israel’s military strategy against Hezbollah, Miller affirmed strong U.S. support for Israel’s targeted actions against the militant group’s infrastructure. He highlighted the U.S. desire for a diplomatic solution while also supporting efforts to weaken Hezbollah’s military capabilities.The post State Department: Duration of Israel’s Ground Incursions in Lebanon Uncertain first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/duration-israels-ground-incursions-uncertain/	2024-10-03T23:52:36-07:00	
Israeli Military Reports 20 Projectiles Fired from Lebanon into I...	The Israeli military reported that after sirens alerted the northern regions of Haifa and Galilee, nearly two dozen projectiles were launched from Lebanon into Israel. A Reuters video captured the moment these rockets were intercepted by Israel's defense systems above Haifa early Friday morning. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) detailed that around 20 projectiles were detected following the sirens, which went off between 7:01 a.m. and 7:04 a.m. local time in the Haifa Bay and Western Galilee regions. Most of these were successfully neutralized by the defense systems, while the remainder landed in unpopulated areas. Israel Police noted that fragments from the interceptions landed mainly in Kiryat Yam, located just north of Haifa, causing some property damage but no injuries were reported. Additionally, at 7:23 a.m. local time, sirens in the Upper Galilee area signaled the crossing of 'multiple projectiles' from Lebanon. The military confirmed that some were intercepted and others fell in open areas, though the full impact of this event remains uncertain.The post Israeli Military Reports 20 Projectiles Fired from Lebanon into Israel first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-military-20-projectiles-fired-from-lebanon-israel/	2024-10-03T23:52:23-07:00	
Hezbollah Leader Agreed to Ceasefire Days Before Assassination	Lebanon's Foreign Minister, Abdallah Bou Habib, revealed to CNN's Christiane Amanpour that just days before his assassination, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah had consented to a 21-day ceasefire. This truce was advocated by U.S. President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, and other international allies during the recent UN General Assembly. Habib confirmed Nasrallah's agreement in the interview, noting that Lebanon, after consultations with Hezbollah and Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berri, had aligned with the ceasefire. He added that both the U.S. and French governments were informed of this agreement, which was also supposedly affirmed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as per the joint statement by Presidents Biden and Macron. The plan was for White House senior adviser Amos Hochstein to travel to Lebanon to negotiate the details of the ceasefire. However, Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut's southern suburbs shortly thereafter. This announcement came just a day after a joint statement by several countries, including the United States, France, and others, calling for a 21-day ceasefire to enable diplomatic efforts and prevent further escalations. Sources close to the negotiations indicated that Hezbollah had agreed to the ceasefire shortly before the U.S. proposal was made public. It was suggested that such an agreement would have required Nasrallah's approval, although it was not confirmed if the decision came directly from him. Conversely, a Biden administration official expressed that they had no prior knowledge of Nasrallah's personal agreement to the ceasefire. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller echoed this sentiment, stating that while diplomatic talks were ongoing about the ceasefire proposal, the U.S. had not been informed of Hezbollah's consent. Hezbollah did not make any public declaration about their stance on the ceasefire. It seemed they were awaiting Israel's response to the international call for a ceasefire issued by the U.S., France, and other allies. Despite the agreement, the ceasefire was short-lived. Netanyahu soon declared that Israel would persist in its aggressive actions against Hezbollah. This discrepancy was later described by Israeli officials as a misunderstanding, believing the ceasefire proposal was merely the beginning of a process towards peace. Following these events, the U.S. refrained from further advocating for the ceasefire once it became apparent that Israel might target Nasrallah. In light of queries regarding the diminishing influence of the United States in the region, Habib emphasized the critical role of the U.S. in achieving a ceasefire, though he remained uncertain about the extent of support Lebanon could expect.The post Hezbollah Leader Agreed to Ceasefire Days Before Assassination first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-leader-agreed-ceasefire-days-before-assassination/	2024-10-03T23:52:08-07:00

Intense Israeli Airstrikes Hit Dahieh, Reportedly Targeting Safie...	Sources familiar with Hezbollah revealed that Israel executed 11 back-to-back airstrikes on the organization's stronghold in southern Beirut late Thursday. This marked one of the most intense bombardments since Israel escalated its offensive last week. According to three Israeli officials cited by Axios, these attacks aimed at eliminating Hezbollah's senior leader, Sayyed Hashem Safieddine. Loud explosions during these raids triggered car alarms and shook buildings across the Lebanese capital, as reported by AFP correspondents. The aftermath was visually captured with footage displaying massive fireballs and dense smoke at the strike site, while flares illuminated the area. Lebanon's National News Agency (NNA) confirmed that this sequence of over ten airstrikes constituted one of the fiercest assaults on Beirut's southern suburbs since the conflict's onset. The impact of these strikes reverberated into the surrounding mountainous regions, added the NNA. Earlier that day, the Israeli army’s Arabic-language spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, issued a critical evacuation warning to residents near the Bourj al-Barajneh area of south Beirut, hinting at imminent military actions due to the proximity of Hezbollah facilities. Further details emerged about another airstrike targeting a warehouse near Beirut airport earlier in the evening, which a Hezbollah-related source discussed with AFP. However, the contents of the warehouse remain unspecified. Reports by the NNA earlier in the day described several 'enemy raids,' with one source mentioning that these earlier strikes aimed at a building used by Hezbollah's media relations, which had been evacuated beforehand. This recent escalation follows Israel's announcement of ground operations in southern Lebanon, subsequent to prolonged aerial bombardments targeting Hezbollah areas throughout Lebanon. This military shift has led to significant casualties, with the conflict claiming over 1,000 lives and displacing hundreds of thousands. This series of events escalated further with the assassination of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah in south Beirut, significantly impacting the densely populated region.The post Intense Israeli Airstrikes Hit Dahieh, Reportedly Targeting Safieddine first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-airstrikes-hit-dahieh-targeting-safieddine/	2024-10-03T23:50:52-07:00	
Eight Israeli Soldiers Killed in Lebanon as Clashes with Hezbolla...	The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) disclosed on Wednesday, October 2, that eight soldiers had been killed during their ongoing ground operations against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, marking the first deaths in this phase of their campaign. The IDF released the names of the deceased soldiers, identifying them as follows: 1. Captain Eitan Itzhak Oster, 22, a team commander in the Egoz Commando Unit, from Modi’in. 2. Captain Harel Etinger, 23, a team commander in the Egoz Commando Unit, from Eli. 3. Captain Itai Ariel Giat, 23, from the Yahalom Combat Engineering Unit, residing in Shoham. 4.

Sergeant First Class Nazar Itkin, 21, of the Egoz Commando Unit, from Kiryat Ata. 7. Staff Sergeant Almken Terefe, 21, of the Golani Brigade’s reconnaissance unit, from Jerusalem. 8. Staff Sergeant Ido Broyer, 21, of the Golani Brigade’s reconnaissance unit, from Nes Tziona. The IDF reported that the six commandos from the Egoz unit lost their lives in a firefight with Hezbollah fighters in a village in southern Lebanon. Additionally, the aftermath of this encounter also saw an officer and four soldiers sustain severe injuries. During the operation to evacuate the injured, IDF troops were targeted by mortar fire from Hezbollah, resulting in further casualties. In a separate incident, two soldiers from the Golani reconnaissance unit were killed. Hezbollah claimed it had destroyed three Israeli Merkava tanks on the same day as they moved toward the Lebanese village of Maroun al-Ras, near the border.The post Eight Israeli Soldiers Killed in Lebanon as Clashes with Hezbollah Escalate first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/eight-israeli-soldiers-killed-lebanon/	2024-10-03T03:39:11-07:00
