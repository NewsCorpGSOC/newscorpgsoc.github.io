Israel Blames ‘Discipline Lapse’ in Death of Archaeologist Crossi...	The Israeli military has attributed the death of a 70-year-old archaeologist and another soldier in southern Lebanon to 'operational burnout' and a 'weakening of discipline and safety' during a visit to a combat zone in November. Zeev Erlich, who was not on active duty at the time, was wearing a military uniform and carrying a weapon when he was shot. Although he was not actively serving, the army classified him as a reservist with the rank of major and referred to him as a 'fallen soldier.' Erlich was a well-known figure in the West Bank, recognized for his work in Jewish history. Reports suggested that he had entered Lebanon to explore an archaeological site. The family of the soldier killed alongside him has expressed frustration over the circumstances surrounding his death. Following the incident, the Israeli military launched an investigation, with a separate inquiry focusing on how Erlich was permitted to enter the combat zone. While the military stressed that the entry of civilians, who are not military contractors or journalists, into such areas is rare, there have been previous reports of Israeli civilians, particularly those in favor of a permanent Israeli presence in Gaza or Lebanon, accessing these regions.The post Israel Blames ‘Discipline Lapse’ in Death of Archaeologist Crossing into Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-discipline-lapse-death-archaeologist/	2025-01-01T07:00:07-08:00	
Iran Set for Nuclear Talks with Europe on January 13	Iran is scheduled to engage in nuclear discussions with France, Britain, and Germany on January 13 in Geneva, Switzerland, as reported by local media. Kazem Gharibabadi, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister for Legal and International Affairs, confirmed that these meetings are intended as 'consultations, not negotiations.' This upcoming round of talks follows a November 2024 meeting where tensions escalated after a European-backed resolution accused Iran of inadequate cooperation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog. In response, Tehran announced plans to install additional uranium-enriching centrifuges at its enrichment facilities. The United Nations' nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, has expressed concern over Iran's accelerated uranium enrichment, noting that Iran is 'dramatically' increasing its enrichment levels to up to 60% purity, which is closer to the approximately 90% purity required for weapons-grade uranium. In 2018, the United States withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement under President Donald Trump and reimposed stringent sanctions on Iran. This action prompted Tehran to violate the agreement's nuclear limits, including rebuilding stockpiles of enriched uranium, refining it to higher fissile purity, and installing advanced centrifuges to expedite production. Indirect talks between the Biden administration and Tehran to revive the pact have been unsuccessful. President Trump has indicated a willingness to negotiate, stating during his election campaign in September: 'We have to make a deal, because the consequences are impossible. We have to make a deal.' As the January 13 talks approach, the international community remains attentive to Iran's nuclear activities and its engagement with European powers, with hopes for a resolution that addresses proliferation concerns and regional stability.

Israel Strikes Hezbollah Arms Transfer in Southern Lebanon	The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have conducted airstrikes in southern Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah operatives involved in transferring weapons. The IDF released footage showing Hezbollah members moving arms in the region prior to the strikes. This action is part of Israel's ongoing efforts to enforce ceasefire agreements and prevent the smuggling of arms to Hezbollah. The IDF has previously targeted Hezbollah's weapon smuggling routes in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, aiming to disrupt arms transfers from Syria. The situation in southern Lebanon remains tense, with both Israel and Hezbollah accusing each other of ceasefire violations. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) has expressed concerns over the ongoing hostilities, urging both parties to adhere to the ceasefire and avoid further escalation. The IDF's recent actions underscore the complexities of maintaining peace in the region, highlighting the challenges in monitoring and enforcing ceasefire agreements. The international community continues to call for restraint and dialogue to prevent further violence and instability.The post Israel Strikes Hezbollah Arms Transfer in Southern Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-strikes-hezbollah-arms-transfer/	2025-01-01T06:59:51-08:00	
10 Dead, 30 Injured in New Orleans Vehicle Attack	A man with a clear intent to cause widespread destruction drove a pickup truck at high speed into a crowd of people celebrating New Year's Eve in New Orleans, leading to at least ten fatalities and leaving over 35 others injured. The incident took place around 3:15 am local time in the city's lively French Quarter, which was filled with revelers welcoming 2025. Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick stated that the driver appeared determined to run over as many people as possible. Additionally, the driver shot at police officers, injuring two of them, and was intent on causing as much harm as he could. The whereabouts and condition of the driver remain unknown at this time. While the attack is not officially categorized as a terrorist act, Superintendent Kirkpatrick emphasized the truck’s high speed and the deliberate nature of the incident. The FBI will now lead the investigation into the event. Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry described the attack as a 'horrific act of violence.' Eyewitnesses told CBS News that the truck drove through the crowd before the driver got out and began shooting at police officers. Witnesses Jim and Nicole Mowrer described seeing a white truck break through a barricade at high speed. Nicole Mowrer recounted hearing gunfire and seeing police rush toward the scene. After the shooting stopped, they stayed in a safe spot until it was secure, and when they emerged, they saw several victims who had been struck and tried to help them. The attack occurred just before New Orleans was set to host the Sugar Bowl, a major football game between the University of Georgia and Notre Dame. Despite heightened police presence in anticipation of large crowds for the celebrations, the city was rocked by the tragedy.The post 10 Dead, 30 Injured in New Orleans Vehicle Attack first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/10-dead-30-injured-new-orleans-vehicle-attack/	2025-01-01T06:59:40-08:00	
French Ministers Visit Lebanon for Talks Amid Israel-Hezbollah Tr...	France's Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot and Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu arrived in Lebanon on Monday, marking their visit after a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah brought an end to the intense fighting that had plagued the region since late November. During their visit, Barrot and Lecornu met with Lebanese army chief Joseph Aoun. The following day, they are scheduled to visit U.N. peacekeepers stationed near the Israeli border. According to a statement from the Lebanese army on social media, the discussions between Aoun and the French officials focused on strengthening cooperation between the two countries' armies and continuing support for the Lebanese army in light of the ongoing situation. Aoun, who is considered a potential candidate for Lebanon’s presidency, has been responsible for deploying troops in southern Lebanon since the ceasefire took effect on November 27. Lecornu stated on social media that he is also set to meet with a French general involved in the ceasefire monitoring mechanism. He emphasized France's ongoing commitment to the stability of Lebanon and the broader region. This monitoring body includes representatives from Lebanon, Israel, the United States, France, and the U.N.'s UNIFIL peacekeeping mission, and is tasked with overseeing the ceasefire's implementation and addressing any violations. The UNIFIL peacekeeping force expressed concern on Thursday over the ongoing destruction in southern Lebanon by the Israeli army, despite the ceasefire being in place. On Tuesday, Lecornu and Barrot are expected to meet with French troops serving in the UNIFIL mission in southern Lebanon.The post French Ministers Visit Lebanon for Talks Amid Israel-Hezbollah Truce first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/french-ministers-lebanon-talks-truce/	2024-12-31T09:57:56-08:00	
Hezbollah Warns Israel: Leave South Lebanon After 60 Days	Mahmoud Qmati, the deputy head of Hezbollah's political council, has issued a warning that Hezbollah will change its approach towards Israeli soldiers if they remain in Lebanon for more than 60 days, which marks the initial phase of a ceasefire agreed upon in late November. Qmati explained that Hezbollah has committed to a period of patience for 60 days, but after this time, Israeli forces will be viewed as occupying troops, and Hezbollah will take appropriate action. The ceasefire agreement, brokered by France and the United States, outlines a gradual withdrawal of both Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters from southern Lebanon over the 60-day period. However, since the ceasefire began, Israel has continued to carry out occasional airstrikes in Lebanon, and its troops have advanced instead of retreating, bulldozing villages and detonating explosives along the border. Qmati emphasized that there are red lines, including issues related to Hezbollah’s weapons and the funding for reconstruction efforts. He accused certain domestic figures of acting in Israel's interests and stressed that Hezbollah does not want aid tied to conditions that would undermine its resistance. He further warned that France and the U.S. must understand that Hezbollah will not tolerate violations of these red lines, and they are prepared to take any necessary action. He reiterated that Hezbollah would not accept the occupation of Lebanon's land. Hezbollah has been patient so far for the sake of its people and in keeping with its commitment to the mediators. However, Qmati made it clear that after the 60-day period, on day 61, Hezbollah will treat Israeli forces as occupiers and respond accordingly. He also stated that Hezbollah's resistance capabilities remain strong and that the group is not bound by the ceasefire if Israel does not fully honor it. He indicated that either both sides must commit to the ceasefire, or neither will. Qmati added that many supporters and residents who have returned to villages in southern Lebanon are now calling on Hezbollah to take action in response to Israeli violations. He noted that the patience displayed by Hezbollah so far was for the benefit of these people, but now they are demanding retaliation.The post Hezbollah Warns Israel: Leave South Lebanon After 60 Days first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-warns-israel-leave-south-lebanon-60-days/	2024-12-31T09:57:49-08:00	
Syria’s Leader: Elections Could Take Up to 4 Years	Syria's current de facto leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, stated that it could take up to four years to organize elections in Syria. He also plans to disband his Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which has led the insurgency and is now overseeing the new authority in the country. Al-Sharaa shared these insights during an interview with Saudi television channel Al-Arabiya, nearly a month after HTS successfully overthrew President Bashar al-Assad's regime, which had been in power for decades. This move marked the end of the civil war that had been raging in Syria since 2011. According to al-Sharaa, elections will require time due to the need for political dialogue among Syria’s various factions and the rewriting of the country’s constitution, which has been under the rule of the Assad family for over fifty years. He also mentioned that the country’s infrastructure, severely damaged by the war, must be rebuilt. Al-Sharaa emphasized that the opportunity Syria now faces is rare and could not be expected again soon. He expressed a desire for the new constitution to be stable and enduring. Until March 1, al-Sharaa will continue as Syria's de facto leader. On that date, Syria's various factions are scheduled to engage in political discussions to shape the country’s future and establish a transitional government. At that time, HTS plans to dissolve, following years of dominance as the primary rebel group controlling a strategic region in the northwest of Syria.The post Syria’s Leader: Elections Could Take Up to 4 Years first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/syrias-leader-election-take-4-years/	2024-12-30T08:51:46-08:00	
Diplomats from France, US, and Saudi Arabia to Visit Lebanon for ...	Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri has called for a parliamentary session on January 9 to elect a president, aiming to resolve the two-year deadlock and revive Lebanon’s struggling state institutions. The session will start with multiple rounds of voting, and Berri emphasized that the key objective is for parliament to elect a president and for members to take responsibility. French Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Noël Barrot and Minister of the French Armed Forces Sébastien Lecornu are scheduled to visit Lebanon on Monday. They are expected to pressure Lebanese leaders to resolve the ongoing presidential crisis. Additionally, U.S. mediator Amos Hochstein and Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan are expected to arrive in Lebanon in early January to discuss the presidential election. Hochstein will meet with Berri and caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati, as well as discuss the ceasefire agreement reached with Israel in late November, according to local media reports. Pro-Hezbollah newspaper al-Akhbar reported that the French, Saudi, and U.S. delegations will likely push for the election of Army chief Gen. Joseph Aoun. Since Michel Aoun's term ended in October 2022, Lebanon has been without a president, with the two main political blocs—Hezbollah and its rivals—unable to reach a consensus or secure the necessary majority for election.The post Diplomats from France, US, and Saudi Arabia to Visit Lebanon for Presidential Talks first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/diplomats-france-us-saudi-arabia-lebanon/	2024-12-30T08:51:36-08:00	
Geagea Vows to Block Hezbollah and FPM’s Presidential ‘Smuggling’...	Samir Geagea, leader of the Lebanese Forces, stated that Lebanon's ruling 'establishment' remains firmly entrenched and unified. He described this establishment as consisting of Hezbollah, its allies, and the Free Patriotic Movement. Despite the emerging differences among the key factions within the establishment, Geagea pointed out that these groups are once again aligning with one another. The disagreements are secondary to their primary concern: their own survival and interests. Geagea also mentioned that the establishment is working discreetly to secure a new president, but they can no longer achieve the kind of leadership they originally desired. He noted that the political climate, both within the Arab world and internationally, is no longer in the establishment's favor, with external parties closely monitoring their actions. The LF leader made it clear that his party and its allies will not allow the establishment to regain its former power.The post Geagea Vows to Block Hezbollah and FPM’s Presidential ‘Smuggling’ Plan first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/geagea-block-hezbollah-fpms-presidential-smuggling-plan/	2024-12-30T08:51:28-08:00	
Ukraine FM Calls for Expulsion of Russian Forces During Syria Vis...	Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga made an unannounced visit to Damascus on Monday, urging Syria's new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa to expel Russian forces from the country. Russia had been a crucial ally of former president Bashar al-Assad, intervening in 2015 to help reverse the tide of Syria’s civil war in Assad’s favor. The overthrow of Assad was a significant blow to Russia, which has since launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Currently, Russia is focused on securing its naval base in Tartus and its air base at Hmeimim, both on Syria's Mediterranean coast, as these are Moscow’s only military installations outside the former Soviet Union. Sybiga stated that both the Russian and Assad regimes relied on violence and torture to maintain control, and he emphasized that removing Russian influence from Syria would benefit not only Syria’s stability but also the broader Middle East and Africa. Sybiga also expressed Ukraine’s willingness to restore relations with Syria, which had soured when Assad recognized Russia's annexation of Ukrainian territories. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Ukraine had sent its first shipment of aid to Syria—a 500-tonne delivery of wheat flour—despite the ongoing war in Ukraine, highlighting Ukraine’s position as one of the world's leading wheat producers. Meanwhile, rebels led by Sharaa's Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), launched an offensive on November 27, quickly capturing several key cities before seizing the capital, Damascus, on December 8, forcing Assad to flee to Russia. Despite Russia’s continued support for Assad, Sharaa emphasized the deep strategic interests between Russia and Syria in an interview with Al-Arabiya TV, stating that Syria’s arms are all of Russian origin and many power plants are operated by Russian experts. He expressed opposition to the idea of Russia withdrawing from Syria in the manner some might hope for.The post Ukraine FM Calls for Expulsion of Russian Forces During Syria Visit first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/ukraine-fm-expulsion-russian-forces-syria-visit/	2024-12-30T08:51:21-08:00	
Russia Claims Ukrainian Drones Target Grozny as Azerbaijani Jet L...	Recommend tags for this article. The head of Russia's civil aviation agency stated on Friday that Ukrainian drones were targeting Grozny while an Azerbaijani Airlines plane was attempting to land there, before the plane later crashed in Kazakhstan. Dmitry Yadrov shared on Telegram that heavy fog had blanketed Grozny when the incident took place on Wednesday, creating 'very complicated' conditions around the airport at the time.Yadrov noted that Ukrainian military drones were carrying out attacks on civilian infrastructure during the event, and the plane had attempted to land twice unsuccessfully. The pilot was then offered the option to land at alternative airports, ultimately choosing to divert to Aktau Airport in Kazakhstan.Additionally, Yadrov mentioned that Grozny Airport had halted both arrivals and departures due to the drone attacks, though he did not specify when this occurred. The Azerbaijan Airlines plane eventually crashed in western Kazakhstan, resulting in the deaths of 38 out of the 67 people on board. Several media outlets have cited Azerbaijani officials suggesting that a Russian air defense missile might have caused the crash. The Kremlin has refrained from commenting on the situation, awaiting the conclusion of the official investigation.

China and Iran FMs: Mideast Shouldn’t Be Big Power Battleground	The foreign ministers of China and Iran agreed on Saturday that the Middle East should not be a region for external geopolitical competition or conflict among major powers. They emphasized that the region must not become a battleground for nations outside the Middle East. Abbas Araghchi, Iran's new foreign minister, is on his first official visit to China. During his discussions with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the two diplomats highlighted the need for international respect for the sovereignty, stability, unity, and territorial integrity of Middle Eastern countries. Both ministers called for a ceasefire in Gaza, the proper enforcement of the ceasefire in Lebanon, and the advancement of efforts related to counter-terrorism, reconciliation, and humanitarian aid in Syria. They agreed that the Middle East belongs to its own people and should not be subject to the geopolitical interests and conflicts of external powers. China and Iran have both supported Syria's former president Bashar al-Assad, although the new Syrian leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, opposes Iran’s influence. In addition to regional issues, the two diplomats discussed Iran's nuclear program, which has raised concerns, particularly from the United States and the UK, regarding potential weapons development. Tensions surrounding Iran's nuclear activities escalated after former President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from a key agreement that had placed limits on Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. Wang reaffirmed China's support for Iran's position on the matter, emphasizing that Beijing stands by Iran in protecting its legitimate rights and interests. As Iran’s largest trading partner, China is also a major buyer of Iranian oil, despite sanctions.The post China and Iran FMs: Mideast Shouldn’t Be Big Power Battleground first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/china-iran-mideast-shouldnt-battleground/	2024-12-29T06:11:13-08:00	
Assad Relatives Arrested Attempting to Flee Lebanon	On Friday, the wife and daughter of one of deposed Syrian president Bashar Assad's cousins were apprehended at Beirut airport for attempting to leave with allegedly forged passports, according to Lebanese judicial and security sources. Assad's uncle had departed the day before without issue. Rasha Khazem, wife of Duraid Assad (son of Rifaat Assad, Bashar's uncle), and their daughter, Shams, were caught trying to fly to Egypt after being smuggled into Lebanon illegally. The two are now being held by Lebanese General Security. Rifaat Assad, known for his brutal past, left the country a day earlier with his real passport, and no issues were reported at the time. Swiss prosecutors had indicted Rifaat Assad earlier in the year for war crimes and crimes against humanity related to his role in the Hama massacre, where thousands of Syrians were killed under his command, earning him the infamous title of the 'Butcher of Hama.' In addition, Lebanese authorities have detained over 20 former members of Syria’s 4th Division, military intelligence officers, and others linked to Assad's regime, many of whom were arrested while attempting to sell weapons in Lebanon. Meanwhile, Lebanon's public prosecution office received an Interpol alert regarding Jamil al-Hassan, the former head of Syrian intelligence. Lebanese officials have confirmed their intent to cooperate with the request to arrest al-Hassan.The post Assad Relatives Arrested Attempting to Flee Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/assad-relatives-arrested-flee-lebanon/	2024-12-29T06:11:06-08:00	
Breaking: Plane Explodes After Skidding Off Runway in South Korea...	A passenger plane caught fire on Sunday after it skidded off a runway at an airport in South Korea, crashing into a concrete wall. The incident, caused by a possible failure of the plane’s front landing gear, resulted in the deaths of most of the 181 people onboard, making it one of the deadliest aviation disasters in South Korean history. The crash occurred at the Muan airport, located about 290 kilometers south of Seoul. The plane, a 15-year-old Boeing 737-800, was returning from Bangkok when the accident happened at 9:03 a.m. According to the National Fire Agency, at least 176 people, including 83 women and 82 men, were confirmed dead in the ensuing fire. Two crew members were rescued and are reportedly in stable condition. Three individuals were still missing after several hours of rescue operations. Rescuers, including 1,560 firefighters, police, and soldiers, worked tirelessly to contain the blaze and assist survivors. Emergency crews deployed 32 fire trucks and helicopters to help with the operation. Footage of the crash showed the plane sliding across the runway, apparently with its landing gear still retracted. After overrunning the runway, it collided with a concrete wall, sparking a massive explosion. The fire chief at Muan airport stated that the plane was completely destroyed, leaving only the tail section intact. Investigations are ongoing to determine the cause of the crash, with initial theories including a potential bird strike. Authorities noted that the control tower had issued a bird strike warning shortly before the incident. They also confirmed that the pilot had issued a distress signal before the crash. Flight data and cockpit voice recorders from the plane have been recovered and will be analyzed as part of the investigation. The Muan airport runway has been closed until January 1 for further examination. The passengers included two Thai nationals, and Thailand’s prime minister expressed condolences and pledged assistance to the victims' families. Jeju Air, the airline operating the flight, offered a deep apology and vowed to manage the aftermath of the tragedy. In a public statement, the airline's president took full responsibility for the crash, stating that no mechanical issues had been reported following the aircraft’s regular maintenance. The crash is one of the worst in South Korea’s aviation history, rivaling previous disasters such as the 1997 Korean Air crash that killed 228 people and the 2013 Asiana Airlines accident in San Francisco. Internationally, it is one of the worst landing accidents in recent years. As the nation grapples with this tragedy, it is also in the midst of a political crisis, with the president facing impeachment and martial law. The crisis added another layer of complexity to the emergency response, with senior government officials coordinating efforts to address the disaster.The post Breaking: Plane Explodes After Skidding Off Runway in South Korea, 176 Dead first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/plane-explodes-skidding-runway-south-korea/	2024-12-29T06:10:58-08:00	
Syrian Embassy Suspends Services as Lebanon Hands Over Assad Offi...	Syria's embassy in Lebanon halted its consular services on Saturday, just one day after two relatives of former Syrian President Bashar Assad were arrested at Beirut airport with suspected fake passports. On the same day, Lebanese authorities deported dozens of Syrians, including former Syrian army officers who had served under Assad, back to the new Syrian authorities after they were caught illegally entering Lebanon. This information was confirmed by both a war monitor and Lebanese officials. The embassy announced on its Facebook page that consular services were suspended 'until further notice,' following an order from the Syrian foreign ministry. However, the embassy did not provide a reason for the suspension. According to two Lebanese security officials, who asked to remain anonymous, the decision was made because the passports belonging to Assad's relatives—his cousin’s wife and daughter—were believed to have been forged at the embassy. It was noted that Assad’s uncle, Rifaat Assad, who faces war crimes and crimes against humanity charges in Switzerland, had departed on his valid passport the day before without issue. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that 70 Syrians, including former officers from Assad’s army, were handed over to the new Syrian authorities, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). Three Lebanese judicial officials confirmed this information, speaking on condition of anonymity. Meanwhile, countries in the region have been quick to engage with Syria's new leadership, with official visits from delegations from Libya and Bahrain arriving in Damascus on Saturday. HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, has worked to ease fears that his group would punish communities supporting Assad’s rule or impose strict Islamic law on religious minorities in Syria. However, tensions remain, with sporadic clashes erupting between HTS-led forces and pro-Assad groups. The new Syrian security forces have raided areas and set up checkpoints in regions populated by the Alawite minority, which Assad belongs to, to search for weapons. There are also ongoing conflicts between Kurdish-led forces in northeastern Syria and armed groups backed by Turkey. Many Kurds are uneasy about the new Syrian order, which they feel strengthens Turkey’s position in the region. Ankara views the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF)—a key ally of the U.S. in fighting ISIS—as linked to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which it considers a terrorist organization. The U.S. State Department reported that Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan on Saturday to discuss developments in Syria. Blinken emphasized the importance of supporting a Syrian-led political process that respects human rights and promotes an inclusive government, and both sides agreed on the shared goal of preventing terrorism from destabilizing both Syria and Turkey. On the same day, hundreds of protesters organized by Kurdish women's groups took part in a demonstration in Hasaka, a city in northeastern Syria, calling for women's rights in the new political order. Perishan Ramadan, a protester from Hasaka, expressed her concerns, stating that the new government is even worse than Bashar Assad’s regime and accusing its leaders of being Islamist extremists who reject any role for women in society. While the new leaders have yet to impose Islamic dress codes or other restrictions, there is uncertainty about what role women will play in the new system, including whether they will hold political positions. Rihan Loqo, a spokeswoman for the Kongra Star women's organization, stressed the importance of ensuring that women's rights are included in Syria’s new constitution, asserting that their rights must not be overlooked.The post Syrian Embassy Suspends Services as Lebanon Hands Over Assad Officers first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/syrian-embassy-suspends-services-lebanon-assad-officers/	2024-12-29T06:10:50-08:00	
Arab League Urges Iran to Avoid Fanning Syria’s Strife	The Arab League has urged Iran to refrain from inciting unrest in Syria following the collapse of President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Assad, who had ruled for decades with the backing of Iran, was overthrown on December 8 after an Islamist-led coalition seized control of key cities and advanced to Damascus, forcing him to flee to Russia. This marked a significant loss for Iran, which had relied on Assad as an ally, especially as its Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah, also faced setbacks after a year of conflict with Israel. Despite welcoming Assad back into the Arab League after a decade of isolation, the organization emphasized the importance of respecting Syria’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and stability. It called for disarming all non-state groups and rejecting foreign interventions that destabilize the country. The League expressed concern over recent events in Syria, where clashes between government forces and remnants of Assad’s loyalists have erupted. In response, Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, predicted the rise of a strong group in Syria, suggesting the country's youth, with little to lose, would play a key role. Tehran’s foreign ministry rejected claims of interference in Syria’s internal affairs, asserting its commitment to Syria’s territorial integrity and a unified political system. Syria’s new leadership has criticized Iran’s involvement in the country, urging Tehran to respect Syria’s sovereignty and warning against actions that could lead to further chaos.The post Arab League Urges Iran to Avoid Fanning Syria’s Strife first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/arab-league-iran-avoid-fanning-syrias-strife/	2024-12-28T02:27:08-08:00	
Jumblat Urges Security Agencies to Wake Up	Lebanese Druze leader Walid Jumblatt has called on the country's security agencies to intensify their efforts in apprehending former regime officials who are reportedly fleeing the country. In a post on the X platform, Jumblatt noted that while the Lebanese Foreign Ministry has recently engaged with Syria's new administration, the security agencies have yet to take action against these individuals. He questioned whether the security forces could 'wake up' and arrest the senior officials who are crossing the border and fleeing through the airport. This statement follows Jumblatt's recent visit to Damascus, where he met with Syria's new leadership. During the meeting, Jumblatt expressed hope for the resumption of diplomatic relations between Lebanon and Syria through the establishment of embassies. He also emphasized the importance of holding accountable those responsible for crimes against the Lebanese people and called for fair trials for all perpetrators. Jumblatt's remarks highlight ongoing concerns about the accountability of former regime officials and the need for proactive measures by security agencies to address these issues.The post Jumblat Urges Security Agencies to Wake Up first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/jumblat-security-agencies-wake-up/	2024-12-28T01:20:26-08:00	
Hochstein Set to Reject Iran’s Role in Lebanon Reconstruction	U.S. mediator Amos Hochstein is poised to deliver a firm message to Lebanese officials, asserting that Iran will not be permitted to participate in Lebanon's reconstruction efforts. This stance aims to prevent Iranian influence from infiltrating the rebuilding process, particularly through financial channels that could potentially support Hezbollah. Hochstein's upcoming visit underscores the United States' commitment to ensuring that Lebanon's reconstruction is managed exclusively by the Lebanese government, free from external interference. The U.S. is determined to prevent any Iranian involvement, whether through direct aid or the engagement of Iranian companies, to maintain the integrity of the reconstruction process. This development follows a recent U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, which has significantly altered the regional dynamics. The ceasefire terms require Hezbollah to withdraw heavy weaponry from southern Lebanon, with an American monitoring mechanism to enforce this. However, doubts remain about the ceasefire’s durability due to past enforcement failures of similar agreements. The Lebanese government now faces the critical task of navigating these geopolitical pressures while striving to rebuild the nation. The exclusion of Iran from the reconstruction process is expected to have significant implications for Lebanon's political landscape and its relationships with neighboring countries.

Iran FM Warns Against Interference in Syria’s Future	Iran's foreign minister warned on Friday against any 'destructive interference' in Syria's future, emphasizing that the decisions regarding the country's future should be made solely by its people. Abbas Araghchi, who arrived in Beijing on Friday for his first official visit to China as foreign minister, made the remarks in an article published in the Chinese state media. Both China and Iran have been supporters of the Syrian regime under Bashar al-Assad, who was forced to flee Syria this month after an Islamist-led offensive resulted in the loss of several key cities, including Damascus on December 8. In his article in People's Daily, Araghchi stated that Iran believes it is up to the Syrian people to decide their future, without any external interference or imposition. He reaffirmed Iran's commitment to Syria's sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a strong ally of Assad's regime, expressed confidence on Sunday that a 'strong, honorable group' would rise to oppose the instability in Syria. Khamenei emphasized that Syria's youth would resist those responsible for the chaos and, with determination, overcome the challenges. Araghchi, in his article, highlighted that supporting the Syrian people is a fundamental principle that all international parties should keep in mind. China, which also maintains a close relationship with Assad, has expressed its support for the Syrian people and opposes any forces exploiting the situation to sow further chaos. In 2023, Assad met with Chinese President Xi Jinping, and the two leaders announced a strategic partnership between their countries. During his two-day visit, Araghchi is expected to hold talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. China is Iran's largest trade partner and a key purchaser of its sanctioned oil. Xi Jinping had previously pledged to strengthen ties with Iran during a meeting with Iranian officials in Russia in October. Araghchi described his visit as timely, given the current tensions in the region and international issues, including the ongoing nuclear discussions. He mentioned that both countries share a common viewpoint that calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza should be a top priority in the Middle East.The post Iran FM Warns Against Interference in Syria’s Future first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/iran-fm-warns-interference-syrias-future/	2024-12-27T05:45:13-08:00	
US Presses Israel to End Violations and Withdraw from Lebanon	The United States has intensified its diplomatic efforts, urging Israel to cease its military operations in southern Lebanon and to fully withdraw its forces, as stipulated in the recent ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah. This call comes amid reports of Israeli incursions into southern Lebanon, raising concerns about the implementation of the ceasefire terms. Israeli forces have reportedly advanced into areas beyond the agreed-upon limits, with incursions reaching up to 8 kilometers north of the UN-designated Blue Line. This escalation has led to increased tensions and displacement of local residents. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which includes 380 Irish soldiers, has expressed deep concern over these developments, highlighting the ongoing destruction of residential and agricultural areas. UNIFIL has called for the immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces and adherence to UN Resolution 1701, which mandates a phased Israeli military pullout and the repositioning of Hezbollah fighters. In response to these violations, the U.S. has emphasized the importance of Israel's compliance with the ceasefire agreement. The U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) reported that Israeli forces conducted a withdrawal from a town in southern Lebanon, with the Lebanese military replacing them under the terms of the ceasefire. The U.S. administration has underscored that the future of Syria should be determined solely by its people, free from external interference. This stance aligns with Iran's position, as expressed by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi during his visit to Beijing. Araghchi emphasized Iran's respect for Syria's unity, national sovereignty, and territorial integrity, advocating for decisions to be made by the Syrian people without foreign imposition. The situation remains fluid, with international stakeholders closely monitoring the developments to ensure the full implementation of the ceasefire and the withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon.

Israel Strikes ‘Infrastructure’ on Syria-Lebanon Border	On December 27, 2024, the Israeli military conducted airstrikes targeting infrastructure along the Syria-Lebanon border, specifically near the village of Janta in Lebanon's Beqaa Valley. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) stated that these strikes aimed to dismantle infrastructure utilized by Hezbollah for weapon transfers. The IDF emphasized that Hezbollah exploits civilian infrastructure for terrorist activities and weapon smuggling intended for attacks against Israeli citizens. The military asserted its commitment to removing any threats to Israel in accordance with the understandings outlined in the ceasefire agreement. This military action follows a recent statement from the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which expressed concern over the ongoing destruction by the Israeli military despite a truce agreement with Hezbollah. UNIFIL has called for the withdrawal of Israeli forces and adherence to UN Resolution 1701, which mandates a phased Israeli military pullout and the repositioning of Hezbollah fighters. The situation remains tense, with the IDF asserting its right to defend Israeli citizens and UNIFIL urging compliance with international resolutions to maintain stability in the region.

Houthis Claim Fresh Attacks on Israel After Yemen Airport Strikes	Yemeni rebels, led by the Houthi movement, claimed responsibility for a missile strike on Israel's Ben Gurion airport and drone attacks on Tel Aviv and a ship in the Arabian Sea, following Israeli airstrikes on rebel-held areas in Yemen. These attacks come after a series of airstrikes by Israel, including a raid on Sanaa's international airport, as tensions between Israel and the Houthis escalate. The Israeli strikes, which targeted military sites, power stations, and ports in Yemen's rebel-controlled territories, followed a missile attack from the Houthis. Israel’s military stated the strikes were aimed at disrupting Houthi military infrastructure and halting Iranian weapons smuggling into the region. The United Nations voiced concern over the escalation, with Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemning the attacks on vital infrastructure, which threaten Yemen's already fragile humanitarian operations. UN Chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who had been in Yemen to negotiate the release of detained UN staff, narrowly escaped injury when the Sanaa airport came under bombardment. The Houthis have intensified their attacks against Israel since late November, and their missile and drone assaults have been aimed at Israeli cities and shipping routes in the Red Sea. Israel has retaliated with airstrikes targeting Houthi-controlled regions, including strategic sites in Sanaa and Hodeida, vital for the entry of humanitarian aid. The conflict has been marked by growing tensions between Israel, Yemen’s Houthis, and Iran, which supports the rebel group in their fight against Saudi-led forces in Yemen.The post Houthis Claim Fresh Attacks on Israel After Yemen Airport Strikes first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/houthis-attacks-israel-yemen-airport-strikes/	2024-12-27T05:44:50-08:00	
Mikati Denies Lebanon Was Told Israel Won’t Withdraw After 60 Day...	On Friday, Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati rejected claims from media reports suggesting that Lebanon had been indirectly informed that Israel would not pull out of southern Lebanon after the 60-day period outlined in the ceasefire agreement. Mikati's office described these reports as 'completely unfounded' and emphasized that the prime minister had urged both the U.S. and France to pressure Israel to withdraw from Lebanese territory and end its ongoing violations. Israeli military sources had informed Haaretz newspaper that the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) might need to remain in Lebanon until the Lebanese army fulfills its obligations under the ceasefire agreement, which includes assuming full control of southern Lebanon. The ceasefire agreement, brokered by the U.S. and other nations, has been in effect for 30 days as of Thursday. Haaretz reported that during this period, the IDF had killed 44 Hezbollah militants in strikes related to violations of the ceasefire. The IDF had responded to 25 of the 120 violations by Hezbollah. At present, the IDF is satisfied with the ceasefire's implementation, coordinated with the Lebanese army, and with U.S. involvement in its enforcement. The Israeli military maintains its presence in all Lebanese villages near the border fence, preventing residents from returning. Additionally, the IDF has begun constructing outposts along the northern border, some of which will be located in Israeli-controlled enclaves. Despite this, these outposts do not cross the international border between Israel and Lebanon. The Israeli military estimates that Hezbollah has lost 30% of its manpower and 75% of its firepower since the conflict began, though the group still possesses hundreds of short- and long-range rockets.The post Mikati Denies Lebanon Was Told Israel Won’t Withdraw After 60 Days first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/mikati-denies-lebanon-israel-wont-withdraw/	2024-12-27T05:44:39-08:00	
Watch: Priest with Machine Gun in Church Sparks Outrage in Lebano...	كاهن مزرعة يشوع يدخل الى صلاة العيد حاملاً سلاح حربي pic.twitter.com/AqlZOSNsY1 &mdash; مصدر مسؤول (@fouadkhreiss) December 25, 2024 A video showing a priest with a machine gun slung over his shoulder inside a church in Lebanon’s Mazraat Yachouh has sparked widespread attention and controversy on social media. The Maronite Diocese of Antelias condemned the priest’s actions, clarifying that the stunt, which was not sanctioned by the church, was part of a sermon aimed at emphasizing that 'a believer’s weapon is the cross.' According to a statement from the diocese, the priest placed the weapon in front of the congregation and urged them to abandon all forms of violence that harm others, encouraging them to embrace the cross as the only true weapon—symbolizing love and forgiveness. While the diocese expressed approval of the sermon’s message, which aligns with the church’s teachings, it distanced itself from the method used by the priest. The church issued a written warning, requesting that such actions not be repeated. The diocese also emphasized the importance of preventing the incident from being seen through a sectarian lens and hoped it would not be used to fuel division or resentment, particularly given the current tensions in the country.The post Watch: Priest with Machine Gun in Church Sparks Outrage in Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/priest-machine-gun-church-outrage-lebanon/	2024-12-26T06:34:20-08:00	
Israeli Strike Kills 5 Palestinian Journalists in Gaza	An Israeli airstrike overnight in the Gaza Strip killed five Palestinian journalists outside a hospital, according to the Health Ministry. The attack targeted a car near the Al-Awda Hospital in the Nuseirat refugee camp, located in central Gaza. The journalists were working for the Quds News Network, which also confirmed the strike. The Israeli military stated that it was targeting a group of militants from Islamic Jihad, a group affiliated with Hamas, which launched the October 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, sparking the ongoing conflict. The Committee to Protect Journalists reported that more than 130 Palestinian reporters have been killed since the war began. Israel has restricted access to Gaza for foreign journalists, allowing only military embeds. The conflict started when Hamas militants breached the border in a surprise assault, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking approximately 250 hostages. As of now, about 100 hostages remain in Gaza, with at least a third feared dead. Israel's ongoing air and ground offensive has claimed the lives of more than 45,000 Palestinians, with the Health Ministry stating that over half of the casualties are women and children. The military actions have caused widespread devastation, displacing about 90% of Gaza's population, which totals 2.3 million. Many have sought refuge in overcrowded tent camps along the coast, struggling to endure the harsh winter conditions.The post Israeli Strike Kills 5 Palestinian Journalists in Gaza first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strike-kills-5-palestinian-journalists-gaza/	2024-12-26T06:34:12-08:00	
UNIFIL Condemns Israel’s Destruction of Homes, Infrastructure in ...	The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) issued a warning on Thursday, emphasizing the importance of halting any actions that could jeopardize the fragile ceasefire in southern Lebanon. The organization reiterated that both Israel and Lebanon had committed to fully implementing Security Council resolution 1701 and encouraged both sides to use the newly-established Mechanism to resolve any remaining issues. UNIFIL called for the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) to withdraw from southern Lebanon and for the Lebanese Armed Forces to deploy in the area as part of the full implementation of resolution 1701, which aims to pave the way for peace. The peacekeeping force emphasized that it would continue to support both countries in fulfilling their obligations and monitoring progress. This includes ensuring the area south of the Litani River remains free of armed personnel and weapons, except for those of the Lebanese government and UNIFIL, and upholding respect for the Blue Line. The statement also expressed concern over ongoing destruction caused by Israeli forces in southern Lebanon, including damage to residential areas, farmland, and infrastructure, which it deemed a violation of resolution 1701. UNIFIL peacekeepers will persist in their duties to monitor and report violations of the resolution to the Security Council. A truce between Israel and Hezbollah went into effect on November 27, following an escalation of violence in the region. Since then, both sides have accused each other of violating the ceasefire. The ceasefire agreement stipulated that UNIFIL and the Lebanese Army would redeploy in southern Lebanon, with Israeli forces pulling back over a period of 60 days. The resolution calls for the withdrawal of Israeli troops and the establishment of Lebanese and UNIFIL forces as the only military presence in the area, where Hezbollah holds significant influence. Earlier this week, UNIFIL had urged quicker progress regarding the Israeli military's withdrawal. Meanwhile, Lebanon's National News Agency reported continued Israeli military activities in southern Lebanon, including an incursion into the town of Qantara, which led to residents fleeing to nearby villages. Additionally, Israeli aircraft struck the eastern Baalbek region, far from the border, on Wednesday.The post UNIFIL Condemns Israel’s Destruction of Homes, Infrastructure in South Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/unifil-israels-destruction-homes-infrastructure/	2024-12-26T06:34:01-08:00	
Israeli Army Raids Wadi al-Hujeir, Detains Citizen, Forces Evacua...	On Thursday, Israeli forces violated the ceasefire agreement by entering southern areas including al-Qantara, Adsheet al-Qusayr, and Wadi al-Hujeir, according to the Lebanese Army. The army accused Israel of continuing to breach the ceasefire, undermining Lebanon’s sovereignty, and causing destruction in southern towns and villages. In response, the Lebanese Army increased its presence in the affected areas and continued to monitor the situation in coordination with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and the five-party ceasefire monitoring committee. Israeli forces, advancing in the region, used heavy machine guns and forced residents of al-Qantara to flee to nearby towns like al-Ghandouriyeh and Srifa. Additionally, Israeli forces abducted Lebanese citizen Hossam Fawwaz while he was on his way to work at the UNIFIL Indonesian contingent in Adsheet al-Qusayr. Fawwaz was later released and handed over to UNIFIL and the Lebanese Red Cross, who transported him to receive treatment for a gunshot wound to his head. These incidents led the Lebanese Army to block the road between its post in Qaaqaaiyet al-Jisr and Wadi al-Hujeir, while Israeli Merkava tanks patrolled the valley, accompanied by Israeli machinegun fire. The Majdal Selm Municipality also advised locals to avoid the Slouqi-Hujeir road towards Nabatieh and its surrounding sideroads. Later, a UNIFIL patrol visited the al-Qantara intersection, where Israeli forces were present. The National News Agency reported that Israeli bulldozers were constructing dirt barriers to block the road connecting Wadi Slouqi to Wadi al-Hujeir. In response to these actions, Hezbollah’s Caretaker Labor Minister Mustafa Bayram called for a 'historic lesson' and declared that resistance remains the only viable solution. Hezbollah lawmaker Ali Fayyad condemned the Israeli incursion, labeling it 'extremely dangerous' and a serious threat to the implementation of UN Resolution 1701.The post Israeli Army Raids Wadi al-Hujeir, Detains Citizen, Forces Evacuations first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-army-raids-wadi-al-hujeir-detains-citizen/	2024-12-26T06:33:52-08:00	
Report: Israeli Army Plans Extended Stay in Lebanon Beyond Ceasef...	According to sources within the Israeli military, the Israeli army has stated that it will need to remain in Lebanon until the Lebanese army can fully take control of southern Lebanon, as stipulated by the terms of the ceasefire agreement. This agreement, which was brokered by the U.S. and other nations, came into effect 30 days ago, marking a month since the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. During this period, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) reported that 44 Hezbollah militants were killed in strikes by the IDF for violating the ceasefire. Of the 120 violations recorded, the army launched attacks in response to 25 of them. Currently, the IDF is satisfied with the implementation of the agreement, noting that it has been carried out in cooperation with the Lebanese army and with support from the United States. The Israeli army remains stationed in all Lebanese villages near the border, where residents have not yet been allowed to return. Additionally, the IDF has begun constructing outposts along the northern border, some of which will be positioned in Israeli-controlled areas beyond the border fence. These outposts will not cross the international boundary between Israel and Lebanon, although in certain areas considered vulnerable, the outposts will be located in enclaves beyond the border. The Israeli military believes that Hezbollah has suffered significant losses during the conflict, with an estimated 30% of its manpower and 75% of its firepower destroyed since October 6, 2023. Despite these losses, the defense establishment assesses that Hezbollah still possesses hundreds of short-range rockets and long-range missiles.The post Report: Israeli Army Plans Extended Stay in Lebanon Beyond Ceasefire Terms first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-army-extended-stay-lebanon/	2024-12-26T06:33:42-08:00	
Pakistani Airstrikes Kill 46 in Afghanistan	Airstrikes conducted by Pakistan in Afghanistan's eastern Paktika province have resulted in the deaths of 46 people, according to a spokesperson for the Taliban government. The Pakistani attacks are the latest escalation in the ongoing tensions at the border, which have been rising since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 2021. Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban spokesman, reported that the airstrikes hit four areas in the Barmal district on Tuesday. The majority of those killed were women and children, and six others were injured, also mostly children. The Taliban condemned the airstrikes, calling them 'barbaric' and an act of 'clear aggression.' They stated that they would not let this act go unanswered and emphasized their right to defend Afghan territory and sovereignty. These strikes follow previous clashes at the border, including deadly airstrikes in March by Pakistan that the Taliban said killed eight civilians. Maleel, a local resident of Barmal, reported that one family lost 18 members when a bombardment struck their home, while another attack killed three people in a nearby house. The victims were mostly local residents and others who had fled from Waziristan in Pakistan. The Barmal district borders North Waziristan, an area long associated with militancy. Pakistan had launched a military offensive in this region, along with U.S. drone strikes, during the post-9/11 occupation of Afghanistan. The recent airstrike comes after the Pakistani Taliban (TTP), which shares an ideology with the Afghan Taliban, claimed responsibility for an attack on a Pakistani army outpost last week, killing 16 soldiers. Pakistan has expressed concerns about the Taliban providing sanctuary to TTP fighters, accusing them of launching attacks on Pakistani territory without facing repercussions. The Taliban, however, denies these claims and has promised to expel foreign militant groups. A July U.N. Security Council report estimated that as many as 6,500 TTP fighters are based in Afghanistan, with the Taliban not considering them a terrorist group. This growing violence has further strained relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan. In response to security concerns, Pakistan recently initiated a campaign to expel undocumented Afghan migrants. There has been no official comment from Pakistan regarding the latest airstrike. Meanwhile, high-ranking Taliban officials were meeting with Pakistan’s special envoy for Afghanistan in Kabul on the same day the airstrikes occurred.The post Pakistani Airstrikes Kill 46 in Afghanistan first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/pakistani-airstrikes-kill-46-afghanistan/	2024-12-25T11:13:59-08:00	
Syrians Protest Attack on Alawite Shrine After Shocking Video	Protests erupted across several regions of Syria on Wednesday after a video emerged showing an attack on an Alawite shrine in northern Syria, according to witnesses and a war monitor. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that large demonstrations took place in the coastal cities of Tartus and Latakia, which are home to the Alawite minority, the sect to which former president Bashar al-Assad belongs. Protests were also reported in parts of the central city of Homs and other areas, including Qardaha, Assad's hometown. Witnesses informed AFP that protests took place in Tartus, Latakia, and nearby Jableh, with images from Jableh showing large crowds in the streets chanting slogans such as 'Alawite, Sunni, we want peace.' In response to the unrest, the state news agency SANA reported that authorities in central Homs imposed a curfew from 6:00 pm to 8:00 am, and a similar nighttime curfew was announced in Jableh. The protests followed the circulation of a video earlier that day showing an attack on a significant Alawite shrine in Aleppo's Maysaloon district. The video claimed that five workers were killed in the attack and the shrine was set on fire. Syrian authorities have dismissed the video as 'old,' claiming it showed an incident from earlier in the month when Islamist-led rebels captured northern Aleppo. An interior ministry statement noted that the video was being republished to 'stir up strife' during a sensitive time for the country. Bashar al-Assad has long portrayed himself as the protector of Syria’s minority groups, particularly the Alawites, in a nation dominated by Sunni Muslims.The post Syrians Protest Attack on Alawite Shrine After Shocking Video first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/syrians-protest-attack-alawite-shrine/	2024-12-25T11:13:49-08:00	
Pop Star Alameh’s Mocking of Nasrallah Sparks Outrage in Lebanon	A video that recently circulated online featuring Lebanese pop star Ragheb Alameh speaking on the phone with Emirati singer Abdullah Belkheir sparked anger among many Lebanese citizens. In the video, Alameh appeared to praise the killing of former Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. Nasrallah, a highly revered figure among his supporters and even some non-supporters of Hezbollah, was killed in September during an Israeli airstrike in Beirut's southern suburbs. Lebanon, already deeply divided along sectarian and political lines, was further polarized by this video, with some defending Alameh's comments while others expressed outrage. In the video, Belkheir, speaking on loudspeaker, responded with a laugh after Alameh allegedly stated that 'we've got rid of Nasrallah,' to which Belkheir responded, 'Thank God.' Following the uproar, Alameh claimed that the voice in the video was either generated by AI or someone impersonating him. In the wake of the controversy, a group of individuals attempted to vandalize Alameh's school in Sainte Therese, Hadath. Alameh, who hails from a Shiite family in Ghoubeiry, Beirut, was granted a UAE golden visa in 2021.The post Pop Star Alameh’s Mocking of Nasrallah Sparks Outrage in Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/pop-star-alamehs-mocking-nasrallah-outrage-lebanon/	2024-12-24T05:28:55-08:00	
Army Seizes PFLP-GC Post in Qousaya	The Lebanese Army has taken control of a key site belonging to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command (PFLP-GC) in Qousaya, located in the Beqaa Valley. This move is part of a broader effort by the Lebanese military to assert control over areas previously held by various armed groups. The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) announced that they had successfully entered the PFLP-GC headquarters and deployed units around the site. This operation is part of a larger campaign that includes taking control of additional locations such as Sultan Yacoub and Bar Elias in the Beqaa region. In addition to securing the PFLP-GC sites, the Lebanese Army's efforts include the recent takeover of positions held by the Fatah al-Intifada group, and the dismantling of weaponry and military equipment from these areas. This initiative aligns with the enforcement of UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which aims to maintain peace and security in the region following the 2006 Lebanon War. Furthermore, the Israeli Army has continued its activities in southern Lebanon, including demolition operations and the establishment of new military posts, which complicates the security dynamics in the region. These developments underscore the ongoing tensions and efforts to stabilize the area, involving various regional and international stakeholders.The post Army Seizes PFLP-GC Post in Qousaya first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/army-seizes-pflp-gc-post-qousaya/	2024-12-24T05:28:29-08:00	
Lebanon PM, UN Urge Faster Israeli Withdrawal	United Nations peacekeepers and interim Prime Minister Najib Mikati have urged the Israeli military to expedite its withdrawal from Lebanon, following nearly a month of a delicate ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. UNIFIL, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, emphasized the need for the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) to accelerate their withdrawal and for the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) to take up positions in southern Lebanon. The force called on all parties to adhere to UN Security Council Resolution 1701 and avoid any actions that could disrupt the current fragile peace. Mikati appealed to the United States and France to pressure Israel into completing its withdrawal more swiftly. He stressed that the international committee, comprising the US, France, Lebanon, Israel, and UNIFIL, must ensure that all ceasefire violations are addressed promptly. As part of the ceasefire agreement, the Lebanese army and peacekeepers are to deploy in southern Lebanon as the Israeli forces withdraw over a 60-day period. Mikati, during a visit to the southern town of Khiam, urged for expedited pressure on Israel to halt all ceasefire violations, accusing Israel of stalling. The Lebanese army reported its deployment around Khiam, five kilometers from the border, in coordination with UNIFIL following the Israeli troop withdrawal. However, the Lebanese National News Agency (NNA) noted continued Israeli activities in southern Lebanon, including raising the Israeli flag on a hill between Bayada and Naqoura and dynamiting homes in border villages. The Israeli military, on the other hand, stated it was continuing defensive operations in the south in line with the agreement and had confiscated various weapons and military equipment from a warehouse. The ceasefire, effective since November 27, followed more than a year of cross-border hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, which escalated into full-scale war and the deployment of Israeli troops into southern Lebanon. Mikati expressed his desire to resolve any disputes regarding the Blue Line, the UN-demarcated boundary between Lebanon and Israel, to eliminate any justification for Israeli occupation. He also mentioned efforts to establish a trust fund for reconstruction, with support from the World Bank, the European Union, Arab nations, and international partners. The World Bank estimated in October that the conflict had caused physical damage in Lebanon amounting to at least $3.4 billion.The post Lebanon PM, UN Urge Faster Israeli Withdrawal first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lebanon-pm-un-faster-israeli-withdrawal/	2024-12-24T05:28:20-08:00	
Netanyahu Reports ‘Some Progress’ in Ceasefire, Hostage Deal	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has indicated there is some advancement in the negotiations for a hostage and ceasefire deal in Gaza, though he did not specify a timeline for a potential agreement. Around 100 of the approximately 250 individuals taken hostage during the Hamas-led raid on Israel on October 7, 2023, remain in Gaza. It is believed that at least a third of these hostages are deceased. Addressing the Knesset on Monday, Netanyahu stated that significant measures are being taken across various channels to secure the return of the hostages. He cautiously noted that there is some progress in these efforts. Netanyahu did not disclose specific actions being undertaken to facilitate the hostages' release. He attributed the progress to the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and Israel's military operations against Iran-backed Hezbollah militants, who have been launching rockets into Israel from Lebanon in support of Hamas. Netanyahu highlighted that Hamas had expected support from Iran and Hezbollah, but these groups are currently focused on recovering from the setbacks inflicted by Israel. He also mentioned the continuous military pressure being applied on Hamas in Gaza. Netanyahu concluded by emphasizing that while there is progress, the duration of the efforts remains uncertain.The post Netanyahu Reports ‘Some Progress’ in Ceasefire, Hostage Deal first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/netanyahu-some-progress-ceasefire-hostage-deal/	2024-12-24T05:28:08-08:00	
Watch: Israel Admits to Killing Ex-Hamas Leader Haniyeh in Tehran	In a significant development, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz has publicly acknowledged that Israel was responsible for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July 2024. Haniyeh, who had been Hamas's overall leader until his death, was killed during a visit to Tehran. This admission marks the first time Israel has officially claimed responsibility for the operation. Minister Katz emphasized that Israel's actions against leaders of groups such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and other Iranian-backed organizations are part of a broader strategy to counter regional threats. The acknowledgment of Haniyeh's assassination is expected to further escalate tensions between Israel and Iran, as well as with other regional actors.

Israel Frees 7 Civilians Detained in South Lebanon After Truce	On Sunday, Israeli forces handed over seven detainees to United Nations peacekeepers at the border as part of a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. According to Lebanese state media, the prisoners had been held by Israel after the ceasefire came into effect. This event follows Israel's intensified military operations in southern Lebanon, which began in late September, after Hezbollah's cross-border attacks in support of Hamas. These actions were in response to the October 7, 2023, Hamas assault on southern Israel. A ceasefire was established on November 27, though both sides have accused each other of violations since then. The seven detainees were transferred to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) at Ras Naqoura, then taken to a hospital for medical checkups with assistance from the Lebanese Red Cross and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Afterward, they were sent to Sidon for further investigation. The ceasefire agreement stipulated that the Lebanese army would deploy in southern Lebanon alongside UN peacekeepers, while Israel would begin withdrawing its forces over a 60-day period. Hezbollah was also required to relocate its forces north of the Litani River, and dismantle its military infrastructure in the south. In the meantime, the Israeli army claimed to have located and destroyed a combat compound in southern Lebanon containing several weapons storage facilities. Despite the ceasefire, Israel has continued to carry out military actions, including bombings in the towns of Kfar Kila and Bint Jbeil, leading to condemnation from Lebanese media regarding repeated attacks on southern villages.The post Israel Frees 7 Civilians Detained in South Lebanon After Truce first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-frees-7-civilians-south-lebanon-truce/	2024-12-23T04:03:04-08:00	
Mikati Tours Military Positions in South Lebanon	Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati has initiated a visit to military positions in southern Lebanon, nearly a month after a ceasefire agreement ended the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. This marks Mikati's first trip to the southern frontlines, where, as per the U.S.-mediated deal, Lebanese troops are set to gradually deploy. Both Hezbollah fighters and Israeli forces are expected to pull back by the end of next month. Mikati's tour follows ongoing frustration from the Lebanese government over Israeli airstrikes and overflights. After meeting with Lebanese Army Commander Joseph Aoun at a military base in Marjayoun, Mikati emphasized the tasks ahead. He stressed the importance of ensuring Israel’s withdrawal from the territories it had occupied during its recent military actions, stating that this would enable the Lebanese army to fully carry out its duties. The Lebanese military has long depended on foreign aid, particularly from the U.S. and other Western nations, to maintain its operations. With the conflict’s conclusion and the ceasefire in place, Lebanon hopes that additional funding will bolster the army’s capacity to establish a stronger presence in the south, where Hezbollah’s armed units had been active.

He pointed out that these young individuals, who now face instability after Assad's ousting, have 'nothing to lose' and are likely to resist the new order. Khamenei emphasized that these Syrians should stand firm against those he believes are responsible for the insecurity in the country. He reiterated accusations that the U.S. and Israel were behind the instability in Syria, claiming they aimed to exploit the country’s resources. Iran has been a key supporter of Assad’s regime during Syria's civil war, which began after Assad's violent crackdown on protests. Syria has also served as a critical route for Iranian support to Hezbollah. Khamenei's remarks came after a year of significant losses for Iran's regional allies, including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, which was forced to agree to a ceasefire after heavy Israeli strikes. Despite the setbacks, Khamenei denied that groups like Hezbollah and Hamas act as Iranian proxies, asserting that these groups fight due to their own convictions. He further stated that if Iran ever needed to take action, it would not rely on proxy forces.The post Iran’s Khamenei Predicts Syrian Youth Will Resist New Government first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/irans-khamenei-syrian-youth-resist-new-government/	2024-12-23T04:02:33-08:00	
Khamenei Denies Having or Needing Regional Proxy Forces	Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei rejected claims that militant groups in the region act as Tehran's proxies, stating that if Iran needed to take action, it would not rely on them. His comments came amid significant losses for Iran-backed groups such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, both of which faced defeats in their ongoing conflicts with Israel. Additionally, the fall of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, a key ally in Iran’s so-called axis of resistance, added to the regional shifts. Khamenei insisted that groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, and Yemen's Houthi rebels are motivated by their own beliefs, not by Iran's influence. He emphasized that these groups fight because of their faith, not as part of a proxy network for Tehran. Khamenei further dismissed American claims that Iran had lost control over its regional proxies, asserting that Iran would not need proxy forces if it chose to take action. The collapse of Assad’s regime earlier this month marked a significant shift in the regional balance, as Assad had long been a key partner for Iran, especially in supporting Hezbollah. Khamenei expressed confidence that Syria would soon see the rise of a strong, independent group of fighters, predicting that Syria’s youth, who have nothing to lose, would form this group. He also accused the United States of attempting to destabilize Iran, promising that the Iranian people would reject any foreign influence or attempts to interfere with their sovereignty.The post Khamenei Denies Having or Needing Regional Proxy Forces first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/khamenei-denies-needing-proxy-forces/	2024-12-23T04:02:25-08:00	
Ex-Israeli Spies Reveal Hezbollah Pager Attack Details	Two recently retired senior Israeli intelligence officers revealed new details about a covert operation targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria, which utilized explosive devices hidden in pagers and walkie-talkies. The operation, years in the making, was carried out three months ago and was revealed in a segment on CBS’s '60 Minutes.' The operation began over a decade ago with walkie-talkies laced with explosives, which Hezbollah unwittingly purchased from Israel. The walkie-talkies weren’t detonated until September, a day after the pagers, which had been rigged to explode, were triggered. The explosive devices were part of a larger plan to strike Hezbollah militants. In 2022, Mossad learned that Hezbollah was acquiring pagers from a Taiwanese company and decided to turn the situation to their advantage. The pagers were altered to accommodate explosives and tested to ensure they would cause harm only to the target while minimizing risk to bystanders. Mossad also experimented with various ringtones to ensure the pagers would be noticed. The operation also involved deceiving Hezbollah into thinking it was purchasing equipment from legitimate suppliers, using false ads and shell companies to mislead the Taiwanese firm. The pagers were marketed as rugged and efficient, convincing Hezbollah to buy a new, larger model with hidden explosives. By September, Hezbollah had acquired thousands of these altered pagers. The explosive devices were detonated on September 17, causing widespread panic. The following day, Mossad activated the walkie-talkies, some of which exploded during funerals for victims of the pager explosions. The explosions were intended to send a powerful message to Hezbollah, demonstrating Israel’s technological superiority and the cost of challenging Israel. The explosions caused significant psychological impact in Lebanon, with people fearing further attacks from everyday objects. Israel’s air strikes soon followed, leading to heavy casualties, including the assassination of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. The operation concluded with a ceasefire by November. The Israeli agents behind the operation explained that the aim was not just to kill but to cripple Hezbollah, creating visible, long-lasting reminders of Israel’s power in the region. The fear instilled in the population, they explained, was part of the psychological warfare that Israel hoped to maintain as a deterrent.The post Ex-Israeli Spies Reveal Hezbollah Pager Attack Details first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/ex-israeli-spies-hezbollah-pager-attack-details/	2024-12-23T04:02:10-08:00	
Yemeni Missile Strikes Tel Aviv, Say Israel and Houthis	A missile fired from Yemen hit Tel Aviv early on Saturday, marking a rare failure in the city's missile defense system. Israeli authorities confirmed that the missile landed in the southern Jaffa area of Tel Aviv. Despite air defense efforts, the missile was not intercepted, and sirens sounded before the impact. Emergency services reported that more than a dozen people sustained minor injuries, primarily from broken glass, but no fatalities occurred. The Houthis in Yemen, backed by Iran, claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that they launched a hypersonic ballistic missile, named 'Palestine 2,' which accurately struck its target. At least 16 people were treated for minor injuries, while others sought shelter or suffered panic-related symptoms. One resident described the explosion as terrifying, with windows shattered in nearby buildings. Tel Aviv, Israel's commercial and diplomatic hub, is rarely hit by direct missile strikes due to the country's advanced air defense system. However, since the war with Hamas began in October 2023, Israel has faced missile attacks from other Iran-backed groups, including Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. Most of these missiles have been intercepted by Israel's defense systems. The Houthis have been targeting ships in the Red Sea in response to the ongoing Gaza conflict, and their attacks, alongside those from Hamas and Hezbollah, are part of a broader Iran-led alliance. This coalition has vowed to continue striking Israel and its allies until a ceasefire is achieved in Gaza. The attacks intensified following Hamas's deadly assault on Israel on October 7, 2023, which sparked the ongoing conflict.The post Yemeni Missile Strikes Tel Aviv, Say Israel and Houthis first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/yemeni-missile-strikes-tel-aviv/	2024-12-22T01:07:16-08:00	
Israel and Hamas Near Ceasefire Deal: Key Sticking Points Reveale...	Israel and Hamas are reportedly closer to reaching a ceasefire agreement that could end the 14-month war in Gaza and facilitate the return of numerous hostages. However, previous attempts to reach a deal have failed due to unresolved issues, and this round of talks faces its own set of challenges. The proposed ceasefire deal would be implemented in stages, starting with a halt in fighting, followed by the exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and a significant increase in humanitarian aid to Gaza. The final phase would see the release of any remaining hostages, the end of the war, and discussions on Gaza's reconstruction. Although there is optimism on both sides, key obstacles remain, particularly regarding which hostages and prisoners will be exchanged and the status of Israeli troops in Gaza. Israeli officials are working on determining the list of hostages to be released in the first phase, which is expected to focus on women, the elderly, and those with medical conditions. Negotiations also continue over the exact number of Palestinian prisoners to be freed, with Hamas pushing for the release of high-profile detainees. In addition, Israel’s decision to withdraw troops from Palestinian population centers is another sticking point. While there is an expectation that some displaced people will be allowed to return to Gaza, the specifics of the withdrawal and the areas from which people can return remain unresolved. Israel is particularly concerned about the return of displaced people to areas near the Israeli border, fearing that militant activity could resume from those regions. The ongoing talks are also complicated by political pressures in Israel, with some factions opposing concessions, particularly the release of prisoners involved in violent attacks. Furthermore, some Israeli officials suggest more drastic measures, including proposals to empty northern Gaza and cut off humanitarian aid in a bid to eliminate militants. U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, have expressed hope that an agreement could be finalized before President Joe Biden’s term ends on January 20, 2025, aiming to bring relief to the people of Gaza and secure the release of hostages.The post Israel and Hamas Near Ceasefire Deal: Key Sticking Points Revealed first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-hamas-ceasefire-key-points/	2024-12-21T08:27:47-08:00	
Erdogan Calls for Eradication of IS and Kurdish Fighters in Syria	Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared on Friday that it is essential to eliminate groups that threaten Syria's survival, particularly the Islamic State (ISIS) and Kurdish fighters. Erdogan emphasized the need to neutralize terrorist organizations like ISIS and the PKK, as well as their affiliates, to ensure Syria's stability. He referred to the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which include the Kurdish YPG militia, as a terror organization due to its links with the PKK, a group involved in a long-standing insurgency against Turkey. While the SDF played a critical role in the fight against ISIS in Syria, especially in 2019, the United States views them as essential to preventing the resurgence of jihadist forces. Erdogan stressed that Turkey is taking preventive actions against groups that pose a risk to its security and expressed confidence that Syria’s new leadership would refrain from collaborating with such organizations. He warned that the leaders of these groups, including ISIS and the PKK-YPG, would be swiftly targeted. Furthermore, Erdogan mentioned that Turkey’s foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, is set to visit Damascus soon, following a recent meeting between Turkey's spy chief, Ibrahim Kalin, and the leadership of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) in Syria, which occurred just days after the fall of Assad's government.The post Erdogan Calls for Eradication of IS and Kurdish Fighters in Syria first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/erdogan-eradication-is-kurdish-fighters-syria/	2024-12-21T08:27:35-08:00	
Yemeni Rocket Strikes Tel Aviv, 16 Injured	The Israeli military reported that a rocket launched from Yemen struck an area near Tel Aviv early on Saturday, injuring 16 people with glass shards from nearby windows. Another 14 individuals sustained minor injuries while rushing to shelters when air raid sirens were activated shortly before the attack at 4 a.m. local time. This incident follows Israeli airstrikes on Yemen's Houthi-controlled capital, Sanaa, and the port city of Hodeida two days prior, which resulted in at least nine deaths. These strikes were retaliation for a missile attack by the Houthis that hit an Israeli school building. The Houthis also claimed responsibility for a drone strike on an unspecified Israeli military target earlier in the week. The Israeli military has reported that the Iran-backed Houthis have launched over 200 missiles and drones during the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Additionally, the Houthis have been targeting shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, promising to continue these attacks until a ceasefire is established in Gaza. The recent Israeli strikes have significantly damaged the Houthi-controlled Red Sea ports, particularly the Hodeida port, which is crucial for food shipments to Yemen. The United Nations has expressed concern over the escalating violence, warning that both sides' actions could further destabilize the region and undermine ongoing U.N. mediation efforts.The post Yemeni Rocket Strikes Tel Aviv, 16 Injured first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/yemeni-rocket-strikes-tel-aviv-16-injured/	2024-12-21T08:27:24-08:00	
Two Dead, 60 Injured as Car Plows into Germany Christmas Market	A tragic incident occurred on Friday in the German city of Magdeburg when a car drove into a busy outdoor Christmas market, resulting in the deaths of at least two people and injuries to over 60 others. Authorities have labeled the incident a deliberate attack. The car crashed into the market around 7 p.m., a peak time for holiday shoppers, and the driver was promptly arrested at the scene. Footage of the arrest showed the suspect lying on the ground as officers took him into custody. The two confirmed fatalities were an adult and a child, but there are concerns that more lives may have been lost, as 15 people sustained serious injuries. The attack shocked the city, with the mayor visibly emotional and the event tarnishing a festive tradition that dates back centuries. The tragedy prompted several other German cities to cancel their weekend Christmas markets in solidarity. The suspect, a 50-year-old Saudi doctor who has lived in Germany since 2006, was practicing in Bernburg, a town near Magdeburg. Officials confirmed he acted alone, and there was no ongoing threat to the city. This incident is a grim reminder of a similar attack in 2016, when an Islamic extremist drove a truck into a Christmas market in Berlin, killing 13 people. In the wake of the attack, the German government and public figures expressed their condolences, with flags to be lowered to half-staff across Saxony-Anhalt. International leaders also voiced support, including German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and U.S. Vice President-elect JD Vance. Magdeburg’s mayor announced plans for a memorial at the city's cathedral, and a minute of silence was held at a football match later that evening in honor of the victims.The post Two Dead, 60 Injured as Car Plows into Germany Christmas Market first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/two-dead-60-injured-car-plows-germany-christmas-market/	2024-12-21T08:27:14-08:00	
Three Bodies Found After Israeli Strike on Nasrallah	Lebanese rescuers recovered three bodies from the ruins of a building in Beirut that was hit by an Israeli airstrike in September, which also resulted in the death of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. The health ministry has not provided a confirmed death toll for the strike that destroyed several buildings in Haret Hreik, a Hezbollah stronghold in southern Beirut. On Friday morning, rescuers began searching for seven people still missing at the site, with the National News Agency reporting the recovery of three bodies. These remains were transported to Rafik Hariri University Hospital in Beirut for DNA testing to confirm their identities. Search efforts continued for other missing individuals. The Israeli airstrike on September 27 targeted Nasrallah in an underground bunker within a residential area. Nasrallah was killed along with four others, including Hezbollah's southern Lebanon commander and a senior member of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. His burial took place at a secret location to avoid Israeli targeting of his funeral. Although a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah began on November 27, bringing an end to a conflict that claimed over 4,000 lives in Lebanon, Israeli airstrikes have continued to kill more than 20 people in the country since that time. Both Israel and Hezbollah have accused each other of violating the ceasefire agreement.The post Three Bodies Found After Israeli Strike on Nasrallah first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/three-bodies-found-israeli-strike-nasrallah/	2024-12-21T08:26:51-08:00	
Gemayel Vows No Revenge, Calls for Unity as Lebanon ‘Rises Again’	Kataeb leader Sami Gemayel stated on Friday that Hezbollah should understand that the Lebanese people will no longer accept being under its control or treated as second-class citizens. He emphasized that his stance is not about seeking revenge, nor about excluding or isolating anyone, including Hezbollah, Amal, and their supporters. However, he made it clear that all groups must abide by the law and the constitution. He also stressed that the era of chaos has ended, and moving forward, no group other than the Lebanese army should be allowed to hold arms. Gemayel, in preparation for the presidential vote set for January 9, reiterated that the next president must uphold the ceasefire agreement. However, his party and other opposition groups have not yet agreed on a candidate. The ceasefire agreement from November stipulates that the Lebanese army and UN peacekeepers will be the only armed forces in southern Lebanon, an area that has historically been under Hezbollah's influence. Gemayel expressed optimism for Lebanon's future, declaring that the obstacles which once hindered state-building and isolated Lebanon from its Arab neighbors and the international community are now gone.The post Gemayel Vows No Revenge, Calls for Unity as Lebanon ‘Rises Again’ first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/gemayel-no-revenge-calls-unity/	2024-12-20T08:51:43-08:00	
US Delegation Holds Talks with al-Jolani in Damascus	U.S. diplomats met Syria's newly appointed leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, on Friday, marking the first official contact since the fall of former president Bashar al-Assad. This meeting comes amid international concerns over the direction of Syria’s leadership, with many powers seeking assurances that the country’s new authorities will be moderate and inclusive, particularly in regard to the rights of minorities, women, and the Kurdish population. The rapid offensive that led to Assad's removal was spearheaded by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a group originally linked to al-Qaeda but which has recently presented itself as more moderate. The unexpected shift in power has forced foreign governments, especially the U.S., to reassess their policies, given HTS is considered a terrorist organization by some countries. Although the U.S. delegation had planned a press conference, it was canceled due to security concerns. The diplomats are also engaging with various Syrian civil society groups and minorities. Among those in the U.S. delegation are Barbara Leaf, a senior State Department official, and a representative handling cases involving American hostages, including Austin Tice, a journalist abducted in Syria in 2012. In parallel, international discussions have emphasized the need for a non-sectarian, inclusive Syrian government. This was echoed at a recent summit in Aqaba, Jordan, where various regional powers, including Turkey, stressed the importance of maintaining Syria’s territorial integrity. Turkey, which opposed Assad during the war, also voiced concerns about Kurdish forces in Syria, which it considers linked to the PKK, a designated terrorist group. Kurdish-led forces in northeastern Syria, under the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), have been a key player in the region, but their future remains uncertain, especially in the face of Turkish pressure. While Kurdish leaders welcomed the fall of Assad, many fear further Turkish military action in their territories. In Syria itself, protests erupted in response to comments by the interim government, particularly regarding the role of women in politics. A spokesperson for the new government suggested that female representation in ministries or parliament was premature. This sparked outrage, with women leaders vowing to hold the government accountable for any move that undermines gender equality. International bodies, like the UN's migration agency, have also called for increased empowerment of women in Syria’s rebuilding process. The civil war, which claimed over 500,000 lives, has led to widespread displacement and human rights abuses. Following Assad's ousting, mass graves and prisons holding thousands of victims of torture have been uncovered, further highlighting the need for accountability and reconciliation as Syria moves forward.The post US Delegation Holds Talks with al-Jolani in Damascus first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-delegation-talks-al-jolani-damascus/	2024-12-20T08:51:34-08:00	
Turkey, Iran Leaders Hold Talks at Cairo Muslim Summit	The leaders of Turkey and Iran held a meeting in Cairo at a summit involving eight Muslim-majority countries, marking their first direct talks since the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Historically, Turkey and Iran have supported opposing sides in Syria’s prolonged civil war, with Turkey backing the opposition and Iran standing by Assad’s government. During the summit, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan emphasized Turkey’s desire for a stable and secure Syria, where terrorism is eradicated and the country’s territorial integrity is preserved. The Turkish presidency issued a statement in which Erdogan also stressed the importance of maintaining Syria’s unity. Similarly, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian’s office issued a statement underscoring Iran’s position against any threat to Syria’s territorial integrity. He also called for Muslim nations to take a strong stance against Israel's actions in the region. This meeting took place amid a backdrop of regional instability, including the ongoing war in Gaza, a fragile ceasefire in Lebanon, and unrest in Syria. Pezeshkian, addressing the summit, described it as a moral obligation for Muslim countries to act to prevent further harm in conflict zones. The summit, held by the D-8 Organization for Economic Cooperation (also known as the Developing-8), marked the first visit of an Iranian president to Egypt since Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s visit in 2013. Diplomatic relations between Egypt and Iran, which have been strained for years, have recently improved, particularly after Egypt took on a mediator role in the Gaza conflict. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi visited Egypt in October, and Egypt’s Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty had traveled to Tehran earlier in July. This is also Erdogan’s second visit to Egypt this year, with his previous visit in February being his first trip to the country as president since 2012, when he was prime minister.The post Turkey, Iran Leaders Hold Talks at Cairo Muslim Summit first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/turkey-iran-leaders-talks-cairo-muslim-summit/	2024-12-20T08:51:25-08:00	
Israeli Army Withdraws from Bani Hayyan, Lebanese Forces Deploy A...	Israeli forces pulled out of the southern town of Bani Hayyan on Friday, two days after they entered the area. They moved their operations toward Markaba after carrying out demolitions, including bulldozing homes and clearing roads. The Bani Hayyan Municipality reported on Thursday that an elderly woman inside the town had gone missing during the incursion, and her whereabouts remain unclear. In addition to the actions in Bani Hayyan, Israeli forces also conducted detonations in Naqoura, a town in southern Lebanon. Meanwhile, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and the Lebanese Army deployed on Friday in the valleys along the Litani River, between several locations, including Deir Siryan, Alman, al-Qusayr, and Zawtar al-Sharqiyeh. This deployment followed recommendations from the committee overseeing the ceasefire. The Lebanese Army and UNIFIL are setting up checkpoints and other fixed positions at the entrances to the southern Litani sector and along the riverbanks, stretching from Marjayoun to al-Qasmiyeh.The post Israeli Army Withdraws from Bani Hayyan, Lebanese Forces Deploy Along Litani first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-army-withdraws-bani-hayyan/	2024-12-20T08:51:15-08:00	
Army Chief Joseph Aoun: Jumblat’s Pick, Gemayel’s Ally	Former leader of the Progressive Socialist Party, Walid Jumblat, along with the Democratic Gathering bloc, has officially endorsed Army Chief General Joseph Aoun for the upcoming presidential election, set for January 9. Jumblat's announcement makes him one of the first political figures to publicly back a candidate. Jumblat's support for Aoun stems from his belief in the army's crucial role in Lebanon’s stability. He praised Aoun for his leadership, emphasizing that the army is an essential institution for the security and stability of the country. The Lebanese army holds a respected position in Lebanon, known for bridging divides in a politically fragmented society. Recently, the army has played a key role in the implementation of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon, particularly in southern Lebanon, where the Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeepers are now the only armed entities allowed. Hezbollah, a powerful political and military group, has stated that it is cooperating with the army in this effort. The situation is marked by a stark divide: Hezbollah and its ally Amal support a presidential candidate who would protect their influence and maintain Hezbollah's right to defend Lebanon. In contrast, opposition forces advocate for a president who would disarm Hezbollah and ensure that only the Lebanese army is responsible for defending the country and maintaining order, particularly in southern Lebanon, which borders Israel. Kataeb leader Sami Gemayel, speaking on behalf of the opposition, expressed support for a president committed to enforcing the ceasefire agreement and ensuring that only the Lebanese army possesses weapons. However, no opposition candidate has been agreed upon as of yet. The ceasefire, which was brokered by the U.S. and France, calls for the withdrawal of Hezbollah and Israeli forces from southern Lebanon, with the Lebanese army taking full control in the area. This move aims to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which was initially passed in 2006 to end hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel. Resolution 1701 stipulates that the Lebanese state, in partnership with the U.N., should be the exclusive armed presence in the region, a provision that has not been fully enforced until now. Gemayel confirmed that the opposition is still in the process of consulting with each other, but reiterated that they will not announce their presidential candidate until these talks conclude.The post Army Chief Joseph Aoun: Jumblat’s Pick, Gemayel’s Ally first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/joseph-aoun-jumblats-pick-gemayels-ally/	2024-12-20T08:51:08-08:00	
UN Chief Sees Hope in Syria, Urges End to Israeli Strikes	U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed hope for Syria on Thursday, noting a 'flame of hope' following the downfall of President Bashar al-Assad's regime, but also acknowledged the significant hurdles ahead. Guterres emphasized that the Middle East is engulfed in numerous conflicts, yet Syria's situation offers a glimpse of potential progress that must not be extinguished. He also criticized Israel's ongoing air strikes on Syrian military targets, including air force and naval installations, calling them violations of Syria’s sovereignty. He called for an end to these strikes, urging that they must cease immediately. Ahead of a U.N. Security Council meeting, Guterres suggested that the international community consider easing sanctions on Syria as a first step towards fostering solidarity with the Syrian people. However, he noted that this would only be feasible once conditions are in place to remove all sanctions. In Syria, the HTS, an Islamist group with Al-Qaeda roots and support from Turkey, recently seized control of Damascus. They have pledged to protect minorities following the ousting of Assad's government. Despite these changes, the international community remains cautious, hesitant to lift sanctions or take further steps until it is clear how the new authorities will govern the country.The post UN Chief Sees Hope in Syria, Urges End to Israeli Strikes first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/un-hope-syria-urges-end-israeli-strikes/	2024-12-19T10:10:17-08:00	
Israel Hits Yemen Capital After Houthi Missile Targets Central Is...	Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for a missile attack on Israel Thursday, which the Israeli military intercepted before it could reach its territory. Israel responded with airstrikes targeting Houthi infrastructure in Yemen, including power stations, oil facilities, and ports, resulting in casualties. The Houthis, who have repeatedly targeted Israel since the Gaza conflict began, are part of the Iran-backed 'axis of resistance,' which also includes Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu warned that the Houthis would face severe consequences for their actions. He described the group as one of the last remaining arms of Iran's influence, following the weakening of Hezbollah and the fall of the Assad regime in Syria. Israel’s military stated that the intercepted missile was launched from Yemen, triggering sirens in parts of Israel. Israel’s retaliatory strikes reportedly caused significant damage in Yemen, including casualties at Hodeida and Sanaa. While the Iranian government condemned Israel’s actions as a violation of international law, Palestinian militant group Hamas also criticized Israel’s response. This missile interception marked the second this week after a similar incident on Monday, and the Houthis have vowed to continue their operations in support of Palestinians in Gaza. They have previously attacked shipping routes in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, leading to retaliatory strikes by U.S. and British forces. Israeli officials have expressed concerns that the Houthis, supported by Iran, are emerging as a growing global threat.The post Israel Hits Yemen Capital After Houthi Missile Targets Central Israel first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-hits-yemen-capital-houthi-missile/	2024-12-19T10:10:07-08:00	
Latest Updates on Gaza Ceasefire Talks	Efforts to reach a truce and hostage release agreement between Israel and Hamas have encountered multiple challenges, but recent negotiations have sparked hope for a resolution. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed optimism about achieving a ceasefire in Gaza, following a 'cautious optimism' statement from Washington about an 'imminent deal.' These hopes arise from reported indirect negotiations in Qatar, facilitated by Qatar, Egypt, and the United States. Diplomatic sources indicate that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's recent assertion for a deal before his January 20 inauguration has influenced the negotiations. Hamas, feeling isolated due to the weakening of its Lebanese ally Hezbollah and the fall of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, is eager to secure an agreement by year-end. This sentiment is echoed by the hope of many who view a deal as a 'perfect Christmas gift.' The death of Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar has shifted negotiation responsibilities to Hamas leaders abroad, known for their pragmatic approach. According to a high-ranking Hamas official, talks have reached the 'final details' stage, with an announcement expected from Qatar and Egypt once negotiations conclude. An Israeli government spokesman refrained from commenting on the proposed deal, suggesting that keeping details under wraps is beneficial. The proposed deal involves a ceasefire and a phased release of hostages. Initially, Israeli civilian hostages and female soldiers would be released in exchange for numerous Palestinian prisoners. Israel would also partially withdraw its forces from specific areas in Gaza, allowing displaced residents to return under Israeli army monitoring. Subsequent phases would involve the release of Israeli male soldiers, the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from most areas, and the start of reconstruction efforts in Gaza. The Rafah crossing on the Egyptian border would be jointly managed by the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, and the European Union. Despite the progress, significant obstacles remain. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has consistently opposed withdrawing Israeli troops from the Philadelphi Corridor, and Israel has stated it will not allow Hamas to govern Gaza post-war. Additionally, the governance of Gaza remains a contentious issue within the Palestinian leadership. While a Hamas official mentioned that international entities would guarantee the agreement's implementation, there has been no confirmation from these parties.The post Latest Updates on Gaza Ceasefire Talks first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/latest-updates-gaza-ceasefire-talks/	2024-12-19T10:09:56-08:00	
Aoun Only Serious Candidate for January Session	The Democratic Gathering bloc has become the first to officially declare its presidential candidate ahead of the election session set for January 9. This session may potentially conclude over two years of presidential vacancy. On Wednesday, following a meeting, the Democratic Gathering bloc announced that its MPs would vote for Army chief Gen. Joseph Aoun on January 9. Former Progressive Socialist Party leader Walid Jumblat, who attended the meeting, had previously met with Speaker Nabih Berri and tried to persuade him to support Aoun. However, these efforts, as well as attempts to convince Free Patriotic Movement leader Jebran Bassil, were unsuccessful. According to MTV, Berri's reservations about Aoun stem from his 'sharp' character and 'sectarian approach,' rather than his ties to the U.S. Joseph Aoun, considered a strong candidate for the presidency, faces the challenge of enforcing the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire, a task heavily dependent on his troops' deployment in the south. Despite difficulties, Aoun is seen as a figure of personal integrity and national dedication, respected for his leadership in driving out the Islamic State from the Syrian border region. He has led the army since 2017, with his mandate extended twice, and maintains good relations across the political spectrum, including with Hezbollah and foreign countries. Although various politicians and parties have suggested Aoun as a presidential candidate, only the Democratic Gathering bloc has officially endorsed him for the January 9 session. Opposition blocs have considered other candidates like Michel Mouawad, Jihad Azour, Salah Honein, Neemat Frem, and Nassif Hitti, with Azour being their latest official candidate. Hezbollah and Amal have consistently backed Suleiman Franjieh. The opposition remains undecided on its candidate for January 9.
