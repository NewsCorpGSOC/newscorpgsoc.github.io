Breaking: Hezbollah Hits Safad; Israel Reports 5 Soldiers Killed ...	Hezbollah announced on Friday that it launched a drone assault on a military base in northern Israel, near the border, following earlier claims of rocket fire targeting the same region. According to Hezbollah’s statement, the attack involved 'explosives-laden drones' aimed at the base east of Safad, and shortly before, the group said it had fired 'a salvo of rockets' at the town. Overnight, Israeli warplanes carried out airstrikes on several locations in Beirut’s southern suburbs, including Choueifat, Hadath, Haret Hreik, and Borj al-Barajneh. Five Israeli Soldiers Killed in Southern Lebanon On Friday, the Israeli army reported that five soldiers were killed and two severely injured in combat in southern Lebanon. This brings the total of Israeli soldiers killed in Lebanon to 32 since the ground operation began on September 30. Rocket Attack Injures Three in Israel’s Majd Al-Krum A rocket attack from Lebanon critically injured three people in Israel’s northern town of Majd Al-Krum, including two men, both aged 21, and a 35-year-old woman. Israeli rescue services reported that six others were injured, including an 80-year-old man in serious condition. According to Israel’s military, the rocket barrage hit a gym in Majd Al-Krum, while 45 projectiles were fired from Lebanon; some were intercepted, while others landed in open areas. Israeli Strikes in Eastern Lebanon Result in 12 Fatalities, Including Three Children On Thursday, Israeli airstrikes in eastern Lebanon killed 12 people, including three children, in two villages. Seven individuals, among them the children, were killed in an airstrike on Al-Khodr village in the Baalbek-Hermel region, with five others killed in another nearby attack. Health Workers and Hospitals Impacted by Israeli Strikes Lebanon’s caretaker Health Minister, Firas Abiad, reported Friday that Israeli strikes over the past year have damaged 55 hospitals, with 36 directly hit, resulting in 12 deaths and 60 injuries. Eight hospitals have been forced to shut down, while seven remain partially functional. Abiad emphasized that paramedics have also been targeted, with 151 deaths and 272 injuries reported among rescue workers. He claimed Israel’s military has prevented recovery of eight paramedics in southern Lebanon, stating that such actions are deliberate attacks on medical personnel, constituting a 'war crime.' Israeli Strike Closes Lebanon-Syria Border Crossing An Israeli airstrike on Friday hit a border crossing between Lebanon and Syria in Qaa, marking the third such border crossing closure. This leaves only three functioning border routes. Previously, an October 5 Israeli airstrike left a large crater on the Lebanese side of the Masnaa crossing, the busiest border route between Lebanon and Syria. In late September, another Israeli airstrike forced the closure of the Matraba crossing in Lebanon’s northeast.The post Breaking: Hezbollah Hits Safad; Israel Reports 5 Soldiers Killed in South Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-hits-safad-israel-5-soldiers-killed-lebanon/	2024-10-25T08:26:44-07:00	
Blinken Meets Mikati, Urges ‘Diplomatic Resolution’ in Lebanon	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken pledged on Friday to push urgently for a diplomatic solution to end Israel's ongoing offensive in Lebanon but emphasized that securing an agreement on Hezbollah's disarmament is essential. During a meeting with Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati in London, Blinken stressed the need for civilian protections but stopped short of calling for an immediate ceasefire. The U.S. remains a key diplomatic and military backer of Israel. 'We’re approaching this with a sense of real urgency to reach a diplomatic solution and fully implement U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, to ensure lasting security along the Israel-Lebanon border,' Blinken told reporters, noting he was 'intensely engaged' in these efforts. Resolution 1701, adopted in 2006 after a previous conflict, calls for the disarmament of non-state forces in Lebanon—primarily referring to Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Shiite group that maintains its own military—and for Israel's full withdrawal from Lebanon. Blinken highlighted the need to establish conditions that allow full implementation of the resolution, adding, 'The sooner we secure these understandings, the sooner we can reach a resolution.' He urged efforts to safeguard civilians and Lebanese soldiers, at least 11 of whom have died since the Israeli offensive began a month ago. 'It’s important that in places like Beirut, real measures are taken to protect civilians and avoid unnecessary harm,' he said. The U.S. has advocated for strengthening Lebanon’s central government and its military to assume full responsibility for security, reducing Hezbollah’s influence. Prime Minister Mikati, who was in Paris on Thursday for a Lebanon support conference, reaffirmed that only Lebanon’s state and army should bear arms. Jordan’s Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi, also meeting with Blinken, noted Lebanon’s government has committed to upholding Resolution 1701, adding, 'The aggression against Lebanon must stop immediately. There’s no justification for its continuation.'The post Blinken Meets Mikati, Urges ‘Diplomatic Resolution’ in Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/blinken-mikati-urges-diplomatic-resolution-lebanon/	2024-10-25T08:25:54-07:00	
UK Delivers Critical Food and Medical Aid to Lebanese Army	The UK has supplied over 12,500 ration packs and 79 battlefield medical kits to support the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF), delivered by the RAF and funded by the UK’s Integrated Security Fund. The British Embassy in Beirut highlighted the importance of the LAF, noting its role as the sole legitimate military force in Lebanon and a crucial element for the country’s security. The UK has provided critical support to the LAF for over a decade, including training more than 34,000 personnel and investing over £106 million in the force. Additionally, the UK has assisted in building nearly 80 border observation posts and operating bases to strengthen Lebanon's border security. British officials, including the Prime Minister, Foreign Secretary, and Defense Secretary, are also calling for an immediate ceasefire and increased humanitarian aid in Lebanon and Gaza to facilitate a political solution. The UK has urged British nationals to leave Lebanon, arranging charter flights to assist in their safe departure. Defense Secretary John Healey commented, 'This RAF supply delivery is a direct response to the LAF's request, supporting Lebanon's stability as part of our peace efforts in the region.' Foreign Secretary David Lammy emphasized, 'This support reflects our commitment to Lebanon’s legitimate armed forces, which are essential for stability in the region. We are also pressing for a ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel and a political approach consistent with U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701.' In response to increased displacement and civilian impact, the UK has allocated an additional £10 million for humanitarian assistance in Lebanon. This is in addition to a £5 million package delivered through UNICEF for essential services and public donations matched by the UK government for the DEC Middle East Humanitarian Appeal up to £10 million. The British Embassy reaffirmed the UK's commitment to peace in the Middle East and called for de-escalation, advocating for a ceasefire to enable civilians to return safely to their homes.The post UK Delivers Critical Food and Medical Aid to Lebanese Army first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/uk-delivers-food-medical-aid-lebanese-army/	2024-10-25T08:25:43-07:00	
Breaking: 3 TV Staffers Killed in Israeli Strike on Journalist Co...	An Israeli airstrike targeting a compound in southeast Lebanon, where journalists were stationed, led to the deaths of three media workers, according to Lebanon’s National News Agency on Friday. Footage from local news channel Al-Jadeed showed buildings reduced to rubble and dust-covered vehicles marked 'PRESS.' Reports indicate that the Israeli army did not issue a warning before the airstrike, which struck a cluster of chalets rented by various media organizations. The pan-Arab channel Al-Mayadeen, based in Beirut, confirmed that two of its journalists, Ghassan Najjar and Mohammad Reda, were killed in the attack early Friday. Al-Manar TV also reported the death of its cameraman, Wissam Qassem. The strike occurred in Hasbaya, an area that had largely avoided previous clashes along the border. Since near-daily skirmishes began along the Lebanon-Israel border on October 8, 2023, several journalists have lost their lives.The post Breaking: 3 TV Staffers Killed in Israeli Strike on Journalist Compound in Hasbaya first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/3-tv-staffers-killed-israeli-strike-compound-hasbaya/	2024-10-25T00:51:27-07:00	
Lebanon Aid Conference Secures $1 Billion	At a conference held in Paris on Thursday focused on providing aid to crisis-hit Lebanon, approximately $800 million was raised for humanitarian support, alongside an additional $200 million earmarked for the country's armed forces, according to French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot. 'We have met the challenge,' Barrot stated at the conference's conclusion. However, he emphasized that 'we cannot limit ourselves to humanitarian and security measures alone&#8230; a diplomatic solution is essential,' as tensions between Israel and Hezbollah persist.The post Lebanon Aid Conference Secures $1 Billion first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lebanon-aid-conference-secures-1-billion/	2024-10-25T00:50:48-07:00	
Hezbollah Strikes Safad and Israeli Base Near Haifa	Hezbollah announced on Thursday that it had struck an Israeli military installation near Haifa for the second time in 24 hours. In a statement, the group claimed its fighters 'bombed' a defense industry base 'north of Haifa' with a series of rockets. Additionally, Hezbollah reported launching a 'large rocket barrage' targeting the northern Israeli town of Safad. This attack, according to Hezbollah, was carried out 'in response to Israeli enemy attacks' on Lebanon.The post Hezbollah Strikes Safad and Israeli Base Near Haifa first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-strikes-safad-israeli-base-haifa/	2024-10-25T00:50:26-07:00	
Pentagon Chief Expresses ‘Deep Concern’ Over Israeli Strikes on L...	U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has voiced 'deep concern' to Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over recent strikes on Lebanon’s military, following the deaths of three Lebanese soldiers over the weekend. Lebanon’s army reported on Sunday that an Israeli strike had hit a military vehicle in southern Lebanon, where Israel has been targeting positions associated with Hezbollah, supported by Iran. This incident raised Lebanese troop casualties to eight since conflict between Israel and Hezbollah intensified last month. During a call with Gallant on Wednesday, Austin conveyed his concerns about the reported strikes on Lebanese military forces, according to Pentagon spokesperson Major General Pat Ryder. Austin stressed the need to prioritize the safety of both Lebanese Armed Forces and U.N. peacekeepers in Lebanon, also known as UNIFIL, which has reported multiple recent strikes from Israel. Austin further expressed condolences for the death of Israeli brigade commander Colonel Ahsan Daksa in northern Gaza. The Israeli military reported that Colonel Daksa was killed by an explosive device while exiting his tank in the Jabalia area on Sunday.The post Pentagon Chief Expresses ‘Deep Concern’ Over Israeli Strikes on Lebanese Army first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/pentagon-deep-concern-israeli-strikes-lebanese-army/	2024-10-25T00:50:05-07:00	
Israel Claims Aid Worker Killed in Strike Was Hamas Commander	Israeli officials have claimed that a UN aid worker killed in central Gaza, Mohammad Abu Etewi, was also a Hamas commander. According to Israel's Defense Forces (IDF) and the Israeli Security Agency, Abu Etewi was allegedly involved in the October 7 attack in Re’im, southern Israel, targeting civilians and abducting hostages. Israel further claimed that, as the conflict continued, he directed assaults on IDF forces. An UNRWA spokesperson confirmed that Abu Etewi’s name appeared on an Israeli-provided list of UNRWA employees allegedly linked to Hamas, but the agency said it has yet to receive further evidence from Israel despite its request for additional details. Israeli authorities also released images that they claim show Abu Etewi participating in the October 7 attack, though CNN could not independently verify these photos. Meanwhile, Abu Etewi’s family members told CNN he was uninvolved in any militant activities, describing him as a UN employee focused on transporting aid to those in need. His father, Marwan Abu Etewi, stated that Mohammad was not a fighter and had no ties to Hamas.The post Israel Claims Aid Worker Killed in Strike Was Hamas Commander first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-aid-worker-killed-strike-hamas-commander/	2024-10-25T00:49:54-07:00	
Mikati Calls for Immediate Ceasefire, 8,000 Troops Deployed in So...	On Thursday, caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati called for an immediate ceasefire and the full enforcement of the U.N. resolution that ended the last conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. He also proposed deploying 8,000 Lebanese troops to a buffer zone along the Israeli border. Speaking at a conference in Paris in support of Lebanon, Mikati emphasized the devastating toll the ongoing war has taken on Lebanon, describing the widespread destruction and human suffering it has caused. 'The Israeli aggression has resulted in immense human loss and has severely damaged our infrastructure, economy, and social fabric,' he stated. Mikati expressed regret that civilian lives and destruction could have been avoided if Israel had agreed to the joint statement issued on September 25. He reiterated Lebanon’s call for an immediate ceasefire and urged the deployment of Lebanese forces south of the Litani River to enforce peace. 'What Lebanon needs most today is an instant ceasefire, and we are counting on your pressure to make this happen,' he told the international community. Though the Lebanese Army has largely stayed out of the latest conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, it claims Israeli forces have targeted its soldiers eight times, resulting in deaths and injuries. Israel apologized for a fatal strike on Sunday. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, called for the withdrawal of Hezbollah and Israeli forces from areas south of Lebanon’s Litani River, leaving control to the Lebanese Army and U.N. peacekeepers. Israel has argued that the resolution was never fully enforced, accusing Hezbollah of building military infrastructure up to the border. Lebanon, in turn, has criticized Israel for violating provisions like infringing on its airspace. The Lebanese Army has around 80,000 personnel, with about 5,000 stationed in the south. Representing the army at the Paris conference, Brig. Gen. Youssef Haddad said Lebanon is recruiting an additional 1,500 soldiers to help implement the U.N. resolution. Hezbollah, which boasts tens of thousands of fighters, remains a powerful force, and Lebanon’s military lacks the strength to confront the group or resist an Israeli ground invasion.The post Mikati Calls for Immediate Ceasefire, 8,000 Troops Deployed in South first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/mikati-calls-ceasefire-8000-troops-deployed-south/	2024-10-24T05:05:08-07:00

In a statement, Hezbollah said its fighters 'bombed' a 'defense industry' base located north of Haifa with a barrage of rockets, following a similar attack on the same site the previous day. The group also stated it launched a 'large rocket salvo' at the northern Israeli town of Safad on Thursday. According to Hezbollah, this attack was carried out 'in response to Israeli enemy attacks' on Lebanon.The post Breaking: Hezbollah Strikes Safad and Israeli Base Near Haifa first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-strikes-safad-israeli-base-near-haifa/	2024-10-24T05:04:41-07:00	
Egypt, US, Qatar Discuss Limited Gaza Ceasefire and Hostage Relea...	Egypt has floated the idea of a temporary halt in fighting, during which Hamas could release a few hostages and humanitarian aid could be increased, particularly in northern Gaza, according to an Egyptian official who spoke to The Associated Press. The official, who requested anonymity due to not being authorized to speak to the media, noted that Egypt and Qatar had discussed the plan with the United States, although it has not yet become a concrete proposal. Both Israel and Hamas are reportedly aware of these discussions. A senior official from the U.S. State Department confirmed that the notion of a limited hostage release has been raised recently, but no final decision has been made, even following U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's meetings with Israeli officials and hostage families. As of now, neither Israel nor Hamas has commented on the proposal. Historically, Hamas has dismissed similar suggestions, maintaining its focus on achieving an end to the war. The group is still holding around 100 hostages from its October 7, 2023, attack, with approximately a third believed to be deceased.The post Egypt, US, Qatar Discuss Limited Gaza Ceasefire and Hostage Release first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/egypt-us-qatar-limited-gaza-ceasefire-hostage-release/	2024-10-24T01:27:08-07:00	
Israel Claims Iran Strike Would Prove Military Readiness	Israel's defense minister, Yoav Gallant, addressed a group of air force pilots on Wednesday, stating that an Israeli strike on Iran would showcase the 'preparation and readiness' of the nation's air force. 'After we carry out an attack in Iran, both within Israel and elsewhere, people will understand the extent of your preparation and readiness,' Gallant said while speaking to pilots and operators at the Hatzerim airbase in southern Israel. He emphasized that the Air Force plays a crucial role, warning that 'anyone who tries to harm us will be harmed.' This statement is the latest indication from Israeli leadership that the country is preparing to respond forcefully to Iran following the ballistic missile attack on Israel on October 1. Israel's potential options for retaliation range from symbolic strikes on military sites to more significant actions, such as targeting Iran’s vital oil infrastructure or its closely guarded nuclear program. U.S. President Joe Biden has advised Israel against such extensive actions.The post Israel Claims Iran Strike Would Prove Military Readiness first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-iran-strike-prove-military-readiness/	2024-10-24T01:26:58-07:00	
Israel Prepared for Multi-Front War Lasting ‘Months’	The Israeli army is ready to continue its operations in Gaza and Lebanon for an extended period, potentially lasting months, according to a senior Israeli security official on Wednesday during a media briefing. 'We are prepared for months, and we will remain for as long as necessary to ensure Israel's security,' the source said, referring to the ongoing military activities in both regions. Israel has also pledged to respond to a missile attack by Iran earlier this month. The official emphasized that Israel is not waging a conventional war against Gaza or Lebanon but rather confronting militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah, both backed by Iran. 'This is a war against Iran, sometimes directly and sometimes indirectly, through its proxies,' the source explained. The Israeli military claims to have 'eliminated the entire command structure' of Hamas and Hezbollah and significantly reduced their military strength. The conflict in Gaza began with Hamas' attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, reportedly resulting in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli figures. In response, Israel's retaliatory strikes have caused 42,792 fatalities in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry. Last month, Israel escalated its operations in Lebanon following cross-border rocket attacks by Hezbollah in support of Hamas. The Israeli government has committed to securing its northern border to facilitate the return of displaced Israelis. Since October 7, 29 Israeli soldiers have been killed in confrontations with Hezbollah, while 358 have died in Gaza. The security official stated that Israel's goal is to weaken these militant groups as much as possible. In Gaza, the operation is largely focused on counter-insurgency efforts, with Hamas reportedly having around 1,000 fighters and up to 100 rockets capable of reaching Tel Aviv, though these figures have not been independently verified. Israel has intensified airstrikes on Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon and deployed ground forces. The ongoing conflict has led to the deaths of at least 1,552 people in Lebanon since September 23, according to Lebanese health ministry figures. Despite the military actions, Israel hopes for a more stable Lebanon after the conflict. The source cited U.N. Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah and called for the Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeepers to take control of areas near the Israeli border. Israel supports enforcing this resolution but insists on the ability to ensure its implementation. The situation in Gaza, the source noted, remains more complicated, and the Israeli army will continue its operations 'for as long as necessary' until security is guaranteed. Only then will Israel consider its next steps.The post Israel Prepared for Multi-Front War Lasting ‘Months’ first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-prepared-multi-front-war-lasting-months/	2024-10-24T01:26:47-07:00	
Geagea: Hochstein Proposals Violate Sovereignty, Gov’t Must Enfor...	Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea on Wednesday urged the government to publicly affirm its commitment to U.N. resolutions, particularly Resolution 1559, to prevent the situation in Lebanon from worsening. He also expressed concerns that some of the proposals by U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein infringe on Lebanon's sovereignty. In an interview with Al-Arabiya, Geagea stated that 'the ongoing conflict in Lebanon is essentially between Israel and Iran,' and called on the government to actively implement U.N. Resolutions 1559, 1680, and 1701, rather than simply committing to them. Geagea criticized Speaker Nabih Berri and caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati, accusing them of resisting the implementation of Resolutions 1559 and 1680, and only making superficial efforts regarding Resolution 1701. He stressed that this is no time for political maneuvering and urged the government to fulfill the terms of the Taif Agreement. 'Lebanon is at a critical juncture, and we need courageous and decisive action,' Geagea emphasized. He also revealed that both Berri and Mikati are reluctant to demand that Hezbollah disarm, and shared that he had advised the prime minister months ago to confront Hezbollah and warn them about the potential for war. Geagea further suggested that had the Lebanese Army been positioned at the border, Israel might not have launched its attacks on Lebanon.The post Geagea: Hochstein Proposals Violate Sovereignty, Gov’t Must Enforce Resolution 1559 first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hochstein-violate-sovereignty-govt-enforce-resolution-1559/	2024-10-24T01:26:21-07:00	
Western Diplomat: Foreign Troops Possible in Lebanon Post-Truce	Western nations are discussing the possibility of deploying international forces to Lebanon alongside the country's military in the event of a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, according to a Western diplomat on Wednesday. Currently, around 10,000 United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) peacekeepers are stationed in southern Lebanon, but there are considerations for a separate multinational force to be deployed. 'What is needed now is a ceasefire and a presence that both sides trust. This could involve the Lebanese army with international forces,' the diplomat told AFP, under the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue. Lebanon’s allies have been supporting the Lebanese army and are exploring how they can provide further assistance in the context of a ceasefire and a long-term diplomatic solution, the diplomat added. Following nearly a year of conflict with Hamas in Gaza, Israel shifted its attention to Lebanon last month, aiming to secure its northern border amidst ongoing attacks from Hezbollah. Israel has intensified airstrikes on Hezbollah strongholds and deployed ground forces. The U.N. Security Council’s Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, called for the deployment of only Lebanese government forces and UNIFIL peacekeepers in southern Lebanon. However, it has faced criticism for limited implementation. Lebanese media have reported discussions about strengthening the resolution, with some referring to the potential plan as '1701-plus.' During a visit to Beirut on Monday, U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein emphasized that merely committing to Resolution 1701 would not be sufficient, suggesting the need for additional measures to ensure its proper implementation. The Western diplomat said that the push for a '1701-plus' reflects the fact that neither side has fully implemented the original resolution. Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati has also expressed Lebanon's readiness to strengthen the army's presence in the south after a ceasefire is reached. UNIFIL, established in 1978 to monitor the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon, has recently accused Israel of repeatedly and deliberately targeting its positions. Hezbollah, formed after Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, is the only group that retained its weapons after Lebanon's civil war (1975-1990), claiming its arms are necessary for resisting Israel. A previous U.N.-mandated multinational force, including troops from the U.S. and France, was deployed to Lebanon after the 1982 Israeli invasion. However, it was targeted in two deadly attacks that claimed nearly 300 lives.The post Western Diplomat: Foreign Troops Possible in Lebanon Post-Truce first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/foreign-troops-possible-lebanon-post-truce/	2024-10-24T01:25:47-07:00	
Netanyahu Accuses Hezbollah of Planning Israel Invasion	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed on Wednesday that Israel had uncovered a Hezbollah plot to launch a large-scale assault on the country, using underground tunnels equipped with jeeps and missiles. Speaking to French broadcasters CNews and Europe 1, Netanyahu explained that the plan, if carried out, would have been more devastating than the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023. Netanyahu described how the Israeli military discovered tunnels just 100-200 meters from the border, intended for an invasion of Israel. The tunnels were part of a plan to infiltrate Israel using motorbikes, jeeps, rockets, and missiles. 'They were preparing an attack greater than what we saw on October 7,' Netanyahu said, according to the networks' translation. Earlier this month, Netanyahu had also told *Le Figaro* that the Israeli military had found advanced Russian military equipment among Hezbollah’s arms stockpiles. Since Israel escalated its offensive in Lebanon last month, including airstrikes and ground operations, the conflict has resulted in at least 1,552 deaths, based on Lebanese health ministry figures, though the actual number is likely higher.The post Netanyahu Accuses Hezbollah of Planning Israel Invasion first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/netanyahu-hezbollah-planning-israel-invasion/	2024-10-24T01:25:13-07:00	
Israel Flattens Residential Complex in Dahieh Strikes	Israel launched a series of airstrikes on Hezbollah’s stronghold in southern Beirut on Wednesday night, destroying a residential complex, according to Lebanese state media. The attacks occurred after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, during his visit to Israel, urged the country to avoid further escalating tensions with Iran. Israel is engaged in conflicts with Iran-backed Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, and has vowed to retaliate against Iran following a missile attack on October 1. In Lebanon, the National News Agency (NNA) reported that at least 10 Israeli strikes targeted Beirut’s southern suburbs, following an evacuation warning from the Israeli army. Four of those strikes hit a residential complex near Laylaki, completely destroying it and causing a massive fire. In southern Lebanon, the city of Tyre was heavily bombarded by Israeli airstrikes, leaving large parts of the city center in ruins and triggering a mass exodus. Tyre’s disaster management unit reported that seven buildings were flattened, with over 400 apartments damaged. 'The whole city shook,' said one resident, with black smoke seen rising from several neighborhoods, including areas close to the city’s ancient ruins. UNESCO expressed concern and said it is closely monitoring the impact of the conflict on Tyre’s World Heritage site. Blinken’s visit to the region, his 11th since the Gaza war began, is part of ongoing U.S. efforts to contain the conflict and limit its wider regional implications. He emphasized to Israel that while they have achieved many of their strategic goals in Gaza, it’s crucial they avoid actions that could cause further escalation. The war in Gaza began after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, resulting in the deaths of 1,206 people, mainly civilians, according to Israeli figures. Israel’s retaliation has claimed 42,792 lives in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the health ministry of Gaza, a figure considered reliable by the U.N. Blinken also touched on Israel’s promise to retaliate for Iran's attack on October 1, urging Israel to respond in a way that does not exacerbate tensions. Following his visit to Israel, Blinken traveled to Saudi Arabia in an effort to continue working on a potential diplomatic breakthrough between Israel and the Arab world. In a separate development, Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian called for BRICS nations to help bring an end to the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon during a summit in Russia. Meanwhile, a Hamas delegation arrived in Moscow for talks. Concerns are also mounting for civilians in northern Gaza, where aid remains scarce and the Israeli offensive is ongoing. Displaced Gazans are struggling with cold as winter approaches, with many living in makeshift shelters. Additionally, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed on Wednesday that Hezbollah had been planning a large-scale attack on Israel, similar to Hamas’ assault on October 7, involving jeeps, missiles, and tunnels. Netanyahu said Israel had uncovered the plot in time. Hezbollah confirmed the death of a key cleric, Hashem Safieddine, who had been expected to succeed the group’s current leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. Safieddine’s death was reported a day after the Israeli army announced his demise. There are also discussions among Western diplomats about deploying international forces to Lebanon if a ceasefire is reached. Currently, about 10,000 U.N. peacekeepers are stationed in southern Lebanon, but additional multinational troops are being considered.The post Israel Flattens Residential Complex in Dahieh Strikes first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-flattens-residential-complex-dahieh-strikes/	2024-10-24T01:24:50-07:00

Germany FM Urges Diplomatic Solution During Beirut Visit	German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has called for a diplomatic resolution to the ongoing conflict between Hezbollah and Israel. Upon arriving in Beirut on Wednesday, Baerbock emphasized the need to collaborate with partners in the U.S., Europe, and the Arab world to develop a viable diplomatic solution that addresses the security concerns of both Israel and Lebanon. She warned that a full destabilization of Lebanon would be disastrous for the Middle East's most religiously diverse country and the broader region. Baerbock expressed concern about Lebanon's fragile state, describing the country as 'on the brink of collapse.' She also urged all parties involved in the conflict to ensure the safety of United Nations peacekeepers stationed along the Israeli-Lebanese border, stating that 'any deliberate attack on U.N. peacekeepers violates international humanitarian law.'

Israeli Drone Strikes Hit Southern City of Tyre	Lebanese state media reported an Israeli drone strike on a street in Tyre on Wednesday, following warnings from the Israeli army for residents to evacuate large areas of the southern city. According to the National News Agency, 'an enemy drone targeted' a street in Tyre. AFPTV footage captured thick black smoke rising from the city. Earlier that day, Lebanese civilians fled Tyre after the Israeli army issued evacuation warnings ahead of planned military operations. Israeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee shared a map on the social media platform X, highlighting the affected streets and urging residents to 'immediately move out of the area marked in red and head north of the Awali River.' He warned that anyone near Hezbollah members, facilities, or combat equipment was putting their life at risk.The post Israeli Drone Strikes Hit Southern City of Tyre first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-drone-strikes-hit-southern-city-tyre/	2024-10-23T02:47:09-07:00	
Projectiles Intercepted Near Blinken’s Tel Aviv Hotel as Hezbolla...	Air raid sirens sounded across Tel Aviv on Wednesday as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken prepared to conclude his visit. Smoke, likely from an intercepted projectile, was visible in the sky above the hotel where Blinken was staying. Hezbollah claimed responsibility for firing rockets at an Israeli military intelligence base located in the suburbs of Tel Aviv, following overnight strikes on southern Beirut. In a statement, Hezbollah said its fighters launched a 'rocket salvo' at the Glilot base, which has been targeted multiple times in recent days. The group stated the attack was 'in response to the Zionist enemy's attacks and massacres.' On Tuesday, Hezbollah also launched attack drones targeting an Israeli military base near Haifa and claimed responsibility for striking seven Israeli tanks—five inside Lebanese territory and two across the northern Israeli border.The post Projectiles Intercepted Near Blinken’s Tel Aviv Hotel as Hezbollah Strikes Suburbs first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/projectiles-intercepted-blinkens-tel-aviv-hotel/	2024-10-23T02:46:50-07:00	
10 Dead, 31 Injured in Strikes on Hermel and Nabatiyeh	Two Israeli airstrikes on Tuesday evening resulted in the deaths of at least 10 people in southern and northeastern Lebanon as Israel continues its offensive against Hezbollah targets. According to two separate statements from the ministry, five people were killed and 10 others injured in the northeastern Hermel region near the Syrian border. In another strike, five more were killed and 21 wounded in the southern city of Nabatiyeh, which has been subjected to Israeli attacks for several days.The post 10 Dead, 31 Injured in Strikes on Hermel and Nabatiyeh first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/10-dead-31-injured-strikes-hermel-nabatiyeh/	2024-10-23T02:45:45-07:00	
Breaking: Israel Confirms Safieddine’s Death	The Israeli military announced on Tuesday that one of its airstrikes near Beirut earlier this month had killed a senior Hezbollah official, Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, who was widely regarded as the likely successor to the group’s leadership. Hezbollah has not yet confirmed the death of Safieddine, a prominent cleric within the organization. He was expected to take over leadership following the death of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, one of Hezbollah’s founders, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike in September. According to Israel, Safieddine was killed in an airstrike in early October in a southern suburb of Beirut, along with around 25 other Hezbollah leaders. Recent Israeli strikes have decimated much of Hezbollah's top leadership, causing significant disruption within the organization.The post Breaking: Israel Confirms Safieddine’s Death first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-confirms-safieddines-death/	2024-10-23T02:40:32-07:00	
Watch: France Defends Ban on Israeli Arms Firms, Denies Boycott C...	On Tuesday, the French government defended its decision to prohibit Israeli companies involved in supplying weapons for the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East from exhibiting at an upcoming trade fair near Paris. The naval defense exhibition, Euronaval, scheduled for November 4-7, stated on its website that Israeli firms are allowed to participate, but only if their products are not being used in military operations in Gaza and Lebanon. The organizers said these restrictions were based on decisions made by the French government earlier this month. Speaking to parliament on Tuesday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot clarified that this policy does not equate to a boycott of Israeli companies. However, he explained that it would be inconsistent for France to promote weapons used in these conflicts while simultaneously advocating for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon. Barrot added that the French government has communicated this stance to Israeli authorities, emphasizing that Israeli companies could still participate in the exhibition if their products are not used in the offensive actions in those regions. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, in a post on social media platform X on Sunday, called on French President Emmanuel Macron to reverse the restrictions, describing them as 'unacceptable' and 'anti-democratic.' Katz urged France and the Western world to support Israel rather than oppose it. Despite this, Barrot reaffirmed France’s support for Israel’s right to self-defense. He pointed to France’s continued export of components used in Israel’s 'Iron Dome' air-defense system. However, he stressed that it would be inconsistent to promote weapons used in Gaza and Lebanon, which have caused significant civilian casualties, while France calls for an immediate ceasefire.The post Watch: France Defends Ban on Israeli Arms Firms, Denies Boycott Claims first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/france-defends-ban-israeli-arms-firms-denies-boycott/	2024-10-23T02:39:04-07:00	
Lufthansa Extends Beirut Flight Suspension Until February	German airline Lufthansa announced on Wednesday that it will extend its suspension of flights to Beirut until the end of February due to the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Lufthansa had initially suspended its flights to Beirut until November 30 but has now pushed the suspension further. Additionally, the airline revealed that its flights to Tehran, Iran, will also remain suspended until the end of January, extending the original halt that was set to expire on October 31.The post Lufthansa Extends Beirut Flight Suspension Until February first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lufthansa-extends-beirut-flight-suspension-until-february/	2024-10-23T02:35:23-07:00

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Tel Aviv on Tuesday for discussions with Israeli officials as the U.S. continues its efforts to push for a diplomatic resolution to the growing conflict in the Middle East. This marks Blinken’s 11th trip to the region since war broke out last year, and he arrives at a pivotal moment. Israel is preparing its expected response to an Iranian missile attack, while ceasefire negotiations over the conflicts in Lebanon and Gaza seem to have stalled. The visit also comes amid tension between Washington and its key regional ally, Israel. The U.S. has warned that it may halt weapons supplies unless the humanitarian conditions in Gaza improve. Relations were further tested following a recent U.S. intelligence leak regarding Israel’s war strategies. However, the State Department indicated on Monday that the leak would likely not be a topic of discussion during Blinken's meetings. On Monday, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby expressed doubts that ceasefire talks related to Gaza or Lebanon would resume soon. Meanwhile, Iran's mission to the United Nations issued a statement on Monday, warning that the U.S. would be 'complicit' in any Israeli actions against Iran if it supports Israel with advanced weaponry, highlighting the rising tensions in the region.The post Blinken Lands in Tel Aviv as Israeli Strike on Iran Looms, Ceasefire Talks Stall first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/blinken-tel-aviv-israeli-strike-iran/	2024-10-22T03:14:01-07:00	
Casualties Rise After Israeli Strike Near Beirut Hospital	The death toll has climbed to 13, including a child, following an Israeli airstrike near a hospital on the outskirts of Beirut, Lebanon's health ministry reported on Tuesday. The ministry also stated that the number of people injured in the attack, which took place outside the Rafik Hariri University Hospital—Lebanon's largest public hospital—has risen to 57. Of those injured, 17 were admitted to the hospital, with seven in critical condition. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the strike targeted what they described as a 'Hezbollah terrorist site' near the hospital on Monday. According to a CNN analysis, the location of the strike was outside the areas that had been subject to evacuation orders issued by the Israeli military.The post Casualties Rise After Israeli Strike Near Beirut Hospital first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/casualties-rise-israeli-strike-beirut-hospital/	2024-10-22T03:13:51-07:00	
Police Attempt to Evict Hundreds from Abandoned Hamra Building	Police in Beirut's Hamra commercial district forcibly entered an abandoned building on Monday to evict hundreds of people displaced by the ongoing war with Israel. These individuals had been squatting in the building for several weeks. Lebanese authorities have established numerous shelters to house the displaced population, but the sheer volume of people—now reaching nearly 20% of the population, or around 1.2 million—has overwhelmed the available facilities. Many fled their homes following an Israeli escalation last month, adding to the hundreds of thousands already displaced from southern Lebanon, Bekaa, and the southern suburbs of Beirut. Many of these people fled with nothing but the clothes on their backs. Government-run shelters, which are currently housing close to 200,000 people, are operating at full capacity. While some displaced individuals have found refuge with friends and family, many others have resorted to setting up temporary shelters on beaches and in open spaces. With winter fast approaching, they are increasingly desperate to find proper shelter. During the eviction, clashes erupted between the police and some of the displaced people who refused to leave the building. One person collapsed and had to be transported by ambulance, while a woman threatened to jump off the balcony, fearing the overcrowded government shelters where she believed conditions were unsafe and disease-ridden. The sudden eviction was unexpected, and its exact cause remains unclear. However, Lebanon's Interior Ministry stated that it would not permit the unauthorized occupation of private property, even amidst the ongoing displacement crisis.The post Police Attempt to Evict Hundreds from Abandoned Hamra Building first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/police-evict-hundreds-abandoned-hamra-building/	2024-10-22T02:45:40-07:00	
Israel Submits War-Ending Demands to U.S.	Last week, Israel provided the U.S. with a document outlining its conditions for a diplomatic solution to end the conflict in Lebanon and facilitate the return of displaced civilians on both sides of the border, according to two U.S. and two Israeli officials who spoke to Axios. Israeli officials said the Prime Minister's Office shared the document with the White House ahead of President Joe Biden's envoy, Amos Hochstein, traveling to Beirut on Monday to discuss a diplomatic resolution. The document was sent to Hochstein by Israeli Minister for Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer, a close advisor to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, after consultations with Israel’s Ministry of Defense and the military. Among Israel’s key demands is the right for its army to carry out 'active enforcement' to ensure that Hezbollah cannot rearm or rebuild its military infrastructure near the southern Lebanese border. Another demand is that Israel's air force retains freedom of operation in Lebanese airspace. These demands, however, conflict with U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which stipulates that the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) should enforce the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. An Israeli official noted, 'We are talking about 1701 with increased enforcement. Our message is that if the Lebanese army and UNIFIL do more, the Israeli army will do less, and vice versa.' A U.S. official commented that it is unlikely Lebanon or the international community would accept these terms, as they would severely undermine Lebanon's sovereignty. Upon arriving in Beirut on Monday, Hochstein met with acting Prime Minister Najib Mikati, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, and other Lebanese leaders to discuss Israel's conditions. Berri had earlier told Al-Arabiya that Hochstein’s visit represented 'the last chance before the U.S. elections to reach a solution' to the conflict in Lebanon. He emphasized Lebanon's consensus on adhering to U.N. Resolution 1701 and rejected any amendments, which is what Israel is reportedly demanding. Hochstein is advocating for the Lebanese army to deploy a significant force—at least 8,000 troops—across southern Lebanon as part of a comprehensive diplomatic solution to the war. In recent years, the Lebanese army's presence in this region has been limited. Additionally, Hochstein aims to strengthen UNIFIL's mandate, enabling it to assist the Lebanese army in preventing armed groups not controlled by the Lebanese government from operating near the Israeli border. U.S. officials pointed out that, since the 2006 war, UNIFIL has struggled to enforce Resolution 1701 effectively, allowing Hezbollah to build extensive military infrastructure in southern Lebanon in violation of the resolution.The post Israel Submits War-Ending Demands to U.S. first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-submits-war-ending-demands-us/	2024-10-22T02:45:18-07:00

On Monday, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri presented ideas to U.S. mediator Amos Hochstein to address the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, according to a media report. Sky News Arabia, citing unnamed sources, reported that Berri suggested to Hochstein that the three-week truce agreement could be reinstated and that Lebanon could elect a president during the first week of the ceasefire. Berri also stated that the newly elected president would oversee the enforcement of Resolution 1701 and work towards securing a lasting ceasefire. The sources noted that the U.S. had reconsidered its position on amending Resolution 1701 following Hochstein's visit and that Hochstein did not bring a specific 'solution' for Lebanon. The sources further explained that any changes to Resolution 1701 would require approval from Russia and China, and Washington is not currently inclined to pursue that effort.The post Berri to Hochstein: President Could Be Elected in First Week of Truce first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/berri-hochstein-president-elected-first-week-truce/	2024-10-22T02:44:24-07:00

Sources familiar with the meeting revealed to MTV that the 21-day ceasefire is seen as the starting point for establishing a long-term truce before fully implementing Resolution 1701. The sources further mentioned that Berri agreed to Hochstein's proposal and engaged in discussions about the specific details and phases of the implementation process. Hochstein suggested an approach to Berri that would involve executing Resolution 1701 with an additional annex, outlining a mechanism for its implementation, the sources noted.The post Berri Backs Hochstein Proposal, Talks Ceasefire Mechanism first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/berri-backs-hochstein-talks-ceasefire-mechanism/	2024-10-22T02:39:21-07:00	
Israel Claims Hezbollah Hides Cash and Gold Beneath Sahel Hospita...	The director of a hospital in Lebanon has refuted claims made by the Israeli military that Hezbollah is storing money and gold beneath the medical facility. Fadi Alameh, a member of parliament and the director of Sahel General Hospital, dismissed the accusation, stating that there are no tunnels under the hospital. He also confirmed that the hospital, located in a southern suburb of Beirut, is currently being evacuated. Alameh, who represents the area where the hospital is located, called on the Lebanese Army and other relevant authorities to inspect the hospital and verify the claims. In an interview with Al-Jadeed TV, he clarified that the hospital is a private medical institution with underground surgery rooms, and has been operating for 42 years without any political affiliations. The Israeli military had accused Hezbollah of storing hundreds of millions of dollars in cash and gold beneath the hospital. According to Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari, there is an estimated half a billion dollars in cash and gold hidden in the hospital's bunker. Hagari suggested that this money could be used to rebuild Lebanon. Additionally, Israeli army Arabic-language spokesperson Avichay Adraee urged the Lebanese government to recover this 'stolen' money and prevent Hezbollah from utilizing it. Hagari further claimed that Iran funds Hezbollah by sending money and gold through its embassy in Beirut, though no concrete evidence was provided to support this assertion. Hagari also revealed that Israeli airstrikes had recently targeted key Hezbollah figures involved in the transfer of money between Iran and Hezbollah, including attacks in Beirut in early October and a strike in Syria on Monday. On Monday, Israeli military chief Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi stated that more than two dozen targets linked to al-Qard al-Hassan, a financial institution associated with Hezbollah, were struck. According to Halevi, nearly 30 Hezbollah-related sites in Lebanon were hit as part of the operation, targeting the group’s financial operations which Israel claims fund 'Hezbollah's terrorist activities.'The post Israel Claims Hezbollah Hides Cash and Gold Beneath Sahel Hospital first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-hezbollah-hides-cash-gold-sahel-hospital/	2024-10-22T02:38:51-07:00	
Israel Arrests 7 Citizens for Allegedly Running 'Spy Network' for...	Israeli authorities have dismantled a 'spy network' composed of seven Israeli citizens accused of working for Iran, according to a joint statement released by Israel Police and the Israel Security Agency (ISA) on Monday. The individuals, all Jewish citizens from Haifa and other areas in northern Israel, were reportedly involved in 'gathering sensitive information on IDF bases and energy infrastructure.' The statement noted that the alleged espionage activities took place over more than two years, during which the suspects conducted 'extensive reconnaissance missions on IDF bases across the country.' These missions were financially rewarded, often through cryptocurrency payments. The authorities emphasized that the arrests highlight Iran’s continued efforts to 'recruit and exploit Israeli citizens for espionage and terrorism within Israel.' They also mentioned that an indictment against the suspects would be filed in the coming days. These arrests come at a time when Israel is preparing for a retaliatory strike against Iran in response to Tehran’s missile attack on October 1, an incident for which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed Iran 'will pay.'The post Israel Arrests 7 Citizens for Allegedly Running 'Spy Network' for Iran first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-arrests-7-citizens-spy-network-iran/	2024-10-21T08:18:38-07:00

Israeli Strikes Hit Hezbollah’s Al-Qard Al-Hassan in Dahieh, Beka...	Israeli airstrikes targeted Beirut’s southern suburbs on Sunday night after the Israeli military announced it would strike Hezbollah’s financial institution, al-Qard al-Hassan, in various areas including Haret Hreik, Shiyyah, Ghobeiri, Choueifat, Tahwitat al-Ghadir, and Burj al-Barajneh. According to the National News Agency (NNA), 11 strikes were reported in Beirut’s southern suburbs, many aimed at al-Qard al-Hassan. Additional strikes hit locations in Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley and in the south. NNA also reported that one of the strikes landed near Beirut's main airport, a critical hub for humanitarian aid and evacuations amidst the ongoing conflict. Footage from AFP showed large plumes of smoke rising near the targeted facility. David Asher, an expert on illicit finance and senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, remarked that the targeting of al-Qard al-Hassan was significant, describing the organization as 'cash-based,' and implying that the strikes would render their cash reserves worthless. He added that the institution held large accounts with major Lebanese banks. Al-Qard al-Hassan issued a statement calling the targeting a sign of Israel’s 'bankruptcy,' assuring its customers that it had taken measures to protect their funds. Residents in the vicinity of the organization’s branches in Beirut were seen evacuating the area. Confusion and panic ensued when an evacuation notice issued for the Choueifat area incorrectly labeled a target as Grand Cinema ABC Verdun, a theater in a shopping mall located over 10 kilometers away in central Beirut. Al-Qard al-Hassan, a nonprofit organization sanctioned by both the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, provides financial services and is widely used by ordinary Lebanese. Israel’s airstrikes came a day after U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin expressed concern over the high civilian casualties in Lebanon and urged Israel to scale back its strikes, particularly in and around Beirut. Earlier on Sunday, Israel reported hitting dozens of targets in Lebanon as Hezbollah claimed responsibility for rocket attacks and ground clashes with Israeli forces.The post Israeli Strikes Hit Hezbollah’s Al-Qard Al-Hassan in Dahieh, Bekaa, and South first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-hit-hezbollahs-al-qard-al-hassan/	2024-10-21T03:17:33-07:00	
Berri Unveils Plan to Save Lebanon, Says US Pushing for Ceasefire	With U.S. mediator Amos Hochstein set to arrive in Beirut on Monday amid rising tensions in Lebanon, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri emphasized that this visit represents 'the last chance before the U.S. elections to find a solution' for the country. In an interview with Al-Arabiya, Berri revealed that he has been authorized by Hezbollah to negotiate on its behalf since 2006 and confirmed that the group agrees with U.N. Resolution 1701. He further noted that there is rare consensus among the Lebanese on this resolution, adding, 'We are committed to it.' Berri also made it clear that he opposes any amendments to Resolution 1701, and shared that he is working on a plan to save Lebanon. He dismissed claims that Iran is obstructing this effort, stressing that there is a U.S. desire to halt the conflict in Lebanon before the upcoming U.S. presidential election. Regarding the nomination of the army commander, Berri highlighted that a constitutional amendment and the approval of more than 86 deputies would be required. He acknowledged the unprecedented challenges facing Prime Minister Najib Mikati's government. Berri also pointed to the positive impact of the Saudi-Iranian rapprochement, contrasting it with Israel's destructive actions in Lebanon, similar to those in Gaza. He added that he has not discussed electing a Lebanese president until after a ceasefire is achieved.The post Berri Unveils Plan to Save Lebanon, Says US Pushing for Ceasefire first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/berri-plan-save-lebanon-us-ceasefire/	2024-10-21T03:16:36-07:00

Watch: Extinct Tasmanian Tiger May Return, Thanks to Preserved He...	The Tasmanian tiger, a marsupial apex predator, went extinct almost a century ago, but scientists are now closer than ever to bringing it back through genome sequencing—much like the fictional revival of dinosaurs in *Jurassic Park*. The Tasmanian tiger's genome has been reconstructed with 99.9% accuracy, marking a significant breakthrough in the ongoing 'de-extinction' project. Currently, only 45 gaps remain in the sequencing process, made possible by the serendipitous discovery of a preserved Tasmanian tiger head in Australia that dates back over 110 years. The ambitious effort is being led by Colossal Biosciences, a Texas-based company also working to revive the woolly mammoth and the extinct dodo bird. What Happened to the Tasmanian Tiger? Also known as the thylacine, the Tasmanian tiger was once the apex predator in the forests of Tasmania, Australia. Sadly, the species was declared extinct in 1936, following the death of the last known individual at Tasmania's Beaumaris Zoo. Colossal Biosciences recently teased that they are close to making a major announcement about the animal’s revival. The thylacine, officially named *Thylacinus cynocephalus*, may soon walk the Earth once again. A Head Pickled in a Jar May Bring the Tasmanian Tiger Back The preserved Tasmanian tiger head, discovered in a jar, still contained RNA molecules—crucial for reconstructing the animal’s genome. By analyzing samples from the head, researchers were able to sequence the majority of its DNA, including some RNA strands. This surprising discovery is being hailed as nothing short of a scientific miracle. Professor Andrew Pask, who leads the Thylacine Integrated Genetic Restoration Research (TIGRR) lab at the University of Melbourne, was stunned by the find. 'It was literally a head in a bucket of ethanol in the back of a cupboard that had been there for about 110 years,' he told *The Guardian*. 'It was pretty gruesome, with large chunks of it missing.' Genome Sequencing: A Path to Reviving Extinct Species? Professor Pask explained to *LiveScience* that old samples can yield excellent genomic data, which is the foundation for the 'de-extinction' of lost species. Genomes are the complete set of DNA that provide organisms with their unique traits and contain the information necessary for growth, development, and functioning. As Pask emphasized, obtaining a high-quality genome sequence is key to the efforts to bring back the Tasmanian tiger. 'The genome is the full blueprint for de-extincting this species,' he said, signaling an exciting future for the revival of extinct animals.The post Watch: Extinct Tasmanian Tiger May Return, Thanks to Preserved Head in Ethanol first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/extinct-tasmanian-tiger-return-head-ethanol/	2024-10-20T02:51:46-07:00

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday accused Iran and its ally, Hezbollah, of attempting to assassinate both him and his wife, warning that those responsible would face severe consequences. This statement came after Netanyahu’s office reported that a drone had targeted his residence in Caesarea. Netanyahu, who was not at home during the attack, stated, 'Iran's proxies who attempted to kill me and my wife today have made a serious mistake,' emphasizing that they would 'pay a heavy price' for their actions.The post Netanyahu: Iran and Proxies Will Pay ‘Heavy Price’ for Assassination Attempt first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/iran-proxies-pay-price-assassination-attempt/	2024-10-20T02:13:55-07:00	
Israeli Strikes Hit Dahieh at Dawn Following Evacuation Warning	Two Israeli airstrikes hit the southern suburbs of Beirut on Sunday, following warnings from the Israeli military for civilians to evacuate two specific areas, according to Lebanese state media. These strikes came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Hezbollah, a group backed by Iran, of attempting to assassinate him with an explosive drone targeting his residence. According to the National News Agency, one of the strikes hit a residential building in Haret Hreik, near a mosque and hospital. The Israeli military had previously warned civilians to evacuate areas near Hezbollah-affiliated buildings, with the military's Arabic spokesman, Avichay Adraee, stating on Telegram that the Israeli Defense Forces would soon target these locations. On Saturday, Netanyahu's office reported that a drone had been launched at his residence in Caesarea, though neither he nor his wife were home, and no injuries were sustained. Netanyahu condemned the attack, calling it a 'grave mistake' by Hezbollah and promising severe retaliation against anyone threatening Israeli citizens. In response to questions about its involvement in the attack, Iran’s United Nations mission confirmed that Hezbollah was responsible, but Hezbollah has not claimed responsibility for the incident. Tensions between Israel and Iran, Hezbollah's main backer, have been escalating since early October, when Israel vowed to retaliate against Iran for a missile barrage, and Iran has warned of retaliation if attacked.The post Israeli Strikes Hit Dahieh at Dawn Following Evacuation Warning first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strikes-dahieh-evacuation-warning/	2024-10-20T02:13:23-07:00	
Hezbollah Launches Rocket Salvo at Northern Israel	Hezbollah announced that it had fired rockets at northern Israel, including a military base near Haifa, following a barrage of projectiles launched from Lebanon, as confirmed by the Israeli army. Hezbollah claimed a 'large salvo' of advanced rockets targeted a military base east of Haifa, as part of its vow to escalate attacks on Israel weeks into the ongoing war that began on September 23. The Iran-backed militant group also reported launching rockets at the northern town of Safed after the Israeli army confirmed that 115 projectiles were fired from Lebanon toward Israel on Saturday. Sirens echoed across northern Israel as the projectiles hit the region, warning residents of incoming attacks. Israeli emergency services reported that a man was killed by shrapnel near Acre, while five others sustained injuries in Kiryat Ata, mostly due to shrapnel, according to Magen David Adom, an Israeli emergency service provider. On Saturday evening, Hezbollah stated that it had struck Kiryat Ata in retaliation for Israeli strikes on civilians, particularly the recent bombing of Nabatiyeh in southern Lebanon, where 25 people were killed. The attack was also dedicated to Hezbollah's late leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in a significant Israeli strike on southern Beirut on September 27. A rocket hit Kiryat Ata, damaging a three-story building and destroying nearby vehicles. Firefighters and ambulances were deployed to the area, as shown in AFP footage. Meanwhile, Israel confirmed that a drone had targeted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea. However, Netanyahu and his wife were not present during the attack, and no injuries were reported. On Friday, Hezbollah announced it was entering a new 'escalatory phase' in its conflict with Israel. This comes after Israel significantly ramped up its airstrikes on Lebanon and deployed ground forces following nearly a year of cross-border skirmishes. Lebanese health officials reported that two people were killed in an Israeli strike on a key highway north of Beirut, marking the first attack on that area since the conflict with Hezbollah reignited. According to an AFP tally, at least 1,418 people have died in Lebanon since late September, although the true death toll is likely higher.The post Hezbollah Launches Rocket Salvo at Northern Israel first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-launches-rocket-salvo-northern-israel/	2024-10-20T02:13:06-07:00

Iran's United Nations mission has confirmed that Hezbollah, a group backed and funded by Tehran, was responsible for the drone attack targeting the residence of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. According to Iran's official IRNA news agency, the mission stated, 'This action was taken by the Lebanese Hezbollah' when asked about Iran's involvement in the incident. Earlier on Saturday, Netanyahu accused Hezbollah of attempting to assassinate him after a drone originating from Lebanon struck his family home. Netanyahu warned that both Iran and its proxies would face severe consequences for attempting to harm Israeli citizens. While Israeli officials initially pointed to Iran as being behind the attack, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Esmaeil Baghaei, dismissed these claims as lies, calling it part of Israel's 'permanent practice' of spreading falsehoods. The attack comes amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, in which Hezbollah and other Iran-aligned groups have become involved. Tehran itself has directly targeted Israel twice during the conflict, most notably with a 200-missile barrage on October 1. Israel has vowed to retaliate for these attacks, and Iran has warned it will respond if Israel strikes back.The post Iran Claims Hezbollah Launched Drone Attack on Netanyahu’s Residence first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/iran-hezbollah-drone-attack-netanyahus-residence/	2024-10-20T02:12:54-07:00	
Fearing Israeli Strikes on Airport, Lebanese Flee by Sea	Hassan Alik, escaping the intensifying violence of the Israel-Hezbollah conflict, departed Lebanon on Saturday aboard a ship, avoiding Beirut’s airport, which he feared 'could be bombed at any time.' The 31-year-old headed to the northern port of Tripoli on Lebanon's Mediterranean coast. So far, this area has been spared from Israeli attacks during a month of heavy fighting across much of the country. Although Lebanon's international airport remains undamaged, the Israeli military warned last month that it could strike the airport to disrupt weapons transfers to Hezbollah, backed by Iran. Fearing an attack, many Lebanese seeking to leave have chosen a 13-hour sea journey to Turkey on cargo ships modified for passengers, rather than flying from Beirut’s airport. The airport had been targeted during Israel's last major war with Hezbollah in 2006. 'I'm leaving from here because I'm scared to use the airport,' said Alik from the port in Tripoli. 'If I buy a plane ticket, the airport could get bombed,' added the resident of Beirut’s southern suburbs, a Hezbollah stronghold that has been hit hard during recent bombings. Israel launched its intense air campaign on Lebanon on September 23, following almost a year of cross-border exchanges with Hezbollah, in connection with the Gaza war. Israeli ground forces later joined the assault. The ongoing conflict has claimed at least 1,454 lives in Lebanon, according to an AFP tally based on Lebanese health ministry reports, though the actual number is likely higher. Most airlines, except for national carrier Middle East Airlines, have stopped flying to Beirut due to the hostilities. The large ships departing from Tripoli, once used exclusively for cargo to southern Turkey, began taking passengers about a year ago, offering tickets for around $350, according to Captain Salem Jleilati. Since the conflict escalated in September, demand for these trips has surged from 150 passengers a week to at least 900. Muammar Malas, 52, from northern Lebanon, said he chose to travel by sea because it was difficult to reach Beirut’s airport, which is located near Hezbollah’s stronghold in the southern suburbs. 'The cargo ships aren’t built for passengers, but we have no other choice,' Malas explained. More than a million people have fled the violence across Lebanon, officials reported. Mohammad Hawar, 22, has already been displaced twice, first from the southern city of Nabatieh, where Israeli strikes killed dozens of people, and later from southern Beirut. 'The best thing to do now is leave Lebanon,' he told AFP as he boarded the ship. Israa Sweidan, a Palestinian woman from the Beddawi refugee camp, which has also been targeted, said the sea route from Tripoli was 'currently the safest option in Lebanon.'The post Fearing Israeli Strikes on Airport, Lebanese Flee by Sea first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/fearing-israeli-strikes-airport-lebanese-flee-sea/	2024-10-20T02:12:24-07:00	
Gantz Urges Netanyahu to Halt Videos, Warns of Prolonged War in L...	In response to criticism from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party, which accused him of failing to condemn a Hezbollah drone attack on the prime minister's residence in Caesarea due to 'petty politics,' Benny Gantz's National Unity party issued a firm rebuttal. The party urged Netanyahu to 'stop focusing on press releases and embarrassing videos.' 'At a time when hundreds of rockets are being fired at Israeli citizens, lives are being lost, and soldiers are falling, the Prime Minister is concerned with himself and property taxes,' the statement read. According to the Kan public broadcaster, property tax officials and a gardener had visited Netanyahu’s home following the attack. Gantz’s party warned that Netanyahu must ensure Israel is not 'dragged into a prolonged war of attrition' in Lebanon. They also emphasized the need for Israel to intensify its strikes in Lebanon, including targeting state infrastructure, and called for a swift and 'effective response' against Iran.The post Gantz Urges Netanyahu to Halt Videos, Warns of Prolonged War in Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/gantz-urges-netanyahu-halt-videos-prolonged-war-lebanon/	2024-10-20T02:12:06-07:00	
Mikati Condemns Iranian ‘Interference,’ Orders Envoy Summoned	On Friday, Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati criticized comments reportedly made by Iranian parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf regarding Tehran’s willingness to negotiate with France on the implementation of U.N. Resolution 1701. Mikati stated that such remarks represent 'blatant interference' in Lebanon's internal affairs and an attempt to exert unwelcome control over the country. He emphasized that during recent visits by Iran's foreign minister and parliament speaker, Lebanese officials had made it clear that Iran must respect Lebanon’s sovereignty. 'Lebanon is currently facing an unprecedented assault, and we are working with our allies, including France, to pressure Israel to agree to a ceasefire,' Mikati said. He stressed that it is the responsibility of the Lebanese state to manage negotiations concerning Resolution 1701 and urged all parties to support Lebanon's efforts rather than impose new forms of control that undermine its sovereignty. Mikati also directed caretaker Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib to summon the Iranian charge d'affaires for questioning regarding Ghalibaf’s alleged remarks. Later, the Iranian parliament denied the comments attributed to Ghalibaf, affirming that Tehran supports whatever decisions are made by the Lebanese people, government, and resistance to secure a lasting truce. Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea praised Mikati's response, noting that it gives hope that the Lebanese state is beginning to 'take responsibility.' Geagea added that Mikati’s remarks reflect the views of all patriotic Lebanese and encouraged the prime minister to continue demanding a ceasefire based on U.N. resolutions 1559, 1680, and 1701, as this is the only way to end the ongoing violence that has plagued Lebanon for nearly two months.The post Mikati Condemns Iranian ‘Interference,’ Orders Envoy Summoned first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/mikati-condemns-iranian-interference-envoy-summoned/	2024-10-18T23:43:18-07:00	
Hezbollah Strikes Israel, Unveils New ‘Escalatory Phase’	On Friday, Hezbollah launched a series of rocket attacks targeting Israel's Yoav barracks in the occupied Golan Heights and the Zofolon area, located north of Haifa. In response, the Israeli army ordered the evacuation of 20 towns in southern Lebanon and conducted strikes on several southern Lebanese towns, including Jbaa, Aita al-Shaab, Zrariyeh, Marwanieh, Bazourieh, Shaaytiyeh, Ebl al-Siqi, Malkieh, and Ansar. The previous day, the Israeli military reported the deaths of five soldiers during combat operations in southern Lebanon, bringing the total number of Israeli troops killed since the start of their raids last month to 19. Additionally, Israeli sources confirmed that 31 soldiers were injured in a drone attack near the border. On Friday, the Israeli army announced plans to deploy another brigade to its northern border as part of an ongoing assessment of the situation. In recent days, Hezbollah has successfully targeted several Israeli tanks near the border with guided missiles, as Israeli forces attempted to penetrate Lebanon's border villages. On Thursday, Hezbollah reported hitting two Merkava tanks near the village of Labbouneh, resulting in fires and casualties. Hezbollah lawmaker Hassan Fadlallah stated that the Israeli army has yet to establish full control over any village in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah also declared the launch of a new phase in its conflict with Israel, revealing that it had used precision-guided missiles against Israeli forces for the first time. In a statement on Thursday, the group announced an escalation in the confrontation, signaling that more significant developments were expected in the coming days.The post Hezbollah Strikes Israel, Unveils New ‘Escalatory Phase’ first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-strikes-israel-new-escalatory-phase/	2024-10-18T23:43:11-07:00

Samir Geagea, leader of the Lebanese Forces, criticized the Lebanese government for acting more like a 'rescue committee' than a functioning state, accusing it of allowing Iran to use Lebanon as a battleground for its own conflicts. In an interview with *Asharq al-Awsat* published on Friday, Geagea blamed Hezbollah for Lebanon's current situation, accusing the country's leaders of idly standing by instead of enforcing United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701. Geagea urged the government to take action by convening and making a firm decision to deploy the army and enforce the resolution. He also commented on the aftermath of the killing of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli strike, claiming that Hezbollah is now fully controlled by Iran. According to Geagea, all decisions within Hezbollah are now being made by Iran, which he believes will continue its fight through Hezbollah 'until the last fighter.'The post Geagea Claims Hezbollah Now Fully Controlled by Iran After Nasrallah’s Death first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/geagea-hezbollah-controlled-iran-nasrallahs/	2024-10-18T23:43:03-07:00	
Bassil Urges Unity, Ceasefire, and Presidential Consensus	Jebran Bassil, the head of the Free Patriotic Movement, has urged for unity in facing Israel, calling for an immediate ceasefire and the election of a consensus president in Lebanon. In an interview with the al-Modon news portal, Bassil emphasized that the top priority should be achieving a ceasefire and preventing any potential re-occupation of southern Lebanon. Bassil revealed that he has introduced a new initiative, which he has discussed with key international players such as the U.S., Saudi Arabia, France, Egypt, and Qatar. He mentioned that he also held meetings with the British ambassador and the Special Representative of the U.N. Secretary-General. His plan starts with securing a ceasefire and is followed by the election of a president that all parties can agree on. Bassil added that he is currently gathering the names of potential presidential candidates, including Hezbollah's Suleiman Franjieh, the army chief, and Samir Geagea, leader of the Lebanese Forces. Bassil further stressed the importance of enforcing U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, and he affirmed that no Lebanese citizen would tolerate any form of occupation. He also praised Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, describing him as a patriotic, responsible, and wise leader, despite their longstanding political differences.The post Bassil Urges Unity, Ceasefire, and Presidential Consensus first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/bassil-unity-ceasefire-presidential-consensus/	2024-10-18T23:42:50-07:00	
Hamas Declares No Hostage Release Until Gaza War Ends	On Friday, top Hamas political leader Khalil al-Hayya confirmed the death of the group's leader, Yahya Sinwar. In a televised address, al-Hayya reaffirmed Hamas' position, stating that Israeli hostages taken during the group's attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, would not be released until a cease-fire is achieved in Gaza's yearlong war. He emphasized, 'Those prisoners will not be returned to you before the aggression on Gaza ends and there is a withdrawal.' Al-Hayya also noted that Sinwar's death would serve to 'build strength' within the group.The post Hamas Declares No Hostage Release Until Gaza War Ends first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hamas-no-hostage-release-until-gaza-war-ends/	2024-10-18T23:42:42-07:00

Biden: Ceasefire in Lebanon May Be Easier to Achieve Than in Gaza	U.S. President Joe Biden recently suggested that negotiating a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah could prove easier than doing so with Hamas. During a meeting in Berlin with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Biden discussed the potential path to end the ongoing Middle East conflict, particularly following the recent killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza. Biden expressed optimism, saying the leaders see a possible opportunity for a cease-fire in Lebanon, though he noted that achieving a cease-fire in Gaza would be more challenging. He emphasized that there needs to be a plan in place for what happens after a cease-fire is reached. Yahya Sinwar, a prominent Hamas leader, was killed by Israeli forces on Wednesday. Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the following day but did not disclose whether Netanyahu had committed to resuming negotiations for a cease-fire or the release of hostages. Biden stated that discussions on these matters are ongoing but did not provide further details. When asked about Israel’s potential response to Iran’s recent missile attack, Biden confirmed he had an understanding of when and how Israel might retaliate but declined to elaborate further.The post Biden: Ceasefire in Lebanon May Be Easier to Achieve Than in Gaza first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/ceasefire-lebanon-easier-achieve-gaza/	2024-10-18T23:41:57-07:00	
WHO: 'Very High' Cholera Risk Spreading in Lebanon	The World Health Organization (WHO) issued a warning on Wednesday about the 'very high' risk of cholera spreading in Lebanon after a case of the disease was confirmed in the country's northern region. Abdinasir Abubakar, the WHO's representative in Lebanon, expressed concern over the potential outbreak, citing the worsening water and sanitation conditions for refugees and in vulnerable areas. He emphasized that if cholera were to reach the newly displaced population, it could spread rapidly. Lebanon experienced its first cholera outbreak in three decades between 2022 and 2023, primarily in the northern region. With over a million people displaced due to the Israel-Hezbollah conflict, Abubakar pointed to particular concerns for southern Lebanon and Beirut, where communities have not built up immunity to cholera in decades. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stated that Lebanon’s Ministry of Public Health had activated emergency measures, such as enhanced surveillance and contact tracing, after detecting the cholera case. In August, the ministry initiated a cholera vaccination campaign aimed at 350,000 people in high-risk areas, but the effort was disrupted by the ongoing violence, according to the WHO. Cholera, a disease that spreads primarily through contaminated water and food, leads to severe diarrhea and dehydration. Those living in areas with limited access to clean water or poor sanitation are especially vulnerable, as the disease can result from consuming food or water contaminated with the cholera bacteria.The post WHO: 'Very High' Cholera Risk Spreading in Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/who-high-cholera-risk-spreading-lebanon/	2024-10-17T01:02:07-07:00	
US B-2 Strikes Hit 5 Houthi Weapon Storage Sites, Defense Secreta...	The U.S. carried out airstrikes on five 'hardened underground weapons storage locations' in areas controlled by the Houthis in Yemen, using B-2 stealth bombers, according to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Wednesday evening (Thursday morning local time). Austin described the operation as a 'unique demonstration' of the U.S.'s ability to strike facilities that adversaries attempt to protect, regardless of how deeply they are buried or fortified. He emphasized that the use of B-2 Spirit long-range stealth bombers highlights America's global strike capabilities to target such locations whenever necessary. The defense secretary explained that the strikes were authorized by President Joe Biden with the aim of 'further degrading' the Houthis' ability to attack, following over a year of their assaults on U.S. and international vessels in the region. The targeted facilities housed 'various weapons components' used in these attacks. Austin added, 'We will continue to make it clear to the Houthis that there will be consequences for their illegal and reckless attacks.'The post US B-2 Strikes Hit 5 Houthi Weapon Storage Sites, Defense Secretary Confirms first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/b-2-strikes-5-houthi-weapon-storage-sites-secretary-confirms/	2024-10-17T00:33:38-07:00	
Breaking: Houthi Spokesperson Warns: US Will 'Pay the Price' for ...	Yemen's Houthi movement has declared that the United States will 'pay the price' following U.S. airstrikes against the Iran-backed group. These strikes targeted five underground weapons storage facilities, with the use of B-2 stealth bombers. Nasruddin Amer, deputy head of the Houthis' media office, made a statement on X, saying that the U.S. aggression in Yemen would not deter them from their stance in support of Gaza. The Houthis have been targeting ships in the Red Sea for months, a critical global shipping route, claiming their actions are in response to Israel's war in Gaza. Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis form part of an Iran-led alliance that spans across Yemen, Syria, Gaza, and Iraq. This coalition has been attacking Israel and its allies since the onset of the conflict and has vowed to continue until a ceasefire is achieved in Gaza. The U.S. strikes on Yemen occur amidst rising tensions across the region. Israel is anticipated to retaliate against Iran for a recent missile attack, all while dealing with intensifying conflicts with Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza.The post Breaking: Houthi Spokesperson Warns: US Will 'Pay the Price' for Yemen Strikes first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/houthi-warns-us-pay-price-strikes/	2024-10-17T00:32:59-07:00	
Gallant: Truce Talks in Lebanon Must Happen ‘Under Fire’	Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant emphasized on Wednesday that any negotiations aimed at ending the conflict in Lebanon must take place 'under fire.' He made this statement during an assessment of the situation on the northern front. During his meeting with commanders of the reservist 146th Division, Gallant pointed out that the recent capture of Hezbollah operatives in southern Lebanon highlighted both the Israeli army's effectiveness and the challenges faced by Hezbollah, according to a statement from the Defense Ministry. 'We are gaining valuable insights through interrogation, information that we would not have otherwise obtained, and it will serve us well in the near future,' Gallant said. He also added that the ongoing ground operations will enable displaced residents of northern Israel to return to their homes.The post Gallant: Truce Talks in Lebanon Must Happen ‘Under Fire’ first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/truce-talks-lebanon-must-happen-under-fire/	2024-10-17T00:32:18-07:00	
Macron Riles Netanyahu with Sharp Comment on Israel’s Founding	French President Emmanuel Macron has added further strain to the already tense relations with Israel through a recent comment regarding the founding of the Israeli state. This remark, quickly criticized by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was seen as a distortion of historical facts. Macron, aiming to take a firmer stance on Middle East conflicts following Israel’s offensive in Lebanon, a former French protectorate, stated that halting the export of weapons used by Israel in Lebanon and Gaza was the only way to end the ongoing conflicts. France, which has the largest Jewish population in Europe, has repeatedly called for a ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon, while also increasingly condemning Israel for the civilian casualties in these areas. Paris has also expressed outrage over Israeli attacks on the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which includes 700 French troops. In another sign of escalating tensions, organizers of the upcoming Euronaval defense show in Paris announced that, following a French government decision, Israeli exhibits and stands would be excluded from the event. Macron’s Controversial Remarks During a closed-door meeting at the Elysee Palace, Macron stated, 'Mr. Netanyahu must not forget that his country was created by a decision of the U.N.,' referencing the 1947 U.N. General Assembly resolution to partition Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state. He added that this is not the time to disregard U.N. decisions. These comments were shared by two meeting participants who spoke anonymously to AFP. Netanyahu responded to Macron’s statement, asserting that Israel’s establishment was a result of victory in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, not a U.N. resolution. He also highlighted the contribution of Holocaust survivors, including French Jews, who fought for Israel’s independence after surviving Nazi occupation and persecution during World War II. 'A reminder to the president of France: It was not the U.N. resolution that established the State of Israel, but rather the victory achieved in the war of independence with the blood of heroic fighters, many of whom were Holocaust survivors — including from the Vichy regime in France,' Netanyahu said. Tense Phone Call The tense nature of the exchange between the two leaders was evident in a late-night summary of their phone call released by the French presidency. Macron condemned 'indiscriminate Israeli strikes that only add to an already intolerable human toll, in Gaza as in Lebanon,' further highlighting the strained relations. Concerns Within the Jewish Community Macron’s remarks also sparked unease within France's Jewish community. Yonathan Arfi, president of the Representative Council of French Jewish Institutions (CRIF), warned that Macron’s comments 'dangerously strengthen the camp of those who question Israel’s right to exist.' Caroline Yadan, an MP from Macron’s party, expressed concern, asking, 'What does this statement imply? That what the U.N. has done, the U.N. can undo? Is this a warning?' The French left-leaning newspaper *Liberation* remarked that Macron’s comments have caused uncertainty and division among his supporters, noting that the president’s words have 'sown trouble in the macronie.'The post Macron Riles Netanyahu with Sharp Comment on Israel’s Founding first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/macron-riles-netanyahu-comment-israels-founding/	2024-10-17T00:30:52-07:00	
Watch: Tuchel Set to Be Unveiled as New England Manager	Former Chelsea head coach Thomas Tuchel is set to take over as the manager of the England men's national team, becoming the third foreign manager in the role after Sven-Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello. The German coach, who led Chelsea to Champions League glory in 2021 and enjoyed successful stints with PSG, Bayern Munich, and Borussia Dortmund, is expected to officially take charge in January 2025. According to Sky Germany, Tuchel is poised to sign an 18-month contract, which will run until the end of the 2026 World Cup. The deal was reached after several discussions with the Football Association (FA), with an announcement anticipated on Wednesday, October 16. With Tuchel's impressive track record, the FA hopes he can help end England’s 58-year wait for a major tournament victory. The FA decided against appointing an English manager to succeed Gareth Southgate, who consistently guided England to the knockout stages of major tournaments but fell short of winning a title. Southgate stepped down after the Euro 2024 final loss, and Lee Carsley has been serving as interim manager since August. Tuchel previously managed Chelsea from January 2021, leading the club to Champions League success shortly after his arrival, as well as winning the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup. Despite a successful tenure, he was sacked in September 2022. Following his departure from Chelsea, Tuchel was appointed head coach of Bayern Munich, where he won an 11th consecutive Bundesliga title. However, his time at Bayern also saw the club endure its first trophyless season in 12 years. As Tuchel prepares to take over from Southgate, he will inherit a talented squad featuring the likes of Harry Kane, Jude Bellingham, and Cole Palmer, positioning England as strong contenders for the 2026 World Cup. Commenting on the potential appointment, England captain Harry Kane told Sky Germany, 'I know Thomas well from last year. He’s a fantastic coach and person, so I’m sure the FA will contact me when they have more information.' Southgate's tenure saw England reach consecutive Euro finals, as well as a World Cup semi-final and quarter-final, but the nation still awaits its first major tournament win since the 1966 World Cup.The post Watch: Tuchel Set to Be Unveiled as New England Manager first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/tuchel-unveiled-new-england-manager/	2024-10-16T01:16:53-07:00

Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati announced on Tuesday that Lebanon is prepared to strengthen its military presence in the southern region after a ceasefire is established, noting that Israeli forces have been making brief incursions across the border. In an interview with AFP, Mikati said, 'We currently have 4,500 soldiers stationed in southern Lebanon, and we are looking to increase that number to between 7,000 and 11,000.' He added that once a ceasefire is in place, Lebanon will be able to redeploy soldiers from other parts of the country to the south. He also mentioned reports of 'brief Israeli incursions' into southern Lebanon. Mikati further revealed that security measures have been intensified at Beirut's only airport to eliminate any possible justification for an Israeli attack. 'The government is doing everything within its power to prevent any pretexts from being used by Israel,' he said, adding that 'enhanced security has been implemented at the airport,' which is near Hezbollah's stronghold in southern Beirut, an area heavily targeted by Israeli airstrikes.The post Breaking: Mikati Pledges to Strengthen Army in South After Ceasefire first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/mikati-strengthen-army-south-ceasefire/	2024-10-16T00:54:37-07:00	
Hezbollah Strikes Haifa, Threatens Attacks Across All of Israel	Hezbollah issued a strong warning on Tuesday, threatening to strike targets across Israel while vowing that it would not be defeated despite the ongoing heavy bombardment of its strongholds and leadership by Israeli forces. In the latest developments of the conflict, Hezbollah claimed responsibility for launching rockets towards the northern Israeli city of Haifa. In response, Israel carried out airstrikes in several areas of Lebanon. Hezbollah’s deputy chief, Naim Qassem, delivered a defiant speech, asserting that the group 'will not be defeated' in its battle against Israel. 'Since the Israeli enemy has targeted all of Lebanon, we have the right, from a defensive stance, to hit any location in Israel, be it in the center, north, or south,' Qassem declared. He also called for a ceasefire, stating, 'The solution is a ceasefire.' Iran, a key supporter of Hezbollah, has been involved in diplomatic efforts to broker a ceasefire in both Lebanon and Gaza, as concerns about a wider regional conflict escalate. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati told AFP that Lebanon is prepared to bolster its military presence in the south once a ceasefire is established. He also noted that Israeli forces have made brief incursions across the Lebanese border. Amid these tensions, Israel has intensified its offensive in the Gaza Strip, where the United Nations warned on Tuesday that aid restrictions have reached their worst level since the conflict began over a year ago. Israel is also contemplating its response to Iran’s October 1 missile attack, which involved about 200 missiles. This attack was a retaliation for an Israeli strike in Beirut that killed Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and Iranian General Abbas Nilforoushan on September 27. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office stated that Israel — not the United States — would decide how to retaliate. U.S. President Joe Biden, whose administration is Israel’s top arms supplier, has cautioned against striking Iran’s nuclear or oil facilities to prevent a broader war. However, according to a report in The Washington Post, Netanyahu assured the U.S. that Israel would only target military sites. A subsequent statement from Netanyahu’s office reaffirmed that while Israel listens to U.S. advice, it will make final decisions based on its own 'national interest.' Meanwhile, top Iranian commander Esmail Qaani, who had been absent from the public eye, appeared at the funeral of General Nilforoushan in Tehran, dispelling rumors of his death in an Israeli strike. In Lebanon, Israeli airstrikes on Tuesday hit the eastern Bekaa Valley, putting a hospital in Baalbek out of service. Residents described it as one of the most violent nights since the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. An Israeli airstrike on the Christian-majority village of Aito on Monday reportedly killed 21 people, including 12 women and two children, according to the United Nations. The U.N. has called for a 'prompt, independent and thorough investigation' into the strike. The ongoing war in Lebanon has claimed at least 1,315 lives, according to Lebanese health ministry figures, though the actual toll is believed to be higher. The conflict has displaced at least 690,000 people, according to the International Organization for Migration. The Lebanese health ministry reported that 41 people were killed in Israeli airstrikes on Monday, bringing the total death toll since Israel’s intensified air campaign in Lebanon, which began on September 23, to 1,356.The post Hezbollah Strikes Haifa, Threatens Attacks Across All of Israel first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-strikes-haifa-threatens-attacks-across-all-israel/	2024-10-16T00:53:37-07:00	
Qassem Warns Israel: Ceasefire Is the Solution, Threatens to Targ...	Hezbollah's deputy chief, Sheikh Naim Qassem, warned on Tuesday that a ceasefire is the only solution to the ongoing war, asserting that the group will not be defeated. In a televised speech, Qassem stated that since Israel had targeted all of Lebanon, Hezbollah has the right to strike any part of Israel, including its center, north, or south. He addressed the Israeli population, saying, 'The solution is a ceasefire&#8230; Hezbollah will not be defeated because this is our land.' Qassem emphasized that Hezbollah is now focused on inflicting damage on Israel, citing recent attacks on Haifa and areas beyond, such as Tel Aviv. This was his third public appearance since Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut on September 27. 'We will defeat our enemies and drive them out of our land,' Qassem declared, accusing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of seeking to create a 'new Middle East' aligned with Israeli and U.S. interests. He encouraged Hezbollah supporters to stay resilient under Israeli bombardment, expressing hope for victory and stating that Hezbollah would ultimately 'control the reins' of the conflict. Addressing Israelis directly, Qassem said that a ceasefire is the only way for northern Israeli residents to safely return home, stressing that Hezbollah was not pushing for a ceasefire out of weakness. He warned that if Israel continues its operations in Lebanon, Hezbollah will expand its strikes, placing over 2 million people in danger. Israeli officials have stated that their military operations in Lebanon aim to push back Hezbollah and enable displaced Israelis to return home. Qassem linked the conflict in Lebanon to the broader Palestinian struggle and the war in Gaza, asserting, 'We cannot separate Lebanon from Palestine, or Palestine from the world.'The post Qassem Warns Israel: Ceasefire Is the Solution, Threatens to Target Entire Country first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/ceasefire-solution-threatens-entire-country/	2024-10-16T00:53:26-07:00	
Israel Ramps Up Tech Development to Counter Hezbollah Drone Attac...	The Israeli Defense Ministry announced that it is accelerating the development of new technologies to combat drone attacks, following a recent Hezbollah strike that killed four soldiers. While Israel's air defense systems have been effective over the past year, particularly against rocket and missile threats, they have faced challenges in dealing with drone attacks, which have caused several fatalities. In response, the Defense Ministry tested various technologies from Israeli companies as part of a fast-tracked effort to find new solutions. The ministry will review the test results and plans to select several technologies for further development, with the goal of deploying them within the coming months.The post Israel Ramps Up Tech Development to Counter Hezbollah Drone Attacks first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-ramps-tech-counter-drone-attacks/	2024-10-16T00:53:12-07:00

Watch: Breaking: US Troops Arrive in Israel to Support Missile De...	A team of U.S. troops has arrived in Israel to support the operation of a missile defense system, the Pentagon confirmed. In a statement on Monday, Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder announced that the team will operate a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery to protect against ballistic missile threats from Iran. This deployment follows two missile strikes by Iran on Israel amidst ongoing conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon. Ryder added that more U.S. military personnel and components of the THAAD battery will continue arriving in Israel over the next few days. While the system will soon be fully operational, the Pentagon did not disclose specific timelines due to security concerns. Iran has warned that U.S. forces could be at risk if it carries out further attacks on Israel.The post Watch: Breaking: US Troops Arrive in Israel to Support Missile Defense System first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-troops-arrive-israel-support-missile-system/	2024-10-15T05:54:24-07:00	
Breaking: Qatar Emir Accuses Israel of Executing ‘Pre-Existing Pl...	On Tuesday, Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani accused Israel of deliberately escalating the conflict in the Middle East to execute long-standing plans for the West Bank and Lebanon. Speaking to Qatar's Shura Council, the Emir emphasized that Israel had the option to de-escalate tensions at the Lebanon border by ending its 'war of extermination' in Gaza but instead chose to broaden its aggression. He stated that Israel is taking advantage of the situation to carry out premeditated actions in the West Bank and Lebanon, adding that the nation sees an opportunity to do so. Qatar has been actively involved in diplomatic efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and has also pushed for a truce in Lebanon, where Israeli operations against Hezbollah have intensified in recent weeks. Sheikh Tamim further mentioned that Israel's aggression has now spread to Lebanon, and violence in the West Bank has surged since Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel in October of last year. He accused Israel of using the lack of international response to push forward with dangerous settlement plans in the West Bank. In his remarks, the Qatari leader reiterated that despite the current devastation, Israel will ultimately be forced to accept the internationally endorsed two-state solution. Qatar, along with other Arab nations, has consistently called for a resolution to the Palestinian issue through the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel.The post Breaking: Qatar Emir Accuses Israel of Executing ‘Pre-Existing Plans’ in Lebanon and West Bank first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/qatar-accuses-israel-executing-pre-existing-plans-lebanon-west-bank/	2024-10-15T05:34:43-07:00	
Israeli Airstrikes Pound Eastern Lebanon Overnight	On Tuesday, Israeli forces launched airstrikes on eastern Lebanon, as reported by Lebanon's state media. This came amid ongoing clashes between Hezbollah and Israeli soldiers, following Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's vow to take aggressive action against the group. Netanyahu's statement on Monday followed a Hezbollah drone attack on an Israeli base, which resulted in the deaths of four soldiers and injuries to 60 others. He declared, 'We will continue to strike Hezbollah mercilessly across Lebanon, including in Beirut,' during a visit to a military base near Binyamina, south of Haifa. Hezbollah announced that its fighters engaged Israeli troops attempting to infiltrate near the village of Rab Tlatin. The group also launched missiles at Israeli soldiers and rockets into northern Israel, where sirens were triggered in response. In retaliation, Israel's military claimed to have killed dozens of Hezbollah fighters in close-quarters combat over the past day. The war, which intensified after Israel expanded its operations in Lebanon last month, has led to the deaths of at least 1,315 people, according to Lebanon's health ministry, though the actual toll may be higher. Early Tuesday, Israeli airstrikes targeted the eastern Bekaa Valley, which knocked a hospital in Baalbek out of service, as reported by Lebanon's National News Agency (NNA). The International Committee of the Red Cross expressed concerns about attacks on ambulances and health facilities, calling them 'deeply troubling.' Israeli strikes have also hit Hezbollah-controlled regions and other areas in Lebanon, including a predominantly Christian village in the north where at least 21 people were killed on Monday, according to Lebanon's health ministry. Rescue operations have become increasingly challenging, with civil defense chief Anis Abla in Marjayoun stating that 'rescue missions are becoming more difficult' due to the ongoing strikes targeting even the rescue workers. Israel has stated its intention to push Hezbollah back to secure its northern border, allowing residents displaced by rocket attacks to return safely. In the northern Israeli village of Kfar Kara, Yousef, a restaurant manager, expressed concerns after Hezbollah's recent attack on a nearby military base. 'Now they know where that base is, what if next time they fire and miss by a little?' he said. Hezbollah stated that its rocket attack on Tel Aviv's suburbs was a response to Israeli strikes, including one in Beirut last week that killed 22 people. Hezbollah has also said its actions are in solidarity with Hamas, following the group’s October 7 assault on Israel, which sparked the ongoing Gaza conflict. The war in Lebanon has displaced approximately 690,000 people, according to the International Organization for Migration. Meanwhile, Israel faces growing criticism over injuries sustained by UN peacekeepers deployed in Lebanon, with the U.N. Security Council expressing concern on Monday. Despite Netanyahu's request for UNIFIL (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) to withdraw, U.N. peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix confirmed that the peacekeepers will remain in place. Jordan’s King Abdullah II also cautioned that the situation could escalate into a 'regional war that will be costly for all,' during a meeting with Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati. Meanwhile, Israel is still weighing its response to an October 1 missile attack by Iran, which was launched in retaliation for Israeli operations that killed Tehran-aligned militant leaders. Reports from U.S. officials indicate that Israel is planning a counterattack targeting Iranian military sites, but avoiding nuclear and oil facilities.The post Israeli Airstrikes Pound Eastern Lebanon Overnight first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-airstrikes-pound-eastern-lebanon-overnight/	2024-10-15T05:34:31-07:00

Report: Israel Seeks 10-Km Buffer Zone in South Lebanon	Israel intends for its forces to penetrate up to three kilometers into southern Lebanon to eliminate Hezbollah's presence and withdraw after completing this mission, according to diplomatic sources. The plan is not for Israel to maintain a long-term presence in the area but to execute the operation swiftly, U.S. officials informed Lebanon, as cited by *al-Akhbar* newspaper. The Americans recognized that 'Israel is determined to turn the area into a scorched zone and is unwilling to allow anything to obstruct its efforts,' the sources indicated. While Israel has not abandoned the idea of creating a 10-kilometer buffer zone, it envisions that the remaining seven kilometers will be managed by UNIFIL and the Lebanese Army. If these forces do not meet expectations, Israel is prepared to take on the task later, the sources concluded.The post Report: Israel Seeks 10-Km Buffer Zone in South Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-seeks-10-km-buffer-zone-south-lebanon/	2024-10-15T05:33:54-07:00	
Breaking: US Deploys Anti-Missile Defense System and 100 Troops t...	The THAAD defense system is one of the U.S. military's most advanced anti-missile weapons, designed to intercept ballistic missiles at distances ranging from 150 to 200 kilometers (93 to 124 miles) with an exceptional success rate during testing. Known as the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), this system utilizes sophisticated radar and interceptor technology, making it the only U.S. missile defense system capable of engaging and neutralizing short, medium, and intermediate-range ballistic missiles both inside and outside Earth's atmosphere during their terminal flight phase. THAAD interceptors are non-explosive, destroying incoming missiles through direct impact. According to a Congressional Research Service report, the U.S. military operates seven THAAD batteries. Each battery includes six truck-mounted launchers (equipped with eight interceptors each), a powerful radar system, and a fire control and communications unit. One of these THAAD batteries is being sent to Israel to strengthen its missile defense capabilities following Iran’s missile attacks on Israel on April 13 and October 1, as reported by the Pentagon. The deployment will involve around 100 U.S. troops on the ground to operate the system. THAAD systems are designed to integrate seamlessly with other U.S. missile defenses, such as the Aegis systems aboard Navy ships and Patriot missile defense systems, further enhancing Israel’s defense capabilities. The decision to send THAAD reflects the Biden administration's emphasis on protecting Israel from further missile threats. While the Pentagon has not specified when THAAD will become operational in Israel, the system can be rapidly deployed by Air Force cargo planes like the C-17 and C-5. One key to THAAD's precision is its advanced radar system, the AN/TPY-2, which can detect and track missiles at ranges of up to 3,000 kilometers (1,865 miles) in its forward-based mode. This radar can also track missiles during their descent in terminal mode. Since Israel is approximately 1,700 kilometers (1,100 miles) from Iran, THAAD’s capabilities make it a vital asset in Israel's defense. THAAD’s deployment is expected to work in conjunction with Israel's existing missile defense systems, adding another layer of protection. Military analyst Cedric Leighton described THAAD as a 'deterrent' that will bolster Israel's air and missile defense network. Israel already possesses multiple missile defense systems, such as David’s Sling, which can intercept targets up to 300 kilometers away using Stunner and SkyCeptor interceptors. Additionally, Israel's Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 systems, co-developed with the U.S., are designed to take down ballistic missiles during their terminal and space-based phases, respectively. The Iron Dome serves as the defense against short-range projectiles with its 10 batteries and mobile missile launchers. This isn’t the first time the U.S. has sent a THAAD battery to Israel, with a similar deployment occurring in 2019 for training exercises. Globally, THAAD deployments are closely monitored by U.S. rivals. For instance, China expressed strong opposition to the THAAD deployment in South Korea in 2017, concerned that the radar could be used to monitor activities deep inside China. The U.S. has also stationed THAAD systems in Guam to protect military bases there from potential missile threats from North Korea or China.The post Breaking: US Deploys Anti-Missile Defense System and 100 Troops to Israel first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-deploys-anti-missile-defense-system-troops-israel/	2024-10-14T02:51:35-07:00	
Breaking: Israeli Airstrike Hits Gaza Hospital Courtyard, Killing...	Four people were killed on Sunday by an Israeli airstrike targeting a hospital courtyard in central Gaza, where displaced Palestinians had been seeking refuge, according to officials from Al Aqsa hospital and civil defense. The Gaza Government Media Office reported that another 40 people were injured in the strike. Approximately 5,000 people had been sheltering at the hospital grounds, according to hospital officials. The Gaza Government Media Office stated that this was the seventh time the camp within the Al-Aqsa hospital grounds in Deir al-Balah had been hit since January. The office called on the international community to intervene and pressure Israel to halt attacks against civilians. In response, the Israeli military said it carried out a targeted strike on a Hamas command center that had been situated within a compound that formerly housed the Shuhadah Al-Aqsa hospital. The military added that it took precautions to avoid civilian casualties and placed the blame on Hamas for using civilian infrastructure. Israeli airstrikes in Gaza on Sunday claimed at least 40 lives, including 13 children, with many of the injured brought to Al-Aqsa hospital for treatment.The post Breaking: Israeli Airstrike Hits Gaza Hospital Courtyard, Killing 4 and Injuring 40 first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-airstrike-hits-gaza-hospital-injuring-40/	2024-10-14T02:25:50-07:00

15 Killed in Triple Israeli Strikes Near Hezbollah Strongholds	Lebanon's health ministry announced on Saturday that Israeli airstrikes had killed at least 15 people in areas outside Hezbollah's usual strongholds, revising earlier casualty figures. In the village of Maaysra, located in Keserwan north of Beirut, the ministry reported 'nine dead and 15 wounded' from an Israeli strike, updating the initial toll of five dead. Another strike in Deir Billa, near Batroun in the north, left two people dead, four injured, and 'unidentified body parts.' Additionally, four people were killed and 18 wounded in Barja, located in the Chouf district south of Beirut, where an earlier toll had listed 14 wounded.The post 15 Killed in Triple Israeli Strikes Near Hezbollah Strongholds first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/15-killed-triple-israeli-strikes-hezbollah-strongholds/	2024-10-14T02:25:24-07:00

Drone from Lebanon Hits Israeli Base, Injures 60 Troops, Some Cri...	On Sunday, an Israeli volunteer rescue organization reported that more than 60 Israeli soldiers were injured in the area south of Haifa. This followed a drone attack claimed by Hezbollah, which targeted a military base in the region. United Hatzalah, the rescue service, stated on its Facebook page, 'With assistance from our ambulance teams, we helped over 60 individuals who sustained injuries of varying severity—ranging from critical and serious to moderate and mild.' Earlier in the day, Hezbollah, which is currently in conflict with Israel, announced that it had launched 'a squadron of attack drones' at a military training facility in Binyamina, located south of Haifa. The strike was said to be in retaliation for Israeli airstrikes, particularly on areas in Beirut, including Noueiri and Basta. This incident occurred just two days after air raid sirens were triggered in central Israel following the incursion of two drones from Lebanon. During that event, at least one building north of Tel Aviv was damaged. Hezbollah has been launching rockets and drones into Israel regularly for over a year, but the range of these attacks has increased since the conflict escalated in late September. Israel's advanced air defense systems, such as the Iron Dome, have intercepted the majority of the projectiles, minimizing casualties from the strikes or falling debris.The post Drone from Lebanon Hits Israeli Base, Injures 60 Troops, Some Critically first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/drone-lebanon-hits-israeli-base-injures-60-troops/	2024-10-14T02:24:44-07:00	
Taiwan on High Alert as Chinese Aircraft Carrier Group Detected t...	Taiwan announced it was on high alert after detecting a Chinese aircraft carrier group to its south on Sunday, shortly following a U.S. warning to Beijing against engaging in provocative actions toward the self-governed island. On Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken cautioned China not to respond aggressively to a speech given by Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te during the island's National Day celebrations. In recent years, China has escalated its military activities around Taiwan, regularly sending warplanes and other aircraft while its ships maintain a persistent presence near the island's waters. Taiwan's defense ministry confirmed on Sunday that the Chinese Liaoning aircraft carrier group had entered the Bashi Channel, a waterway that separates Taiwan from the Philippines, and was 'likely to proceed into the western Pacific.' The ministry emphasized that Taiwan's military is closely monitoring the situation using joint intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems, and remains ready to respond if necessary. On the same day, China's military released a video proclaiming its readiness for combat, which included a small map of Taiwan in the title. The footage, shared on the social media channels of the People’s Liberation Army Eastern Theater Command, showcased missiles, jets, helicopters, and warships, and declared that China’s forces were 'ready for battle at any time.' Taiwan and U.S. officials had previously warned of potential Chinese military drills in reaction to Lai's speech. The U.S. remains Taiwan's most significant supporter and primary supplier of weapons, though it does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taipei. Lai, who assumed office in May, has taken a firmer stance than his predecessor, Tsai Ing-wen, in defending Taiwan's sovereignty, which has angered Beijing, labeling him a 'separatist.' In his National Day speech, Lai pledged to 'resist annexation' and reaffirmed that Beijing and Taipei are 'not subordinate to each other.' Following Lai’s remarks, China warned that his 'provocations' would bring disaster to the people of Taiwan. Taiwan’s National Day on Thursday commemorated the 113th anniversary of the overthrow of China’s Qing dynasty and the founding of the Republic of China, which remains Taiwan's official name. The ongoing tension between China and Taiwan stems from a civil war in which Chiang Kai-shek’s nationalist forces were defeated by Mao Zedong’s communists, leading to the nationalists fleeing to Taiwan in 1949. The Democratic Progressive Party, led by Lai, has long supported Taiwan's sovereignty and democracy, while Beijing has worked to marginalize Taipei on the global stage by blocking its participation in international forums and drawing away its diplomatic allies. In the past two years, China has held three large-scale military exercises, deploying aircraft and ships to surround Taiwan. On Sunday, Taiwan’s defense ministry reported that 11 Chinese military aircraft and eight navy vessels were detected near the island in the 24 hours leading up to 6:00 a.m.The post Taiwan on High Alert as Chinese Aircraft Carrier Group Detected to the South first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/taiwan-high-alert-chinese-aircraft-carrier-group-detected/	2024-10-13T07:19:21-07:00	
Israel Targets Military and Energy Sites in Possible Retaliation ...	U.S. officials reportedly believe that Israel has refined its potential targets in response to Iran's attack earlier this month, focusing on military and energy infrastructure, according to NBC. The Middle East remains tense as Israel continues to confront Iran-backed groups, including Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. Iran, a key oil producer, has threatened severe retaliation if Israel launches an attack on its territory. Israel has vowed to respond to the missile strikes Iran launched on October 1, which were carried out in retaliation for Israel's military operations in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as the killings of senior Hamas and Hezbollah figures. However, according to the NBC report, Israel is not expected to target Iran's nuclear facilities or carry out assassinations, though no final decisions have been made on how or when Israel might act. There are speculations that Israel’s response could coincide with the ongoing Yom Kippur holiday. The Israeli government has not commented publicly on these reports. The conflict with Hezbollah, which began a year ago when the group launched rockets into northern Israel at the start of the Gaza war, has escalated significantly. Israel's military continues to operate in southern Lebanon, aiming to dismantle Hezbollah’s infrastructure. Over the past day, Israel’s air force reportedly struck around 200 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, including terrorist cells and missile launch sites. Meanwhile, Hezbollah announced that it had fired rockets at an Israeli military base in southern Haifa. Both sides have suffered casualties, with the Israeli military reporting injuries among its soldiers during combat in southern Lebanon, and Hezbollah continuing its rocket strikes deeper into Israel. The conflict has caused widespread displacement, with more than 1.2 million people forced to flee, according to Lebanon's government. Over 2,100 people have been killed and 10,000 wounded, including many women and children. In a recent phone call, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin expressed concern to Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over reports that Israeli forces had fired on U.N. peacekeeping positions in Lebanon, urging Israel to ensure the safety of peacekeepers and the Lebanese military. Five U.N. peacekeepers have been injured in the conflict. The escalating violence in the region, involving Tehran’s allied militant groups—Hezbollah, Yemen's Houthis, and armed factions in Iraq—has heightened fears of a broader conflict potentially drawing in the U.S. and Iran. Armed groups in Iraq have already claimed responsibility for drone attacks on Israeli military sites in the Golan Heights in solidarity with Palestinians and Lebanon. The ongoing war in Gaza, triggered by a Hamas-led assault on October 7, 2023, in which 1,200 Israelis were killed and about 250 were taken hostage, has resulted in more than 42,000 Palestinian deaths, according to Gaza's health ministry, as Israel continues its military campaign to eliminate Hamas.The post Israel Targets Military and Energy Sites in Possible Retaliation to Iran’s Missile Attack: Report first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-military-energy-sites-retaliation-irans/	2024-10-13T07:18:51-07:00

Geagea: Political Deadlock Must End for War Truce	Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea emphasized that electing a new president is crucial for securing a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. Lebanon has been without a president for nearly two years, during a period marked by a severe economic crisis and now intensified by Israeli airstrikes targeting Hezbollah positions. The country’s political factions, including Hezbollah's allies and their opponents like the Lebanese Forces, have been at an impasse over electing a president. Geagea, who leads the largest Christian bloc in parliament, stressed the immediate priority is achieving a ceasefire to alleviate the suffering of the Lebanese people. He remarked that without international initiatives, electing a president is the only viable path toward ending the conflict. Geagea, who has close ties with the United States and Saudi Arabia, accused Hezbollah earlier of dragging Lebanon into war with Israel, bypassing the state's authority. Since September 23, exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israel escalated into full-scale war, with Israel conducting heavy bombardments in southern and eastern Lebanon, as well as Beirut's southern suburbs, claiming to target Hezbollah sites. Geagea called for the election of a president who would be committed to fully implementing international resolutions, specifically U.N. Security Council Resolutions 1559, 1680, and 1701. Resolutions 1559 and 1680 call for the disarmament of non-state groups, while Resolution 1701, passed after the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, mandates that only the Lebanese Army and peacekeepers be armed and present in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah, founded after Israel’s siege of Beirut in 1982, remains the only group that retained its weapons following Lebanon’s civil war (1975-1990), justifying its stance as a 'resistance' against Israel. However, critics argue that Hezbollah operates as a 'state within a state.' Geagea asserted that the future president must ensure that all strategic decisions are made solely by the Lebanese state.The post Geagea: Political Deadlock Must End for War Truce first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/political-deadlock-must-end-truce/	2024-10-13T06:55:15-07:00	
Israeli Army Captures Hezbollah Fighter in South Lebanon Tunnel	The Israeli military announced on Sunday that its troops in Lebanon had captured a Hezbollah militant, marking the first such event since they initiated a cross-border ground operation. According to a military statement, 'During limited, localized, and targeted raids based on precise intelligence&#8230; soldiers discovered an underground tunnel shaft.' The troops surrounded the building, inspected the tunnel, and found an underground hideout where a Hezbollah fighter was located with weapons and equipment. While the military did not specify the exact timing of the capture, Hezbollah has yet to comment on the incident. The captured fighter reportedly surrendered to Israeli forces, who questioned him on-site before transferring him to a detention facility in Israel for further interrogation. A video accompanying the statement shows Israeli soldiers speaking in Arabic to the Hezbollah fighter, urging him to come out of the tunnel. 'Come out before your life is over,' the soldiers can be heard saying. The fighter then asked if they wanted a cigarette, to which a soldier humorously responded, 'Cigarettes, coffee, and $5,000.' The Israeli army began its ground offensive in southern Lebanon on September 30, conducting targeted raids in border villages. They have since discovered several tunnel shafts beneath homes, including one tunnel that was about 25 meters long and extended into Israeli territory.The post Israeli Army Captures Hezbollah Fighter in South Lebanon Tunnel first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-army-captures-hezbollah-fighter-lebanon-tunnel/	2024-10-13T06:55:05-07:00

Nations League: Germany Near QFs with Win Over Bosnia, 10-Man Dut...	Deniz Undav netted twice as Germany secured a 2-1 victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina on Friday, moving closer to the Nations League quarter-finals, while the Netherlands salvaged a 1-1 draw in Hungary despite being down to 10 men. Germany took the lead in Zenica when Bayer Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz provided a clever backheel assist for Undav to score after 30 minutes. Undav doubled the advantage by converting a cross from Maximilian Mittlestaedt. Bosnia pulled one back with 20 minutes to go, as 38-year-old Edin Dzeko headed in from a corner, marking his 67th international goal. 'After they scored, things got tense, but we stayed in control,' said Undav, making only his second start for Germany, in an interview with RTL. The win puts Germany on seven points from three matches, two ahead of the Netherlands. The two powerhouses will clash on Monday in Munich. 'We should have scored more, given the chances we created,' said Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann. Meanwhile, at the Puskas Arena in Budapest, a minute's silence was observed in honor of Dutch football legend Johan Neeskens, who passed away at age 73. Hungary took the lead in the 32nd minute when Roland Sallai finished from close range after a pass from Zsolt Nagy, marking a great start for coach Marco Rossi in his 69th match in charge of Hungary. The hosts looked set for a win, especially after Liverpool’s Virgil van Dijk was sent off in the 79th minute. However, just four minutes later, Denzel Dumfries headed in a free-kick from Cody Gakpo to level the score. 'Even with ten men, we pushed forward,' said Netherlands coach Ronald Koeman. 'I had a feeling we would score.' Elsewhere, Wales threw away a 2-0 halftime lead to draw 2-2 with Iceland in Reykjavik. Tottenham’s Brennan Johnson, scoring in his seventh straight game, and Harry Wilson put Wales in control, but substitute Logi Tomasson struck twice in the second half, with his second goal coming after a blunder by Wales goalkeeper Danny Ward. 'I'm genuinely happy with this performance, despite the result,' said Wales coach Craig Bellamy. 'We showed a lot of positives.' In the same group, Turkey claimed a 1-0 win over Montenegro. Meanwhile, Sweden saw a 2-0 lead slip away in a 2-2 draw with Slovakia in Bratislava, leaving both teams with seven points from three games, though Sweden leads on goal difference. Yasin Ayari and Ken Sema gave Sweden an early 2-0 advantage, but David Strelec's brace helped Slovakia fight back for a point. In other results, Tomas Chory scored twice as the Czech Republic secured a 2-0 home win over Albania. The Czechs are now level on six points with Georgia, who lost 1-0 to Ukraine after Mykhailo Mudryk’s decisive goal in the 35th minute.The post Nations League: Germany Near QFs with Win Over Bosnia, 10-Man Dutch Hold Hungary first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/germany-near-qfs-win-bosnia-dutch-hold-hungary/	2024-10-12T06:39:53-07:00	
Watch: Trump Vows to Hit India with ‘Reciprocal Tariffs’ if Re-El...	In a speech on Thursday, former US President Donald Trump pledged to implement a 'reciprocal tax' if re-elected, criticizing India for imposing the highest tariffs among major countries. Speaking in Detroit, Trump emphasized the need for reciprocity in trade, highlighting that the US does not generally charge significant tariffs, while countries like China, Brazil, and especially India, impose high tariffs on American products. 'India is a major tariff charger,' Trump said. He acknowledged the strong relationship he had with India and praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a 'great leader' who has united the country. However, Trump pointed out that India, despite its friendly approach, charges very high tariffs on foreign goods, often higher than those imposed by China. He recounted an experience during his presidency when Harley-Davidson executives visited the White House, explaining the challenges they faced in India due to the high tariffs—around 150%. Trump noted that while India encouraged Harley-Davidson to set up manufacturing within the country to avoid these charges, he expressed displeasure with the situation. He explained that such practices push companies to move operations abroad, resulting in the closure of facilities in the US. Trump referred to Modi as 'the nicest human being' and a 'friend,' but also described him as a strong, determined leader. He fondly recalled Modi's visit to Houston in 2019 for the 'Howdy Modi' event, where 80,000 people welcomed them enthusiastically. Trump also shared an anecdote about a time when someone threatened India, and he offered to assist. Modi, however, confidently declined, stating that India had dealt with such threats for centuries. Trump expressed admiration for Modi's strength and leadership, reiterating the close relationship they shared.The post Watch: Trump Vows to Hit India with ‘Reciprocal Tariffs’ if Re-Elected first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/trump-hit-india-reciprocal-tariffs-re-elected/	2024-10-12T06:38:56-07:00	
Lebanon Displacement ‘Devastating’, UN Official Warns of Insuffic...	The displacement of hundreds of thousands of people in Lebanon due to intensified Israeli bombing has been described as 'devastating' by a U.N. migration official, who also emphasized that international support is falling short of the urgent needs on the ground. After a year of intermittent cross-border fire between Israel and Hezbollah, the conflict escalated last month when Israel intensified attacks on Hezbollah positions in southern and eastern Lebanon, as well as areas in southern Beirut. These strikes came after Hezbollah launched attacks on Israel in support of its ally, Hamas, which is engaged in conflict with Israel in Gaza. According to Lebanese authorities, the violence has killed hundreds and displaced over a million people, most of them since September 23. Othman Belbeisi, the Middle East and North Africa director for the International Organization for Migration (IOM), expressed concern over the scale of the displacement and the lack of sufficient aid. 'Lebanon needs more support. What has been offered so far is minimal and does not match the needs,' he told AFP during a visit to Beirut. The IOM has verified and tracked around 690,000 internally displaced people in Lebanon, with an additional 400,000 reportedly fleeing to neighboring countries, primarily Syria. Approximately 185,000 of the displaced are housed in official shelters, such as schools, while others are renting accommodation or staying with relatives. A large number are living in informal or 'host settings,' and some have no shelter at all. The situation is dire for many of those affected, with people fleeing their homes 'with nothing, out of fear,' said Belbeisi. Many now face the daunting task of rebuilding their lives, as Israeli air strikes continue in certain areas, including southern Beirut. To address the worsening humanitarian crisis, the United Nations has launched an appeal for $426 million to assist Lebanon over the next three months, including $32 million specifically for IOM efforts to support around 400,000 displaced people. However, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported on Friday that only 12 percent of the appeal has been funded, with just $51 million received so far. Lebanon has already been grappling with a severe economic crisis for the past five years, which has crippled government services and pushed many into poverty. Belbeisi emphasized the urgency of scaling up international support, saying, 'We want this displacement to end as soon as possible.' The current wave of violence between Hezbollah and Israel began in October 2023, when Hezbollah launched cross-border attacks following the outbreak of war between Hamas and Israel. Since then, the conflict has claimed more than 2,100 lives in Lebanon, with over half of the deaths occurring in the past few weeks, according to government statistics.The post Lebanon Displacement ‘Devastating’, UN Official Warns of Insufficient Support first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lebanon-devastating-un-insufficient-support/	2024-10-12T05:56:37-07:00	
Ireland Accuses Israel of Growing Hostility Toward UN Troops	Ireland’s Foreign Minister Micheal Martin on Friday condemned an Israeli military attack in southern Lebanon that left two United Nations peacekeepers injured. On Thursday, the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, UNIFIL, reported that Israeli forces had fired on their headquarters in the region, wounding two of the peacekeepers. Prime Minister Simon Harris expressed his deep concern about the incident, while Martin, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, described it as 'an extraordinary and shocking development.' 'This represents a significant escalation of hostility by the IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) against U.N. forces and posts. It is absolutely unacceptable. The actions over the past 48 hours have been reckless and intimidating,' Martin said. Ireland contributes 347 troops to the 10,000-strong UNIFIL mission, which is responsible for maintaining peace in southern Lebanon. Speaking to reporters in southwest Ireland, Martin called for the international community to take a stand and 'send a clear message to Israel that this behavior is unacceptable.' He emphasized the need for collective action, urging the global community to engage with Israel to halt such activities and ensure the safety of U.N. peacekeepers. UNIFIL had earlier expressed concern about Israeli troops operating near an outpost manned by Irish soldiers, adding to the growing unease over the situation.The post Ireland Accuses Israel of Growing Hostility Toward UN Troops first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/ireland-accuses-israel-hostility-un-troops/	2024-10-12T05:55:51-07:00	
New Israeli Attack Injures UN Peacekeepers in South Lebanon	On Friday, Lebanon condemned an Israeli attack that reportedly injured United Nations peacekeepers in the country's south, marking the second such incident in two days, according to state media. In an official statement, Lebanon's foreign ministry denounced 'the targeting by the Israeli army' of the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). The statement said the attack hit 'watchtowers, the main UNIFIL base in Ras Naqoura, and the Sri Lankan battalion’s base, causing several injuries.' The National News Agency reported that an Israeli 'Merkava tank' fired at one of UNIFIL’s observation towers on the road between Tyre and Naqoura, wounding personnel from the Sri Lankan battalion. The report added that Israeli forces also 'fired an artillery shell at the entrance of the UNIFIL command center in Naqoura, damaging the entrance.' Later in the day, UNIFIL confirmed that its Naqoura headquarters had been 'affected by explosions for the second time in 48 hours.' The statement revealed that two peacekeepers were injured when explosions occurred near an observation tower. One was taken to a hospital in Tyre, while the other was treated on-site in Naqoura. UNIFIL also reported an incident where several T-walls at their position in Labbouneh collapsed after an Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) caterpillar hit the perimeter, with IDF tanks moving close to the U.N. position. Despite the incident, UNIFIL peacekeepers remained at the location, and a Quick Reaction Force was sent to assist. UNIFIL emphasized that these incidents put peacekeepers serving under U.N. Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) at serious risk, warning that any deliberate attack on peacekeepers constitutes a grave violation of international humanitarian law. The force reiterated that the safety and security of U.N. personnel must be upheld and that U.N. premises should always be respected. On Thursday, two UNIFIL peacekeepers were injured in an earlier Israeli attack on their headquarters. Israel acknowledged that its forces opened fire in the area, claiming Hezbollah militants were operating near U.N. posts. UNIFIL, which has about 10,000 peacekeepers in southern Lebanon, has been calling for a ceasefire since September 23, following nearly a year of cross-border conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. The injured peacekeepers from Thursday’s attack, both from Indonesia, are still receiving treatment, though their injuries were not life-threatening.The post New Israeli Attack Injures UN Peacekeepers in South Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/new-israeli-attack-injures-un-peacekeepers/	2024-10-12T05:55:27-07:00	
France Summons Israeli Envoy Over Attack on UNIFIL Peacekeepers	France announced on Friday that it had summoned the Israeli ambassador in response to reports from U.N. peacekeepers in Lebanon that Israeli fire had struck their headquarters, injuring two staff members. 'These attacks represent significant breaches of international law and must come to an immediate halt,' stated the French foreign ministry. 'Israeli authorities need to provide an explanation for their actions.' As a result, the French government has called in the Israeli ambassador to discuss the matter further.The post France Summons Israeli Envoy Over Attack on UNIFIL Peacekeepers first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/france-summons-israeli-envoy-attack-unifil/	2024-10-12T05:54:23-07:00	
Hochstein: Working ‘Non-Stop’ to Secure Lebanon Ceasefire	The U.S. special envoy to Lebanon, Amos Hochstein, expressed that the United States is working tirelessly towards achieving a ceasefire in Lebanon. Speaking to local media, Hochstein emphasized, 'We want the entire conflict to come to an end,' in an interview with the Lebanese TV channel LBCI from Washington, adding, 'We are working on this non-stop.' Israel has intensified its strikes, targeting what it claims are Hezbollah positions, since September 23. This escalation, following nearly a year of cross-border fire, has led to the deaths of more than 1,200 people and displaced around a million from their homes. Reflecting on the situation, Hochstein condemned reports of Israeli strikes on U.N. peacekeeping posts in southern Lebanon on Friday, calling them 'unacceptable.' He also offered his condolences to the families of two Lebanese soldiers who were reportedly killed by Israeli airstrikes in the country's south on the same day. Israeli attacks have hit various areas across Lebanon, including the south, the east, and Beirut’s southern suburbs. There have also been three deadly airstrikes on central Beirut. Hochstein specifically condemned Thursday's strikes in the Beirut districts of Basta and Nweiri, which killed 22 people, calling them 'totally unacceptable.' 'We're facing an ongoing bombing campaign in Beirut, and it has to stop,' Hochstein stated. 'We’re actively working to put an end to these bombings, especially in densely populated areas of Beirut.' Earlier that same day, Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister, Najib Mikati, called on the United Nations to issue a resolution demanding an 'immediate' ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah.The post Hochstein: Working ‘Non-Stop’ to Secure Lebanon Ceasefire first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/working-non-stop-secure-lebanon-ceasefire/	2024-10-12T05:53:51-07:00
