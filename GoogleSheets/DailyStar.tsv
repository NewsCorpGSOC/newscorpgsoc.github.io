Israeli strikes on Gaza homes kill at least 58 Palestinians	The fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, established in January 2025, collapsed on March 18, leading to a significant escalation in violence across the Gaza Strip. Israeli airstrikes targeted various locations, resulting in substantial casualties and widespread destruction. In the early hours of March 18, Israeli forces launched a series of airstrikes across Gaza, marking one of the deadliest days since the conflict began in 2023. The Gaza Health Ministry reported over 400 Palestinian deaths, including 183 children and 94 women. These strikes devastated residential areas, with entire families among the casualties. For instance, a pregnant woman and her young son were killed when their tent was hit in a camp near Khan Younis. The Israeli military stated that the operations aimed to target Hamas leaders and infrastructure. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasized that the strikes were 'only the beginning' and that military actions would intensify until all hostages were released and Hamas relinquished control over Gaza. Ground Operations and Humanitarian Impact Alongside airstrikes, Israeli ground troops advanced into Gaza, reclaiming previously ceded territories and effectively splitting the region by retaking control of the Netzarim corridor. Defense Minister Israel Katz warned of the complete destruction of Gaza if Hamas did not comply with demands. The renewed conflict has exacerbated the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Over 160,000 Palestinians have been displaced, many forced to flee their homes for the second time in months. Essential services, including hospitals, are overwhelmed, with more than 80% of medical facilities out of service. The lack of access to food, water, and medical supplies has led to severe shortages, further endangering civilian lives. The international community has expressed grave concern over the escalating violence. The United Nations condemned the attacks, especially after a UN staff member was killed and five others injured in a strike on a UN guesthouse in Gaza. UN Secretary-General António Guterres called for an immediate investigation, emphasizing the need to protect UN premises under international law. France also condemned the Israeli airstrikes, highlighting the numerous civilian casualties and urging an immediate ceasefire. citeturn0search17 Similarly, other nations and international organizations have called for restraint and the protection of civilians, advocating for renewed negotiations to achieve a lasting peace.

Report: Ortagus warns Aoun and Salam of Israeli military freedom	During a recent visit to Lebanon, U.S. Deputy Special Envoy for Middle East Peace, Morgan Ortagus, conveyed a firm message regarding Hezbollah's involvement in the Lebanese government. In meetings with President Joseph Aoun and Prime Minister-designate Nawaf Salam, Ortagus emphasized that the United States considers Hezbollah's participation in the new government a 'red line.' She expressed gratitude to Israel for its actions against Hezbollah and underscored the U.S. commitment to preventing the group from influencing Lebanon's political landscape. In response, President Aoun's office issued a statement clarifying that Ortagus's remarks reflected her personal views and did not represent the official position of the Lebanese presidency. The statement emphasized Lebanon's sovereignty in making decisions about its internal affairs. Hezbollah and its allies reacted strongly to Ortagus's statements. Senior figures within the group reiterated Hezbollah's significant role in Lebanon's political and social spheres, rejecting external interference in the country's governance. They emphasized that Hezbollah represents a substantial segment of the Lebanese population and should not be excluded from the political process. Prime Minister-designate Nawaf Salam faces the complex task of forming a new government amid these external pressures and internal divisions. The U.S. stance adds another layer of complexity to Lebanon's sectarian-based political system, where power-sharing among various religious and political groups is delicate. Salam's efforts to balance these interests while addressing international concerns will be crucial in the coming weeks. Ortagus's visit and statements occur against a backdrop of heightened regional tensions. Recent Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon and ongoing disputes over border demarcations have further strained relations. The U.S. continues to support Israel's security concerns while advocating for Lebanon's stability and sovereignty, creating a delicate diplomatic balancing act. The U.S. envoy's recent visit to Lebanon has spotlighted the intricate interplay between domestic politics and international diplomacy. As Lebanon endeavors to form a new government capable of implementing necessary reforms and ensuring stability, it must navigate external pressures and internal dynamics to achieve a cohesive and representative administration.The post Report: Ortagus warns Aoun and Salam of Israeli military freedom first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/ortagus-warns-aoun-salam-israeli-military/	2025-03-20T10:30:05-07:00	
Hamas open to talks as Israel intensifies Gaza strikes	After a fragile ceasefire that began in January, hostilities have reignited between Israel and Hamas. The truce unraveled following disagreements over hostage releases and ceasefire terms. Israel accused Hamas of refusing to release remaining hostages, prompting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to declare the resumption of military operations. Netanyahu emphasized that negotiations would now proceed 'only under fire,' signaling a shift in Israel's approach. In response, Israel launched a series of airstrikes across the Gaza Strip, marking the most significant assault since the ceasefire commenced. These strikes resulted in substantial casualties, with reports indicating over 400 fatalities and numerous injuries. The bombardments targeted various locations, including densely populated areas, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in the region. Concurrently, the Israeli military initiated a ground operation aimed at reclaiming strategic positions in northern Gaza, specifically the Netzarim corridor. This move underscores Israel's intent to apply increased pressure on Hamas and regain control over critical territories. The international community has expressed deep concern over the escalating violence. Countries worldwide have condemned the rising civilian death toll and called for an immediate cessation of hostilities. Turkey, for instance, announced plans to intensify diplomatic efforts to reinstate the Gaza ceasefire and halt the ongoing bloodshed. Despite the escalation, Hamas has signaled openness to negotiations to restore the ceasefire but remains firm against renegotiating the original terms established in January. Hamas official Taher al-Nounou stated that while the group is open to talks, there is no need for new agreements, emphasizing the importance of adhering to the existing accord. The resurgence of conflict has severely impacted Gaza's already fragile humanitarian situation. Medical facilities, many of which were already operating under strained conditions, are now overwhelmed with casualties. The destruction of infrastructure has further hampered aid delivery, exacerbating the plight of civilians caught in the crossfire.The post Hamas open to talks as Israel intensifies Gaza strikes first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hamas-talks-israel-intensifies-gaza-strikes/	2025-03-19T09:02:55-07:00	
Army secures Hawsh al-Sayyed Ali, shuts down four illegal border ...	On Wednesday, the Lebanese Army advanced into the Lebanese sector of Hawsh al-Sayyed Ali following the withdrawal of Syrian forces. This strategic move involved the deployment of 60 military vehicles and the establishment of security checkpoints throughout the town, aiming to reinforce stability in the area. The region has experienced heightened tensions due to recent clashes between Lebanese clans and Syrian forces in Hawsh al-Sayyed Ali and the nearby Syrian town of al-Mesherfeh. These confrontations resulted in casualties, including the deaths of two Lebanese citizens whose bodies were retrieved by Lebanese army intelligence through coordination at the Jousiyeh border crossing. In response to these developments, the Lebanese Army has intensified its security measures by closing illegal border crossings in the al-Qasr-Hermel and Masharii al-Qaa-Baalbek areas. Additionally, coordinated efforts between Lebanese and Syrian authorities have led to increased patrols in the Hermel region, aiming to maintain security and stability along the border.The post Army secures Hawsh al-Sayyed Ali, shuts down four illegal border crossings first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/army-secures-hawsh-al-sayyed-ali-shuts-illegal-crossings/	2025-03-19T09:02:42-07:00	
Reports: Two Lebanese executed after abduction by Syrian forces	Tensions along the Lebanon-Syria border have escalated following the abduction and killing of Lebanese nationals by Syrian General Security forces. According to reports, two Lebanese men, identified as M.N.M. and A.N.M., were taken from their residence in the al-Fadliyeh area within Lebanese territory. Their bodies were later discovered in the al-Sadd-Matraba region near the Syrian border, both having suffered fatal knife wounds. This incident occurred shortly after three Syrian soldiers were killed during confrontations with Lebanese armed groups along the border. In response to these events, both the Lebanese and Syrian armies have initiated communication efforts to de-escalate the situation. The Lebanese military has increased its presence in the area, deploying additional troops to maintain order. The heightened tensions have led families residing in border regions to seek safety in more secure locations, as overnight clashes and shelling have raised concerns about civilian safety. Accusations and Denials Syria's interim government has accused militants from the Lebanese group Hezbollah of crossing into northeastern Lebanon, abducting three Syrian soldiers, and subsequently killing them on Lebanese soil. Hezbollah has officially denied any involvement in these incidents. Some reports suggest that Lebanese clans or smugglers may have been involved in the recent fighting, adding complexity to the situation. Syrian state media, referencing an unnamed Defense Ministry official, reported that the Syrian army targeted 'Hezbollah gatherings' along the border in retaliation for the deaths of the Syrian soldiers. While clashes have largely subsided before sunrise, there have been reports of sporadic low-level fighting, including an attack on a Syrian military vehicle. The exact number of casualties remains unclear. The Lebanese military has reportedly handed over the bodies of the three deceased Syrian soldiers to their counterparts. Additionally, there are reports indicating that one of the soldiers may have been killed in a particularly brutal manner. The situation remains fluid, with both nations' militaries on high alert to prevent further escalation. The international community is closely monitoring developments, urging restraint and dialogue to resolve the tensions along the Lebanon-Syria border.The post Reports: Two Lebanese executed after abduction by Syrian forces first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/two-lebanese-executed-abduction-syrian-forces/	2025-03-17T10:58:49-07:00	
Israeli drone strike kills one in Yohmor al-Shaqif	On Monday, an Israeli drone strike targeted the town of Yohmor al-Shaqif in Lebanon's Nabatieh governorate, resulting in one fatality and three injuries, as reported by the Health Ministry and the National News Agency (NNA). The attack occurred on Hay al-Baydar road, where a guided missile struck a motorbike carrying two individuals. Shrapnel from the explosion also damaged a passing van, igniting it, and caused a fire in a nearby supermarket. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) stated that the strike targeted two Hezbollah members allegedly acting as observation operatives and coordinating militant operations in the Yohmor al-Shaqif area. In related developments, an airstrike hit the outskirts of Ainata overnight, resulting in two deaths. An Israeli Apache helicopter also attacked three prefabricated structures in Kfarkela, a southern border town. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz justified the Ainata strike, claiming it was a response to a stray bullet from a Hezbollah operative's funeral that struck a vehicle's windshield in Avivim, a northern Israeli community. Katz emphasized that Israel would respond forcefully to any ceasefire violations, stating that shooting from Lebanese territory toward northern communities would not be tolerated. The IDF further reported targeting a headquarters of Hezbollah's Radwan force and other Hezbollah facilities in southern Lebanon. Additionally, a helicopter conducted a second strike on the outskirts of Yaroun. A truce established on November 27 largely halted over a year of hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel, including a two-month war involving Israeli ground troops. Despite the ceasefire, Israel has continued near-daily strikes on Lebanese territory. Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon, initially scheduled for January and then February 18, remains incomplete, with troops still stationed at five strategic locations. The ceasefire agreement also mandated Hezbollah's withdrawal north of the Litani River, approximately 30 kilometers from the border, and the dismantling of remaining military infrastructure in the south.The post Israeli drone strike kills one in Yohmor al-Shaqif first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-drone-strike-kills-one-yohmor-al-shaqif/	2025-03-17T10:58:40-07:00	
Iran denies aiding Houthis after US strikes and Trump threat	Iran has once again dismissed claims that it is aiding Yemen’s Houthi rebels following a series of U.S. airstrikes against the group. The strikes were carried out after President Donald Trump warned that Tehran would be held fully responsible for the Houthis’ actions. According to the Houthi-run Health Ministry, the airstrikes resulted in the deaths of at least 31 people, including women and children, and left more than 100 others injured. The rebels reported that one of the strikes hit two homes in northern Saada province, killing four children and a woman. Their Al-Masirah TV channel aired footage showing what it claimed were the victims of the attack. The Houthis have previously targeted international shipping in the Red Sea and launched missile and drone attacks against Israel, which they said were in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. The attacks had ceased following the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in January, but the Houthis recently threatened to resume them after Israel restricted humanitarian aid to Gaza. U.S. Accusations and Iran’s Response The U.S. has long accused Iran of supplying military support to the Houthis. American naval forces have intercepted shipments of Iranian-made missile components and weapons allegedly bound for the militant group, which controls northern Yemen and the capital, Sanaa. However, Gen. Hossein Salami, commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, rejected the accusations, stating that Iran does not dictate the operational policies of its regional allies. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi also called for an end to U.S. airstrikes, insisting that Washington cannot impose its will on Iran’s foreign policy. U.S. Military Action and Maritime Security President Trump reaffirmed his administration’s commitment to using overwhelming force until the Houthis end their attacks on maritime traffic in the Red Sea. The latest U.S. airstrikes followed renewed threats from the Houthis to resume attacks on Israeli-linked vessels in response to Israel’s continued blockade of Gaza. During their previous campaign, the Houthis targeted over 100 merchant ships with missiles and drones, sinking two and causing the deaths of four sailors between October 2023 and January 2024, when the ceasefire in Gaza took effect. While the U.S., Israel, and the U.K. have previously launched joint strikes against Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen, the latest operation was carried out solely by the United States. It marked the first U.S. strike against the Houthis under Trump’s second administration.The post Iran denies aiding Houthis after US strikes and Trump threat first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/iran-denies-aiding-houthis-us-strikes/	2025-03-16T03:11:31-07:00	
Turkey-Israel tensions rise over post-Assad Syria	Tensions between Turkey and Israel have intensified following the collapse of Bashar al-Assad's government in Syria, with both nations pursuing opposing strategies in the region. Their conflicting objectives are increasingly placing them on a potential collision course. Turkey has positioned itself as a key actor in Syria, advocating for a stable and unified country under a central government. It recently welcomed an agreement between Syria’s new interim leadership and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which aims to integrate Kurdish forces into the national army. Turkey has long opposed Assad and backed various groups that fought against his rule. Israel, however, remains skeptical of Syria’s interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, citing his ties to al-Qaida. The Israeli government is wary of Turkey's growing influence in Syria and appears to prefer a fragmented Syria rather than a centralized state, fearing it could once again become a launchpad for Iranian-backed forces. Following Assad's fall, Israel moved to seize control of key areas in southern Syria, arguing it was necessary to keep hostile factions away from its borders. However, Syria's interim government and the United Nations have condemned Israel’s actions, citing violations of a 1974 ceasefire agreement. Israel has also carried out targeted airstrikes on military infrastructure left behind by Assad’s forces and has signaled its intention to maintain a presence in the region. Rising Tensions and Military Concerns Israel is particularly concerned about Turkey’s expanding military footprint in Syria. Since 2016, Turkey has conducted multiple military operations in northern Syria, primarily to counter Kurdish militias linked to the banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). Ankara continues to maintain a significant military presence in the north through both bases and alliances with anti-Assad groups. Meanwhile, Turkey and Syria’s interim government have initiated defense and security cooperation, with a Turkish military delegation expected to visit Syria soon. Israeli officials, however, have drawn a red line, warning they will not tolerate a Syrian military presence south of Damascus. They have even threatened to send forces into a Damascus suburb to protect the Druze minority, particularly after clashes between Druze militias and Syria’s new security forces. Turkey and Israel were once close allies, but their relationship has deteriorated over the past two decades, particularly under Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. His vocal opposition to Israeli policies toward the Palestinians, along with Turkey’s support for Hamas, has fueled tensions. Geopolitical Implications Following the conflict in Gaza, Turkey took strong action against Israel, including cutting trade ties and joining South Africa’s genocide case against Israel at the UN International Court of Justice. Turkish officials are also increasingly concerned that Israel is backing Kurdish, Druze, and Alawite autonomy movements within Syria. Erdogan recently issued a warning, stating that any attempts to exploit ethnic or religious divisions in Syria would not succeed. His comments came in the wake of sectarian violence, where pro-Assad groups attacked government security forces, prompting retaliation from factions aligned with Syria’s new leadership, allegedly backed by Turkey. Hundreds of civilians were reported killed in the clashes. Israel’s response has been equally strong, with Deputy Foreign Minister Sharren Haskel condemning what she described as 'ethnic cleansing' by Islamist groups now in power in Damascus. She accused Turkey of supporting jihadist forces and stressed Israel’s commitment to countering any security threats emerging from Syria. Amid growing tensions, Israel has deepened its involvement in Syria, pledging support and economic assistance to the Druze community. Israeli officials argue that their aid efforts in southern Syria are humanitarian in nature, while critics accuse them of using the situation to justify intervention. Although Syria’s new president initially adopted a cautious stance toward Israel, his rhetoric has shifted, now calling Israeli actions a threat to regional security. With both Turkey and Israel actively maneuvering to secure their interests, experts warn that miscalculations could lead to direct confrontation. Analysts suggest that Israel and Turkey could benefit from diplomatic engagement, particularly given Turkey’s influence over Syria’s leadership. Without efforts to de-escalate, Syria may soon become the focal point of yet another regional conflict.The post Turkey-Israel tensions rise over post-Assad Syria first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/turkey-israel-tensions-rise-post-assad-syria/	2025-03-16T03:11:09-07:00	
Hamas to release US-Israeli hostage to push ceasefire talks forwa...	Hamas has announced its agreement to a mediator-backed proposal to release one living American-Israeli hostage along with the bodies of four others who died while in captivity. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office expressed skepticism about the offer, accusing Hamas of attempting to manipulate the negotiations currently taking place in Qatar regarding the next phase of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. The militant group did not specify when the release of soldier Edan Alexander and the remains of the four other hostages would take place or what it expected in return. Alexander was 19 years old when he was captured during the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, which triggered the ongoing conflict. It remains unclear which mediators proposed the release deal, but the United States, led by special hostage envoy Steve Witkoff, has been actively pushing for an agreement that would extend the ceasefire and facilitate limited hostage-prisoner exchanges. Following Hamas' statement, Netanyahu's office asserted that Israel had already agreed to the proposal and had shown flexibility in negotiations, but accused Hamas of refusing to make concessions. The Israeli government also claimed that Hamas' announcement regarding the release of an American hostage was an attempt to disrupt the negotiations. Netanyahu is expected to meet with his ministerial team to receive an update on the discussions and determine the next steps. Ongoing Ceasefire Talks and Humanitarian Crisis The ceasefire, which temporarily halted intense fighting between Israel and Hamas, saw 25 hostages returned alive along with the remains of eight others in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. During this period, Israeli forces withdrew to buffer zones within Gaza, allowing displaced Palestinians to return to the northern areas. The ceasefire also enabled hundreds of aid trucks to enter Gaza daily, although Israel later suspended deliveries. Israel has been pressuring Hamas to release half of the remaining hostages in exchange for an extension of the ceasefire and discussions about a permanent truce. According to Israeli intelligence, Hamas is holding 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others. In response to Hamas’ reluctance to agree to Israel’s terms, the Israeli government cut off all aid to Gaza, affecting the region's over two million residents. Hamas has warned that the blockade could also impact the remaining hostages. Hamas is pushing to move forward with negotiations for the next phase of the ceasefire, which would include the release of the remaining captives, the withdrawal of Israeli forces, and a lasting resolution to the conflict. The militant group has stated that the blockade has led to a humanitarian crisis, with 80% of the population losing access to food and 90% struggling to find clean drinking water due to halted aid deliveries and empty markets. Restrictions at Al-Aqsa Mosque Meanwhile, in Jerusalem, an estimated 80,000 Muslim worshippers gathered at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound for the second Friday of Ramadan, according to the Islamic Trust that oversees the site. Israeli authorities have tightened entry restrictions, only allowing men over 55 and women over 50 from the occupied territories to attend prayers. Palestinians have expressed frustration over the limitations, with some describing the journey to Jerusalem as increasingly difficult. Hamas has accused Israel of escalating a 'religious war' by imposing these restrictions, arguing that they are part of a broader effort to control Muslim religious practices at Al-Aqsa.The post Hamas to release US-Israeli hostage to push ceasefire talks forward first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hamas-release-us-israeli-hostage/	2025-03-14T10:46:07-07:00	
Berri vows Lebanon will never cede ‘an inch’ of land	Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri reaffirmed on Friday that Lebanon will not relinquish any part of its land under any circumstances. His remarks came in response to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s statement that Israeli forces would continue occupying five elevated positions in southern Lebanon. Berri emphasized that Lebanon will take all necessary measures to safeguard its sovereignty and reclaim any occupied land. He stressed that defending Lebanon, particularly the south, is a collective national duty and should be a unifying cause. He added that unity among Lebanese factions is crucial in overcoming any challenges. Netanyahu declared on Thursday that Israel has no intention of withdrawing from five key locations on the Lebanese side of the border, which he described as 'strategic hills' essential for national security. He insisted that Israeli forces would maintain their presence at these positions to protect Israeli territory. Meanwhile, U.S. Deputy Special Envoy for the Middle East Morgan Ortagus recently announced that Washington is working to facilitate negotiations between Lebanon and Israel to resolve outstanding border disputes and security concerns. The planned discussions are set to address Israeli military presence at the five disputed sites, the release of Lebanese detainees, and other unresolved territorial disagreements along the Blue Line. Ceasefire Commitments and Delayed Withdrawal As part of the ceasefire agreement reached in late November, Hezbollah had agreed to pull back north of the Litani River and dismantle its military infrastructure in southern Lebanon. In return, Israel was expected to complete its withdrawal from all Lebanese territory by February 18. However, Israeli forces have continued to occupy the five positions they consider strategically significant, prolonging tensions in the region.The post Berri vows Lebanon will never cede ‘an inch’ of land first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/berri-lebanon-never-cede-inch/	2025-03-14T10:45:57-07:00	
Israel strike on Damascus building kills one	Israel’s military launched an airstrike targeting a residential building on the outskirts of Damascus, claiming it was a command center for the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group. The military stated that the facility had been used to orchestrate attacks against Israel and warned of further military action against Palestinian factions operating within Syria. The attack took place in Dummar, a suburb northwest of the Syrian capital. According to reports from a war monitoring organization, at least one person was killed in the strike. Israel's Defense Minister issued a warning, stating that Syria’s new president would face continued airstrikes if terrorist activities against Israel were organized from within the country. A member of Palestinian Islamic Jihad who was at the site claimed that the targeted building was the residence of the group’s leader, Ziad Nakhaleh. However, he stated that the apartment had been unoccupied for years and that Nakhaleh was not in Syria at the time. It remains unclear where Nakhaleh is currently located, but he is believed to split his time between Lebanon, Iran, and Syria. Meanwhile, Syria’s state news agency confirmed that an Israeli airstrike had hit a residential building near Damascus but provided no further details on the incident.The post Israel strike on Damascus building kills one first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-strike-damascus-kills-one/	2025-03-13T10:38:23-07:00	
Cabinet approves new army commander and security chiefs	The Cabinet has confirmed key security and military appointments, naming Brig. Gen. Rudolph Haykal as army chief, Brig. Gen. Hassan Shqeir to lead General Security, Brig. Gen. Raed Abdallah as head of the Internal Security Forces, and Brig. Gen. Edgard Lawandos to oversee State Security. Following the Cabinet session, Information Minister Paul Morkos emphasized that these appointments were based on expertise and competence, highlighting the government’s commitment to selecting leaders with strong professional credentials. In addition to these appointments, the government has approved the recruitment of 4,500 soldiers into the army, which will take place in three separate phases. Morkos also revealed that a special Cabinet meeting is scheduled for Monday to establish a structured approach for future administrative appointments, ensuring a transparent and standardized process. Financial and Security Concerns As part of ongoing financial planning, a draft law aimed at reducing fees in the 2025 state budget has been prepared. The session also included discussions on economic policies, with President Joseph Aoun addressing the importance of implementing reforms tied to International Monetary Fund recommendations. The IMF delegation has stressed the urgency of appointing a central bank governor and making further amendments to the banking secrecy law, along with enacting the banking restructuring law. On security matters, Aoun reassured officials that Lebanese authorities are closely monitoring developments in Syria. He affirmed that security agencies remain on high alert, prepared to respond to any potential regional threats.The post Cabinet approves new army commander and security chiefs first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/cabinet-approves-army-commander-security-chiefs/	2025-03-13T10:38:16-07:00	
Iran expects Trump letter soon	Iran’s foreign minister has confirmed that an Arab nation is set to deliver a letter from US President Donald Trump, who has expressed interest in negotiating a new nuclear agreement with Tehran. Speaking after a cabinet meeting, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated that while the letter has yet to arrive, arrangements are in place for its delivery to Tehran in the near future. However, he did not specify which Arab country is acting as the intermediary or when exactly the message will be received. Iran Rejects Talks Under Pressure Last week, Trump revealed that he had written directly to Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, urging negotiations on a revised nuclear deal. He warned that if Tehran refuses to engage, military options remain on the table. Iran, however, has consistently dismissed the idea of negotiating while facing economic and political pressure. After his return to the White House, Trump reinstated the 'maximum pressure' strategy, which included withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear deal in 2018 and imposing tough economic sanctions on Tehran. Supreme Leader Khamenei has advised the Iranian government against engaging in talks with Washington, citing a lack of trust following the US withdrawal from the previous agreement. He also criticized what he described as coercive diplomatic tactics, arguing that some governments push for negotiations not to resolve disputes, but as a means of asserting control.The post Iran expects Trump letter soon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/iran-expects-trump-letter-soon/	2025-03-12T09:37:24-07:00

Israel and Lebanon agree to land border talks after US push	Israel and Lebanon have agreed to engage in negotiations to address their long-standing land border disputes, marking a significant diplomatic breakthrough. The decision comes following mediation efforts led by US officials, who played a key role in bringing both sides to the table. The discussions will focus on resolving thirteen disputed points along the Blue Line, a boundary established by the United Nations in 2000 to mark Israel’s withdrawal from southern Lebanon. These areas have been a continuous source of tension, often leading to cross-border clashes. The talks aim to build on the ceasefire agreement brokered last November, which ended months of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah. The recent push for border negotiations is intended to strengthen stability in the region and create a framework for peaceful coexistence. Key Elements of the Negotiations As part of the agreement, trilateral working groups will be formed, bringing together representatives from Israel, Lebanon, and the United States to oversee discussions on: Border disputes – addressing the territorial disagreements along the Blue Line Lebanese prisoners – reviewing the status and potential release of Lebanese detainees held by Israel Israeli military outposts – discussing the conditions for Israel’s withdrawal from its remaining five positions in southern Lebanon In a move to signal its commitment to the negotiations, Israel has released five Lebanese detainees, including a Hezbollah member captured during last year’s conflict. The Israeli Prime Minister’s office stated that the decision was made as a goodwill gesture towards Lebanon’s newly elected President, Joseph Aoun. The US has played an active role in fostering dialogue between the two nations, building on its previous success in mediating the 2022 maritime border agreement between Israel and Lebanon. Officials hope that these latest talks will further reduce tensions and pave the way for a long-term resolution to territorial disputes. Negotiations are expected to begin as early as next month, marking a crucial step towards diplomatic progress in the region.The post Israel and Lebanon agree to land border talks after US push first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-lebanon-border-talks-us-push/	2025-03-11T10:31:10-07:00	
Ortagus: US to mediate Lebanon-Israel talks on key disputes	The United States has announced efforts to bring Lebanon and Israel together for diplomatic discussions aimed at settling several unresolved issues between the two nations. The talks will focus on key topics, including the release of Lebanese prisoners, the resolution of disputed border points along the Blue Line, and the status of five areas where Israeli forces remain stationed. Deputy U.S. Special Envoy for the Middle East, Morgan Ortagus, confirmed that military-to-military talks were successfully concluded in Naqoura, Lebanon. As a result, five Lebanese prisoners have been returned from Israel to Lebanon. Ortagus emphasized that all parties involved remain committed to upholding the ceasefire agreement and implementing its terms fully. She also highlighted that diplomatic working groups will soon be established to address the remaining issues, with the support of international partners. Prisoner Release and Border Negotiations Speaking in an interview, Ortagus revealed that the five released Lebanese prisoners included a combination of civilians and soldiers, though she noted that it would be up to the Lebanese government to disclose further details. Meanwhile, Nizar Zakka, head of the U.S.-based Hostage Aid Worldwide organization, confirmed that among the freed individuals were four civilians and a Hezbollah member. In return, Lebanon has agreed to begin formal negotiations on demarcating its land border with Israel, specifically addressing the 13 unresolved points along the Blue Line. This development marks a significant step towards easing tensions between the two countries and addressing long-standing territorial disputes through diplomatic engagement.The post Ortagus: US to mediate Lebanon-Israel talks on key disputes first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/ortagus-us-mediate-lebanon-israel-talks/	2025-03-11T10:31:01-07:00	
Iran refuses talks under ‘intimidation’ as Trump ups pressure	Iran has firmly stated that it will not engage in negotiations under coercion, following a decision by U.S. President Donald Trump to escalate economic pressure by terminating a sanctions waiver that had permitted Iraq to purchase electricity from Iran. While Iran’s mission to the United Nations had hinted at the possibility of talks to address U.S. concerns about its nuclear program, Iranian officials quickly dismissed any notion of concessions. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi made it clear that Tehran sees its nuclear program as entirely peaceful and will not entertain discussions under external pressure. Through a statement on social media, Araghchi reinforced that Iran refuses to negotiate under intimidation, asserting that discussions would not even be considered under such conditions, regardless of the subject. Since returning to the presidency in January, Trump has reinstated his administration’s 'maximum pressure' strategy against Iran, reimposing extensive sanctions primarily aimed at crippling the country’s oil sector. The latest decision to revoke Iraq’s sanctions waiver aligns with this approach, with the U.S. State Department emphasizing the goal of preventing Iran from gaining any economic relief. Economic and Energy Ramifications for Iraq The revoked waiver, originally introduced in 2018 when Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal, allowed Iraq to continue importing Iranian gas and electricity—essential for sustaining its national power grid. Iran supplies roughly one-third of Iraq’s energy, a crucial revenue stream that Washington now aims to cut off. The U.S. embassy in Baghdad has urged Iraq to find alternative energy sources and reduce its reliance on Iranian imports. However, despite its vast oil and gas reserves, Iraq remains heavily dependent on energy imports, and the decision is expected to exacerbate the country's ongoing electricity shortages, particularly affecting its 46 million residents. Baghdad has stated that it has prepared for 'all scenarios' in response to the waiver’s expiration. Analysts suggest Iraq could mitigate some of the impact by increasing imports from Turkey or seeking alternative energy arrangements. However, this shift may take time, and energy supply disruptions are likely, especially during peak summer months when demand surges. Meanwhile, the broader U.S. objective remains unchanged—curbing Iran’s nuclear capabilities, restricting its ballistic missile program, and severing its financial support to militant groups. U.S. officials estimate that, if it chose to pursue nuclear weapons, Iran could now develop one within mere weeks.The post Iran refuses talks under ‘intimidation’ as Trump ups pressure first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/iran-refuses-talks-intimidation-trump-pressure/	2025-03-10T06:13:05-07:00	
Breaking: Thousands of Syrians flee to Lebanon after coastal mass...	A surge of refugees has crossed into Lebanon as thousands of Syrians escape violent clashes and mass killings in the country’s coastal region. The recent unrest, which has left around 1,000 people dead—many of them civilians—has forced large numbers of people to flee, with most crossing the border through unofficial routes. Local authorities report that approximately 6,078 Syrians have arrived in northern Lebanon’s Akkar province, seeking safety in a dozen villages. The United Nations refugee agency has acknowledged these figures while also working to verify the number of arrivals in other areas. Lebanon, which already hosts more than 755,000 registered Syrian refugees, is struggling to accommodate the influx. In addition to the registered population, hundreds of thousands more Syrians are believed to be living in the country without official documentation. Despite the ongoing refugee crisis, the trend of Syrians returning home had recently begun to accelerate. Since November, nearly 260,000 Syrians have returned from exile, with Lebanon accounting for almost half of those repatriations. However, the latest wave of violence has reversed this trend, prompting fresh displacement. Syrian Interim Government Declares End to Military Operation The Syrian interim government has announced the conclusion of a large-scale military operation against insurgent groups loyal to former president Bashar al-Assad and his family. This offensive, described as the worst outbreak of violence since the civil war officially ended in December, lasted several days and caused widespread devastation. The conflict ignited last Thursday after an unexpected assault by gunmen from the Alawite community on a police patrol near the port city of Lattakia. The attack rapidly escalated, triggering intense clashes throughout Syria’s coastal region. Monitoring groups report that hundreds of civilians were among those killed during the fighting. Syria’s new Islamist-led government continues to struggle with maintaining control across the country and negotiating political agreements with minority groups. Key challenges remain in stabilizing relations with Kurdish factions in the northeast and the Druze community in the south. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, the recent clashes have resulted in at least 1,130 deaths, including 830 civilians. The humanitarian situation remains dire as Syria’s leadership attempts to establish order in the aftermath of the latest surge in violence.The post Breaking: Thousands of Syrians flee to Lebanon after coastal massacres first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/thousands-syrians-flee-lebanon-massacres/	2025-03-10T06:12:49-07:00	
Army calms tensions in Tripoli after reported stabbing of Syrian	In Tripoli, reports emerged of a Syrian minor being stabbed by a resident of Jabal Mohsen, leading to heightened tensions and gunfire in the city overnight. The National News Agency later clarified that the victim was a Bedouin individual. The incident prompted heavy deployment of army units, particularly in the al-Qobbeh and Jabal Mohsen areas, as well as along Syria Street, which separates Bab al-Tabbaneh and Jabal Mohsen. The military's intervention was successful in restoring calm to these neighborhoods. In response to the unrest, the Islamic Alawite Council emphasized that civil peace and security stability are paramount. They coordinated with security agencies to ensure the surrender of Ahmad al-Bitar, the individual involved in the stabbing incident, expressing confidence in the authorities' ability to transparently investigate the circumstances. The Council highlighted Tripoli's longstanding tradition of national cohesion and its resilience against strife, expressing hope for the city's continued safety and stability. Simultaneously, Syria's coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartus have experienced severe sectarian violence. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that over 1,000 people were killed in two days of clashes between security forces and fighters loyal to the former Assad regime, marking one of the highest death tolls since 2011. Among the dead were 745 civilians, executed during the fighting and reprisal attacks. The unrest began with an attack by pro-Assad fighters in Latakia. The violence highlights the ongoing challenges for Syria's new Islamist authorities, three months after overthrowing President Bashar al-Assad. With militias still active, government forces' actions led to significant civilian casualties, sparking fear among minority Alawites. The UN and France called for civilian protection and independent investigations, emphasizing the need for inclusive governance to prevent further violence.The post Army calms tensions in Tripoli after reported stabbing of Syrian first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/army-calms-tensions-tripoli-stabbing-syrian/	2025-03-09T06:13:41-07:00	
311 Alawite civilians massacred by Syrian forces and allies	The conflict in Syria has intensified, with security forces and their allies launching a major crackdown in the coastal region. Recent clashes have led to the deaths of hundreds of Alawite civilians, as the new authorities battle militants loyal to the former government of Bashar al-Assad. The situation remains highly volatile as fighting spreads across key strategic areas. Following the ousting of Assad’s government in a swift offensive, the newly installed authorities have struggled to maintain control. Security forces are now facing fierce resistance from members of the Alawite community, a sect closely associated with the former regime. In response, a large-scale counter-operation has been launched in the Mediterranean coastal region, a historical stronghold of Assad’s support base. Reports indicate that many civilians have been executed by security personnel or pro-government fighters, with incidents of looting further exacerbating tensions. The growing civilian death toll adds to the mounting instability, with the total number of casualties continuing to rise, including both security forces and pro-Assad fighters. Amid the unrest, remnants of the former regime have attempted to seize control of strategic locations, including an attack on a national hospital in the coastal city of Latakia. However, government forces have moved quickly to repel such offensives, intensifying operations to secure key regions. In a recent address, Syria’s interim president called on insurgents to surrender, warning that continued resistance would lead to further bloodshed. Meanwhile, the international community has stressed the need for unity in Syria, as efforts to rebuild the war-torn nation depend on establishing long-term stability. Reports of Mass Executions and Widespread Violence Human rights organizations have documented multiple massacres in recent days, with women and children among the victims. Footage has emerged showing harrowing scenes of bodies piled outside homes, bloodstains marking the ground, and civilians pleading for help. Other videos depict men in military uniforms executing people at close range, highlighting the brutality of the ongoing conflict. With the violence escalating and uncertainty looming over Syria’s future, concerns are mounting over the possibility of further sectarian strife. As the situation unfolds, the fate of thousands hangs in the balance, with no clear resolution in sight.The post 311 Alawite civilians massacred by Syrian forces and allies first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/311-alawite-civilians-massacred-syrian-forces-allies/	2025-03-09T06:13:31-07:00

Yemen rebels threaten to resume sea attacks if Gaza aid delayed	The Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have issued a warning that they will restart their attacks on Israeli-linked vessels unless humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza resume within four days. The group's leader, Abdulmalik al-Houthi, made the statement during a televised address, emphasizing that any continued blockade of aid would lead to the resumption of naval operations against Israeli shipping. During the Gaza conflict, the Houthis launched multiple drone and missile attacks on Israeli-affiliated and other commercial ships passing through the Red Sea. These strikes disrupted global shipping routes and escalated regional tensions. However, the group temporarily halted its operations following the January ceasefire. Escalating Tensions Amid U.S. Sanctions The warning from the Houthis follows Israel's recent announcement that it would block further aid deliveries to Gaza until Hamas agrees to the conditions set for extending the ceasefire. This decision has drawn criticism and raised concerns about worsening humanitarian conditions in the region. The latest threat from the Houthis also comes just days after the United States re-designated the group as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) and imposed sanctions on seven of its senior leaders. The designation reflects growing international concern over the group's role in destabilizing the region and disrupting global trade. As tensions mount, the coming days will be critical in determining whether diplomatic efforts can prevent further escalation or whether Red Sea shipping routes will once again become a target in the ongoing geopolitical struggle.The post Yemen rebels threaten to resume sea attacks if Gaza aid delayed first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/yemen-rebels-resume-attacks-gaza-aid-delayed/	2025-03-08T10:56:18-08:00	
World Bank says Lebanon needs $11bn for post-war rebuild	Lebanon’s recovery and reconstruction needs have been estimated at approximately $11 billion following the intense conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, which ended with a ceasefire in late November. According to assessments covering the period from October 8 to December 20, 2024, the war caused extensive physical destruction and severe economic losses, pushing Lebanon’s already fragile economy further into crisis. The overall economic toll of the conflict is estimated at around $14 billion. Of this total, approximately $6.8 billion accounts for damage to physical infrastructure, while the remaining $7.2 billion reflects lost productivity, reduced revenues, and higher operating costs for businesses and essential services. Housing and Tourism Sectors Among Worst Hit The housing sector bore the brunt of the physical devastation, with losses estimated at $4.6 billion. Thousands of homes, particularly in southern Lebanon and parts of Beirut’s southern suburbs, were either completely destroyed or left uninhabitable. The tourism sector, which was already struggling due to Lebanon’s prolonged financial collapse, suffered an estimated $3.6 billion in losses as conflict and instability wiped out any remaining hope for recovery in that industry. The conflict’s broader economic impact has been severe, with Lebanon’s real GDP shrinking by approximately 7.1 percent in 2024. This sharp contraction was a devastating reversal from what would have been modest economic growth of 0.9 percent had the conflict not occurred. By the end of 2024, Lebanon’s cumulative economic decline since 2019 neared 40 percent, highlighting how the war has compounded an already dire economic crisis caused by years of political paralysis, financial collapse, and declining investor confidence. The war, which lasted more than a year and included two months of full-scale hostilities, caused widespread destruction across Hezbollah strongholds in southern Lebanon and parts of the Bekaa Valley, as well as in southern areas of Beirut. The fighting inflicted major damage to infrastructure, residential areas, and commercial centers, deepening Lebanon’s already severe humanitarian and economic crises. Even before the outbreak of war, Lebanon was struggling with a prolonged economic meltdown, banking collapse, and near-total erosion of public services. However, the weakening of Hezbollah during the conflict contributed to breaking the political deadlock, ultimately leading to the long-delayed appointment of a new president and government after more than two years without a functioning executive.The post World Bank says Lebanon needs $11bn for post-war rebuild first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/world-bank-lebanon-11bn-post-war-rebuild/	2025-03-07T07:42:05-08:00	
Syria security forces execute 52 Alawites in Latakia	A Syrian war monitor has reported that security forces carried out the execution of 52 Alawite men in Latakia province, an area historically known as a stronghold for the Alawite community, to which the Assad family belongs. The executions occurred in the towns of Al-Shir and Al-Mukhtariya, according to a monitoring group that says it verified the information through video footage and testimonies gathered from relatives of those killed. The executions follow intense clashes that erupted on Thursday between security forces and armed groups loyal to former president Bashar al-Assad. The fighting broke out in Latakia, the spiritual and political center of the Alawite minority, an offshoot sect of Shia Islam closely tied to the Assad regime. Footage released by activists and the monitoring group depicted the aftermath, showing dozens of lifeless bodies in civilian clothing lying in a courtyard, with blood visible on the ground and grieving women crying nearby. Another video clip showed armed men in military uniforms forcing three individuals to crawl on the ground before executing them at point-blank range. Rising Death Toll in Post-Assad Crackdown The executions and battles in Latakia are part of a wider crackdown by Syria’s new authorities, who have been aggressively pursuing remnants of the Assad regime since Islamist-led rebels ousted Bashar al-Assad from power on December 8. The new leadership has particularly focused on dismantling pockets of Alawite resistance in the central and western parts of the country, where many of Assad’s loyalists remain. In addition to the 52 reported executions, the clashes over the past 24 hours have resulted in at least 72 more deaths, including 36 security personnel, 32 pro-Assad gunmen, and four civilians. These additional fatalities bring the total death toll in Latakia since Thursday to at least 124, according to the monitoring group. The situation in Latakia highlights the complex sectarian and political tensions that persist even after the fall of Assad, with the Alawite community—long associated with his rule—now facing violent reprisals as Syria’s new rulers seek to consolidate power and eliminate any perceived threats from Assad loyalists.The post Syria security forces execute 52 Alawites in Latakia first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/syria-forces-execute-52-alawites-latakia/	2025-03-07T07:41:58-08:00
