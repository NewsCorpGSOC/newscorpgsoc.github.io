Biden to Discuss Israel’s Iran Strike with Netanyahu	U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to have an important phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday morning regarding Israel's planned strikes on Iran, as reported by three U.S. officials to Axios. This call would be their first conversation in two months of tension and comes as Israel considers significant military action that could escalate the conflict in the region. On Tuesday night, Netanyahu met for several hours with senior ministers and heads of Israel's military and intelligence agencies to decide on the timing and scale of Israel's planned response, according to two Israeli officials. The retaliation is expected to be significant, potentially involving airstrikes on military sites in Iran and covert operations, like the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Israel is also considering targeting Iran's oil infrastructure, a move Biden has signaled he would oppose. An aide to Netanyahu informed Axios that, once a decision is made, Netanyahu would want to brief Biden. A U.S. official stated that Washington aims to 'use the call to try and shape the limitations of the Israeli retaliation.' The U.S. wants Israel to target significant sites without excessive force. The Biden-Netanyahu call is expected one week after Iran launched approximately 180 ballistic missiles at Israel. While most were intercepted, some caused minor damage to Israeli air bases, and a few landed near Mossad headquarters in Tel Aviv without causing any damage. The Iranian attack was in response to Israeli assassinations of key Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iranian officials. Tehran claimed it would not escalate further unless Israel attacked Iran again, while Israel vowed retaliation. U.S. and Israeli officials believe this cycle of retaliation will continue, with both countries coordinating closely to counter Iranian responses. Last Friday, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told Israel's Minister for Strategic Affairs, Ron Dermer, that the U.S. expects 'clarity and transparency' from Israel about its plans, given their implications for U.S. forces and interests in the region. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant was planning to travel to Washington on Tuesday, but the trip was blocked by Netanyahu, who insisted Gallant wait until Biden's call and approval from Israel's security cabinet for the attack plans. The upcoming call between Biden and Netanyahu was already arranged before the disagreement between Netanyahu and Gallant. According to U.S. officials, Biden and Netanyahu are also expected to discuss the ongoing conflicts in Lebanon and Gaza.The post Biden to Discuss Israel’s Iran Strike with Netanyahu first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/biden-discuss-israels-iran-strike-netanyahu/	2024-10-09T06:06:59-07:00	
Iran FM Heads to Saudi for Talks on Gaza and Lebanon	Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi will travel to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday for discussions about stopping Israeli attacks on Gaza and Lebanon, according to Iran's foreign ministry. Hamas and Hezbollah are both part of the Iran-backed 'Axis of Resistance' of militant groups in the region. Araghchi's visit to the Gulf kingdom is part of Iran's diplomatic efforts, coordinated with regional countries, ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei said on X (formerly Twitter). The visit aims to halt 'the Israeli regime's genocide and aggression' and reduce the suffering of people in Gaza and Lebanon, Baghaei added. Relations between predominantly Shia Iran and Sunni-majority Saudi Arabia were restored in March 2023 after a China-brokered deal ended a seven-year diplomatic rift. Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter and custodian of Islam's two holiest sites, suspended U.S.-led negotiations on normalizing relations with Israel after the onset of the Gaza conflict. Iran has repeatedly accused Israel, its longstanding rival, of committing genocide and war crimes since the beginning of the Gaza conflict. During a visit to Beirut on Friday, after the conflict spread to Lebanon, Araghchi expressed Iran's support for a 'simultaneous' ceasefire in Lebanon and the Palestinian territories. Iran also described Hamas's October 7, 2023, attack on Israel as 'a turning point in the history of the legitimate struggle of the Palestinian people against Israel.'The post Iran FM Heads to Saudi for Talks on Gaza and Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/iran-fm-heads-saudi-talks-gaza-lebanon/	2024-10-09T06:06:52-07:00	
Report: US Pushes for Comprehensive Peace in the Region	The United States is reportedly pursuing a 'comprehensive pacification' effort in the region, as revealed by Israel's Channel 12 in an unannounced move. These efforts are said to focus on achieving calm across all regional fronts, and, as of now, Israel is not actively involved in these discussions, according to the channel. Channel 12 cited senior Israeli officials who said they recently learned of talks between the United States, Arab countries, and Iran, involving a potential comprehensive ceasefire. This ceasefire would cover multiple conflicts, including the Israeli escalation in Lebanon and the support fronts launched by Houthi forces from Yemen and pro-Iran factions in Iraq. It remains unclear whether these efforts will also include the Gaza front. The report mentioned that 'Israel has not yet participated in these talks nor communicated its stance to the United States.' Senior Israeli officials were quoted as saying, 'Israel is currently in a position of strength,' and that any ceasefire would be on its terms, which would include the withdrawal of Hezbollah forces to north of the Litani River and the dismantling of all military facilities of the group in border areas. This news comes as Israel prepares to respond to the missile attack carried out by Iran on October 1, while reports indicate that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, after a long period of absence, is communicating with mediators to explore potential opportunities to restart negotiations.The post Report: US Pushes for Comprehensive Peace in the Region first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-pushes-comprehensive-peace-region/	2024-10-09T06:06:44-07:00	
Israeli Strike on Wardanieh Leaves at Least 4 Dead	The Lebanese Health Ministry reported that an Israeli airstrike on a hotel, which was being used as a shelter for displaced people in southern Lebanon, killed at least four individuals. The attack, which took place in Wardanieh in the Chouf district, north of Sidon, also left ten others injured. An Associated Press reporter in a nearby town heard two sonic booms and an explosion from Israeli aircraft before the strike, followed by black and white smoke billowing from the building.The post Israeli Strike on Wardanieh Leaves at Least 4 Dead first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strike-wardanieh-4-dead/	2024-10-09T06:06:35-07:00	
Spanish PM Urges Global Action Against Lebanon ‘Invasion’	Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Wednesday called Israel's military actions in Lebanon an 'invasion' and emphasized the need for international response.

Biden Marks Oct 7, Pledges Full Commitment to Israel’s Security	On the first anniversary of the Hamas attacks, President Joe Biden reaffirmed the United States' unwavering commitment to Israel's security and the right of Israel to defend itself against adversaries such as Hamas and Iran. 'Vice President (Kamala) Harris and I remain fully committed to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist,' Biden declared in a statement. He also reflected on the impact of the attacks on both Israelis and Palestinians, labeling the onset of the conflict as a tragic day for Palestinians as well. 'Far too many civilians have endured too much suffering over this year of conflict,' he added.The post Biden Marks Oct 7, Pledges Full Commitment to Israel’s Security first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/biden-oct-7-full-commitment-israels-security/	2024-10-08T06:38:39-07:00	
Turkey to Evacuate Citizens from Lebanon on Wednesday	Turkey is organizing a maritime evacuation of approximately 2,000 of its nationals from Lebanon, according to the foreign ministry.

UN Coordinator, UNIFIL Chief Push for Negotiated Solution	U.N. Special Coordinator for Lebanon Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert and UNIFIL Head of Mission and Force Commander Lt. Gen. Aroldo Lázaro have advocated for a 'negotiated solution' to resolve the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. Reflecting on the year since the conflict's escalation, they noted, 'It's been a year since the daily exchanges of fire began across the Blue Line, starting with Hezbollah firing rockets into Shebaa Farms, in breach of the cessation of hostilities and Security Council resolution 1701 from 2006. This year has seen a tremendous loss of life, massive displacement, and severe devastation, leaving civilians on both sides in desperate need of security and stability.' They expressed disappointment that their continuous calls for restraint, protection of civilians, adherence to international humanitarian law, and the resumption of political processes as per resolution 1701 have been ignored. 'One year on, what began as near-daily exchanges of fire has intensified into a relentless military offensive, creating a humanitarian disaster of immense scale. With ongoing Israeli bombardments now a daily reality in Lebanon, and Hezbollah's continued rocket and missile attacks on Israel, the human cost is unspeakable, with countless killed or injured and hundreds of thousands displaced,' they stated. Plasschaert and Lázaro highlighted that every act of aggression only serves to further distance the parties from the peace envisioned in resolution 1701 and the conditions necessary for lasting civilian security on both sides of the Blue Line. They concluded by emphasizing that continued violence and destruction would not address the root issues or enhance safety in the long term. Instead, they stressed that negotiating a solution is the only way to achieve the security and stability that civilians from both sides urgently need and deserve, urging immediate action towards this end.The post UN Coordinator, UNIFIL Chief Push for Negotiated Solution first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/un-coordinator-unifil-push-negotiated-solution/	2024-10-08T06:35:39-07:00	
Breaking: Israeli Army Launches Operations Against Hezbollah in S...	On Tuesday, the Israeli military announced it had initiated precise strikes against Hezbollah targets in southwest Lebanon, further intensifying its ground operations along Lebanon's coastline after increasing troop deployment. According to an official statement on its Telegram channel, 'Yesterday (Monday), the 146th Division began limited, localized, targeted operational activities against Hezbollah terror targets and infrastructure in southwestern Lebanon.' This military action follows warnings issued by the Israeli military to the residents of over a dozen towns and villages in southwestern Lebanon to evacuate, including Naqoura, which houses U.N. peacekeepers. On Monday night, the Israeli army designated four areas in northwest Israel as 'closed military zones' following the advisory for evacuations along the nearby Lebanese coast. The areas identified were Rosh HaNikra, Shlomi, Hanita, and Arab al-Aramshe in northern Israel, with entry to these areas prohibited starting at 22:00 that day. Israel has urged evacuations from several dozen communities in southern Lebanon, most of which are north of the U.N.-declared buffer zone set up following the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. The objective of these Israeli operations is to stop a year-long barrage of Hezbollah rocket fire, allowing thousands of its northern residents to safely return home. Meanwhile, Hezbollah has declared it will continue its attacks until a ceasefire is achieved in Gaza. The conflict, which intensified in mid-September, has resulted in the displacement of over 1 million Lebanese.The post Breaking: Israeli Army Launches Operations Against Hezbollah in Southwest Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-army-operations-hezbollah-lebanon/	2024-10-08T06:35:01-07:00	
US Urges Israel to Spare Beirut Airport	The United States has cautioned Israel against targeting Beirut airport and the access roads leading to it amid ongoing intensive airstrikes in Beirut’s southern suburbs. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller emphasized the importance of keeping these routes open not only for Americans seeking to leave Lebanon but also for international citizens. On Monday, Israeli forces launched an airstrike near Beirut’s international airport, as reported by a security source to AFP. This comes during a time when the U.S. has been organizing near-daily charter flights to evacuate American citizens and their families due to the escalating conflict with the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah. According to Miller, around 900 people have utilized these flights, though none have reached full capacity yet. Additionally, the U.S. is reserving seats on still-operating commercial flights for those wishing to leave. Approximately 8,500 Americans have reached out to the State Department regarding departure options, although this number doesn't necessarily reflect those intending to leave. Miller chose not to comment on whether the Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon, specifically Beirut, adhere to international law, stating, 'I don’t have a characterization of them one way or the other,' but he noted that the expectation is for operations to target Hezbollah in compliance with international humanitarian law, aiming to minimize civilian casualties. The U.S. has occasionally criticized Israel for the high civilian death toll in Gaza, where over 41,000 fatalities have been reported over the past year, with President Joe Biden describing some of Israel’s actions as 'over the top.' However, the U.S. continues to support Israel’s broader military efforts. Israel’s recent military actions were triggered by a deadly attack from the Palestinian militant group Hamas on October 7, 2023, and have since extended from Gaza, where Hamas is based, to targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon. While the U.S. backs Israel’s offensive against Hezbollah, Miller expressed concerns about the potential for these operations to extend indefinitely, stating, 'We are very cognizant of the many times in the past where Israel has gone in on what looked like limited operations and has stayed for months or for years. And ultimately, that’s not the outcome that we want to see.'The post US Urges Israel to Spare Beirut Airport first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-urges-israel-spare-beirut-airport/	2024-10-08T05:47:19-07:00	
Hezbollah Vows to Spare Israeli Troops Near Peacekeepers	Hezbollah has instructed its fighters to refrain from attacking Israeli forces who have positioned themselves behind a U.N. peacekeeping base near the Lebanese border village of Maroun al-Ras. This directive was issued following a statement from UNIFIL, the U.N. peacekeeping operation, which labeled Israel’s nearby military activities as 'extremely dangerous' and a threat to their peacekeepers’ safety. UNIFIL had also noted that it had repeatedly communicated its concerns to Israel. The decision by Hezbollah was intended to protect the lives of U.N. peacekeepers, according to a statement from one of its field commanders. Hezbollah has accused Israel of using the U.N. forces as human shields in these operations. Despite suggestions from Israel that UNIFIL should relocate, the peacekeeping body confirmed on Saturday that it would maintain its positions along the border. Meanwhile, Israel has recently announced its intention to conduct limited ground operations into southern Lebanon. Over the past week, there have been several clashes and attempted infiltrations by Israeli troops near Maroun al-Ras, as reported by Hezbollah. Since September 23, Israel has escalated its military actions in Lebanon, resulting in over 1,110 deaths and displacing hundreds of thousands. These developments come amidst an already severe economic crisis in Lebanon. The deployment of the Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeepers in southern Lebanon was a key provision of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which was aimed at ending the 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.The post Hezbollah Vows to Spare Israeli Troops Near Peacekeepers first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-spare-israeli-troops-peacekeepers/	2024-10-08T05:46:53-07:00	
Qassem Backs Berri’s Ceasefire, Assures Hezbollah’s Strength	On Tuesday, Hezbollah's Deputy Chief Sheikh Naim Qassem declared that the group's military strength remains robust despite enduring weeks of intense Israeli airstrikes. During a televised speech, Qassem emphasized Hezbollah's resilience and operational successes, noting, 'Hundreds of rockets and dozens of drones have been launched, targeting numerous Israeli settlements and cities&#8230; I assure you that our capabilities are intact.' Qassem's statement came on the anniversary of intensified hostilities that escalated into a full-blown conflict last month. He confidently asserted that Hezbollah would continue to extend its rocket fire deeper into Israeli territory, resulting in further displacement of Israelis. He further highlighted that Hezbollah has effectively filled positions left by commanders who were casualties of recent Israeli airstrikes, stating, 'There are no vacant posts.' He mentioned that the organization would appoint a new leader to follow Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed last month in a strike on an underground base in south Beirut, though he acknowledged the challenges posed by the ongoing war. 'The organization and its leadership remain tightly structured&#8230; We have weathered severe setbacks,' Qassem remarked, reflecting on the losses sustained, including that of Nasrallah and other key figures since September 23. In his address, Qassem mourned the late secretary-general but expressed motivation from Nasrallah's resilience. Addressing the Israeli army chief directly, he predicted failure for the Israeli forces: 'The longer the war drags on, the greater Israel's predicament will become.' 'We are steadfast and, God willing, we will triumph&#8230; We will not plead for peace nor will we be the first to falter,' he continued, expressing confidence in defeating Israel and critiquing the Israeli military's inability to make significant ground advances in southern Lebanon. He described any territorial gains by Israel as inconsequential and expressed a readiness to engage the enemy, suggesting that Israeli losses could potentially hasten the end of the conflict. Furthermore, Qassem expressed support for political efforts aimed at achieving a ceasefire with Israel, led by Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, whom he referred to as the 'big brother' and in whom he places complete trust. Al-Arabiya television reported that Lebanese politicians interpret Qassem's remarks as effectively passing leadership responsibilities to Nabih Berri during these critical times.The post Qassem Backs Berri’s Ceasefire, Assures Hezbollah’s Strength first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/qassem-backs-berris-ceasefire-assures-hezbollahs-strength/	2024-10-08T05:46:29-07:00	
Hezbollah Launches 85 Rockets Over Haifa, Israel Hits Dahieh	On Tuesday, the Israeli military reported that around 85 projectiles were launched from Lebanon towards northern Israel, impacting areas including the Upper Galilee, Central Galilee, and Haifa Bay, coinciding with a televised address by Hezbollah's deputy chief, Naim Qassem. During this attack, a 70-year-old woman suffered moderate injuries from shrapnel, and Israeli media showcased footage showing light damage to structures in the vicinity of Haifa, a major coastal city. Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the barrage, describing it as a 'large rocket salvo' directed at Haifa and its northern suburbs. The group stated that the attack was a retaliatory measure against Israeli assaults on urban areas and civilians in Lebanon. In a related event, Israel conducted a severe airstrike on Haret Hreik, a southern suburb of Beirut.The post Hezbollah Launches 85 Rockets Over Haifa, Israel Hits Dahieh first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-launches-85-rockets-haifa/	2024-10-08T05:46:13-07:00	
US Trust in Israeli Govt. Fades as Official Denies Seeking War wi...	Recent weeks have seen the Biden administration grow 'increasingly distrustful' of the Israeli government's statements about its military and diplomatic strategies amid ongoing conflicts, according to reports from Axios based on information from four U.S. officials. The trust issues have been exacerbated by Israel's planned retaliation against Iran for a significant missile attack, necessitating coordination with the U.S. given potential ramifications for American forces and interests. While the U.S. is not opposed to Israel responding, it expects any actions to be proportionate. During a recent discussion, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan emphasized to Israel's minister for strategic affairs, Ron Dermer, the U.S.'s expectation for 'clarity and transparency' regarding Israel's retaliation plans. Sullivan conveyed that without clear communication, the U.S. might not automatically support Israel against further Iranian attacks, although U.S. officials acknowledge that America would likely aid Israel's defense if needed. The level of communication has been a point of contention, with the U.S. often caught off guard by Israeli military or intelligence actions. Examples include unnoted Israeli airstrikes in the Middle East and significant operations like the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, which occurred without prior U.S. knowledge. These actions followed assurances from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to President Joe Biden about progressing towards a ceasefire and hostage release with Hamas. Further strains were evident when U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin learned of the assassination of Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah just minutes before Israeli jets bombed targets in Beirut, viewing it as a breach of trust. Despite these tensions, discussions between the U.S. and Israel continue. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, speaking with Austin, mentioned that Israel had not yet finalized its plans for striking back at Iran. Gallant is scheduled to meet with U.S. officials in Washington to discuss the matter further. An Israeli official noted that while Israel recognizes U.S. concerns and welcomes their input, it will respond to the Iranian attack decisively, ensuring that its actions do not escalate into a broader conflict with Iran.The post US Trust in Israeli Govt.

Macron Urges Netanyahu: The Time for a Ceasefire Is Now	On the eve of the anniversary marking last year's Hamas attacks against Israel, French President Emmanuel Macron had a phone conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. During this call, Macron emphasized France's steadfast support for Israel's security and advocated for a ceasefire in the ongoing conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon, according to the French presidency. The discussion occurred amid tense relations, following Macron's recent public statements advocating for a halt to the provision of arms used in the Gaza conflict, stressing the need for a political resolution. Although Macron clarified that France was not supplying weapons itself, his comments had sparked a pointed response from Netanyahu the day prior. During their conversation, Macron and Netanyahu candidly addressed the current Middle Eastern conflicts, acknowledging their differing views but expressing a mutual desire for understanding. The French president reassured Netanyahu of France's dedication to Israel's security, mentioning the deployment of French military resources in response to recent Iranian attacks. The call highlighted ongoing tensions and the complex geopolitical landscape, with Israel actively engaged in military operations against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, and facing threats from Iran.The post Macron Urges Netanyahu: The Time for a Ceasefire Is Now first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/macron-netanyahu-time-ceasefire-now/	2024-10-07T03:26:33-07:00	
Hezbollah Bombs Israeli Troops in Maroun al-Ras as Israel Deploys...	Hezbollah launched an attack against Israeli troops in a southern Lebanese village on Monday, while the Israeli military has increased its presence in the region by deploying an additional division for operations in Lebanon. According to Hezbollah, they struck Israeli forces gathered in Maroun al-Ras park with a barrage of rockets. This followed their earlier strikes across northern Israel and other military locations along the border. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed the deployment of the 91st Division to southern Lebanon, marking the third division to engage in the ground offensive against Hezbollah. Continued Conflict on Anniversary Hezbollah also reaffirmed its commitment to continue fighting against what it calls Israeli 'aggression,' especially significant on the anniversary of the Hamas attack on October 7, which sparked the current conflict in Gaza. Despite the heavy toll on Lebanon, Hezbollah expressed steadfastness in its resistance against Israeli forces, labeling Israel as a malignancy that must be eradicated. Casualty Reports The IDF reported the death of a soldier on Lebanon’s northern frontier, underscoring the ongoing danger since the initiation of ground operations against Hezbollah last week. Master Sergeant Etay Azulay was identified as the soldier who was killed during combat. Concerns for UN Peacekeepers Tensions have also escalated near the U.N. peacekeeping bases, as the Israeli military begins establishing a forward operating base close to these locations, potentially endangering peacekeepers. Despite requests from the Israeli military, UNIFIL, tasked with overseeing Israeli withdrawal since the 1978 invasion, has refused to abandon some of its positions in anticipation of the Israeli ground incursion.The post Hezbollah Bombs Israeli Troops in Maroun al-Ras as Israel Deploys Third Division first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-bombs-israeli-troops-maroun-al-ras/	2024-10-07T03:26:20-07:00	
Hezbollah Strikes Base Near Haifa After Another Intense Night	Early on Monday, Hezbollah announced that it had attacked an Israeli military installation near Haifa, marking the third such assault on military positions in that area within a single day. According to a statement from the group, Hezbollah militants fired Fadi 1 rockets at the Carmel base south of Haifa late Sunday. This followed two previous strikes on another military site also located south of Haifa, which the group dedicated to their late leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed last month in an Israeli strike on Beirut's southern suburbs. In response to ongoing threats, the Israeli military issued a renewed call on Sunday night for civilians to evacuate parts of Beirut's southern suburbs, a Hezbollah stronghold that has been under intense bombardment since last month. Military spokesman Avichay Adraee delivered the evacuation warning via social media platform X, specifying the areas of Burj al-Barajneh and Hadath as imminent targets due to their proximity to Hezbollah facilities. Following the evacuation warnings, Beirut's southern skyline was again illuminated by airstrikes, intensifying after what was already the heaviest bombardment since the escalation of aerial attacks on September 23. An earlier airstrike on Sunday in the town of Qmatiyeh, southeast of Beirut, resulted in the deaths of six individuals, including three children, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. Over the weekend, more than 30 airstrikes were reported by Lebanon's state-run National News Agency, while Israeli forces noted that approximately 130 projectiles had been fired from Lebanon into Israeli territory. Residents of Beirut described the overwhelming and terrifying sounds of the conflict, with one labeling it 'a night of terror.' In a particularly tragic incident, an airstrike in the coastal village of Jiyyeh killed three sisters and their aunt. A neighbor stressed the civilian nature of the targeted home by pointing out the victims were all women. The recent surge in violence follows Israel's initiation of a limited ground operation in southern Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah following the killing of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and several senior leaders. This conflict represents the most severe fighting between Israel and Hezbollah since their month-long war in 2006. The ongoing hostilities have resulted in the deaths of at least 1,400 Lebanese, including civilians and Hezbollah combatants, and have displaced over 1.2 million people. Israel maintains that its objective is to eliminate Hezbollah's presence near its borders to allow for the safe return of Israeli citizens.The post Hezbollah Strikes Base Near Haifa After Another Intense Night first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-strikes-base-haifa-intense-night/	2024-10-07T03:26:04-07:00

Israelis, Fighting on Multiple Fronts, Commemorate One Year Since...	Israelis commemorated the one-year anniversary of the devastating October 7, 2023, Hamas attack with vigils and solemn events on Monday. This attack, which occurred during a significant Jewish holiday, was the deadliest in Israel's history, initiating the ongoing conflict in Gaza and severely impacting the national psyche. The unexpected nature of the attack eroded the public's trust in their leadership and military, leaving a lasting impact that continues to influence the region today. The repercussions are still felt as Israel not only contends with the ongoing conflict in Gaza but also faces a new confrontation with Hezbollah and an intensifying struggle with Iran, a supporter of both Hamas and Hezbollah. On the anniversary, Hamas continued its resistance, launching rockets that triggered air raid sirens as far as Tel Aviv and near the Gaza border. In Gaza, the heavy toll of the conflict is ever-present, with no formal commemoration planned due to the extensive destruction and displacement caused by the Israeli counterattacks. Across Israel, people gathered at various memorials and cemeteries, while the Israeli Knesset lowered its flags to half-staff. An official state ceremony, which was pre-recorded in Ofakim to minimize disruption, focused on acts of bravery and hope. However, dissatisfaction with the government's handling of the attack and ongoing frustration over unreturned hostages led to a separate gathering in Tel Aviv by the families of victims. The size of this event was significantly reduced due to restrictions on large assemblies, a consequence of the ongoing missile threats from Iran and Hezbollah. The grim reality persists for the many hostages still held, with continuous upheaval in border communities and widespread displacement. The conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon are ongoing, with Israeli actions under scrutiny from international courts and relentless global criticism. The war has inflicted severe casualties, displacing a large portion of Gaza's 2.3 million residents, exacerbating a humanitarian crisis marked by extensive hunger and leaving the region heavily damaged despite repeated attempts at negotiating ceasefires led by the U.S.The post Israelis, Fighting on Multiple Fronts, Commemorate One Year Since Oct. 7 first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israelis-multiple-fronts-commemorate-year-oct-7/	2024-10-07T03:25:23-07:00	
Thousands Rally Globally for Ceasefire Ahead of Gaza War Annivers...	On the eve of the first anniversary of the conflict between Israel and Hamas set for October 7, large-scale protests erupted globally over the weekend. Demonstrators in various cities worldwide called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon amid ongoing hostilities involving Israel, Hamas, Iran, and Hezbollah, the latter supported by Iran. According to data from Gaza's health ministry, validated as credible by the United Nations, Israel's counterattacks have resulted in over 41,000 deaths, predominantly among civilians. Israel has escalated its military activities, now including a ground invasion in Lebanon, in response to recent missile attacks from Iran, raising concerns about the conflict broadening into a larger war. Demonstrations were particularly notable in Washington, where over a thousand people rallied outside the White House, urging the U.S. government under President Joe Biden to halt military support and aid to Israel. A dramatic incident occurred during the protests when a man set his arm on fire, which was quickly extinguished by police and onlookers. Simultaneously, support for Palestine saw thousands rallying in cities across continents, including Europe, Africa, Australia, and the Americas, demanding an end to the hostilities in Gaza. Violence marked the protests in Rome, where clashes between young protesters and the police involved the hurling of bottles and firecrackers, prompting police retaliation with tear gas and water cannons. This confrontation resulted in injuries to a police officer and the detention of two protesters. In Berlin, authorities detained 26 individuals at a pro-Israeli event who were accused of hurling insults, with the event drawing around 650 attendees. London's 'National March for Palestine' was vocal with chants like 'stop bombing civilians' and 'hands off Lebanon,' reflecting the global outcry against the bombings. Lebanon’s Prime Minister Najib Mikati, amidst this turmoil, advocated for international pressure on Israel to cease fire, aligning with US and French efforts to negotiate a truce. His comments coincided with new Israeli airstrikes targeting Hezbollah in Beirut’s southern suburbs, which were followed by additional strikes later, intensifying the situation.The post Thousands Rally Globally for Ceasefire Ahead of Gaza War Anniversary first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/thousands-rally-ceasefire-gaza-war-anniversary/	2024-10-06T02:29:12-07:00

Speaking to France Inter on Saturday, Macron emphasized the need for a political solution and confirmed that France has not been providing weapons to Israel.

Israeli Military Official: 'Preparing Response' to Iranian Attack	An Israeli official reported to AFP that Israel's military is preparing a response to Iran's recent missile attack. The official, who remained unnamed due to restrictions on speaking publicly, did not specify what the response would entail. Haaretz, a left-leaning newspaper, has cited military sources saying that the response will be substantial. According to these sources, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) are planning a significant military strike against Iran, prompted by the missile barrage earlier in the week from Tehran. The paper also noted that further missile attacks from Iran might occur after Israel's retaliatory action. Iran had fired approximately 200 missiles towards Israel on October 1, marking its second direct assault in under six months. Israel's air defense systems intercepted most of these missiles, with only a few hitting military targets and causing minimal damage and no casualties. This missile launch by Iran was said to be in retaliation for the killing of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah by an Israeli airstrike in Beirut on September 27. Additionally, Iran linked this assault to the death of Ismail Haniyeh, a former leader of Hamas, who was killed in Tehran on July 31. Iran and Hamas have accused Israel of being behind Haniyeh's assassination, although Israel has not publicly acknowledged these claims.The post Israeli Military Official: 'Preparing Response' to Iranian Attack first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-military-official-preparing-response-iranian-attack/	2024-10-06T02:05:18-07:00	
Netanyahu Warns Israel Is Fighting on Seven Fronts	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that, almost a year following the Hamas attacks, Israel is currently engaged in conflicts across seven different fronts. In a recent video address, he outlined the various adversaries Israel is confronting, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, the Houthis in Yemen, militant groups in both the West Bank and the Shiite militias operating in Iraq and Syria, and Iran itself. Netanyahu highlighted Iran's recent action of launching over 200 ballistic missiles directly at Israel, accusing it of orchestrating the multi-front offensive. Netanyahu emphasized Israel's ongoing efforts to alter the strategic dynamics in the north with Lebanon, noting that Israel has conducted close to 9,000 strikes there since October 8, in response to around 1,500 attacks from Hezbollah, according to data from ACLED. He also defended Israel's actions in Gaza, citing the right to self-defense, and reaffirmed the nation's commitment to rescuing 101 hostages. He criticized French President Emmanuel Macron and other leaders who have called for arms embargoes against Israel, asserting that Israel will persist in its fight for national security and global peace. The conflict has been severe, with over 1,400 people killed by Israeli strikes in Lebanon in the past month and nearly 7,500 injured, as reported by Lebanon's health ministry.The post Netanyahu Warns Israel Is Fighting on Seven Fronts first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/netanyahu-warns-israel-fighting-seven-fronts/	2024-10-06T02:05:07-07:00	
Israeli Military Encircles Jabalya in Northern Gaza Amid Deadly S...	The Israeli military has reported that it has surrounded Jabalya in northern Gaza and is actively conducting operations in the region. In preparation for this ground operation, they executed several airstrikes targeting alleged weapons storage, underground facilities, terrorist cells, and military infrastructure in the area. According to a CNN journalist, these strikes focused mainly on eastern Jabalya and nearby Gaza City, lasting around 90 minutes. The Palestine Red Crescent Society reported that these strikes resulted in the deaths of two individuals and injured others, with one of the strikes impacting an apartment close to a UNRWA clinic in the Jabalya refugee camp. The Israeli military has stated its objective is to dismantle Hamas's infrastructure in the area due to detected activities aimed at restoring their operational capabilities. They have communicated their intention to continue these operations as necessary to meet their strategic goals. Back in May, CNN had covered the Israeli military's resumed operations in northern Gaza, following claims made in January that they had dismantled the command structure of Hamas there. Despite these efforts, there were indications that Hamas was attempting to regroup, casting doubt on the feasibility of Israel's aim to completely eliminate Hamas from Gaza. Recently, the Israeli military advised civilians in northern Gaza to evacuate, with a new evacuation map being published for the area. Avichay Adraee, the Arabic-speaking spokesperson for the Israeli military, mentioned the expansion of a 'humanitarian area' in Al-Mawasi that includes access routes, field hospitals established since the war began, and areas providing essential supplies like food, water, and medical resources. Journalists have reported that evacuations began late Saturday, with Palestinians moving towards Gaza City in response to the military warnings.The post Israeli Military Encircles Jabalya in Northern Gaza Amid Deadly Strikes first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-military-encircles-jabalya-northern-gaza/	2024-10-06T02:04:57-07:00	
Israeli Strike on Central Gaza Mosque Leaves 21 Dead, Death Toll ...	The number of casualties from an Israeli airstrike on a mosque in central Gaza has increased to 21, as reported by the local Civil Defense and a hospital situated close to the site. Video footage from CNN depicted the frantic efforts to extract bodies from the debris following the nocturnal strike on the mosque in Deir el Balah. Originally reported at 18, the death toll was later updated to 21 by sources from the Civil Defense and the Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, located directly opposite the mosque. In a desperate search for survivors amid the mosque's wreckage, civilians along with civil defense and hospital personnel scrambled in darkness, aided only by the light from their cellphones, as shown in the CNN video. The video captured distressing scenes where bodies lay strewn about, with rescuers calling out as they discovered each person. In one instance, a man is heard shouting, 'He’s alive, by God he’s alive,' as he attempts to aid a non-responsive victim on the ground. Rescue efforts included a group of men successfully extracting another man, barely alive, from beneath a heavy block, while another appeared to have been killed by the strike. Victims, visibly wounded and covered in dust, were hastily transported on blankets to the nearby hospital. The Israeli military acknowledged conducting the strike, describing it as 'precise' and aimed at a Hamas 'command and control' center that they claimed was located within the mosque complex.The post Israeli Strike on Central Gaza Mosque Leaves 21 Dead, Death Toll Rises first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strike-central-gaza-mosque-21-dead/	2024-10-06T02:04:48-07:00	
UAE Ships 40 Tons of Medical Aid to Lebanon	On Saturday, an aircraft from the United Arab Emirates carrying 40 tons of critical medical supplies landed in Lebanon, part of the UAE's campaign, 'UAE stands with Lebanon,' as confirmed by a Lebanese Ministry of Health official to CNN. The UAE's foreign ministry declared the start of its relief efforts to aid Lebanon on the same day. The ministry highlighted that this aid delivery underlines the UAE's dedication to humanitarian efforts and signifies the strong brotherly ties between the two nations, especially during challenging times. According to the UAE’s foreign ministry, this gesture is part of a broader commitment wherein the UAE will provide $100 million in aid to Lebanon. The ministry also expressed its concerns about the growing conflict in Lebanon and its potentially destabilizing effects on regional stability. This development follows the announcement by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday of nearly $157 million in U.S. humanitarian assistance intended to support those affected by the ongoing conflict in Lebanon and surrounding areas. Recent weeks have seen the displacement of up to one million individuals within Lebanon, triggered by intensified military actions by Israel against Hezbollah. This figure includes over 200,000 people, predominantly Lebanese and Syrians, who have sought refuge in Syria, as reported by the United Nations.The post UAE Ships 40 Tons of Medical Aid to Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/uae-ships-40-tons-medical-aid-lebanon/	2024-10-05T07:21:52-07:00	
Breaking: Hezbollah Loses Contact with Nasrallah’s Potential Succ...	Hezbollah is currently unable to establish contact with Hashem Safieddine, a key figure viewed as a potential successor to the recently deceased leader Hassan Nasrallah, a Lebanese security source reported to CNN. Safieddine has been unreachable following an Israeli airstrike in Beirut’s southern suburbs on Friday. Safieddine, who is Nasrallah's maternal cousin, was a prominent candidate for leadership, having previously headed Hezbollah’s executive council. Both he and Nasrallah studied together in Iran during the 1980s. In a statement last month, after attacks targeted Hezbollah's communication devices, Safieddine declared that his group would persist in its efforts 'until the end.' The United States has recognized Hezbollah as a foreign terrorist organization since 1997 and specifically designated Safieddine as a terrorist in 2017.The post Breaking: Hezbollah Loses Contact with Nasrallah’s Potential Successor first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-loses-contact-nasrallahs-potential-successor/	2024-10-05T07:21:44-07:00	
Breaking: Israel Kills Hamas Military Wing Leader in Lebanon Airs...	An Israeli airstrike near Tripoli, Lebanon's northernmost city, resulted in the death of a key figure from Hamas’ military faction. The Israel Defense Forces and the Shin Bet intelligence agency confirmed they targeted and killed Saeed Atallah Ali, a high-ranking Hamas operative in Lebanon. They accused him of conducting terrorist activities against Israeli interests and recruiting for Hamas within Lebanon. This incident marks a rare attack on Tripoli, a city that had not seen such military actions since the 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. Typically, Israeli strikes have concentrated on southern Lebanon and Hezbollah's bases around southern Beirut. Hamas acknowledged the loss of Atallah Ali, describing him as a prominent leader in their Al-Qassam Brigades' Lebanon operations. The attack, which Hamas labeled as a 'treacherous Zionist bombing,' also claimed the lives of Ali's wife and two daughters. It took place at their residence in the Beddawi refugee camp, situated on a hill roughly 5 kilometers northeast of Tripoli. Visuals from the site depicted significant damage to an apartment building, with debris around and sheets draped from a balcony, partially covering the destruction. This airstrike is part of the broader ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, which escalated from exchanges starting October 7, 2023. Additionally, Israel and Hezbollah have been engaged in consistent hostilities since the following day. Hezbollah has declared it will continue its operations against Israel until a ceasefire is reached in Gaza.The post Breaking: Israel Kills Hamas Military Wing Leader in Lebanon Airstrike first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-kills-hamas-military-wing-leader-airstrike/	2024-10-05T07:21:35-07:00	
Watch: Breaking: Israeli Military Vows 'Serious and Significant' ...	The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have announced they are preparing a robust response to the recent Iranian ballistic missile strike, which involved approximately 200 missiles, as reported by the Times of Israel last Saturday. The IDF has stated that this attack will not go unanswered and that it will have significant repercussions. In a detailed operation, the IDF's Commando Brigade and the elite Yaholam Unit took decisive action against Hezbollah by destroying several tunnel shafts that were reportedly being used by militants to approach the Israeli border from southern Lebanon. This operation also targeted underground weapon caches, observation points, and rocket launching pads located in southern Lebanese villages. In these intense military activities, the IDF claims to have eliminated dozens of Hezbollah militants through coordinated airstrikes and on-ground engagements. To date, the Israeli military asserts that it has killed over 400 Hezbollah operatives during its ground operations in the region. These operations are described by the IDF as precise and focused, aimed at significantly disrupting Hezbollah's infrastructure along the border. The main objective is to demolish strategic assets within villages close to Israel to ensure the safety of northern Israeli residents and facilitate their return. Additionally, the Israeli forces have concentrated their efforts on what they identify as Hezbollah's strategic strongholds in southern Lebanon, where they have discovered extensive weapon stockpiles. One notable action included an IDF drone strike on a Hezbollah command center located within a mosque at the Martyr Salah Ghandour Hospital compound in the town of Bint Jbeil, southern Lebanon. The IDF highlighted that this strike was executed with precision, based on reliable intelligence.The post Watch: Breaking: Israeli Military Vows 'Serious and Significant' Response to Iran’s Missile Attack first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-military-serious-significant-response-iran/	2024-10-05T05:16:30-07:00	
UN Reports Over 200,000 Flee Lebanon Into Syria	Over 200,000 individuals have crossed from Lebanon into Syria, fleeing the Israeli bombardments, according to Filippo Grandi, the United Nations' High Commissioner for Refugees. This number includes both Lebanese and Syrians who had been residing in Lebanon. Grandi highlighted that humanitarian efforts to aid these displaced persons are underway at border checkpoints, coordinated by the UN and organizations like the Syrian Red Crescent. In the broader scope of the crisis, Lebanese officials report that the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has displaced over 1.2 million people within Lebanon itself, forcing many to live in precarious conditions on the streets. Additionally, Giacomo Lapo Baldini, Lebanon’s country director for Relief International, recently shared with CNN that the destruction has severely impacted access to clean water, as Israeli strikes have damaged water facilities.The post UN Reports Over 200,000 Flee Lebanon Into Syria first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/over-200000-flee-lebanon-into-syria/	2024-10-05T05:15:32-07:00

Hezbollah Clashes with Troops at Border as Israeli Airstrikes Pou...	Hezbollah declared on Saturday that its militants were actively engaging Israeli forces in southern Lebanon, highlighting a severe escalation in the conflict. This announcement follows Israel's intensified bombing across Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah strongholds as ground operations intensify near the Lebanese border, marking a significant escalation from previous cross-border exchanges to outright warfare. The latest Israeli airstrikes targeted the northern Tripoli region, hitting the Beddawi refugee camp and killing a Hamas commander and his family. This event underscores the broadening scope of the conflict, which now includes direct strikes in regions previously untouched by the current spate of violence. In Beirut, displaced individuals like Ibrahim Nazzal lament the destruction and express a desire to return to their lands despite the devastation. The conflict has escalated following Iran's unprecedented missile attack on Israel, coupled with ongoing Hezbollah rocket attacks and regional support from Iran's allies. This week's events mark a critical juncture, coinciding with the first anniversary of the significant Hamas attack on Israel on October 7. The situation in Beirut is dire, with airstrikes causing significant damage and civilian casualties, including the recent killing of more than 1,000 people by Israeli actions since September 23. On the ground, Hezbollah has reported that its fighters clashed with Israeli troops after repelling an earlier advance, while Israel claims to have eliminated a substantial number of Hezbollah militants. The conflict has had a significant humanitarian impact, prompting widespread displacement and severe damage to infrastructure, including hospitals. Lebanon's emergency response capabilities are stretched thin, with several medical facilities knocked out of operation and a crucial aid shipment recently arriving in Beirut. This ongoing conflict has drawn international concern, with various global actors urging restraint and a move towards diplomatic resolutions. However, the situation remains volatile, with significant military actions continuing and no clear resolution in sight.The post Hezbollah Clashes with Troops at Border as Israeli Airstrikes Pound Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-clashes-border-israeli-airstrikes-lebanon/	2024-10-05T04:46:59-07:00	
US Delivers Humanitarian Aid to Lebanon	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that the United States will deliver almost $157 million in additional humanitarian aid to support communities affected by conflict in Lebanon and the surrounding region. Blinken detailed that this assistance would benefit internally displaced persons and refugees within Lebanon, as well as those escaping to neighboring Syria. He explained that the American people are providing this vital support, which includes approximately $82 million managed by the Department of State’s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration and another $75 million through the United States Agency for International Development’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance. USAID has already allocated $11.5 million and is coordinating with Congress to release an additional $63.5 million soon to ensure ongoing support to the most vulnerable groups. This aid, comprising emergency food supplies, shelter, blankets, hygiene products, as well as water and sanitation services, aims to provide essential relief to those facing severe hardships, Blinken remarked. Over the past year, the U.S. has contributed nearly $386 million to assist those in Lebanon and Syria affected by escalating conflicts. Blinken highlighted the dire humanitarian crisis in Lebanon, which has displaced over a million people, and reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to supporting the region's most vulnerable. He also called on other donors to increase their contributions to meet the growing humanitarian needs.The post US Delivers Humanitarian Aid to Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-delivers-humanitarian-aid-lebanon/	2024-10-05T04:46:47-07:00

Volunteers Brave Danger to Rescue Pets from Bombed-Out Dahieh	Following the intense Israeli bombardment in Lebanon, many residents were forced to flee their homes quickly, leaving behind their pets in the chaos. Maggie Shaarawi, vice president of Animals Lebanon, has stepped in to help these animals. Due to the stressful environment, many cats hide and are left behind as their owners escape the danger. Shaarawi, along with her team, recently entered a heavily damaged neighborhood in Beirut's southern suburbs to rescue eight cats for a distressed owner who guided them via video call to the location of her cats in her living room. The team successfully located and rescued all the cats, narrowly escaping further destruction in the area, which was subsequently hit by another airstrike. This close encounter with danger highlighted the perilous nature of their mission. The escalation of airstrikes by Israel since September 23 has had devastating effects, killing over 1,000 people and displacing more than a million, according to Lebanese sources. Despite the risks, many residents have managed to bring their pets with them as they evacuate, but others, too attached to leave their animals behind, have chosen to stay despite the dangers. Shaarawi mentioned that so far, her team has managed to save around 120 animals from the Beirut suburbs and an additional 60 from the south. Despite a dangerous encounter with an airstrike, they continued their rescue efforts the following day. The rescue missions are tense and urgent, with animals, especially cats, becoming extremely agitated and fearful, resembling tigers in their frightened state. The team uses mopeds to quickly enter and exit the bombarded areas. Shaarawi described the war as traumatizing for both the animals and their human companions, who are subjected to daily bombings without understanding what is happening around them. They simply wait for their owners' return. Unfortunately, not all rescue missions are successful. In one heartbreaking instance, the team discovered one cat deceased and could not locate two others, presumed dead under the rubble of a destroyed house. The ongoing conflict continues to pose severe risks to both human and animal lives in the region.The post Volunteers Brave Danger to Rescue Pets from Bombed-Out Dahieh first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/volunteers-danger-rescue-pets-dahieh/	2024-10-05T04:46:13-07:00	
Four Lebanese Hospitals Halt Services as Israeli Bombing Intensif...	In recent times, multiple hospitals in Lebanon have been compelled to cease operations due to the ongoing Israeli bombardment. The cease in operations includes four hospitals, notably after Hezbollah-affiliated emergency personnel reported 11 casualties from Israeli strikes in southern Lebanon. Amidst these escalations, Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati has called upon the global community to influence Israel to facilitate access for rescue and medical teams to the sites of bombardments. He highlighted the severe impact on emergency teams, noting the deaths of many emergency workers recently. One such affected facility, Sainte Therese Hospital in Beirut’s southern suburbs, experienced severe damage from nearby Israeli airstrikes, leading to a suspension of all hospital services. Similarly, Mays al-Jabal hospital, located at the Israel-Lebanon border, ceased operations due to direct targeting and logistical challenges affecting supplies and staff movements. In an alarming incident reported by Mouenes Kalakesh, the director of Marjayoun governmental hospital, Israeli airstrikes targeted ambulances at the hospital’s entrance, resulting in fatalities among paramedics and forcing the hospital's closure. The Islamic Health Committee also reported the deaths of several emergency workers in Marjayoun and other locations due to direct strikes. Further complicating the situation, the Israeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee accused Hezbollah of exploiting ambulances for military purposes, warning that such vehicles could be targeted if found transporting combatants or military gear. Additional strikes were reported on the Salah Ghandour hospital in Bint Jbeil, leading to casualties among the medical staff and the evacuation of the facility. This ongoing conflict, which has seen nearly daily exchanges of fire across the Lebanon-Israel border, has significantly escalated since September 23, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis with over 1,110 people killed and up to a million displaced, as per official figures.The post Four Lebanese Hospitals Halt Services as Israeli Bombing Intensifies first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/four-lebanese-hospitals-halt-services-israeli-bombing/	2024-10-05T04:46:05-07:00	
State Department: Duration of Israel’s Ground Incursions in Leban...	The U.S. has engaged in talks with Israel regarding the aftermath of its military operations in Lebanon, though the duration of these activities remains uncertain, the State Department disclosed. State Department spokesperson Matt Miller expressed uncertainty about the future developments. 'I'm not going to prejudge what's going to happen. We don’t know what’s going to happen. Dare I say, the Israelis probably don’t know what’s going to happen at this point,' Miller stated. He emphasized that the U.S. would continue to monitor the situation closely and assess it as it evolves. Miller declined to comment on whether Israel has a definitive strategy for ending the conflict in the north, which has seen increased incursions and strikes in Beirut targeting Hezbollah. 'The Israelis will have to speak to that question, not me,' he remarked. Despite the lack of clear information from U.S. officials regarding the specifics of Israel’s military strategy against Hezbollah, Miller affirmed strong U.S. support for Israel’s targeted actions against the militant group’s infrastructure. He highlighted the U.S. desire for a diplomatic solution while also supporting efforts to weaken Hezbollah’s military capabilities.The post State Department: Duration of Israel’s Ground Incursions in Lebanon Uncertain first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/duration-israels-ground-incursions-uncertain/	2024-10-03T23:52:36-07:00	
Israeli Military Reports 20 Projectiles Fired from Lebanon into I...	The Israeli military reported that after sirens alerted the northern regions of Haifa and Galilee, nearly two dozen projectiles were launched from Lebanon into Israel. A Reuters video captured the moment these rockets were intercepted by Israel's defense systems above Haifa early Friday morning. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) detailed that around 20 projectiles were detected following the sirens, which went off between 7:01 a.m. and 7:04 a.m. local time in the Haifa Bay and Western Galilee regions. Most of these were successfully neutralized by the defense systems, while the remainder landed in unpopulated areas. Israel Police noted that fragments from the interceptions landed mainly in Kiryat Yam, located just north of Haifa, causing some property damage but no injuries were reported. Additionally, at 7:23 a.m. local time, sirens in the Upper Galilee area signaled the crossing of 'multiple projectiles' from Lebanon. The military confirmed that some were intercepted and others fell in open areas, though the full impact of this event remains uncertain.The post Israeli Military Reports 20 Projectiles Fired from Lebanon into Israel first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-military-20-projectiles-fired-from-lebanon-israel/	2024-10-03T23:52:23-07:00	
Hezbollah Leader Agreed to Ceasefire Days Before Assassination	Lebanon's Foreign Minister, Abdallah Bou Habib, revealed to CNN's Christiane Amanpour that just days before his assassination, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah had consented to a 21-day ceasefire. This truce was advocated by U.S. President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, and other international allies during the recent UN General Assembly. Habib confirmed Nasrallah's agreement in the interview, noting that Lebanon, after consultations with Hezbollah and Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berri, had aligned with the ceasefire. He added that both the U.S. and French governments were informed of this agreement, which was also supposedly affirmed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as per the joint statement by Presidents Biden and Macron. The plan was for White House senior adviser Amos Hochstein to travel to Lebanon to negotiate the details of the ceasefire. However, Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut's southern suburbs shortly thereafter. This announcement came just a day after a joint statement by several countries, including the United States, France, and others, calling for a 21-day ceasefire to enable diplomatic efforts and prevent further escalations. Sources close to the negotiations indicated that Hezbollah had agreed to the ceasefire shortly before the U.S. proposal was made public. It was suggested that such an agreement would have required Nasrallah's approval, although it was not confirmed if the decision came directly from him. Conversely, a Biden administration official expressed that they had no prior knowledge of Nasrallah's personal agreement to the ceasefire. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller echoed this sentiment, stating that while diplomatic talks were ongoing about the ceasefire proposal, the U.S. had not been informed of Hezbollah's consent. Hezbollah did not make any public declaration about their stance on the ceasefire. It seemed they were awaiting Israel's response to the international call for a ceasefire issued by the U.S., France, and other allies. Despite the agreement, the ceasefire was short-lived. Netanyahu soon declared that Israel would persist in its aggressive actions against Hezbollah. This discrepancy was later described by Israeli officials as a misunderstanding, believing the ceasefire proposal was merely the beginning of a process towards peace. Following these events, the U.S. refrained from further advocating for the ceasefire once it became apparent that Israel might target Nasrallah. In light of queries regarding the diminishing influence of the United States in the region, Habib emphasized the critical role of the U.S. in achieving a ceasefire, though he remained uncertain about the extent of support Lebanon could expect.The post Hezbollah Leader Agreed to Ceasefire Days Before Assassination first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-leader-agreed-ceasefire-days-before-assassination/	2024-10-03T23:52:08-07:00

Intense Israeli Airstrikes Hit Dahieh, Reportedly Targeting Safie...	Sources familiar with Hezbollah revealed that Israel executed 11 back-to-back airstrikes on the organization's stronghold in southern Beirut late Thursday. This marked one of the most intense bombardments since Israel escalated its offensive last week. According to three Israeli officials cited by Axios, these attacks aimed at eliminating Hezbollah's senior leader, Sayyed Hashem Safieddine. Loud explosions during these raids triggered car alarms and shook buildings across the Lebanese capital, as reported by AFP correspondents. The aftermath was visually captured with footage displaying massive fireballs and dense smoke at the strike site, while flares illuminated the area. Lebanon's National News Agency (NNA) confirmed that this sequence of over ten airstrikes constituted one of the fiercest assaults on Beirut's southern suburbs since the conflict's onset. The impact of these strikes reverberated into the surrounding mountainous regions, added the NNA. Earlier that day, the Israeli army’s Arabic-language spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, issued a critical evacuation warning to residents near the Bourj al-Barajneh area of south Beirut, hinting at imminent military actions due to the proximity of Hezbollah facilities. Further details emerged about another airstrike targeting a warehouse near Beirut airport earlier in the evening, which a Hezbollah-related source discussed with AFP. However, the contents of the warehouse remain unspecified. Reports by the NNA earlier in the day described several 'enemy raids,' with one source mentioning that these earlier strikes aimed at a building used by Hezbollah's media relations, which had been evacuated beforehand. This recent escalation follows Israel's announcement of ground operations in southern Lebanon, subsequent to prolonged aerial bombardments targeting Hezbollah areas throughout Lebanon. This military shift has led to significant casualties, with the conflict claiming over 1,000 lives and displacing hundreds of thousands.

The IDF released the names of the deceased soldiers, identifying them as follows: 1. Captain Eitan Itzhak Oster, 22, a team commander in the Egoz Commando Unit, from Modi’in. 2. Captain Harel Etinger, 23, a team commander in the Egoz Commando Unit, from Eli. 3. Captain Itai Ariel Giat, 23, from the Yahalom Combat Engineering Unit, residing in Shoham. 4.

Additionally, the aftermath of this encounter also saw an officer and four soldiers sustain severe injuries. During the operation to evacuate the injured, IDF troops were targeted by mortar fire from Hezbollah, resulting in further casualties. In a separate incident, two soldiers from the Golani reconnaissance unit were killed. Hezbollah claimed it had destroyed three Israeli Merkava tanks on the same day as they moved toward the Lebanese village of Maroun al-Ras, near the border.The post Eight Israeli Soldiers Killed in Lebanon as Clashes with Hezbollah Escalate first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/eight-israeli-soldiers-killed-lebanon/	2024-10-03T03:39:11-07:00	
Israeli Strike on Beirut Health Center Kills Seven Rescuers	Late Wednesday, an Israeli airstrike devastated a Hezbollah-affiliated rescue facility in Beirut's Bashoura district, killing seven paramedics, as reported by the Lebanese health ministry. The strike targeted a multi-story building that included an office of the Islamic Health Organization, a group associated with Hezbollah and comprising civilian first responders. This attack, notably close to Beirut's central downtown area—home to UN and government offices—marked a significant escalation, being one of the nearest strikes to this crucial district. According to the Islamic Health Organization, the airstrike not only resulted in deaths but also left several individuals wounded, destroying a floor of the building in the process. Journalists from AFP in Beirut reported hearing a loud explosion that caused buildings to shake. This incident was part of a series of attacks that included another direct strike on the Islamic Health Organization within 24 hours, both of which occurred without prior warnings from Israel. Typically, Israeli airstrikes have focused on the southern and eastern parts of Lebanon and the southern suburbs of Beirut, areas known for a strong Hezbollah presence. However, the scope of these attacks has expanded across Lebanon, resulting in numerous civilian casualties. Following this particular attack, residents reported a sulfur-like odor, leading to accusations by Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency that Israel used internationally banned phosphorous bombs. There have been previous allegations by human rights groups against Israel for deploying white phosphorus incendiary shells in southern Lebanon's conflict zones. The Israeli military has not yet responded to these allegations or commented on the strike in central Beirut. Additionally, Beirut's southern suburbs endured severe bombings overnight. Israel executed three air raids just before midnight Wednesday, with the blasts audible from several kilometers away. Subsequently, residents in various parts of the densely populated southern Beirut received evacuation orders from the Israeli military, disseminated via social media. The Lebanese health ministry disclosed that, over the past 24 hours, Israeli strikes had killed 46 people and injured 85 across the nation. According to Lebanon's disaster management agency, the death toll since the onset of cross-border exchanges between Israel and Hezbollah following the Gaza war on October 7, 2023, has reached 1,928.The post Israeli Strike on Beirut Health Center Kills Seven Rescuers first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strike-beirut-center-kills-seven-rescuers/	2024-10-03T03:17:29-07:00	
Hezbollah Claims It Thwarted Israeli Advance on Southern Border	Hezbollah successfully repelled an attempt by Israeli forces to advance at a southern Lebanon border point on Thursday. They reported that this confrontation occurred at Fatima's Gate, just one day after Israel confirmed the deaths of eight of its soldiers in the area. On Wednesday, Israel had initiated 'targeted ground raids' in southern Lebanon, during which Hezbollah claimed to have forced Israeli soldiers to retreat, using explosives against an Israeli unit and destroying three Merkava tanks with rockets near the village of Maroun al-Ras. Israel conducted two brief incursions into Lebanon, urging residents to evacuate over 20 areas. They released footage purportedly showing their soldiers navigating through Lebanese villages and mountainous terrain on foot. To bolster their efforts, Israel deployed an additional military division. Iran's missile attack Shortly after Israel commenced ground operations in Lebanon, Iran launched approximately 200 missiles, including hypersonic ones, prompting Israelis to seek shelter. Although Israel intercepted most missiles, two individuals were injured by shrapnel, and a school suffered damage. Some missiles hit air force bases in Israel but caused no casualties or damage. In the West Bank city of Jericho, a Palestinian was tragically killed by debris from a rocket. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant issued a stern warning in response to the attacks, emphasizing the consequences for aggressions against Israel. Despite the tensions, President Joe Biden affirmed U.S. support for Israel but dismissed the possibility of striking Iran’s nuclear sites. Iran's military leadership vowed to escalate their attacks if Israel retaliated. The Revolutionary Guards stated that the missile barrage was in retaliation for the killing of Hezbollah's Nasrallah, Quds Force commander Abbas Nilforoushan, and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. Global reaction The situation has caused significant international concern, affecting global markets and raising oil prices. The UN Secretary-General condemned Iran’s actions, while the G7 pledged to seek diplomatic resolutions to ease regional tensions. Hezbollah initiated strikes on Israeli troops following a Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, which precipitated an extensive Israeli military response in Gaza, resulting in significant civilian casualties.The post Hezbollah Claims It Thwarted Israeli Advance on Southern Border first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-claims-thwarted-israeli-advance-southern-border/	2024-10-03T03:17:08-07:00	
Watch: Breaking: Nasrallah’s Son-in-Law Killed in Israeli Raid on...	The son-in-law of the late Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli raid in Damascus on Wednesday, according to a report by an NGO. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights stated, 'In a residential area of Damascus's Mazze district, an Israeli raid targeted an apartment, resulting in the death of Hassan Jaafar Qassir, Nasrallah's son-in-law, along with another Lebanese individual.' This account was corroborated by a source close to Hezbollah who spoke to AFP. Hassan Jaafar Qassir was the brother of Ahmad Qassir, who conducted a suicide bombing in the southern Lebanese city of Tyre in 1982, killing multiple Israeli soldiers. Another brother, Mohammad Qassir, was killed in an Israeli strike in the Jnah area of Beirut on Tuesday. According to the Israeli military, Mohammad Qassir led Hezbollah’s Unit 4400, responsible for transporting weapons from Iran to Lebanon and overseeing the development of precision-guided missiles. He was also said to have directed substantial financial resources to Hezbollah in recent years.The post Watch: Breaking: Nasrallah’s Son-in-Law Killed in Israeli Raid on Damascus first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/nasrallahs-son-law-killed-israeli-raid-damascus/	2024-10-03T03:16:56-07:00

EU Increases Lebanon Aid by 30 Million Euros	The European Union announced on Thursday that it is providing an additional 30 million euros ($33 million) in humanitarian aid to Lebanon amid ongoing conflicts between Israel and Hezbollah. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated, 'Today, we are stepping up our humanitarian aid to the people of Lebanon. Our new funding will ensure civilians receive much-needed assistance during this very difficult time. I am extremely concerned by the constant escalation of tensions in the Middle East. All parties must do their utmost to protect the lives of innocent civilians.' This recent commitment increases the EU's total humanitarian support for Lebanon this year to over 100 million euros, following a 10 million euro allocation announced earlier in the week. Meanwhile, Israel has intensified its military actions in Lebanon, including a bombing campaign and deploying troops across the border. These actions have resulted in over 1,900 deaths, including the killing of Hezbollah's long-standing leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah in an airstrike. According to Lebanese authorities, the ongoing strikes have displaced approximately one million people.The post EU Increases Lebanon Aid by 30 Million Euros first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/eu-increases-lebanon-aid-30-million-euros/	2024-10-03T03:15:47-07:00	
Israel Mobilizes Four Reserve Brigades for Northern ‘Operation’	On Tuesday, the Israeli military announced the mobilization of four additional brigades for deployment along the northern border. This decision follows claims of overnight ground operations targeting Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon. The military stated, 'This deployment will facilitate ongoing operations against the Hezbollah terrorist organization and help achieve strategic objectives, including ensuring the safe return of residents in northern Israel to their homes.' Despite these developments, there were no indications of active ground combat in southern Lebanon late Monday and early Tuesday. Sources from Hezbollah, the army, and the UNIFIL confirmed they had not observed any Israeli forces crossing into Lebanon.The post Israel Mobilizes Four Reserve Brigades for Northern ‘Operation’ first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-reserve-brigades-northern-operation/	2024-10-02T03:41:14-07:00	
Egypt Slams Israel’s ‘Serious Escalation’ in Lebanon	On Tuesday, Egypt's chief diplomat expressed strong disapproval of what he described as Israel's 'serious escalation' in southern Lebanon, following the Israeli military's announcement of a 'limited and focused' ground incursion. Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelaty issued a warning that this escalation by Israel could potentially ignite widespread regional instability, resulting in severe security and humanitarian repercussions. This statement was released by the Egyptian Foreign Ministry. Additionally, Abdelaty emphasized Egypt's firm opposition to any efforts that might lead to a new status quo, infringing upon Lebanon’s sovereignty.The post Egypt Slams Israel’s ‘Serious Escalation’ in Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/egypt-slams-israels-escalation-lebanon/	2024-10-02T03:41:08-07:00	
Israel Orders Evacuation of 29 South Lebanon Towns Amid Ground Op...	On Tuesday, the Israeli army instructed residents of 29 southern Lebanese towns to evacuate northward beyond the Awali River, amid what it termed a 'limited' ground incursion. The towns specified for evacuation include Yaroun, Ain Ebel, Maroun al-Ras, al-Tiri, and others, extending to Aitaroun. The Israeli military emphasized the urgency of moving to ensure safety, stating, 'The Israeli army does not want to harm you and for your own safety you must evacuate your homes immediately. Anyone in proximity to Hezbollah members or their military assets is in danger.' The directive specifically advised residents to move north of the Awali River, which is about 60 kilometers from the border and further north than the Litani River. The Litani River previously marked the northern limit of a U.N.-declared buffer zone established after the 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. The army's message warned, 'Be careful, you are not allowed to go south. Going south could put your life in danger. We will let you know when it is safe to return home.' This evacuation order followed shortly after Israeli forces commenced a ground operation in southern Lebanon targeting Hezbollah. The instructions were disseminated by the Israeli military’s Arabic spokesman via the social media platform X.The post Israel Orders Evacuation of 29 South Lebanon Towns Amid Ground Operation first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-evacuation-29-south-lebanon-towns/	2024-10-02T03:40:56-07:00	
UNIFIL, Hezbollah, and Army Deny Israeli Ground Incursion in Sout...	On Tuesday, the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, reported that there was no ongoing ground incursion in the south of the country, contradicting Israel's claims of conducting limited raids in the area. UNIFIL spokesperson Andrea Tenenti clarified to AFP that there was currently no ground incursion, following Israel's military announcement that it had initiated 'limited, localized and targeted raids' against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. Similarly, Hezbollah refuted the presence of any Israeli ground forces in Lebanon. In their first response since Israel declared the commencement of ground operations, Hezbollah spokesman Mohammed Afifi labeled the reports of Israeli troops entering Lebanon as 'false claims.' He asserted that Hezbollah fighters were prepared to engage directly with any Israeli forces attempting to enter Lebanon to inflict casualties. An Israeli military official indicated that their troops were positioned close to the border, focusing on villages a few hundred meters from Israel. Speaking anonymously in accordance with military guidelines, the official noted that there had been no encounters with Hezbollah fighters on the ground. Additionally, a source from the Lebanese army confirmed on Tuesday that they had not detected any Israeli ground incursion into Lebanese territory, also speaking to AFP under the condition of anonymity.The post UNIFIL, Hezbollah, and Army Deny Israeli Ground Incursion in South Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/unifil-hezbollah-army-deny-israeli-ground-incursion-lebanon/	2024-10-02T03:40:38-07:00

The Israeli military has disclosed that it has been conducting covert ground operations over the past year aimed at dismantling Hezbollah's infrastructure in Lebanese villages near the border, according to military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari. Hagari explained on Tuesday that these operations are an extension of efforts initiated last year. The military has shared video footage showing Israeli soldiers discovering tunnels and weapons caches in at least three Lebanese villages. During these operations, Israeli forces have destroyed over 700 Hezbollah sites. These include tunnels built into hillsides, which contain separate rooms used for storing weapons and apparent living quarters equipped with mattresses. Furthermore, Hagari noted that Hezbollah appears to be planning an attack similar to the one executed on October 7 against Israel, judging by the strategic placement of weapon caches and maps found during the raids. These documents included references to a strategy known as 'Conquer the Galilee.'The post Israeli Military Releases Footage of Past Ground Operations in Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-military-footage-past-operations-lebanon/	2024-10-02T03:40:25-07:00	
Israeli Army Hits Jnah and Kuwait Embassy Roundabout in South Bei...	On Tuesday, the Israeli military executed a targeted strike in south Beirut, according to an IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) statement which did not provide further specifics. Meanwhile, local media reported that the strikes occurred simultaneously at an apartment in a building near al-Zahraa Hospital in Jnah and another location in Beirut's southern suburbs. The Lebanese state-run National News Agency confirmed that Israeli forces targeted two locations in south Beirut. The agency described a 'violent enemy strike' between Jnah and Ouzai, close to al-Zahraa Hospital, followed shortly by another strike near a roundabout close to the Kuwaiti embassy. One of the airstrikes damaged a residential building, shattering windows and impacting an apartment located on the southern highway leading to Beirut international airport, roughly 100 meters from the Iranian Embassy. The IDF claimed responsibility for the death of Mohammed Jaafar Qassir in the afternoon strike. Qassir was reportedly the head of Hezbollah’s Unit 4400, responsible for transporting weapons from Iran to Lebanon and overseeing the development of precision-guided missiles for Hezbollah. Additionally, the Israeli military stated that Qassir had funneled hundreds of millions of dollars to Hezbollah in recent years. Hezbollah has not yet responded to these allegations. Qassir’s brother, Ahmad, was known for carrying out a suicide attack in Tyre, a southern Lebanese port city, in 1982 that resulted in the deaths of numerous Israeli soldiers. His death is commemorated annually as 'Martyr's Day.'The post Israeli Army Hits Jnah and Kuwait Embassy Roundabout in South Beirut first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-army-hits-jnah-kuwait-embassy-south-beirut/	2024-10-02T02:54:09-07:00	
Iran Launches Missile Strike on Israel in Retaliation for Nasrall...	Air traffic at Israel's Ben Gurion airport was suspended on Tuesday following a series of explosions across the country, triggered by a missile attack from Iran, according to a spokesperson. The missile assault by Iran's Revolutionary Guards was reportedly in retaliation for the deaths of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, as well as Revolutionary Guards commander Nilforoshan. 'We targeted the heart of the occupied territories (Israel) in response to the martyrdom of these leaders,' stated the Guards in a release cited by Fars news agency. The Guards also issued a stern warning of 'crushing attacks' against Israel should there be any retaliation. Loud explosions were heard in Tel Aviv and near Jerusalem, with the blasts near Jerusalem causing windows to rattle. Residents were instructed to stay indoors and remain near bomb shelters through alerts on mobile phones and announcements on national television. Sirens were reported in various parts of Jerusalem and central Israel. The Israeli army communicated to the public, 'Iran's attack is ongoing. You are requested to remain in a protected space until further notice. The sounds you are hearing are from interceptions or fallen projectiles.' In response to the attacks, President Joe Biden directed the U.S. military to support Israel's defense by intercepting Iranian missiles aimed at Israel. This directive was issued from the White House, where both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee in the upcoming U.S. presidential election, were monitoring the situation.The post Iran Launches Missile Strike on Israel in Retaliation for Nasrallah’s Killing first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/iran-missile-strike-israel-retaliation/	2024-10-02T02:52:57-07:00

Furthermore, Hezbollah claimed to have launched rockets and artillery at a significant Israeli infantry group located in Misgav Am, just across the border. They also targeted troop gatherings at three additional sites, using Burkan rockets in one of the assaults. In recent developments, Israel has intensified its bombardment of southern Lebanon since the previous week.

Israeli Strike on Damascus Kills 3, Including TV Anchor, Syrian S...	Safaa Ahmed, a prominent Syrian television anchor, was killed in an overnight Israeli strike on Damascus along with two others, according to a report by the Syrian state news agency SANA. SANA announced that Safaa Ahmed died as a result of what it called a 'treacherous Israeli aggression on the capital, Damascus.' The Syrian defense ministry reported that the Israeli attack, involving drones and planes, occurred around 2 a.m. local time from the direction of the Golan Heights, which Israel occupies. The ministry claimed that its air defense systems engaged the attacking missiles and drones, managing to intercept most of them. However, the strike resulted in three civilian deaths and injuries to nine others. Social media videos, which CNN geolocated, indicate that an explosion occurred near Syria’s Telecom building, located west of the city’s military airport. Another video showed a car ablaze following the explosion. It remains unclear if Ahmed and the other casualties were at this specific location when they were killed; SANA did not provide details on the exact location of their deaths. When approached for comments on these reports, the Israeli military did not provide a statement, maintaining their policy of not commenting on foreign media reports. For context, Israel has intermittently conducted airstrikes in Syria since the attacks by Hamas on October 7 of the previous year, typically without confirming these operations.The post Israeli Strike on Damascus Kills 3, Including TV Anchor, Syrian State Media Reports first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strike-damascus-kills-3-tv-anchor/	2024-10-01T02:55:00-07:00	
Analysis: US Influence Dwindles as Israel’s War Expands	Israel's anticipated military push into Lebanon marks a significant shift, underscoring a year-long conflict that reveals the diminished ability of the United States to control its ally or sway other key combatants in an escalating regional crisis. On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu advanced his campaign against Hezbollah with a so-called 'limited ground operation' in Lebanon. This action came despite prolonged pleas from Washington for Israel to show restraint and continued, albeit ignored, calls for de-escalation. This development occurred shortly after President Joe Biden expressed his support for an immediate ceasefire when queried about recent Israeli special forces operations in southern Lebanon. 'I'm comfortable with them stopping,' Biden stated. His remarks highlighted a growing rift between the U.S. and Israeli administrations. On the same day, Netanyahu boldly proclaimed to the Iranians in a televised message that 'Israel can reach anywhere in the Middle East.' This widening gap between the two governments aligns with the closing stages of a tense U.S. election, where Biden faces restricted political leeway to manage the war's domestic implications without causing further upheaval. This situation is something Netanyahu, who is adept at navigating U.S. political waters, is likely very aware of. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, has generally adhered to the administration's position, despite previous statements suggesting a possibly firmer approach towards Netanyahu and a focus on the hardships faced by Palestinian civilians.The post Analysis: US Influence Dwindles as Israel’s War Expands first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-influence-dwindles-israels-war-expands/	2024-10-01T01:28:59-07:00

During the call, Austin and Gallant concurred on the importance of dismantling the operational capabilities at the border to prevent attacks similar to those on October 7 against northern Israeli communities, as stated by Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder. The Israeli military has initiated a targeted ground operation in southern Lebanon aimed at Hezbollah, according to their reports. Additionally, when President Joe Biden was queried about Israeli special forces' actions in southern Lebanon, he expressed support for an immediate ceasefire, noting his readiness for the operations to cease. The Pentagon statement further highlighted that Secretary Austin assured the U.S. is ready to protect its personnel, partners, and allies against threats posed by Iran and groups supported by Iran. Austin and Minister Gallant also discussed the grave repercussions for Iran should it directly attack Israel militarily.The post US Defense Secretary Talks with Israeli Counterpart as Israel Begins Ground Incursion in Southern Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-defense-secretary-talks-israeli-counterpart/	2024-10-01T01:28:37-07:00	
UAE Pledges $100 Million Aid to Lebanon as UN Urges De-escalation	The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has committed to providing Lebanon with an aid package worth $100 million, as it raises concerns about the precarious situation in Lebanon and its implications for regional stability. This announcement was made by the state-run Emirates News Agency. The UAE's foreign ministry further expressed a strong commitment to Lebanon's unity, national sovereignty, and territorial integrity. The ministry underscored its continued support for the Lebanese people during these difficult times, as stated in a press release. This financial assistance arrives at a critical time, as the United Nations’ Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) highlights the severe impact recent conflicts have had on civilians in Lebanon. OCHA has called on the international community to actively support de-escalation efforts, ensure compliance with international humanitarian law, and prioritize urgent aid for those affected. The situation is further strained by the Lebanese aid sector's current challenges, as noted by the Lebanon country director of Relief International in a CNN interview on Sunday. He mentioned that the sector is struggling due to the displacement of approximately 1 million people in Lebanon following Israeli attacks. Additionally, the World Food Programme is responding to the crisis by initiating an emergency operation to enhance food support for up to 1 million people in need throughout Lebanon.The post UAE Pledges $100 Million Aid to Lebanon as UN Urges De-escalation first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/uae-100-million-aid-lebanon-un-urges-deescalation/	2024-10-01T01:28:15-07:00

This morning, Hezbollah launched attacks on Metula in northern Israel, just hours after an Israeli military operation into Lebanon. Hezbollah confirmed that its forces had targeted an Israeli soldier assembly in Metula using artillery and rocket fire, claiming successful strikes on the targets. The group stated that these attacks were carried out to support the 'steadfast Palestinian people' in Gaza and to defend Lebanon and its inhabitants. In response, the Israeli military reported that it detected about five projectiles coming from Lebanon. Some of these were intercepted, and others were found in the vicinity, though the specific locations of their landing were not disclosed. Additionally, the Israeli forces intercepted two other projectiles in a separate incident.

How Will Iran React to Israel’s Escalating Strikes on Its Proxies...	Israel is intensifying its military operations against Iran-supported groups, including launching a limited ground invasion into Lebanon targeting Hezbollah and executing long-range strikes on Houthi forces in Yemen. These actions come amid growing concerns about a potential extensive regional conflict. Hezbollah, the Houthis, and Hamas, which initiated attacks on Israel on October 7, are part of the 'Axis of Resistance' backed by Iran, which includes various Islamist militias across Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Gaza, and Yemen. Over the past year, Hezbollah and the Houthis have frequently attacked Israel, pledging to continue their assaults until the conflict in Gaza concludes. Recently, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly criticized Iran. In a broadcast speech, he expressed solidarity with the Iranian populace, bypassing any intermediaries, and urged them to oppose their leadership. Netanyahu also reiterated his warning about Israel's capability to strike targets anywhere in the Middle East. A U.S. senior official disclosed to CNN that if Iran perceives a threat of losing Hezbollah in this conflict, it might directly intervene. The ongoing Israeli operations have significantly reduced Hezbollah's capabilities, removing hundreds of their fighters from the field. During an operation that eliminated Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah, a high-ranking officer from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp was also killed. In retaliation, Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has threatened Israel with severe repercussions.The post How Will Iran React to Israel’s Escalating Strikes on Its Proxies? first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/how-iran-react-israels-strikes-proxies/	2024-10-01T01:15:44-07:00	
Isn’t Israel Fighting Hamas in Gaza? Why Are Israeli Troops Now i...	Since the conflict in Gaza started last October after Hamas attacked Israel, Israel and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah have seen increased hostilities. Hezbollah has declared it will continue its attacks on Israel until a ceasefire is achieved in Gaza, which has suffered extensive damage due to Israeli airstrikes and ongoing conflict. Recently, Israel has shifted its military focus northward, setting a new objective to facilitate the return of displaced citizens to their homes near the Lebanon border. This adjustment comes after approximately 60,000 Israelis were displaced due to rocket attacks by Hezbollah. This has led to some of the most intense clashes between Israel and Hezbollah since the 2006 war in Lebanon, which resulted in around 1,100 deaths in Lebanon. Last month, Israel conducted a coordinated attack targeting Hezbollah, resulting in numerous casualties and severe injuries among thousands, including women and children, through the explosion of devices like pagers and walkie-talkies. Moreover, Israel has intensified its bombing campaigns in Lebanon, aiming at Hezbollah’s infrastructure and leadership. These bombings have not only targeted militant strongholds but have also destroyed residential areas and neighborhoods, particularly in southern Beirut, resulting in the deaths of several Hezbollah leaders and over a thousand civilians.The post Isn’t Israel Fighting Hamas in Gaza?

Lebanese Army Denies Reports of Withdrawal from Southern Lebanon	On Tuesday, the Lebanese military refuted claims that it had retracted its forces several kilometers from positions along the southern border in response to Israel's recent ground invasion into the region. The Army Command clarified that these reports were not accurate. It explained that Lebanese military units stationed in the south are merely adjusting the positions of some forward observation points within their assigned operational zones, not withdrawing. The army also confirmed its ongoing collaboration with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon to manage the situation. CNN has reported that it cannot independently confirm the movements of the Lebanese army. This response from the Lebanese military came after a Lebanese security source indicated to CNN on Monday that the army had vacated several observation posts along the southern border, relocating to nearby border village barracks.The post Lebanese Army Denies Reports of Withdrawal from Southern Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lebanese-denies-reports-withdrawal-lebanon/	2024-10-01T01:15:26-07:00	
Watch: Israeli Troops Launch Ground Offensive in Southern Lebanon...	Israel has initiated what it describes as a 'limited ground operation' in southern Lebanon, specifically targeting Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militant group. This marks a significant escalation in the year-long conflict, with Israel’s National Security Cabinet declaring this move as the 'next phase' of its war with Hezbollah. This is only the fourth time in nearly 50 years that Israeli forces have publicly entered Lebanese territory, the last being during the 34-day war in 2006. In preparation for the operation, Israel intensified airstrikes, which have killed hundreds and displaced around 1 million people in Lebanon. The most recent escalation came after Israel's assassination of Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, on Friday. The incursion is focused on dismantling immediate threats posed by Hezbollah near the border, but Israeli officials have been unclear on how long the operation will last or how deep into Lebanon their forces will venture. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant stated that Nasrallah’s assassination was a key move but that further actions were planned. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has resisted international calls for de-escalation despite growing civilian casualties in both Lebanon and Gaza. Historically, limited military operations declared by Israel have often evolved into more extended campaigns. This was the case with Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon in 1982, initially presented as a short mission to dismantle the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO). More recently, Israel’s operations in Gaza have similarly escalated beyond their original scope. In the lead-up to this ground operation, Israel’s National Security Cabinet greenlit the next phase of the conflict, while Israeli forces prepared by launching small raids and sealing off northern Israeli communities near the Lebanon border. Hezbollah has continued its attacks on Israel, aiming for a ceasefire in Gaza. Israel's military objectives have shifted northward, particularly after Hezbollah’s rocket attacks displaced around 60,000 Israelis. With rising tensions and the heaviest fighting since the 2006 war, concerns have grown that the conflict could spiral into a wider regional war. In the face of Hezbollah's losses, questions remain about whether its backer, Iran, will become directly involved in the conflict. Israeli leaders, particularly Netanyahu, have signaled that the war is part of a broader strategy to 'change the balance of power' in the Middle East. Iran has been involved indirectly through Hezbollah and other militant groups in the region but has refrained from direct conflict so far. Observers are concerned that any direct Iranian retaliation could potentially draw the U.S. further into the conflict. The U.S. has supported Israel's right to defend itself but has expressed concerns over 'mission creep' that could lead to a longer, more expansive military operation. President Joe Biden proposed a 21-day ceasefire plan, but it was swiftly rejected by Israel, highlighting the ongoing strain between Washington and Tel Aviv in managing the escalating crisis.The post Watch: Israeli Troops Launch Ground Offensive in Southern Lebanon: What We Know So Far first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-troops-offensive-lebanon-what-know/	2024-10-01T01:15:01-07:00	
Israel Declares Northern Border a 'Closed Military Zone'	The Israeli military announced on Monday that it had designated parts of its northern border with Lebanon as a military zone, ahead of potential ground operations. 'The areas of Metula, Misgav Am, and Kfar Giladi in northern Israel have been declared closed military zones, with entry prohibited,' said the military in a statement. This declaration does not necessarily indicate that Israeli forces will imminently enter Lebanon. Such areas can also be restricted if there is a perceived immediate threat. However, the Israeli army has significantly reinforced its presence along the Lebanese border in recent days. Commanders have stated they are ready to deploy forces if ordered by the government. Chris Coyle, a resident of northern Israel, noted that gates and checkpoints had been set up throughout the region, and numerous tanks had been stationed near the border. 'They’re definitely preparing to go in,' he observed.The post Israel Declares Northern Border a 'Closed Military Zone' first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-northern-border-closed-military-zone/	2024-09-30T12:18:19-07:00

This move comes in response to threats of an Israeli incursion targeting Hezbollah, following reports from the U.S. that Israel had notified it about conducting limited ground operations inside Lebanon. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that the army is 'repositioning and regrouping forces' in the region.The post Breaking: Army Repositions Troops on Southern Border Amid Israeli Incursion Threat first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/army-repositions-troops-southern-border/	2024-09-30T12:17:29-07:00	
Breaking: Israel Conducting Limited Operations Inside Lebanon	The U.S. State Department confirmed on Monday that Israel is conducting limited ground operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon. According to State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller, Israel has informed the U.S. that these operations target Hezbollah infrastructure near the border. On the same day, Israel's Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, hinted at the possibility of a broader offensive against Hezbollah, stating that Israel would deploy forces 'from the air, from the sea, and on land' as needed. This warning came as parts of Israel's northern border with Lebanon were declared a closed zone by the Israeli military. The escalation follows Hezbollah's low-intensity strikes on Israeli forces, which began shortly after Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, sparking conflict in Gaza. Since then, clashes along the border have intensified, with Israeli airstrikes inside Lebanon killing hundreds, including Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. Reports indicate that Israel has already launched small, precision raids across the border and may be planning a larger ground operation, while artillery strikes have been hitting southern Lebanese villages near the border.The post Breaking: Israel Conducting Limited Operations Inside Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-limited-operations-inside-lebanon/	2024-09-30T12:17:08-07:00	
Syrian Refugees Fleeing Lebanon, Returning Home as Conflict Escal...	Syrian refugees who once sought safety in Lebanon are now returning to Syria, facing an uncertain future. According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), around 100,000 people, including both Lebanese and Syrians, have crossed back into Syria to escape Israeli airstrikes. The bombardments have forced one million people to flee their homes in Lebanon, according to the country's caretaker prime minister. Lebanon is home to approximately 1.5 million Syrian refugees, the UNHCR reports. 'They came to Lebanon seeking safety, and now they are reliving that trauma,' said Rula Amin, the senior spokesperson for UNHCR in the Middle East and North Africa. Speaking to CNN’s Michael Holmes, Amin described the situation as 'tragic,' with civilians struggling to find refuge. Israel’s shifting targets in Lebanon make it difficult for people to identify safe areas to shelter. Although residents are advised to avoid Hezbollah-operated areas, the group's secretive nature leaves them unsure where to go. Without sufficient shelters, many are left sleeping outdoors, Amin added. 'We have never seen anything like this before, not even in 2006,' she said, referring to the scale and intensity of the bombings. The widespread attacks have resulted in significant civilian casualties, with Lebanese authorities reporting over 1,000 deaths. Amin noted that UNHCR staff stationed at the Syrian-Lebanese border are witnessing thousands of people fleeing into Syria each day. 'They don’t know what tomorrow holds. All they know is that they need to keep running,' she said.The post Syrian Refugees Fleeing Lebanon, Returning Home as Conflict Escalates first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/syrian-refugees-fleeing-lebanon-returning-home/	2024-09-30T06:33:22-07:00	
Israeli Minister Hints at Imminent Ground Invasion of Lebanon	Israel’s defense minister has provided one of the clearest indications yet that the country is preparing for a ground incursion into Lebanon. 'The elimination of Nasrallah is a significant step, but it is not the final one,' Yoav Gallant told Israeli soldiers on Monday. 'We will use every capability at our disposal, and if anyone on the other side doesn't understand what those capabilities are, we mean *all* capabilities, and you are part of this effort.' Gallant made these remarks during a visit to Israel’s armored corps near the Lebanese border, addressing soldiers from brigade 188 and the Golani brigade, an infantry unit. While Israeli officials have hinted at such a possibility before, Gallant's comments on Monday were more direct, signaling that Israel is moving closer to a ground offensive in southern Lebanon. Last week, Herzi Halevi, Israel’s chief of the General Staff, told troops near the northern border that airstrikes on Lebanon were intended to 'prepare the ground for your possible entry and to continue degrading Hezbollah.' Gallant further emphasized Israel’s commitment to returning citizens who were displaced from their homes in the north of the country due to the conflict. 'We are ready to take every step necessary to accomplish this mission,' he said. 'We will employ all necessary means—your forces, others, from the air, from the sea, and on land. Good luck.'The post Israeli Minister Hints at Imminent Ground Invasion of Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-minister-hints-invasion-lebanon/	2024-09-30T06:33:07-07:00	
Israeli Strikes in Gaza Have Killed 41,615 Palestinians, Health M...	As Israel intensifies its military actions across various fronts in the region, airstrikes in Gaza have continued without much respite. According to Gaza's Ministry of Health, Israeli strikes have claimed the lives of at least 20 Palestinians and injured 108 others over the past 24 hours. The ministry further reported that the total death toll has reached at least 41,615, with 96,359 people wounded since the conflict began. Rescue efforts are hampered by the destruction, with many victims still trapped under debris or stranded on roads, which emergency services are unable to access. The Government Media Office in Gaza estimates that around 10,000 people remain missing and are believed to be buried beneath the rubble. Relief workers have previously informed CNN that damaged infrastructure from Israeli strikes is obstructing efforts to reach survivors. CNN has not independently verified the figures provided by the health ministry, which does not differentiate between civilian and combatant casualties.The post Israeli Strikes in Gaza Have Killed 41,615 Palestinians, Health Ministry Reports first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strikes-gaza-killed-41615-palestinians/	2024-09-30T06:32:49-07:00	
Saudi Arabia Demands Respect for Lebanon’s Sovereignty	Saudi Arabia voiced its 'deep concern' on Monday regarding the escalating conflict in Lebanon, urging that the 'sovereignty and territorial integrity' of the country be upheld. In a statement from the foreign ministry, Saudi Arabia said, 'The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is closely monitoring the situation in the Republic of Lebanon with great concern.' Following reports from Lebanon's health ministry that over a hundred people were killed by Israeli airstrikes on Sunday, Riyadh emphasized the importance of respecting Lebanon's sovereignty. 'The Kingdom calls on the international community to fulfill its responsibilities in maintaining regional peace and security, to protect the region and its people from the devastation of wars,' the statement continued. Israel has been conducting lethal airstrikes in Lebanon for several days, culminating in the death of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Iran-backed Hezbollah, along with other senior members of the group on Friday. As tensions escalate, there are increasing international calls for Israel to show restraint, with concerns mounting over the potential for a full-scale war in the Middle East as Israel prepares for a possible ground offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon.The post Saudi Arabia Demands Respect for Lebanon’s Sovereignty first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/saudi-arabia-respect-lebanons-sovereignty/	2024-09-30T06:32:11-07:00

French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot met with Maronite Patriarch Beshara al-Rahi on Monday, highlighting the urgency of electing a new president in Lebanon and calling for an end to the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, according to a Bkirki spokesperson. Barrot arrived in Lebanon on Sunday evening, making him the first senior foreign official to visit since the escalation of Israeli air strikes. In a meeting with caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati, Barrot conveyed France’s call for 'an immediate halt' to the Israeli strikes. On Monday, he is also scheduled to meet with key Lebanese leaders, including Army Chief Joseph Aoun and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri. France Delivers 12 Tons of Medical Aid to Lebanon France has provided 12 tons of medical supplies to Lebanon, which includes two mobile clinics capable of treating 1,000 critically injured patients currently in hospitals across the country, according to a statement from the French Foreign Ministry. Additionally, French military aircraft have delivered vital medicine to Lebanese emergency, pediatric, and general hospitals and clinics, many of which have been overwhelmed by the influx of injured people since Israel's bombardment began over a week ago. During his visit to Beirut, Barrot announced that France would allocate 10 million euros ($11.1 million) in emergency humanitarian aid to support local organizations, especially the Lebanese Red Cross. 'In the midst of the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, France stands in solidarity with Lebanon and remains committed to protecting civilians,' the statement read.The post France Pledges $11M in Emergency Aid to Lebanon During FM’s Beirut Visit first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/france-11m-emergency-aid-lebanon/	2024-09-30T06:29:54-07:00	
Israel Reportedly Rejects Ceasefire Proposal	Israel announced on Monday that it has rejected a ceasefire proposal with Hezbollah, which had been presented by mediators during recent discussions. According to Al-Hurra's correspondent in Tel Aviv, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz held talks with various foreign ministers following the assassination of Hezbollah Secretary-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. The ceasefire plan was among the topics discussed, but Katz made it clear that Israel would not agree to such a ceasefire in Lebanon. As reported by the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation, Katz communicated this position to more than 25 foreign ministers, including those from Germany, Britain, Italy, and Canada. He stated that Israel would only consider a ceasefire if Hezbollah is pushed north of the Litani River and disarmed. Katz explained that 'the full implementation of all U.N. Security Council resolutions related to Lebanon' is the only pathway to a ceasefire. Until that happens, Israel would continue its military operations to ensure the security of its citizens and allow residents in the northern regions to safely return to their homes. He also defended the assassination of Nasrallah, calling it one of the most justified actions Israel has undertaken, adding that Nasrallah had been planning further attacks against Israel. Katz further warned Iran, saying that any attack from Iran would be met with a retaliatory strike by Israel. Meanwhile, European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell expressed regret last Friday over the lack of influence to 'stop' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s actions in Gaza and Lebanon. Borrell stated, 'We are applying all diplomatic pressure to halt the fighting, but no one seems able to stop Netanyahu, whether in Gaza or the West Bank.' Borrell voiced support for a French and U.S.-led initiative calling for a 21-day ceasefire in Lebanon, but Israel has disregarded the proposal, continuing to intensify its strikes in the country.The post Israel Reportedly Rejects Ceasefire Proposal first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-reportedly-rejects-ceasefire-proposal/	2024-09-30T06:09:35-07:00	
EU Calls Emergency Talks on Lebanon Escalation	European foreign ministers are set to hold emergency talks on Monday to address the escalating situation in Lebanon, according to Brussels, as Israel continues its air strikes following the death of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. A spokesperson announced that Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief, had convened a video meeting at 1500 GMT to discuss the European Union’s response to the worsening crisis in Lebanon. International efforts are underway to prevent the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah from turning into a wider regional war. So far, the 27-member European Union has struggled to present a unified response or wield significant influence to de-escalate the violence that has shaken the region over the past year. On Monday, Israel launched its first air strike in Beirut’s city center since the Gaza conflict erupted last year, killing four people. This raid marked a significant intensification in the ongoing air campaign, which saw the assassination of Hezbollah's long-standing leader, Nasrallah, last Friday, further escalating tensions. Since last Monday, Israeli air strikes have killed hundreds in Lebanon, the deadliest period since the country’s civil war from 1975 to 1990. The Lebanese health ministry reported that more than 700 people have been killed, including 14 paramedics over two days of bombing. The U.N. refugee agency's head, Filippo Grandi, revealed that over 200,000 people have been displaced within Lebanon, while more than 100,000 have fled to neighboring Syria. After nearly a year of a devastating military campaign in Gaza, prompted by Hamas’s attack on October 7 last year, Israel has increasingly shifted its focus toward Hezbollah.The post EU Calls Emergency Talks on Lebanon Escalation first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/eu-calls-emergency-talks-lebanon-escalation/	2024-09-30T06:08:39-07:00

Hezbollah’s deputy leader, Sheikh Naim Qassem, delivered a televised address on Monday in tribute to the slain Hezbollah leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and vowed that the group would continue its fight. 'Sayyed Nasrallah will always remain with us,' Qassem assured Hezbollah’s members and fighters. Contrary to Israeli claims that a meeting of 20 officials was targeted when Nasrallah was killed, Qassem stated that Israel is committing massacres across Lebanon. He also criticized the U.S. for aiding Israel, stating, 'Israel is mistaken if it believes war will help it achieve its objectives.' Despite the unprecedented attacks, Qassem emphasized that Hezbollah has endured and will continue to follow Nasrallah’s path, maintaining its goals and support for Palestine. 'We won’t abandon our positions, and the resistance will keep aiding Palestine,' he said, adding that the battle could be prolonged, but Hezbollah’s fighters are prepared for any ground invasion, and they expect victory. Qassem stressed that Israel will not be able to weaken Hezbollah’s military capabilities and that the group will soon choose a new secretary-general. He also praised Lebanon’s 'national unity,' expressing gratitude to the government, political groups, NGOs, and hospitals.The post Hezbollah’s Qassem Vows to Fight, Promises Swift Replacement for Nasrallah first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/qassem-fight-promises-replacement-nasrallah/	2024-09-30T06:07:13-07:00

Study Suggests Earth Captured the Moon from Space, Rather Than Fo...	For nearly four decades, the widely accepted theory has been that the Moon formed from debris resulting from a massive collision between Earth and another celestial body. However, a new study presents an alternative possibility: What if the Moon wasn't formed this way, but instead was a separate object from space that Earth's gravity managed to capture? During the Apollo missions between 1969 and 1972, astronauts collected over 800 pounds of lunar rocks and soil for analysis. These samples were found to be compositionally similar to materials on Earth, leading scientists to conclude that the Moon originated from Earth, forming around 60 million years after the solar system came into existence. At the 1984 Kona Conference, scientists largely agreed that the Moon had resulted from a collision with a young Earth. But two Penn State researchers, Darren Williams and Michael Zugger, challenge this long-standing theory. Their study, published in *The Planetary Science Journal*, suggests that the Moon may not have formed from this collision after all. Instead, they propose the Moon might have been part of a binary system with Earth—two space bodies orbiting each other—until Earth’s gravity pulled the Moon in and ejected the other object. 'The Kona Conference shaped the prevailing narrative for 40 years,' said Williams, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at Penn State Behrend. But he and Zugger, a senior research engineer at Penn State’s Applied Research Lab, argue that this explanation leaves unresolved issues. Why the Moon likely came from elsewhere One key issue is the Moon's current position. If the Moon had formed from a collision, the debris would have clumped together and formed a ring orbiting above Earth's equator. Yet, the Moon orbits in a plane more aligned with the Sun than with Earth’s equator. 'The Moon’s orbit is more in sync with the Sun than Earth’s equator,' Williams explained. In their binary-exchange capture theory, Williams and Zugger argue that Earth’s gravity captured one of the two objects in the binary system, making it the Moon. The other object was repelled. They also highlight another similar case within our solar system: Triton, Neptune’s largest moon. Current research suggests Triton was captured into Neptune's orbit from the Kuiper Belt, a region filled with binary objects. Initially, according to Williams and Zugger, the Moon’s orbit around Earth was highly elliptical. Over time, extreme tidal forces altered its shape, eventually becoming the near-circular orbit we see today. The researchers calculated the tidal effects and the Moon’s orbit, determining that over thousands of years, the Moon's orbit contracted and became more circular.The post Study Suggests Earth Captured the Moon from Space, Rather Than Forming It first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/earth-captured-moon-space-rather-forming/	2024-09-28T23:56:14-07:00	
Biden Calls Nasrallah’s Death a 'Measure of Justice,' Reaffirms U...	On Saturday, September 28, U.S. President Joe Biden described the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah as 'a measure of justice,' highlighting the militant group's responsibility for the deaths of hundreds of Americans during Nasrallah's nearly 40-year leadership. Hezbollah officially confirmed that their leader was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut the day before. In a statement released by the White House, Biden remarked, 'Hassan Nasrallah and Hezbollah, the terrorist group he commanded, are responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans throughout his four decades of terror. His death in an Israeli airstrike serves as justice for his many victims, including thousands of Americans, Israelis, and Lebanese civilians.' Biden further explained that the strike occurred within the broader context of the conflict that erupted after Hamas's deadly assault on October 7, 2023. He noted that Nasrallah had made the critical decision to join forces with Hamas and open a 'northern front' against Israel. Reaffirming Washington's support for Israel, Biden stated, 'The United States fully supports Israel’s right to defend itself against Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and other Iranian-backed terrorist organizations.' On Friday, Biden had also directed U.S. Secretary of Defense to strengthen the military’s defensive posture in the Middle East to deter aggression and mitigate the risk of a wider regional war. While pursuing diplomatic efforts to de-escalate conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon, Biden emphasized the importance of reaching a deal that would lead to a ceasefire, the release of hostages, and greater regional stability. He stated, 'It’s time for these agreements to be finalized, the threats to Israel to be removed, and for the Middle East to move towards greater peace and security.'The post Biden Calls Nasrallah’s Death a 'Measure of Justice,' Reaffirms US Support for Israel first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/biden-calls-nasrallahs-death-measure-justic/	2024-09-28T23:55:43-07:00

Iranian Revolutionary Guard General Killed in Israeli Strike Alon...	Iranian media reported on Saturday that a senior general in Iran's Revolutionary Guard, Gen. Abbas Nilforushan, was killed in the same Israeli airstrike that also claimed the life of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut's southern suburbs. This marks a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict as Nilforushan's death adds to the pressure on Iran to respond. His death comes as the conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza risks spreading into a broader regional war. According to Iranian sources, Nilforushan, who was 58 years old, was killed during the strike on Friday. The Tehran Times confirmed the news, and Ahmad Reza Pour Khaghan, Iran’s judiciary deputy head, also acknowledged his death, describing him as a 'guest' of the Lebanese people. Khaghan further mentioned that Iran reserves the right to retaliate under international law. Nilforushan had held a prominent role as the deputy commander for operations in the Revolutionary Guard and had been sanctioned by the U.S. in 2022 for his involvement in suppressing protests in Iran. He also played a significant role in supporting Syria's President Bashar Assad during Syria's civil war and had a long military career dating back to the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. Nilforushan was also noted to have been a close associate of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the commander of Iran’s Quds Force, who was killed by a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad in 2020.The post Iranian Revolutionary Guard General Killed in Israeli Strike Alongside Nasrallah first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/revolutionary-guard-general-killed-alongside-nasrallah/	2024-09-28T23:34:52-07:00

Middle East Erupts in Response to Nasrallah’s Assassination	Middle Eastern nations and Hezbollah's allies within the Tehran-backed 'Axis of Resistance' responded on Saturday following the confirmed death of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, killed in Israeli airstrikes. Israeli military officials announced that Nasrallah, who had led Hezbollah for over 30 years, was killed in an attack on the group’s headquarters in southern Beirut on Friday night. Hours later, Hezbollah officially confirmed the death. Hezbollah The group released a statement confirming Nasrallah's death, stating he had 'joined his immortal martyr comrades whom he had led for about 30 years.' They reported that Nasrallah was killed along with several other members of the organization during the Israeli strike on Beirut's southern suburbs. Israel Israel's military described Nasrallah as one of its 'greatest enemies.' Military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari remarked, 'His elimination makes the world a safer place,' while noting that other senior Hezbollah leaders would still be targeted. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz declared Nasrallah’s death as one of the most justified acts of counterterrorism, calling it well-deserved. Iran Iran, Hezbollah’s primary supporter and financier, pledged that the direction Nasrallah had set for the group would continue. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanani said that Nasrallah’s mission of liberating Jerusalem would be pursued. Iran's First Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref warned Israel’s leaders that the bloodshed, including the death of Nasrallah, would lead to their downfall. Hamas The Palestinian militant group Hamas condemned Nasrallah's killing, labeling the Israeli airstrikes on southern Beirut as 'barbaric Zionist aggression.' Hamas characterized the assassination as a cowardly act and expressed condolences to Hezbollah. Yemen's Houthis The Houthi rebels in Yemen vowed that Nasrallah’s death would only strengthen their determination to fight Israel. They declared that his martyrdom would fuel their resolve to achieve victory and defeat the Israeli enemy. Iraq Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani condemned Nasrallah's killing, calling it a crime and accusing Israel of crossing all red lines.

Hashem Safieddine Tipped as Potential Successor to Hezbollah Lead...	Sayyed Hashem Safieddine is one of the key figures within Hezbollah and is regarded as a potential successor to his cousin, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the current leader of the group. Safieddine, who shares a striking resemblance to Nasrallah, is in his late 50s or early 60s and has strong family and religious ties to Iran, Hezbollah's primary backer. Safieddine has long been a significant figure within the organization, serving on its influential Shura Council, which makes key decisions for the group. In 2017, both the United States and Saudi Arabia designated Safieddine as a 'terrorist,' with the U.S. Treasury describing him as a senior Hezbollah leader and a key figure within its executive body. Though Nasrallah's deputy, Sheikh Naim Qassem, would assume leadership upon Nasrallah's death, the Shura Council would convene to elect a new secretary-general. Safieddine, with his religious studies background from Qom, Iran, and close familial ties to influential figures such as General Qasem Soleimani—his son is married to Soleimani's daughter—makes him a strong candidate to succeed Nasrallah. Unlike Nasrallah, who has spent much of his time in hiding, Safieddine has been more visible in public, attending political and religious events openly. His calm demeanor shifts to more fiery rhetoric during moments of heightened tension, such as funerals of Hezbollah fighters killed in recent clashes with Israel. Hezbollah, founded during the Lebanese civil war with the help of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, is a major player in Lebanese politics and military activities, particularly known for its resistance to Israeli occupation in southern Lebanon, which lasted until 2000. Safieddine, with his long-standing role within Hezbollah’s leadership, is widely considered the strongest candidate to take up the leadership mantle should Nasrallah no longer lead.The post Hashem Safieddine Tipped as Potential Successor to Hezbollah Leader Nasrallah first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/safieddine-successor-hezbollah-leader-nasrallah/	2024-09-28T23:34:13-07:00	
DOJ Charges Three Iranian Operatives for Hacking Trump Campaign	The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced criminal charges on Friday, September 27, against three individuals linked to Iran for targeting Donald Trump's presidential campaign. The accused, identified as Masoud Jalili, Yaser Balaghi, and Seyyed Ali Aghamiri, are suspected to have ties to Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. The charges include conspiracy to access a protected computer, fraud, aggravated identity theft, and conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization, along with eight counts of wire fraud. According to the unsealed indictment, the trio sought to influence the U.S. presidential election by accessing confidential information from Trump's campaign. On August 10, Trump's campaign claimed it had been hacked, blaming Iranian actors. News outlets such as Politico, the New York Times, and the Washington Post were reportedly given leaked information but declined to publish it. Last week, U.S. intelligence officials disclosed that the same operatives also attempted to reach Joe Biden's campaign in June and July. They sent unsolicited emails containing excerpts of stolen material from Trump’s campaign, though there was no evidence that Biden's team responded to the messages. The campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris considered the emails to be spam or phishing attempts. Iran has denied any involvement in the U.S. elections. A statement from Iran's mission to the United Nations, quoted by CBS News, stated that 'the Islamic Republic of Iran does not engage in the internal conflicts or electoral controversies of the United States,' and firmly denied any intent or motive to interfere in the U.S. election.The post DOJ Charges Three Iranian Operatives for Hacking Trump Campaign first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/doj-charges-three-iranian-hacking-trump/	2024-09-28T05:27:21-07:00	
Breaking: Dahieh Strike Leaves 2 Dead, 76 Injured; Source Says Na...	The Health Ministry reported that two people were killed and 76 others injured in a major Israeli airstrike on Beirut’s densely populated southern suburbs on Friday. The ministry's statement indicated that 15 of the injured required hospitalization, but emphasized that the figures were preliminary. The strikes hit the Haret Hreik neighborhood, a known Hezbollah stronghold, and Israeli media suggested that the group's leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, was the intended target. However, a source close to Hezbollah, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that Nasrallah was unharmed, saying, 'Sayyed Nasrallah is fine.' Israeli media outlets, including three major television channels, reported that Nasrallah was indeed the target of the attack. The timing and magnitude of the blasts hinted that a high-ranking Hezbollah leader may have been present in the targeted buildings. In a potentially significant move, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short his trip to the United States and returned to Israel earlier than planned, foregoing his stay until the end of the Sabbath on Saturday. Netanyahu had addressed the U.N. earlier, pledging that Israel’s military campaign against Hezbollah would continue, dashing hopes for an internationally mediated cease-fire. Netanyahu was reportedly briefed on the strikes as they occurred while speaking with journalists. A military aide interrupted the briefing, prompting him to quickly conclude the discussion. Unlike previous conflicts, Israel has aggressively targeted Hezbollah's top leadership in recent days. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant's office revealed that he was in meetings with the Israeli air force chief and other senior commanders for updates on the situation. According to Israeli military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the strikes specifically targeted Hezbollah's main headquarters, which were located beneath residential buildings. Lebanon's national news agency reported that six buildings in the Haret Hreik area were reduced to rubble. The force of the explosion could be felt as far as 30 kilometers (18 miles) away, shaking homes and shattering windows. Ambulances rushed to the scene, responding to the devastation with sirens blaring.The post Breaking: Dahieh Strike Leaves 2 Dead, 76 Injured; Source Says Nasrallah is 'Fine' first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/dahieh-strike-2-dead-76-injured-nasrallah-fine/	2024-09-28T04:53:47-07:00	
Israeli Airstrikes Pound Beirut’s Southern Suburbs After Evacuati...	Israel launched multiple airstrikes on Hezbollah’s main stronghold in southern Beirut, sending massive plumes of smoke into the sky above the densely populated area. The strikes on Friday, which were heard across the Mediterranean city, caused panic in the residential neighborhood, which has been a Hezbollah stronghold for decades. These were the most intense strikes on Beirut’s suburbs since Israel shifted its military focus from Gaza to Lebanon earlier this week, targeting Hezbollah positions across the country and resulting in the deaths of hundreds. Reports from Israeli media suggested that Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah was the intended target of the first strike. However, a source close to the group stated that Nasrallah was unharmed. Nasrallah, a revered figure among his followers, has remained hidden from public view for years to avoid assassination. He is regarded as the only person in Lebanon with the authority to either wage war or broker peace. On Saturday, Israel's military announced that their strikes had killed Muhammad Ali Ismail, the commander of Hezbollah's missile unit in southern Lebanon, along with his deputy and other senior officials. The strikes felt like an earthquake, according to Ahmad Ahmad, a resident who fled the southern suburbs. Another resident, Abir Hammoud, described the fear, saying she thought the building was about to collapse. Following the initial wave of strikes, which reportedly leveled six buildings, a second round of bombing hit Hezbollah weapon storage sites, though the group denied this. Hezbollah retaliated by firing more rockets into Israel, with no immediate reports of casualties. In response to the strikes, the Israeli military warned civilians in parts of southern Beirut to evacuate before the second wave of bombings and emphasized that it would not allow Iran to transfer weapons to Hezbollah through Beirut’s airport. They also confirmed strikes on Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon, near Tyre. The violence has raised concerns of a broader conflict, with U.N. officials describing it as the deadliest period in Lebanon in a generation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to continue the fight against Hezbollah until Israel’s northern border was secure. Meanwhile, calls for a ceasefire from international leaders, including U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, have yet to yield results. Diplomatic efforts to end the war in Gaza are seen as key to curbing the fighting in Lebanon and preventing further escalation. Despite the ongoing conflict, a Gaza ceasefire remains out of reach, even after months of mediation. Hamas’ October 7 attack led to the deaths of over 1,200 people, with hostages still being held in Gaza. Israel’s military retaliation has caused more than 41,000 deaths in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to U.N.-verified reports. Amid the escalating tensions, Iran condemned the strikes on Beirut, calling them a dangerous escalation. Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian denounced the actions as a 'flagrant war crime.' Israel, in turn, warned Iran that its military reach extends across the entire Middle East, further fueling fears of regional instability.The post Israeli Airstrikes Pound Beirut’s Southern Suburbs After Evacuation Warnings first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-airstrikes-beiruts-southern-suburbs-warnings/	2024-09-28T04:53:34-07:00	
Netanyahu After Nasrallah Strike: 'Our Enemies Thought We Were a ...	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seemingly addressed the recent Israeli strike in southern Beirut, which reportedly targeted Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. Speaking at a Shabbat event before leaving New York, Netanyahu referenced a common phrase used by Nasrallah, who has often described Israel as weak, likening it to a 'spider web' destined to vanish. 'Our enemies believed we were as fragile as a spider’s web,' Netanyahu remarked, alluding to Nasrallah's repeated metaphor. 'What spider web are they talking about? We have tendons of steel — in both will and strength.' He emphasized that Israel is engaged in a fight for its survival, adding, 'This is no exaggeration. The people of Israel live, and when necessary, they strike back. Today, we struck back decisively, and we will continue doing so. Our goal is to ensure Israel’s eternity, and we are committed to Israel’s victory.' Netanyahu concluded by expressing his hope for a 'relatively quiet Shabbat.'The post Netanyahu After Nasrallah Strike: 'Our Enemies Thought We Were a Spider Web' first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/netanyahunasrallah-strike-enemies-spider-web/	2024-09-28T04:53:20-07:00	
Top EU Diplomat Regrets Failure to 'Stop' Netanyahu	EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell expressed his regret that no global power, including the United States, has been able to halt Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's military actions in both Lebanon and Gaza. According to Borrell, Netanyahu seems determined to continue the fighting, despite diplomatic efforts for a ceasefire. Borrell, speaking to journalists at the U.N. General Assembly, stated that while diplomatic pressure for a ceasefire is being applied, 'nobody seems to be able to stop Netanyahu' in either Gaza or the West Bank. Israel has had a contentious relationship with Borrell, with Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz recently accusing him of being 'antisemitic.' Borrell voiced support for a 21-day ceasefire in Lebanon, proposed by France and the United States, though Israel has rejected this, continuing its intensified strikes on Hezbollah, which have resulted in hundreds of deaths. Borrell noted Netanyahu's stance that Israel will not stop until Hezbollah is destroyed, drawing parallels to Israel's long-standing campaign against Hamas in Gaza. Borrell warned that if Netanyahu’s approach to Hezbollah mirrors that of Hamas, the conflict could extend into a prolonged war. He also reiterated the need to diversify diplomatic efforts beyond the United States, as U.S.-led attempts at securing a truce in Gaza have not succeeded. He expressed doubts that the U.S. is currently willing to restart negotiations similar to the Camp David talks of 2000, which aimed but failed to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.The post Top EU Diplomat Regrets Failure to 'Stop' Netanyahu first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/eu-diplomat-regrets-failure-stop-netanyahu/	2024-09-28T04:52:49-07:00	
Hezbollah Fires Projectiles at Northern and Central Israel	Hezbollah fired over two dozen projectiles towards Israel on Saturday morning, setting off alarms in more than 100 locations across Israel and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The Israeli military reported that a surface-to-surface missile was launched from Lebanon, landing in an open area in central Israel. Israeli media indicated that the missile fell into the sea. Fortunately, no injuries or property damage were reported, as confirmed by Israel's Fire and Rescue Services. While exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah have been ongoing since October 8, primarily concentrated around the border region, recent attacks have extended deeper into both countries. This past week, Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon have resulted in over 720 deaths, including many women and children, according to statistics from the Lebanese Health Ministry. Several individuals have also been injured in Israel during the escalating violence.The post Hezbollah Fires Projectiles at Northern and Central Israel first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-projectiles-northern-central-israel/	2024-09-28T04:52:33-07:00	
Breaking: Israeli Airstrikes Hammer Beirut Suburbs as Nasrallah’s...	Israeli fighter jets launched a series of heavy airstrikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut overnight into Saturday, reportedly targeting Hezbollah’s headquarters. Some reports claimed that one of the strikes aimed at Hezbollah's leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, although sources close to the group said he was unharmed. Israel stated it was attacking Hezbollah's command centers and weapons facilities. The strikes were some of the most intense on the group’s stronghold since the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. On Friday night, the sound of relentless shelling echoed across Beirut, and Israel issued warnings for residents in certain parts of the city to evacuate. Hundreds of families fled their homes, many seeking refuge in central Beirut or along the coast. Radwan Msallam, a Syrian refugee and father of six, described the chaos: 'We had nowhere to go. We took what we could and left.' While Israeli officials did not confirm if Nasrallah was killed, they claimed responsibility for eliminating Muhammad Ali Ismail, a commander of Hezbollah’s missile unit, along with other senior figures in the organization. Speaking at the U.N. General Assembly, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reaffirmed Israel’s commitment to fight Hezbollah until the threat to Israel’s border was fully neutralized. Hezbollah has been carrying out low-level attacks on Israel since the Hamas attack on October 7, escalating the conflict. In response, Israel has increasingly shifted its military focus from Gaza to Lebanon, where ongoing airstrikes have killed over 700 people and displaced around 118,000. The initial Israeli strike on Beirut hit Hezbollah's central headquarters, located beneath residential buildings in the Dahiyeh district, according to Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari. A source close to Hezbollah stated that six buildings were destroyed in the first wave of strikes. Lebanon’s health ministry reported that six people were killed, and 91 were injured. A second wave of attacks followed early on Saturday, targeting additional locations in the southern suburbs. Israel also carried out airstrikes in the Bekaa Valley and the city of Tyre. There has been no official confirmation of Nasrallah’s status since the airstrikes. Amid the escalating violence, Hezbollah claimed responsibility for a rocket attack on northern Israel in retaliation, stating that it was defending Lebanon and its people. Fears of a full-scale regional conflict have grown, with Israel raising the possibility of a ground invasion against Hezbollah. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged world leaders to avoid further escalation and to seek a ceasefire. In his U.N. address, Netanyahu also addressed the war in Gaza, pledging that Israel would fight Hamas until 'total victory' was achieved. Diplomats have emphasized that efforts to end the fighting in Gaza are crucial to preventing further conflict in Lebanon. Hamas' attack on Israel on October 7 resulted in the deaths of over 1,200 people, most of them civilians, according to Israeli figures. Amid growing tensions, Netanyahu issued a warning to Iran, saying that if Tehran strikes Israel, 'we will strike you.' He added that Israel’s reach extends throughout the Middle East, including Iran. Iran has condemned Israel’s actions, with its embassy in Lebanon describing the strikes as a dangerous escalation, while President Masoud Pezeshkian denounced them as 'flagrant war crimes.'The post Breaking: Israeli Airstrikes Hammer Beirut Suburbs as Nasrallah’s Fate Remains Unknown first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-airstrikes-beirut-nasrallahs-fate-unknown/	2024-09-28T04:52:21-07:00	
Israeli Army Claims Nasrallah Killed in Dahieh Strike	Israel's military reported on Saturday that Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Beirut the previous night. However, there has been no official confirmation from Hezbollah regarding his death. Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli military spokesperson, confirmed the news on the social media platform X, stating, 'Hassan Nasrallah is dead.' Another Israeli military representative, Captain David Avraham, confirmed to AFP that Nasrallah had been 'eliminated' following the airstrikes on the Lebanese capital. A source close to Hezbollah, speaking anonymously to AFP, mentioned that communication with Nasrallah had been lost since Friday evening. The source recalled that similar rumors about his death had circulated during the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, but Nasrallah had later resurfaced unharmed. Israel's military issued a statement explaining that the strikes also killed Ali Karake, identified as the commander of Hezbollah's southern front, along with other unspecified Hezbollah leaders. The statement further claimed that the attack occurred while Hezbollah's senior leadership was orchestrating terrorist operations against Israeli civilians. The statement emphasized that during his 32 years as Hezbollah's leader, Nasrallah was responsible for numerous attacks on Israeli civilians and soldiers, as well as directing terrorist activities globally. Hezbollah has been firing rockets into Israel since the October 7 attack by Hamas on southern Israel, which triggered the current conflict. Recently, Israel has escalated its operations in Lebanon, resulting in heavy bombardment that has caused over 700 deaths and displaced about 118,000 people.The post Israeli Army Claims Nasrallah Killed in Dahieh Strike first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-claims-nasrallah-killed-dahieh-strike/	2024-09-28T04:52:09-07:00	
Breaking: Hezbollah Confirms Death of Muhammad Srour	Hezbollah has announced the death of one of its commanders, Muhammad Hussein Srour, on Thursday. The group did not provide details about how he died but mentioned in a statement that Srour was killed 'on the road to Jerusalem,' a term used to describe those fighting in support of Gaza. Earlier the same day, the Israeli military claimed responsibility for an airstrike in the southern suburbs of Beirut that resulted in Srour's death. They identified him as the leader of Hezbollah’s Aerial Command. According to the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the operation to target Srour was authorized while Netanyahu was en route to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly.The post Breaking: Hezbollah Confirms Death of Muhammad Srour first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-death-muhammad-srour/	2024-09-27T00:43:22-07:00

Breaking: Israel Hid Explosives in Pagers Sold to Hezbollah, Clai...	Israel carried out sophisticated attacks against Hezbollah by secretly rigging pagers with explosives, Lebanese security officials revealed. These attacks, which targeted communications devices like pagers and walkie-talkies, resulted in at least 37 deaths and nearly 3,000 injuries, affecting many civilians. On September 17, Lebanese officials conducted controlled detonations of these weaponized pagers, which were off during the initial attack and hence did not explode. This demonstration showcased the potential devastation of the blasts on those carrying the devices. Despite Israel not openly admitting to these attacks, sources indicate that the operation was a collaboration between Mossad and the Israeli military, as hinted by Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in his praise for the security forces’ joint achievements. The explosive materials were ingeniously hidden inside the pager batteries, making them undetectable. Lebanese security sources highlighted the sophistication of the technology used, noting the explosives were discreetly integrated within the pagers' lithium batteries. Experts explained that these improvised explosive devices (IEDs) required minimal additional components due to the existing parts in the pagers, such as the power source and the casing. Modifications likely involved embedding a small explosive charge and an electronic detonator directly into the battery. Further investigations traced the pagers back to a model produced by the Taiwanese company Gold Apollo, under dubious circumstances involving shell companies and possibly involving Hungarian and Bulgarian entities, to obscure the operation's origins. Taiwanese and Hungarian authorities are investigating the supply chain links, with no conclusive evidence yet found to pinpoint the exact source or pathway of these modified pagers. Meanwhile, Hezbollah's leadership has initiated their own investigations to determine the exact sequence of events leading to the attack, vowing consequences for those responsible.The post Breaking: Israel Hid Explosives in Pagers Sold to Hezbollah, Claim Lebanese Officials first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-explosives-pagers-sold-hezbollah/	2024-09-27T00:42:00-07:00

He noted that Netanyahu had previously dismissed several peace overtures proposed by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the United Nations Security Council, and various Arab entities, according to the Mustaqbal Web news portal.

Despite Israel's stance, there is ongoing diplomacy involving the U.S., Qatar, France, and Turkey. These nations are engaged in discussions, and mediators remain hopeful about finding a resolution, the diplomat revealed to LBCI television.

Netanyahu Vows to Strike Hezbollah Until All Goals Are Met	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Thursday that Israel will persist in its aggressive operations against Hezbollah, emphasizing that the strikes will continue unabated until all objectives are met, including the secure return of northern residents to their homes. This declaration came as he arrived in New York for the U.N. General Assembly amidst efforts by the U.S. and Europe to instigate a 21-day ceasefire for peace talks. Prior to this, the Israeli military reported an operation targeting a Hezbollah drone commander in Beirut's southern suburbs. Netanyahu’s firm stance diminishes the prospects of an impending ceasefire, with Israel intensifying its military actions in Lebanon over the past week, citing direct responses to over 11 months of cross-border attacks by Hezbollah. The international community's call for a ceasefire aims to curb the severe hostilities that have already resulted in significant casualties in Lebanon and heightened the risk of a full-scale war. Israel is also considering a ground invasion to displace Hezbollah forces from proximate border areas. While Hezbollah has yet to formally respond to the ceasefire suggestion, Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati has endorsed it, highlighting the regional desire for peace. However, Hezbollah remains steadfast, conditioning any cessation of hostilities on a ceasefire in Gaza, where Israel has been engaged with Hamas for nearly a year. Amidst these tensions, Netanyahu affirmed the continuation of the Gaza operations until all military goals are achieved. His statements coincide with potential political instability within his government, as far-right coalition partners threaten withdrawal support should a ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah materialize, potentially jeopardizing his majority in parliament.The post Netanyahu Vows to Strike Hezbollah Until All Goals Are Met first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/netanyahu-strike-hezbollah-all-goals-met/	2024-09-27T00:40:57-07:00	
Britain Sends Humanitarian Aid to Civilians in Lebanon	Britain has announced it will provide $6.7 million in humanitarian aid to Lebanon, aimed at helping civilians affected by ongoing conflicts that have forced thousands to flee their homes. The aid package includes medical supplies, hygiene kits, and fuel, with the distribution of these resources to be managed by UNICEF. This support is intended to assist aid workers in addressing critical health and nutrition needs within the civilian population. In anticipation of potential escalations in the region's conflict, the UK has also prepared for the possible evacuation of British nationals. To this end, 700 military personnel, including members from the Border Force and the Foreign Office, have been stationed at a British military base in Cyprus. Additionally, an online portal and a dedicated phone line have been reactivated to help British citizens in Lebanon register their presence and receive assistance. Cyprus, located about 210 kilometers west of Beirut, previously served as a transit point for around 60,000 foreign nationals evacuated from Lebanon during the 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. Anneliese Dodds, Britain's Minister of State for Development, Women and Equalities, affirmed the UK's ongoing commitment to support the Lebanese people and encouraged British nationals to depart from Lebanon. Moreover, the British navy has positioned the RFA Mounts Bay and HMS Duncan in the eastern Mediterranean, and the Royal Air Force has aircraft and transport helicopters ready to provide additional support as necessary.The post Britain Sends Humanitarian Aid to Civilians in Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/britain-humanitarian-aid-civilians-lebanon/	2024-09-26T05:11:36-07:00	
US and Allies Push for 21-Day Ceasefire in Lebanon	On Wednesday, the United States, France, and other allies called for an urgent 21-day ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. This appeal, crafted during discussions at the U.N. General Assembly in New York, aims to halt the recent violence that has claimed over 600 lives in Lebanon. The joint statement described the ongoing conflict as intolerable and warned of the risk it poses for broader regional escalation. The call for a ceasefire seeks to create a window for diplomatic negotiations, urging all involved parties, including the governments of Israel and Lebanon, to agree to the ceasefire without delay. Despite the appeal, there was no immediate response from the Israeli or Lebanese governments or from Hezbollah. Senior U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, mentioned that while Hezbollah itself wouldn't sign the ceasefire, they anticipate that the Lebanese government would agree to it in coordination with Hezbollah. These officials also expect a positive reception from Israel, particularly when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addresses the General Assembly. This ceasefire initiative is part of broader efforts to stabilize the region, which has seen months of escalating exchanges of fire, displacing tens of thousands and stoking fears of a larger conflict. The proposal also aims to rejuvenate stalled talks for a ceasefire and hostage release between Israel and Hamas, indicating a complex intertwining of regional conflicts. The ceasefire proposal was a result of rapid diplomatic efforts led by President Joe Biden's security team, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. These efforts included securing endorsements from various global leaders and aligning international support for a pause in fighting, which could potentially lead to more permanent solutions. Notably, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot and Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati have publicly supported the ceasefire, urging quick acceptance to prevent further escalation. Conversely, Israel's U.N. Ambassador, Danny Danon, expressed a preference for a ceasefire to facilitate the return of residents near the border, emphasizing that Israel does not desire a full-scale war. The Security Council resolution that ended the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah was also reaffirmed by both Danon and Mikati. This resolution, which has not been fully implemented, includes provisions for a cessation of hostilities and the disarmament of armed groups in Lebanon, including Hezbollah. President Biden, speaking on 'The View,' mentioned that while an all-out war remains a possibility, there is also a chance for a significant diplomatic resolution that could transform the regional dynamics, underscoring his administration's commitment to finding a peaceful solution. Additionally, the U.S. has intensified its pressure on entities supporting Hezbollah through sanctions targeting illicit Iranian petroleum shipments, demonstrating the multifaceted approach the U.S. is employing to address the complex issues in the Middle East.The post US and Allies Push for 21-Day Ceasefire in Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-allies-push-21-day-ceasefire-lebanon/	2024-09-26T05:11:26-07:00	
Hezbollah Strikes Israeli Defense Complexes Near Haifa Again	On Thursday, the Israeli military reported conducting airstrikes on approximately 75 Hezbollah-associated sites in Lebanon throughout the night. These targets included the group's ammunition storage facilities and rocket launchers, as well as various other militant resources located in the Bekaa region and southern Lebanon. Simultaneously, Israel detected 45 projectiles launched from Lebanon, with some being intercepted by Israeli defenses and the others landing in unpopulated areas. Israeli aircraft continued their operations in southern Lebanon in response. Hezbollah confirmed it had attacked the Rafael military industry complexes near Haifa in northern Israel, targeting the site with multiple rockets. This attack was part of Hezbollah's ongoing campaign, which it says defends Lebanon and its people. On the previous day, Israeli airstrikes resulted in 72 fatalities across Lebanon. Breakdowns from the Lebanese ministry indicated that 38 deaths occurred in southern Lebanon, 12 in the eastern Bekaa area, and 22 across three towns both north and south of Beirut. These strikes also left nearly 400 people wounded.

Israeli Strike Kills 23 Syrian Workers Near Baalbek	On Thursday, Lebanon's state-run news agency reported that an Israeli airstrike targeted a building in northeastern Lebanon, near Baalbek in the eastern Bekaa Valley, killing 23 Syrian workers and injuring eight others. The airstrike occurred late Wednesday and impacted a region close to the Syrian border. The mayor of Younine, Ali Kassas, confirmed that the victims included 23 Syrians found in the debris, alongside four injured Syrians and four Lebanese nationals. Local official Hussein Salloum noted that the casualties primarily included women and children, and described the community's efforts to rescue survivors, which continued into Thursday morning with limited resources until additional help, such as a bulldozer, arrived. The Lebanese Red Cross and other groups, including Hezbollah's paramedic service and the Lebanese Civil Defense, were involved in recovery operations. This strike is part of a series of intense Israeli bombings targeting Hezbollah locations in Lebanon, which have also responded with rocket fire into Israel. The conflict has resulted in over 630 deaths on the Lebanese side, including a significant number of women and children, as reported by local health officials. Meanwhile, in Israel, several have been injured by shrapnel. Lebanon, home to about 6 million people, is also host to nearly 780,000 registered Syrian refugees, plus hundreds of thousands unregistered, making it the country with the highest refugee population per capita worldwide.The post Israeli Strike Kills 23 Syrian Workers Near Baalbek first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-kills-23-syrian-workers-baalbek/	2024-09-26T05:10:34-07:00

Conflicting Reports Emerge on Israel-Lebanon Ceasefire Talks	According to sources close to negotiations taking place in New York, there is significant progress toward reaching a ceasefire agreement between Lebanon and Israel, as reported by Lebanon's MTV. Meanwhile, an Arab diplomat spoke to LBCI television, stating that the Israeli representative at the U.N. had expressed strong reservations about a U.S. ceasefire proposal and confirmed that military operations in Lebanon would continue. The same diplomat mentioned that envoys interacting with Hezbollah received ambiguous responses, with Hezbollah tying any resolution to an agreement with Hamas, who has yet to approve the proposal’s language. Additionally, officials from the U.S., France, Qatar, and Egypt plan to meet soon to consider adjustments to the proposed ceasefire. In a joint statement, these nations, along with other international and regional allies, called for an immediate 21-day ceasefire along the Lebanon-Israel border to facilitate diplomatic efforts. Israeli media reported that a ceasefire could take effect within hours. Despite reports that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had instructed the military to reduce its operations in Lebanon due to the ongoing negotiations, his office later denied these claims, stating that Netanyahu had not yet responded to the ceasefire proposal. Furthermore, Qatar clarified that the negotiations for a ceasefire in Gaza are not directly linked to the international efforts for a ceasefire in Lebanon. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, known for his firm stance, declared on social media that Israel would not agree to a ceasefire and would continue its military actions against Hezbollah 'until victory' and until residents can safely return to northern Israel.The post Conflicting Reports Emerge on Israel-Lebanon Ceasefire Talks first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/conflicting-reports-israel-lebanon-talks/	2024-09-26T04:41:04-07:00	
Israel Vows to Fight Hezbollah 'Until Victory'	On Thursday, Israel firmly dismissed a proposal, primarily supported by the United States, for a 21-day ceasefire with Lebanon. Israel affirmed its commitment to continue its military actions against Hezbollah militants until it achieves victory. Israeli forces have been conducting heavy aerial attacks on Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon, resulting in numerous casualties, while Hezbollah has retaliated with rocket fire. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz stated on the social media platform X that Israel would not cease its military efforts in the north, aiming for a decisive victory and the secure return of northern residents to their homes. Shortly before this, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu clarified that he hadn't responded to the ceasefire suggestion and instructed the military to persist with their operations at full strength. This stance came as the United States, France, and other international allies called for a three-week halt to hostilities. This appeal was made during meetings held on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, stating that the ongoing conflict was detrimental to both Lebanese and Israeli interests. On the ground, the conflict showed no signs of abating. The Israeli military targeted around 75 Hezbollah positions in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley and the south, areas that have witnessed significant civilian displacement recently. An airstrike near Baalbek resulted in at least nine fatalities, and the intensity of the attacks led local residents to describe the experience as one of the worst nights of their lives. Amidst these developments, the possibility of an Israeli ground offensive looms, with Israel's military chief instructing preparations for such an operation, and the call-up of two reserve brigades for northern duties. The ongoing violence brings back painful memories of the 2006 conflict between Hezbollah and Israel, which had a devastating toll on both sides. The U.N. reports that the current Israeli bombings have displaced 90,000 people within Lebanon. Amidst these tensions, Hezbollah claimed a significant attack on what it said was an Israeli intelligence center near Tel Aviv. Meanwhile, Iran's Foreign Minister warned of a regional catastrophe and pledged support for Lebanon against further Israeli escalations. The violence has already led to significant casualties, with hundreds killed in just a few days, marking some of the deadliest days in Lebanon's recent history, rivaling the bloodshed seen during the 1975-1990 civil war. While the link between the Gaza conflict and the situation in Lebanon remains complex, Qatar, a mediator in the discussions to end the fighting in Gaza, indicated that while the negotiations are interconnected, there isn't a direct link between the two conflict areas.The post Israel Vows to Fight Hezbollah 'Until Victory' first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-vows-fight-hezbollah-until-victory/	2024-09-26T04:40:46-07:00

Qatar Denies Direct Link Between Lebanon and Gaza Truce Talks	On Thursday, Qatar, which has been facilitating negotiations in the Gaza conflict, clarified that there is no direct connection between the ceasefire discussions in Gaza and the international efforts to secure an immediate ceasefire between Hezbollah in Lebanon and Israel. However, the Qatari foreign ministry spokesperson, Majed al-Ansari, acknowledged to journalists that there is a considerable overlap in the mediation processes, given that the same key players are involved in both situations.The post Qatar Denies Direct Link Between Lebanon and Gaza Truce Talks first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/qatar-denies-link-lebanon-gaza-talks/	2024-09-26T04:40:06-07:00
