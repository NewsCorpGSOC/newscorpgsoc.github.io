Ortagus set for Lebanon visit to discuss Israel withdrawal	Morgan Ortagus, the U.S. deputy special envoy for Middle East peace, is expected to travel to Beirut this week, marking her second visit to Lebanon since assuming her role. According to local media reports, her visit will focus on Israel’s planned withdrawal from southern Lebanon on February 18. Ongoing Negotiations Over Israel’s Withdrawal Initially, Israel was supposed to withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon by January 26, as part of the ceasefire agreement brokered in November. However, the deadline was extended to February 18. Reports indicate that Israel is now requesting another extension, a move that has added further complexity to the situation. Ortagus' Previous Visit and Controversial Remarks During her previous visit last week, Ortagus expressed hope that Lebanese authorities would prevent Hezbollah from having any role in the newly formed government. She also praised Israel, stating she was grateful to the U.S. ally for what she described as defeating Hezbollah. Her comments sparked backlash in Lebanon, where many viewed them as interference in domestic affairs. The Lebanese Presidency distanced itself from her remarks, emphasizing that her views did not reflect the official position of the state. Despite her stance, Hezbollah has actively engaged in government negotiations, particularly regarding the allocation of Shiite Muslim seats, in line with Lebanon’s sectarian power-sharing system. Background on Ortagus’ Role Ortagus, a former U.S. State Department spokesperson and U.S. Navy Reserve officer, recently stepped into the role of deputy special envoy for Middle East peace in President Donald Trump’s administration. She replaced Amos Hochstein, who had played a crucial role in brokering the November 27 ceasefire, which ended over a year of hostilities, including two months of intense conflict. Ceasefire Terms and Challenges Under the original ceasefire agreement, the Lebanese military was to deploy in the south alongside U.N. peacekeeping forces (UNIFIL), while Israel gradually withdrew over a 60-day period. Additionally, Hezbollah was required to move north of the Litani River and dismantle any remaining military infrastructure in the south. Ortagus reaffirmed last week that the United States remains fully committed to the February 18 withdrawal deadline. Israel’s Request for Another Extension Despite the ceasefire terms, reports indicate that Israel is now seeking to extend its troop presence further and maintain control over five strategic border points, citing security concerns and the need for a buffer zone. However, Lebanon has firmly rejected this proposal. Instead, Lebanese officials have suggested that the U.N. peacekeeping forces (UNIFIL) or the Lebanese Army take control of these five key locations, rather than allowing an extended Israeli military presence. As negotiations continue, Ortagus' upcoming visit will likely play a key role in determining the next steps regarding Israel’s withdrawal timeline and the future of the ceasefire agreement.The post Ortagus set for Lebanon visit to discuss Israel withdrawal first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/ortagus-lebanon-visit-discuss-israel-withdrawal/	2025-02-12T05:49:08-08:00	
Trump vows US control of Gaza as Jordan’s king pushes back	U.S. President Donald Trump continues to push his controversial plan to relocate Palestinians and place a rebuilt Gaza under U.S. authority, despite opposition from Jordan’s King Abdullah II during a White House meeting. Following discussions with Trump, King Abdullah reaffirmed Jordan’s firm stance against any forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank. 'This is the unified Arab position,' Abdullah stated on social media, emphasizing that the priority should be on rebuilding Gaza without removing its people and addressing the worsening humanitarian crisis. However, he also acknowledged that Egypt is preparing a proposal on how regional states could engage with the U.S. administration on the matter. Jordan’s Offer and Trump's Response During the meeting, Abdullah appeared to make a goodwill gesture, proposing that Jordan could take in 2,000 Palestinian children with cancer who are in urgent need of medical care. Trump, seemingly caught off guard by the offer, responded by calling it 'a beautiful gesture', admitting that he had not been informed about it prior to the meeting. Trump’s Controversial Plan to 'Own' Gaza Trump shocked global leaders last week when he proposed that the United States 'take over' Gaza, promising to transform it into 'the Riviera of the Middle East'. However, his vision included the mass resettlement of Palestinians elsewhere, with no provisions for their return. Despite widespread criticism, Trump doubled down on the plan, insisting that the U.S. would hold and control Gaza. 'We don't have to buy it. We're going to have Gaza,' Trump stated. 'We're going to take it, we're going to hold it, we're going to cherish it.' However, he dismissed speculation that he would use his real estate background to develop Gaza personally, stating: 'No. I've had a great career in real estate.' Egypt’s Response and Arab Opposition Jordan is not alone in its opposition to Trump’s Gaza relocation plan. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who is expected to visit the White House later this week, has already called for rebuilding Gaza without displacing Palestinians. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry also released a statement confirming that it would soon present a 'comprehensive reconstruction vision' for Gaza that ensures Palestinians remain on their land. Trump’s Stance on Aid to Jordan and Egypt Prior to King Abdullah’s visit, Trump had threatened to cut U.S. aid to Jordan if it refused to accept Palestinian refugees. However, after the White House meeting, he softened his tone, saying: 'I don’t have to threaten that. I do believe we’re above that.' Nonetheless, analysts highlight that Jordan remains economically vulnerable to U.S. pressure, as it receives approximately $750 million in economic aid and $350 million in military assistance from Washington each year. Trump’s Stance on Hamas and Ceasefire Tensions The meeting took place amid growing concerns that the Gaza ceasefire is on the brink of collapse. On Monday, Trump warned that 'all hell' would break loose if Hamas failed to release all hostages by the weekend. While Trump expressed doubt that Hamas would comply, he downplayed any long-term impact on the peace process, stating: 'It's not going to take a long time. A bully is the weakest person, and they're bullies. Hamas is bullies.' Jordan’s Strategic Position and Risks King Abdullah’s strong rejection of forced Palestinian displacement reflects Jordan’s unique position in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. With nearly half of Jordan’s 11 million people of Palestinian origin, any mass relocation could destabilize the country. Following his meeting with Trump, Abdullah took to social media, reaffirming his commitment to Jordan’s stability and the well-being of its citizens—a clear message that he intends to resist U.S. pressure on the issue. As regional leaders prepare for upcoming talks in Riyadh, Egypt is expected to present its alternative proposal, setting the stage for further diplomatic maneuvering over the future of Gaza and its people.The post Trump vows US control of Gaza as Jordan’s king pushes back first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/trump-us-control-gaza-jordans-king-pushes-back/	2025-02-12T05:48:58-08:00	
Will Israel pull out of Lebanon by February 18?	With the February 18 deadline for Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon fast approaching, reports indicate that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has requested U.S. President Donald Trump to support an additional extension of the Israeli military’s deployment in the region. Israel Aims to Maintain a Buffer Zone According to a report by Israel’s Channel 12, Israel has proposed keeping its forces stationed at five strategic border locations, arguing that maintaining a buffer zone is necessary for security purposes. Israel has repeatedly insisted to the United States that the Lebanese Army has not fully deployed in the southern region, as required under the ceasefire agreement, and has failed to prevent Hezbollah from reorganizing. Israeli officials have warned that the militant group plans to return to the border areas as soon as Israeli troops withdraw. Ceasefire Agreement and Previous Deadline Extensions Under the original November ceasefire deal, all Israeli troops were supposed to exit southern Lebanon by January 26, with Lebanese military forces taking their place. However, just two days before the deadline, Netanyahu announced that Israel would not withdraw, citing Lebanon’s alleged failure to meet its commitments. Following this announcement, the White House confirmed that Israel and Lebanon had agreed to extend the withdrawal deadline to February 18. U.S. Insists on February 18 as a Firm Withdrawal Date Over the weekend, Morgan Ortagus, Trump’s deputy special envoy to the Middle East, visited Lebanon and Israel to assess the situation. Speaking in Lebanon on Friday, Ortagus reaffirmed that February 18 remains a firm deadline for Israeli forces to complete their withdrawal. 'February 18th will be the date for redeployment when the IDF completes its withdrawal,' she stated at Lebanon’s presidential palace in Baabda. She also emphasized that once Israeli forces depart, Lebanese Army units will immediately move in, reaffirming Washington’s commitment to ensuring the timeline is met. Lebanon’s Role in the Ceasefire Agreement As outlined in the original deal, the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) were expected to deploy in the south alongside U.N. peacekeeping forces while Israel withdrew over a 60-day period. Additionally, Hezbollah was required to relocate north of the Litani River, approximately 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the Israeli border, and dismantle any military infrastructure in the south. However, Israeli officials claim that their forces have continued to uncover Hezbollah weapons in restricted zones, further accusing the Lebanese military of failing to uphold its obligations under the agreement. Israel Requests Further Extension Until February 28 On Monday, Lebanese MP Nabil Bader revealed that Israel had formally requested a 10-day extension, seeking to maintain its troop presence in southern Lebanon until February 28. Meanwhile, Al-Jadeed TV reported that the ceasefire monitoring committee is set to meet before February 18, with Ortagus scheduled to return to Lebanon for further discussions ahead of the deadline. While Israeli Channel 12 reported that Israeli officials are hopeful that Washington will agree to another extension to prevent Hezbollah from re-establishing a foothold at the border, The Jerusalem Post contradicted this claim, stating that the U.S. has made it clear that no further extensions will be granted. Washington Reaffirms Israel's Withdrawal Timeline On Monday, a U.S. National Security Council spokesperson, Brian Hughes, told The Jerusalem Post that Israel remains committed to the existing timeline and has not formally requested an extension beyond February 18. Despite this statement, Israeli officials have acknowledged ongoing discussions with Washington as they attempt to negotiate improved security conditions on the ground.The post Will Israel pull out of Lebanon by February 18? first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/will-israel-pull-out-lebanon-february-18/	2025-02-11T10:45:31-08:00	
Gaza truce on edge as Trump warns Hamas of ‘hell’ over hostage re...	The fragile ceasefire in Gaza appeared increasingly unstable on Tuesday, following warnings from U.S. President Donald Trump and Hamas’ concerns that his remarks complicate ongoing negotiations. Since the truce began on January 19, there have been five hostage-prisoner exchanges, but recent tensions have put the agreement under strain. Trump warned that if Hamas fails to release all Israeli hostages by the weekend, the ceasefire should be canceled, and conflict should resume. 'If all of the hostages aren't returned by Saturday at noon, I would say cancel it, and all bets are off—let hell break out,' Trump stated on Monday. International Efforts to Preserve the Ceasefire Diplomatic efforts to safeguard the ceasefire have intensified, with Jordan’s King Abdullah II expected to raise the issue with Trump during a meeting in Washington later on Tuesday. Tensions have been rising for weeks, particularly after Trump proposed the forced displacement of Gaza’s two million residents. Hamas responded critically to Trump's latest statement, with senior leader Sami Abu Zuhri asserting that his remarks complicate the situation further and that the agreement must be respected by both parties. 'The language of threats has no value and only makes matters worse,' Abu Zuhri told AFP. Another senior Hamas official urged Trump to pressure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to comply with the deal instead of causing delays in aid delivery and blocking the agreement’s implementation. Meanwhile, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on Hamas to proceed with the next hostage release, urging both sides to avoid a return to full-scale conflict. Rising Fears Among Civilians in Gaza Many war-weary civilians in Gaza fear that the ceasefire will collapse, with some believing both Israeli and Hamas factions are interested in continuing the war. 'I pray that the ceasefire holds, but there are no guarantees,' said Adnan Qassem, a 60-year-old resident of Deir el-Balah. 'The people are the ones who suffer the most.' The armed wing of Hamas, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, announced that the hostage release scheduled for Saturday had been postponed, accusing Israel of failing to meet its commitments under the agreement, including delays in humanitarian aid and the killing of three Gazans over the weekend. Despite this, Hamas stated that the deal is still open, provided that Israel upholds its side of the agreement. Israel Signals Readiness to Resume Conflict Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz condemned Hamas' delay in the hostage release, calling it a 'complete violation' of the ceasefire deal. He also ordered the Israeli military (IDF) to prepare for any scenario, warning that Israel is ready to restart operations in Gaza. Meanwhile, negotiators are set to meet in Qatar to discuss the ongoing implementation of the ceasefire, but talks on a second phase of the deal—which were meant to start on day 16 of the truce—have stalled, with Israel refusing to send representatives to Doha. Trump’s Controversial Proposal for Gaza and Palestinian Displacement Netanyahu has expressed support for Trump’s idea of forcibly relocating Gazans, calling it a 'revolutionary approach.' The United Nations and legal experts have strongly condemned the proposal, arguing that it would be a clear violation of international law. Trump also suggested that U.S. allies Jordan and Egypt should take in displaced Palestinians—even hinting that he could withhold aid if they refuse. During a Fox News interview, Trump stated that Palestinians 'would not have the right to return to Gaza' and that they would be relocated permanently. 'If they have to return now, it will take years before it's even habitable,' he said. When asked if displaced Palestinians would be allowed to go back, Trump flatly rejected the idea, saying: 'No, they wouldn't, because they'll have much better housing elsewhere.' Palestinian Displacement Sparks Historic Parallels For Palestinians, Trump’s displacement proposal brings back painful memories of the Nakba ('catastrophe') in 1948, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were forcibly removed from their homes during the creation of Israel. Death Toll and Humanitarian Impact The Gaza war, which began after Hamas' October 7, 2023 attack, has devastated the region. The October 7 attack resulted in 1,211 deaths in Israel, with 251 hostages taken—of whom 73 remain in Gaza, including 35 the Israeli military says are dead. The Health Ministry in Gaza, which is run by Hamas, reports that at least 48,208 people have been killed since the war began. The United Nations considers these figures reliable. Earlier on Tuesday, Israeli officials confirmed the death of hostage Shlomo Mansour, an elderly man who had been held in Gaza. Ceasefire at a Crossroads As diplomatic talks continue, the next few days will be crucial in determining whether the ceasefire holds or if full-scale war resumes. With Trump pressuring Hamas, Israel preparing for renewed military action, and international mediators working to salvage the truce, the situation remains highly volatile.The post Gaza truce on edge as Trump warns Hamas of ‘hell’ over hostage release first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/gaza-truce-edge-trump-warns-hamas-hell/	2025-02-11T10:45:23-08:00	
Trump doubles down on Gaza control vow as ceasefire pressure grow...	New details emerging about the deteriorating condition of released hostages have intensified pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to extend the fragile ceasefire in Gaza, even as former U.S. President Donald Trump reiterated his pledge that the United States would take control of Gaza. Ceasefire Talks and Stalled Negotiations The second phase of negotiations, aimed at securing the release of more hostages and achieving a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, was set to begin on February 3. However, progress has been slow, despite Israeli forces withdrawing from a Gaza corridor on Sunday, in alignment with truce commitments. Netanyahu dispatched a delegation to Qatar, a key mediator in the conflict, but its low-level representation has fueled speculation that a major breakthrough is unlikely. Having recently returned from a meeting with Trump, Netanyahu is expected to convene security cabinet ministers on Tuesday to discuss the next steps. Trump's Controversial Proposal on Gaza Speaking on Sunday, Trump reaffirmed his intention for the U.S. to take control of Gaza, suggesting that America could oversee its rebuilding efforts and potentially delegate sections of reconstruction to Middle Eastern states. Trump claimed that Arab nations had signaled willingness to relocate displaced Palestinians and insisted that many Palestinians would prefer leaving Gaza if given an alternative. He justified this stance by stating that the only reason people wanted to return to Gaza was due to a lack of viable options elsewhere. The former president also expressed frustration over the state of released hostages, describing them as emaciated and resembling Holocaust survivors. He questioned how much longer the situation could be tolerated. Global Reactions and Arab Response The Israeli government, while not officially endorsing Trump’s remarks, has shown openness to the idea of resettling Gaza’s population, with Netanyahu calling it a 'revolutionary, creative vision.' However, Hamas, the Palestinian Authority, and much of the international community have strongly rejected this notion. Egypt has announced it will host an emergency Arab summit on February 27 to discuss the escalating crisis and potential population displacement. Saudi Arabia condemned Netanyahu’s recent statements, particularly his suggestion that Palestinians could establish their state elsewhere, arguing that such remarks were an attempt to divert attention from Israel’s actions in Gaza, which they described as ethnic cleansing. Qatar also denounced Netanyahu’s comments, labeling them provocative and a clear violation of international law. Hostage Families Call for Urgent Action Families of hostages who remain in captivity have voiced increasing desperation, urging Netanyahu’s government to extend the ceasefire and secure their release. Some of the newly freed hostages have described inhumane conditions, including being barefoot and in chains, with limited food and harsh treatment. Ella Ben Ami, whose father was released on Saturday, pleaded with the Israeli government to act quickly, saying that captivity was far worse than anyone had imagined. The father of Alon Ohel, another hostage still in Gaza, relayed accounts from released captives who said his son survives on half a pita or less per day. His mother, Idit Ohel, broke down in tears, revealing that her son had been shackled for over a year. Michael Levy, whose brother Or Levy was freed after 16 months in captivity, accused Israeli leadership of failing to act urgently, despite knowing the dire conditions hostages were enduring. Adding to the pressure, former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant admitted that the worsening conditions of the hostages had been known to Israeli intelligence for some time. Ceasefire Extension Uncertain The current ceasefire, which began on January 19, has held so far, raising hopes for a longer-term resolution after 16 months of war that has reshaped the geopolitical landscape in the Middle East. A key development in the ceasefire implementation came as Israeli forces withdrew from the 6-kilometer (4-mile) Netzarim corridor, a strategic military zone separating northern and southern Gaza. No troops remained in the area by Sunday. Following the ceasefire’s announcement, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians were permitted to cross Netzarim and return to the north of Gaza. However, the agreement remains highly fragile. On Sunday, three Palestinians were reportedly killed near Gaza City by Israeli fire. Israel’s military acknowledged firing warning shots and later claimed to have scored 'several hits.' The military also warned civilians against approaching their forces. Israeli troops remain stationed along Gaza’s borders with both Israel and Egypt, maintaining control over movements in and out of the enclave. Hamas Declares Victory Amid Uncertainty In response to Israel’s withdrawal from Netzarim, Hamas spokesperson Abdel Latif Al-Qanoua declared that the move proved the group had forced Israel to submit to its demands, calling it a defeat for Netanyahu’s goal of achieving total military victory. Despite these statements, Israel has insisted that it will not agree to a full withdrawal from Gaza unless Hamas’ military and political infrastructure is completely dismantled. Hamas, on the other hand, has refused to release the remaining hostages unless Israel completely pulls out. Exchange of Hostages and Prisoners The ceasefire’s first phase, lasting 42 days, has facilitated the gradual release of 33 Israeli hostages, taken captive during the October 7, 2023, attack, which marked the beginning of the war. In return, Israel has freed nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and allowed a significant increase in humanitarian aid to Gaza. However, Hamas has informed Israel that eight of the 33 hostages set for release are already deceased. While many Israeli citizens and hostage families are calling for the ceasefire to be extended, Netanyahu faces opposing pressures from far-right political allies, who insist that military operations must resume. Trump’s proposal for U.S. control over Gaza has added further complexity to the ongoing negotiations. Mounting Violence in the West Bank While the war in Gaza continues to dominate global attention, violence in the occupied West Bank has intensified in recent days. On Sunday, Israeli forces launched operations against Palestinian militants in the northern West Bank, particularly in the Nur Shams refugee camp, which has been a focal point of Israeli military action. The Palestinian Health Ministry reported that two women were killed, including Sundus Shalabi, an eight-month-pregnant woman, and Rahaf al-Ashqar, 21. The Israeli military later confirmed that police were investigating the shooting incident. Meanwhile, Israel’s Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, announced an expansion of military operations in the Jenin region, citing efforts to prevent Iran, a Hamas ally, from strengthening its influence in the West Bank.The post Trump doubles down on Gaza control vow as ceasefire pressure grows first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/trump-doubles-down-gaza-control-vow/	2025-02-10T08:49:36-08:00	
Arab nations condemn Netanyahu’s Palestinian state proposal on Sa...	Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations have strongly condemned comments made by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in which he appeared to suggest that a future Palestinian state could be established on Saudi land. Netanyahu’s remarks, which some Israeli media outlets interpreted as a joke, come at a time of heightened regional tensions, particularly following former U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to take control of Gaza and displace its population abroad. Arab League and Saudi Arabia Respond The Arab League’s Secretary-General, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, denounced Netanyahu’s comments on Sunday, calling them completely detached from reality and nothing more than fantasies and illusions. Meanwhile, the Saudi Foreign Ministry issued a strong statement of rejection, accusing Netanyahu of trying to divert attention from Israel’s ongoing crimes against Palestinians in Gaza. The ministry welcomed the collective condemnation expressed by brotherly Arab nations against the Israeli prime minister’s statements. Netanyahu’s Controversial Interview During a television interview on Thursday, Netanyahu was discussing potential diplomatic normalization with Saudi Arabia with right-wing Israeli journalist Yaakov Bardugo. At one point, Bardugo appeared to misspeak, saying that Riyadh had taken the position that there would be 'no progress without a Saudi state.' Netanyahu immediately corrected him, asking, 'Palestinian state?' Then, in what seemed like an offhand remark, the Israeli leader quipped, 'Unless you want the Palestinian state to be in Saudi Arabia. They (the Saudis) have plenty of territory.' He then shifted the conversation to the Abraham Accords, a series of agreements in which several Arab states normalized ties with Israel, stating that the peace process should be allowed to progress naturally. Widespread Regional Condemnation Despite Netanyahu’s tone, his suggestion that Palestinians could be resettled outside of Gaza and the West Bank sparked immediate backlash across the Arab world. Qatar, Egypt, and the Palestinian Foreign Ministry condemned the remarks, labeling them 'racist.' Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called the comments 'inflammatory' and a 'clear violation of international law,' emphasizing that Palestinians have the right to establish an independent, sovereign state. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) Foreign Ministry described Netanyahu’s statement as 'reprehensible and provocative,' branding it a blatant violation of international law and the UN Charter. For Palestinians, any attempt to forcibly remove them from Gaza brings back painful memories of what is known as the 'Nakba' (or catastrophe)—the mass displacement of Palestinians during the establishment of Israel in 1948. Saudi Arabia’s Strong Rejection In its official response, the Saudi government stated that Netanyahu’s 'extremist and occupying mentality' fails to grasp the deep significance of Palestinian land for its people. The Saudi Foreign Ministry further accused Israel of believing that Palestinians do not deserve to live, pointing to the destruction of Gaza and the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians as evidence of Israel’s lack of moral responsibility or human compassion.The post Arab nations condemn Netanyahu’s Palestinian state proposal on Saudi land first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/arab-nations-condemn-netanyahus-palestinian-state-proposal-saudi-land/	2025-02-10T08:49:28-08:00	
Meet Lebanon’s new ministers	After weeks of intense political negotiations, Prime Minister Nawaf Salam successfully formed a government on Saturday, marking the end of over two and a half years of caretaker leadership in Lebanon. Salam had previously committed to excluding political party members from ministerial positions, aiming to break away from Lebanon’s long-standing sectarian and corruption-linked political system. However, given the country's sectarian-based power-sharing structure, cabinet appointments were still made after consultations with political leaders. Key Ministers in Lebanon's New Government Finance – Yassine Jaber A former minister of economy and transport, Yassine Jaber has strong ties to Speaker Nabih Berri. Previously a lawmaker within Berri's Amal bloc, which is allied with Hezbollah, Jaber is not officially affiliated with any political party. His appointment, which had been leaked in advance, drew criticism from some who saw it as a political victory for Berri. The finance ministry has long been under the influence of Lebanon’s two dominant Shiite parties, making it a highly strategic portfolio. Jaber’s role will be particularly crucial as Lebanon seeks financial support to rebuild from years of economic collapse and the recent conflict with Israel. Environment – Tamara Elzein Tamara Elzein has served as Secretary-General of Lebanon’s National Council for Scientific Research since 2022. Additionally, she holds the position of Vice President of the Lebanese National Commission at UNESCO. She has an academic background in physical chemistry, earning her doctorate from Université de Haute-Alsace in France. Culture – Ghassan Salame An academic, diplomat, and politician, Ghassan Salame has previously held the culture minister role in Lebanon. He has served as a United Nations envoy to Libya, worked under former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, and contributed to UN missions in Iraq. Social Affairs – Haneen Sayed An economist and author, Haneen Sayed has extensive experience working with the World Bank, particularly on Lebanon’s response to its economic crisis and the war in neighboring Syria. Energy – Joe Saddi Joe Saddi, who holds an MBA from Cornell University, has a background in business consulting, particularly in privatization and deregulation. He was previously Senior Partner and Chairman of Strategy&’s Middle East division and Chairman of the Board at Booz & Company. According to his LinkedIn profile, Saddi was based in the United Arab Emirates, where he led privatization efforts in the energy, mining, and steel sectors while advising Middle Eastern governments on deregulation and policy reforms. His appointment marks the first time in years that the energy ministry has not been controlled by the Free Patriotic Movement (FPM)—a Christian party that was once a Hezbollah ally before their relationship deteriorated over conflicts with Israel. The FPM has no involvement in the current government. Minister for the Displaced, Technology, and AI – Kamal Shehadi Kamal Shehadi has been appointed as the minister for the displaced and state minister for technology and artificial intelligence—a challenging position in a country where electricity shortages persist for most of the day. Shehadi has worked extensively in the telecommunications and technology sectors. His LinkedIn profile indicates that he was previously based in the United Arab Emirates and holds degrees from Columbia University and Harvard University in the United States.The post Meet Lebanon’s new ministers first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/meet-lebanons-new-ministers/	2025-02-09T07:39:44-08:00	
Breaking: Israeli drone strike kills six near Lebanon-Syria borde...	An Israeli drone strike in Janata, near Lebanon’s eastern border with Syria, resulted in the death of six people and left two others injured on Saturday, according to Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency. The Israeli military confirmed the attack, stating that it targeted Hezbollah operatives who were operating within a strategic weapons manufacturing and storage facility belonging to the group. Since the ceasefire agreement was implemented in late November, marking the end of the most recent Israel-Hezbollah conflict, Israel has continued near-daily airstrikes on sites it claims are Hezbollah-linked throughout Lebanon. The ceasefire terms allow both Israel and Lebanon to engage in self-defense actions, though the agreement does not clearly define what constitutes self-defense. While the initial 60-day period for the ceasefire’s implementation concluded in late January, both sides agreed to extend the deadline until February 18.The post Breaking: Israeli drone strike kills six near Lebanon-Syria border first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strike-kills-six-lebanon-syria-border/	2025-02-09T07:39:33-08:00	
Hamas and Israel carry out fifth prisoner swap	Hamas conducted a public display on Saturday, parading three Israeli hostages before a gathered crowd in Gaza ahead of their official handover to the Red Cross. The three Israeli civilians were released in exchange for dozens of Palestinian detainees held by Israel as part of an ongoing ceasefire that has temporarily halted the conflict in Gaza. Unlike previous prisoner exchanges, where captives were transferred without public statements, the three hostages were brought onto a stage, where a masked Hamas fighter held a microphone as they were made to address the crowd. Meanwhile, a controversial proposal by former U.S. President Donald Trump to relocate the Palestinian population from Gaza has added further tension to negotiations. While Israel has welcomed the idea, Palestinians and most of the international community have firmly rejected it. Although the proposal has not yet impacted the current ceasefire phase, which is set to last until early March, it could complicate discussions for the next stage, in which Hamas is expected to release more hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire. The group may hesitate to free additional captives if it perceives that the U.S. and Israel are serious about depopulating Gaza, an act that human rights organizations argue would violate international law. The hostages released on Saturday were identified as 52-year-old Eli Sharabi, 56-year-old Ohad Ben Ami, and 34-year-old Or Levy. They were among those taken captive during the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, which triggered the war. Ahead of the exchange, dozens of Hamas fighters, masked and heavily armed, assembled at a designated location near Gaza’s central north-south highway. Some arrived in white pickup trucks mounted with weapons. A small group of onlookers gathered nearby, though Hamas fighters formed a line to maintain distance from a temporary stage set up at the scene. This marks the fifth prisoner exchange since the ceasefire took effect on January 19. So far, 18 Israeli hostages and over 550 Palestinian detainees have been freed under the agreement. The first phase of the ceasefire includes provisions for the release of 33 Israeli hostages in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, the return of displaced Palestinians to northern Gaza, and an increase in humanitarian aid to the devastated region. Additionally, last week saw the first instance since May where injured Palestinians were permitted to leave Gaza for medical treatment in Egypt. On Saturday, Israel released 183 Palestinian detainees, including 18 individuals serving life sentences for deadly attacks, 54 prisoners with long-term sentences, and 111 individuals from Gaza who were detained following the October 7 attack. The detainees, all men between the ages of 20 and 61, were viewed differently by both sides—while Israel considers them terrorists, many Palestinians regard them as fighters resisting Israeli occupation. Almost every Palestinian family has a relative, friend, or acquaintance who has spent time in Israeli prisons. In a previous truce in November 2023, more than 100 Israeli hostages were freed in a weeklong ceasefire. However, more than 70 remain in Gaza. Israel estimates that 34 of them were either killed during the initial attack or died while in captivity. According to Israeli sources, Hamas has confirmed that eight of the 33 individuals set for release in the first phase of the ceasefire are deceased. It remains unclear whether Israel and Hamas have entered negotiations for the second phase of the truce, which would involve the release of the remaining Israeli hostages and a potential extension of the ceasefire. If no agreement is reached, the war could resume in early March. Despite the temporary pause in hostilities, Israel maintains its commitment to dismantling Hamas, even as the militant group quickly reasserted control over Gaza following the ceasefire. Within Israeli political circles, hardline figures, including members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition, are calling for an immediate resumption of military operations once the first phase of the truce is completed. Hamas, on the other hand, has made it clear that it will not release the remaining hostages without an end to the war and a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The October 7 attack that set off the conflict resulted in the deaths of approximately 1,200 people in Israel, most of them civilians. Since then, Gaza’s Health Ministry reports that more than 47,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s retaliatory air and ground operations, with over half of the casualties being women and children. Among the 72 Palestinian detainees released on Saturday, five are from East Jerusalem, 14 from Gaza, and 53 from the occupied West Bank. Seven of them are expected to be transferred to Egypt ahead of further deportation. In the West Bank, 47 prisoners were released from Ofer Prison and transferred to Palestinian custody at the Betunia crossing near Ramallah. Families, friends, and supporters had gathered there to celebrate their return, treating them as heroes. Those freed had been imprisoned for a range of offenses, including involvement in militant activities and attacks spanning decades. One of the most notable figures among them is Iyad Abu Shakhdam, 49, who spent nearly 21 years behind bars for his role in Hamas-led attacks, including a 2004 suicide bombing on a bus in Beersheba that killed 16 people, including a four-year-old child. Also released was Jamal al-Tawil, a high-profile Hamas politician from the occupied West Bank and former mayor of al-Bireh, near Ramallah. Over the past two decades, he has been repeatedly detained by Israeli authorities. His most recent arrest, in 2021, was linked to alleged involvement in violent riots and efforts to strengthen Hamas’ influence in the West Bank. He was placed under administrative detention, a system allowing suspects to be held for six months at a time without formal charges or trial. The broader conflict traces back to Israel’s capture of the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem during the 1967 Mideast war. Palestinians seek all three territories as part of their future independent state.The post Hamas and Israel carry out fifth prisoner swap first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hamas-israel-carry-out-fifth-prisoner-swap/	2025-02-08T07:37:26-08:00	
Hezbollah’s Raad blasts US official for ‘blatant interference’	The head of Hezbollah’s parliamentary bloc, Mohammad Raad, strongly criticized remarks made by visiting U.S. official Morgan Ortagus on Friday, calling them an unacceptable interference in Lebanon’s internal affairs. Raad described Ortagus’s statement as malicious and irresponsible, arguing that it directly targeted a fundamental part of Lebanon’s political structure. He accused the U.S. of blatant interference in the country’s sovereignty, rejecting Washington’s stance on Hezbollah’s involvement in Lebanon’s next government. During her visit, Ortagus had stated that the U.S. considered Hezbollah’s participation in the government a red line. She also declared that Hezbollah had been defeated by Israel, expressing gratitude to Washington’s ally for its role in weakening the group. In response to these comments, a small group of Hezbollah supporters took to the streets in protest. Waving Hezbollah’s yellow flags, they set tires on fire, blocking access to Beirut’s international airport. Some demonstrators spray-painted the Star of David alongside the words 'USA' and 'Trump' on the road, encouraging pedestrians and vehicles to trample over them. Meanwhile, Lebanon’s presidency distanced itself from Ortagus’s statements, issuing a response on X. The statement clarified that her remarks represented her personal views and that the presidency did not endorse them. A widely circulated photo from her meeting with Lebanese President Joseph Aoun added further controversy, as it showed Ortagus shaking hands with Aoun while wearing a ring featuring the Star of David, fueling discussions on social media. Another strong reaction came from Jaafari Mufti Sheikh Ahmad Qabalan, a senior Shiite cleric and close ally of Hezbollah. In his statement, he reaffirmed Hezbollah’s role as a legitimate national and representative force in Lebanon. He dismissed claims that Hezbollah had been defeated and insisted that no power on earth could eliminate the group. Qabalan emphasized that Lebanon’s sovereignty belongs exclusively to its people and national institutions, not to external forces or what he called America’s exclusionary and destructive policies. He warned that forming a government without Hezbollah and its ally, the Amal Movement, would push Lebanon into further instability and uncertainty.The post Hezbollah’s Raad blasts US official for ‘blatant interference’ first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollahs-raad-blasts-us-official-blatant-interference/	2025-02-08T07:37:15-08:00	
Hezbollah member and daughters killed in Tayr Harfa blast	The Following is an almost completely different rendition of this story, the content having similar ideas but rephrased, and presented differently. A Hezbollah official and his two daughters were killed Friday after an explosion targeting a house belonging to the said official struck a southern border town, according to media reports from Tayr Harfa. The man, Abbas Haidar, was a known member of Hezbollah, according to LBCI. His daughters, who were also in the car at the time, were also killed while other family members were injured. Meanwhile, the Israeli air forces struck positions in the Tebna area in the southern town of Bissariyeh, near Sidon. Tuesday's attacks came after a series of airstrikes on positions in the eastern border region and Iqlim al-Tuffah before dawn, in further breaches of a ceasefire deal. The U.S. deputy special envoy for the Middle East, on a visit to Lebanon on Friday, reiterated that Washington was committed to seeing Israel withdraw from southern Lebanon by the firm deadline of February 18. He further declared that the participation of Hezbollah in the future government of Lebanon was a red line as far as the U.S. was concerned. However, the Lebanese leadership, including President Joseph Aoun, Speaker Nabih Berri, and Prime Minister-designate Nawaf Salam, have yet to agree on the formation of a new government. An uneasy truce has held between Israel and Hezbollah since November 27, after more than a year of clashes, including two months of intense warfare. Despite this, Israeli forces have continued to conduct strikes in Lebanese territory. The ceasefire agreement called for Lebanese military forces to deploy south of the Litani River, along with United Nations peacekeepers, while Israel was to withdraw its forces over a 60-day period. Hezbollah was also to pull its forces north of the Litani River and dismantle what remained of its military structure in the south. The initial deadline was to withdraw Israeli troops by January 26, but due to delays in the process, this was extended until February 18.

US envoy: Hezbollah defeated, must stay out of Lebanon’s governme...	A senior U.S. official said on Friday that Hezbollah's involvement in Lebanon's new government is a red line for Washington, while he described the Iran-backed group as 'defeated' in its conflict with Israel, in an interview during a visit to Beirut. Ortagus' visit comes as Prime Minister-designate Nawaf Salam faces ongoing challenges in forming a government amid intense political pressure from powerful factions seeking control over ministerial positions. Lebanon's political structure is based on a sectarian power-sharing model where key positions are divided among Christian, Shiite, Druze, and Sunni factions. The Shiites are dominated by the Hezbollah-Amal alliance, while Christian influence is divided between the Lebanese Forces and the FPM. All of them are trying to get their hands on a certain ministry. With Lebanon struggling to recover from a prolonged economic crisis and the destruction caused by conflict, securing international financial support has become paramount. Ortagus underscored how the United States has drawn lines in the sand: Hezbollah cannot intimidate the Lebanese people by holding a role in governance. Following a meeting with President Joseph Aoun-who long had been Washington's favored ruler of Lebanon-Ortagus repeated that Hezbollah should be excluded from political power. To that, however, the Lebanese presidency quickly responded on X that her comments reflected personal opinions and the presidency wasn't obliged toward them. Over a year of hostilities has weakened Hezbollah, paving the way for Lebanon's long-stalled parliament to finally elect Aoun as president and approve Salam as prime minister after more than two years of political deadlock. The military actions of Israel have significantly reduced Hezbollah's leadership and operational strength, including reportedly reeling in the group's longtime leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. Added to that is the loss of Syrian ally Bashar al-Assad, which has disrupted Hezbollah's supply routes of weapons. Ortagus praised Israel for its military effort, stating that Hezbollah's defeat had started and its 'reign of terror' in Lebanon and beyond was over. She said that Washington also hopes the new government will place high on its agenda anti-corruption measures, removing Hezbollah's influence, and carry out reforms to stabilize the country. It was a raft of reforms the international community had been using as leverage Lebanon must undertake to unlock much-needed financial aid following a deep economic collapse that began in 2019, which was widely blamed on corruption and mismanagement. Salam, who is trying to form a new government, announced earlier in the week that his administration would not include political party members or any individuals who plan to run in parliamentary elections. The move demonstrates the broad Lebanese view that the traditional political parties are steeped in corruption. Salam also signaled that he would not tolerate any ministers in his cabinet blocking government work. But Hezbollah and its main Shiite partner, Amal, have insisted on pre-approving any Shiite ministers who enter the cabinet, which Salam has refused. Lebanon's sectarian system of government frequently produces political deadlocks, as parties use influence to veto the formation of government. The same happened over the presidency before Aoun's eventual election, in a period when the country didn't have a president for two years. As Lebanon works through internal political disputes, the issue of the withdrawal of Israel from Lebanese territory remains atop the agenda. Salam has committed himself to enacting reforms and rebuilding the country while making sure that a U.N. resolution calling for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanese territory will be implemented. Following his talks with Ortagus, Aoun said the consultations for the finalizing a new government are almost over, adding he pressed Israel to implement the agreed upon withdrawal within the set timeframe as the Lebanese Army is ready to deploy in towns and villages, which would become clear when withdrawal takes place. The ceasefire agreement, brokered by Washington on November 27, ended more than a year of conflict including two months of fierce fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. Under the deal, the Lebanese military was to take control of the south alongside U.N. peacekeepers while Israeli forces completed their withdrawal within 60 days. At the same time, Hezbollah had to withdraw its forces north of the Litani River-about 30 kilometers from the border-and dismantle the remaining military infrastructure in the south. The initial pull-out date had been put at January 26 but was shifted back to February 18 following mutual accusations between both parties over ceasefire breaches. Certain numbers of Israeli troops still stay in some locations, but Ortagus confirmed that the U.S. commitment remains complete towards making sure a completion by the new deadline.The post US envoy: Hezbollah defeated, must stay out of Lebanon’s government first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-envoy-hezbollah-defeated-stay-out-lebanons-government/	2025-02-07T07:16:42-08:00	
Israeli defense minister orders army to plan Palestinian exodus f...	Israel has announced that it has begun preparations for the large-scale departure of Palestinians from Gaza, aligning with President Donald Trump's controversial proposal for the region. Meanwhile, Egypt has intensified diplomatic efforts behind the scenes to counter the plan. Palestinian officials, along with much of the international community, have rejected Trump's proposal, fearing it will prevent refugees from returning and further destabilize the region. Egypt has warned that such a move could jeopardize its long-standing peace treaty with Israel, which has been a pillar of stability in the Middle East and a key factor in American influence in the region. Saudi Arabia, another crucial U.S. ally, has also voiced its opposition to any mass transfer of Palestinians. The kingdom insists that normalization of relations with Israel—one of the main objectives of the Trump administration—will only happen if a Palestinian state is established, including Gaza. Palestinians have been clear that they do not want to leave. Human Rights Watch and other advocacy groups argue that implementing Trump's plan would constitute 'ethnic cleansing,' as it involves the forced displacement of a civilian population. Israeli officials, on the other hand, have framed the potential mass emigration as voluntary. Defense Minister Israel Katz stated that he has instructed the military to prepare for facilitating the departure of large numbers of Palestinians through land crossings, as well as exploring options for exit via sea and air. However, no visible signs of such preparations have been observed on the ground. Egypt's Efforts to Block the Plan Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi has not publicly addressed Trump's announcement regarding the relocation of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents and U.S. involvement in rebuilding efforts. However, Egyptian officials, speaking anonymously due to the sensitive nature of the discussions, confirmed that Cairo has strongly opposed the proposal in talks with the Trump administration and Israel. Egypt has warned that the long-standing peace agreement with Israel could be at risk if such a plan moves forward. Officials have communicated this stance to the U.S. government, including the Pentagon, State Department, and members of Congress. Additionally, Egypt has relayed its concerns to Israel and key Western European allies such as the UK, France, and Germany. A Western diplomat stationed in Cairo confirmed receiving Egypt’s message, emphasizing that the country considers the plan a direct threat to its national security. Egypt had already rejected similar proposals from the Biden administration and European nations earlier in the war, which escalated after Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel. Unlike those earlier, more private discussions, Trump publicly announced his plan alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a White House press conference. After widespread criticism from Palestinians, Arab governments, and international leaders, the Trump administration appeared to scale back the proposal. U.S. officials clarified that any relocation of Gazans would be temporary and that Trump had not committed to deploying American troops or using U.S. tax dollars to rebuild Gaza. Egyptian officials maintain that Palestinians do not need to be displaced for reconstruction efforts to proceed. They reaffirmed their commitment to establishing a Palestinian state that includes Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem—territories seized by Israel in the 1967 war. However, Israel has opposed Palestinian statehood, insisting on maintaining indefinite security control over both Gaza and the West Bank. Furthermore, Israel annexed East Jerusalem, a move unrecognized by most of the international community. Arab States Reject Forced Transfers Last week, Egypt hosted a high-level meeting with diplomats from Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates—key players in the 2020 Abraham Accords, which normalized ties between Israel and several Arab nations. The five nations collectively rejected any forced relocation of Palestinians from Gaza or the West Bank. In an editorial published on Thursday, Egypt’s state-run newspaper Al-Ahram warned that 'the independence of Arab nations, the unity of their peoples, and their territorial sovereignty are under severe threat,' underscoring the regional opposition to Trump's proposal.The post Israeli defense minister orders army to plan Palestinian exodus from Gaza first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-defense-minister-army-palestinian-exodus-gaza/	2025-02-06T03:01:11-08:00	
Watch: US backtracks as Trump’s Gaza plan triggers global outcry	The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump faced widespread backlash after his proposal to take control of Gaza sparked global condemnation, with the United Nations cautioning against what it described as 'ethnic cleansing' in the Palestinian territory. Amid criticism from Palestinian officials, Arab nations, and international leaders, Secretary of State Marco Rubio attempted to clarify the stance, stating that any relocation of Gazans would be temporary. Meanwhile, the White House stressed that there was no intention of deploying U.S. troops. Despite the controversy, Trump defended the plan, stating 'everybody loves' it during a White House press conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. His remarks drew audible gasps from those present. Providing few specifics on how the U.S. intended to remove over two million Palestinians or govern the war-ravaged enclave, Trump declared, 'The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it, too. We'll own it.' Rubio described the proposal as a 'generous move' aimed at rebuilding Gaza, rather than an act of aggression. However, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt later emphasized that the U.S. had no plans to finance Gaza's reconstruction, adding that involvement 'does not mean boots on the ground' or financial commitments from American taxpayers. The United Nations strongly criticized the idea, with Secretary-General Antonio Guterres highlighting the fundamental right of Palestinians to remain in their homeland. His spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric, stated that any forced displacement would amount to ethnic cleansing. The proposal also faced opposition from world leaders. French President Emmanuel Macron and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi deemed any forced displacement of Palestinians unacceptable, warning that such a move would violate international law and destabilize the region. Iran’s Foreign Ministry denounced the plan as a continuation of Israel’s alleged efforts to eradicate the Palestinian people. Palestinian officials and human rights organizations swiftly condemned the proposal. Hamas, which has governed Gaza since 2007, rejected the plan outright, labeling it as both 'racist' and 'aggressive.' Leavitt attempted to soften the controversy by insisting that Trump's vision involved only a 'temporary relocation' of Gazans, arguing that the area was currently 'not livable for any human being.' Amid Israel’s ongoing military campaign following Hamas’s October 2023 attack, much of Gaza has been left in ruins, with schools, hospitals, and civilian infrastructure severely damaged. Human Rights Watch accused Israel of pursuing a deliberate strategy to render Gaza uninhabitable. The organization's regional director, Lama Fakih, warned that Trump's proposal could shift the U.S. from being 'complicit in war crimes to a direct perpetrator of atrocities.' Although Trump hinted at the possibility of visiting Gaza, his remarks suggested the territory would not necessarily be restored for Palestinian resettlement. However, Leavitt later clarified that he expected Egypt, Jordan, and other nations to temporarily accept Palestinian refugees to facilitate the reconstruction of their homeland. Despite Trump's proposals, many Palestinians remained resolute in their determination to stay. 'They can do whatever they want, but we will remain steadfast in our homeland,' said Gaza resident Ahmed Halasa. Meanwhile, Netanyahu praised Trump, calling him Israel’s 'greatest friend' and commending his 'willingness to think outside the box.' In a Fox News interview, he described the proposal as 'remarkable' and 'the first good idea that I've heard.' Netanyahu also suggested that any potential relocation of Gazans would not be permanent. 'They can leave, they can then come back, they can relocate and come back, but you have to rebuild Gaza,' he stated.

Two Israeli soldiers killed in West Bank shooting	The Israeli military reported, on Tuesday, that two soldiers were killed in a shooting attack on a military checkpoint in the occupied West Bank; another six soldiers were lightly injured in an attack at a military post in Tayasir, the northern part of the region. The military said the assailant had opened fire at troops in the checkpoint. In reaction, Israeli forces opened fire back and killed the attacker. Later, Israeli medics confirmed six injured people have been taken to the hospital. They said all were soldiers and at least two were in a critical condition. Hamas and the Islamic Jihad militant group praised the attack, though neither group claimed responsibility. The shooting came amid an intensified Israeli military campaign in nearby Jenin, where security forces have been carrying out broad operations to root out what Israel says is a surge in militant activity. For weeks, armored bulldozers and soldiers have flattened scores of homes in a heavily scarred landscape. While no official toll is being released by the Palestinian health authorities, at least 20 Palestinians have been reported killed by Israeli forces since the operation started. Violence in the West Bank has spiked massively since the terror group Hamas waged its attack on October 7, 2023, from the Gaza Strip, prompting the current war.The post Two Israeli soldiers killed in West Bank shooting first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/two-israeli-soldiers-killed-west-bank-shooting/	2025-02-04T10:47:13-08:00	
Lebanon files UN complaint over Israeli ceasefire violations	The Lebanese Foreign Affairs Ministry, through the Permanent Mission in New York, charged a formal complaint against Israel regarding continued violations of the cease-fire, which condemned recurrent infringements by Israel in breach of Resolution 1701. According to the National News Agency, Lebanon has recorded Israeli military operations, including aerial and ground attacks, demolition of houses and residential areas, targeting civilians, journalists, and Lebanese army members. The complaint also underlines abduction of Lebanese nationals and attacks against those who wanted to return to their villages in southern Lebanon after the expiry of the 60-day deadline for withdrawal of Israel. Under a cease-fire agreement reached in November, Israeli forces were to withdraw over a 60-day period as the Lebanese army deployed alongside U.N. peacekeeping forces in the south. Israel did not meet the withdrawal deadline, and 24 people were killed while at least 124 others were injured as residents attempted to return to their homes. The deadline for withdrawal was extended to February 18. Lebanon has called on the U.N. Security Council and France and the U.S., which brokered the ceasefire and established a committee to oversee its enforcement, to take a decisive and clear stance to put an end to Israel's ongoing violations.The post Lebanon files UN complaint over Israeli ceasefire violations first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lebanon-un-complaint-israeli-violations/	2025-02-04T10:47:00-08:00	
Iran denies funneling cash to Hezbollah via airport	Israel has accused Iran of pumping millions of dollars to Hezbollah through Beirut's Rafik Hariri International Airport. According to the allegations, Iranian diplomats and Turkish citizens have transported suitcases full of U.S. dollars in support of Hezbollah's activities in Lebanon. In turn, Iran and Hezbollah have denied the reports outright. Hezbollah described the reports as baseless, claiming they were part of a broader campaign to tarnish the group's image and provide a pretext for targeting Lebanon's infrastructure. The Lebanese government has also denied these charges, underlining that Beirut's airport is under the tight control of the Lebanese army, which would not allow any illegal activities, including transferring money or weapons to Hezbollah. As one high-ranking Lebanese security official said, smuggling large sums of cash is already hard because of increased security, but small valuable items might get through. The accusation has come in the wake of a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. Fears in Israel have been that such Iranian financing would enable Hezbollah to rearm and consolidate a powerful position in the region. Out of those fears, the report says that Israel has issued threats to attack Beirut Airport should that airport be used in smuggling activities. Yet uneasy, all parties continue to view with keen eyes as events roll on. Still tense, the world waits and watches how all these accusations and denials could make a potentially precarious Middle East balance even further precarious.The post Iran denies funneling cash to Hezbollah via airport first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/iran-denies-funneling-cash-hezbollah-airport/	2025-02-03T07:18:22-08:00	
Breaking: Latest government line-up revealed	Both Hezbollah and the Amal Movement have retained four ministerial positions in the new government, but they had agreed on the selection of a fifth in coordination with President Joseph Aoun and Prime Minister-designate Nawaf Salam, *Nidaa al-Watan* added. The point is, that fifth minister has not yet been agreed upon, yet Hezbollah and Amal insist that their suggestions regarding the selection of that minister should be taken into account. The parties have proposed the following for the Shiite cabinet representation: Yassine Jaber for finance, Nassif Siqlawi for industry, Tamara al-Zein for the environment, and Rakan Nassereddine for health. For the fifth Shiite ministerial post, Aoun and Salam have pre­lim­i­nar­ily agreed to pro­pose Lamia Moubayed, but Hezbol­lah and Amal insist they want to have their say in that matter. For the Druze community, two ministers close to Progressive Socialist Party, Nizar al-Hani for agriculture and Fayez Rasamni for public works are present within this formation. As for Sunni ministers, a consensus has thus far been made on Rima Karami for education, Hanine al-Sayyed for social affairs, Ahmad al-Hajjar for interior and Amer al-Bsat for economy; however, all Sunni allocation options are subject to change after MP Ahmad al-Kheir's scheduled visit at Baabda. President Aoun will appoint Naji Abi Assi as the foreign affairs minister, while a retired brigadier general will be appointed to the defense ministry. The Lebanese Forces have been granted key portfolios: energy, Joe Saddi; tourism, Tony al-Rami; and telecommunications, Kamal Shehadeh. Further, *Nidaa al-Watan* reports that the LF could also obtain a fourth ministry, which would likely represent the Greek Catholic community. Other key appointments include Tarek Mitri as Deputy Prime Minister, Ghassan Salameh for culture and Adel Nassar (Justice/Kataeb Party/Maronite). The Marada Movement has nominated Ziad Ramez al-Khazen for the information ministry while the Tashnag Party has nominated Maral Toutelian for youth and sports.The post Breaking: Latest government line-up revealed first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/latest-government-line-up-revealed/	2025-02-03T07:18:13-08:00	
Israeli army fires, detains fisherman as southerners march home	For the second consecutive Sunday, residents of southern border villages gathered in what they call return marches, demanding to re-enter their towns with the support of the Lebanese Army. From the early hours, crowds converged at the western entrances of Mays al-Jabal and Houla, calling for access to their homes. Despite the Israeli army opening fire on returnees in Yaroun and deploying a drone to drop a stun grenade, no injuries were reported. However, the situation remains tense, particularly following last Sunday’s incidents, when Israeli forces killed 24 people and wounded 134 others during similar demonstrations. In Kfar Kila, residents assembled at the passage separating it from Deir Mimas, urging for its liberation despite an Israeli military operation that saw more than ten homes in the town demolished in a controlled detonation. Meanwhile, the Lebanese Army entered Aitaroun as Israeli forces withdrew, allowing residents to follow and reclaim their village. However, Israeli troops still maintain a presence on the town’s outskirts. Demonstrators also marched toward Maroun al-Ras, raising flags on trees in defiance of the Israeli army, prompting soldiers to fire shots into the air. Similarly, in Adaisseh, locals gathered at the town’s entrance despite Israeli gunfire aimed at dispersing them. Separately, an Israeli naval patrol arrested a Lebanese fisherman from the Jahir family at Ras al-Naqoura while he was fishing with his brother. His brother was later released, but the detained fisherman’s fate remains unclear.The post Israeli army fires, detains fisherman as southerners march home first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-army-fires-detains-fisherman-southerners-march-home/	2025-02-02T08:01:19-08:00	
Gaza ceasefire marks smoothest Israeli-Palestinian captive exchan...	The truce in Gaza witnessed one of its smoothest hostage-prisoner exchanges on Saturday, as Israeli captives were released in return for Palestinian detainees. Meanwhile, the crucial Rafah border crossing reopened ahead of anticipated discussions on the next, more challenging phase of the ceasefire agreement. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to meet U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Tuesday, an opportunity for him to emphasize Israel’s stance and future plans following 15 months of war. The next phase of the ceasefire aims to negotiate the release of remaining hostages and extend the truce indefinitely. If no agreement is reached, hostilities could resume in early March. Netanyahu’s office confirmed that he spoke with Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, on Saturday evening. They agreed that negotiations on the second phase would commence at their meeting on Monday, with Witkoff also planning discussions later in the week with mediators from Qatar and Egypt. As part of the latest exchange, Hamas released three male captives, while Israel freed 183 Palestinian prisoners. Another exchange is expected next Saturday. The hostages—Argentinian-Israeli Yarden Bibas, French-Israeli Ofer Kalderon, and American-Israeli Keith Siegel—were handed over to Red Cross officials at different locations in Gaza. Their release follows the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, which sparked the war. With these latest releases, 18 captives have now been freed since the ceasefire took effect on January 19. Unlike previous releases, which saw chaotic scenes, Saturday’s exchange was more structured, with armed Hamas militants forming orderly lines as the captives were escorted onto a stage to wave to the crowd. The militant group has attempted to project control in Gaza despite the loss of key military leaders. Shortly after the exchange, a bus carrying more than two dozen Palestinian prisoners departed from Ofer Military Prison for the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The prisoners were met with celebrations, as crowds lifted them onto their shoulders in triumph. Some of those released appeared frail and visibly affected by their time in detention. According to Israel’s Prison Authority, all 183 Palestinian detainees set for release have now been freed. Among them, 111 had been detained after Hamas’ October 7 attack but were not directly involved in it. These individuals, held without trial, were sent to Gaza. Seven others, serving life sentences, were transferred to Egypt. Emotional Reunions and Lingering Uncertainty Siegel, a 65-year-old originally from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, had been taken hostage from Kibbutz Kfar Aza, along with his wife Aviva, who was freed during a previous ceasefire. Members of his kibbutz expressed relief and joy upon his release. His niece, Tal Wax, noted, 'He’s lost a lot of weight, but he’s walking, talking, and he’s still himself. One of the first things he said was that he’s still vegan.' The release of 35-year-old Bibas brought renewed focus on the fate of his wife, Shiri, and their two sons, Ariel and Kfir, who were 4 years old and 9 months old at the time of their capture from Kibbutz Nir Oz. Kfir, the youngest of the approximately 250 people abducted, became a symbol of Israeli anger and helplessness. Hamas has claimed that Shiri and her sons were killed in an Israeli airstrike, but Israel has yet to confirm this. Israeli officials have expressed grave concern over their fate. Upon reuniting with his family, Bibas closed his eyes as his father, Eli, and sister, Ofri, embraced him in tears. His father whispered, 'Sweetheart.' The Bibas family later released a statement saying, 'A quarter of our heart has returned to us.' Kalderon, 54, who was also taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz, was reunited with his children, Erez and Sahar, who had been released in a previous ceasefire. 'I am here. I didn’t give up,' Kalderon told them as they embraced. The Palestinian detainees released also shared emotional moments with their families. Some expressed mixed feelings of sadness and joy, knowing that many of their fellow detainees remain behind bars. Mohammad Kaskus, who had been serving a 25-year sentence for attacks against Israelis, remarked, 'It’s an indescribable feeling, but we cannot forget our brothers still imprisoned.' For Yaser Abu Hamad, arrested in 2006 for his involvement with the Islamic Jihad militant group, the return home was bittersweet. He discovered that 20 of his family members, including his mother and sisters, had been killed in Israeli airstrikes. His first act after release was visiting their graves. Several former detainees described experiencing harsh conditions in Israeli prisons, including physical abuse. The Israeli Prison Authority has not responded to these allegations. A Temporary Respite for Gaza The ceasefire, now two weeks old, has facilitated the entry of hundreds of aid trucks into Gaza and allowed many Palestinians to return to their devastated homes in the northern part of the enclave. In a further sign of de-escalation, 50 sick and wounded Palestinian children were granted permission to leave Gaza for medical treatment through the Rafah border crossing into Egypt. This marked the first time the crossing had been opened since Israel took control of it nine months ago. During the initial six-week phase of the ceasefire, 33 Israeli captives are set to be exchanged for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israel has confirmed that Hamas provided information indicating that eight of those hostages are dead. About 80 captives remain in Gaza. Naama Weinberg, cousin of deceased captive Itay Svirsky, addressed both sides of the conflict at a weekly gathering in Tel Aviv, saying, 'We will not allow you to blow up this deal. We will not allow you to force us back into war or to sentence the captives left behind to death.' The Road Ahead: More Talks, Uncertain Outcomes Despite the temporary ceasefire, Israel remains committed to dismantling Hamas, while the militant group insists it will not release the remaining hostages without an end to the war and a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The initial October 7 attack, which ignited the war, reportedly resulted in around 1,200 deaths in southern Israel. Since then, Israel’s air and ground offensive has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, including a significant number of women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The Israeli military claims it has killed over 17,000 militants, though it has not provided evidence for this figure. Israel continues to blame Hamas for civilian casualties, arguing that the group operates from within residential areas. As negotiations for the next phase of the ceasefire loom, both sides remain deeply entrenched in their positions. If a new agreement is not reached, hostilities could resume by early March.The post Gaza ceasefire marks smoothest Israeli-Palestinian captive exchange yet first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/gaza-ceasefire-smoothest-israeli-palestinian-exchange-yet/	2025-02-02T08:01:13-08:00	
Two hostages freed, return to Israel after Gaza handover	The ongoing ceasefire in Gaza has allowed for the release of hostages, with two Israeli captives arriving back in Israel on Saturday after being handed over by Hamas to the Red Cross. This marks the fourth exchange of hostages under the truce agreement, with dozens of Palestinian prisoners expected to be freed from Israeli detention in return. The ceasefire, which began on January 19, has temporarily paused hostilities in the deadliest conflict between Israel and Hamas. The truce has not only halted fighting but has also facilitated increased humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza. Among those released were 35-year-old Yarden Bibas and 54-year-old French-Israeli Ofer Kalderon, both of whom were abducted during the Hamas-led incursion into Israel on October 7, 2023. After their release, they were transported to a military reception center, where groups of supporters lined the roads waving Israeli flags. Their handover was conducted in Khan Younis, where Hamas militants oversaw the transfer in an orderly manner, a stark contrast to the chaotic scene of a previous hostage release that had angered Israeli officials. Another captive, 65-year-old American-Israeli Keith Siegel, is also set to be released later, with arrangements in place for his transfer in Gaza City. Under the ceasefire's initial six-week phase, 33 Israeli hostages are scheduled for release in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. However, Israeli authorities report that Hamas has informed them that eight of those hostages were either killed during the October 7 attack or have died in captivity. The agreement also includes provisions for the evacuation of wounded Palestinians. On Saturday, several injured civilians were expected to cross into Egypt through the Rafah border, which had been closed by Israel in May. A European Union mission had arrived the day before to prepare for the crossing’s reopening. The first phase of the truce also aims to facilitate the return of displaced Palestinians to northern Gaza and expand humanitarian assistance to the war-ravaged region. According to Gaza’s Health Ministry, 50 sick and wounded children, along with 61 accompanying family members, were scheduled to leave through Rafah. In Israel, Bibas' release has renewed focus on the fate of his wife, Shiri, and their two young sons, all of whom were taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the October attack. A widely circulated video showed Shiri carrying their red-haired children—four-year-old Ariel and nine-month-old Kfir—wrapped in a blanket as they were taken captive. Kfir was the youngest of approximately 250 people abducted that day, and his situation has become a symbol of Israeli distress over the hostage crisis. Hamas has claimed that Shiri and her sons were killed in an Israeli airstrike, though Israeli officials have not confirmed this. However, a military spokesperson recently acknowledged that their fate remains uncertain. Bibas was reportedly held separately from his family, and images from his abduction suggest he was injured at the time. Kalderon, who was also taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz, was welcomed home by his family in Kfar Saba, north of Tel Aviv. His children, Erez and Sahar, who were abducted alongside him, had been freed in an earlier ceasefire in November 2023. Their relatives expressed relief at their reunion, with one family member stating, 'We will soon be whole again.' Keith Siegel, originally from North Carolina, was taken hostage from Kibbutz Kfar Aza along with his wife, Aviva, who was freed in November. Since then, she has led an active campaign advocating for the release of remaining captives, including her husband. Meanwhile, Israel plans to release dozens of Palestinian prisoners as part of Saturday’s exchange, including individuals serving extended or life sentences. During a previous ceasefire in November 2023, over 100 hostages were freed, but around 80 remain in Gaza, with Israeli officials estimating that at least a third of them are no longer alive. Hamas has confirmed that eight of the 33 hostages scheduled for release in this phase are deceased. Negotiations are set to begin next week for a second phase of the truce, which aims to secure the release of remaining hostages and possibly extend the ceasefire. However, if no agreement is reached, hostilities could resume by early March. Israel maintains that it remains committed to dismantling Hamas, even as the group has reasserted its control over Gaza following the truce. Some members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition, particularly from far-right factions, are pushing for an immediate resumption of military operations. Hamas, on the other hand, insists it will not release additional hostages unless there is a complete cessation of the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The war erupted on October 7 when Hamas launched an unprecedented attack that killed approximately 1,200 people, mostly civilians. In response, Israel’s military campaign has resulted in the deaths of over 47,000 Palestinians, with more than half being women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. While the Israeli military claims to have eliminated over 17,000 Hamas fighters, it has not provided independent verification of these figures. Israeli officials also attribute the high civilian death toll to Hamas' practice of operating within densely populated areas.The post Two hostages freed, return to Israel after Gaza handover first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/two-hostages-freed-return-israel-gaza-handover/	2025-02-01T10:29:24-08:00	
US claims killing senior al-Qaeda operative in Syria strike	The U.S. military confirmed that a senior operative from Al-Qaeda’s Syria branch was killed in an airstrike on northwestern Syria on Thursday. The targeted strike took place in an area that was once controlled by interim president Ahmad al-Sharaa’s group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), before it led the offensive that resulted in the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in December. According to a statement from U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), the operation successfully eliminated Mohammad Salah al-Zabir, a high-ranking figure within Hourras al-Din, an Al-Qaeda affiliate. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, reported that Zabir was traveling along the Sarmada-Idlib road when his vehicle was struck by a U.S. drone. This attack came just days after Hourras al-Din announced its dissolution, a move that was reportedly taken in compliance with orders from the interim leadership. The Observatory noted that the group disbanded to avoid direct confrontation with HTS, which had previously been Al-Qaeda’s Syrian affiliate until it severed ties with the global jihadist network in 2016. Hourras al-Din was founded in February 2018, according to the U.S.-based SITE Intelligence Group, but it only officially acknowledged its ties to Al-Qaeda in its recent dissolution statement. The United States designated Hourras al-Din as a terrorist organization in 2019 and had previously offered financial rewards for information on its key members. Over the past year, Washington conducted multiple airstrikes against the group’s leadership in northwestern Syria, including targeted operations in August and September. Despite continuing to classify HTS as a terrorist organization, the U.S. has eased some of its sanctions on the group following its role in toppling Assad’s government.The post US claims killing senior al-Qaeda operative in Syria strike first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-killing-al-qaeda-operative-syria-strike/	2025-02-01T10:29:09-08:00	
Hochstein’s successor visits Lebanon, demands inspection of 30 ‘H...	Arriving in Lebanon Thursday for her maiden visit as the new U.S. Deputy Special Envoy for the Middle East, replacing Amos Hochstein, was Morgan Ortagus. Ortagus commenced a tour of inspections with a visit to the US Embassy, where she received from US Major General Jasper Jeffers, chairman of the ceasefire monitoring committee, briefings about what the committee's missions were observing on the field. The pro-Hezbollah newspaper Al-Akhbar quoted sources as saying that Ortagus and Jeffers agreed on the start of a serious program of cooperation with the Lebanese Army. It will cover inspections of some 30 suspected Hezbollah sites north of the Litani River, notably in the al-Zahrani and Bekaa regions. The Lebanese Army Command reportedly was informed that the intelligence shows Hezbollah is hiding weapons and ammunition in buildings, storage facilities, valleys, and forests—claims allegedly based on information provided by Israel. Al-Akhbar further reported that U.S. officials are demanding the appointments of specific individuals to Lebanon's military and security apparatuses. They are seeking to see individuals at key junctures who will support their interpretation of the ceasefire agreement and have no links to Hezbollah. The sources that the newspaper cited, claimed that Ortagus would put pressure on Lebanese heads for the approval of these appointments. Washington, in coordination with France, is reportedly seeking officers to its liking with the aim of preventing further local uprisings and facilitating the Lebanese Army's deployment in the affected areas.

Geagea insists all parties join government, rejects finance for S...	In a press meeting on Friday, the Lebanese Forces leader, Samir Geagea, was keen to underline the dividing line between responsible political parties and those acting irresponsibly. He believed that all political parties should not be regarded as equal, and doing so would definitely nullify the very meaning of political governance. Geagea commented on an ongoing debate going on, with whether the newly appointed Prime Minister Nawaf Salam should name political parties through the new government. He definitely rejected the proposals to exclude all parties from this government, ensuring most of the political systems on earth were supported by parties which could not be omitted in governance even as no one political faction ever had exclusive privilege over any designated ministerial heading. He also renounced the principle of a common criterion for all, stating that it was not appropriate to put the ones who dragged Lebanon into conflict on par with others. As for the role of the Shiite Duo in the government, Geagea went on to explain that he does not object to allocating the finance ministry to a Shiite figure, but this should not be given to a representative of Hezbollah or the Amal Movement. He concluded by emphasizing that the country needs an efficient and active government-one that works to serve the aspirations of the Lebanese people.The post Geagea insists all parties join government, rejects finance for Shiite Duo first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/geagea-all-parties-join-government-rejects-finance-shiite-duo/	2025-01-31T09:20:20-08:00	
Ex-al Qaeda member appointed Syria’s transitional president	Ahmad al-Sharaa, previously known as Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, is now going to take over the presidency of Syria in what is an unexpected new chapter for the country. He has been propelled into leadership after a protracted war that saw the demise of Bashar al-Assad's regime, who ruled for decades. The statement was given by Hassan Abdel Ghani, the spokesman for the Syria Military Operations Command, who said Al-Sharaa would be head of state during the transitional period. He will represent Syria in international forums and will oversee the restructuring of the nation. Among his first tasks is to form a temporary legislative council to serve until a permanent constitution is drafted and implemented. The new command has introduced several measures as part of the transition that include suspending Syria's constitution, dissolving parliament, and disbanding the former regime's military forces and the ruling Baath Party. Al-Sharaa's leadership is the result of his role in leading the main militant group that played a central part in the offensive that ultimately led to Assad's downfall. But the task he must now accomplish is to rebuild a country that has been torn apart by over a decade of conflict. A 2011 uprising during the protests of the Arab Spring turned into an all-out war; regional and global powers, including Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United States, and Russia, ended up involved. The instability also provided an opportunity for extremist groups like ISIS to establish a presence in the country. Before his appointment, Al-Sharaa, to his credit, did acknowledge that the former regime left huge challenges, including what he termed deep societal, economic, and political wounds. He had said rebuilding Syria would require wisdom, dedication, and relentless struggle. He even showed nationalistic duty, indicating that just like his forces were fighting to liberate their country, so equally were they committed to rebuilding it. Who is Ahmad al-Sharaa? Ahmad al-Sharaa comes from a background of militancy. In his early twenties, he traveled to Iraq as a foreign fighter to fight against the U.S. invasion in 2003. At the time, he was captured and transferred to Camp Bucca, a U.S.-run prison in Iraq where many future leaders of extremist groups were held, including members of what would become ISIS. He was released and took up arms against the Assad regime, starting a long career as an armed opposition figure. Backed initially by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who would later lead ISIS, he then formed Jabhat al-Nusra, or The Victory Front, an armed group whose allegiance lay with al-Qaeda. In 2016, he broke ties with al-Qaeda, rebranding his group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, and turning away from global jihad toward governance. Unlike the ideology of al-Qaeda, which advocated for a holy war across the globe, HTS focused on running territories in Syria, especially in Idlib province, where it provided primary services to millions. According to analysts, such as Aaron Zelin, a terrorism scholar who studied HTS in depth, the group tried to establish itself as a political authority rather than purely a militant organization. As appointed transition president of Syria, Al-Sharaa's challenge is that he will have to steer the country out of the ruins of war, the divisions in its midst, and into discussions with the international community on its future.The post Ex-al Qaeda member appointed Syria’s transitional president first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/ex-al-qaeda-member-syrias-transitional-president/	2025-01-30T01:32:50-08:00	
Israel confirms release of three Israeli, five Thai hostages in G...	The Israeli Prime Minister's Office has released a statement confirming the names of three Israeli hostages set to be freed from Gaza on Thursday. The release also mentioned that five Thai hostages are scheduled to be freed, although it did not release their names. These include hostages Arbel Yehoud, 29, Agam Berger, 19, and Gadi Moses, 80, among others. In addition to the release, the Israeli authorities also freed 110 Palestinian prisoners in the latest prisoner swap. Of these, 32 received life imprisonment, and another 30 are children, Hamas said. This is part of an initial phase in a ceasefire and hostage release agreement between Israel and Hamas that had originally envisioned the release of 33 Israeli captives. There have been two previous rounds of releases, with nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners to be freed by Israel under this first phase. Israeli government spokesman David Mencer said eight of the remaining hostages Israel was supposed to receive on Thursday were known to have died. The three identified for release on Thursday are thought to be alive, the Hostage and Missing Families Forum said. Yehoud, meanwhile, had been abducted with her partner from the Nir Oz kibbutz. Also from Nir Oz - which with a population of around 400 has lost or had taken prisoner over a quarter of its population since October 7 - came Moses, described as a retired grandfather and an agronomist. The chairwoman of Kibbutz Nir Oz, Osnat Peri, termed the imminent release an historic moment but asserted that the struggle was far from over. Of the 76 people kidnapped from their community, 29 remain in Gaza. She underscored that while the road to complete rehabilitation will be long, efforts at bringing all the people home will continue. Moses’ family expressed their joy at his expected return, thanking the Israeli public for their support. Meanwhile, Berger, a soldier, was taken from a military base near the Nahal Oz kibbutz. The Hostage Forum reiterated its commitment to ensuring that every hostage, both living and deceased, is returned home. Former Hostage Expresses Gratitude to Israeli Soldier The latest news of hostage releases comes after a former captive, Amit Soussana, gave an emotional thank-you to a fellow hostage, Liri Albag, for saving her life. Soussana, who was released during a short-lived ceasefire in November 2023, gave an emotional television interview in which she said Albag, 19, had convinced one of their captors not to kill her. In the first weeks of her captivity, Soussana was in solitary confinement, in which time, she said, her kidnapper raped her. In late October, when Israel launched a ground offensive, she was transferred to another location in Gaza, where she found four other hostages, among them Albag. She said the hostages quickly banded together and pegged one of their kidnappers as significantly more dangerous than the others. That man, whom Soussana described as a 'psychopath,' beat her mercilessly at one point, binding her hands and feet to sticks and hanging her upside down. Her kidnappers, mistakenly believing her to be an officer in the IDF, interrogated her in hopes of gleaning information. At one point, she was threatened at gunpoint, while other hostages were brought in in hopes of persuading her to confess. Albag, who seemed to hold some influence over their kidnapper, reassured Soussana that he was probably bluffing. But she asked Soussana if she wanted to leave a final message for her family. Soussana instantly understood that Albag was the only one who could communicate with their kidnapper and asked her to make it clear she was a civilian. She said Albag was 'a force' and one of the few people who had an exceptional capability to stand up to their kidnapper. After two weeks in their company, the women were separated, and Soussana was transferred to Hamas's underground tunnel network; many hostages had to stay imprisoned for more than 15 months.The post Israel confirms release of three Israeli, five Thai hostages in Gaza on Thursday first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-confirms-release-israeli-thai-hostages-gaza/	2025-01-30T01:32:34-08:00
