Bassil Threatens Geagea Support If Hezbollah Backs Aoun	Jebran Bassil, the leader of the Free Patriotic Movement, has issued a warning to Hezbollah regarding its support for Army Chief Joseph Aoun in the presidential race, according to reports from local media outlet al-Jadeed. Bassil reportedly informed both Hezbollah and the Amal Movement that he would back Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea for the presidency, but only if they agree to support Aoun. Geagea had previously suggested he might run for president if he could garner sufficient political backing. Bassil, in an interview with al-Joumhouria, expressed his belief that Geagea has strong Christian support, making him a legitimate presidential candidate, and he would be willing to endorse him if he could help unite the Lebanese people. Bassil also mentioned he preferred Geagea over both Aoun and Hezbollah’s candidate, Marada leader Suleiman Franjieh. In an effort to end the political deadlock, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri has called for a parliamentary session on January 9 to elect a president. This move aims to break the two-year stalemate and revive Lebanon's struggling state institutions. It is reported that delegations from France, Saudi Arabia, and the United States, who are visiting Lebanon this week, will advocate for Aoun’s election. Lebanon has been without a president since Michel Aoun's term expired in October 2022. However, the two main political factions—Hezbollah and its opponents—have been unable to secure a majority or reach an agreement on a candidate. While Aoun is known to have good relationships with a range of political groups, including Hezbollah, he faces criticism from Hezbollah and its allies due to his ties with the United States, Lebanon’s key financial backer for the army. Aoun recently visited Saudi Arabia at the invitation of the Saudi King, and the presidential issue was reportedly discussed during the meetings. The United States, France, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt have all been working together for several months to help facilitate the election of a new Lebanese president.The post Bassil Threatens Geagea Support If Hezbollah Backs Aoun first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/bassil-threatens-geagea-support-hezbollah-aoun/	2025-01-02T06:35:34-08:00	
Israel Warns of Escalated Gaza Strikes	Israel has warned that it will increase its airstrikes on Gaza if Hamas continues to launch rocket attacks. On the first day of the New Year, Palestinian rescuers reported numerous casualties from Israeli strikes, which have been focused on northern Gaza where the Israeli military is conducting a major operation. Despite the recent rocket fire from Palestinian militants, which has been less frequent and less damaging than earlier in the conflict, it remains a political challenge for Israel, especially after nearly 15 months of fighting. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz issued a stern warning, stating that Hamas would face intensified strikes if it does not allow the release of Israeli hostages or stop targeting Israeli communities. As of now, Hamas still holds 96 hostages taken during their October 7, 2023 attack, and negotiations for their release or a ceasefire have not succeeded. Israeli military operations have continued across Gaza, with one recent strike in the town of Jabalia killing 15 people and injuring more than 20, according to Gaza's civil defense. The military claims it targeted Hamas militants in the area. The operations in northern Gaza, including the bombing of Jabalia and its refugee camp, are part of an effort to prevent Hamas from regrouping. However, the United Nations has raised concerns that the ongoing siege could lead to the permanent displacement of Gaza's population, potentially setting the stage for Gaza's annexation. The human toll of the conflict is severe, with entire families affected by the violence. A relative of victims in Jabalia described the strike as a massacre, with civilians, including children and women, killed while they slept. Many Gaza residents are now living in fear, not only due to the bombings but also the harsh winter conditions. Some have been unable to sleep for days due to the risk of illness or further missile strikes. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza is escalating, with ongoing reports of civilian casualties from Israeli bombings. UN aid officials describe widespread destruction and despair, as many people struggle to survive without adequate shelter or medical care. The Israeli military has also faced criticism for its claims that Hamas uses hospitals as military bases, an accusation that Hamas denies. As the conflict continues, the death toll in Gaza has reached at least 45,553 people, mostly civilians, while 1,208 people have been killed in Israel, according to official figures from both sides.The post Israel Warns of Escalated Gaza Strikes first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-warns-escalated-gaza-strikes/	2025-01-02T06:35:23-08:00	
Syrian Forces Sweep Homs in Major Security Operation	Syrian security forces are currently carrying out a large-scale operation in Homs city, according to state media reports. The operation, which is focused on two districts predominantly inhabited by the Alawite minority, follows an announcement from the Ministry of Interior and the Military Operations Department. The target of the operation is individuals involved in criminal activities who have refused to surrender their weapons and join settlement centers. The authorities are also searching for hidden arms and ammunition. A security official quoted by state news agency SANA stated that the operation is aimed at war criminals and those who have been involved in crimes. The operation follows earlier reports suggesting that remnants of Assad’s militias remain in parts of Homs, prompting the authorities to intensify their efforts. Since the overthrow of President Bashar al-Assad by Islamist-led rebels last month, a transitional government has been registering former soldiers and conscripts, asking them to relinquish their arms. Troops and armored forces have been deployed to search for individuals refusing to comply, particularly in Homs. A curfew has also been imposed in some parts of the city, and the Ministry of Interior has advised residents of certain neighborhoods to stay indoors and cooperate with security forces. A resident of one of the affected districts, Akrama, fled the area and reported heavy gunfire and the presence of military tanks. He mentioned that communications had been cut off, and there were reports of house searches and arrests of young men. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, stated that the two targeted districts, Wadi al-Dhahab and Akrama, are majority-Alawite, the sect to which the Assad family belongs. The ongoing operation is believed to be targeting former Shabiha militia members and individuals who were involved in pro-Assad demonstrations, which the new government viewed as a threat to its authority. Concerns over sectarian tensions have been raised, especially after protests broke out in Syria on December 25 following a video showing an attack on an Alawite shrine in the north. Although the ministry has stated that the video is old, activists have criticized the security sweeps, warning against actions that could exacerbate sectarian divisions and violate people's rights. Alawites, who have long been associated with the Assad regime, fear backlash due to their community's ties to the former president. The new leadership in Syria has sought to reassure minorities that they will be protected. However, tensions remain high, as evidenced by recent clashes in the Alawite-majority province of Tartus, where several security personnel were killed.The post Syrian Forces Sweep Homs in Major Security Operation first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/syrian-forces-sweep-homs-security-operation/	2025-01-02T06:35:12-08:00	
French Ministers Hold Talks with Berri in Ain el-Tineh	On Thursday, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri held a meeting with France's Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, who had arrived in Lebanon on Monday. Barrot's visit follows a fragile truce that has been in place since late November, bringing an end to the intense conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. During his visit, Barrot, along with French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu, met with Lebanon's army chief, Joseph Aoun, on Monday. The French officials also visited U.N. peacekeepers stationed near the Israeli border in southern Lebanon on Tuesday. The discussions focused on enhancing cooperation between the Lebanese and French military forces, as well as continuing support for the Lebanese army under the current circumstances. Lecornu announced on social media that he would also be meeting with a French general who represents Paris in the ceasefire monitoring mechanism. This monitoring group includes representatives from Lebanon, Israel, the United States, France, and the United Nations' UNIFIL peacekeeping mission. Its purpose is to oversee the ceasefire's implementation and assess any potential violations.The post French Ministers Hold Talks with Berri in Ain el-Tineh first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/french-ministers-talks-berri-ain-el-tineh/	2025-01-02T06:35:02-08:00	
Israel Blames ‘Discipline Lapse’ in Death of Archaeologist Crossi...	The Israeli military has attributed the death of a 70-year-old archaeologist and another soldier in southern Lebanon to 'operational burnout' and a 'weakening of discipline and safety' during a visit to a combat zone in November. Zeev Erlich, who was not on active duty at the time, was wearing a military uniform and carrying a weapon when he was shot. Although he was not actively serving, the army classified him as a reservist with the rank of major and referred to him as a 'fallen soldier.' Erlich was a well-known figure in the West Bank, recognized for his work in Jewish history. Reports suggested that he had entered Lebanon to explore an archaeological site. The family of the soldier killed alongside him has expressed frustration over the circumstances surrounding his death. Following the incident, the Israeli military launched an investigation, with a separate inquiry focusing on how Erlich was permitted to enter the combat zone. While the military stressed that the entry of civilians, who are not military contractors or journalists, into such areas is rare, there have been previous reports of Israeli civilians, particularly those in favor of a permanent Israeli presence in Gaza or Lebanon, accessing these regions.The post Israel Blames ‘Discipline Lapse’ in Death of Archaeologist Crossing into Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-discipline-lapse-death-archaeologist/	2025-01-01T07:00:07-08:00	
Iran Set for Nuclear Talks with Europe on January 13	Iran is scheduled to engage in nuclear discussions with France, Britain, and Germany on January 13 in Geneva, Switzerland, as reported by local media. Kazem Gharibabadi, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister for Legal and International Affairs, confirmed that these meetings are intended as 'consultations, not negotiations.' This upcoming round of talks follows a November 2024 meeting where tensions escalated after a European-backed resolution accused Iran of inadequate cooperation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog. In response, Tehran announced plans to install additional uranium-enriching centrifuges at its enrichment facilities. The United Nations' nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, has expressed concern over Iran's accelerated uranium enrichment, noting that Iran is 'dramatically' increasing its enrichment levels to up to 60% purity, which is closer to the approximately 90% purity required for weapons-grade uranium. In 2018, the United States withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement under President Donald Trump and reimposed stringent sanctions on Iran. This action prompted Tehran to violate the agreement's nuclear limits, including rebuilding stockpiles of enriched uranium, refining it to higher fissile purity, and installing advanced centrifuges to expedite production. Indirect talks between the Biden administration and Tehran to revive the pact have been unsuccessful. President Trump has indicated a willingness to negotiate, stating during his election campaign in September: 'We have to make a deal, because the consequences are impossible. We have to make a deal.' As the January 13 talks approach, the international community remains attentive to Iran's nuclear activities and its engagement with European powers, with hopes for a resolution that addresses proliferation concerns and regional stability.

Israel Strikes Hezbollah Arms Transfer in Southern Lebanon	The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have conducted airstrikes in southern Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah operatives involved in transferring weapons. The IDF released footage showing Hezbollah members moving arms in the region prior to the strikes. This action is part of Israel's ongoing efforts to enforce ceasefire agreements and prevent the smuggling of arms to Hezbollah. The IDF has previously targeted Hezbollah's weapon smuggling routes in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, aiming to disrupt arms transfers from Syria. The situation in southern Lebanon remains tense, with both Israel and Hezbollah accusing each other of ceasefire violations. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) has expressed concerns over the ongoing hostilities, urging both parties to adhere to the ceasefire and avoid further escalation. The IDF's recent actions underscore the complexities of maintaining peace in the region, highlighting the challenges in monitoring and enforcing ceasefire agreements. The international community continues to call for restraint and dialogue to prevent further violence and instability.The post Israel Strikes Hezbollah Arms Transfer in Southern Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-strikes-hezbollah-arms-transfer/	2025-01-01T06:59:51-08:00	
10 Dead, 30 Injured in New Orleans Vehicle Attack	A man with a clear intent to cause widespread destruction drove a pickup truck at high speed into a crowd of people celebrating New Year's Eve in New Orleans, leading to at least ten fatalities and leaving over 35 others injured. The incident took place around 3:15 am local time in the city's lively French Quarter, which was filled with revelers welcoming 2025. Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick stated that the driver appeared determined to run over as many people as possible. Additionally, the driver shot at police officers, injuring two of them, and was intent on causing as much harm as he could. The whereabouts and condition of the driver remain unknown at this time. While the attack is not officially categorized as a terrorist act, Superintendent Kirkpatrick emphasized the truck’s high speed and the deliberate nature of the incident. The FBI will now lead the investigation into the event. Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry described the attack as a 'horrific act of violence.' Eyewitnesses told CBS News that the truck drove through the crowd before the driver got out and began shooting at police officers. Witnesses Jim and Nicole Mowrer described seeing a white truck break through a barricade at high speed. Nicole Mowrer recounted hearing gunfire and seeing police rush toward the scene. After the shooting stopped, they stayed in a safe spot until it was secure, and when they emerged, they saw several victims who had been struck and tried to help them. The attack occurred just before New Orleans was set to host the Sugar Bowl, a major football game between the University of Georgia and Notre Dame. Despite heightened police presence in anticipation of large crowds for the celebrations, the city was rocked by the tragedy.The post 10 Dead, 30 Injured in New Orleans Vehicle Attack first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/10-dead-30-injured-new-orleans-vehicle-attack/	2025-01-01T06:59:40-08:00	
French Ministers Visit Lebanon for Talks Amid Israel-Hezbollah Tr...	France's Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot and Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu arrived in Lebanon on Monday, marking their visit after a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah brought an end to the intense fighting that had plagued the region since late November. During their visit, Barrot and Lecornu met with Lebanese army chief Joseph Aoun. The following day, they are scheduled to visit U.N. peacekeepers stationed near the Israeli border. According to a statement from the Lebanese army on social media, the discussions between Aoun and the French officials focused on strengthening cooperation between the two countries' armies and continuing support for the Lebanese army in light of the ongoing situation. Aoun, who is considered a potential candidate for Lebanon’s presidency, has been responsible for deploying troops in southern Lebanon since the ceasefire took effect on November 27. Lecornu stated on social media that he is also set to meet with a French general involved in the ceasefire monitoring mechanism. He emphasized France's ongoing commitment to the stability of Lebanon and the broader region. This monitoring body includes representatives from Lebanon, Israel, the United States, France, and the U.N.'s UNIFIL peacekeeping mission, and is tasked with overseeing the ceasefire's implementation and addressing any violations. The UNIFIL peacekeeping force expressed concern on Thursday over the ongoing destruction in southern Lebanon by the Israeli army, despite the ceasefire being in place. On Tuesday, Lecornu and Barrot are expected to meet with French troops serving in the UNIFIL mission in southern Lebanon.The post French Ministers Visit Lebanon for Talks Amid Israel-Hezbollah Truce first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/french-ministers-lebanon-talks-truce/	2024-12-31T09:57:56-08:00	
Hezbollah Warns Israel: Leave South Lebanon After 60 Days	Mahmoud Qmati, the deputy head of Hezbollah's political council, has issued a warning that Hezbollah will change its approach towards Israeli soldiers if they remain in Lebanon for more than 60 days, which marks the initial phase of a ceasefire agreed upon in late November. Qmati explained that Hezbollah has committed to a period of patience for 60 days, but after this time, Israeli forces will be viewed as occupying troops, and Hezbollah will take appropriate action. The ceasefire agreement, brokered by France and the United States, outlines a gradual withdrawal of both Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters from southern Lebanon over the 60-day period. However, since the ceasefire began, Israel has continued to carry out occasional airstrikes in Lebanon, and its troops have advanced instead of retreating, bulldozing villages and detonating explosives along the border. Qmati emphasized that there are red lines, including issues related to Hezbollah’s weapons and the funding for reconstruction efforts. He accused certain domestic figures of acting in Israel's interests and stressed that Hezbollah does not want aid tied to conditions that would undermine its resistance. He further warned that France and the U.S. must understand that Hezbollah will not tolerate violations of these red lines, and they are prepared to take any necessary action. He reiterated that Hezbollah would not accept the occupation of Lebanon's land. Hezbollah has been patient so far for the sake of its people and in keeping with its commitment to the mediators. However, Qmati made it clear that after the 60-day period, on day 61, Hezbollah will treat Israeli forces as occupiers and respond accordingly. He also stated that Hezbollah's resistance capabilities remain strong and that the group is not bound by the ceasefire if Israel does not fully honor it. He indicated that either both sides must commit to the ceasefire, or neither will. Qmati added that many supporters and residents who have returned to villages in southern Lebanon are now calling on Hezbollah to take action in response to Israeli violations. He noted that the patience displayed by Hezbollah so far was for the benefit of these people, but now they are demanding retaliation.The post Hezbollah Warns Israel: Leave South Lebanon After 60 Days first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-warns-israel-leave-south-lebanon-60-days/	2024-12-31T09:57:49-08:00	
Syria’s Leader: Elections Could Take Up to 4 Years	Syria's current de facto leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, stated that it could take up to four years to organize elections in Syria. He also plans to disband his Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which has led the insurgency and is now overseeing the new authority in the country. Al-Sharaa shared these insights during an interview with Saudi television channel Al-Arabiya, nearly a month after HTS successfully overthrew President Bashar al-Assad's regime, which had been in power for decades. This move marked the end of the civil war that had been raging in Syria since 2011. According to al-Sharaa, elections will require time due to the need for political dialogue among Syria’s various factions and the rewriting of the country’s constitution, which has been under the rule of the Assad family for over fifty years. He also mentioned that the country’s infrastructure, severely damaged by the war, must be rebuilt. Al-Sharaa emphasized that the opportunity Syria now faces is rare and could not be expected again soon. He expressed a desire for the new constitution to be stable and enduring. Until March 1, al-Sharaa will continue as Syria's de facto leader. On that date, Syria's various factions are scheduled to engage in political discussions to shape the country’s future and establish a transitional government. At that time, HTS plans to dissolve, following years of dominance as the primary rebel group controlling a strategic region in the northwest of Syria.The post Syria’s Leader: Elections Could Take Up to 4 Years first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/syrias-leader-election-take-4-years/	2024-12-30T08:51:46-08:00	
Diplomats from France, US, and Saudi Arabia to Visit Lebanon for ...	Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri has called for a parliamentary session on January 9 to elect a president, aiming to resolve the two-year deadlock and revive Lebanon’s struggling state institutions. The session will start with multiple rounds of voting, and Berri emphasized that the key objective is for parliament to elect a president and for members to take responsibility. French Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Noël Barrot and Minister of the French Armed Forces Sébastien Lecornu are scheduled to visit Lebanon on Monday. They are expected to pressure Lebanese leaders to resolve the ongoing presidential crisis. Additionally, U.S. mediator Amos Hochstein and Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan are expected to arrive in Lebanon in early January to discuss the presidential election. Hochstein will meet with Berri and caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati, as well as discuss the ceasefire agreement reached with Israel in late November, according to local media reports. Pro-Hezbollah newspaper al-Akhbar reported that the French, Saudi, and U.S. delegations will likely push for the election of Army chief Gen. Joseph Aoun. Since Michel Aoun's term ended in October 2022, Lebanon has been without a president, with the two main political blocs—Hezbollah and its rivals—unable to reach a consensus or secure the necessary majority for election.The post Diplomats from France, US, and Saudi Arabia to Visit Lebanon for Presidential Talks first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/diplomats-france-us-saudi-arabia-lebanon/	2024-12-30T08:51:36-08:00	
Geagea Vows to Block Hezbollah and FPM’s Presidential ‘Smuggling’...	Samir Geagea, leader of the Lebanese Forces, stated that Lebanon's ruling 'establishment' remains firmly entrenched and unified. He described this establishment as consisting of Hezbollah, its allies, and the Free Patriotic Movement. Despite the emerging differences among the key factions within the establishment, Geagea pointed out that these groups are once again aligning with one another. The disagreements are secondary to their primary concern: their own survival and interests. Geagea also mentioned that the establishment is working discreetly to secure a new president, but they can no longer achieve the kind of leadership they originally desired. He noted that the political climate, both within the Arab world and internationally, is no longer in the establishment's favor, with external parties closely monitoring their actions.

Ukraine FM Calls for Expulsion of Russian Forces During Syria Vis...	Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga made an unannounced visit to Damascus on Monday, urging Syria's new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa to expel Russian forces from the country. Russia had been a crucial ally of former president Bashar al-Assad, intervening in 2015 to help reverse the tide of Syria’s civil war in Assad’s favor. The overthrow of Assad was a significant blow to Russia, which has since launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Currently, Russia is focused on securing its naval base in Tartus and its air base at Hmeimim, both on Syria's Mediterranean coast, as these are Moscow’s only military installations outside the former Soviet Union. Sybiga stated that both the Russian and Assad regimes relied on violence and torture to maintain control, and he emphasized that removing Russian influence from Syria would benefit not only Syria’s stability but also the broader Middle East and Africa. Sybiga also expressed Ukraine’s willingness to restore relations with Syria, which had soured when Assad recognized Russia's annexation of Ukrainian territories. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Ukraine had sent its first shipment of aid to Syria—a 500-tonne delivery of wheat flour—despite the ongoing war in Ukraine, highlighting Ukraine’s position as one of the world's leading wheat producers. Meanwhile, rebels led by Sharaa's Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), launched an offensive on November 27, quickly capturing several key cities before seizing the capital, Damascus, on December 8, forcing Assad to flee to Russia. Despite Russia’s continued support for Assad, Sharaa emphasized the deep strategic interests between Russia and Syria in an interview with Al-Arabiya TV, stating that Syria’s arms are all of Russian origin and many power plants are operated by Russian experts. He expressed opposition to the idea of Russia withdrawing from Syria in the manner some might hope for.The post Ukraine FM Calls for Expulsion of Russian Forces During Syria Visit first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/ukraine-fm-expulsion-russian-forces-syria-visit/	2024-12-30T08:51:21-08:00	
Russia Claims Ukrainian Drones Target Grozny as Azerbaijani Jet L...	Recommend tags for this article. The head of Russia's civil aviation agency stated on Friday that Ukrainian drones were targeting Grozny while an Azerbaijani Airlines plane was attempting to land there, before the plane later crashed in Kazakhstan. Dmitry Yadrov shared on Telegram that heavy fog had blanketed Grozny when the incident took place on Wednesday, creating 'very complicated' conditions around the airport at the time.Yadrov noted that Ukrainian military drones were carrying out attacks on civilian infrastructure during the event, and the plane had attempted to land twice unsuccessfully. The pilot was then offered the option to land at alternative airports, ultimately choosing to divert to Aktau Airport in Kazakhstan.Additionally, Yadrov mentioned that Grozny Airport had halted both arrivals and departures due to the drone attacks, though he did not specify when this occurred. The Azerbaijan Airlines plane eventually crashed in western Kazakhstan, resulting in the deaths of 38 out of the 67 people on board. Several media outlets have cited Azerbaijani officials suggesting that a Russian air defense missile might have caused the crash. The Kremlin has refrained from commenting on the situation, awaiting the conclusion of the official investigation.

China and Iran FMs: Mideast Shouldn’t Be Big Power Battleground	The foreign ministers of China and Iran agreed on Saturday that the Middle East should not be a region for external geopolitical competition or conflict among major powers. They emphasized that the region must not become a battleground for nations outside the Middle East. Abbas Araghchi, Iran's new foreign minister, is on his first official visit to China. During his discussions with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the two diplomats highlighted the need for international respect for the sovereignty, stability, unity, and territorial integrity of Middle Eastern countries. Both ministers called for a ceasefire in Gaza, the proper enforcement of the ceasefire in Lebanon, and the advancement of efforts related to counter-terrorism, reconciliation, and humanitarian aid in Syria. They agreed that the Middle East belongs to its own people and should not be subject to the geopolitical interests and conflicts of external powers. China and Iran have both supported Syria's former president Bashar al-Assad, although the new Syrian leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, opposes Iran’s influence. In addition to regional issues, the two diplomats discussed Iran's nuclear program, which has raised concerns, particularly from the United States and the UK, regarding potential weapons development. Tensions surrounding Iran's nuclear activities escalated after former President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from a key agreement that had placed limits on Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. Wang reaffirmed China's support for Iran's position on the matter, emphasizing that Beijing stands by Iran in protecting its legitimate rights and interests. As Iran’s largest trading partner, China is also a major buyer of Iranian oil, despite sanctions.The post China and Iran FMs: Mideast Shouldn’t Be Big Power Battleground first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/china-iran-mideast-shouldnt-battleground/	2024-12-29T06:11:13-08:00	
Assad Relatives Arrested Attempting to Flee Lebanon	On Friday, the wife and daughter of one of deposed Syrian president Bashar Assad's cousins were apprehended at Beirut airport for attempting to leave with allegedly forged passports, according to Lebanese judicial and security sources. Assad's uncle had departed the day before without issue. Rasha Khazem, wife of Duraid Assad (son of Rifaat Assad, Bashar's uncle), and their daughter, Shams, were caught trying to fly to Egypt after being smuggled into Lebanon illegally. The two are now being held by Lebanese General Security. Rifaat Assad, known for his brutal past, left the country a day earlier with his real passport, and no issues were reported at the time. Swiss prosecutors had indicted Rifaat Assad earlier in the year for war crimes and crimes against humanity related to his role in the Hama massacre, where thousands of Syrians were killed under his command, earning him the infamous title of the 'Butcher of Hama.' In addition, Lebanese authorities have detained over 20 former members of Syria’s 4th Division, military intelligence officers, and others linked to Assad's regime, many of whom were arrested while attempting to sell weapons in Lebanon. Meanwhile, Lebanon's public prosecution office received an Interpol alert regarding Jamil al-Hassan, the former head of Syrian intelligence. Lebanese officials have confirmed their intent to cooperate with the request to arrest al-Hassan.The post Assad Relatives Arrested Attempting to Flee Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/assad-relatives-arrested-flee-lebanon/	2024-12-29T06:11:06-08:00	
Breaking: Plane Explodes After Skidding Off Runway in South Korea...	A passenger plane caught fire on Sunday after it skidded off a runway at an airport in South Korea, crashing into a concrete wall. The incident, caused by a possible failure of the plane’s front landing gear, resulted in the deaths of most of the 181 people onboard, making it one of the deadliest aviation disasters in South Korean history. The crash occurred at the Muan airport, located about 290 kilometers south of Seoul. The plane, a 15-year-old Boeing 737-800, was returning from Bangkok when the accident happened at 9:03 a.m. According to the National Fire Agency, at least 176 people, including 83 women and 82 men, were confirmed dead in the ensuing fire. Two crew members were rescued and are reportedly in stable condition. Three individuals were still missing after several hours of rescue operations. Rescuers, including 1,560 firefighters, police, and soldiers, worked tirelessly to contain the blaze and assist survivors. Emergency crews deployed 32 fire trucks and helicopters to help with the operation. Footage of the crash showed the plane sliding across the runway, apparently with its landing gear still retracted. After overrunning the runway, it collided with a concrete wall, sparking a massive explosion. The fire chief at Muan airport stated that the plane was completely destroyed, leaving only the tail section intact. Investigations are ongoing to determine the cause of the crash, with initial theories including a potential bird strike. Authorities noted that the control tower had issued a bird strike warning shortly before the incident. They also confirmed that the pilot had issued a distress signal before the crash. Flight data and cockpit voice recorders from the plane have been recovered and will be analyzed as part of the investigation. The Muan airport runway has been closed until January 1 for further examination. The passengers included two Thai nationals, and Thailand’s prime minister expressed condolences and pledged assistance to the victims' families. Jeju Air, the airline operating the flight, offered a deep apology and vowed to manage the aftermath of the tragedy. In a public statement, the airline's president took full responsibility for the crash, stating that no mechanical issues had been reported following the aircraft’s regular maintenance. The crash is one of the worst in South Korea’s aviation history, rivaling previous disasters such as the 1997 Korean Air crash that killed 228 people and the 2013 Asiana Airlines accident in San Francisco. Internationally, it is one of the worst landing accidents in recent years. As the nation grapples with this tragedy, it is also in the midst of a political crisis, with the president facing impeachment and martial law. The crisis added another layer of complexity to the emergency response, with senior government officials coordinating efforts to address the disaster.The post Breaking: Plane Explodes After Skidding Off Runway in South Korea, 176 Dead first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/plane-explodes-skidding-runway-south-korea/	2024-12-29T06:10:58-08:00	
Syrian Embassy Suspends Services as Lebanon Hands Over Assad Offi...	Syria's embassy in Lebanon halted its consular services on Saturday, just one day after two relatives of former Syrian President Bashar Assad were arrested at Beirut airport with suspected fake passports. On the same day, Lebanese authorities deported dozens of Syrians, including former Syrian army officers who had served under Assad, back to the new Syrian authorities after they were caught illegally entering Lebanon. This information was confirmed by both a war monitor and Lebanese officials. The embassy announced on its Facebook page that consular services were suspended 'until further notice,' following an order from the Syrian foreign ministry. However, the embassy did not provide a reason for the suspension. According to two Lebanese security officials, who asked to remain anonymous, the decision was made because the passports belonging to Assad's relatives—his cousin’s wife and daughter—were believed to have been forged at the embassy. It was noted that Assad’s uncle, Rifaat Assad, who faces war crimes and crimes against humanity charges in Switzerland, had departed on his valid passport the day before without issue. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that 70 Syrians, including former officers from Assad’s army, were handed over to the new Syrian authorities, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). Three Lebanese judicial officials confirmed this information, speaking on condition of anonymity. Meanwhile, countries in the region have been quick to engage with Syria's new leadership, with official visits from delegations from Libya and Bahrain arriving in Damascus on Saturday. HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, has worked to ease fears that his group would punish communities supporting Assad’s rule or impose strict Islamic law on religious minorities in Syria. However, tensions remain, with sporadic clashes erupting between HTS-led forces and pro-Assad groups. The new Syrian security forces have raided areas and set up checkpoints in regions populated by the Alawite minority, which Assad belongs to, to search for weapons. There are also ongoing conflicts between Kurdish-led forces in northeastern Syria and armed groups backed by Turkey. Many Kurds are uneasy about the new Syrian order, which they feel strengthens Turkey’s position in the region. Ankara views the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF)—a key ally of the U.S. in fighting ISIS—as linked to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which it considers a terrorist organization. The U.S. State Department reported that Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan on Saturday to discuss developments in Syria. Blinken emphasized the importance of supporting a Syrian-led political process that respects human rights and promotes an inclusive government, and both sides agreed on the shared goal of preventing terrorism from destabilizing both Syria and Turkey. On the same day, hundreds of protesters organized by Kurdish women's groups took part in a demonstration in Hasaka, a city in northeastern Syria, calling for women's rights in the new political order. Perishan Ramadan, a protester from Hasaka, expressed her concerns, stating that the new government is even worse than Bashar Assad’s regime and accusing its leaders of being Islamist extremists who reject any role for women in society. While the new leaders have yet to impose Islamic dress codes or other restrictions, there is uncertainty about what role women will play in the new system, including whether they will hold political positions. Rihan Loqo, a spokeswoman for the Kongra Star women's organization, stressed the importance of ensuring that women's rights are included in Syria’s new constitution, asserting that their rights must not be overlooked.The post Syrian Embassy Suspends Services as Lebanon Hands Over Assad Officers first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/syrian-embassy-suspends-services-lebanon-assad-officers/	2024-12-29T06:10:50-08:00	
Arab League Urges Iran to Avoid Fanning Syria’s Strife	The Arab League has urged Iran to refrain from inciting unrest in Syria following the collapse of President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Assad, who had ruled for decades with the backing of Iran, was overthrown on December 8 after an Islamist-led coalition seized control of key cities and advanced to Damascus, forcing him to flee to Russia. This marked a significant loss for Iran, which had relied on Assad as an ally, especially as its Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah, also faced setbacks after a year of conflict with Israel. Despite welcoming Assad back into the Arab League after a decade of isolation, the organization emphasized the importance of respecting Syria’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and stability. It called for disarming all non-state groups and rejecting foreign interventions that destabilize the country. The League expressed concern over recent events in Syria, where clashes between government forces and remnants of Assad’s loyalists have erupted. In response, Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, predicted the rise of a strong group in Syria, suggesting the country's youth, with little to lose, would play a key role. Tehran’s foreign ministry rejected claims of interference in Syria’s internal affairs, asserting its commitment to Syria’s territorial integrity and a unified political system. Syria’s new leadership has criticized Iran’s involvement in the country, urging Tehran to respect Syria’s sovereignty and warning against actions that could lead to further chaos.The post Arab League Urges Iran to Avoid Fanning Syria’s Strife first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/arab-league-iran-avoid-fanning-syrias-strife/	2024-12-28T02:27:08-08:00	
Jumblat Urges Security Agencies to Wake Up	Lebanese Druze leader Walid Jumblatt has called on the country's security agencies to intensify their efforts in apprehending former regime officials who are reportedly fleeing the country. In a post on the X platform, Jumblatt noted that while the Lebanese Foreign Ministry has recently engaged with Syria's new administration, the security agencies have yet to take action against these individuals. He questioned whether the security forces could 'wake up' and arrest the senior officials who are crossing the border and fleeing through the airport. This statement follows Jumblatt's recent visit to Damascus, where he met with Syria's new leadership. During the meeting, Jumblatt expressed hope for the resumption of diplomatic relations between Lebanon and Syria through the establishment of embassies. He also emphasized the importance of holding accountable those responsible for crimes against the Lebanese people and called for fair trials for all perpetrators. Jumblatt's remarks highlight ongoing concerns about the accountability of former regime officials and the need for proactive measures by security agencies to address these issues.The post Jumblat Urges Security Agencies to Wake Up first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/jumblat-security-agencies-wake-up/	2024-12-28T01:20:26-08:00	
Hochstein Set to Reject Iran’s Role in Lebanon Reconstruction	U.S. mediator Amos Hochstein is poised to deliver a firm message to Lebanese officials, asserting that Iran will not be permitted to participate in Lebanon's reconstruction efforts. This stance aims to prevent Iranian influence from infiltrating the rebuilding process, particularly through financial channels that could potentially support Hezbollah. Hochstein's upcoming visit underscores the United States' commitment to ensuring that Lebanon's reconstruction is managed exclusively by the Lebanese government, free from external interference. The U.S. is determined to prevent any Iranian involvement, whether through direct aid or the engagement of Iranian companies, to maintain the integrity of the reconstruction process. This development follows a recent U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, which has significantly altered the regional dynamics. The ceasefire terms require Hezbollah to withdraw heavy weaponry from southern Lebanon, with an American monitoring mechanism to enforce this. However, doubts remain about the ceasefire’s durability due to past enforcement failures of similar agreements. The Lebanese government now faces the critical task of navigating these geopolitical pressures while striving to rebuild the nation. The exclusion of Iran from the reconstruction process is expected to have significant implications for Lebanon's political landscape and its relationships with neighboring countries.

Iran FM Warns Against Interference in Syria’s Future	Iran's foreign minister warned on Friday against any 'destructive interference' in Syria's future, emphasizing that the decisions regarding the country's future should be made solely by its people. Abbas Araghchi, who arrived in Beijing on Friday for his first official visit to China as foreign minister, made the remarks in an article published in the Chinese state media. Both China and Iran have been supporters of the Syrian regime under Bashar al-Assad, who was forced to flee Syria this month after an Islamist-led offensive resulted in the loss of several key cities, including Damascus on December 8. In his article in People's Daily, Araghchi stated that Iran believes it is up to the Syrian people to decide their future, without any external interference or imposition. He reaffirmed Iran's commitment to Syria's sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a strong ally of Assad's regime, expressed confidence on Sunday that a 'strong, honorable group' would rise to oppose the instability in Syria. Khamenei emphasized that Syria's youth would resist those responsible for the chaos and, with determination, overcome the challenges. Araghchi, in his article, highlighted that supporting the Syrian people is a fundamental principle that all international parties should keep in mind. China, which also maintains a close relationship with Assad, has expressed its support for the Syrian people and opposes any forces exploiting the situation to sow further chaos. In 2023, Assad met with Chinese President Xi Jinping, and the two leaders announced a strategic partnership between their countries. During his two-day visit, Araghchi is expected to hold talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. China is Iran's largest trade partner and a key purchaser of its sanctioned oil. Xi Jinping had previously pledged to strengthen ties with Iran during a meeting with Iranian officials in Russia in October. Araghchi described his visit as timely, given the current tensions in the region and international issues, including the ongoing nuclear discussions. He mentioned that both countries share a common viewpoint that calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza should be a top priority in the Middle East.The post Iran FM Warns Against Interference in Syria’s Future first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/iran-fm-warns-interference-syrias-future/	2024-12-27T05:45:13-08:00	
US Presses Israel to End Violations and Withdraw from Lebanon	The United States has intensified its diplomatic efforts, urging Israel to cease its military operations in southern Lebanon and to fully withdraw its forces, as stipulated in the recent ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah. This call comes amid reports of Israeli incursions into southern Lebanon, raising concerns about the implementation of the ceasefire terms. Israeli forces have reportedly advanced into areas beyond the agreed-upon limits, with incursions reaching up to 8 kilometers north of the UN-designated Blue Line. This escalation has led to increased tensions and displacement of local residents. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which includes 380 Irish soldiers, has expressed deep concern over these developments, highlighting the ongoing destruction of residential and agricultural areas. UNIFIL has called for the immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces and adherence to UN Resolution 1701, which mandates a phased Israeli military pullout and the repositioning of Hezbollah fighters. In response to these violations, the U.S. has emphasized the importance of Israel's compliance with the ceasefire agreement. The U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) reported that Israeli forces conducted a withdrawal from a town in southern Lebanon, with the Lebanese military replacing them under the terms of the ceasefire. The U.S. administration has underscored that the future of Syria should be determined solely by its people, free from external interference. This stance aligns with Iran's position, as expressed by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi during his visit to Beijing. Araghchi emphasized Iran's respect for Syria's unity, national sovereignty, and territorial integrity, advocating for decisions to be made by the Syrian people without foreign imposition. The situation remains fluid, with international stakeholders closely monitoring the developments to ensure the full implementation of the ceasefire and the withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon.

Israel Strikes ‘Infrastructure’ on Syria-Lebanon Border	On December 27, 2024, the Israeli military conducted airstrikes targeting infrastructure along the Syria-Lebanon border, specifically near the village of Janta in Lebanon's Beqaa Valley. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) stated that these strikes aimed to dismantle infrastructure utilized by Hezbollah for weapon transfers. The IDF emphasized that Hezbollah exploits civilian infrastructure for terrorist activities and weapon smuggling intended for attacks against Israeli citizens. The military asserted its commitment to removing any threats to Israel in accordance with the understandings outlined in the ceasefire agreement. This military action follows a recent statement from the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which expressed concern over the ongoing destruction by the Israeli military despite a truce agreement with Hezbollah. UNIFIL has called for the withdrawal of Israeli forces and adherence to UN Resolution 1701, which mandates a phased Israeli military pullout and the repositioning of Hezbollah fighters. The situation remains tense, with the IDF asserting its right to defend Israeli citizens and UNIFIL urging compliance with international resolutions to maintain stability in the region.

Houthis Claim Fresh Attacks on Israel After Yemen Airport Strikes	Yemeni rebels, led by the Houthi movement, claimed responsibility for a missile strike on Israel's Ben Gurion airport and drone attacks on Tel Aviv and a ship in the Arabian Sea, following Israeli airstrikes on rebel-held areas in Yemen. These attacks come after a series of airstrikes by Israel, including a raid on Sanaa's international airport, as tensions between Israel and the Houthis escalate. The Israeli strikes, which targeted military sites, power stations, and ports in Yemen's rebel-controlled territories, followed a missile attack from the Houthis. Israel’s military stated the strikes were aimed at disrupting Houthi military infrastructure and halting Iranian weapons smuggling into the region. The United Nations voiced concern over the escalation, with Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemning the attacks on vital infrastructure, which threaten Yemen's already fragile humanitarian operations. UN Chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who had been in Yemen to negotiate the release of detained UN staff, narrowly escaped injury when the Sanaa airport came under bombardment. The Houthis have intensified their attacks against Israel since late November, and their missile and drone assaults have been aimed at Israeli cities and shipping routes in the Red Sea. Israel has retaliated with airstrikes targeting Houthi-controlled regions, including strategic sites in Sanaa and Hodeida, vital for the entry of humanitarian aid. The conflict has been marked by growing tensions between Israel, Yemen’s Houthis, and Iran, which supports the rebel group in their fight against Saudi-led forces in Yemen.The post Houthis Claim Fresh Attacks on Israel After Yemen Airport Strikes first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/houthis-attacks-israel-yemen-airport-strikes/	2024-12-27T05:44:50-08:00	
Mikati Denies Lebanon Was Told Israel Won’t Withdraw After 60 Day...	On Friday, Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati rejected claims from media reports suggesting that Lebanon had been indirectly informed that Israel would not pull out of southern Lebanon after the 60-day period outlined in the ceasefire agreement. Mikati's office described these reports as 'completely unfounded' and emphasized that the prime minister had urged both the U.S. and France to pressure Israel to withdraw from Lebanese territory and end its ongoing violations. Israeli military sources had informed Haaretz newspaper that the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) might need to remain in Lebanon until the Lebanese army fulfills its obligations under the ceasefire agreement, which includes assuming full control of southern Lebanon. The ceasefire agreement, brokered by the U.S. and other nations, has been in effect for 30 days as of Thursday. Haaretz reported that during this period, the IDF had killed 44 Hezbollah militants in strikes related to violations of the ceasefire. The IDF had responded to 25 of the 120 violations by Hezbollah. At present, the IDF is satisfied with the ceasefire's implementation, coordinated with the Lebanese army, and with U.S. involvement in its enforcement. The Israeli military maintains its presence in all Lebanese villages near the border fence, preventing residents from returning. Additionally, the IDF has begun constructing outposts along the northern border, some of which will be located in Israeli-controlled enclaves. Despite this, these outposts do not cross the international border between Israel and Lebanon. The Israeli military estimates that Hezbollah has lost 30% of its manpower and 75% of its firepower since the conflict began, though the group still possesses hundreds of short- and long-range rockets.The post Mikati Denies Lebanon Was Told Israel Won’t Withdraw After 60 Days first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/mikati-denies-lebanon-israel-wont-withdraw/	2024-12-27T05:44:39-08:00	
Watch: Priest with Machine Gun in Church Sparks Outrage in Lebano...	كاهن مزرعة يشوع يدخل الى صلاة العيد حاملاً سلاح حربي pic.twitter.com/AqlZOSNsY1 &mdash; مصدر مسؤول (@fouadkhreiss) December 25, 2024 A video showing a priest with a machine gun slung over his shoulder inside a church in Lebanon’s Mazraat Yachouh has sparked widespread attention and controversy on social media. The Maronite Diocese of Antelias condemned the priest’s actions, clarifying that the stunt, which was not sanctioned by the church, was part of a sermon aimed at emphasizing that 'a believer’s weapon is the cross.' According to a statement from the diocese, the priest placed the weapon in front of the congregation and urged them to abandon all forms of violence that harm others, encouraging them to embrace the cross as the only true weapon—symbolizing love and forgiveness. While the diocese expressed approval of the sermon’s message, which aligns with the church’s teachings, it distanced itself from the method used by the priest. The church issued a written warning, requesting that such actions not be repeated. The diocese also emphasized the importance of preventing the incident from being seen through a sectarian lens and hoped it would not be used to fuel division or resentment, particularly given the current tensions in the country.The post Watch: Priest with Machine Gun in Church Sparks Outrage in Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/priest-machine-gun-church-outrage-lebanon/	2024-12-26T06:34:20-08:00	
Israeli Strike Kills 5 Palestinian Journalists in Gaza	An Israeli airstrike overnight in the Gaza Strip killed five Palestinian journalists outside a hospital, according to the Health Ministry. The attack targeted a car near the Al-Awda Hospital in the Nuseirat refugee camp, located in central Gaza. The journalists were working for the Quds News Network, which also confirmed the strike. The Israeli military stated that it was targeting a group of militants from Islamic Jihad, a group affiliated with Hamas, which launched the October 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, sparking the ongoing conflict. The Committee to Protect Journalists reported that more than 130 Palestinian reporters have been killed since the war began. Israel has restricted access to Gaza for foreign journalists, allowing only military embeds. The conflict started when Hamas militants breached the border in a surprise assault, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking approximately 250 hostages. As of now, about 100 hostages remain in Gaza, with at least a third feared dead. Israel's ongoing air and ground offensive has claimed the lives of more than 45,000 Palestinians, with the Health Ministry stating that over half of the casualties are women and children. The military actions have caused widespread devastation, displacing about 90% of Gaza's population, which totals 2.3 million. Many have sought refuge in overcrowded tent camps along the coast, struggling to endure the harsh winter conditions.The post Israeli Strike Kills 5 Palestinian Journalists in Gaza first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strike-kills-5-palestinian-journalists-gaza/	2024-12-26T06:34:12-08:00	
UNIFIL Condemns Israel’s Destruction of Homes, Infrastructure in ...	The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) issued a warning on Thursday, emphasizing the importance of halting any actions that could jeopardize the fragile ceasefire in southern Lebanon. The organization reiterated that both Israel and Lebanon had committed to fully implementing Security Council resolution 1701 and encouraged both sides to use the newly-established Mechanism to resolve any remaining issues. UNIFIL called for the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) to withdraw from southern Lebanon and for the Lebanese Armed Forces to deploy in the area as part of the full implementation of resolution 1701, which aims to pave the way for peace. The peacekeeping force emphasized that it would continue to support both countries in fulfilling their obligations and monitoring progress. This includes ensuring the area south of the Litani River remains free of armed personnel and weapons, except for those of the Lebanese government and UNIFIL, and upholding respect for the Blue Line. The statement also expressed concern over ongoing destruction caused by Israeli forces in southern Lebanon, including damage to residential areas, farmland, and infrastructure, which it deemed a violation of resolution 1701. UNIFIL peacekeepers will persist in their duties to monitor and report violations of the resolution to the Security Council. A truce between Israel and Hezbollah went into effect on November 27, following an escalation of violence in the region. Since then, both sides have accused each other of violating the ceasefire. The ceasefire agreement stipulated that UNIFIL and the Lebanese Army would redeploy in southern Lebanon, with Israeli forces pulling back over a period of 60 days. The resolution calls for the withdrawal of Israeli troops and the establishment of Lebanese and UNIFIL forces as the only military presence in the area, where Hezbollah holds significant influence. Earlier this week, UNIFIL had urged quicker progress regarding the Israeli military's withdrawal. Meanwhile, Lebanon's National News Agency reported continued Israeli military activities in southern Lebanon, including an incursion into the town of Qantara, which led to residents fleeing to nearby villages. Additionally, Israeli aircraft struck the eastern Baalbek region, far from the border, on Wednesday.The post UNIFIL Condemns Israel’s Destruction of Homes, Infrastructure in South Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/unifil-israels-destruction-homes-infrastructure/	2024-12-26T06:34:01-08:00	
Israeli Army Raids Wadi al-Hujeir, Detains Citizen, Forces Evacua...	On Thursday, Israeli forces violated the ceasefire agreement by entering southern areas including al-Qantara, Adsheet al-Qusayr, and Wadi al-Hujeir, according to the Lebanese Army. The army accused Israel of continuing to breach the ceasefire, undermining Lebanon’s sovereignty, and causing destruction in southern towns and villages. In response, the Lebanese Army increased its presence in the affected areas and continued to monitor the situation in coordination with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and the five-party ceasefire monitoring committee. Israeli forces, advancing in the region, used heavy machine guns and forced residents of al-Qantara to flee to nearby towns like al-Ghandouriyeh and Srifa. Additionally, Israeli forces abducted Lebanese citizen Hossam Fawwaz while he was on his way to work at the UNIFIL Indonesian contingent in Adsheet al-Qusayr. Fawwaz was later released and handed over to UNIFIL and the Lebanese Red Cross, who transported him to receive treatment for a gunshot wound to his head. These incidents led the Lebanese Army to block the road between its post in Qaaqaaiyet al-Jisr and Wadi al-Hujeir, while Israeli Merkava tanks patrolled the valley, accompanied by Israeli machinegun fire. The Majdal Selm Municipality also advised locals to avoid the Slouqi-Hujeir road towards Nabatieh and its surrounding sideroads. Later, a UNIFIL patrol visited the al-Qantara intersection, where Israeli forces were present. The National News Agency reported that Israeli bulldozers were constructing dirt barriers to block the road connecting Wadi Slouqi to Wadi al-Hujeir. In response to these actions, Hezbollah’s Caretaker Labor Minister Mustafa Bayram called for a 'historic lesson' and declared that resistance remains the only viable solution. Hezbollah lawmaker Ali Fayyad condemned the Israeli incursion, labeling it 'extremely dangerous' and a serious threat to the implementation of UN Resolution 1701.The post Israeli Army Raids Wadi al-Hujeir, Detains Citizen, Forces Evacuations first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-army-raids-wadi-al-hujeir-detains-citizen/	2024-12-26T06:33:52-08:00	
Report: Israeli Army Plans Extended Stay in Lebanon Beyond Ceasef...	According to sources within the Israeli military, the Israeli army has stated that it will need to remain in Lebanon until the Lebanese army can fully take control of southern Lebanon, as stipulated by the terms of the ceasefire agreement. This agreement, which was brokered by the U.S. and other nations, came into effect 30 days ago, marking a month since the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. During this period, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) reported that 44 Hezbollah militants were killed in strikes by the IDF for violating the ceasefire. Of the 120 violations recorded, the army launched attacks in response to 25 of them. Currently, the IDF is satisfied with the implementation of the agreement, noting that it has been carried out in cooperation with the Lebanese army and with support from the United States. The Israeli army remains stationed in all Lebanese villages near the border, where residents have not yet been allowed to return. Additionally, the IDF has begun constructing outposts along the northern border, some of which will be positioned in Israeli-controlled areas beyond the border fence. These outposts will not cross the international boundary between Israel and Lebanon, although in certain areas considered vulnerable, the outposts will be located in enclaves beyond the border. The Israeli military believes that Hezbollah has suffered significant losses during the conflict, with an estimated 30% of its manpower and 75% of its firepower destroyed since October 6, 2023. Despite these losses, the defense establishment assesses that Hezbollah still possesses hundreds of short-range rockets and long-range missiles.The post Report: Israeli Army Plans Extended Stay in Lebanon Beyond Ceasefire Terms first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-army-extended-stay-lebanon/	2024-12-26T06:33:42-08:00	
Pakistani Airstrikes Kill 46 in Afghanistan	Airstrikes conducted by Pakistan in Afghanistan's eastern Paktika province have resulted in the deaths of 46 people, according to a spokesperson for the Taliban government. The Pakistani attacks are the latest escalation in the ongoing tensions at the border, which have been rising since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 2021. Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban spokesman, reported that the airstrikes hit four areas in the Barmal district on Tuesday. The majority of those killed were women and children, and six others were injured, also mostly children. The Taliban condemned the airstrikes, calling them 'barbaric' and an act of 'clear aggression.' They stated that they would not let this act go unanswered and emphasized their right to defend Afghan territory and sovereignty. These strikes follow previous clashes at the border, including deadly airstrikes in March by Pakistan that the Taliban said killed eight civilians. Maleel, a local resident of Barmal, reported that one family lost 18 members when a bombardment struck their home, while another attack killed three people in a nearby house. The victims were mostly local residents and others who had fled from Waziristan in Pakistan. The Barmal district borders North Waziristan, an area long associated with militancy. Pakistan had launched a military offensive in this region, along with U.S. drone strikes, during the post-9/11 occupation of Afghanistan. The recent airstrike comes after the Pakistani Taliban (TTP), which shares an ideology with the Afghan Taliban, claimed responsibility for an attack on a Pakistani army outpost last week, killing 16 soldiers. Pakistan has expressed concerns about the Taliban providing sanctuary to TTP fighters, accusing them of launching attacks on Pakistani territory without facing repercussions. The Taliban, however, denies these claims and has promised to expel foreign militant groups. A July U.N. Security Council report estimated that as many as 6,500 TTP fighters are based in Afghanistan, with the Taliban not considering them a terrorist group. This growing violence has further strained relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan. In response to security concerns, Pakistan recently initiated a campaign to expel undocumented Afghan migrants. There has been no official comment from Pakistan regarding the latest airstrike. Meanwhile, high-ranking Taliban officials were meeting with Pakistan’s special envoy for Afghanistan in Kabul on the same day the airstrikes occurred.The post Pakistani Airstrikes Kill 46 in Afghanistan first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/pakistani-airstrikes-kill-46-afghanistan/	2024-12-25T11:13:59-08:00	
Syrians Protest Attack on Alawite Shrine After Shocking Video	Protests erupted across several regions of Syria on Wednesday after a video emerged showing an attack on an Alawite shrine in northern Syria, according to witnesses and a war monitor. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that large demonstrations took place in the coastal cities of Tartus and Latakia, which are home to the Alawite minority, the sect to which former president Bashar al-Assad belongs. Protests were also reported in parts of the central city of Homs and other areas, including Qardaha, Assad's hometown. Witnesses informed AFP that protests took place in Tartus, Latakia, and nearby Jableh, with images from Jableh showing large crowds in the streets chanting slogans such as 'Alawite, Sunni, we want peace.' In response to the unrest, the state news agency SANA reported that authorities in central Homs imposed a curfew from 6:00 pm to 8:00 am, and a similar nighttime curfew was announced in Jableh. The protests followed the circulation of a video earlier that day showing an attack on a significant Alawite shrine in Aleppo's Maysaloon district. The video claimed that five workers were killed in the attack and the shrine was set on fire. Syrian authorities have dismissed the video as 'old,' claiming it showed an incident from earlier in the month when Islamist-led rebels captured northern Aleppo. An interior ministry statement noted that the video was being republished to 'stir up strife' during a sensitive time for the country. Bashar al-Assad has long portrayed himself as the protector of Syria’s minority groups, particularly the Alawites, in a nation dominated by Sunni Muslims.The post Syrians Protest Attack on Alawite Shrine After Shocking Video first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/syrians-protest-attack-alawite-shrine/	2024-12-25T11:13:49-08:00	
Pop Star Alameh’s Mocking of Nasrallah Sparks Outrage in Lebanon	A video that recently circulated online featuring Lebanese pop star Ragheb Alameh speaking on the phone with Emirati singer Abdullah Belkheir sparked anger among many Lebanese citizens. In the video, Alameh appeared to praise the killing of former Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. Nasrallah, a highly revered figure among his supporters and even some non-supporters of Hezbollah, was killed in September during an Israeli airstrike in Beirut's southern suburbs. Lebanon, already deeply divided along sectarian and political lines, was further polarized by this video, with some defending Alameh's comments while others expressed outrage. In the video, Belkheir, speaking on loudspeaker, responded with a laugh after Alameh allegedly stated that 'we've got rid of Nasrallah,' to which Belkheir responded, 'Thank God.' Following the uproar, Alameh claimed that the voice in the video was either generated by AI or someone impersonating him. In the wake of the controversy, a group of individuals attempted to vandalize Alameh's school in Sainte Therese, Hadath. Alameh, who hails from a Shiite family in Ghoubeiry, Beirut, was granted a UAE golden visa in 2021.The post Pop Star Alameh’s Mocking of Nasrallah Sparks Outrage in Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/pop-star-alamehs-mocking-nasrallah-outrage-lebanon/	2024-12-24T05:28:55-08:00	
Army Seizes PFLP-GC Post in Qousaya	The Lebanese Army has taken control of a key site belonging to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command (PFLP-GC) in Qousaya, located in the Beqaa Valley. This move is part of a broader effort by the Lebanese military to assert control over areas previously held by various armed groups. The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) announced that they had successfully entered the PFLP-GC headquarters and deployed units around the site. This operation is part of a larger campaign that includes taking control of additional locations such as Sultan Yacoub and Bar Elias in the Beqaa region. In addition to securing the PFLP-GC sites, the Lebanese Army's efforts include the recent takeover of positions held by the Fatah al-Intifada group, and the dismantling of weaponry and military equipment from these areas. This initiative aligns with the enforcement of UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which aims to maintain peace and security in the region following the 2006 Lebanon War. Furthermore, the Israeli Army has continued its activities in southern Lebanon, including demolition operations and the establishment of new military posts, which complicates the security dynamics in the region. These developments underscore the ongoing tensions and efforts to stabilize the area, involving various regional and international stakeholders.The post Army Seizes PFLP-GC Post in Qousaya first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/army-seizes-pflp-gc-post-qousaya/	2024-12-24T05:28:29-08:00	
Lebanon PM, UN Urge Faster Israeli Withdrawal	United Nations peacekeepers and interim Prime Minister Najib Mikati have urged the Israeli military to expedite its withdrawal from Lebanon, following nearly a month of a delicate ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. UNIFIL, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, emphasized the need for the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) to accelerate their withdrawal and for the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) to take up positions in southern Lebanon. The force called on all parties to adhere to UN Security Council Resolution 1701 and avoid any actions that could disrupt the current fragile peace. Mikati appealed to the United States and France to pressure Israel into completing its withdrawal more swiftly. He stressed that the international committee, comprising the US, France, Lebanon, Israel, and UNIFIL, must ensure that all ceasefire violations are addressed promptly. As part of the ceasefire agreement, the Lebanese army and peacekeepers are to deploy in southern Lebanon as the Israeli forces withdraw over a 60-day period. Mikati, during a visit to the southern town of Khiam, urged for expedited pressure on Israel to halt all ceasefire violations, accusing Israel of stalling. The Lebanese army reported its deployment around Khiam, five kilometers from the border, in coordination with UNIFIL following the Israeli troop withdrawal. However, the Lebanese National News Agency (NNA) noted continued Israeli activities in southern Lebanon, including raising the Israeli flag on a hill between Bayada and Naqoura and dynamiting homes in border villages. The Israeli military, on the other hand, stated it was continuing defensive operations in the south in line with the agreement and had confiscated various weapons and military equipment from a warehouse. The ceasefire, effective since November 27, followed more than a year of cross-border hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, which escalated into full-scale war and the deployment of Israeli troops into southern Lebanon. Mikati expressed his desire to resolve any disputes regarding the Blue Line, the UN-demarcated boundary between Lebanon and Israel, to eliminate any justification for Israeli occupation. He also mentioned efforts to establish a trust fund for reconstruction, with support from the World Bank, the European Union, Arab nations, and international partners. The World Bank estimated in October that the conflict had caused physical damage in Lebanon amounting to at least $3.4 billion.The post Lebanon PM, UN Urge Faster Israeli Withdrawal first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lebanon-pm-un-faster-israeli-withdrawal/	2024-12-24T05:28:20-08:00	
Netanyahu Reports ‘Some Progress’ in Ceasefire, Hostage Deal	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has indicated there is some advancement in the negotiations for a hostage and ceasefire deal in Gaza, though he did not specify a timeline for a potential agreement. Around 100 of the approximately 250 individuals taken hostage during the Hamas-led raid on Israel on October 7, 2023, remain in Gaza. It is believed that at least a third of these hostages are deceased. Addressing the Knesset on Monday, Netanyahu stated that significant measures are being taken across various channels to secure the return of the hostages. He cautiously noted that there is some progress in these efforts. Netanyahu did not disclose specific actions being undertaken to facilitate the hostages' release. He attributed the progress to the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and Israel's military operations against Iran-backed Hezbollah militants, who have been launching rockets into Israel from Lebanon in support of Hamas. Netanyahu highlighted that Hamas had expected support from Iran and Hezbollah, but these groups are currently focused on recovering from the setbacks inflicted by Israel. He also mentioned the continuous military pressure being applied on Hamas in Gaza. Netanyahu concluded by emphasizing that while there is progress, the duration of the efforts remains uncertain.The post Netanyahu Reports ‘Some Progress’ in Ceasefire, Hostage Deal first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/netanyahu-some-progress-ceasefire-hostage-deal/	2024-12-24T05:28:08-08:00

Israel Frees 7 Civilians Detained in South Lebanon After Truce	On Sunday, Israeli forces handed over seven detainees to United Nations peacekeepers at the border as part of a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. According to Lebanese state media, the prisoners had been held by Israel after the ceasefire came into effect. This event follows Israel's intensified military operations in southern Lebanon, which began in late September, after Hezbollah's cross-border attacks in support of Hamas. These actions were in response to the October 7, 2023, Hamas assault on southern Israel. A ceasefire was established on November 27, though both sides have accused each other of violations since then. The seven detainees were transferred to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) at Ras Naqoura, then taken to a hospital for medical checkups with assistance from the Lebanese Red Cross and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Afterward, they were sent to Sidon for further investigation. The ceasefire agreement stipulated that the Lebanese army would deploy in southern Lebanon alongside UN peacekeepers, while Israel would begin withdrawing its forces over a 60-day period. Hezbollah was also required to relocate its forces north of the Litani River, and dismantle its military infrastructure in the south. In the meantime, the Israeli army claimed to have located and destroyed a combat compound in southern Lebanon containing several weapons storage facilities. Despite the ceasefire, Israel has continued to carry out military actions, including bombings in the towns of Kfar Kila and Bint Jbeil, leading to condemnation from Lebanese media regarding repeated attacks on southern villages.The post Israel Frees 7 Civilians Detained in South Lebanon After Truce first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-frees-7-civilians-south-lebanon-truce/	2024-12-23T04:03:04-08:00	
Mikati Tours Military Positions in South Lebanon	Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati has initiated a visit to military positions in southern Lebanon, nearly a month after a ceasefire agreement ended the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. This marks Mikati's first trip to the southern frontlines, where, as per the U.S.-mediated deal, Lebanese troops are set to gradually deploy. Both Hezbollah fighters and Israeli forces are expected to pull back by the end of next month. Mikati's tour follows ongoing frustration from the Lebanese government over Israeli airstrikes and overflights. After meeting with Lebanese Army Commander Joseph Aoun at a military base in Marjayoun, Mikati emphasized the tasks ahead. He stressed the importance of ensuring Israel’s withdrawal from the territories it had occupied during its recent military actions, stating that this would enable the Lebanese army to fully carry out its duties. The Lebanese military has long depended on foreign aid, particularly from the U.S. and other Western nations, to maintain its operations. With the conflict’s conclusion and the ceasefire in place, Lebanon hopes that additional funding will bolster the army’s capacity to establish a stronger presence in the south, where Hezbollah’s armed units had been active. Despite not directly engaging in combat, numerous Lebanese soldiers were killed in Israeli airstrikes targeting their positions or patrols in the region.The post Mikati Tours Military Positions in South Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/mikati-tours-military-positions-in-south-lebanon/	2024-12-23T04:02:54-08:00	
Iran’s Khamenei Predicts Syrian Youth Will Resist New Government	Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has expressed confidence that young Syrians will resist the new government following the fall of Bashar al-Assad. He pointed out that these young individuals, who now face instability after Assad's ousting, have 'nothing to lose' and are likely to resist the new order. Khamenei emphasized that these Syrians should stand firm against those he believes are responsible for the insecurity in the country. He reiterated accusations that the U.S. and Israel were behind the instability in Syria, claiming they aimed to exploit the country’s resources. Iran has been a key supporter of Assad’s regime during Syria's civil war, which began after Assad's violent crackdown on protests. Syria has also served as a critical route for Iranian support to Hezbollah. Khamenei's remarks came after a year of significant losses for Iran's regional allies, including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, which was forced to agree to a ceasefire after heavy Israeli strikes. Despite the setbacks, Khamenei denied that groups like Hezbollah and Hamas act as Iranian proxies, asserting that these groups fight due to their own convictions. He further stated that if Iran ever needed to take action, it would not rely on proxy forces.The post Iran’s Khamenei Predicts Syrian Youth Will Resist New Government first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/irans-khamenei-syrian-youth-resist-new-government/	2024-12-23T04:02:33-08:00	
Khamenei Denies Having or Needing Regional Proxy Forces	Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei rejected claims that militant groups in the region act as Tehran's proxies, stating that if Iran needed to take action, it would not rely on them. His comments came amid significant losses for Iran-backed groups such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, both of which faced defeats in their ongoing conflicts with Israel. Additionally, the fall of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, a key ally in Iran’s so-called axis of resistance, added to the regional shifts. Khamenei insisted that groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, and Yemen's Houthi rebels are motivated by their own beliefs, not by Iran's influence. He emphasized that these groups fight because of their faith, not as part of a proxy network for Tehran. Khamenei further dismissed American claims that Iran had lost control over its regional proxies, asserting that Iran would not need proxy forces if it chose to take action. The collapse of Assad’s regime earlier this month marked a significant shift in the regional balance, as Assad had long been a key partner for Iran, especially in supporting Hezbollah. Khamenei expressed confidence that Syria would soon see the rise of a strong, independent group of fighters, predicting that Syria’s youth, who have nothing to lose, would form this group. He also accused the United States of attempting to destabilize Iran, promising that the Iranian people would reject any foreign influence or attempts to interfere with their sovereignty.The post Khamenei Denies Having or Needing Regional Proxy Forces first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/khamenei-denies-needing-proxy-forces/	2024-12-23T04:02:25-08:00	
Ex-Israeli Spies Reveal Hezbollah Pager Attack Details	Two recently retired senior Israeli intelligence officers revealed new details about a covert operation targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria, which utilized explosive devices hidden in pagers and walkie-talkies. The operation, years in the making, was carried out three months ago and was revealed in a segment on CBS’s '60 Minutes.' The operation began over a decade ago with walkie-talkies laced with explosives, which Hezbollah unwittingly purchased from Israel. The walkie-talkies weren’t detonated until September, a day after the pagers, which had been rigged to explode, were triggered. The explosive devices were part of a larger plan to strike Hezbollah militants. In 2022, Mossad learned that Hezbollah was acquiring pagers from a Taiwanese company and decided to turn the situation to their advantage. The pagers were altered to accommodate explosives and tested to ensure they would cause harm only to the target while minimizing risk to bystanders. Mossad also experimented with various ringtones to ensure the pagers would be noticed. The operation also involved deceiving Hezbollah into thinking it was purchasing equipment from legitimate suppliers, using false ads and shell companies to mislead the Taiwanese firm. The pagers were marketed as rugged and efficient, convincing Hezbollah to buy a new, larger model with hidden explosives. By September, Hezbollah had acquired thousands of these altered pagers. The explosive devices were detonated on September 17, causing widespread panic. The following day, Mossad activated the walkie-talkies, some of which exploded during funerals for victims of the pager explosions. The explosions were intended to send a powerful message to Hezbollah, demonstrating Israel’s technological superiority and the cost of challenging Israel. The explosions caused significant psychological impact in Lebanon, with people fearing further attacks from everyday objects. Israel’s air strikes soon followed, leading to heavy casualties, including the assassination of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. The operation concluded with a ceasefire by November. The Israeli agents behind the operation explained that the aim was not just to kill but to cripple Hezbollah, creating visible, long-lasting reminders of Israel’s power in the region. The fear instilled in the population, they explained, was part of the psychological warfare that Israel hoped to maintain as a deterrent.The post Ex-Israeli Spies Reveal Hezbollah Pager Attack Details first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/ex-israeli-spies-hezbollah-pager-attack-details/	2024-12-23T04:02:10-08:00
