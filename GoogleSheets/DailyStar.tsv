Israel considered striking Nasrallah’s funeral, says Halevi	Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) Chief Herzi Halevi recently suggested that the military considered targeting the funeral of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Addressing cadets at the 1st Infantry Division, Halevi mentioned deliberations about the event, implying a potential attack was under discussion. During Nasrallah's funeral in Beirut, Israeli warplanes conducted low-altitude flyovers, causing a significant disturbance among the tens of thousands of mourners gathered at the Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium. This act was intended as a show of force, with Defense Minister Israel Katz stating that the flyover served as a clear message to those threatening Israel. Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike in September, which also claimed the lives of several Hezbollah officials and a senior Iranian general. His successor, Hashem Safieddine, met a similar fate shortly after assuming leadership. The recent funeral underscored the ongoing tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, with both sides exchanging threats and demonstrating military capabilities.The post Israel considered striking Nasrallah’s funeral, says Halevi first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-considered-striking-nasrallahs-funeral-halevi/	2025-02-27T11:10:12-08:00	
Hamas says it’s ready to negotiate next phase of Gaza ceasefire	Hamas has expressed its readiness to enter discussions for the next phase of the Gaza ceasefire, following a significant prisoner exchange. In this recent exchange, Hamas handed over the remains of four Israeli hostages in return for the release of over 600 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli custody. This marks the completion of the initial phase of the truce, which commenced on January 19, 2025. The hostages returned to Israel were noted to have been killed either during their captivity or in the course of Hamas's initial attack on October 7, 2023, which ignited the ongoing conflict. The current ceasefire aims to bring an end to the war that has severely impacted Gaza. Public pressure within Israel is mounting to extend the ceasefire to facilitate the release of the remaining 59 hostages, though it is believed that fewer than half are still alive. The successful conclusion of the first phase, mediated by Egypt, saw the liberation of 620 Palestinians, including individuals previously sentenced to life for attacks on Israelis. Hamas has emphasized its commitment to the agreement and indicated that further negotiations are contingent upon Israel's adherence to the terms. In a related development, an Israeli official has stated that the military will maintain its presence in the Philadelphi Corridor along the Gaza-Egypt border, despite stipulations in the ceasefire agreement calling for withdrawal. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, cited the necessity of preventing weapons smuggling as the rationale for retaining control over this strategic area. This stance could potentially lead to tensions with Hamas and Egypt, the latter having played a pivotal role in mediating the ceasefire and advocating for Israel's withdrawal from the corridor. The initial phase of the ceasefire is set to conclude this weekend, with subsequent negotiations yet to commence. The war, which erupted in October 2023 following a Hamas attack on Israel, has resulted in substantial casualties and widespread destruction in Gaza. The ceasefire agreement, brokered by Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin al-Thani, includes a 42-day truce, followed by phased negotiations aimed at the release of remaining hostages and the establishment of a permanent ceasefire. Further discussions are scheduled to take place in Cairo to address the implementation of the agreement. Both U.S. President Joe Biden and newly re-elected President Donald Trump have expressed support for the deal.The post Hamas says it’s ready to negotiate next phase of Gaza ceasefire first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hamas-ready-negotiate-next-phase-gaza-ceasefire/	2025-02-27T11:10:04-08:00	
Witkoff: Lebanon and Syria could join Abraham Accords	U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, has expressed optimism about the potential inclusion of Saudi Arabia in the Abraham Accords, a series of normalization agreements between Israel and Arab nations brokered during Trump's first term. Witkoff believes that such a development could pave the way for broader regional peace, suggesting that countries like Lebanon and Syria might also consider normalizing relations with Israel following recent setbacks faced by Iran-backed forces in those nations. In a recent interview, Witkoff emphasized the transformative impact of normalization, stating that it represents 'the beginning of the end of war' in the region. He highlighted that a ceasefire in Gaza is a crucial precondition for expanding the Abraham Accords, as stability would make the region more attractive for investment and reduce the threat of attacks from groups like Hezbollah and Hamas. Witkoff's diplomatic efforts have included meetings with key regional leaders. He recently traveled to Saudi Arabia to discuss potential normalization agreements with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Following this, he visited Israel to engage with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, focusing on advancing the next phase of the ceasefire with Hamas and exploring opportunities to broaden the scope of the Abraham Accords.The post Witkoff: Lebanon and Syria could join Abraham Accords first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/witkoff-lebanon-syria-could-join-abraham-accords/	2025-02-26T09:43:48-08:00	
Israeli general says security stable for northerners to return	Major General Uri Gordin, head of Israel's Northern Command, has informed local leaders near the Lebanese border that the current security conditions permit evacuated residents to return to their communities. He also announced plans to reopen tourist sites in northern Israel by early March. Approximately 60,000 Israelis were evacuated from border areas during the 14-month conflict with Hezbollah. Although a fragile ceasefire has been in place, both sides have reported violations. Israel continues to maintain forces on five strategic Lebanese hills overlooking both southern Lebanon and northern Israel. Despite the evacuation orders being lifted, most displaced residents have yet to return home. The conflict, which began on October 8, 2023, following Hezbollah's rocket attacks a day after a deadly Hamas assault on Israel, led to the evacuation of numerous border settlements. The war resulted in significant casualties and displacement on both sides. In Lebanon, over 1 million people were displaced, with reconstruction efforts expected to take years, especially in southern towns that suffered extensive damage. Hezbollah's rocket attacks claimed the lives of 77 individuals in Israel, more than half of whom were civilians. Israeli air and ground operations led to over 4,000 deaths in Lebanon, predominantly among civilians. The Israeli government has prioritized the return of displaced residents and is offering incentives to encourage them to return to their homes. However, the repatriation process has been slow, partly due to residents' concerns about safety and the substantial rehabilitation needed in affected communities. The prolonged conflict has also had a profound economic impact. A recent survey indicates that one-fifth of Israelis who evacuated their homes have lost their jobs. The displaced population, primarily from areas near Gaza and the Lebanese border, faced extended stays in temporary accommodations, leading to job losses and reduced household incomes. The Israeli economy experienced minimal growth in 2024, partly due to increased defense spending and labor shortages in critical sectors.The post Israeli general says security stable for northerners to return first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-general-security-stable-northerners-return/	2025-02-26T09:43:40-08:00	
How many hostages remain in Gaza?	On Saturday, Hamas released six Israeli hostages, marking the final scheduled release of living captives under the current phase of a ceasefire agreement with Israel. This phase has seen the liberation of 33 Israelis, including eight deceased individuals, and five Thai nationals. Despite these releases, 63 hostages, among them the remains of a soldier held since 2014, remain in Gaza. The transfer of four Israeli hostages' remains was marred by an incident where Hamas handed over the incorrect body for Shiri Bibas, an Israeli mother abducted alongside her two young sons. After a tense standoff, her correct remains were returned and identified early Saturday. The final four sets of remains are expected to be returned in the coming days. The initial abduction of 251 individuals by Hamas-led militants occurred during the October 7, 2023, attack, which ignited the ongoing conflict. The ensuing war has resulted in over 48,000 Palestinian deaths in Gaza, predominantly women and children, as reported by Gaza's Health Ministry. It's important to note that these figures do not differentiate between civilians and combatants. In exchange for the hostages, Israel is releasing nearly 2,000 prisoners and detainees during this first phase of the ceasefire. As of now, 141 hostages have been released through exchanges or other agreements, including four deceased individuals. Sixty-two hostages remain in captivity, with Israel declaring 35 of them deceased. Among the captives are 13 soldiers, seven of whom have been declared dead by Israeli authorities. Additionally, Israeli troops have retrieved the bodies of 40 hostages and rescued eight alive. Non-Israeli captives still held include five individuals—three Thai nationals, one Nepalese, and one Tanzanian—of whom two are believed to be alive. Separately, two hostages held prior to October 7, 2023, have been released. Israel has also recovered the body of a soldier held in Gaza since his death in the 2014 Israel-Hamas war, while the remains of a second soldier killed in 2014 remain in Gaza. The ceasefire agreement remains fragile, with recent delays in the release of 620 Palestinian prisoners by Israel, seeking assurances about the dignified return of its hostages. This postponement has caused distress among families awaiting reunification and poses a risk to the stability of the ceasefire. In Gaza, the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate, with at least six infants succumbing to hypothermia due to inadequate shelter amid cold weather conditions. The ongoing conflict has led to massive casualties and destruction, overshadowing moments of hope for families anticipating the return of their loved ones.The post How many hostages remain in Gaza? first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/how-many-hostages-remain-gaza/	2025-02-25T07:15:33-08:00	
Iran on ‘high alert’ over feared attack on nuclear sites	Iran has heightened the alert status of its defense systems surrounding nuclear facilities due to concerns over potential attacks from Israel and the United States. This move includes the deployment of additional air defense launchers to bolster security. Earlier this month, Iran unveiled the 'Etemad' ballistic missile, which boasts a range of 1,700 kilometers. This missile, measuring 16 meters in length and 1.25 meters in diameter, is equipped with a precision-guided warhead designed to maintain accuracy throughout its flight. The unveiling ceremony in Tehran was attended by President Masoud Pezeshkian, who emphasized that the advancement of defense capabilities aims to deter any aggression against Iranian territory. U.S. intelligence agencies have recently indicated that Israel may be planning a preemptive strike on Iran's nuclear infrastructure by midyear. This assessment follows an incident in October when Israel conducted airstrikes in Iran in response to a missile attack. In light of these developments, Iran has intensified its defensive posture to safeguard its strategic assets. In April, Iran launched a significant missile and drone assault on Israel after the deaths of two Iranian generals in an alleged Israeli airstrike in Syria. While the attack resulted in minimal damage, it marked a notable escalation in regional tensions. Israel, under international pressure to exercise restraint, conducted a limited retaliatory strike. On October 1, Iran fired approximately 180 missiles into Israel, prompting civilians to seek shelter. The assault caused minor damage and a few injuries. Israel responded with airstrikes targeting missile production facilities and air defense sites, aiming to diminish Iran's offensive capabilities.The post Iran on ‘high alert’ over feared attack on nuclear sites first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/iran-high-alert-feared-attack-nuclear-sites/	2025-02-25T07:15:25-08:00	
Israeli warplanes roar low over Beirut during Nasrallah funeral	During the funeral of Hezbollah's former leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in Beirut, Israeli warplanes conducted low-altitude flights over the city, causing sonic booms that resonated throughout the capital. This display coincided with the mass gathering of tens of thousands of mourners at the Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz stated that these flights were intended to send a 'clear message' to those threatening Israel, emphasizing that adversaries would meet a similar fate. Nasrallah, who led Hezbollah for over three decades, was killed in an Israeli airstrike nearly five months prior. His death, along with that of his cousin and designated successor, Hashem Safieddine, marked significant losses for the Iran-backed group. Despite these setbacks, Hezbollah's current leader, Naim Qassem, addressed the crowd, reaffirming the organization's resilience and commitment to resistance against Israel. The funeral drew international attendees, including delegations from Iran, Iraq, and Yemen, underscoring Hezbollah's extensive regional influence. The Israeli flyovers during the ceremony further heightened tensions, with Defense Minister Katz reiterating Israel's stance against any threats to its security.The post Israeli warplanes roar low over Beirut during Nasrallah funeral first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-warplanes-beirut-nasrallah-funeral/	2025-02-23T07:13:30-08:00	
Israel says it struck Hezbollah arms smuggling routes on Lebanon-...	On Saturday, Israeli forces conducted airstrikes along the Lebanon-Syria border, targeting routes allegedly used by Hezbollah for smuggling weapons into Lebanon. The Israeli military stated that these operations aimed to disrupt Hezbollah's efforts to rebuild its arsenal, considering such smuggling attempts a clear violation of existing ceasefire agreements between Israel and Lebanon. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the strikes focused on smuggling routes, including unauthorized crossings along the border. No immediate reports of casualties have emerged from these operations. This military action occurred just one day before the scheduled mass funeral for Hassan Nasrallah, the long-serving leader of Hezbollah, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike nearly five months prior. Nasrallah's death marked a significant setback for the Iran-backed organization, which has faced considerable challenges following last year's conflict and the loss of its ally, Bashar al-Assad, in Syria. The funeral, planned to take place at Beirut's Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium, is expected to draw hundreds of thousands of supporters, including international dignitaries and allies from the region. The event aims to showcase Hezbollah's enduring influence and resilience despite recent adversities. In the lead-up to the funeral, Lebanese state media reported Israeli aircraft flying at low altitudes over Beirut and its suburbs, coinciding with the large gatherings of mourners. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz stated that these flights served as a 'clear message' to those threatening Israel, emphasizing the potential consequences of hostile actions against the nation.The post Israel says it struck Hezbollah arms smuggling routes on Lebanon-Syria border first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-struck-hezbollah-arms-smuggling-lebanon-syria-border/	2025-02-23T07:13:23-08:00	
Thousands arrive in Beirut for Nasrallah’s funeral	Thousands of supporters have converged on Beirut to attend the funeral of Hezbollah's long-standing leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike on September 27, 2024. The funeral is scheduled for February 23, 2025, at Beirut's main sports stadium. Nasrallah, a pivotal figure in Hezbollah for over three decades, was instrumental in shaping the group into a formidable force in the Middle East. His death, resulting from an Israeli airstrike targeting Hezbollah's headquarters in Beirut's southern suburbs, has been a significant blow to the organization. In the days leading up to the funeral, flights from Iraq have been fully booked, with up to 6,000 individuals traveling to Beirut to pay their respects. Notably, American commentator Jackson Hinkle expressed his honor in attending the funeral, highlighting Nasrallah's influence beyond the Middle East. However, Lebanese authorities revoked permission for a passenger plane from Iran, leaving several mourners stranded in Tehran and prompting protests by Hezbollah supporters in Lebanon. The assassination of Nasrallah has escalated tensions in the region, with Lebanese citizens expressing shock and fear of potential all-out war. The airstrike not only claimed Nasrallah's life but also caused significant destruction in Beirut, leading to mass displacement and a heightened sense of vulnerability among residents. In response to the assassination, Yemeni Information Minister Moammar al-Eryani called for the arrest of Houthi officials attending Nasrallah's funeral, urging the Lebanese government to hand them over to Yemen's internationally recognized authorities.The post Thousands arrive in Beirut for Nasrallah’s funeral first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/thousands-arrive-beirut-nasrallahs-funeral/	2025-02-22T06:53:31-08:00	
Lebanese-American convicted of attempting to kill Rushdie	Hadi Matar, a 27-year-old from New Jersey, has been convicted of attempted murder and assault for the 2022 stabbing of author Salman Rushdie during a literary event in New York. The jury deliberated for less than two hours before delivering the verdict. Matar faces up to 25 years in prison, with sentencing scheduled for April. The attack occurred in August 2022 at the Chautauqua Institution, where Rushdie was about to speak. Matar rushed the stage and stabbed Rushdie approximately 15 times, resulting in severe injuries, including the loss of sight in his right eye, liver damage, and paralysis of his right hand. Rushdie was hospitalized for 17 days following the assault. During the trial, Rushdie provided detailed testimony about the attack and its aftermath, describing the intense pain and his belief that he was dying. Matar, who pleaded not guilty and rejected a plea deal, expressed no remorse and faces additional federal terrorism-related charges for allegedly supporting Hezbollah. The motivation for the attack is believed to be linked to a 1989 fatwa issued by Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, calling for Rushdie's death over his novel 'The Satanic Verses,' which was deemed blasphemous by some in the Muslim community. Despite assurances from Iran in 1998 that they no longer supported the fatwa, threats against Rushdie persisted.The post Lebanese-American convicted of attempting to kill Rushdie first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lebanese-american-convicted-attempting-kill-rushdie/	2025-02-22T06:53:24-08:00	
Israel strikes Hezbollah border crossings between Lebanon and Syr...	Israel has announced that its air force targeted crossing points along the Lebanon-Syria border utilized by Hezbollah for smuggling weapons into Lebanon. The Israeli military emphasized that these smuggling activities violate the existing ceasefire agreements between Israel and Lebanon. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the overnight airstrikes rendered an 'illegal crossing' near Lebanon's Wadi Khaled, adjacent to Syria's Homs province, inoperative and resulted in several injuries. The strikes occurred after a convoy of smuggler vehicles was detected moving from Syria toward Lebanon. Lebanon's National News Agency noted that Israeli aircraft were observed flying at low altitudes over Hermel city and surrounding areas in the Bekaa Valley near the Syrian border. This development follows a fragile ceasefire established on November 27, after over a year of hostilities, including two months of intense conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. Both parties have accused each other of breaching the ceasefire terms. Under the ceasefire agreement, the Lebanese military was to deploy in southern Lebanon alongside U.N. peacekeepers as Israeli forces withdrew over a 60-day period, later extended to February 18. Hezbollah was expected to retreat north of the Litani River, approximately 30 kilometers from the border, and dismantle its military infrastructure in the south. However, just before the latest deadline, Israel announced it would maintain troops in five 'strategic points' near the border. Earlier this month, the Israeli military reported conducting an airstrike on a tunnel along the Syria-Lebanon border used by Hezbollah for weapon smuggling. In January, Israeli airstrikes targeted areas in eastern and southern Lebanon, with the Israeli military stating that the operations were against Hezbollah targets, including smuggling routes along the Syrian border. The Lebanon-Syria border spans approximately 330 kilometers without official demarcation. Hezbollah, which has significant influence in regions along this border, has been actively involved in the Syrian conflict, supporting President Bashar al-Assad's forces.The post Israel strikes Hezbollah border crossings between Lebanon and Syria first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-strikes-hezbollah-border-crossings-lebanon-syria/	2025-02-21T03:38:55-08:00	
Arab leaders meet in Saudi Arabia to shape Gaza plan	Arab leaders convened in Saudi Arabia on Friday to formulate a comprehensive recovery plan for Gaza, aiming to counter President Donald Trump's controversial proposal for U.S. control over the territory and the displacement of its inhabitants. Trump's plan has unified Arab nations in opposition, yet debates persist regarding Gaza's future governance and the financing of its reconstruction. The Saudi Press Agency reported that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman extended invitations to leaders from Gulf Arab countries, Egypt, and Jordan for an informal meeting in Riyadh. This gathering seeks to strengthen fraternal relations and prepare for an emergency Arab League summit scheduled in Egypt on March 4. The primary focus is to develop a reconstruction strategy for Gaza that offers a viable alternative to Trump's proposal, which has been widely criticized for its potential to destabilize the region. Egypt is anticipated to present a detailed reconstruction plan during the Riyadh discussions. This plan is expected to outline a phased approach to rebuilding Gaza's infrastructure and economy, emphasizing the importance of Palestinian self-governance and regional cooperation. However, significant challenges remain, particularly concerning the mobilization of financial resources and the establishment of a stable governance framework in the post-war period. The urgency of these discussions is heightened by the extensive devastation in Gaza following prolonged conflict. The United Nations estimates that reconstruction efforts will require substantial investment, with figures potentially reaching into the tens of billions of dollars. The international community, alongside regional stakeholders, faces the critical task of ensuring that reconstruction efforts are inclusive, sustainable, and respectful of the rights and aspirations of the Palestinian people.The post Arab leaders meet in Saudi Arabia to shape Gaza plan first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/arab-leaders-meet-saudi-arabia-shape-gaza-plan/	2025-02-21T03:38:47-08:00

On February 20, 2025, Hamas returned the bodies of four Israeli hostages, including mother Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir, who were abducted during the October 7, 2023, attack. The remains were handed over in a somber ceremony in Khan Younis, Gaza, where Hamas displayed the coffins before transferring them to the Red Cross for delivery to Israeli authorities. The fourth body was that of 85-year-old Oded Lifshitz, a peace activist from Nir Oz kibbutz. The Bibas family had been taken from their home in Nir Oz during the October attack. Shiri's husband, Yarden, was also abducted but was released earlier this month. The return of their bodies has been a deeply painful moment for Israel, with President Isaac Herzog expressing profound sorrow and seeking forgiveness for not being able to protect them. This handover is part of a fragile ceasefire agreement that has seen the release of several hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. However, the situation remains tense, with ongoing negotiations and uncertainty about the future of the ceasefire. The conflict has resulted in significant loss of life and widespread devastation in Gaza.The post Hamas returns bodies of four Israeli hostages, including mother and two children first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hamas-returns-bodies-israeli-hostages-mother-children/	2025-02-20T09:05:59-08:00	
Arab leaders unite to challenge Trump’s Gaza plan	Reacting to the proposal by US President Donald Trump to consider putting the Gaza Strip under America's control, expelling its residents, Arab leaders are meeting in Saudi Arabia to devise an alternative plan. The Arab leaders summit will take place tomorrow in Riyadh with leaders from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, Egypt, Jordan, and the Palestinian Authority. Their aim is to work on a rebuilding plan for Gaza which shall retain the population but is to exclude Hamas from being part of the running government. Trump's plan, announced earlier this month, suggests relocating approximately 2 million Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring countries and redeveloping the area into a 'Riviera of the Middle East.' This proposal has been met with widespread condemnation from Arab nations and human rights organizations, who describe it as 'ethnic cleansing.' Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Jordan's King Abdullah II have both rejected the idea of resettling Palestinians within their borders. The alternative plan, primarily developed by Egypt, outlines a three-phase reconstruction process over three to five years. The initial phase focuses on immediate recovery, including debris removal and establishing temporary safe zones within Gaza. The subsequent phase involves an international conference to secure funding and rebuild essential infrastructure. The final phase aims to construct permanent housing and restore educational and healthcare services. A significant aspect of this plan is the exclusion of Hamas from any governing role in the post-reconstruction administration of Gaza. Financing is still the most acute challenge facing the Arab-led initiative. While nations like Kuwait might donate for humanitarian purposes, others like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates will be required to attach certain conditions to financial contributions. The next summit aims to resolve these financial issues and entrench a common Arab position against the U.S. proposal.The post Arab leaders unite to challenge Trump’s Gaza plan first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/arab-leaders-unite-challenge-trumps-gaza-plan/	2025-02-20T09:05:53-08:00	
Israeli officials split on Lebanon pullout as one vows more strik...	In the early hours of Monday, an Israeli airstrike targeted a vehicle in Sidon, southern Lebanon, resulting in the death of Mohammad Shahine, a Hamas military commander. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) stated that Shahine was responsible for orchestrating attacks against Israeli civilians, allegedly with Iranian support. This incident marks a significant escalation, as it's the deepest Israeli strike into Lebanon since the ceasefire began in late November. The airstrike occurred near a Lebanese army checkpoint and Sidon's municipal sports stadium. Footage from the scene showed a vehicle engulfed in flames, with emergency responders recovering a charred body. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported that an 'enemy drone' carried out the attack, which also injured two civilians. This development comes just before the February 18 deadline for Israeli forces to withdraw from southern Lebanon, as stipulated in the ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah. However, Israeli officials have indicated plans to maintain a presence at five strategic locations beyond this deadline, citing concerns over Hezbollah's continued activities and the Lebanese Army's delayed deployment in the region. Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer emphasized that the IDF would remain in these positions until Lebanon fulfills its obligations under the ceasefire agreement. Lebanese leaders, including President Joseph Aoun and parliamentary speaker Nabih Berri, have rejected Israel's intention to retain these positions, insisting on a complete withdrawal as per the agreement. Hezbollah's leader, Naim Qassem, warned that any Israeli presence beyond the deadline would be considered an occupation, urging the Lebanese government to enforce the terms of the ceasefire. The situation remains tense, with both sides accusing each other of violating the ceasefire. The international community is closely monitoring the developments, as the potential for renewed hostilities looms if the terms of the ceasefire are not fully implemented by all parties involved.The post Israeli officials split on Lebanon pullout as one vows more strikes first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-split-lebanon-pullout-one-vows-strikes/	2025-02-17T06:02:24-08:00	
Israeli drone strike targets Hamas commander in Sidon	An airstrike carried out by Israel on Monday hit a vehicle in the southern Lebanese city of Sidon, resulting in the death of one individual. The attack came just one day before the deadline for an Israeli troop withdrawal under a fragile ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah. According to a Lebanese security source, the person killed was a military unit commander affiliated with Hamas. Israeli forces later claimed responsibility for the strike, stating that Mohammad Shahine, identified as a Hamas commander, had been involved in orchestrating attacks against Israel, including launching rockets. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly interrupted his ongoing trial to approve the operation, according to Israeli media reports. The strike in Sidon marks the deepest Israeli attack inside Lebanon since the ceasefire was established in late November. Video footage circulating online captured the aftermath, showing a vehicle engulfed in flames. The attack took place near a Lebanese army checkpoint and Sidon’s municipal sports stadium. Under the ceasefire terms, Israeli troops were originally set to pull out from southern Lebanon by the end of January. However, at Israel’s request, Lebanon agreed to extend the deadline to February 18. Whether the withdrawal will be completed by Tuesday remains uncertain. Despite the ceasefire, Israel has continued airstrikes in southern and eastern Lebanon, stating that its targets are military sites containing weaponry and operational facilities.The post Israeli drone strike targets Hamas commander in Sidon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-drone-strike-hamas-commander-sidon/	2025-02-17T06:02:15-08:00	
Breaking: Lebanon blocked Iranian planes after US warnings	In retaliation for Israeli threats, Lebanon twice this week denied Iranian flights permission to land at Beirut. Lebanese officials informed Iran on Thursday that a flight already scheduled was not to depart. The action followed an Israeli threat, relayed through the United States, to bring down the plane if it tried to land in Lebanon. After consultation between the prime minister and president, the transport and public works ministry withheld permission for the flight before takeoff. This withholding was also performed on Friday, leading to Hezbollah supporters' protests that resulted in the closure of Beirut's international airport road. Prime Minister Nawaf Salam emphasized that the safety of travelers and security of the airport are a priority. Israel charged that Hezbollah had smuggled arms from Iran into Lebanon via Beirut airport, a claim both Hezbollah and Lebanese officials refuted. Since November 27, there has been a precarious ceasefire, following months of Israeli-Hezbollah hostilities.The post Breaking: Lebanon blocked Iranian planes after US warnings first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lebanon-blocked-iranian-planes-us-warnings/	2025-02-16T04:21:48-08:00	
Israel receives shipment of heavy US bombs	A shipment of United States-made bombs overnighted into Israel has arrived, Israel's defense ministry reported, as Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited the country for the first time. The shipment, consisting of MK-84 heavy aerial bombs, had only been cleared by President Donald Trump's administration. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz has termed the shipment a strategic asset for the Israeli Air Force and the entire military, affirming the United States' and Israel's strong alliance. The Trump administration previously greenlighted a package of military equipment valued at over $7.4 billion, including missiles and bombs and other military equipment, to enhance Israel's defense system and counter regional threats. The delivery follows weeks of intense clashes between Israel and Hamas after Hamas' massive October 2023 attack. The war severely damaged Gaza, leaving much of its 2.4 million people displaced. Since January 19, there has been a ceasefire deal that facilitated the release of hostages captured by Hamas. The Biden administration had previously withheld a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel due to civilian casualties in Gaza. Trump later, though, overturned this decision after assuming office and cleared the release of the weapons. Rubio during his visit will most probably have a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials. Talks during his meetings are bound to touch on the Gaza ceasefire and the controversial plan put forward by Trump of relocating Palestinians out of Gaza and settling them in Egypt and Jordan, which had severe international backlash.The post Israel receives shipment of heavy US bombs first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-receives-shipment-heavy-us-bombs/	2025-02-16T04:21:41-08:00	
Lebanon calls emergency security meeting after UNIFIL protest att...	Lebanese officials are convening an emergency session following an assault on a United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) convoy near Beirut's airport, which resulted in injuries to the outgoing deputy force commander, Major General Chok Bahadur Dhakal. The incident occurred amid protests by Hezbollah supporters against the Lebanese government's decision to deny landing rights to two Iranian aircraft, a move perceived as succumbing to Israeli allegations of Iran funneling funds to Hezbollah via civilian flights. UNIFIL reported that during the Friday night attack, one of its vehicles was set ablaze, leading to Major General Dhakal's injuries as he was en route home after completing his mission. The peacekeeping force has called for a thorough and swift investigation by Lebanese authorities to ensure those responsible are held accountable. The Lebanese Army has committed to taking decisive measures against the perpetrators and has announced an emergency meeting of the Central Internal Security Council to address the situation. Interior Minister Ahmad al-Hajjar, after visiting the injured UNIFIL officers in the hospital, reiterated the government's condemnation of the attack. UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, labeled the assault as unacceptable, emphasizing that such violence jeopardizes the safety of UN personnel dedicated to maintaining Lebanon's stability. Prime Minister Nawaf Salam also denounced the attack, pledging to apprehend those involved. The Lebanese Army reported that areas surrounding the airport have experienced demonstrations characterized by vandalism and clashes, including assaults on military personnel and damage to vehicles. Footage circulating on social media depicts protesters, some masked and bearing Hezbollah flags, attacking individuals near the torched UNIFIL vehicle. This unrest follows Lebanon's revocation of landing permissions for Iranian flights, a decision influenced by Israeli claims that Iran is using civilian aircraft to smuggle funds to Hezbollah. In retaliation, Iran has barred Lebanese planes from repatriating citizens stranded in Iran, escalating tensions between the two nations. The ceasefire agreement, effective since November 27, stipulates that the Lebanese military deploys in the south alongside UN peacekeepers as the Israeli army withdraws over a designated period, recently extended to February 18. A senior Israeli security official confirmed readiness to transfer control of these areas to the Lebanese Army within the agreed timeline. Hezbollah, expected to vacate its southern positions near the Israeli border during this period, has distanced itself from the attack on the UNIFIL convoy. The situation remains volatile, with international stakeholders closely monitoring developments to prevent further escalation.The post Lebanon calls emergency security meeting after UNIFIL protest attack first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lebanon-security-meeting-unifil-attack/	2025-02-15T08:34:00-08:00	
Saudi Arabia to host Arab summit on Trump’s Gaza plan	Saudi Arabia is set to host a high-level summit on February 20, bringing together the leaders of four key Arab nations to discuss the controversial proposal put forward by U.S. President Donald Trump regarding the future of Gaza. The meeting will include the heads of state from Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, with discussions expected to focus on Trump’s suggestion of a U.S.-controlled Gaza and the forced relocation of its Palestinian population. A source familiar with the summit’s preparations indicated that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is also slated to attend. The summit comes ahead of an Arab League gathering in Cairo, where regional leaders will further deliberate on the matter. Trump’s proposal, which has drawn widespread condemnation, involves the United States assuming control over Gaza and relocating over two million Palestinians from the war-ravaged enclave. His suggestion cited Egypt and Jordan as potential resettlement destinations, an idea that has been met with fierce resistance across the Arab world. The U.S. president unveiled this plan during Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s recent visit to Washington. However, the prospect of mass displacement has triggered strong reactions, with Arab nations uniting in opposition. For Palestinians, such a move evokes painful memories of the Nakba, the mass expulsion that accompanied Israel’s establishment in 1948. In response to the backlash, Trump has reportedly hinted at cutting financial aid to Egypt and Jordan if they refuse to comply with his plan. Jordan, already home to over two million Palestinian refugees, faces growing pressure as half of its 11 million residents are of Palestinian descent. Egypt, in contrast, has proposed an alternative plan centered on Gaza’s reconstruction while ensuring that Palestinians remain in their homeland. The Egyptian initiative underscores a broader regional consensus against forced displacement and seeks a sustainable resolution that safeguards Palestinian rights. The Only Plan on the Table? U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized on Thursday that Washington is open to considering alternative proposals from Arab governments regarding Gaza’s future. However, he acknowledged that, as of now, the Trump plan remains the only official proposal. In January, former Secretary of State Antony Blinken outlined a roadmap for Gaza’s post-war governance, suggesting that any long-term solution must include a clear path toward Palestinian statehood—a condition that Israel vehemently opposes. Regional powers, including Saudi Arabia, have consistently advocated for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state coexisting with Israel. U.S. Diplomatic Push and Global Engagement Rubio departed on Friday for a diplomatic tour that includes stops in Europe and the Middle East. His itinerary features a crucial meeting at the Munich Security Conference, where he will join U.S. Vice President JD Vance in discussions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The U.S. delegation’s European visit follows a surprise phone call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, during which Trump expressed his intent to broker peace negotiations to end the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. After the Munich summit, Rubio is scheduled to visit Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE to assess the fragile ceasefire in Gaza, which has been in effect since January 19. This truce remains tenuous, with both Israel and Hamas accusing each other of violations. Following his call with Putin, Trump hinted that their first in-person meeting could take place in Saudi Arabia, further highlighting Riyadh’s growing influence on global diplomatic affairs. Saudi Arabia’s Strategic Role Saudi Arabia, which has recently positioned itself as a central player in Middle Eastern diplomacy, officially welcomed the opportunity to host the summit. However, it has yet to confirm whether the meeting will proceed as planned. Analysts suggest that Saudi Arabia aims to reinforce its standing as a key mediator in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Riyadh also seeks to demonstrate solidarity with Egypt and Jordan, both of which are under increasing pressure due to Trump’s proposal. Some experts believe the kingdom could offer economic support to these nations in case the U.S. withdraws financial aid as a punitive measure. Saudi political analyst Suleiman Aloqeliy noted that the upcoming summit will likely focus on crafting an Arab-led alternative to forced displacement while establishing clear guidelines for regional engagement on the issue. With Qatar and Egypt already acting as mediators in the Gaza conflict, this summit could serve as a stepping stone toward forging a unified Arab stance. According to regional affairs expert Umar Karim, the gathering aims to consolidate support among Arab nations and present a collective front against forced displacement policies.The post Saudi Arabia to host Arab summit on Trump’s Gaza plan first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/saudi-arabia-host-arab-summit-trumps-gaza-plan/	2025-02-15T08:33:54-08:00
