Doha rejects Israeli claim linking Qatari aid to October 7 attack	Qatar has rejected accusations made by Israel’s domestic security agency, Shin Bet, which alleged that financial aid from Qatar contributed to the strengthening of Hamas’s military capabilities ahead of the October 7, 2023 attack. Qatar dismissed these claims as false and described them as politically motivated attempts to deflect blame. The statement from Qatar’s International Media Office accused Israeli authorities of using the allegations for political cover within Israel, particularly after Shin Bet released an internal review acknowledging its own failures in preventing the large-scale cross-border assault. That attack, launched from Gaza into southern Israel, triggered more than a year of devastating conflict in the Palestinian territory. In its internal review, Shin Bet highlighted what it called the influx of Qatari funds as a significant factor that enabled Hamas to enhance its military strength, which ultimately made the October 7 attack possible. Qatar firmly denied the claim, saying that all financial aid it provided to Gaza was transferred with the full knowledge, approval, and oversight of both the current and previous Israeli governments, as well as their security agencies, including Shin Bet. Qatar emphasized that none of its financial assistance was ever delivered to Hamas’s political leadership or its military wing. Since 2012, Qatar has hosted Hamas’s political office in Doha with the approval of the United States, a role that has drawn criticism from some quarters, despite Qatar’s repeated denials that it supports the group’s armed activities. The Gulf state has played a central role as a mediator in ceasefire talks between Hamas and Israel, working alongside the United States and Egypt. Qatar’s mediation efforts were crucial in establishing a fragile truce that held for several weeks, allowing for exchanges of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. However, following the conclusion of the truce’s initial phase, the process has reached a deadlock, with both sides unable to agree on terms for extending the calm. Qatar’s statement called on Israeli security services to prioritize the safe return of the remaining hostages and work toward long-term regional stability, instead of making what it described as baseless allegations designed to distract from Israel’s own failings. Qatar reiterated that accusations linking its aid to Hamas were completely unfounded and argued that such claims only serve to prolong the ongoing conflict. The October 7 assault by Hamas led to the deaths of 1,218 people, the majority of them civilians. In response, Israel’s sustained military campaign in Gaza has resulted in the deaths of at least 48,405 people, with most of those killed also believed to be civilians, according to figures from both sides.The post Doha rejects Israeli claim linking Qatari aid to October 7 attack first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/doha-rejects-israeli-claim-qatari-october-7/	2025-03-05T08:16:09-08:00	
Israel’s mission against Hamas unfinished, says new military chie...	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with Israel’s new military chief, Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir, to mark the official handover of command at the Israel Defense Forces headquarters in Tel Aviv. During the ceremony, Netanyahu stressed that Israel remains fully committed to securing victory in the ongoing multi-front conflict, which erupted following Hamas’s large-scale attack in October 2023. Netanyahu made it clear that Zamir will play a crucial role in shaping the outcome of the war, noting that the decisions made and actions taken now will have long-lasting effects on the future security and stability of the country. In his first remarks after assuming his new role, Zamir acknowledged the damage inflicted on Hamas during months of military operations but admitted that the group has not yet been fully neutralized. He described defeating Hamas as a mission still underway and said that eliminating the threat posed by the group remains a top priority for the Israeli military. The leadership transition comes at a particularly sensitive time, with negotiations over a potential second phase of the fragile ceasefire with Hamas remaining deadlocked. Tensions between both sides continue to simmer, with Israel demanding the complete disarmament of Hamas and the release of all hostages still held in Gaza before agreeing to any long-term truce. Zamir, who now serves as the IDF’s 24th Chief of Staff, brings decades of military experience to the role. Having first joined the Armored Corps in the mid-1980s, he rose steadily through the ranks, holding senior command roles including leadership of the Southern Command — the area responsible for security along the Gaza border. Most recently, he served as Director-General of the Ministry of Defense, giving him experience working at the highest levels of Israel’s security and defense infrastructure. His appointment is taking place in the shadow of internal reviews conducted after the October 2023 attack, which exposed severe intelligence and operational failures that left southern Israel vulnerable. While Hamas’s initial assault triggered a devastating Israeli response, including sustained airstrikes and ground operations in Gaza, the group has continued to maintain pockets of resistance, and several hostages remain in captivity. During the ceremony, Netanyahu expressed full confidence in Zamir’s leadership abilities, citing their previous work together and praising his operational expertise and deep understanding of Israel’s security landscape. The Prime Minister said that under Zamir’s command, the military would continue to adapt to evolving threats while also seizing strategic opportunities to strengthen Israel’s position both regionally and internationally. As Zamir takes charge, the military faces the dual challenge of ensuring operational success on the ground while also managing mounting international scrutiny over Israel’s conduct during the conflict. Allegations of war crimes and humanitarian violations have been raised by international bodies, adding further complexity to the military’s ongoing operations. The months ahead will test Zamir’s leadership as the Israeli military attempts to balance the immediate need to protect its citizens with long-term efforts to reshape the security environment in Gaza and across the wider region.The post Israel’s mission against Hamas unfinished, says new military chief first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israels-mission-hamas-unfinished-new-military-chief/	2025-03-05T08:16:00-08:00	
Egypt unveils $53bn Gaza rebuild plan as Arab leaders gather in C...	Egypt has unveiled a comprehensive $53 billion initiative to reconstruct the Gaza Strip over a five-year period, focusing on immediate relief, infrastructure rehabilitation, and sustainable economic growth. This proposal is set to be deliberated at an extraordinary Arab summit in Cairo, presenting a stark alternative to U.S. President Donald Trump's recent suggestion to assume control of Gaza and relocate its Palestinian inhabitants to neighboring countries such as Egypt and Jordan. Phased Reconstruction Strategy The Egyptian plan is structured into two primary phases: an early recovery phase and a subsequent reconstruction phase. Early Recovery Phase: Spanning six months with an estimated budget of $3 billion, this phase aims to address immediate needs by removing unexploded ordnance, clearing debris, and providing temporary housing solutions. To accommodate the displaced population, the plan proposes establishing seven designated sites within Gaza, offering temporary housing units for over 1.5 million individuals, with each unit designed for an average of six occupants. Additionally, initial repairs are planned for 60,000 partially damaged homes, potentially benefiting around 360,000 residents. Reconstruction Phase: This phase is divided into two stages over four and a half years. First Stage (until 2027): With a projected cost of $20 billion, efforts will focus on rebuilding essential infrastructure, including roads, utility networks, and public service facilities. The construction of 200,000 permanent housing units is planned to accommodate approximately 1.6 million people, alongside the reclamation of 20,000 acres of land. Second Stage (until 2030): An estimated $30 billion investment will be directed towards completing infrastructure projects, constructing an additional 200,000 housing units, and developing industrial zones, a fishing port, a commercial seaport, and an airport. Funding Mechanisms To ensure efficient and transparent funding, the proposal suggests the creation of an internationally supervised trust fund. Egypt also plans to host a high-level ministerial conference, bringing together donor countries, international and regional financial institutions, the private sector, and civil society organizations to secure the necessary financial support. Governance and Security Provisions The plan recommends forming a Gaza administration committee composed of independent technocrats and non-partisan figures under the Palestinian government, managing the territory for a transitional period of six months. This approach aims to facilitate the Palestinian Authority's full resumption of control. Egypt and Jordan are reportedly training Palestinian security forces to assume law enforcement responsibilities in Gaza, with calls for international and regional support to fund this initiative. The proposal also considers the potential deployment of international peacekeeping or protection forces in Gaza and the West Bank, as part of a broader strategy leading to the establishment of a Palestinian state. Regional and International Responses President Trump's proposal to depopulate Gaza and transform it into a tourist destination has been met with widespread condemnation from Palestinians, Arab states, and various international partners, who reject any efforts to expel Gazans. In contrast, Egypt's reconstruction plan emphasizes maintaining Gaza's population, aligning with regional sentiments and international law.The post Egypt unveils $53bn Gaza rebuild plan as Arab leaders gather in Cairo first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/egypt-53bn-gaza-rebuild-plan-arab-leaders-cairo/	2025-03-04T08:01:34-08:00	
Israel demands full demilitarization in next phase of Gaza truce	Israel's Foreign Minister, Gideon Saar, announced on Tuesday that the country requires the complete demilitarization of Gaza and the removal of Hamas before advancing to the second phase of the January ceasefire agreement. He emphasized that without these conditions, no progress can be made in the ceasefire process. Saar also expressed concerns that humanitarian aid has become a significant revenue source for Hamas, suggesting that the group utilizes these funds to bolster their militant activities. In response, Hamas leader Sami Abu Zuhri firmly stated that disarmament is a non-negotiable issue for both Hamas and other Palestinian factions, indicating that any discussions involving the resistance's weapons are unacceptable.The post Israel demands full demilitarization in next phase of Gaza truce first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-full-demilitarization-phase-gaza-truce/	2025-03-04T08:01:18-08:00	
With Gaza ceasefire stalled, Israel pushes new plan on Hamas	Israel has introduced a new U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal, referred to as the 'Witkoff proposal,' aiming to pressure Hamas into compliance by imposing a siege on the Gaza Strip. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attributed this plan to U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, though official confirmation from the White House remains pending. This development follows the conclusion of the first phase of a previously negotiated ceasefire, with uncertainty looming over subsequent steps due to the absence of a finalized second phase. The new proposal stipulates that Hamas release half of its remaining hostages in exchange for an extension of the ceasefire and a commitment to negotiate a permanent truce. Notably, this plan does not include provisions for Israel to release additional Palestinian prisoners, a significant element of the initial agreement. Hamas has accused Israel of attempting to undermine the existing agreement, which outlined negotiations for the return of all hostages in exchange for further Palestinian prisoner releases, a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and a lasting ceasefire. However, substantive negotiations on these terms have yet to occur. In response to Hamas's reluctance to accept the new proposal, Israel has halted all supplies, including food, fuel, and medicine, to Gaza's approximately 2 million residents and has warned of additional consequences if Hamas does not comply. Concurrently, Arab leaders are formulating an alternative plan for postwar Gaza, aiming to counter President Trump's controversial suggestion of relocating Gaza's population to transform the area into a tourist destination. The Egyptian proposal envisions Gaza being governed by an interim body controlled by Arab, Muslim, and Western states, effectively sidelining Hamas. This plan is expected to be presented at an upcoming Arab League summit. The original ceasefire agreement, reached in January after extensive negotiations mediated by the United States, Egypt, and Qatar, outlined a three-phase plan to secure the release of hostages taken by Hamas on October 7, 2023, and to end the ensuing conflict. During the initial six-week phase, Hamas released 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight others in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces withdrew from most of Gaza, allowing for an influx of humanitarian aid, despite mutual accusations of violations. citeturn0news33 The second phase presents greater challenges, as it requires Israel to balance its objectives of securing the return of hostages and dismantling Hamas. Hamas has stated it will only release the remaining hostages if Israel ends the war, a move that could leave the militant group with significant influence over Gaza, even if it relinquishes formal power. Under the Witkoff proposal, Hamas would release half of the remaining hostages on the first day, seemingly without receiving any new concessions. This would initiate a six-week period, encompassing the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the Jewish Passover, to negotiate a permanent ceasefire and the return of the remaining hostages. However, with fewer hostages as leverage, Hamas's negotiating position would be weakened, and Israel, along with the United States, is already discussing new conditions, such as the disarmament of Hamas or the exile of its leadership, which were not part of the original agreement. Politically, this plan provides Netanyahu with a six-week reprieve, allowing time to pass a budget by month's end, a necessary step to prevent his government's automatic dissolution. Failure to do so could trigger early elections, potentially jeopardizing his hold on power. Opposition parties have indicated they would support a deal that ensures the return of the remaining hostages, though this could still weaken Netanyahu's political standing. The U.S. stance on the new proposal remains ambiguous. While Netanyahu asserts that his approach is fully coordinated with the Trump administration, which has publicly endorsed Israel's goal of eradicating Hamas, envoy Steve Witkoff has not publicly commented on the plan attributed to him. President Trump has sent mixed signals regarding Gaza, expressing a desire to end Middle East conflicts while also condemning Hamas's treatment of captives and suggesting severe repercussions if they are not released promptly, leaving the final decision to Israel.The post With Gaza ceasefire stalled, Israel pushes new plan on Hamas first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/gaza-ceasefire-stalled-israel-new-plan-hamas/	2025-03-03T11:41:31-08:00	
Israel orders army to defend Druze community near Damascus	Israel's defense ministry has directed the military to prepare for the defense of the Druze community in Jaramana, a suburb of Damascus, in response to reported attacks by Syrian forces. This directive, issued by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz, underscores Israel's commitment to protecting the Druze minority in the region. The situation escalated following clashes in Jaramana, where a confrontation between local gunmen and Syrian security forces resulted in casualties. This unrest has raised concerns about the safety of the Druze population amid Syria's ongoing efforts to reassert control after years of civil conflict. In a related development, prominent Lebanese Druze leader Walid Jumblatt announced plans to visit Syria to meet with the interim leadership. Jumblatt has accused Israel of exacerbating sectarian tensions and has called for the protection of the Druze community. Israel has also demanded the demilitarization of southern Syria, specifically in the provinces of Quneitra, Daraa, and Sweida, to ensure the safety of the Druze population. Israeli forces have established positions in buffer zones and on Mount Hermon to bolster security in these areas.The post Israel orders army to defend Druze community near Damascus first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-army-defend-druze-community-damascus/	2025-03-02T10:59:58-08:00	
Israel halts Gaza aid to pressure Hamas on ceasefire deal	Israel has completely halted the delivery of all goods and humanitarian supplies into Gaza, increasing pressure on Hamas to accept a new proposal aimed at extending the initial phase of a fragile ceasefire. The Israeli government also warned that further consequences would follow if Hamas refuses to engage with the terms presented. Hamas condemned Israel’s move to cut off essential aid, calling it an act of extortion, a violation of international law, and a direct breach of the ceasefire agreement. Despite the escalating rhetoric from both sides, neither officially declared the truce over, leaving the situation in a state of uncertainty. The first phase of the ceasefire agreement, which facilitated increased humanitarian aid into Gaza, officially ended on Saturday. Negotiations over the next phase, which was expected to involve the release of additional hostages in exchange for an Israeli military withdrawal and a more durable ceasefire, have yet to produce an agreement. An Israeli official, speaking anonymously, confirmed that the decision to block aid was coordinated directly with the Trump administration, highlighting the ongoing close collaboration between the two governments. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office announced that Israel supports a proposal put forward by U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff, which calls for extending the initial phase of the ceasefire through both Ramadan and Passover, ending on April 20. According to the proposed plan, Hamas would be required to release half of the remaining hostages on the first day, with the rest to be freed only after both parties reach a final agreement on a permanent ceasefire. Neither the U.S., Egypt, nor Qatar — the main mediators involved in past negotiations — have publicly commented on the latest proposal. During the six-week initial phase of the ceasefire, Hamas released 25 Israeli hostages, along with the bodies of eight others. In return, Israel freed almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli troops largely pulled back from central Gaza, and a temporary increase in aid deliveries helped alleviate some humanitarian needs. However, tensions and accusations persisted throughout the pause, with both sides regularly accusing each other of violating terms. Israeli forces killed dozens of Palestinians during the ceasefire period, claiming they approached restricted zones or ignored security warnings. Hamas, meanwhile, claims the aid suspension directly breaches the ceasefire terms, arguing that the flow of supplies was supposed to continue during talks about the next phase. Israel originally imposed a total blockade on Gaza in the earliest days of the war, only partially easing it later following heavy diplomatic pressure from the Biden administration. Despite that, the United Nations and numerous humanitarian organizations repeatedly criticized Israel for obstructing aid deliveries, arguing that the level of assistance reaching Gaza remained far below what was needed. Israel countered those claims, asserting that adequate supplies were allowed in, while blaming the UN for poor distribution and accusing Hamas of diverting resources. The conflict began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants launched a large-scale assault into southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and taking 251 hostages. As of now, 59 hostages remain in captivity, though 32 are believed to have died. The war’s toll on Gaza has been catastrophic. According to the Gaza Health Ministry, more than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed so far, with over half of the victims reported to be women and children. However, the ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its casualty reports. The extensive Israeli airstrikes and ground operations have reduced large sections of Gaza to rubble. At the peak of the fighting, roughly 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents were displaced. Even now, hundreds of thousands remain crammed into makeshift shelters, including overcrowded schools and tent camps, while most of the population relies entirely on humanitarian aid for food, water, and medical supplies.The post Israel halts Gaza aid to pressure Hamas on ceasefire deal first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-halts-gaza-aid-pressure-hamas-ceasefire-deal/	2025-03-02T10:59:48-08:00	
Flowers, tears and defiance as thousands bury nearly 100 in Leban...	Thousands of mourners gathered in southern Lebanon for an emotional funeral ceremony, honoring nearly 100 Lebanese people who were killed during last year’s war between Israel and Hezbollah. This large-scale funeral, held in the village of Aitaroun, was the biggest mass burial Lebanon has seen since the US-brokered ceasefire came into effect three months earlier. The ceremony followed a separate funeral in Beirut the week before, where tens of thousands came out to pay respects to Hezbollah’s former leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and one of his top aides. The reburial in Aitaroun was arranged to bring home the remains of those killed so they could finally be laid to rest in their hometown. The 95 bodies had originally been buried elsewhere due to the intensity of the conflict and were only recently exhumed for this homecoming. Aitaroun, one of the largest villages in southern Lebanon, was left heavily damaged by the war. Thousands of residents were finally able to return after Israeli forces withdrew from the village in early February. On the day of the reburial, crowds of mourners from Aitaroun and surrounding villages lined the streets, throwing flowers and spraying rose water over the trucks carrying the coffins. Among the mourners were families still searching for the remains of five missing individuals. Of the 95 buried, at least 51 were Hezbollah fighters who had been killed either in Aitaroun or nearby villages. The procession was filled with emotion as relatives carried posters of the deceased, some of whom were as young as 18. The victims also included 16 women, five children, and 10 members of the civil defense who died in the line of duty. Fatima Hejazi, whose 29-year-old brother Ali was among the dead, spoke of her heartbreak while also expressing pride in her brother’s death as part of Hezbollah’s resistance efforts. She, like many others at the funeral, saw those killed as martyrs who gave their lives for the cause. Since Israel intensified its military campaign against Hezbollah in September, the group has reportedly lost hundreds of fighters. However, Hezbollah has not released updated figures on its total losses, though before the escalation they had admitted to losing over 500 fighters during the prior year of lower-level hostilities. During the funeral in Aitaroun, Hezbollah leaders and supporters struck a determined and defiant tone. As the trucks carrying the coffins arrived, organizers called on the crowd to welcome them as heroes. Addressing the mourners, former Hezbollah-allied minister Ibrahim Bayram acknowledged the heavy losses but insisted that the group remains strong. He also urged Lebanon’s government to act with independence rather than under foreign pressure. Among those remembered was a 10-month-old baby girl, who was killed along with 22 others in an Israeli airstrike on October 14, targeting a residential building sheltering displaced families from Aitaroun. At least 32 of the individuals reburied were killed in two particularly deadly Israeli strikes — one on Ain el-Delb in southern Lebanon, and another in Aito, a village in Lebanon’s Christian-majority Zgharta district. These victims, originally from Aitaroun, had been displaced to these areas before being killed. Atef Khouzeirat, who lost his son Hussein in one of the strikes, spoke with anger and sorrow. Hussein, a university graduate who studied radiography, was volunteering with Hezbollah’s Islamic Health Committee at the time. Khouzeirat recounted how his son’s body remained trapped under rubble for 56 days before rescuers were finally able to retrieve it, questioning where the world’s humanity and human rights were in such moments of suffering. The ceremony was attended by official delegations from Iran, Iraq, and Yemen, underscoring the regional significance of the event and Hezbollah’s ties to Tehran and other allies. The wider conflict erupted after Hezbollah launched rockets into Israel on October 8, 2023, a day after Hamas fighters carried out a deadly incursion into southern Israel, which sparked the ongoing war in Gaza. In response, Israel targeted Hezbollah positions with artillery and airstrikes, leading to a steadily intensifying cross-border conflict that escalated into full-scale warfare in September. The toll in Lebanon has been severe, with more than 4,000 killed and over a million people displaced. To date, more than 100,000 Lebanese remain unable to return home due to continued damage and instability. On the Israeli side, dozens of people were killed, and around 60,000 residents of northern Israel were forced to leave their homes to escape the fighting.The post Flowers, tears and defiance as thousands bury nearly 100 in Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/flowers-tears-defiance-thousands-bury-100-lebanon/	2025-03-01T09:47:44-08:00	
Trump approves $3 billion arms deal for Israel	The Trump administration has authorized a substantial arms sale to Israel, totaling nearly $3 billion, by invoking an emergency provision to bypass the standard congressional review process. This decision facilitates the immediate transfer of munitions that have been utilized in Israel's recent military operations against Hamas in Gaza. The approved package includes over 35,500 MK 84 and BLU-117 bombs, along with 4,000 Predator warheads, collectively valued at $2.04 billion. Deliveries for these munitions are scheduled to commence next year. Additionally, the State Department has sanctioned another munitions sale to Israel worth $675.7 million, with deliveries set to begin in 2028. The emergency provision was invoked by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, citing national security interests, thereby waiving the usual congressional review requirements. Furthermore, the administration has approved the sale of D9R and D9T Caterpillar bulldozers to Israel, valued at $295 million. This arms sale occurs in the context of ongoing conflicts in the region, where Israel has been engaged in military actions against Hamas in Gaza. The utilization of MK 84 bombs, which are 2,000-pound general-purpose munitions, has been documented in these operations. The expedited approval of this arms deal underscores the administration's commitment to supporting Israel's defense capabilities amid escalating tensions in the Middle East. The decision to bypass the standard congressional review process has elicited varied reactions. Proponents argue that the urgency of the situation necessitates swift action to ensure Israel's security. Critics, however, express concerns about the lack of legislative oversight and the potential implications for regional stability. The administration maintains that the arms sale is in the national security interests of the United States and is essential for supporting an ally in a volatile region. This development adds to a series of recent arms deals between the United States and Israel, reflecting a continued strategic partnership. The transfer of advanced munitions and equipment is intended to bolster Israel's military readiness and deterrence capabilities in the face of ongoing threats. As deliveries commence in the coming years, the impact of these arms transfers on the regional security landscape will be closely monitored by international observers.The post Trump approves $3 billion arms deal for Israel first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/trump-approves-3-billion-arms-deal-israel/	2025-03-01T09:47:38-08:00	
Israel opens fire as 95 killed in war laid to rest in Aitaroun	In the southern Lebanese town of Aitaroun, families gathered on Friday to mourn 95 individuals, including civilians and Hezbollah fighters, who perished during a 14-month conflict with Israel. These victims had been temporarily interred in Tyre due to the Israeli military's extended presence in border areas beyond the initial withdrawal deadline. The Lebanese Health Ministry and military had designated a plot in Tyre for these provisional burials until conditions allowed for reburial in their hometowns. The return of the coffins, draped in Lebanese and Hezbollah flags, was met with traditional gestures of rice and flowers from residents as they made their way to Aitaroun for official burial ceremonies. However, during the funeral, Israeli forces reportedly fired upon the southern outskirts of the village, highlighting the persistent volatility in the region. Concurrently, Lebanon's newly appointed Prime Minister, Nawaf Salam, toured several war-torn border areas, advocating for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Lebanese territory. He assured residents of border villages of their safe return and committed to the reconstruction of destroyed homes. Salam emphasized the necessity of Arab and international support to ensure Israel's full withdrawal, stating that lasting stability is unattainable without it. The conflict, which ignited on October 8, 2023, following Hezbollah's rocket attacks into northern Israel—a day after a deadly Hamas-led incursion into southern Israel—resulted in over 4,000 Lebanese fatalities and displaced more than a million people at its peak. Despite a ceasefire agreement in late November, Israeli troops have maintained positions on five strategic hills within southern Lebanon. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz announced that Israel, with U.S. approval, would indefinitely retain control over these areas to prevent Hezbollah's return south of the Litani River. The Lebanese government has rejected proposals for joint U.S.-French control over these strategic points, insisting that the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), in coordination with the Lebanese army, assume control. The occupied hills, including locations such as Jabal Blat and Labouneh, are considered strategic due to their vantage points and proximity to northern Israeli towns.The post Israel opens fire as 95 killed in war laid to rest in Aitaroun first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-opens-fire-95-killed-war-laid-aitaroun/	2025-02-28T11:19:16-08:00	
Man caught with $2.5 million arrested at Beirut Airport	On Friday morning, authorities at Beirut's Rafic Hariri International Airport apprehended a man identified as Mohammad H. upon his arrival on a Turkish Pegasus Airlines flight. During a routine inspection, officials discovered $2.5 million in cash concealed within his luggage. This significant seizure has prompted an intensive investigation to determine the origin of the funds and their intended destination. Preliminary reports suggest that the confiscated money was earmarked for Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group. This incident aligns with longstanding allegations from Israel, which asserts that Iranian operatives and Turkish nationals have been covertly funneling money from Tehran and Istanbul into Beirut to bolster Hezbollah's activities. In response to these concerns, Lebanese authorities have taken decisive action by indefinitely suspending all flights to and from Iran. This measure follows warnings from the United States, a key mediator in the November 27 ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel, indicating that Israel might target aircraft suspected of transporting illicit funds or weapons to Hezbollah. The Lebanese Directorate General of Civil Aviation has stated that this suspension is a precautionary step to ensure the safety of air travel and to prevent potential escalations. The flight ban has ignited significant unrest among Hezbollah supporters. Protesters have obstructed the main access road to Beirut's sole international airport, leading to clashes with security forces. Hezbollah's deputy leader, Sheikh Naim Qassem, has publicly condemned the government's decision, accusing it of capitulating to Israeli demands and undermining Lebanon's sovereignty.The post Man caught with $2.5 million arrested at Beirut Airport first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/man-caught-2-5-million-arrested-beirut-airport/	2025-02-28T11:19:08-08:00	
Israel considered striking Nasrallah’s funeral, says Halevi	Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) Chief Herzi Halevi recently suggested that the military considered targeting the funeral of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Addressing cadets at the 1st Infantry Division, Halevi mentioned deliberations about the event, implying a potential attack was under discussion. During Nasrallah's funeral in Beirut, Israeli warplanes conducted low-altitude flyovers, causing a significant disturbance among the tens of thousands of mourners gathered at the Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium. This act was intended as a show of force, with Defense Minister Israel Katz stating that the flyover served as a clear message to those threatening Israel. Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike in September, which also claimed the lives of several Hezbollah officials and a senior Iranian general. His successor, Hashem Safieddine, met a similar fate shortly after assuming leadership. The recent funeral underscored the ongoing tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, with both sides exchanging threats and demonstrating military capabilities.The post Israel considered striking Nasrallah’s funeral, says Halevi first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-considered-striking-nasrallahs-funeral-halevi/	2025-02-27T11:10:12-08:00	
Hamas says it’s ready to negotiate next phase of Gaza ceasefire	Hamas has expressed its readiness to enter discussions for the next phase of the Gaza ceasefire, following a significant prisoner exchange. In this recent exchange, Hamas handed over the remains of four Israeli hostages in return for the release of over 600 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli custody. This marks the completion of the initial phase of the truce, which commenced on January 19, 2025. The hostages returned to Israel were noted to have been killed either during their captivity or in the course of Hamas's initial attack on October 7, 2023, which ignited the ongoing conflict. The current ceasefire aims to bring an end to the war that has severely impacted Gaza. Public pressure within Israel is mounting to extend the ceasefire to facilitate the release of the remaining 59 hostages, though it is believed that fewer than half are still alive. The successful conclusion of the first phase, mediated by Egypt, saw the liberation of 620 Palestinians, including individuals previously sentenced to life for attacks on Israelis. Hamas has emphasized its commitment to the agreement and indicated that further negotiations are contingent upon Israel's adherence to the terms. In a related development, an Israeli official has stated that the military will maintain its presence in the Philadelphi Corridor along the Gaza-Egypt border, despite stipulations in the ceasefire agreement calling for withdrawal. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, cited the necessity of preventing weapons smuggling as the rationale for retaining control over this strategic area. This stance could potentially lead to tensions with Hamas and Egypt, the latter having played a pivotal role in mediating the ceasefire and advocating for Israel's withdrawal from the corridor. The initial phase of the ceasefire is set to conclude this weekend, with subsequent negotiations yet to commence. The war, which erupted in October 2023 following a Hamas attack on Israel, has resulted in substantial casualties and widespread destruction in Gaza. The ceasefire agreement, brokered by Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin al-Thani, includes a 42-day truce, followed by phased negotiations aimed at the release of remaining hostages and the establishment of a permanent ceasefire. Further discussions are scheduled to take place in Cairo to address the implementation of the agreement.

Witkoff: Lebanon and Syria could join Abraham Accords	U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, has expressed optimism about the potential inclusion of Saudi Arabia in the Abraham Accords, a series of normalization agreements between Israel and Arab nations brokered during Trump's first term. Witkoff believes that such a development could pave the way for broader regional peace, suggesting that countries like Lebanon and Syria might also consider normalizing relations with Israel following recent setbacks faced by Iran-backed forces in those nations. In a recent interview, Witkoff emphasized the transformative impact of normalization, stating that it represents 'the beginning of the end of war' in the region. He highlighted that a ceasefire in Gaza is a crucial precondition for expanding the Abraham Accords, as stability would make the region more attractive for investment and reduce the threat of attacks from groups like Hezbollah and Hamas. Witkoff's diplomatic efforts have included meetings with key regional leaders. He recently traveled to Saudi Arabia to discuss potential normalization agreements with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Following this, he visited Israel to engage with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, focusing on advancing the next phase of the ceasefire with Hamas and exploring opportunities to broaden the scope of the Abraham Accords.The post Witkoff: Lebanon and Syria could join Abraham Accords first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/witkoff-lebanon-syria-could-join-abraham-accords/	2025-02-26T09:43:48-08:00	
Israeli general says security stable for northerners to return	Major General Uri Gordin, head of Israel's Northern Command, has informed local leaders near the Lebanese border that the current security conditions permit evacuated residents to return to their communities. He also announced plans to reopen tourist sites in northern Israel by early March. Approximately 60,000 Israelis were evacuated from border areas during the 14-month conflict with Hezbollah. Although a fragile ceasefire has been in place, both sides have reported violations. Israel continues to maintain forces on five strategic Lebanese hills overlooking both southern Lebanon and northern Israel. Despite the evacuation orders being lifted, most displaced residents have yet to return home. The conflict, which began on October 8, 2023, following Hezbollah's rocket attacks a day after a deadly Hamas assault on Israel, led to the evacuation of numerous border settlements. The war resulted in significant casualties and displacement on both sides. In Lebanon, over 1 million people were displaced, with reconstruction efforts expected to take years, especially in southern towns that suffered extensive damage. Hezbollah's rocket attacks claimed the lives of 77 individuals in Israel, more than half of whom were civilians. Israeli air and ground operations led to over 4,000 deaths in Lebanon, predominantly among civilians. The Israeli government has prioritized the return of displaced residents and is offering incentives to encourage them to return to their homes. However, the repatriation process has been slow, partly due to residents' concerns about safety and the substantial rehabilitation needed in affected communities. The prolonged conflict has also had a profound economic impact. A recent survey indicates that one-fifth of Israelis who evacuated their homes have lost their jobs. The displaced population, primarily from areas near Gaza and the Lebanese border, faced extended stays in temporary accommodations, leading to job losses and reduced household incomes. The Israeli economy experienced minimal growth in 2024, partly due to increased defense spending and labor shortages in critical sectors.The post Israeli general says security stable for northerners to return first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-general-security-stable-northerners-return/	2025-02-26T09:43:40-08:00	
How many hostages remain in Gaza?	On Saturday, Hamas released six Israeli hostages, marking the final scheduled release of living captives under the current phase of a ceasefire agreement with Israel. This phase has seen the liberation of 33 Israelis, including eight deceased individuals, and five Thai nationals. Despite these releases, 63 hostages, among them the remains of a soldier held since 2014, remain in Gaza. The transfer of four Israeli hostages' remains was marred by an incident where Hamas handed over the incorrect body for Shiri Bibas, an Israeli mother abducted alongside her two young sons. After a tense standoff, her correct remains were returned and identified early Saturday. The final four sets of remains are expected to be returned in the coming days. The initial abduction of 251 individuals by Hamas-led militants occurred during the October 7, 2023, attack, which ignited the ongoing conflict. The ensuing war has resulted in over 48,000 Palestinian deaths in Gaza, predominantly women and children, as reported by Gaza's Health Ministry. It's important to note that these figures do not differentiate between civilians and combatants. In exchange for the hostages, Israel is releasing nearly 2,000 prisoners and detainees during this first phase of the ceasefire. As of now, 141 hostages have been released through exchanges or other agreements, including four deceased individuals. Sixty-two hostages remain in captivity, with Israel declaring 35 of them deceased. Among the captives are 13 soldiers, seven of whom have been declared dead by Israeli authorities. Additionally, Israeli troops have retrieved the bodies of 40 hostages and rescued eight alive. Non-Israeli captives still held include five individuals—three Thai nationals, one Nepalese, and one Tanzanian—of whom two are believed to be alive. Separately, two hostages held prior to October 7, 2023, have been released. Israel has also recovered the body of a soldier held in Gaza since his death in the 2014 Israel-Hamas war, while the remains of a second soldier killed in 2014 remain in Gaza. The ceasefire agreement remains fragile, with recent delays in the release of 620 Palestinian prisoners by Israel, seeking assurances about the dignified return of its hostages. This postponement has caused distress among families awaiting reunification and poses a risk to the stability of the ceasefire. In Gaza, the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate, with at least six infants succumbing to hypothermia due to inadequate shelter amid cold weather conditions. The ongoing conflict has led to massive casualties and destruction, overshadowing moments of hope for families anticipating the return of their loved ones.The post How many hostages remain in Gaza? first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/how-many-hostages-remain-gaza/	2025-02-25T07:15:33-08:00	
Iran on ‘high alert’ over feared attack on nuclear sites	Iran has heightened the alert status of its defense systems surrounding nuclear facilities due to concerns over potential attacks from Israel and the United States. This move includes the deployment of additional air defense launchers to bolster security. Earlier this month, Iran unveiled the 'Etemad' ballistic missile, which boasts a range of 1,700 kilometers. This missile, measuring 16 meters in length and 1.25 meters in diameter, is equipped with a precision-guided warhead designed to maintain accuracy throughout its flight. The unveiling ceremony in Tehran was attended by President Masoud Pezeshkian, who emphasized that the advancement of defense capabilities aims to deter any aggression against Iranian territory. U.S. intelligence agencies have recently indicated that Israel may be planning a preemptive strike on Iran's nuclear infrastructure by midyear. This assessment follows an incident in October when Israel conducted airstrikes in Iran in response to a missile attack. In light of these developments, Iran has intensified its defensive posture to safeguard its strategic assets. In April, Iran launched a significant missile and drone assault on Israel after the deaths of two Iranian generals in an alleged Israeli airstrike in Syria. While the attack resulted in minimal damage, it marked a notable escalation in regional tensions. Israel, under international pressure to exercise restraint, conducted a limited retaliatory strike. On October 1, Iran fired approximately 180 missiles into Israel, prompting civilians to seek shelter. The assault caused minor damage and a few injuries. Israel responded with airstrikes targeting missile production facilities and air defense sites, aiming to diminish Iran's offensive capabilities.The post Iran on ‘high alert’ over feared attack on nuclear sites first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/iran-high-alert-feared-attack-nuclear-sites/	2025-02-25T07:15:25-08:00	
Israeli warplanes roar low over Beirut during Nasrallah funeral	During the funeral of Hezbollah's former leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in Beirut, Israeli warplanes conducted low-altitude flights over the city, causing sonic booms that resonated throughout the capital. This display coincided with the mass gathering of tens of thousands of mourners at the Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz stated that these flights were intended to send a 'clear message' to those threatening Israel, emphasizing that adversaries would meet a similar fate. Nasrallah, who led Hezbollah for over three decades, was killed in an Israeli airstrike nearly five months prior. His death, along with that of his cousin and designated successor, Hashem Safieddine, marked significant losses for the Iran-backed group. Despite these setbacks, Hezbollah's current leader, Naim Qassem, addressed the crowd, reaffirming the organization's resilience and commitment to resistance against Israel. The funeral drew international attendees, including delegations from Iran, Iraq, and Yemen, underscoring Hezbollah's extensive regional influence. The Israeli flyovers during the ceremony further heightened tensions, with Defense Minister Katz reiterating Israel's stance against any threats to its security.The post Israeli warplanes roar low over Beirut during Nasrallah funeral first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-warplanes-beirut-nasrallah-funeral/	2025-02-23T07:13:30-08:00	
Israel says it struck Hezbollah arms smuggling routes on Lebanon-...	On Saturday, Israeli forces conducted airstrikes along the Lebanon-Syria border, targeting routes allegedly used by Hezbollah for smuggling weapons into Lebanon. The Israeli military stated that these operations aimed to disrupt Hezbollah's efforts to rebuild its arsenal, considering such smuggling attempts a clear violation of existing ceasefire agreements between Israel and Lebanon. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the strikes focused on smuggling routes, including unauthorized crossings along the border. No immediate reports of casualties have emerged from these operations. This military action occurred just one day before the scheduled mass funeral for Hassan Nasrallah, the long-serving leader of Hezbollah, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike nearly five months prior. Nasrallah's death marked a significant setback for the Iran-backed organization, which has faced considerable challenges following last year's conflict and the loss of its ally, Bashar al-Assad, in Syria. The funeral, planned to take place at Beirut's Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium, is expected to draw hundreds of thousands of supporters, including international dignitaries and allies from the region. The event aims to showcase Hezbollah's enduring influence and resilience despite recent adversities. In the lead-up to the funeral, Lebanese state media reported Israeli aircraft flying at low altitudes over Beirut and its suburbs, coinciding with the large gatherings of mourners. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz stated that these flights served as a 'clear message' to those threatening Israel, emphasizing the potential consequences of hostile actions against the nation.The post Israel says it struck Hezbollah arms smuggling routes on Lebanon-Syria border first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-struck-hezbollah-arms-smuggling-lebanon-syria-border/	2025-02-23T07:13:23-08:00	
Thousands arrive in Beirut for Nasrallah’s funeral	Thousands of supporters have converged on Beirut to attend the funeral of Hezbollah's long-standing leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike on September 27, 2024. The funeral is scheduled for February 23, 2025, at Beirut's main sports stadium. Nasrallah, a pivotal figure in Hezbollah for over three decades, was instrumental in shaping the group into a formidable force in the Middle East. His death, resulting from an Israeli airstrike targeting Hezbollah's headquarters in Beirut's southern suburbs, has been a significant blow to the organization. In the days leading up to the funeral, flights from Iraq have been fully booked, with up to 6,000 individuals traveling to Beirut to pay their respects. Notably, American commentator Jackson Hinkle expressed his honor in attending the funeral, highlighting Nasrallah's influence beyond the Middle East. However, Lebanese authorities revoked permission for a passenger plane from Iran, leaving several mourners stranded in Tehran and prompting protests by Hezbollah supporters in Lebanon. The assassination of Nasrallah has escalated tensions in the region, with Lebanese citizens expressing shock and fear of potential all-out war. The airstrike not only claimed Nasrallah's life but also caused significant destruction in Beirut, leading to mass displacement and a heightened sense of vulnerability among residents. In response to the assassination, Yemeni Information Minister Moammar al-Eryani called for the arrest of Houthi officials attending Nasrallah's funeral, urging the Lebanese government to hand them over to Yemen's internationally recognized authorities.The post Thousands arrive in Beirut for Nasrallah’s funeral first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/thousands-arrive-beirut-nasrallahs-funeral/	2025-02-22T06:53:31-08:00	
Lebanese-American convicted of attempting to kill Rushdie	Hadi Matar, a 27-year-old from New Jersey, has been convicted of attempted murder and assault for the 2022 stabbing of author Salman Rushdie during a literary event in New York. The jury deliberated for less than two hours before delivering the verdict. Matar faces up to 25 years in prison, with sentencing scheduled for April. The attack occurred in August 2022 at the Chautauqua Institution, where Rushdie was about to speak. Matar rushed the stage and stabbed Rushdie approximately 15 times, resulting in severe injuries, including the loss of sight in his right eye, liver damage, and paralysis of his right hand. Rushdie was hospitalized for 17 days following the assault. During the trial, Rushdie provided detailed testimony about the attack and its aftermath, describing the intense pain and his belief that he was dying. Matar, who pleaded not guilty and rejected a plea deal, expressed no remorse and faces additional federal terrorism-related charges for allegedly supporting Hezbollah. The motivation for the attack is believed to be linked to a 1989 fatwa issued by Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, calling for Rushdie's death over his novel 'The Satanic Verses,' which was deemed blasphemous by some in the Muslim community. Despite assurances from Iran in 1998 that they no longer supported the fatwa, threats against Rushdie persisted.The post Lebanese-American convicted of attempting to kill Rushdie first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lebanese-american-convicted-attempting-kill-rushdie/	2025-02-22T06:53:24-08:00	
Israel strikes Hezbollah border crossings between Lebanon and Syr...	Israel has announced that its air force targeted crossing points along the Lebanon-Syria border utilized by Hezbollah for smuggling weapons into Lebanon. The Israeli military emphasized that these smuggling activities violate the existing ceasefire agreements between Israel and Lebanon. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the overnight airstrikes rendered an 'illegal crossing' near Lebanon's Wadi Khaled, adjacent to Syria's Homs province, inoperative and resulted in several injuries. The strikes occurred after a convoy of smuggler vehicles was detected moving from Syria toward Lebanon. Lebanon's National News Agency noted that Israeli aircraft were observed flying at low altitudes over Hermel city and surrounding areas in the Bekaa Valley near the Syrian border. This development follows a fragile ceasefire established on November 27, after over a year of hostilities, including two months of intense conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. Both parties have accused each other of breaching the ceasefire terms. Under the ceasefire agreement, the Lebanese military was to deploy in southern Lebanon alongside U.N. peacekeepers as Israeli forces withdrew over a 60-day period, later extended to February 18. Hezbollah was expected to retreat north of the Litani River, approximately 30 kilometers from the border, and dismantle its military infrastructure in the south. However, just before the latest deadline, Israel announced it would maintain troops in five 'strategic points' near the border. Earlier this month, the Israeli military reported conducting an airstrike on a tunnel along the Syria-Lebanon border used by Hezbollah for weapon smuggling. In January, Israeli airstrikes targeted areas in eastern and southern Lebanon, with the Israeli military stating that the operations were against Hezbollah targets, including smuggling routes along the Syrian border. The Lebanon-Syria border spans approximately 330 kilometers without official demarcation. Hezbollah, which has significant influence in regions along this border, has been actively involved in the Syrian conflict, supporting President Bashar al-Assad's forces.The post Israel strikes Hezbollah border crossings between Lebanon and Syria first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-strikes-hezbollah-border-crossings-lebanon-syria/	2025-02-21T03:38:55-08:00	
Arab leaders meet in Saudi Arabia to shape Gaza plan	Arab leaders convened in Saudi Arabia on Friday to formulate a comprehensive recovery plan for Gaza, aiming to counter President Donald Trump's controversial proposal for U.S. control over the territory and the displacement of its inhabitants. Trump's plan has unified Arab nations in opposition, yet debates persist regarding Gaza's future governance and the financing of its reconstruction. The Saudi Press Agency reported that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman extended invitations to leaders from Gulf Arab countries, Egypt, and Jordan for an informal meeting in Riyadh. This gathering seeks to strengthen fraternal relations and prepare for an emergency Arab League summit scheduled in Egypt on March 4. The primary focus is to develop a reconstruction strategy for Gaza that offers a viable alternative to Trump's proposal, which has been widely criticized for its potential to destabilize the region. Egypt is anticipated to present a detailed reconstruction plan during the Riyadh discussions. This plan is expected to outline a phased approach to rebuilding Gaza's infrastructure and economy, emphasizing the importance of Palestinian self-governance and regional cooperation. However, significant challenges remain, particularly concerning the mobilization of financial resources and the establishment of a stable governance framework in the post-war period. The urgency of these discussions is heightened by the extensive devastation in Gaza following prolonged conflict. The United Nations estimates that reconstruction efforts will require substantial investment, with figures potentially reaching into the tens of billions of dollars. The international community, alongside regional stakeholders, faces the critical task of ensuring that reconstruction efforts are inclusive, sustainable, and respectful of the rights and aspirations of the Palestinian people.The post Arab leaders meet in Saudi Arabia to shape Gaza plan first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/arab-leaders-meet-saudi-arabia-shape-gaza-plan/	2025-02-21T03:38:47-08:00	
Hamas returns bodies of four Israeli hostages, including mother a...	On February 20, 2025, Hamas returned the bodies of four Israeli hostages, including mother Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir, who were abducted during the October 7, 2023, attack. The remains were handed over in a somber ceremony in Khan Younis, Gaza, where Hamas displayed the coffins before transferring them to the Red Cross for delivery to Israeli authorities. The fourth body was that of 85-year-old Oded Lifshitz, a peace activist from Nir Oz kibbutz. The Bibas family had been taken from their home in Nir Oz during the October attack. Shiri's husband, Yarden, was also abducted but was released earlier this month. The return of their bodies has been a deeply painful moment for Israel, with President Isaac Herzog expressing profound sorrow and seeking forgiveness for not being able to protect them. This handover is part of a fragile ceasefire agreement that has seen the release of several hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. However, the situation remains tense, with ongoing negotiations and uncertainty about the future of the ceasefire. The conflict has resulted in significant loss of life and widespread devastation in Gaza.The post Hamas returns bodies of four Israeli hostages, including mother and two children first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hamas-returns-bodies-israeli-hostages-mother-children/	2025-02-20T09:05:59-08:00	
Arab leaders unite to challenge Trump’s Gaza plan	Reacting to the proposal by US President Donald Trump to consider putting the Gaza Strip under America's control, expelling its residents, Arab leaders are meeting in Saudi Arabia to devise an alternative plan. The Arab leaders summit will take place tomorrow in Riyadh with leaders from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, Egypt, Jordan, and the Palestinian Authority. Their aim is to work on a rebuilding plan for Gaza which shall retain the population but is to exclude Hamas from being part of the running government. Trump's plan, announced earlier this month, suggests relocating approximately 2 million Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring countries and redeveloping the area into a 'Riviera of the Middle East.' This proposal has been met with widespread condemnation from Arab nations and human rights organizations, who describe it as 'ethnic cleansing.' Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Jordan's King Abdullah II have both rejected the idea of resettling Palestinians within their borders. The alternative plan, primarily developed by Egypt, outlines a three-phase reconstruction process over three to five years. The initial phase focuses on immediate recovery, including debris removal and establishing temporary safe zones within Gaza. The subsequent phase involves an international conference to secure funding and rebuild essential infrastructure. The final phase aims to construct permanent housing and restore educational and healthcare services. A significant aspect of this plan is the exclusion of Hamas from any governing role in the post-reconstruction administration of Gaza. Financing is still the most acute challenge facing the Arab-led initiative. While nations like Kuwait might donate for humanitarian purposes, others like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates will be required to attach certain conditions to financial contributions. The next summit aims to resolve these financial issues and entrench a common Arab position against the U.S. proposal.The post Arab leaders unite to challenge Trump’s Gaza plan first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/arab-leaders-unite-challenge-trumps-gaza-plan/	2025-02-20T09:05:53-08:00
