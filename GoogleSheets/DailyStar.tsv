Slain Israeli Hostage Held by Hamas in Brutal Conditions Beneath ...	The sisters of an Israeli woman, Eden Yerushalmi, who was kidnapped and later killed by Hamas, have described the 'inhuman' conditions of her captivity, sharing their painful experience with CNN. They have been living through what they call a 'nightmare' since her body was found by the Israeli military in a tunnel in Gaza. Eden was abducted from the Nova music festival during Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel. Her body was one of six recovered by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) late last month. Shani and May, Eden's sisters, recounted to CNN's Anderson Cooper that they had received evidence of Eden being alive on three separate occasions, the last of which was just three weeks before her death. Shani expressed how difficult it has been for the family, saying, 'It feels like we’re in a nightmare&#8230; We truly believed Eden would come back home alive.' According to details shared by the IDF after her body was returned, Eden had been held captive in a narrow, windowless tunnel with no air or light, along with limited food. The captives could only sleep in a line and had to use a bucket as a toilet. Eden’s body, found in a Hamas-controlled tunnel under Rafah, showed signs of brutal treatment. The IDF informed the family that she was shot at close range and bore marks on her hands, indicating she tried to defend herself. The deaths of Eden and five other Israeli captives have sparked widespread anger in Israel, particularly directed at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government for its handling of the crisis. Israeli officials reported that more than 1,200 people were killed, and 250 taken hostage during the October 7 attack, while over 40,000 Palestinians have been killed since the conflict began. Eden, along with Hersh Goldberg-Polin and Carmel Gat, had been listed for release as part of a humanitarian agreement between Israel and Hamas. However, delays in executing the deal have stirred controversy, with some blaming the Israeli government. Eden was a 23-year-old Pilates instructor and bartender at the Nova music festival. On the day of the attack, she sent a video of the rocket fire to her family, saying she was leaving the festival. She stayed in contact with her sisters for four hours as she tried to escape, until her final message: 'They’ve caught me.' Her sister May, who chose to see Eden's body after its return, said, 'We gave her a last hug to say goodbye&#8230; She was so thin, we could feel her bones sticking out,' with the autopsy revealing she weighed just 79 pounds. The sisters remembered Eden as a kind and warm-hearted person, with May adding, 'The most important thing is that she was a hero, and she survived 11 months in those tunnels.'The post Slain Israeli Hostage Held by Hamas in Brutal Conditions Beneath Gaza first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/slain-israeli-hostage-hamas-brutal-conditions-gaza/	2024-09-21T03:09:32-07:00	
Israeli Strike on South Beirut Kills Hezbollah Commander, Death T...	The death toll from the Israeli missile strike on a multistory building in southern Beirut has risen to 31, according to Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad. In a press conference on Saturday, Abiad confirmed that the victims included three children and seven women. Additionally, three Syrian nationals were among those killed, while 68 people were reported injured. Hezbollah has also confirmed that at least 16 of its members, including high-ranking commanders, died in the airstrike, which took place on Friday. Rescue teams were still working to clear the rubble on Saturday, searching for missing persons. Abiad noted that some of the body parts recovered were unidentifiable. The minister also updated the death toll from the earlier explosions targeting Hezbollah members via pagers and walkie-talkies, which had risen to 39: 12 people died on Tuesday and 27 more on Wednesday.The post Israeli Strike on South Beirut Kills Hezbollah Commander, Death Toll Climbs to 31 first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strike-beirut-death-toll-31/	2024-09-21T03:09:15-07:00	
Hezbollah Commander Ibrahim Akil Reportedly Targeted in Dahieh St...	Ibrahim Akil, whom Israel claimed to have killed in an airstrike on Beirut’s southern suburbs on Friday, was the head of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan unit and had been on a U.S. sanctions list for nearly a decade. The United States had identified Akil as a 'key leader' within Hezbollah and had offered a $7 million reward for information about him. His death marks the second time in nearly a year that a top Hezbollah commander has been killed during ongoing clashes between the militant group and Israel related to the Gaza conflict. Like many of Hezbollah’s military leaders, little was publicly known about Akil, who was referred to by his alias, Hajj Abdul Qader, within the group. According to a source close to Hezbollah, Akil was the second-highest military leader after Fouad Shukur, who was killed by an Israeli airstrike in Beirut’s southern stronghold on July 30. Lebanese officials have reported that Israel has repeatedly demanded, through international intermediaries, that Hezbollah’s Radwan Force, which leads the group’s ground operations, be moved away from the border. Radwan Unit and Akil's Role The Radwan Force is Hezbollah’s most powerful offensive unit, with its fighters trained in cross-border operations, according to a source close to the group. Some of these fighters have combat experience beyond Lebanon, including in Syria, where Hezbollah has openly supported President Bashar al-Assad’s forces since 2013. The U.S. Treasury previously stated that Akil 'played a vital role' in Hezbollah’s Syrian campaign. Since October, Hezbollah has lost two of its three regional commanders in southern Lebanon, Mohammed Naameh Nasser, who was killed in July by an Israeli airstrike, and Taleb Abdallah, who died in a strike a month earlier. Additionally, the Radwan Force lost commander Wissam Tawil in January. Akil was also a member of Hezbollah’s Jihad Council, the group’s highest military authority. The U.S. Treasury described him as a 'principal member' of the Islamic Jihad Organization, a Hezbollah-affiliated group responsible for the 1983 U.S. embassy bombing in Beirut, which killed 63 people, and the same year’s bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks, which killed 241 soldiers. In the late 1980s, Akil was involved in the kidnapping of two German nationals and bombings in Paris in 1986. He was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury as a terrorist in 2015, and in 2019, the U.S. State Department designated him as a 'Specially Designated Global Terrorist.'The post Hezbollah Commander Ibrahim Akil Reportedly Targeted in Dahieh Strike first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-ibrahim-akil-targeted-dahieh-strike/	2024-09-21T03:09:02-07:00

Israel’s Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, stated on Friday that the nation’s adversaries would not find safety in Beirut’s southern suburb, where an airstrike killed a key Hezbollah commander. 'Our enemies have no safe haven — not even in the Dahieh in Beirut,' Gallant posted on X, referencing the area where Israel confirmed the death of Ibrahim Akil, the commander of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan unit, along with 'around 10' other senior militants.The post Gallant: No Safe Haven for ‘Enemies’ in Hezbollah’s Beirut Stronghold first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/gallant-no-safe-haven-enemies-hezbollahs/	2024-09-21T03:08:44-07:00	
Outrage Flares After Deadly Israeli Strike on Dahieh	Israel announced that it had killed the commander of Hezbollah's elite Radwan unit in a strike on Friday, which Lebanese officials reported left 12 people dead and many others wounded in Hezbollah's stronghold in Beirut. Iranian Embassy Condemns the Attack Following the strike, the Iranian embassy in Lebanon condemned what it called 'Israeli madness' after the assault on Hezbollah’s stronghold in southern Beirut. The embassy stated, 'We strongly condemn the Israeli madness and arrogance that has gone beyond all limits by targeting residential areas in Beirut's southern suburbs.' Hamas Labels the Strike a 'Brutal Escalation' Hamas also condemned the Israeli strike, calling it a 'brutal' escalation. The group’s statement denounced the attack, saying, 'We condemn the brutal and terrorist aggression launched by the Zionist enemy's military on the southern suburb of Beirut,' referring to the incident as an escalation of Israeli aggression. United Nations Expresses Concern and Calls for Restraint The United Nations expressed deep concern over the heightened tensions following the Israeli strikes in Beirut. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric, urged all parties to show 'maximum restraint' and called for immediate de-escalation, stating, 'We are very concerned about the intensified escalation&#8230; including today's deadly strikes in Beirut.'The post Outrage Flares After Deadly Israeli Strike on Dahieh first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/outrage-deadly-israeli-strike-dahieh/	2024-09-21T03:08:35-07:00	
Trump Calls US Election 'Most Important' for Israel’s Future	Former President Donald Trump characterized the upcoming U.S. election as critically significant for Israel, warning that Israel could be 'eradicated,' 'wiped off the face of the earth,' and 'cease to exist' if Vice President Kamala Harris were to become president. During an event focused on antisemitism in the U.S., Trump expressed frustration over what he perceived as a lack of sufficient support from Jewish voters, despite his policies favoring Israel. He urged Jewish voters to prioritize defeating Harris. 'You must defeat Kamala Harris more than anyone else,' Trump told Jewish audience members, adding emphatically that it was crucial for Israel's interests. He also pledged to 'make Israel great again.' In response, Amy Spitalnick, CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs and a former aide to Democratic officials in New York, criticized Trump for using the antisemitism event as a platform to propagate antisemitic stereotypes and attack the American Jewish community. She noted that politicizing Jews and Israel in such a manner jeopardizes the safety of Jews, Israel, and the broader community.The post Trump Calls US Election 'Most Important' for Israel’s Future first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/trump-us-election-most-important-israels/	2024-09-20T03:46:12-07:00	
Israel Signals War Readiness with Hezbollah, Escalation Fears Mou...	This week, a series of deadly blasts from pagers and walkie-talkies revealed a significant breach in Hezbollah’s communication networks across Lebanon, resulting in at least 37 fatalities, including children, and injuring over 3,000 individuals. In response to the blasts, Hezbollah has threatened reprisal against Israel, though it remains uncertain how the Iran-supported militia will react given the compromise to their operational security. Israel's Defense Minister has indicated the onset of a 'new era' in its military strategy, suggesting a focus shift towards the north, near the Lebanese border. This statement subtly confirms the military's involvement in the communications equipment explosions. The covert operations executed this week pose a risk of escalating tensions in the already volatile region. Here are the key developments: Cross-border Engagements Significant military exchanges occurred between Israel and Hezbollah on Thursday. The Israeli military reported targeting around 100 rocket launchers, while Hezbollah claimed at least 17 strikes on Israeli military sites. Israeli Military Activity in Beirut During Nasrallah’s initial speech post-attacks, Israel conducted low altitude flights over Beirut, releasing flares and causing sonic booms, an event captured live by CNN’s Ben Wedeman. Retaliation Promises Hezbollah leader Nasrallah has sternly condemned the covert strikes on communication devices, declaring that Israel has breached critical limits and promising forthcoming retaliation. Iran’s Stance The Revolutionary Guard Corps Commander Hossein Salami of Iran conveyed to Nasrallah that Israel will face a potent and decisive retaliation from the 'axis of resistance,' a coalition of Shia militias across four Middle Eastern nations. Hezbollah’s Capabilities Known as the most heavily armed non-state actor globally, Hezbollah now finds its reputation for being well-equipped and disciplined compromised due to the device attacks. International Reaction A panel of United Nations experts has criticized the attacks on communication devices, labeling them as serious violations of international law and the human right to life, describing these actions as 'terrifying.'The post Israel Signals War Readiness with Hezbollah, Escalation Fears Mount first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-war-readiness-hezbollah-escalation-fears/	2024-09-20T03:44:27-07:00	
Nasrallah Promises Fierce Retaliation to Israel	Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah declared on Thursday that Israel will face severe consequences for the explosions of communication devices that resulted in 37 deaths and nearly 3,000 injuries over the past two days. In his first public address following the incidents, Nasrallah promised that Israel would encounter 'stern retribution and just punishment' both in expected and unexpected forms. He chose not to disclose any specifics regarding the timing, location, or method of Hezbollah's intended response. During his televised speech, Israeli fighter jets were reported to disrupt the calm over Beirut, flying at low altitudes and deploying flares designed to mislead heat-seeking missiles. Nasrallah also spoke directly to Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, stating that military actions would not enable the resettlement of displaced northern residents. He emphasized that no form of military escalation or violence would facilitate their return to the border areas. He asserted that the only solution for returning the displaced individuals to their homes in the north lies in ceasing hostilities in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Additionally, Nasrallah announced that Hezbollah is conducting an internal investigation into the blast of hundreds of their operatives' communication devices throughout Lebanon. He acknowledged that these incidents represented a significant and unprecedented setback for Hezbollah but insisted they would not be defeated. Nasrallah revealed that messages indicating the strikes were intended to cease hostilities on the Lebanese front had been received, along with warnings of further actions if the fighting did not stop. Despite this, he reassured that the extensive bombings had not compromised the group's operational capabilities.The post Nasrallah Promises Fierce Retaliation to Israel first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/nasrallah-promises-retaliation-israel/	2024-09-20T03:44:14-07:00	
Israeli Airstrikes Target Hezbollah Following Death of 2 Troops	On Thursday, the Israeli military initiated new assaults on Hezbollah locations in Lebanon, concurrently with the sounding of alert sirens across northern Israel, suggesting possible incoming attacks. The military disclosed that the operations were aimed at diminishing Hezbollah's terrorist capabilities and infrastructure. This action forms part of a broader initiative to enable displaced Israelis to return to their residences in the northern regions. Additionally, the Israeli forces reported the deaths of two soldiers due to rocket strikes from Hezbollah near the northern Lebanese border. The casualties were Reservist Major Nael Fwarsy, aged 43, and Sergeant Tomer Keren, aged 20, who both died in separate encounters, according to military sources. Hezbollah seemed to escalate its retaliatory strikes on Thursday. This increase in hostility followed the explosion of communication devices belonging to thousands of its members across Lebanon, incidents that have been attributed to Israel. These explosions resulted in 37 deaths and nearly 3,000 injuries over a span of two days.The post Israeli Airstrikes Target Hezbollah Following Death of 2 Troops first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-airstrikes-hezbollah-death-2/	2024-09-20T03:43:51-07:00	
Israel Strikes South Lebanon as Hezbollah Escalates Attacks	Israel's military confirmed that its jets targeted approximately 100 Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon during two waves of intense airstrikes overnight. The strikes hit about 100 launchers and additional Hezbollah infrastructure, including around 1,000 barrels that were reportedly set for immediate firing, according to the Israeli army. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported that the southern region was hit at least 52 times during the night, marking one of the most significant bombardments by Israel since the border skirmishes began last October. In response, Hezbollah launched at least 17 attacks on Israeli military sites in northern Israel on Thursday. These developments, including the deadly explosions in Lebanon earlier in the week and Thursday's heavy bombardments, came after Israel declared a shift in its war objectives, focusing on its northern border with Lebanon, where clashes with Hezbollah have intensified. For nearly a year, Israel's military efforts had been concentrated on the Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza. However, it has also been engaged in frequent exchanges of fire with Hezbollah along the northern border. International mediators have been working to prevent a full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah and to contain the regional impact of the conflict in Gaza, which was triggered by Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel. Hezbollah maintains that its attacks are in support of Hamas, and its leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, pledged on Thursday that these attacks will persist as long as the war in Gaza continues. The cross-border exchanges have claimed hundreds of lives in Lebanon, most of them fighters, and dozens in Israel, including soldiers. The ongoing violence has also forced tens of thousands of residents on both sides of the border to flee their homes. During a visit to Israeli troops on Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant warned that Hezbollah 'will pay an increasing price' as Israel seeks to secure the safe return of its citizens to the border areas. 'We are at the start of a new phase in the war,' he said. Iran's Revolutionary Guards also warned Israel of a 'crushing response from the resistance front' following the recent blasts, which injured Tehran's ambassador in Beirut. Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who has been working to facilitate a ceasefire in Gaza and negotiate the release of hostages, called for restraint from all sides, emphasizing the importance of avoiding actions that could escalate the situation. He joined European foreign ministers in Paris to discuss the ongoing crisis. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre reiterated that President Joe Biden believes a diplomatic resolution between Israel and Hezbollah is still possible.The post Israel Strikes South Lebanon as Hezbollah Escalates Attacks first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-strikes-south-lebanon-hezbollah-escalates-attacks/	2024-09-20T03:43:38-07:00	
Taiwan Questions Two in Hezbollah Pager Investigation	Taiwan Questions Two in Hezbollah Pager InvestigaTaiwan Questions Two in He Two individuals from Taiwanese companies were questioned in connection with an investigation into pagers that exploded while being used by Hezbollah operatives in Lebanon, according to investigators on Friday. Top officials in Taiwan have emphasized that the devices were not sourced from the island. The origin and supply of the pagers have been the subject of speculation after hundreds of them, along with walkie-talkies, detonated across Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday, resulting in at least 37 deaths and nearly 3,000 injuries. A report by The New York Times suggested that Israel had inserted explosive material into a shipment of pagers from Taiwan's Gold Apollo, citing anonymous American and other officials. However, Gold Apollo’s head, Hsu Ching-kuang, denied that his company produced the devices in question, attributing the production to Hungary-based partner BAC Consulting KFT, which had been licensed to use Gold Apollo’s trademark. Reports indicated that the second individual questioned was Wu Yu-jen, a representative connected to BAC Consulting KFT, who had established a Taipei-based company called 'Apollo Systems.' Taipei's Shilin District Prosecutors' Office issued a statement on Friday, saying, 'Our country takes this case very seriously.' The office confirmed that two individuals from Taiwanese companies had been interviewed as witnesses and released after multiple rounds of questioning. Authorities also conducted searches in four locations, including Gold Apollo’s site in New Taipei City’s Xizhi district and the Neihu district of Taipei, where Apollo Systems is registered. Wu did not speak to reporters when brought in for questioning on Thursday, according to local news footage. Taiwan's Economic Minister Kuo Jyh-huei told reporters that Gold Apollo's pagers, made in Taiwan, consist of basic components like low-end integrated circuits (IC) and batteries, and he stressed, 'These things would not explode.' He added that the company had exported 260,000 pagers in the past two years without any previous incidents of explosions. Kuo assured that the pagers used by Hezbollah were not produced in Taiwan. Premier Cho Jung-tai also reiterated on Friday that neither the company nor Taiwan had directly exported pagers to Lebanon. Earlier this week, Gold Apollo clarified that the pager model mentioned in media reports was produced and sold by BAC. However, a Hungarian government spokesperson stated that BAC Consulting KFT is merely a trading intermediary with no manufacturing or operational site in Hungary. zbollah Pager InvestigationtionThe post Taiwan Questions Two in Hezbollah Pager Investigation first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/taiwan-questions-two-hezbollah-pager-investigation/	2024-09-20T03:43:27-07:00	
It is Fake News that Bulgaria is Linked to Exploding Devices in L...	Multiple fake news articles continously appear throughout the web that Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, has connections to the heart-breaking events in Lebanon. International investigators have ruled out the possibility of explosive devices being transported through Bulgaria. Experts say that Bulgarian connection to this event is fake news. In a statement released by the Bulgarian authorities and National Security State Agency, is stated that 'After thorough internal investigations, no customs procedures involving communication devices (pagers) have been processed through Bulgarian territory.' Fake news have been traced back to a Hungarian news website which blames a Bulgarian company, called Norta Global Ltd, to have delivered the devices to Lebanon from Bulgaria. Meanwhile, Hungarian government authorities and private Hungarian media websites have been flagged by the West to have strong support for the Russian president Vladimir Putin. Victor Orban has been repeatedly accused of being the only supporter of the Russian aggression inside the EU. The statement came in response to media reports suggesting that a company based in Bulgaria had supplied Hezbollah in Lebanon with the devices that later exploded in Lebanon and Syria. The Sofia-based company in question, Norta Global Ltd., owned by a Norwegian citizen, has been manipulatively linked to the sale of these devices by the Hungarian media. It is not the first time that Russian propaganda has been supported by third party members, in order to blame countries that support the Ukrainian defence. Western investigators are currently conducting joint investigations with the National Revenue Agency and the Bulgarian Ministry of Interior into the possible involvement of a Bulgarian-registered company in supplying communication equipment to Hezbollah. No physical proof has been found that Bulgarian citizens are connected to the sale of the devices. However, there are numerous fake articles in the web on this topic. Norta Global Ltd. was registered in April 2022 as a project management company. However, there is no evidence that the company manufactures products, and no financial records have been found. The company shares its registered address in downtown Sofia and it is currently non-operational. The owner of the company is the Norwegian citizen Rinson Jose, who also has a different company in Hungary. Hezbollah received thousands of pagers as part of a move to create a more secure communication network. This distribution increased significantly after Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah advised members to steer clear of cellphones, labeling them as tools of Israeli surveillance, and recommended pagers as a more secure option. At the same time, walkie-talkies that detonated on Wednesday were acquired around the same time as the pagers, back in April. Icom Inc., a Japanese company that manufactures the handheld radios in question, stated that the models in question were discontinued about ten years ago. The company is currently investigating and confirmed on Thursday that their IC-V82 radios had been shipped to the Middle East between 2004 and 2014. These unusual incidents, which Hezbollah has blamed on Israel, have left the Lebanese public in shock. According to the Saudi Al Hadath network, citing Iranian sources, many are now hastily discarding their wireless devices, as the walkie-talkies that exploded on Wednesday are also commonly used in Iran.The post It is Fake News that Bulgaria is Linked to Exploding Devices in Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/fake-news-that-bulgaria-is-linked-to-exploding-devices-in-lebanon/	2024-09-19T13:37:14-07:00

White House Warns of ‘Escalation’ in Mideast Following Lebanon Bl...	The White House has urged all parties to avoid escalating the conflict in the Middle East following two days of explosions in Lebanon, widely linked to Israel, targeting Hezbollah with handheld devices. 'We do not want to see any further escalation. We believe the solution to the current crisis is not through more military action,' National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Wednesday. Kirby emphasized that diplomacy remains the best path to avoid opening another front in Lebanon, which could further complicate the situation. Iran, a supporter of Hezbollah, has refrained from a major response following an attack in Tehran that killed a senior Hamas leader. Since Hamas' October 7 assault, Israel has engaged in ongoing clashes with Hezbollah, which also receives backing from Iran. When asked about whether Israel was complying with international humanitarian law in the attacks on pagers and walkie-talkies in Lebanon, Kirby said, 'As we've maintained from the beginning, Israel has a right to defend itself.' He added that the U.S. continues to communicate with Israel about how they conduct their operations but did not confirm Israel's involvement in the blasts. Kirby reiterated that the U.S. had no involvement in the incidents: 'We were not involved in yesterday's or today's events in any way.'The post White House Warns of ‘Escalation’ in Mideast Following Lebanon Blasts first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/white-house-warns-escalation-in-mideast-lebanon-blasts/	2024-09-19T03:59:23-07:00

In a statement, the military said that its air force targeted Hezbollah positions in the areas of Chihine, Taybeh, Blida, Mays al-Jabal, Aitaroun, and Kfarkela in southern Lebanon. Additionally, a Hezbollah weapons storage site in Khiam was also hit. In retaliation, Hezbollah attacked Israeli soldiers stationed at the al-Marj post in northern Israel. Israeli media reported that several individuals were injured in Ya’ara following suicide drone attacks launched from Lebanon. Several other drones hit Beit Hillel, near Kiryat Shmona, sparking fires but causing no injuries, according to the Israeli army.The post Suicide Drones Hit Northern Israel, Causing Injuries and Sparking Fire first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/drones-hit-northern-israel-injuries-fire/	2024-09-19T03:59:11-07:00

Top diplomats from the United States, Britain, Germany, France, and Italy are set to meet in Paris on Thursday to address the escalating tensions in the Middle East, sources revealed on Wednesday. The gathering comes amid increasing fears of a broader regional conflict, as violence in Gaza intensifies and Lebanon experiences two days of explosive attacks, which Hezbollah has blamed on Israel. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will join his counterparts from these allied nations in the French capital following talks in Cairo focused on a possible truce in Gaza. Blinken's visit aims to revive stalled negotiations, mediated by Egypt, Qatar, and the U.S., to bring an end to the ongoing conflict. He emphasized that a ceasefire in Gaza would be the most effective way to prevent further violence from spreading throughout the region. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani, who confirmed his attendance, also noted that discussions would include the ongoing war in Ukraine.The post US, European Diplomats to Tackle Mideast Tensions Thursday in Paris first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-european-diplomats-tackle-mideast-tensions-paris/	2024-09-19T03:59:00-07:00	
Iran Accuses Israel of ‘Mass Murder’ Following Pager Explosions	Iran on Wednesday accused Israel of committing 'mass murder' following explosions of paging devices linked to the Tehran-backed Hezbollah group in Lebanon, which resulted in the deaths of nine people and injured nearly 3,000 others.

Blinken Arrives in Egypt to Push for Gaza Ceasefire	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Cairo on Wednesday in an effort to revive ceasefire negotiations for Gaza, a process made more difficult by recent explosions targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon. This marked Blinken's 10th trip to the Middle East since the Gaza conflict began nearly a year ago. During his visit, he met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and planned a press conference with Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty. However, there are no plans for him to travel to other Arab capitals or Israel. According to the U.S. State Department, the primary focus of Blinken’s visit was discussing the ongoing negotiation efforts with Egyptian officials. Although U.S. officials privately acknowledged they did not expect significant breakthroughs, Blinken aimed to sustain pressure for a potential agreement between Israel and Hamas. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller emphasized the importance of moving toward a deal without further delays, while avoiding any specific timeline for a proposal. The key sticking points include Israel's refusal to withdraw from the Philadelphi corridor on the Egypt-Gaza border and new demands from Hamas regarding the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. Blinken’s visit also came after explosions hit Hezbollah members' pagers across Lebanon, killing at least nine and injuring 2,800 others, an attack that Hezbollah blamed on Israel. Israel has not commented on the blasts, but had earlier stated it was broadening its war aims to include targeting Hezbollah. While in Cairo, Blinken is also expected to discuss strengthening U.S.-Egypt relations. Egypt, although frequently accused of human rights abuses, remains a key U.S. partner. Last week, Washington released $1.3 billion in military aid to Egypt without imposing rights conditions, unlike the previous year. After his Cairo visit, Blinken is scheduled to travel to Paris to brief officials from France, Britain, and Italy.The post Blinken Arrives in Egypt to Push for Gaza Ceasefire first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/blinken-arrives-egypt-push-gaza-ceasefire/	2024-09-18T02:27:06-07:00	
Nasrallah to Address Nation Thursday Following Pager Blasts	Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah is set to deliver a speech on Thursday, following a series of explosions involving pagers used by Hezbollah members across Lebanon. According to a statement released by Hezbollah on Wednesday, Nasrallah will address 'the latest developments' in a speech scheduled for 5:00 pm (1400 GMT). In response to the deadly explosions, which the group has blamed on Israel, Hezbollah reaffirmed its commitment to ongoing operations in support of Gaza. The group stated, 'This path is ongoing and separate from the difficult reckoning that the criminal enemy must await for its massacre on Tuesday,' referencing the recent attacks. The speech is expected to touch on these incidents and Hezbollah's continued activities amid the current regional tensions.The post Nasrallah to Address Nation Thursday Following Pager Blasts first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/nasrallah-address-nation-pager-blasts/	2024-09-18T02:26:41-07:00	
Taiwan’s Gold Apollo Blames Hungary for Exploding Pagers	Gold Apollo, a Taiwanese company, confirmed on Wednesday that it had authorized the use of its brand on the pagers involved in recent explosions in Lebanon and Syria, though the devices were actually manufactured by BAC Consulting KFT, a company based in Budapest. These pagers, which were primarily used by Hezbollah, detonated nearly simultaneously on Tuesday, leading to the deaths of at least nine people, including an 8-year-old girl, and wounding nearly 3,000 others. Hezbollah and the Lebanese government have accused Israel of orchestrating the attack, which appears to have been a sophisticated remote operation. An anonymous U.S. official revealed that Israel had briefed the U.S. after the operation's conclusion, stating that small explosives hidden inside the pagers had been remotely triggered. In a statement on Wednesday, Gold Apollo explained that while it allowed BAC to use its brand in specific regions, the design and manufacturing of the pagers were entirely BAC's responsibility. The AR-924 pager model, involved in the explosions, was known for its rugged build and long battery life, critical features in a country like Lebanon, where power outages are frequent. The attacks primarily targeted areas where Hezbollah holds significant influence, such as southern Beirut and the Beqaa region in eastern Lebanon. Hezbollah responded by reaffirming its commitment to continuing its strikes against Israel as part of its ongoing support for Hamas and Palestinians in Gaza. The group also vowed retaliation for what they termed a 'massacre' committed by Israel. The blasts caused chaos across Beirut, with hospitals overwhelmed by patients suffering severe injuries, particularly to the eyes and limbs. Lebanon's Health Minister, Firas Abiad, reported that several countries, including Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Egypt, had offered assistance in treating the injured. Medical supplies and equipment were flown into Beirut, including 15 tons delivered by an Iraqi military plane. Experts believe that the explosives were inserted into the pagers before they were distributed to Hezbollah, highlighting the sophisticated nature of the supply chain infiltration. The use of pagers, as opposed to mobile phones, had been a deliberate strategy by Hezbollah to avoid Israeli electronic surveillance. In the past, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah had warned of the dangers of mobile phones being used as surveillance tools.The post Taiwan’s Gold Apollo Blames Hungary for Exploding Pagers first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/gold-apollo-blames-hungary-exploding-pagers/	2024-09-18T02:26:30-07:00	
Hezbollah Vows Retaliation Against Israel After Deadly Pager Blas...	Hezbollah vowed retaliation against Israel on Wednesday after a coordinated attack caused hundreds of pagers used by its members to explode across Lebanon, killing nine people and injuring around 2,800 others. Among the dead was the 10-year-old daughter of a Hezbollah member. The explosions came shortly after Israel announced it was expanding its military operations to include Hezbollah, following Hamas's October 7 assault on Israel. 'We hold Israel fully responsible for this criminal act,' Hezbollah said, promising retribution for what they called 'sinful aggression.' In a further statement, Hezbollah reaffirmed their support for Gaza and vowed vengeance for the attacks. Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah is scheduled to address the public on Thursday. Lebanese Health Minister Firas Abiad confirmed the blasts killed nine people and left 200 in critical condition. Analyst Charles Lister speculated that the explosions were caused by small plastic explosives hidden with the pager batteries, possibly activated remotely. He suggested Israel's Mossad likely infiltrated the supply chain to carry out the attack. The incident has overwhelmed hospitals in Hezbollah-controlled areas. In one Beirut hospital, victims were treated in parking lots due to the influx of patients. In addition to the Hezbollah casualties, Tehran’s ambassador in Beirut was also injured, though not seriously. This attack delivered a significant blow to Hezbollah, particularly regarding the security of its communications network. A source close to the group reported that the pagers were part of a shipment of 1,000 devices believed to have been sabotaged before reaching Hezbollah. The blasts occurred just as Israel broadened its military objectives to include Hezbollah, having initially focused on Hamas in Gaza. Israel and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire since the October 7 Hamas attack, with casualties on both sides, including civilians and soldiers. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken returned to the region on Wednesday in a renewed attempt to push for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, with ongoing negotiations involving Qatar and Egypt. Meanwhile, the United Nations General Assembly debated a resolution calling for an end to Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories within 12 months, though Israel dismissed the draft as 'disgraceful.'The post Hezbollah Vows Retaliation Against Israel After Deadly Pager Blasts first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollaretaliation-israel-deadly-blasts/	2024-09-18T02:25:58-07:00	
Renowned Lebanese Novelist Elias Khoury Dies at 76	Lebanese novelist Elias Khoury, a passionate advocate for the Palestinian cause and a prominent figure in Arab literature, passed away at the age of 76. Known for his strong political views and commitment to freedom of expression, Khoury authored numerous novels and essays that voiced his criticisms of Middle Eastern dictatorships and Israeli policies in Palestine. Khoury had been battling illness for months, and despite frequent hospitalizations, he continued to write, often posting articles from his hospital bed. His work, which spanned five decades, made him a well-known intellectual across the Arab world. One of his most recent articles, published in July 2023, reflected on his experiences with pain and his admiration for the resilience of the Palestinian people. Throughout his life, Khoury stood firmly in support of the Palestinian cause, criticizing Israel’s occupation and settlement policies. In an article published just days after the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war on October 7, 2023, he described Gaza as 'the biggest open-air prison,' highlighting the hardships faced by its people. Born in Beirut in 1948, Khoury studied at the Lebanese University and later earned a PhD in social history from the University of Paris. He was actively involved in Lebanon’s civil war and sustained injuries during the conflict. In addition to his prolific writing career, Khoury edited the cultural sections of major Lebanese newspapers such as An-Nahar and As-Safir and served as the editor-in-chief of the Palestine Studies magazine. Khoury’s literary works, which include 'Little Mountain' and the widely acclaimed 'Bab al-Shams' (Gate of the Sun), explored the struggles of Palestinian refugees and the Lebanese Civil War. His novels have been translated into several languages, including Hebrew, and have earned him international recognition. Khoury also taught at prestigious institutions like New York University, Columbia, Princeton, and the University of London. Elias Khoury leaves behind a legacy of literature deeply intertwined with the region’s political and social history, offering profound insights into the human condition amid conflict and displacement.The post Renowned Lebanese Novelist Elias Khoury Dies at 76 first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lebanese-novelist-elias-khoury-dies-76/	2024-09-17T00:55:45-07:00	
Israel Stands Firm as Hochstein Warns Against Lebanon War	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told U.S. mediator Amos Hochstein on Monday that a 'fundamental change' is necessary after nearly a year of cross-border clashes with Hezbollah in Lebanon. Netanyahu stated that displaced residents from northern Israel cannot return home until the security situation significantly improves, and emphasized that Israel 'will do what is necessary' to safeguard its security. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant shared similar concerns with Hochstein, expressing that hopes for ending the conflict with Hezbollah are fading. Gallant underscored that Hezbollah, backed by Iran, has tied itself to Hamas and refuses to end its involvement, thus making military action the only viable option to secure the northern region. Gallant also conveyed this message in a phone call with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, warning that time is running out for a diplomatic solution. Hochstein, however, cautioned Israeli leaders that a broader conflict with Lebanon would not necessarily return displaced residents to their homes and risks escalating into a prolonged regional war. The U.S. remains committed to seeking a diplomatic resolution in both the northern sector and Gaza. Despite efforts by the U.S., Qatar, and Egypt to mediate a ceasefire in Gaza, there has been little progress in halting the fighting between Hezbollah and Israel. Hezbollah officials have indicated they would stand down if a Gaza ceasefire is reached, but Israel remains adamant that it cannot allow militants to operate near its northern border. The ongoing violence has killed hundreds, mostly fighters in Lebanon, along with civilians and soldiers on both sides, displacing tens of thousands. Hezbollah's deputy leader, Sheikh Naim Qassem, stated over the weekend that the group does not seek war, but warned that if Israel initiates one, there will be 'large losses on both sides.' Israel and Hezbollah last fought a month-long war in 2006, which killed over 1,200 people in Lebanon and 160 Israelis. Meanwhile, Israeli media reported possible tensions within the Israeli government, as Netanyahu is said to be considering firing Gallant, though Netanyahu's office has denied these claims. Gallant, a former general, has disagreed with Netanyahu over the post-war governance of Gaza, favoring a plan where Palestinian entities, supported by international actors, would control the territory, rejecting any long-term Israeli occupation. Netanyahu has also stated that the situation on the northern border is unsustainable, calling for a shift in the balance of power, though he did not specify how this would be achieved.The post Israel Stands Firm as Hochstein Warns Against Lebanon War first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-firm-hochstein-warns-lebanon-war/	2024-09-17T00:39:22-07:00	
Hamas Chief Vows Gaza Militants Ready for ‘Long War of Attrition’	Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar stated on Monday that the group is ready for an extended conflict with Israel, in a message directed at Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels, nearly a year into the Gaza war. He emphasized that Hamas has prepared for a prolonged struggle, which he believes will erode Israel's political resolve. Sinwar also expressed confidence that Hamas, alongside Iran-aligned groups in Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen, would ultimately prevail against Israel. This statement followed a missile attack on central Israel, claimed by the Houthis on Sunday. While the attack did not cause any casualties, it prompted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to vow retaliation. In his message to Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi, Sinwar praised the success of the missile strike, saying the Houthis had penetrated Israel's defense systems. He added that Hamas’s joint efforts with allies in Lebanon and Iraq would bring about Israel's defeat. Since November, the Houthis have been targeting Israel, claiming solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. These attacks, including missile and drone strikes, have disrupted international shipping off Yemen's coast. The Houthis, part of Iran’s 'axis of resistance,' have aligned themselves with groups like Hamas, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and several Iraqi Shiite factions. In July, a Houthi drone strike killed a civilian in Tel Aviv, which led to Israeli retaliatory strikes that caused severe damage at Yemen's Hodeida port, controlled by the Houthis.The post Hamas Chief Vows Gaza Militants Ready for ‘Long War of Attrition’ first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hamas-gaza-militants-ready-war-attrition/	2024-09-17T00:11:09-07:00	
Germany Reinstates Border Controls, Sparking Tensions with Neighb...	Germany has reinstated temporary border controls on its western and northern borders as of Monday, September 16, in an effort to combat irregular migration and cross-border crime. The new measures will apply for an initial six months to the land borders shared with France, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Denmark. Previously, similar restrictions had already been in place along the borders with Poland, the Czech Republic, Austria, and Switzerland. According to a report by Reuters, these controls are part of a broader government strategy aimed at addressing the recent rise in migrant arrivals. Flexible Border Checks by Police Germany's interior ministry announced that the Federal Police would carry out these checks with flexibility, adjusting their operations according to the current security situation. The goal is to minimize disruptions to daily commuters, travelers, and trade. The ministry advised travelers to carry valid identification, while non-EU citizens should have their visas and other required entry documents ready for inspection. The reintroduction of these temporary border controls marks another challenge to the free movement of people within the European Union. Criticism from Neighboring Countries Germany's decision has drawn criticism from neighboring countries. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk called for urgent talks with other affected nations, expressing concern over the potential increase in asylum seekers and the impact on trade. Austria’s Chancellor Karl Nehammer warned that if Germany began returning more migrants across their shared border, Austria would respond by redirecting more people toward the Balkans. Border checks with Austria are scheduled to continue until November 11, while those with Poland, the Czech Republic, and Switzerland are expected to remain in place until December 15. Impact of Border Controls These measures follow a backdrop of falling asylum applications in Germany, which have decreased by 21.7% in the first eight months of 2024. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser credited the decline in part to last year’s introduction of border controls, which prevented over 30,000 unauthorized entries. In a statement, Faeser emphasized the need for expanding the temporary border controls to cover all of Germany's land borders. 'This decision also aims to address the acute threat of Islamist extremist terrorism and serious cross-border crime,' she added.The post Germany Reinstates Border Controls, Sparking Tensions with Neighbors first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/germany-border-controls-tensions-neighbors/	2024-09-16T08:26:27-07:00	
US Media Reveals Suspect in Latest Trump Assassination Attempt	U.S. media have identified Ryan Wesley Routh, whom AFP interviewed in Kyiv in 2022, as the suspect in an alleged assassination attempt on Donald Trump. Routh, 58, was reportedly arrested after U.S. Secret Service agents fired on a man carrying an AK-47-style rifle near Trump’s Florida golf course, where the former president was golfing on Sunday. According to reports, Routh emerged from the shrubbery where he had been hiding and fled the scene in a black car before authorities apprehended him. Media outlets such as CNN and CBS described Routh as a self-employed affordable housing builder in Hawaii, with a criminal record spanning several decades. His online posts included political commentary, some of which were critical of Trump, the current Republican presidential candidate. One of Routh’s causes was supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russia's invasion. In a March 2022 post on X (formerly Twitter), Routh expressed his willingness to volunteer and fight in Ukraine, stating, 'I AM WILLING TO FLY TO KRAKOW AND GO TO THE BORDER OF UKRAINE TO VOLUNTEER AND FIGHT AND DIE&#8230; Can I be the example We must win.' The New York Times, which also interviewed him, cited this post. AFP had interviewed Routh in Kyiv in April 2022 while he participated in a demonstration supporting Ukrainians trapped in Mariupol. He was quoted as saying, 'Putin is a terrorist, and he needs to be ended, so we need everybody from around the world to stop what they are doing and come here now.' The U.S. has been a strong supporter of Ukraine since Russia's invasion began in February 2022. As the 2024 U.S. presidential election approaches, current President Joe Biden is set to be replaced by either his Vice President Kamala Harris, who plans to continue backing Ukraine, or by Trump, who avoided stating during a recent debate whether he supported Ukraine’s victory in the war.The post US Media Reveals Suspect in Latest Trump Assassination Attempt first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-media-suspect-trump-assassination-attempt/	2024-09-16T08:24:59-07:00
