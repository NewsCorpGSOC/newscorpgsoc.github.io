Israel Frees 7 Civilians Detained in South Lebanon After Truce	On Sunday, Israeli forces handed over seven detainees to United Nations peacekeepers at the border as part of a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. According to Lebanese state media, the prisoners had been held by Israel after the ceasefire came into effect. This event follows Israel's intensified military operations in southern Lebanon, which began in late September, after Hezbollah's cross-border attacks in support of Hamas. These actions were in response to the October 7, 2023, Hamas assault on southern Israel. A ceasefire was established on November 27, though both sides have accused each other of violations since then. The seven detainees were transferred to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) at Ras Naqoura, then taken to a hospital for medical checkups with assistance from the Lebanese Red Cross and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Afterward, they were sent to Sidon for further investigation. The ceasefire agreement stipulated that the Lebanese army would deploy in southern Lebanon alongside UN peacekeepers, while Israel would begin withdrawing its forces over a 60-day period. Hezbollah was also required to relocate its forces north of the Litani River, and dismantle its military infrastructure in the south. In the meantime, the Israeli army claimed to have located and destroyed a combat compound in southern Lebanon containing several weapons storage facilities. Despite the ceasefire, Israel has continued to carry out military actions, including bombings in the towns of Kfar Kila and Bint Jbeil, leading to condemnation from Lebanese media regarding repeated attacks on southern villages.The post Israel Frees 7 Civilians Detained in South Lebanon After Truce first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-frees-7-civilians-south-lebanon-truce/	2024-12-23T04:03:04-08:00	
Mikati Tours Military Positions in South Lebanon	Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati has initiated a visit to military positions in southern Lebanon, nearly a month after a ceasefire agreement ended the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. This marks Mikati's first trip to the southern frontlines, where, as per the U.S.-mediated deal, Lebanese troops are set to gradually deploy. Both Hezbollah fighters and Israeli forces are expected to pull back by the end of next month. Mikati's tour follows ongoing frustration from the Lebanese government over Israeli airstrikes and overflights. After meeting with Lebanese Army Commander Joseph Aoun at a military base in Marjayoun, Mikati emphasized the tasks ahead. He stressed the importance of ensuring Israel’s withdrawal from the territories it had occupied during its recent military actions, stating that this would enable the Lebanese army to fully carry out its duties. The Lebanese military has long depended on foreign aid, particularly from the U.S. and other Western nations, to maintain its operations. With the conflict’s conclusion and the ceasefire in place, Lebanon hopes that additional funding will bolster the army’s capacity to establish a stronger presence in the south, where Hezbollah’s armed units had been active. Despite not directly engaging in combat, numerous Lebanese soldiers were killed in Israeli airstrikes targeting their positions or patrols in the region.The post Mikati Tours Military Positions in South Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/mikati-tours-military-positions-in-south-lebanon/	2024-12-23T04:02:54-08:00	
Iran’s Khamenei Predicts Syrian Youth Will Resist New Government	Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has expressed confidence that young Syrians will resist the new government following the fall of Bashar al-Assad. He pointed out that these young individuals, who now face instability after Assad's ousting, have 'nothing to lose' and are likely to resist the new order. Khamenei emphasized that these Syrians should stand firm against those he believes are responsible for the insecurity in the country. He reiterated accusations that the U.S. and Israel were behind the instability in Syria, claiming they aimed to exploit the country’s resources. Iran has been a key supporter of Assad’s regime during Syria's civil war, which began after Assad's violent crackdown on protests. Syria has also served as a critical route for Iranian support to Hezbollah. Khamenei's remarks came after a year of significant losses for Iran's regional allies, including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, which was forced to agree to a ceasefire after heavy Israeli strikes. Despite the setbacks, Khamenei denied that groups like Hezbollah and Hamas act as Iranian proxies, asserting that these groups fight due to their own convictions. He further stated that if Iran ever needed to take action, it would not rely on proxy forces.The post Iran’s Khamenei Predicts Syrian Youth Will Resist New Government first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/irans-khamenei-syrian-youth-resist-new-government/	2024-12-23T04:02:33-08:00	
Khamenei Denies Having or Needing Regional Proxy Forces	Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei rejected claims that militant groups in the region act as Tehran's proxies, stating that if Iran needed to take action, it would not rely on them. His comments came amid significant losses for Iran-backed groups such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, both of which faced defeats in their ongoing conflicts with Israel. Additionally, the fall of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, a key ally in Iran’s so-called axis of resistance, added to the regional shifts. Khamenei insisted that groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, and Yemen's Houthi rebels are motivated by their own beliefs, not by Iran's influence. He emphasized that these groups fight because of their faith, not as part of a proxy network for Tehran. Khamenei further dismissed American claims that Iran had lost control over its regional proxies, asserting that Iran would not need proxy forces if it chose to take action. The collapse of Assad’s regime earlier this month marked a significant shift in the regional balance, as Assad had long been a key partner for Iran, especially in supporting Hezbollah. Khamenei expressed confidence that Syria would soon see the rise of a strong, independent group of fighters, predicting that Syria’s youth, who have nothing to lose, would form this group. He also accused the United States of attempting to destabilize Iran, promising that the Iranian people would reject any foreign influence or attempts to interfere with their sovereignty.The post Khamenei Denies Having or Needing Regional Proxy Forces first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/khamenei-denies-needing-proxy-forces/	2024-12-23T04:02:25-08:00	
Ex-Israeli Spies Reveal Hezbollah Pager Attack Details	Two recently retired senior Israeli intelligence officers revealed new details about a covert operation targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria, which utilized explosive devices hidden in pagers and walkie-talkies. The operation, years in the making, was carried out three months ago and was revealed in a segment on CBS’s '60 Minutes.' The operation began over a decade ago with walkie-talkies laced with explosives, which Hezbollah unwittingly purchased from Israel. The walkie-talkies weren’t detonated until September, a day after the pagers, which had been rigged to explode, were triggered. The explosive devices were part of a larger plan to strike Hezbollah militants. In 2022, Mossad learned that Hezbollah was acquiring pagers from a Taiwanese company and decided to turn the situation to their advantage. The pagers were altered to accommodate explosives and tested to ensure they would cause harm only to the target while minimizing risk to bystanders. Mossad also experimented with various ringtones to ensure the pagers would be noticed. The operation also involved deceiving Hezbollah into thinking it was purchasing equipment from legitimate suppliers, using false ads and shell companies to mislead the Taiwanese firm. The pagers were marketed as rugged and efficient, convincing Hezbollah to buy a new, larger model with hidden explosives. By September, Hezbollah had acquired thousands of these altered pagers. The explosive devices were detonated on September 17, causing widespread panic. The following day, Mossad activated the walkie-talkies, some of which exploded during funerals for victims of the pager explosions. The explosions were intended to send a powerful message to Hezbollah, demonstrating Israel’s technological superiority and the cost of challenging Israel. The explosions caused significant psychological impact in Lebanon, with people fearing further attacks from everyday objects. Israel’s air strikes soon followed, leading to heavy casualties, including the assassination of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. The operation concluded with a ceasefire by November. The Israeli agents behind the operation explained that the aim was not just to kill but to cripple Hezbollah, creating visible, long-lasting reminders of Israel’s power in the region. The fear instilled in the population, they explained, was part of the psychological warfare that Israel hoped to maintain as a deterrent.The post Ex-Israeli Spies Reveal Hezbollah Pager Attack Details first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/ex-israeli-spies-hezbollah-pager-attack-details/	2024-12-23T04:02:10-08:00	
Yemeni Missile Strikes Tel Aviv, Say Israel and Houthis	A missile fired from Yemen hit Tel Aviv early on Saturday, marking a rare failure in the city's missile defense system. Israeli authorities confirmed that the missile landed in the southern Jaffa area of Tel Aviv. Despite air defense efforts, the missile was not intercepted, and sirens sounded before the impact. Emergency services reported that more than a dozen people sustained minor injuries, primarily from broken glass, but no fatalities occurred. The Houthis in Yemen, backed by Iran, claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that they launched a hypersonic ballistic missile, named 'Palestine 2,' which accurately struck its target. At least 16 people were treated for minor injuries, while others sought shelter or suffered panic-related symptoms. One resident described the explosion as terrifying, with windows shattered in nearby buildings. Tel Aviv, Israel's commercial and diplomatic hub, is rarely hit by direct missile strikes due to the country's advanced air defense system. However, since the war with Hamas began in October 2023, Israel has faced missile attacks from other Iran-backed groups, including Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. Most of these missiles have been intercepted by Israel's defense systems. The Houthis have been targeting ships in the Red Sea in response to the ongoing Gaza conflict, and their attacks, alongside those from Hamas and Hezbollah, are part of a broader Iran-led alliance. This coalition has vowed to continue striking Israel and its allies until a ceasefire is achieved in Gaza. The attacks intensified following Hamas's deadly assault on Israel on October 7, 2023, which sparked the ongoing conflict.The post Yemeni Missile Strikes Tel Aviv, Say Israel and Houthis first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/yemeni-missile-strikes-tel-aviv/	2024-12-22T01:07:16-08:00	
Israel and Hamas Near Ceasefire Deal: Key Sticking Points Reveale...	Israel and Hamas are reportedly closer to reaching a ceasefire agreement that could end the 14-month war in Gaza and facilitate the return of numerous hostages. However, previous attempts to reach a deal have failed due to unresolved issues, and this round of talks faces its own set of challenges. The proposed ceasefire deal would be implemented in stages, starting with a halt in fighting, followed by the exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and a significant increase in humanitarian aid to Gaza. The final phase would see the release of any remaining hostages, the end of the war, and discussions on Gaza's reconstruction. Although there is optimism on both sides, key obstacles remain, particularly regarding which hostages and prisoners will be exchanged and the status of Israeli troops in Gaza. Israeli officials are working on determining the list of hostages to be released in the first phase, which is expected to focus on women, the elderly, and those with medical conditions. Negotiations also continue over the exact number of Palestinian prisoners to be freed, with Hamas pushing for the release of high-profile detainees. In addition, Israel’s decision to withdraw troops from Palestinian population centers is another sticking point. While there is an expectation that some displaced people will be allowed to return to Gaza, the specifics of the withdrawal and the areas from which people can return remain unresolved. Israel is particularly concerned about the return of displaced people to areas near the Israeli border, fearing that militant activity could resume from those regions. The ongoing talks are also complicated by political pressures in Israel, with some factions opposing concessions, particularly the release of prisoners involved in violent attacks. Furthermore, some Israeli officials suggest more drastic measures, including proposals to empty northern Gaza and cut off humanitarian aid in a bid to eliminate militants. U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, have expressed hope that an agreement could be finalized before President Joe Biden’s term ends on January 20, 2025, aiming to bring relief to the people of Gaza and secure the release of hostages.The post Israel and Hamas Near Ceasefire Deal: Key Sticking Points Revealed first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-hamas-ceasefire-key-points/	2024-12-21T08:27:47-08:00	
Erdogan Calls for Eradication of IS and Kurdish Fighters in Syria	Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared on Friday that it is essential to eliminate groups that threaten Syria's survival, particularly the Islamic State (ISIS) and Kurdish fighters. Erdogan emphasized the need to neutralize terrorist organizations like ISIS and the PKK, as well as their affiliates, to ensure Syria's stability. He referred to the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which include the Kurdish YPG militia, as a terror organization due to its links with the PKK, a group involved in a long-standing insurgency against Turkey. While the SDF played a critical role in the fight against ISIS in Syria, especially in 2019, the United States views them as essential to preventing the resurgence of jihadist forces. Erdogan stressed that Turkey is taking preventive actions against groups that pose a risk to its security and expressed confidence that Syria’s new leadership would refrain from collaborating with such organizations. He warned that the leaders of these groups, including ISIS and the PKK-YPG, would be swiftly targeted. Furthermore, Erdogan mentioned that Turkey’s foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, is set to visit Damascus soon, following a recent meeting between Turkey's spy chief, Ibrahim Kalin, and the leadership of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) in Syria, which occurred just days after the fall of Assad's government.The post Erdogan Calls for Eradication of IS and Kurdish Fighters in Syria first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/erdogan-eradication-is-kurdish-fighters-syria/	2024-12-21T08:27:35-08:00	
Yemeni Rocket Strikes Tel Aviv, 16 Injured	The Israeli military reported that a rocket launched from Yemen struck an area near Tel Aviv early on Saturday, injuring 16 people with glass shards from nearby windows. Another 14 individuals sustained minor injuries while rushing to shelters when air raid sirens were activated shortly before the attack at 4 a.m. local time. This incident follows Israeli airstrikes on Yemen's Houthi-controlled capital, Sanaa, and the port city of Hodeida two days prior, which resulted in at least nine deaths. These strikes were retaliation for a missile attack by the Houthis that hit an Israeli school building. The Houthis also claimed responsibility for a drone strike on an unspecified Israeli military target earlier in the week. The Israeli military has reported that the Iran-backed Houthis have launched over 200 missiles and drones during the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Additionally, the Houthis have been targeting shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, promising to continue these attacks until a ceasefire is established in Gaza. The recent Israeli strikes have significantly damaged the Houthi-controlled Red Sea ports, particularly the Hodeida port, which is crucial for food shipments to Yemen. The United Nations has expressed concern over the escalating violence, warning that both sides' actions could further destabilize the region and undermine ongoing U.N. mediation efforts.The post Yemeni Rocket Strikes Tel Aviv, 16 Injured first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/yemeni-rocket-strikes-tel-aviv-16-injured/	2024-12-21T08:27:24-08:00	
Two Dead, 60 Injured as Car Plows into Germany Christmas Market	A tragic incident occurred on Friday in the German city of Magdeburg when a car drove into a busy outdoor Christmas market, resulting in the deaths of at least two people and injuries to over 60 others. Authorities have labeled the incident a deliberate attack. The car crashed into the market around 7 p.m., a peak time for holiday shoppers, and the driver was promptly arrested at the scene. Footage of the arrest showed the suspect lying on the ground as officers took him into custody. The two confirmed fatalities were an adult and a child, but there are concerns that more lives may have been lost, as 15 people sustained serious injuries. The attack shocked the city, with the mayor visibly emotional and the event tarnishing a festive tradition that dates back centuries. The tragedy prompted several other German cities to cancel their weekend Christmas markets in solidarity. The suspect, a 50-year-old Saudi doctor who has lived in Germany since 2006, was practicing in Bernburg, a town near Magdeburg. Officials confirmed he acted alone, and there was no ongoing threat to the city. This incident is a grim reminder of a similar attack in 2016, when an Islamic extremist drove a truck into a Christmas market in Berlin, killing 13 people. In the wake of the attack, the German government and public figures expressed their condolences, with flags to be lowered to half-staff across Saxony-Anhalt. International leaders also voiced support, including German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and U.S. Vice President-elect JD Vance. Magdeburg’s mayor announced plans for a memorial at the city's cathedral, and a minute of silence was held at a football match later that evening in honor of the victims.The post Two Dead, 60 Injured as Car Plows into Germany Christmas Market first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/two-dead-60-injured-car-plows-germany-christmas-market/	2024-12-21T08:27:14-08:00	
Three Bodies Found After Israeli Strike on Nasrallah	Lebanese rescuers recovered three bodies from the ruins of a building in Beirut that was hit by an Israeli airstrike in September, which also resulted in the death of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. The health ministry has not provided a confirmed death toll for the strike that destroyed several buildings in Haret Hreik, a Hezbollah stronghold in southern Beirut. On Friday morning, rescuers began searching for seven people still missing at the site, with the National News Agency reporting the recovery of three bodies. These remains were transported to Rafik Hariri University Hospital in Beirut for DNA testing to confirm their identities. Search efforts continued for other missing individuals. The Israeli airstrike on September 27 targeted Nasrallah in an underground bunker within a residential area. Nasrallah was killed along with four others, including Hezbollah's southern Lebanon commander and a senior member of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. His burial took place at a secret location to avoid Israeli targeting of his funeral. Although a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah began on November 27, bringing an end to a conflict that claimed over 4,000 lives in Lebanon, Israeli airstrikes have continued to kill more than 20 people in the country since that time. Both Israel and Hezbollah have accused each other of violating the ceasefire agreement.The post Three Bodies Found After Israeli Strike on Nasrallah first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/three-bodies-found-israeli-strike-nasrallah/	2024-12-21T08:26:51-08:00	
Gemayel Vows No Revenge, Calls for Unity as Lebanon ‘Rises Again’	Kataeb leader Sami Gemayel stated on Friday that Hezbollah should understand that the Lebanese people will no longer accept being under its control or treated as second-class citizens. He emphasized that his stance is not about seeking revenge, nor about excluding or isolating anyone, including Hezbollah, Amal, and their supporters. However, he made it clear that all groups must abide by the law and the constitution. He also stressed that the era of chaos has ended, and moving forward, no group other than the Lebanese army should be allowed to hold arms. Gemayel, in preparation for the presidential vote set for January 9, reiterated that the next president must uphold the ceasefire agreement. However, his party and other opposition groups have not yet agreed on a candidate. The ceasefire agreement from November stipulates that the Lebanese army and UN peacekeepers will be the only armed forces in southern Lebanon, an area that has historically been under Hezbollah's influence. Gemayel expressed optimism for Lebanon's future, declaring that the obstacles which once hindered state-building and isolated Lebanon from its Arab neighbors and the international community are now gone.The post Gemayel Vows No Revenge, Calls for Unity as Lebanon ‘Rises Again’ first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/gemayel-no-revenge-calls-unity/	2024-12-20T08:51:43-08:00	
US Delegation Holds Talks with al-Jolani in Damascus	U.S. diplomats met Syria's newly appointed leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, on Friday, marking the first official contact since the fall of former president Bashar al-Assad. This meeting comes amid international concerns over the direction of Syria’s leadership, with many powers seeking assurances that the country’s new authorities will be moderate and inclusive, particularly in regard to the rights of minorities, women, and the Kurdish population. The rapid offensive that led to Assad's removal was spearheaded by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a group originally linked to al-Qaeda but which has recently presented itself as more moderate. The unexpected shift in power has forced foreign governments, especially the U.S., to reassess their policies, given HTS is considered a terrorist organization by some countries. Although the U.S. delegation had planned a press conference, it was canceled due to security concerns. The diplomats are also engaging with various Syrian civil society groups and minorities. Among those in the U.S. delegation are Barbara Leaf, a senior State Department official, and a representative handling cases involving American hostages, including Austin Tice, a journalist abducted in Syria in 2012. In parallel, international discussions have emphasized the need for a non-sectarian, inclusive Syrian government. This was echoed at a recent summit in Aqaba, Jordan, where various regional powers, including Turkey, stressed the importance of maintaining Syria’s territorial integrity. Turkey, which opposed Assad during the war, also voiced concerns about Kurdish forces in Syria, which it considers linked to the PKK, a designated terrorist group. Kurdish-led forces in northeastern Syria, under the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), have been a key player in the region, but their future remains uncertain, especially in the face of Turkish pressure. While Kurdish leaders welcomed the fall of Assad, many fear further Turkish military action in their territories. In Syria itself, protests erupted in response to comments by the interim government, particularly regarding the role of women in politics. A spokesperson for the new government suggested that female representation in ministries or parliament was premature. This sparked outrage, with women leaders vowing to hold the government accountable for any move that undermines gender equality. International bodies, like the UN's migration agency, have also called for increased empowerment of women in Syria’s rebuilding process. The civil war, which claimed over 500,000 lives, has led to widespread displacement and human rights abuses. Following Assad's ousting, mass graves and prisons holding thousands of victims of torture have been uncovered, further highlighting the need for accountability and reconciliation as Syria moves forward.The post US Delegation Holds Talks with al-Jolani in Damascus first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-delegation-talks-al-jolani-damascus/	2024-12-20T08:51:34-08:00	
Turkey, Iran Leaders Hold Talks at Cairo Muslim Summit	The leaders of Turkey and Iran held a meeting in Cairo at a summit involving eight Muslim-majority countries, marking their first direct talks since the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Historically, Turkey and Iran have supported opposing sides in Syria’s prolonged civil war, with Turkey backing the opposition and Iran standing by Assad’s government. During the summit, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan emphasized Turkey’s desire for a stable and secure Syria, where terrorism is eradicated and the country’s territorial integrity is preserved. The Turkish presidency issued a statement in which Erdogan also stressed the importance of maintaining Syria’s unity. Similarly, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian’s office issued a statement underscoring Iran’s position against any threat to Syria’s territorial integrity. He also called for Muslim nations to take a strong stance against Israel's actions in the region. This meeting took place amid a backdrop of regional instability, including the ongoing war in Gaza, a fragile ceasefire in Lebanon, and unrest in Syria. Pezeshkian, addressing the summit, described it as a moral obligation for Muslim countries to act to prevent further harm in conflict zones. The summit, held by the D-8 Organization for Economic Cooperation (also known as the Developing-8), marked the first visit of an Iranian president to Egypt since Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s visit in 2013. Diplomatic relations between Egypt and Iran, which have been strained for years, have recently improved, particularly after Egypt took on a mediator role in the Gaza conflict. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi visited Egypt in October, and Egypt’s Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty had traveled to Tehran earlier in July. This is also Erdogan’s second visit to Egypt this year, with his previous visit in February being his first trip to the country as president since 2012, when he was prime minister.The post Turkey, Iran Leaders Hold Talks at Cairo Muslim Summit first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/turkey-iran-leaders-talks-cairo-muslim-summit/	2024-12-20T08:51:25-08:00	
Israeli Army Withdraws from Bani Hayyan, Lebanese Forces Deploy A...	Israeli forces pulled out of the southern town of Bani Hayyan on Friday, two days after they entered the area. They moved their operations toward Markaba after carrying out demolitions, including bulldozing homes and clearing roads. The Bani Hayyan Municipality reported on Thursday that an elderly woman inside the town had gone missing during the incursion, and her whereabouts remain unclear. In addition to the actions in Bani Hayyan, Israeli forces also conducted detonations in Naqoura, a town in southern Lebanon. Meanwhile, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and the Lebanese Army deployed on Friday in the valleys along the Litani River, between several locations, including Deir Siryan, Alman, al-Qusayr, and Zawtar al-Sharqiyeh. This deployment followed recommendations from the committee overseeing the ceasefire. The Lebanese Army and UNIFIL are setting up checkpoints and other fixed positions at the entrances to the southern Litani sector and along the riverbanks, stretching from Marjayoun to al-Qasmiyeh.The post Israeli Army Withdraws from Bani Hayyan, Lebanese Forces Deploy Along Litani first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-army-withdraws-bani-hayyan/	2024-12-20T08:51:15-08:00	
Army Chief Joseph Aoun: Jumblat’s Pick, Gemayel’s Ally	Former leader of the Progressive Socialist Party, Walid Jumblat, along with the Democratic Gathering bloc, has officially endorsed Army Chief General Joseph Aoun for the upcoming presidential election, set for January 9. Jumblat's announcement makes him one of the first political figures to publicly back a candidate. Jumblat's support for Aoun stems from his belief in the army's crucial role in Lebanon’s stability. He praised Aoun for his leadership, emphasizing that the army is an essential institution for the security and stability of the country. The Lebanese army holds a respected position in Lebanon, known for bridging divides in a politically fragmented society. Recently, the army has played a key role in the implementation of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon, particularly in southern Lebanon, where the Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeepers are now the only armed entities allowed. Hezbollah, a powerful political and military group, has stated that it is cooperating with the army in this effort. The situation is marked by a stark divide: Hezbollah and its ally Amal support a presidential candidate who would protect their influence and maintain Hezbollah's right to defend Lebanon. In contrast, opposition forces advocate for a president who would disarm Hezbollah and ensure that only the Lebanese army is responsible for defending the country and maintaining order, particularly in southern Lebanon, which borders Israel. Kataeb leader Sami Gemayel, speaking on behalf of the opposition, expressed support for a president committed to enforcing the ceasefire agreement and ensuring that only the Lebanese army possesses weapons. However, no opposition candidate has been agreed upon as of yet. The ceasefire, which was brokered by the U.S. and France, calls for the withdrawal of Hezbollah and Israeli forces from southern Lebanon, with the Lebanese army taking full control in the area. This move aims to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which was initially passed in 2006 to end hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel. Resolution 1701 stipulates that the Lebanese state, in partnership with the U.N., should be the exclusive armed presence in the region, a provision that has not been fully enforced until now. Gemayel confirmed that the opposition is still in the process of consulting with each other, but reiterated that they will not announce their presidential candidate until these talks conclude.The post Army Chief Joseph Aoun: Jumblat’s Pick, Gemayel’s Ally first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/joseph-aoun-jumblats-pick-gemayels-ally/	2024-12-20T08:51:08-08:00	
UN Chief Sees Hope in Syria, Urges End to Israeli Strikes	U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed hope for Syria on Thursday, noting a 'flame of hope' following the downfall of President Bashar al-Assad's regime, but also acknowledged the significant hurdles ahead. Guterres emphasized that the Middle East is engulfed in numerous conflicts, yet Syria's situation offers a glimpse of potential progress that must not be extinguished. He also criticized Israel's ongoing air strikes on Syrian military targets, including air force and naval installations, calling them violations of Syria’s sovereignty. He called for an end to these strikes, urging that they must cease immediately. Ahead of a U.N. Security Council meeting, Guterres suggested that the international community consider easing sanctions on Syria as a first step towards fostering solidarity with the Syrian people. However, he noted that this would only be feasible once conditions are in place to remove all sanctions. In Syria, the HTS, an Islamist group with Al-Qaeda roots and support from Turkey, recently seized control of Damascus. They have pledged to protect minorities following the ousting of Assad's government. Despite these changes, the international community remains cautious, hesitant to lift sanctions or take further steps until it is clear how the new authorities will govern the country.The post UN Chief Sees Hope in Syria, Urges End to Israeli Strikes first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/un-hope-syria-urges-end-israeli-strikes/	2024-12-19T10:10:17-08:00	
Israel Hits Yemen Capital After Houthi Missile Targets Central Is...	Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for a missile attack on Israel Thursday, which the Israeli military intercepted before it could reach its territory. Israel responded with airstrikes targeting Houthi infrastructure in Yemen, including power stations, oil facilities, and ports, resulting in casualties. The Houthis, who have repeatedly targeted Israel since the Gaza conflict began, are part of the Iran-backed 'axis of resistance,' which also includes Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu warned that the Houthis would face severe consequences for their actions. He described the group as one of the last remaining arms of Iran's influence, following the weakening of Hezbollah and the fall of the Assad regime in Syria. Israel’s military stated that the intercepted missile was launched from Yemen, triggering sirens in parts of Israel. Israel’s retaliatory strikes reportedly caused significant damage in Yemen, including casualties at Hodeida and Sanaa. While the Iranian government condemned Israel’s actions as a violation of international law, Palestinian militant group Hamas also criticized Israel’s response. This missile interception marked the second this week after a similar incident on Monday, and the Houthis have vowed to continue their operations in support of Palestinians in Gaza. They have previously attacked shipping routes in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, leading to retaliatory strikes by U.S. and British forces. Israeli officials have expressed concerns that the Houthis, supported by Iran, are emerging as a growing global threat.The post Israel Hits Yemen Capital After Houthi Missile Targets Central Israel first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-hits-yemen-capital-houthi-missile/	2024-12-19T10:10:07-08:00	
Latest Updates on Gaza Ceasefire Talks	Efforts to reach a truce and hostage release agreement between Israel and Hamas have encountered multiple challenges, but recent negotiations have sparked hope for a resolution. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed optimism about achieving a ceasefire in Gaza, following a 'cautious optimism' statement from Washington about an 'imminent deal.' These hopes arise from reported indirect negotiations in Qatar, facilitated by Qatar, Egypt, and the United States. Diplomatic sources indicate that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's recent assertion for a deal before his January 20 inauguration has influenced the negotiations. Hamas, feeling isolated due to the weakening of its Lebanese ally Hezbollah and the fall of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, is eager to secure an agreement by year-end. This sentiment is echoed by the hope of many who view a deal as a 'perfect Christmas gift.' The death of Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar has shifted negotiation responsibilities to Hamas leaders abroad, known for their pragmatic approach. According to a high-ranking Hamas official, talks have reached the 'final details' stage, with an announcement expected from Qatar and Egypt once negotiations conclude. An Israeli government spokesman refrained from commenting on the proposed deal, suggesting that keeping details under wraps is beneficial. The proposed deal involves a ceasefire and a phased release of hostages. Initially, Israeli civilian hostages and female soldiers would be released in exchange for numerous Palestinian prisoners. Israel would also partially withdraw its forces from specific areas in Gaza, allowing displaced residents to return under Israeli army monitoring. Subsequent phases would involve the release of Israeli male soldiers, the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from most areas, and the start of reconstruction efforts in Gaza. The Rafah crossing on the Egyptian border would be jointly managed by the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, and the European Union. Despite the progress, significant obstacles remain. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has consistently opposed withdrawing Israeli troops from the Philadelphi Corridor, and Israel has stated it will not allow Hamas to govern Gaza post-war. Additionally, the governance of Gaza remains a contentious issue within the Palestinian leadership. While a Hamas official mentioned that international entities would guarantee the agreement's implementation, there has been no confirmation from these parties.The post Latest Updates on Gaza Ceasefire Talks first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/latest-updates-gaza-ceasefire-talks/	2024-12-19T10:09:56-08:00	
Aoun Only Serious Candidate for January Session	The Democratic Gathering bloc has become the first to officially declare its presidential candidate ahead of the election session set for January 9. This session may potentially conclude over two years of presidential vacancy. On Wednesday, following a meeting, the Democratic Gathering bloc announced that its MPs would vote for Army chief Gen. Joseph Aoun on January 9. Former Progressive Socialist Party leader Walid Jumblat, who attended the meeting, had previously met with Speaker Nabih Berri and tried to persuade him to support Aoun. However, these efforts, as well as attempts to convince Free Patriotic Movement leader Jebran Bassil, were unsuccessful. According to MTV, Berri's reservations about Aoun stem from his 'sharp' character and 'sectarian approach,' rather than his ties to the U.S. Joseph Aoun, considered a strong candidate for the presidency, faces the challenge of enforcing the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire, a task heavily dependent on his troops' deployment in the south. Despite difficulties, Aoun is seen as a figure of personal integrity and national dedication, respected for his leadership in driving out the Islamic State from the Syrian border region. He has led the army since 2017, with his mandate extended twice, and maintains good relations across the political spectrum, including with Hezbollah and foreign countries. Although various politicians and parties have suggested Aoun as a presidential candidate, only the Democratic Gathering bloc has officially endorsed him for the January 9 session. Opposition blocs have considered other candidates like Michel Mouawad, Jihad Azour, Salah Honein, Neemat Frem, and Nassif Hitti, with Azour being their latest official candidate. Hezbollah and Amal have consistently backed Suleiman Franjieh. The opposition remains undecided on its candidate for January 9. Meanwhile, Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea has been in contact with Berri and expressed his willingness to run for president if he gains enough support. Kataeb leader Sami Gemayel, who supports Aoun, has also indicated a potential vote for Geagea. In addition to Aoun, other potential candidates include ex-ambassador to the Vatican George Khoury, MP Farid Haykal al-Khazen, General Security chief Maj. Gen. Elias Bayssari, ex-minister Ziad Baroud, Jean-Louis Cardahi, and banker Samir Assaf, with varying support from different factions and countries. Despite accusations of inflexibility, Hezbollah and Amal, known as the Shiite Duo, have called for dialogue and a consensus president. Franjieh, still running for the presidency, expressed openness to any suitable candidate who can build the state, emphasizing the need for agreement with allies like Hezbollah.The post Aoun Only Serious Candidate for January Session first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/aoun-serious-candidate-january-session/	2024-12-19T10:09:46-08:00	
Report: Israel Refuses to Halt Violations or Withdraw	The five-party committee responsible for overseeing the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire held its second meeting on Wednesday. Sources informed al-Akhbar newspaper that the Israeli side did not provide a specific timeline for a complete withdrawal from southern Lebanon and did not commit to stopping ceasefire violations. Lebanese Army officers insisted on an initial withdrawal from certain areas, pointing out that over 20 days had passed since the agreement was implemented. However, the Israeli officers only noted the Lebanese demands without making any promises regarding immediate actions. Regarding the Lebanese delegation's complaints about ongoing territorial, naval, and aerial violations, the Israeli delegation stated that they would review these concerns, as reported by al-Akhbar.The post Report: Israel Refuses to Halt Violations or Withdraw first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-refuses-halt-violations-withdraw/	2024-12-19T10:09:38-08:00	
Netanyahu: ‘We Will Stay’ from Strategic Syrian Peak	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Israeli forces will maintain their position in a buffer zone along the Syrian border, which was seized following the removal of President Bashar al-Assad, until a new arrangement is established to secure Israel's safety. Netanyahu made the statement on Tuesday while visiting Mount Hermon, located inside Syria near the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights. This marked the first time an Israeli leader had visited this area. Netanyahu recalled visiting the mountaintop as a soldier 53 years ago, noting that the location's strategic importance for Israel had grown in light of recent developments. Israel captured the buffer zone, a demilitarized area of roughly 400 square kilometers, just days after Assad was ousted by rebels. This move has drawn criticism, with accusations that Israel is exploiting the instability in Syria to annex land and violate a 1974 ceasefire agreement. Netanyahu emphasized that Israeli forces would stay in the area until a new arrangement that ensures security is reached. Defense Minister Israel Katz, who accompanied Netanyahu, ordered the military to establish fortifications, preparing for a potentially prolonged presence. Katz described the summit as Israel’s 'eyes' for identifying threats in the region. The U.N. had established the buffer zone after the 1973 Middle East war, and a peacekeeping force had patrolled the area. A U.N. spokesperson condemned Israel's actions, asserting that the presence of Israeli troops in the zone violated the agreement and amounted to occupation. While no immediate response from the opposition group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) or other Arab states was reported, the situation has further complicated Israel's relations in the region. Meanwhile, as Syria navigates its post-Assad era, a U.N. official indicated that militant leaders are committed to expanding humanitarian aid efforts. Syrian authorities, led by the HTS, pledged to support aid delivery from neighboring countries. Germany and the U.S. have also engaged with these insurgent leaders, discussing Syria’s political transition and human rights protections. In other news, the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces proposed establishing a demilitarized zone in the Kurdish-majority town of Kobani in northern Syria. This proposal comes amid tensions with Turkey, which views Kurdish forces as terrorist groups. Furthermore, mass graves containing the bodies of over 30 Syrians, victims of Assad's regime, were uncovered in the village of Izraa, intensifying the ongoing humanitarian crisis. Families of the missing had hoped to find their loved ones alive, but instead discovered victims who had been tortured and killed under the regime. On the diplomatic front, Qatar reopened its embassy in Damascus, a significant move after severing ties with Assad's government 13 years ago. Other embassies, including those of France and Turkey, have also resumed diplomatic relations with Syria, signaling shifts in international stance following Assad’s removal.The post Netanyahu: ‘We Will Stay’ from Strategic Syrian Peak first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/netanyahu-we-stay-strategic-syrian-peak/	2024-12-18T10:44:25-08:00	
UN Council Urges ‘Inclusive, Syrian-Led’ Political Process	The UN Security Council has called for a Syrian-led political process following the removal of President Bashar al-Assad. In its first statement on the situation in Syria, the Council emphasized the need for an inclusive political process that should culminate in elections. It also stressed the importance of respecting Syria's sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity. The statement, released late on Tuesday, urged that Syrians be allowed to determine their own future through peaceful and democratic means, as outlined in a 2015 resolution that calls for a new constitution and U.N.-supervised elections. The UN will facilitate the process, supporting efforts by UN envoy Geir Pedersen. Although the statement did not mention the removal of Assad on December 8, which occurred after an operation led by the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, it reiterated ongoing support for the U.N. peacekeeping force monitoring the Israel-Syria border. The Security Council also urged adherence to the 1974 Disengagement Agreement, which established a demilitarized zone to reduce tensions. Furthermore, the statement underscored the importance of fighting terrorism in Syria, particularly preventing the resurgence of the Islamic State (IS), which once controlled large areas of Iraq and Syria before being driven out in 2019. The Council also called for Syria to uphold human rights and international humanitarian law, ensuring justice for victims and access to aid for those in need.The post UN Council Urges ‘Inclusive, Syrian-Led’ Political Process first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/un-urges-inclusive-syrian-led-process/	2024-12-18T10:44:09-08:00	
Israel Army: Settlers Crossed into Lebanon’s Maroun al-Ras in Dec...	A group of Israeli settlers briefly crossed into Lebanon before being removed by the military, according to reports on Wednesday. The settlers, part of the Uri Tzafon movement, which advocates for Israeli settlement in southern Lebanon, were photographed on Saturday with signs and tents inside Lebanese territory, while Israeli soldiers were present. Initially, the military denied the reports but later confirmed that civilians had crossed the border by a few meters and were promptly removed. The military described the incident as serious and stated that it is investigating the breach. It emphasized that any attempt to approach or cross the border without coordination poses risks and disrupts the operations of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) in the area. The Uri Tzafon group, which claims that the area around the Lebanese village of Maroun al-Ras is home to an ancient Hebrew settlement, had previously crossed the border in early December, setting up tents, planting trees, and establishing a memorial for an Israeli soldier killed in Lebanon in October. This incident follows similar breaches at the Gaza border since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023. The Israeli settler movement has been emboldened by the country's far-right government and is now focusing on expanding into southern Lebanon and northern Gaza.The post Israel Army: Settlers Crossed into Lebanon’s Maroun al-Ras in December first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/settlers-crossed-lebanons-maroun-al-ras-december/	2024-12-18T10:44:02-08:00	
Jumblat Seeks Berri’s Support for Army Chief Amid Presidential Ta...	Former Progressive Socialist Party leader Walid Jumblat has reportedly attempted to convince Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri to support the election of Army chief General Joseph Aoun as Lebanon's president. Jumblat met with Berri on Monday, expressing optimism about electing a president during the session scheduled for January 9. According to reports, after his meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron in France, Jumblat informed Berri that Western powers are inclined toward Aoun’s election, although Paris prefers figures like banker Samir Assaf or former minister Ziad Baroud. However, they would not oppose Aoun’s candidacy if consensus can be reached. Berri reportedly conditioned his support for Aoun on the candidate’s willingness to protect the 'resistance,' a reference to Hezbollah. However, Berri later clarified that he is not entirely opposed to Aoun’s election but wants to consult with Hezbollah before making a decision. On a different front, MP Farid Haykal al-Khazen, another presidential hopeful, met with Maronite Patriarch Beshara al-Rahi to discuss the presidential election. Al-Khazen has been working to bridge gaps between various political blocs to reach an agreement on a presidential candidate, emphasizing the importance of electing a president in the January 9 session to avoid further political vacuum. Maronite Patriarch al-Rahi also met with Free Patriotic Movement (FPM) MP George Atallah, as the FPM continues consultations to build consensus among different political parties. Lebanon currently has several candidates for the presidency, including Aoun, former ambassador to the Vatican and army intelligence chief Brigadier General George Khoury, MP Farid Haykal al-Khazen, General Security chief Major General Elias Bayssari, former ministers Ziad Baroud, Jean-Louis Cardahi, Jihad Azour, and others. Different political factions have expressed varying support for these candidates. The FPM, led by Jebran Bassil, backs Khoury, Bayssari, and Baroud, while Speaker Berri supports Khoury, Bayssari, and al-Khazen. The opposition bloc backs candidates like Aoun, Azour, and Hitti. Meanwhile, regional powers have also shown differing preferences. The U.S. and Saudi Arabia are reportedly backing Aoun, while France favors Assaf, Baroud, and Hitti. Qatar reportedly supports Bayssari. These countries, alongside Egypt, have been working to resolve the deadlock over Lebanon’s presidential election, as the country has been without a head of state for more than two years due to a standoff between pro- and anti-Hezbollah factions in parliament. Regarding the possibility of other candidates, Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea has expressed his willingness to run for president if he can secure enough political support. He also suggested that early parliamentary elections could help bring about a new phase in Lebanon’s political landscape. Kataeb leader Sami Gemayel, who supports Aoun, mentioned that he would not hesitate to vote for Geagea if he decides to run, though he also hinted at his own potential candidacy, stressing that the priority at present is to address Lebanon's crisis.The post Jumblat Seeks Berri’s Support for Army Chief Amid Presidential Talks first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/jumblat-berris-support-army-chief/	2024-12-18T10:43:52-08:00	
Mikati Meets Erdogan in Turkey	Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara on Wednesday to discuss recent developments in Syria and southern Lebanon. Mikati was accompanied by a delegation, including a representative from the Lebanese Army and Lebanon's ambassador to Turkey. During the meeting, Mikati reportedly planned to address the issue of land demarcation between Lebanon and Syria following the potential removal of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Additionally, according to sources from al-Joumhouria newspaper, Mikati intended to discuss the future of Syrian-Lebanese relations and the fate of Lebanese individuals who have been missing in Syrian prisons. The issue has gained attention since the release of a Lebanese man who had been missing for 40 years after being freed by Syrian rebels in Hama last week. This has sparked increased calls from Lebanese families for information about their relatives, who have been presumed detained in Syrian prisons since Lebanon’s civil war when Syrian forces were present in Lebanon. Mikati also planned to talk with Turkish officials about the situation in southern Lebanon, especially after a ceasefire agreement was reached at the end of November.The post Mikati Meets Erdogan in Turkey first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/mikati-meets-erdogan-turkey/	2024-12-18T10:43:44-08:00	
US Bombs Houthi Military Facility in Yemen’s Capital	The U.S. military announced on Tuesday that it carried out a bombing on a Houthi military facility in Yemen's capital, Sanaa. This latest strike is part of ongoing U.S.-led efforts targeting the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. According to Houthi media, the strike hit a section of the facility that includes the rebels' Defense Ministry. There have been no immediate reports of casualties from the attack. U.S. Central Command stated that the late Monday strike targeted a key command and control center used to coordinate Houthi operations, which include attacks on U.S. Navy and commercial ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Since October 2023, when the Israel-Hamas conflict began, the Houthis have launched multiple missile and drone attacks on merchant vessels. They have seized one vessel and sunk two, resulting in the deaths of four sailors. The Houthis claim to target ships connected to Israel, the U.S., or the U.K. in an effort to stop Israel’s actions in Gaza, although many of the ships attacked have no direct ties to the conflict, including those headed for Iran. The U.S. bombing took place shortly after the Houthis claimed to have launched a hypersonic missile at Israel. The missile triggered sirens across the Tel Aviv metropolitan area. The Israeli military reported intercepting the missile outside of Israel’s borders, though some debris from the intercepting missile fell onto a home in east Jerusalem.The post US Bombs Houthi Military Facility in Yemen’s Capital first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-bombs-houthi-facility-yemens-capital/	2024-12-17T05:37:33-08:00	
Bomb Kills Head of Russia’s Nuclear Defense Forces in Moscow	A bomb explosion near an apartment building in Moscow killed Lt. General Igor Kirillov, the head of Russia's nuclear and chemical defense forces, and his assistant early on Tuesday. According to Russia's Investigative Committee, the device was placed in a scooter and remotely detonated. The bomb's blast had the force of approximately 300 grams of TNT. Russian state news agency Tass reported that the explosion caused significant damage, including shattered windows and scorched brickwork. Authorities are treating the incident as a terrorist attack. Investigators and forensic teams are working at the scene to gather details about the crime. Kirillov, who was appointed to head Russia's nuclear defense forces in April 2017, had faced sanctions from several countries, including the U.K. and Canada, due to his involvement in the Ukraine conflict. The Ukrainian Security Services (SBU) had previously charged Kirillov on December 16 for allegedly using banned chemical weapons during Russia's military operations in Ukraine, which began in February 2022. The U.S. State Department had also reported the use of chloropicrin, a chemical weapon, against Ukrainian forces. The SBU has documented over 4,800 chemical weapon uses, particularly the K-1 combat grenades, since the war began. This bombing is part of a broader pattern of attacks against Russian officials. On December 9, an explosive device targeted Sergei Yevsyukov, the head of a prison in Donetsk, causing injuries and further highlighting the ongoing violence as Russia maintains control over parts of Ukraine.The post Bomb Kills Head of Russia’s Nuclear Defense Forces in Moscow first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/bomb-kills-head-russias-nuclear-defense-forces-moscow/	2024-12-17T05:37:24-08:00	
Israel and Hamas Move Closer to Ceasefire Deal	After months of stagnation, Israel and Hamas appear to be making progress toward a ceasefire to end their prolonged conflict, which has lasted for 14 months. Recently, key mediators from the U.S., Qatar, and Egypt have resumed talks, reporting increased willingness from both sides to reach an agreement. A significant development is Hamas's willingness to show more flexibility on the timing of an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, while Israel’s defense minister, Israel Katz, has expressed optimism, stating that a deal is closer than ever. Although critical details remain unresolved, there is a renewed sense of hope that had been absent for some time. This shift is attributed to several factors, including the heavy losses Hamas has suffered during the war, its growing isolation after Hezbollah’s ceasefire with Israel, and setbacks for Iran, which has been a key supporter of both Hamas and Hezbollah. Both the outgoing Biden administration and the incoming Trump administration in the U.S. have indicated a desire to finalize a deal before the inauguration of President Trump on January 20. According to Egyptian and Hamas officials, the ceasefire agreement would unfold in stages. The first phase would include a cessation of hostilities, the exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and a significant increase in humanitarian aid to Gaza. Israel asserts that Hamas is holding 100 hostages, with many believed to have died. The initial ceasefire phase would last between six and eight weeks. During this period, Hamas would release around 30 hostages, including several dual U.S.-Israeli citizens. In return, Israel would free hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including some serving long sentences for their involvement in violent attacks. The deal would also lead to a substantial increase in aid to Gaza, which has been devastated by the war. The territory has been facing a severe humanitarian crisis, with 90% of its 2.3 million residents displaced. The agreement would likely include the reopening of the Rafah crossing with Egypt, a critical passage for Palestinians seeking to leave Gaza, which has been closed since May due to the Israeli invasion. Mediators are exploring the possibility of resurrecting a 2005 agreement that allowed the Palestinian Authority to manage the Rafah crossing with European Union observers. This agreement collapsed in 2007 when Hamas took control of Gaza. As part of the first phase of the ceasefire, Israeli forces would begin withdrawing from some Palestinian population centers, allowing displaced Palestinians to return. However, Israeli troops would remain in certain areas, such as the strategic Philadelphi corridor along Gaza's border with Egypt. Negotiations would continue during the ceasefire to finalize a comprehensive agreement that would bring an end to the war, ensure a full Israeli withdrawal, and address the release of remaining hostages and bodies held by Hamas. Talks would also focus on the future governance of Gaza and the rebuilding process following the extensive destruction caused by the conflict.The post Israel and Hamas Move Closer to Ceasefire Deal first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-hamas-closer-ceasefire-deal/	2024-12-17T05:37:11-08:00	
Mikati: Israeli Violations to End Soon	Lebanese Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati pledged on Tuesday to put an end to Israel's violations of the ceasefire agreement. Israel has conducted frequent airstrikes, primarily targeting southern Lebanon, since the ceasefire began on November 27, resulting in 29 deaths and 27 injuries. Despite these breaches, the fragile truce remains largely intact, with Israel asserting its right to use force against any violations under the terms of its deal with Lebanon. Hezbollah MP Hassan Fadlallah criticized the Lebanese government's failure to address Israel's continued violations, urging more decisive action. Mikati responded by assuring that the violations would be halted soon, noting that Lebanon had 'turned the page on the war.' Recently, Israeli forces carried out a raid in a valley near al-Najjariyeh, south of Sidon, wounding three people. On Tuesday, the Israeli army destroyed houses and detonated explosives in the southern border towns of Yaroun, Kfarkila, and Naqoura, where Israeli troops remain stationed. As part of the ceasefire terms, Israel is required to withdraw its forces from Lebanon within 60 days. Meanwhile, Hezbollah must move its heavy weapons north of the Litani River to reduce tensions along the border.The post Mikati: Israeli Violations to End Soon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/mikati-israeli-violations-end-soon/	2024-12-17T05:36:47-08:00	
France Pledges Support for Syrians During Transition Amid Engagem...	A French diplomatic delegation visited the Syrian embassy in Damascus on Tuesday, marking the first such visit since Bashar al-Assad was ousted by Islamist-led rebels. French special envoy for Syria, Jean-Francois Guillaume, stated that France is preparing to support Syrians during their transition, hoping for a peaceful period ahead. The French flag was raised in the embassy for the first time since it was closed in 2012, signaling the significance of this visit. Guillaume emphasized that the delegation's goal was to establish contact with the de facto authorities in Damascus. Meanwhile, the European Commission's President, Ursula Von der Leyen, announced that the EU would increase direct engagement with Syria's new leadership. She stressed the importance of addressing the growing threat of the Islamic State's resurgence and underscored the necessity of continued dialogue with factions such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). Germany also took a step towards engaging with the new Syrian government. German diplomats held their first talks with the government installed by HTS, focusing on an inclusive transition process and the protection of minorities. Germany remains cautious, acknowledging HTS's origins in al-Qaida ideology but expressing a willingness to assess the group's actions moving forward. The country has been a primary destination for Syrian refugees in recent years. British diplomats also engaged with HTS leaders, including Ahmad al-Sharaa, during their visit to Damascus. The UK has not ruled out reconsidering its classification of HTS as a terrorist organization, but for now, officials continue to engage with the group. In a meeting with the West, al-Sharaa called for the lifting of sanctions and an end to Israeli airstrikes on Syria, highlighting the need for peace and stability in the region. The United Nations’ humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, also met with Syrian leaders, expressing cautious optimism about the potential for scaling up humanitarian support in the country. Fletcher, after meeting with HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, suggested that there is a foundation for increased aid, signaling a rare moment of hope amidst Syria’s prolonged crisis.The post France Pledges Support for Syrians During Transition Amid Engagement with New Rulers first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/france-support-syrians-transition/	2024-12-17T05:36:40-08:00

Syrian Rebel Force Deployed Near Damascus to Stop Looters	A rebel group was deployed to a village in southeastern Damascus to combat looters who had overrun a residential complex, stealing items and setting several apartments on fire. This action took place a week after the rebels launched a swift offensive on the Syrian capital, leading to the flight of President Bashar Assad and the end of his family's decades-long rule. The rebels' main focus has been securing the city of Damascus, where looting and attacks on government and security buildings have been limited. On Sunday, a group of rebels arrived in Husseiniyeh, a village where looters, including women and children, had raided a residential complex. They took furniture, food, copper wires, and other valuables. Residents described their homes being ransacked, with some even watching as looters set fires to the buildings and carried off what they could. One resident described the looting of his 25-year home and pointed out a child walking away with a box of metal cables. A local school principal reported that her home was looted but that she was unable to stop it. She criticized the rebels, but a fighter responded by promising to establish a checkpoint in the area to prevent further thefts, as many of the looters came from a nearby village. The looters resorted to firing grenades at the apartments, causing fires, while the rebels fired shots near the looters to disperse them and took action to apprehend some of the culprits. The rebels detained around a dozen looters, while others managed to flee, still carrying their stolen goods. No injuries were reported in the confrontation.The post Syrian Rebel Force Deployed Near Damascus to Stop Looters first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/syrian-rebel-force-deployed-damascus-stop-looters/	2024-12-16T10:44:31-08:00	
Israel to Close Embassy in Ireland Amid Gaza Tensions	Israel has decided to close its embassy in Dublin as tensions between Israel and Ireland have escalated, particularly due to Ireland's stance on the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Israel's Foreign Minister, Gideon Sa'ar, condemned Ireland's policies, describing them as 'extreme anti-Israel.' This move follows a series of diplomatic clashes, such as Ireland's recognition of Palestine as a state alongside countries like Spain and Norway earlier in the year. The situation further deteriorated when the Irish Cabinet decided to join South Africa in its case against Israel at the International Court of Justice, accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. While Israel strongly denies these accusations, Irish Foreign Minister Micheál Martin emphasized that such actions are unacceptable under international law. Despite the embassy closure, Ireland maintains that its policies are rooted in a commitment to human rights and peace, and it remains open to diplomatic dialogue. Prime Minister Simon Harris expressed regret over Israel's decision but firmly rejected the claim that Ireland is 'anti-Israel,' stating that the country stands for international law, peace, and human rights.The post Israel to Close Embassy in Ireland Amid Gaza Tensions first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-close-embassy-ireland-gaza-tensions/	2024-12-16T10:44:22-08:00	
Raad Asserts Syrian People’s Right to Self-Determination	Hezbollah's parliamentary bloc leader, MP Mohammad Raad, emphasized the critical importance of the Syrian people's right to self-determination. Raad pointed out that the regime change in Syria was not a spontaneous event but rather a consequence of a well-coordinated effort by regional and international powers aiming to alter the authority in the country. In his article for al-Akhbar newspaper, Raad acknowledged the significant presence of armed opposition factions in Syria. He underscored that the Syrian people have the legitimate right to decide their political future and stressed that any change should reflect the will of the entire Syrian population, encompassing all its components and formations. Raad also highlighted the essential unity of Syria, cautioning against any actions that might jeopardize it. He emphasized the necessity for political freedom to be aligned with national sovereignty and commitments. Additionally, Raad called on the Lebanese government to fulfill its responsibilities in protecting Lebanon through its institutions, including the Lebanese army and UNIFIL, while affirming that Hezbollah remains a critical defender of Lebanese sovereignty. This stance by Hezbollah underscores the broader regional implications of the Syrian conflict and the ongoing debate over self-determination and national sovereignty within the Middle Eastern geopolitical landscape. The recognition of the Syrian people's right to determine their own future remains a pivotal issue, influencing both regional stability and international relations.The post Raad Asserts Syrian People’s Right to Self-Determination first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/raad-syrian-peoples-right-self-determination/	2024-12-16T10:44:13-08:00	
Assad Denies Plans to Leave Syria, Labels New Leaders as Terroris...	Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has strongly denied any intentions of leaving Syria, labeling the emerging leadership as terrorists. In a recent statement, Assad dismissed rumors about his departure, asserting his commitment to remain in Syria despite the ongoing conflict and international pressure. He condemned the new leaders, branding them as terrorists who pose a threat to Syria’s stability. Assad's regime, which has faced substantial opposition and international criticism, continues to reject the legitimacy of the opposition forces, attributing their rise to foreign intervention and extremist ideologies. Assad’s government, backed by Russian and Iranian support, has been engaged in a protracted conflict with various rebel factions. The situation remains volatile, with Assad emphasizing his determination to fight what he perceives as terrorism to restore order and sovereignty in Syria. This declaration comes amidst growing international isolation and condemnation of Assad’s tactics, including alleged war crimes and humanitarian abuses during the civil war that has ravaged Syria for over a decade. The future of Syria remains uncertain as the conflict continues to evolve with complex regional and international dynamics.The post Assad Denies Plans to Leave Syria, Labels New Leaders as Terrorists first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/assad-denies-plans-leave-syria-leaders-terrorists/	2024-12-16T10:44:06-08:00	
MP Urges State to Protect Lebanon Without Hezbollah’s Help	Weeks after a U.S.-French brokered ceasefire was established, Israel continued to violate the agreement, prompting Hezbollah to accuse it of exploiting a 60-day withdrawal period. Hezbollah also criticized the Lebanese state's efforts to halt these violations as ineffective. According to the ceasefire terms, Israeli forces have 60 days to withdraw from Lebanon, while Hezbollah must relocate its heavy weaponry north of the Litani River. Hezbollah MP Hassan Fadlallah commented on Monday that although there are efforts to stop Israel's violations, they have not been successful. Israel maintains that the ceasefire agreement permits it to use military force against perceived violations. Since the ceasefire began on November 27, Israeli strikes, primarily in southern Lebanon, have resulted in at least 29 deaths and 27 injuries. Despite this, the fragile truce seems to be holding. Fadlallah mentioned that Hezbollah is coordinating with the Lebanese government, urging it to fulfill its responsibilities and protect Lebanon through its institutions, the Lebanese army, the UNIFIL, and the monitoring committee. The U.S.-led committee monitoring the ceasefire includes representatives from France, the U.N. peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon (UNIFIL), Lebanon, and Israel. Fadlallah emphasized that Hezbollah's resistance is crucial for protection but acknowledged that the state now has an opportunity to demonstrate its capability to defend Lebanon without relying on Hezbollah. He challenged the state to prove itself. On Monday, an Israeli raid on a valley near al-Najjariyeh, south of Sidon, injured three people. Since the ceasefire, Israel has conducted at least three airstrikes in the Sidon district, claiming to target Hezbollah rockets and movements.The post MP Urges State to Protect Lebanon Without Hezbollah’s Help first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/mp-state-protect-lebanon-without-hezbollahs-help/	2024-12-16T10:43:56-08:00

US in Contact with New Rulers of Syria	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed on Saturday that American officials have had direct communication with the terrorist-designated rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which played a leading role in the ousting of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Blinken, speaking at a press conference in Jordan, was the first U.S. official to publicly acknowledge these contacts between the Biden administration and HTS, a group that led a coalition of opposition forces responsible for driving Assad from power and forcing him into exile in Russia last weekend. Blinken, alongside counterparts from eight Arab nations, Turkey, and senior officials from the European Union and United Nations, endorsed a set of principles to guide Syria's transition toward a peaceful, inclusive, and nonsectarian country. While Blinken did not provide details of the discussions with HTS, he emphasized the importance of delivering messages to the group about its future conduct and governance during the transitional period. In Aqaba, Blinken stated that the U.S. had been in contact with HTS and other parties, and reassured the Syrian people that the U.S. supports their success and is prepared to help. HTS, which was previously affiliated with al-Qaida, has been designated a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department since 2018, leading to severe sanctions, including a ban on providing material support to the group. However, U.S. officials are not prohibited from communicating with designated groups. In a separate interview on Syrian television, HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, did not comment directly on the contacts with the U.S. but acknowledged that the new authorities in Syria were in communication with Western embassies. He also stated that HTS did not intend to engage in further conflict, citing the exhaustion of Syria's population. HTS has been working to stabilize security and initiate a political transition after seizing control of Damascus. It has attempted to reassure the public, which remains shaken by Assad's fall and concerned about the presence of extremist elements among the rebels. The group's leaders have stated their commitment to distancing themselves from their extremist past. Blinken also highlighted the continued importance of defeating the Islamic State group, noting that U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters, part of the Syrian Democratic Forces, have played a critical role in driving ISIS out of large parts of Syria. He emphasized the need for these forces to maintain their position, especially during this unstable period when ISIS may attempt to regroup. A joint statement from the foreign ministers meeting in Jordan urged all parties to stop hostilities in Syria and voiced support for a locally led political transition. The statement also called for preventing the resurgence of extremist groups and ensuring the secure and safe destruction of Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles. Jordan’s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, expressed concerns about Syria falling into chaos. Additionally, Arab foreign ministers issued a statement calling for U.N.-supervised elections based on a new constitution approved by the Syrian people, while condemning Israel's recent actions in the region. U.S. officials have noted that al-Sharaa has made positive statements about protecting the rights of minorities and women, but they remain skeptical about his long-term commitment to these goals. In other developments, Syrian rebels and the unarmed opposition worked with U.S. officials to facilitate the release of an American man who had been detained by Assad's government. U.S. officials also continue their search for Austin Tice, an American journalist who has been missing near Damascus for 12 years. Blinken stressed the importance of continued efforts to locate Tice and bring him home.The post US in Contact with New Rulers of Syria first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-contact-new-rulers-syria/	2024-12-15T09:04:07-08:00	
Germany Warns Assad Supporters Fleeing Atrocities Won’t Be Welcom...	Germany's foreign minister has issued a strong warning to anyone involved in atrocities under the regime of ousted Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, stating that they will face legal consequences if they attempt to seek refuge in Germany. The country has been a major destination for Syrian refugees over the past decade, with several hundred thousand Syrians currently living there. In recent years, Germany has convicted former Syrian secret police officers for their roles in the abuse of detainees. Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock made it clear that those who were complicit in the Syrian regime's crimes will be held accountable. She emphasized that Germany would take legal action against anyone involved in torturing detainees under Assad's rule, stating that the country would use 'the full force of the law' to ensure justice. Baerbock also called for closer cooperation between international security agencies and intelligence services to prevent perpetrators from fleeing. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser assured that Germany is 'extremely vigilant' in monitoring its borders and has implemented measures to reduce irregular migration. She reiterated that no one involved in atrocities would be safe from prosecution in Germany. Faeser pointed to previous convictions as proof of Germany's commitment to pursuing justice in such cases. While Germany has emphasized its commitment to prosecuting war crimes, it has also reassured well-integrated refugees that they are welcome to stay. Chancellor Olaf Scholz addressed concerns about the return of Syrians to their homeland, acknowledging that many refugees hope to return once conditions allow. However, he stressed that the future of Syria under Assad's absence remains uncertain, and only time will reveal the country's direction.The post Germany Warns Assad Supporters Fleeing Atrocities Won’t Be Welcome first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/germany-assad-supporters-fleeing-wont-be-welcome/	2024-12-15T07:53:15-08:00	
Mikati Urges Syrians to Return Home	Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati has urged Syrians who sought refuge in Lebanon to return home following the fall of President Bashar al-Assad. Mikati highlighted that Lebanon, with a population of 5.8 million, is currently hosting around two million Syrians, with over 800,000 registered with the United Nations. This makes Lebanon the country with the highest number of refugees per capita. At a political event in Rome on Saturday, Mikati explained that the influx of refugees has placed immense strain on Lebanon's already struggling economy, intensifying competition for jobs and services. He noted that one-third of Lebanon’s population now consists of Syrian refugees, further complicating the nation’s economic challenges. Mikati emphasized that the best solution to the refugee crisis, in light of the recent political changes in Syria, is for Syrians to return to their homeland. He also called on the international community, particularly Europe, to assist in this process. He suggested that recovery efforts should be initiated in secure areas of Syria to facilitate the return of refugees.The post Mikati Urges Syrians to Return Home first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/mikati-urges-syrians-return-home/	2024-12-15T07:53:08-08:00	
UN Envoy Urges Sanctions Relief After Assad’s Fall	The United Nations Special Envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, urged for the swift removal of Western sanctions following the removal of President Bashar Assad. For years, the Syrian government has been subjected to strict sanctions from the United States, European Union, and other nations, due to Assad's violent crackdown on what initially began as peaceful protests in 2011, eventually escalating into a brutal civil war. The conflict has resulted in nearly half a million deaths and displaced half of Syria’s pre-war population of 23 million. Efforts to rebuild have been heavily hindered by sanctions, which aimed to block reconstruction in government-controlled regions until a political solution could be reached. During his visit to Damascus, Pedersen expressed hope for an end to the sanctions to allow for the rebuilding of Syria. He met with officials from the interim government formed by the opposition forces, led by the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which played a central role in ousting Assad. Although HTS is recognized as a terrorist organization by the U.S., which may complicate reconstruction efforts, the Biden administration has hinted at the possibility of removing this designation. The interim government, expected to oversee the country until March, has yet to clarify how it plans to transition to a permanent administration. Pedersen emphasized the need for an inclusive political process led by Syrians themselves. He also stressed the importance of justice and accountability for crimes committed during the conflict, and called on the international community to increase humanitarian aid.The post UN Envoy Urges Sanctions Relief After Assad’s Fall first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/un-envoy-urges-sanctions-relief-assads-fall/	2024-12-15T07:53:00-08:00	
One Week Into New Syria: Rebels Seek Normalcy, Syrians Refuse Sil...	At Damascus International Airport, the new head of security, a former rebel who had marched across Syria to the capital, arrived with his team. The few maintenance workers who reported to work gathered around Maj Hamza al-Ahmed, eager to learn about the changes ahead. They quickly shared grievances that had been silenced during President Bashar Assad’s rule, which now, surprisingly, had come to an end. The workers spoke about being denied promotions and benefits in favor of Assad loyalists and being threatened with imprisonment for slow work. They also expressed concerns about hardcore Assad supporters among the airport staff, who might return once the facility reopens. As al-Ahmed tried to reassure them, engineer Osama Najm commented, 'This is the first time we talk.' This was a pivotal week for Syria following Assad’s unexpected downfall. Rebels, now in charge, encountered a population filled with mixed emotions—excitement for newfound freedoms, grief over years of oppression, and uncertainty about the future. Some were so overwhelmed by the changes that they were brought to tears. Surprisingly, the transition has been smooth. There have been few reports of reprisals, sectarian violence, or revenge killings. Looting and destruction were quickly controlled, and insurgent fighters have been disciplined. In the capital, Damascus, life went on as usual, with only a single van of fighters spotted. Yet, there are numerous challenges ahead. Syria is broken, isolated after five decades of Assad rule. Families have been torn apart by war, former prisoners suffer from trauma, and tens of thousands of detainees remain unaccounted for. The economy is in shambles, poverty is widespread, and corruption is rampant. Despite these issues, many are eager to chart a new path forward. At the airport, al-Ahmed told the staff, 'The new path will have challenges, but Syria is for all, and we must cooperate.' Najm, an engineer, acknowledged the rebels' positive rhetoric but warned, 'We will not stay silent about anything wrong again.' Meanwhile, in a police station that had been burned down, Assad’s pictures were torn down, and files destroyed after insurgents entered the city on December 8. All Assad-era police and security personnel had disappeared. By Saturday, the station was being managed by ten men from the police force of the rebels' de facto 'salvation government,' which had previously governed Idlib in Syria's northwest. These rebel policemen, now tasked with overseeing the station, dealt with petty thefts and street disputes. One woman complained about neighbors sabotaging her power supply, and a policeman informed her that courts would soon begin operating again, though it would take time. The rebels have tried to bring order to Damascus by replicating the system they had in Idlib. However, scaling this structure is a challenge. There are only about 4,000 rebel policemen, with half of them stationed in Idlib and the rest tasked with maintaining security in Damascus and other areas. Some experts estimate the total number of insurgents at around 20,000. The fighters and civilians are still learning about each other. Many insurgents drive expensive SUVs and carry Turkish lira, an unofficial currency in government-controlled areas. Most of the fighters come from conservative, rural areas and some are hardline Islamists. The main rebel group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, has distanced itself from its al-Qaeda past, but some fighters still wear Islamist slogans on their uniforms, and not all insurgents belong to HTS. Many Syrians remain wary of the new forces, with some, like Hani Zia from Daraa, concerned about the potential for attacks on minorities and revenge killings. Zia fears that some fighters may feel superior due to their years of fighting. Despite these fears, life in Damascus has not been marked by widespread fear. Many people feel a newfound sense of freedom and refuse to be oppressed any longer. Some restaurants have resumed serving alcohol, while others do so more discreetly. At a café in the Christian quarter of the Old City, men were drinking beer when a fighter patrol passed by, but the fighters did nothing. Salem Hajjo, a theater teacher who had participated in the 2011 protests, expressed that although he disagreed with the rebels' Islamist views, he admired their ability to manage their affairs and expected to have a voice in Syria’s future. 'We have never been this at ease,' he said. 'The fear is gone. The rest is up to us.' In the aftermath of Assad’s fall, celebratory gunfire echoed through the streets. Some security agency buildings were set on fire, and the airport's duty-free was looted. The rebels blamed fleeing Assad loyalists for much of the chaos. The public stayed indoors, watching from a distance as the insurgents imposed order. A three-day curfew was announced, and fighters were deployed to protect properties. After a day, people began to venture out, with many heading to the prisons, particularly Saydnaya, to search for loved ones who had been missing for years. Though few found any trace of the missing, it was a unifying experience. Rebels searching for their own lost relatives mingled with families of the missing, all in the same grim halls. During the street celebrations, insurgents invited children to climb onto their armored vehicles, posed for photos with women, and played revolutionary songs. Posters of activists killed by Assad’s regime began appearing everywhere, and the state-controlled TV stations swiftly switched from praising Assad to airing revolutionary songs and declarations from the new insurgent-led government. The new administration has called on people to return to work and urged Syrian refugees to come back to help rebuild the country. Plans for rehabilitating the security forces have been announced to prevent the return of individuals with blood on their hands. Rebel leaders assured airport staff, many of whom had been loyal to Assad, that their homes would not be attacked. Despite the hopeful atmosphere, Syria still faces many unresolved issues. Although produce prices have fallen after Assad’s departure, fuel distribution has been disrupted, leading to high transportation costs and widespread blackouts. Officials are working to reopen the airport soon. This week, maintenance crews inspected planes on the tarmac, and cleaners began clearing away trash and broken furniture. One cleaner, Murad, shared that he earned the equivalent of $15 a month and had six children to care for, one of whom is disabled. He dreams of owning a mobile phone but knows it will take time to clean up the airport. 'We need a long time to clean this up,' he said.The post One Week Into New Syria: Rebels Seek Normalcy, Syrians Refuse Silence first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/one-week-new-syria-rebels-normalcy-syrians-refuse-silence/	2024-12-15T07:52:52-08:00

Assad’s Fall in Syria Further Weakens Hezbollah	Hezbollah is currently in a weakened state and unable to defend former Syrian President Bashar Assad from the rapid insurgency that removed him from power. With Assad's departure, Hezbollah, a militant group based in Lebanon, finds itself in an even more compromised position. The group suffered significant losses during a 14-month conflict with Israel. The fall of Assad, who had close ties with Iran, has now disrupted Hezbollah's essential weapons supply route through Syria. Hezbollah officials, while concerned, remain defiant. Lebanese lawmaker Hassan Fadlallah, representing Hezbollah's political wing, acknowledged the significant changes in Syria, but assured that these events would not weaken their resolve. Analysts believe this reduction in Hezbollah's power will have major implications for Lebanon, where Hezbollah has been a dominant political force, and for Iran, which has used Hezbollah as a proxy to extend its influence across the Middle East. Israel also benefits from this shift, as Hezbollah, its adversary on the northern border, is now at its weakest in decades. The Assad regime played a critical role in Hezbollah's rise to power, providing a conduit for Iranian weapons and a place for training fighters. In return, Hezbollah supported Assad during the Syrian civil war by sending thousands of fighters to aid his forces. As insurgents captured Homs and advanced towards a Syrian border town with a Hezbollah presence, many expected fierce resistance. However, Hezbollah was disorganized due to the loss of key leaders, including Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, in Israeli airstrikes, and the destruction of much of its military infrastructure. With Russia and Iran not intervening, Hezbollah retreated, and Assad was quickly overthrown. The fall of the Assad regime marks the end of Iran's influence in Syria and Lebanon, according to Lt. Col. Fares al-Bayoush, a Syrian army defector. In Lebanon, the weakening of Hezbollah has allowed the Lebanese army to reassert control, particularly along the southern border. A U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel calls for Hezbollah to have no armed presence along this border, leading to increased demands within Lebanon for the group to disarm. Samir Geagea, leader of the Christian Lebanese Forces Party, urged Hezbollah to transition into a political party and cease its armed activities. The weakening of Hezbollah has also caused friction within Lebanon's political sphere. Many Lebanese are critical of Hezbollah, accusing it of breaking its promise to use its weapons only for Lebanon's defense by launching rockets into Israel last year following a Hamas attack. The war with Israel resulted in significant casualties and displacement in Lebanon, with more than 4,000 people killed, over 1 million displaced, and extensive economic damage. The changing dynamics in Syria mean Hezbollah faces an entirely new reality, according to Firas Maksad of the Middle East Institute. Some former allies of Hezbollah in parliament are now distancing themselves from the group. Jebran Bassil, representing the Free Patriotic Movement, suggested that Hezbollah's loss of an Iranian weapons pipeline could help Lebanon disengage from regional conflicts and focus on internal affairs. With the fall of Assad, Iran has lost control of a strategic land corridor that facilitated the supply of weapons to Hezbollah. Aron Lund of Century International notes that while some smuggling might continue, it will not be on the same scale as before. For Israel, the disruption of Iran's regional network is a significant victory, although it remains cautious of the Islamic militants among the insurgents who toppled Assad. Israel has temporarily moved troops into a demilitarized zone with Syria for security reasons. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described Assad's fall as a historic event, attributing it to Israel's decisive actions against Hezbollah and Iran, Assad's primary supporters.The post Assad’s Fall in Syria Further Weakens Hezbollah first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/assads-fall-syria-weakens-hezbollah/	2024-12-14T04:11:15-08:00	
Ousted Syrian President’s Inner Circle: Where Are They Now?	Following the ousting of Syrian President Bashar Assad earlier this month, many high-ranking officials and members of his feared intelligence and security services have seemingly vanished. According to activists, some have managed to escape the country, while others have gone into hiding in their hometowns. The Assad family had maintained a strict rule over Syria for more than 50 years, imprisoning and often torturing or killing those who challenged their authority. Ahmad al-Sharaa, the leader of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) insurgent group that led the anti-government forces to overthrow Assad, has promised to bring those responsible for such abuses to justice. He stated that they would pursue these individuals within Syria and request foreign nations to extradite any suspects. However, identifying and apprehending these individuals may prove challenging. Recently, around 8,000 Syrians have crossed into Lebanon through the Masnaa border, while approximately 5,000 have left Lebanon via Beirut’s international airport, according to Lebanese security and judicial officials. Most of these are believed to be ordinary citizens, and Lebanon’s Interior Minister Bassam Mawlawi reported that no Syrian officials had entered Lebanon legally. In an effort to prevent Assad’s government members from fleeing, a Lebanese officer associated with Assad’s brother was put on leave. Nonetheless, Rami Abdurrhaman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claims that several senior officers have reached Lebanon using false identities. The following details provide insight into Assad and key officials in his inner circle: Bashar Assad: Initially seen as a potential reformer when he took power in 2000, Assad soon resorted to brutal measures to suppress dissent during the 2011 protests, leading to a full-scale civil war. He has reportedly fled to Moscow. Maher Assad: Bashar Assad’s younger brother, Maher, commanded the 4th Armored Division, known for committing numerous atrocities, including torture and extortion. He is under sanctions by the U.S. and Europe and is believed to have fled to Russia. Maj. Gen. Ali Mamlouk: A former head of intelligence and security adviser to Assad, Mamlouk is wanted in Lebanon for his involvement in a 2012 bombing and has been convicted in France for war crimes. He is thought to have escaped to Lebanon. Brig. Gen. Suheil al-Hassan: Al-Hassan, commander of the 25th Special Missions Forces Division, played a crucial role in many government victories during the civil war. He has close ties to Russia, but his current location is unknown. Maj. Gen. Hussam Luka: Head of the General Security Directorate, Luka played a significant role in suppressing the opposition in Homs. He has been sanctioned by the U.S. and Britain, and his whereabouts are unclear. Maj. Gen. Qahtan Khalil: Known as the 'Butcher of Daraya' for leading a deadly 2012 attack, Khalil was the head of the Air Force Intelligence service. His current location is unknown. Other Officials: Retired Maj. Gen. Jamil Hassan, previously head of the Air Force Intelligence, and involved in the Daraya attack, is among those convicted in France. Defense Minister Lt. Gen. Ali Abbas and Maj. Gen.

US Flies American Freed from Syrian Prison to Jordan	The U.S. military has successfully extracted an American citizen, Travis Timmerman, from Syria, where he had been held in the infamous prison system of former President Bashar Assad. Timmerman, 29, had been missing for seven months before being among the thousands released by rebels earlier this week. Timmerman was transported to Jordan via a U.S. military helicopter, according to U.S. officials. While his next destination remains uncertain, Timmerman has expressed a desire to remain in the region. He had been detained in Syria after crossing the border during a Christian pilgrimage from Zahle, Lebanon, in June. During his imprisonment at the Palestine Branch, a well-known detention facility managed by Syrian intelligence, Timmerman reported not being mistreated. He described his cell as having basic amenities such as a mattress and containers for drinking water and waste. He used the Friday prayer calls to keep track of the days. Timmerman was released on Monday alongside a young Syrian man and 70 women, some of whom were accompanied by their children, following the rebels' seizure of Damascus and the ousting of Assad. He was freed by rebels who broke into his cell with a hammer. He mentioned that he was held separately from other Syrian and Arab detainees and was unaware of any other Americans in the facility. Timmerman hails from Urbana, Missouri, and graduated with a finance degree from Missouri State University in 2017. His mother, Stacey Gardiner, received information that he was being taken to a military base in Jordan, but the family had not yet communicated with him. Mouaz Moustafa, a Syrian opposition activist based in the U.S., played a key role in coordinating Timmerman's transfer to safety. He tweeted a photo of Timmerman with a U.S. military personnel in the desert, confirming his safety. U.S. officials continue to search for Austin Tice, an American journalist who disappeared near Damascus 12 years ago. Nizar Zakka, president of Hostage Aid Worldwide, which is involved in the search for Tice, received a tip about a foreigner believed to be Tice, but this was later ruled out by Tice’s family. Zakka noted that the search for Tice involved visiting detention centers and contacting influential figures within Assad’s circle, but no concrete results have emerged. He outlined three scenarios for Tice's whereabouts: he could be in a Damascus jail, held by a high-ranking Assad loyalist who fled the country, or he might have been killed by his captors to cover up their crimes. Zakka also criticized the U.S. government's offer of a $10 million reward for information on Tice, arguing it has led to many false tips and added confusion.The post US Flies American Freed from Syrian Prison to Jordan first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-flies-american-freed-syrian-prison-jordan/	2024-12-14T04:10:56-08:00	
Syria Urges UN to Demand Israeli Withdrawal	Syria’s interim government has called on the U.N. Security Council to demand Israel cease its attacks on Syrian territory and withdraw from areas it has entered in the north, violating a 1974 Disengagement Agreement. In letters to the council and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Syria’s U.N. Ambassador Koussay Aldahhak made these demands on behalf of the interim government. These letters, dated December 9, come shortly after rebels overthrew President Bashar al-Assad, ending his family's more than five-decade rule. The letters highlight Syria’s transition to a phase of seeking freedom, equality, and rule of law. Despite these aspirations, Israel has expanded its presence in Mount Hermon and Quneitra Governorate. Israel continues to control the Golan Heights, seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. The 1974 Disengagement Agreement established a demilitarized buffer zone between Israel and Syria, monitored by the U.N. peacekeeping force, UNDOF. In a letter to the Security Council also dated December 9, Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon justified Israel's limited and temporary measures, including deploying troops in the separation area to prevent armed threats against Israeli territory. Meanwhile, Turkey’s Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan stated that eliminating the U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish militia, the People’s Protection Units (YPG), remains Turkey’s strategic goal. Fidan called for non-Syrian YPG members to leave Syria and for remaining members to disarm. The YPG is aligned with the U.S. in combating the Islamic State but is viewed by Turkey as a terrorist organization. On Friday, Israeli airstrikes targeted multiple sites across Syria, including Mount Qasioun in Damascus, Khalkhala Airport in Sweida, and Defense and Research Laboratories in Masyaf, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The strikes, part of Israel’s ongoing efforts to neutralize potential threats following Assad’s ouster, also targeted six military sites in Damascus and Sweida earlier that day. Following Assad’s fall, Israel has conducted numerous airstrikes on Syrian military sites, including weapon production facilities and airfields, and has moved troops to occupy a buffer zone in the Golan Heights. Russian military forces have begun withdrawing from southern Syria towards their primary base in Latakia. This movement raises questions about Russia's ability to project power in the Middle East post-Assad. Russian convoys, including tanks and armored personnel carriers, were seen heading north on the Damascus-Homs highway. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that Russian forces were also leaving bases in Ain Issa and Tel Al-Samn in the Al-Raqqah countryside. Satellite images from Maxar Technologies showed cargo planes at a Russian military airfield in Syria being prepared to transport heavy equipment, while helicopters were being dismantled. Earlier in the week, all Russian naval ships departed from the Syrian port of Tartus, according to a U.S. official.The post Syria Urges UN to Demand Israeli Withdrawal first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/syria-urges-un-demand-israeli-withdrawal/	2024-12-14T04:10:50-08:00	
Israeli Strikes Hit Syrian Military Sites, War Monitor Reports	A Syrian war monitor reported that early on Saturday, Israel conducted airstrikes targeting military sites in Damascus and its surrounding areas. These strikes are the latest in a series following the fall of Bashar al-Assad almost a week ago. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, based in Britain, stated that the Israeli airstrikes destroyed a scientific institute and other military facilities in Barzeh, located in northern Damascus. Additionally, a military airport in the outskirts of the capital was also targeted. The Observatory noted that the strikes hit Scud ballistic missile warehouses, launchers in the Qalamoun area, and various rockets, depots, and tunnels under the mountain. The Observatory detailed that multiple rounds of bombardment aimed at military sites of the former regime forces were intended to dismantle the remaining capabilities of the future Syrian army. On Friday, Israel also targeted a missile base atop Mount Qasyun in Damascus, an airport in the southern Sweida province, and defense and research labs in Masyaf, situated in Hama province. Since the fall of Assad, Israel has carried out numerous strikes on Syrian military sites, targeting chemical weapons stores and air defenses. In a controversial move condemned by the international community, Israel seized a United Nations-patrolled buffer zone on the Syrian Golan Heights shortly after rebels, led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, took control of Damascus. On Thursday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres voiced concerns over extensive violations of Syrian sovereignty and the Israeli airstrikes in the country, as conveyed by his spokesperson.The post Israeli Strikes Hit Syrian Military Sites, War Monitor Reports first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strikes-hit-syrian-military-sites/	2024-12-14T04:10:43-08:00	
Lazio vs Inter Prediction: 16/12/2024	Lazio, currently in 5th place in Serie A, is aiming to secure a top-four finish and qualify for the Champions League next season. The team has been in strong form, winning five straight matches against Genoa, Como, Cagliari, Monza, and Bologna, but suffered a setback with a 3-1 loss to promoted Parma. However, they quickly recovered with two impressive victories over Napoli, first in the Italian Cup (3-1) and then in the league (1-0). Inter Milan, the reigning Scudetto champions, are once again considered title contenders. They are currently 3rd in Serie A, just three points behind the leaders, with a game in hand. Inter has remained unbeaten in their last nine league matches, securing seven wins and two draws. Although they suffered a defeat in their opening Champions League match against Bayer Leverkusen (1-0), they are well-positioned to progress to the knockout stage. Lazio will face challenges in this match due to injuries to key players such as defender Romagnoli and midfielder Vecino, as well as the suspension of striker Castellanos, who has scored six goals this season. Castellanos' absence may see Noslin, who scored a hat-trick in the Italian Cup against Napoli, take his place. Lazio’s attack will rely on players like Isaksen, Dia, Zaccagni, and the midfield partnership of Rovella and Guendouzi. Inter, meanwhile, will be without key defenders Pavard and Acerbi, as well as backup goalkeeper Di Gennaro. However, Dutch full-back Dumfries, who was recently ill, is expected to be available for this match. Inter’s captain trio of Dimarco, Barella, and Lautaro Martinez (who has five goals and two assists) should return to the starting lineup. Lautaro will team up with Marcus Thuram (10 goals and 3 assists) to form a potent attacking force, with Inter boasting the second-best attack in Serie A. Prediction Lazio 1 – 1 Inter. Both teams have recently played in matches with fewer than 3.5 goals, indicating a closely contested game.The post Lazio vs Inter Prediction: 16/12/2024 first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lazio-vs-inter-prediction-16-12-2024/	2024-12-13T06:28:19-08:00	
Israel Targets Hezbollah Operatives in Khiam Strike	The Israeli military has stated that a drone strike targeted Hezbollah militants in the southern Lebanese town of Khiam on Thursday, killing one person. The strike was swiftly condemned by Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister, Najib Mikati. The Israeli army claimed the attack was aimed at Hezbollah members posing a threat to Israeli citizens, violating agreements between Israel and Lebanon. The strike occurred less than a day after Israeli forces handed control of Khiam to the Lebanese army in coordination with U.N. peacekeepers, marking the first Israeli withdrawal from a Lebanese town since the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah began two weeks ago. This move was seen as a critical test for the fragile truce. The Lebanese Health Ministry and state media did not provide specifics on the identity of the person killed but confirmed the airstrike. Lebanese troops were deployed in northern Khiam, working with U.N. peacekeepers to oversee the final stages of Israel's withdrawal and secure other areas. Mikati criticized Israel's actions, calling the strike a breach of the ceasefire agreement and urging the mediators, the U.S. and France, to address Israel's aggression. Israel, however, maintains that its military actions are justified under the terms of the ceasefire, which allows for retaliation against violations. Since the ceasefire began, Israeli attacks, primarily in southern Lebanon, have resulted in at least 29 deaths and 27 injuries. Khiam, located just 3 miles from the Israeli border, was a focal point of heavy fighting during the conflict. The Lebanese army is currently clearing debris and reopening roads in the northern part of the town while coordinating with U.N. peacekeepers to ensure the area is free of unexploded ordnance and accessible to civilians.The post Israel Targets Hezbollah Operatives in Khiam Strike first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-targets-hezbollah-operatives-khiam-strike/	2024-12-13T06:00:38-08:00	
Blinken Pushes for Mideast Unity on Peaceful Syria Transition	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is concluding his visit to Turkey with discussions with Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan on Friday. His efforts focus on gaining regional support for a peaceful political transition in Syria. This visit is part of his broader mission to unify Middle Eastern nations, following the recent change in Syria's leadership with President Bashar al-Assad's ousting. During his trip, Blinken met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to align Turkey with international efforts to prevent further destabilization in Syria. The U.S. is concerned that Syria’s instability could worsen tensions across the region and potentially allow the Islamic State (ISIS) to regain control in parts of Syria. The U.S. has supported the Syrian Defense Forces, a Kurdish group, in the fight against ISIS, but Turkey views them as a threat. Blinken emphasized the importance of continuing to combat ISIS while pursuing a Syrian political transition that ensures the protection of women’s and minority rights, as well as the dismantling of chemical weapons. Later in his trip, Blinken will head back to Aqaba, Jordan, to meet with Arab foreign ministers and officials from the European Union, Arab League, and the United Nations. The meetings will focus on supporting a Syrian-led political process aimed at rebuilding the country’s institutions, preserving its unity and security, and ensuring the rights of its citizens.The post Blinken Pushes for Mideast Unity on Peaceful Syria Transition first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/blinken-mideast-unity-peaceful-syria-transition/	2024-12-13T06:00:20-08:00	
Israel Orders Troops to Stay in Syria Buffer Zone Through Winter	Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has instructed the military to prepare for a prolonged presence in the U.N.-supervised buffer zone between Israeli and Syrian forces on the strategically important Golan Heights. Israel took control of this demilitarized area on Sunday, shortly after Syrian rebels ousted President Bashar al-Assad. Since the takeover, the Israeli military has launched extensive air and naval strikes targeting Syrian military assets, including chemical weapons depots and air defense systems, to prevent them from falling into rebel hands. The decision to deploy troops in the buffer zone comes amidst ongoing Israeli operations in southern Lebanon, where they have been engaged with Hezbollah militants, and continuing conflict in Gaza with Palestinian factions. Defense Minister Gallant’s spokesperson explained that the Israeli presence at the summit of Mount Hermon is vital for security, especially given the unstable situation in Syria. Efforts are being made to ensure that troops can endure the challenging winter conditions while maintaining readiness. Israel claims it seized the zone to safeguard its security. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office stated that the collapse of Assad’s regime has created a vacuum along Israel's border, making it essential to secure the buffer zone temporarily until a force that respects the 1974 armistice agreement can be established. Israel’s occupation of the Golan Heights began in 1967, and it formally annexed the territory in 1981, a move recognized only by the United States. The U.N. has strongly condemned Israel’s actions, with Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressing concern over violations of Syrian sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the region. The U.N. also urged Israel to respect the ceasefire and the armistice terms. The U.S., Israel's key military ally, has called for the incursion to be temporary, while analysts suggest that Israel's actions are aimed at securing potentially dangerous weapons that could fall into the hands of jihadist groups amid Syria’s instability.The post Israel Orders Troops to Stay in Syria Buffer Zone Through Winter first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-troops-stay-syria-buffer-zone/	2024-12-13T06:00:06-08:00	
Who Are Lebanon’s Top Presidential Candidates?	Speaker Nabih Berri is reportedly considering two presidential candidates: former ambassador to the Vatican and ex-army intelligence chief Brigadier General George Khoury, along with MP Farid Haykal al-Khazen, according to a report from Kuwait’s al-Anbaa newspaper on Friday. The report also mentioned that Berri has not ruled out the candidacy of Marada Movement leader and former minister Suleiman Franjieh, emphasizing that everyone retains the democratic right to nominate themselves. Berri is also in agreement with Free Patriotic Movement leader Jebran Bassil on potential candidates such as Brigadier General Khoury, General Security Chief Major General Elias Bayssari, and former Minister Ziad Baroud. Bassil is particularly backing Bayssari and Baroud. Additionally, ex-minister Jean-Louis Cardahi has emerged as a possible candidate with support from the Council of Catholic Patriarchs of the Orient and several high-ranking Vatican officials. The opposition bloc, on the other hand, is rallying behind Army Commander General Joseph Aoun, who has strong international backing, particularly from the U.S. Other names circulating within the opposition include former minister Jihad Azour, ex-MP Salah Honein, MP Neemat Frem, and former minister Nassif Hitti. The French have also suggested the inclusion of banker Samir Assaf on the list of potential candidates. Despite the various candidates, the report highlights that Aoun and Khoury are seen as the front-runners, though each faces opposition from different political factions. Baroud and Cardahi are also considered to have good prospects due to their technocratic credentials.The post Who Are Lebanon’s Top Presidential Candidates? first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/who-are-lebanons-top-presidential-candidates/	2024-12-13T05:59:57-08:00	
Will a New President Be Elected on January 9?	In a recent televised interview, Egyptian Ambassador to Lebanon Alaa Moussa described a meeting between the Quint's ambassadors and Lebanon's Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri as one of the most productive discussions. Moussa emphasized that Berri is committed to electing a president who can bring unity and support the enforcement of United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 1701. UNSC Resolution 1701, passed in 2006 after the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, aims to ensure lasting security along the Lebanese-Israeli border. It mandates the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon, with the Lebanese army and the UN peacekeeping force (UNIFIL) taking control south of the Litani River, excluding Hezbollah. However, the resolution’s terms have never been fully implemented. The relevance of Resolution 1701 resurfaced after a U.S.-mediated ceasefire came into effect in late November to end the hostilities that began with Hezbollah's support for Gaza. The ceasefire calls for the implementation of Resolution 1701, with both the U.S. and France overseeing the process. Several countries, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt, have also been involved in efforts to facilitate the election of a president in Lebanon. Berri has reiterated that a parliamentary session on January 9 will take place to elect a new president, despite Lebanon being without a head of state for over two years due to a deadlock between the pro- and anti-Hezbollah factions. The session is expected to provide enough time for the various political groups to reach a consensus. According to the Egyptian ambassador, the ideal president would have broad support from the parliamentary blocs and align with Resolution 1701. Although no candidates currently have the backing of both sides, Moussa stated that the January session would proceed with multiple rounds of voting until a president is chosen.The post Will a New President Be Elected on January 9? first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/new-president-elected-january-9/	2024-12-13T05:59:42-08:00

UN General Assembly Calls for Gaza Ceasefire	The United Nations General Assembly recently passed a resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, amidst the escalating violence that has deeply affected civilians. This resolution highlights the urgent need for international action to protect innocent lives, provide humanitarian aid, and release hostages, while urging all parties to comply with international law. Overwhelming support for the ceasefire came from 153 countries, reflecting the global call for an end to the ongoing violence. The situation in Gaza has escalated to alarming levels, with the humanitarian crisis worsening every day. Millions of Palestinians are facing dire conditions, with over 80% of Gaza's population displaced. The bombardment and blockade imposed by Israel have led to the deaths of more than 18,000 people, and the civilian toll continues to rise. Critics argue that Israel’s actions violate international law, while supporters emphasize Israel’s right to defend itself, albeit under the constraints of international humanitarian law. Despite calls from the UN for a ceasefire, some nations, including the United States, have faced challenges in securing unanimous international support due to political differences. The international community, however, is united in its concern for Gaza’s children, with many calling the ongoing situation a potential 'genocide' and highlighting the severe toll on young lives. This resolution marks a critical moment for global diplomacy and humanitarian intervention, as the world watches closely to see if the ceasefire will hold and bring relief to the suffering population in Gaza.The post UN General Assembly Calls for Gaza Ceasefire first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/un-general-assembly-calls-gaza-ceasefire/	2024-12-12T04:14:09-08:00	
Israel to Stay in Syria Buffer Zone Until Border Security Secured	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has confirmed that Israeli forces will remain in a Syrian buffer zone until a new security force is established on the Syrian side of the border to ensure stability. This action follows the upheaval caused by the ousting of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, which led to the emergence of a power vacuum along the border. In response, Israel's military seized control of additional strategic points near its border, with the aim of preventing jihadi groups from taking advantage of the instability. Netanyahu's office emphasized that Israel would not allow these groups to threaten the security of its communities, particularly in the Golan Heights, a region Israel captured from Syria in 1967 and later annexed. While the international community generally considers the Golan Heights as occupied Syrian territory, Israel maintains its claim over the region. The Israeli military's presence in the buffer zone is described as temporary, with the intention of handing over control once a security force that is committed to the 1974 disengagement agreement can be formed. Until then, Israeli forces will remain in place to maintain order and prevent any further threats.The post Israel to Stay in Syria Buffer Zone Until Border Security Secured first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-stay-syria-buffer-zone-border-secured/	2024-12-12T04:14:00-08:00	
Blinken Kicks Off Syria Crisis Tour with Arrival in Jordan	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Jordan on Thursday to begin a diplomatic mission in the wake of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's removal from power. Blinken's first stop was Aqaba, where he met with King Abdullah II and Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi to discuss the rapidly changing situation in Syria. He is also scheduled to travel to Turkey on Friday for further talks with Turkish officials. While the main focus of these discussions will be Syria, the ongoing conflict in Gaza, which has caused significant destruction since October 2023, will also be addressed. Blinken's visit follows a series of high-level U.S. engagements in the region in response to Assad's ouster. U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan and a senior military commander have already visited the Middle East in recent days. This comes amid ongoing airstrikes by the U.S. and Israel aimed at countering the Islamic State group and securing chemical weapons to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands. During his meetings, Blinken is expected to emphasize the importance of a peaceful transition in Syria that respects the rights of minority groups, facilitates humanitarian aid, and ensures Syria does not become a haven for terrorism or pose a threat to neighboring countries. The U.S. has expressed its willingness to support a new Syrian government that meets these criteria, particularly if it can secure and eliminate chemical weapons stockpiles. Despite the ongoing shifts, U.S. officials clarified that they are not actively reconsidering the terrorist designation of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Syrian rebel group with historical ties to al-Qaida. However, they remain open to dialogue with its members, even as they stress that HTS is still considered a foreign terrorist organization.The post Blinken Kicks Off Syria Crisis Tour with Arrival in Jordan first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/blinken-kicks-syria-crisis-tour-jordan/	2024-12-12T04:13:48-08:00	
Israel Targets Syria’s Latakia and Tartus in Airstrikes	Israel recently carried out airstrikes targeting Syria’s Latakia and Tartus regions, two significant areas close to the Mediterranean coast. These airstrikes have been reported to have destroyed key military installations, including suspected Iranian weapon caches and storage sites. The strikes hit near a Russian naval base in Tartus, further complicating the regional dynamics, as Russia maintains a presence in Syria and is a key ally of the Assad regime. The airstrikes are part of Israel’s ongoing strategy to weaken Iran’s influence in Syria and prevent the transfer of advanced weapons to Hezbollah, Iran's proxy group. Israel has frequently targeted these sites, particularly in regions where Iran is believed to be enhancing its military footprint. The latest attacks also come in the wake of heightened tensions following the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime. These actions underscore Israel’s ongoing concerns about the growing military presence of Iran in Syria, which it views as a direct threat to its national security. While Israel has refrained from officially commenting on the specific targets of these strikes, military sources have indicated that the operations were aimed at preventing the establishment of a permanent Iranian military infrastructure near Israel’s border. This series of strikes also highlights the complexities of the ongoing Syrian conflict and the involvement of various foreign powers, including Russia and Iran, in shaping the future of the region.The post Israel Targets Syria’s Latakia and Tartus in Airstrikes first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-targets-syrias-latakia-tartus-airstrikes/	2024-12-12T04:13:29-08:00	
US Announces First Israeli Withdrawal from Lebanon Under Ceasefir...	On December 12, 2024, a significant development unfolded in southern Lebanon as Israel began withdrawing its forces from the border region of Khiam. This move follows a ceasefire agreement brokered by the United States, which aims to bring an end to the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah that has devastated the region since October 2023. The Israeli withdrawal, confirmed by both Israeli military officials and U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), is part of a larger deal requiring Israeli forces to vacate southern Lebanon by the end of January 2025. This marked the first phase of the withdrawal under the ceasefire arrangement. The Lebanese Army has since deployed units in the town of Khiam, a strategic border area, to ensure security and maintain stability, with the assistance of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati lauded this step, emphasizing it as vital for strengthening Lebanon's military presence in the south and supporting national stability. The deployment of Lebanese forces in the area is expected to continue in phases as the region transitions to a more secure environment. This ceasefire agreement is seen as a crucial first step toward a broader cessation of hostilities. It follows an earlier statement from U.S. General Erik Kurilla, who noted that this shift marks a pivotal moment for long-term peace prospects in the region.The post US Announces First Israeli Withdrawal from Lebanon Under Ceasefire Deal first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-israeli-withdrawal-lebanon-ceasefire-deal/	2024-12-12T04:13:15-08:00

US Will Recognize Syria If It Renounces Terror, Protects Minoriti...	The Biden administration has announced its intention to recognize and support a new Syrian government that disavows terrorism, eliminates chemical weapons, and upholds the rights of minorities and women. Secretary of State Antony Blinken emphasized that the U.S. would collaborate with various groups within Syria and regional allies to ensure a smooth transition from the ousted regime of President Bashar Assad. However, he did not specify which groups would be involved. Blinken reiterated that the future of Syria should be determined by the Syrian people, with other nations encouraged to support a transparent and inclusive process without interference. He assured that the U.S. would recognize and fully back a Syrian government that emerges from this process, offering support to the country’s diverse communities.The post US Will Recognize Syria If It Renounces Terror, Protects Minorities first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-recognize-syria-renounces-terror/	2024-12-11T10:09:11-08:00	
Berri Meets Bassil and Quint Ambassadors to Discuss Presidential ...	Ambassadors from a five-nation group consisting of the U.S., France, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt met with Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri in Ain el-Tineh on Wednesday to discuss the upcoming presidential election. Egyptian Ambassador to Lebanon, Alaa Moussa, announced that the election session set for January 9 will continue with multiple rounds of voting until a president is elected. U.S. Ambassador Lisa Johnson expressed optimism, saying she felt 'positive' about the situation. This session aims to resolve Lebanon's more than two-year-long vacancy of the presidency, which has been left unfilled since Michel Aoun's term ended in October 2022. The country's political divisions, particularly between Hezbollah and its opposition, have prevented the election of a new president, with neither side able to secure the necessary majority. Berri confirmed that the session on January 9 will proceed as planned without delay. He emphasized the certainty of electing a president on that date, telling Asharq al-Awsat that there would be no postponement. After meeting with Free Patriotic Movement leader Jebran Bassil, the latter echoed Berri's confidence, expressing optimism that the election process is progressing well. Bassil stated that Lebanon would, 'God willing,' have a president on January 9.The post Berri Meets Bassil and Quint Ambassadors to Discuss Presidential Issue first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/berri-meets-bassil-quint-ambassadors-presidential-issue/	2024-12-11T10:06:27-08:00	
5 Dead in Drone Strikes as Israel’s Violations Persist in South L...	An Israeli drone strike on Wednesday evening targeted the southern Lebanese town of Bint Jbeil, killing three civilians, according to media reports. Machinegun fire was also reported in the area. Earlier in the day, another Israeli drone strike hit a van traveling between the southern towns of Beit Leef and Sribbine, resulting in the death of Lebanese national Hamza Morshed Baddah, as reported by the National News Agency (NNA). Another drone strike earlier in the day targeted a house between Ainata and Bint Jbeil, killing one person and injuring another. In Naqoura, Israeli forces blew up a home and conducted raids in the Wadi Hassan area between Majdal Zoun and Shihin, involving artillery shelling and machinegun fire. Additionally, a 15-member Israeli force entered a home in Burj al-Moulouk, searching the property, interrogating the residents, and confiscating their phones. The family was also ordered to evacuate and not return. This escalation comes after months of cross-border exchanges, particularly following Hezbollah’s support of Hamas after the latter's October 7 attack on Israel. While a ceasefire took effect on November 27, both Israel and Hezbollah have accused each other of violating the agreement. The ceasefire plan includes the Lebanese army deploying in the south, alongside UN peacekeepers, while Israeli forces gradually withdraw. In a separate development, UN peacekeepers entered Khiam to verify Israel's withdrawal. Additionally, international ambassadors met with Lebanese parliament speaker Nabih Berri to discuss the ongoing political deadlock in Lebanon, which has been without a president for over two years.The post 5 Dead in Drone Strikes as Israel’s Violations Persist in South Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/5-dead-drone-strikes-israels-violations-south-lebanon/	2024-12-11T10:06:17-08:00	
Syria’s New Leaders Pledge Respect for Lebanon’s Sovereignty	Syria's new leadership, following the ousting of Bashar al-Assad, has made a significant commitment to respecting Lebanon's sovereignty. In a recent statement, the new interim government emphasized its desire to foster peaceful and cooperative relations with neighboring countries, especially Lebanon, and affirmed its respect for Lebanon's territorial integrity. This pledge is crucial, as both countries have been historically entangled in complex political and military relationships. The new Syrian government, led by former rebel factions, has been working to rebuild the country after over a decade of civil war. The leaders have sought to reassure Lebanon that Syria is committed to maintaining peace and stability in the region, which is crucial for Lebanon's own security and recovery. The tension between these neighboring countries, exacerbated by the Syrian conflict, had often led to border issues, with Syria's internal struggles spilling over into Lebanon. This diplomatic shift comes at a time when Syria is attempting to strengthen its international standing and normalize relationships with other regional players, including Lebanon. The new leadership is also under pressure to prove its commitment to a political and economic recovery, not only within Syria but also in its foreign relations, particularly with Lebanon. This commitment to Lebanon's sovereignty is seen as a positive step by international observers, although it remains to be seen how it will impact the broader geopolitical landscape, especially concerning Syria's relations with other regional powers.The post Syria’s New Leaders Pledge Respect for Lebanon’s Sovereignty first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/syrias-new-leaders-respect-lebanons-sovereignty/	2024-12-11T10:06:05-08:00	
France Demands Israel Pull Back from Syria Buffer Zone	France has officially called on Israel to withdraw its forces from the buffer zone established in Syria, emphasizing the need to respect international borders and uphold Syria's sovereignty. The French government expressed deep concerns about the potential escalation of hostilities in an already unstable region. The buffer zone, which Israel has maintained to prevent arms smuggling to hostile groups, has been a point of contention. French Foreign Minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, stated that continued Israeli presence in the buffer zone undermines efforts towards a peaceful resolution in Syria. He urged for a diplomatic approach to address security concerns without infringing on Syria's territorial integrity. This move is part of broader international efforts to stabilize the Middle East, which has seen a decade-long civil war in Syria with devastating consequences. Israel, however, argues that its military presence in the buffer zone is crucial for its national security. Israeli officials cite the need to prevent the transfer of advanced weaponry to Hezbollah and other groups that pose a direct threat to Israel. They also stress that their actions are defensive measures aimed at curbing Iranian influence in Syria. The international community, including the United Nations, is closely monitoring the situation. UN Secretary-General António Guterres has called for restraint from all parties involved and has urged for dialogue to resolve the issue peacefully. The French demand highlights the delicate balance of maintaining security while respecting sovereign borders in the Middle East. As tensions simmer, the world watches to see if diplomatic efforts can prevent further conflict and bring stability to a region plagued by years of war and unrest. The situation remains fluid, with potential repercussions for broader geopolitical dynamics in the Middle East.The post France Demands Israel Pull Back from Syria Buffer Zone first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/france-israel-pull-back-syria-buffer-zone/	2024-12-11T10:05:55-08:00

Lebanese Freed After 33 Years in Syrian Prisons	A Lebanese man who had spent 33 years in Syrian prisons arrived in his hometown of Chekka on Monday, following his release by Islamist-led rebels. Salim Hamawi became the first Lebanese prisoner to return to Lebanon, although another man, Ali al-Ali, was filmed after being freed from a prison in Hama last week. Ali had been missing for almost 40 years during Lebanon’s civil war. His family had no contact with him, and a Syrian journalist in Hama reported that Ali had lost all memory and could not recognize his own identity. Hamawi, speaking upon his return to Lebanon, explained that he had been arrested for his affiliation with the Christian Lebanese Forces party. He shared that he had lost all hope of ever returning home. Following the release of Ali al-Ali’s video online on Thursday, many Lebanese families began calling for answers about the fate of their relatives who are believed to be detained in Syrian prisons. During Lebanon’s 15-year civil war, approximately 17,000 people went missing, many of whom were either imprisoned or killed in detention centers run by Syrian forces in Lebanon and Syria. The whereabouts of many of these individuals remain uncertain.The post Lebanese Freed After 33 Years in Syrian Prisons first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lebanese-freed-33-years-syrian-prisons/	2024-12-10T01:00:15-08:00	
Watch: Meet Abu Mohammed al-Jolani: The New Face of Post-Assad Sy...	Analysis of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham Leader and His Role in Toppling Assad The recent ousting of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has led to a critical inquiry: who now represents the Syrian populace after decades of oppressive rule? A notable contender for this role is Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), spearheaded by Abu Mohammad al-Jolani. This group played a crucial part in the opposition’s efforts that culminated in Assad’s downfall. Origins and Evolution of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham Hayat Tahrir al-Sham emerged in the early days of the Syrian civil war, which began in 2011 as a widespread uprising against Assad’s authoritarian regime. Initially, HTS was an offshoot of the Nusra Front, the official al-Qaida affiliate in Syria. The group was known for its military prowess and commitment to global jihad, with the aim of establishing strict Islamic rule across the Muslim world. In 2016, the Nusra Front publicly cut ties with al-Qaida and rebranded itself as Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, meaning 'Front for the Conquest of the Levant.' The following year, it merged with several other factions to form Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or the 'Organization for the Liberation of the Levant.' This rebranding was an effort to distance itself from al-Qaida’s global jihadist agenda and to focus more on issues specific to Syrians, such as local governance, economic concerns, and humanitarian aid. Despite these changes, HTS’s core ideology remains rooted in jihadism, with the primary goal of overthrowing the Assad regime and establishing Islamic rule in Syria. Abu Mohammad al-Jolani: A Key Figure Born Ahmed al-Sharaa in 1982 in Saudi Arabia, al-Jolani relocated to Damascus with his family in 1989. His jihadist career began in Iraq following the 2003 US-led invasion, where he joined forces aligned with al-Qaida. In 2011, under the direction of then-al-Qaida in Iraq leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, al-Jolani was tasked with establishing the Nusra Front in Syria, which quickly became a significant force in the civil war. Under al-Jolani’s leadership, HTS has sought to present itself as more pragmatic, focusing on governance issues in Idlib, Syria’s largest rebel stronghold. This shift has been part of al-Jolani’s effort to transition from a jihadist leader to a more politically viable figure in Syrian politics. Al-Jolani’s pragmatic approach since 2017 has been crucial in helping HTS control territories and assert itself as a regional governing force. His recent actions, such as adopting a moderate persona and engaging in public services, reflect his central role in HTS’s military and political evolution, reinforcing the group’s hold on power and efforts to gain legitimacy both locally and internationally. HTS’s Rise to Power in Syria HTS has maintained control over its territories by implementing governance systems that provide stability and services, legitimizing its rule in the eyes of local populations. The group aimed to expand its influence and win international acceptance by minimizing opposition and collaborating with the broader Syrian revolutionary movement. This involved working with other actors in Syria to present a united front appealing to international observers and potential allies. Since 2017, HTS has dominated Idlib, the last major stronghold for various rebel groups after government forces retook Aleppo in December 2016. Over the years, HTS has solidified its control by functioning as a quasi-governmental entity, offering civil services and overseeing local affairs, such as highway control and commercial trucking duties, despite reports of human rights abuses. HTS’s propaganda has increasingly emphasized protecting Syrian territory and its people from Assad’s government, enhancing its standing among local communities and other rebel groups. To further improve its image, HTS has ramped up public relations efforts, both domestically and internationally. This includes engaging with international media and humanitarian organizations to negotiate and document aid deliveries, helping to position HTS as a defender of Sunni Muslim interests.

Israel Hits Former Syrian Army Sites in New Strikes	Israel carried out strikes on Monday targeting positions held by the ousted Syrian government's army in various locations, including Damascus, the south, and the coast, according to a war monitor. These strikes are part of a series of attacks that have occurred since rebels took control the day before. Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported that the Israeli strikes targeted military sites, including weapons depots containing anti-tank missiles and anti-aircraft weapons. He added that Israel is intentionally destroying anything it considers a threat. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar stated on Monday that Israel has attacked strategic weapons systems, including chemical weapons, long-range missiles, and rockets, to prevent them from falling into the hands of extremists.The post Israel Hits Former Syrian Army Sites in New Strikes first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-hits-former-syrian-army-sites-new-strikes/	2024-12-10T00:59:50-08:00	
Assad Fleeing to Moscow After Damascus Falls	After a surprise rebel advance in Syria, Bashar al-Assad fled to Moscow, receiving asylum from Russia, his long-time ally. The rebels’ rapid success in capturing Damascus marked the end of Assad's 50-year regime, which had been characterized by heavy control and repression. Thousands of Syrians celebrated in the streets, waving flags and firing guns, recalling the early days of the Arab Spring. The U.S. expressed support for the rebels, with President Biden noting that the shift in power had changed the Middle East balance. However, the situation remains uncertain, as the future of Syria and its region is still unclear. In the midst of these developments, Russia called for a U.N. Security Council meeting to discuss the unfolding events. Assad’s departure followed negotiations with rebel groups, where it was agreed that power would be peacefully transferred. The rebel leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani, who commands Syria's largest insurgent group, has positioned himself as a key figure in the country's future. Despite past ties to al-Qaida, he has distanced himself from the group and advocates for a pluralistic Syria. The rebellion faces immense challenges, as the country remains divided, with Turkey-backed forces clashing with Kurdish groups and remnants of ISIS still active. Rebels have promised to respect all ethnic and religious groups, but concerns over possible reprisals remain. In Damascus, celebrations erupted, with people chanting anti-Assad slogans and looting government buildings. Internationally, Iran and Russia have distanced themselves from Assad as their support has waned. Iran has called for a peaceful resolution and a transition to a new government, with U.N. officials calling for an orderly political transition. Meanwhile, Israel has seized a buffer zone in the Golan Heights, citing security concerns as Syria’s military withdrew from positions there. The situation is fluid, with many countries, including Qatar and the U.N., seeking ways to ensure stability and a peaceful future for Syria amidst the chaos.The post Assad Fleeing to Moscow After Damascus Falls first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/assad-moscow-damascus-falls/	2024-12-09T06:14:48-08:00	
Israeli Strike in Bint Jbeil Kills 1, Injures 4 Troops	The Lebanese Army reported that one person was killed and four soldiers injured on Monday in an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon, where a fragile ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel has been in place since last month. According to the Army, Israeli forces targeted a car near the Saf al-Hawa/Bint Jbeil military checkpoint, resulting in the death of a civilian and light injuries to four soldiers. The National News Agency confirmed that enemy aircraft struck the vehicle on the Saf al-Hawa road near an army checkpoint. The Israeli military stated that on Sunday, it attacked Hezbollah militants at a weapons storage facility in southern Lebanon, accusing them of violating the ceasefire. The military claimed these militants had orchestrated and carried out attacks against Israeli forces and civilians in recent months, and that several Hezbollah fighters had been targeted in the past 24 hours. Israel had intensified its operations in southern Lebanon in late September, following a year of border skirmishes initiated by Hezbollah in support of Hamas after the Palestinian group's attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023. A ceasefire agreement took effect on November 27, and while it has mostly held, both sides have accused each other of violating the truce. As part of the ceasefire agreement, the Lebanese Army and UN peacekeepers are expected to take over security in southern Lebanon while Israeli forces withdraw over 60 days. Hezbollah is also supposed to move its forces north of the Litani River, approximately 30 kilometers from the border, and dismantle its military infrastructure in southern Lebanon. Israel has issued repeated warnings to Lebanese civilians, advising them to avoid border areas, with another warning issued on Monday. The previous Monday, Israeli airstrikes in southern Lebanon resulted in 11 deaths, according to Lebanon’s health ministry, following Hezbollah’s claim of its first attack on an Israeli position since the ceasefire began. The same day, a Lebanese soldier was injured in an Israeli strike in the eastern Hermel region. Lebanese Health Minister Firas Abiad reported on Wednesday that the death toll from the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah had reached 4,047, with most casualties occurring since the escalation in September, including 316 children. On Tuesday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz warned that if the war resumes, Israel would act with greater force and penetrate deeper into Lebanon, stating that no immunity would be granted to the Lebanese state, which has not been directly involved in the conflict.The post Israeli Strike in Bint Jbeil Kills 1, Injures 4 Troops first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strike-bint-jbeil-kills-1-injures-4-troops/	2024-12-09T06:14:34-08:00	
Syria PM: Government Stands Amid Growing Challenges	Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali, who remained in office following the sudden disappearance of President Bashar al-Assad and many senior officials, is working to guide Syria through a transitional phase. He emphasized efforts to ensure the transition is swift and smooth, noting improvements in security and the formation of a new government. Jalali also confirmed that his administration is in communication with rebel factions and expressed his willingness to meet with opposition leaders, such as Ahmad al-Sharaa, a prominent rebel figure. Syria’s transition has seen bureaucrats and officials previously loyal to the Assad regime quickly adapting to the new political climate. For instance, Judge Khitam Haddad from the Justice Ministry expressed readiness to return to work, aiming to contribute to the rebuilding of the country. Haddad emphasized the importance of justice and fairness in the new Syria. In the midst of this upheaval, there have been reports of a high-ranking Assad ally’s death. Major General Ali Mahmoud, a senior aide to Assad’s brother, Maher, was found dead in his office in Damascus. The exact cause of death remains unclear, with some speculating it may have been either a suicide or a targeted killing. The situation in Syria remains fluid, with many key figures of the Assad regime now either absent or facing significant challenges. Jalali’s comments reflect the precarious nature of the country’s future as the nation grapples with a new order following years of brutal civil war.The post Syria PM: Government Stands Amid Growing Challenges first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/syria-pm-government-stands-growing-challenges/	2024-12-09T06:14:23-08:00	
Israel Calls Syria Buffer Zone Takeover a ‘Temporary Step’	Israel recently deployed forces into the demilitarized buffer zone along its northern border with Syria, following significant shifts in the region. As Syrian rebels, including the group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, made rapid advances and seized areas from President Bashar al-Assad's regime, Israel's military intervened to secure the buffer zone near the Golan Heights. The Israeli military emphasized that this was a temporary measure to protect Israeli citizens and prevent armed groups from crossing into Israeli-controlled territories. Despite this action, Israel clarified that it is not involved in Syria's internal conflict.The post Israel Calls Syria Buffer Zone Takeover a ‘Temporary Step’ first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-calls-syria-buffer-zone-takeover-temporary-step/	2024-12-09T06:14:10-08:00	
Four Israeli Soldiers Killed in South Lebanon Tunnel Collapse	On December 9, 2024, four Israeli soldiers were tragically killed in a collapse while engaging in military operations in southern Lebanon. The soldiers, who were reservists, were involved in a conflict with Hezbollah militants in the region. The incident occurred amidst ongoing tensions and military actions between Israel and Hezbollah forces, who are active in southern Lebanon and have been involved in numerous skirmishes since the outbreak of the latest hostilities. The collapse reportedly took place within a tunnel system that Israeli forces were targeting during their mission to dismantle Hezbollah's infrastructure. The soldiers were among several IDF personnel participating in the operation, which aimed to counter Hezbollah's activities along Israel's northern border. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed the deaths, which have raised concerns about the escalating conflict in southern Lebanon. This tragic event highlights the dangers faced by soldiers engaged in complex operations in hostile territories, particularly in regions with entrenched military infrastructure like tunnels used by Hezbollah. The death of these soldiers further intensifies the already volatile situation along the Israel-Lebanon border. Both Israel and Hezbollah have been preparing for additional clashes, especially as the political and military dynamics in the broader region continue to evolve. The incident serves as a grim reminder of the risks involved in the ongoing conflict and the challenges that the IDF faces in attempting to neutralize threats from Hezbollah, who maintain a significant presence in southern Lebanon. This loss underscores the perilous nature of military engagements in areas with heavy fortifications and tunnel networks. As investigations continue, both local and international communities will be closely monitoring the impact of this tragedy on the broader geopolitical situation.The post Four Israeli Soldiers Killed in South Lebanon Tunnel Collapse first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/four-israeli-soldiers-killed-south-lebanon-tunnel-collapse/	2024-12-09T06:13:57-08:00	
Geagea Rejects Hezbollah Arms, Threatens Political Overhaul	Samir Geagea, leader of the Lebanese Forces, expressed his congratulations to the Lebanese people following the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria. He emphasized that for the past five decades, the Assad family rule had been the primary obstacle to establishing a stable state in Lebanon. Geagea noted that no matter what comes next in Syria, it would not be worse than the current regime under Bashar al-Assad. In a recent interview, Geagea stressed that Lebanon's government must take immediate action to fulfill its commitments, including implementing the ceasefire agreement that was reached on November 27, 2024. He also called for the parliament to carry out its duties effectively. Regarding the potential threat from Syrian rebel groups, Geagea asserted that Lebanon's state institutions must act to protect the country, asserting that the Lebanese Army is more than capable of defending its borders against any such threats. He dismissed the idea of Syrian groups launching an attack on Lebanon, pointing out that no such intention had been expressed. When asked whom he would reach out to in light of Assad's fall, Geagea mentioned Hezbollah’s deputy leader, Sheikh Naim Qassem. He suggested that the time had come for all Lebanese factions to prioritize the establishment of a functional state. Geagea stressed that Lebanon must not revert to its previous conditions and urged Hezbollah to disarm and work toward building a proper state. Geagea made it clear that if Hezbollah refused to cooperate, the government must enforce the ceasefire agreement. He warned that failure to do so would lead to a reevaluation of the situation, as the current state of affairs is unsustainable. The LF leader emphasized that Lebanon cannot continue to function as it has, with people leaving the country due to a party’s refusal to relinquish its weapons.The post Geagea Rejects Hezbollah Arms, Threatens Political Overhaul first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/geagea-rejects-hezbollah-arms-threatens-political-overhaul/	2024-12-09T06:13:44-08:00
