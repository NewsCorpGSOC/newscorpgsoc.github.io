Nations League: Germany Near QFs with Win Over Bosnia, 10-Man Dut...	Deniz Undav netted twice as Germany secured a 2-1 victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina on Friday, moving closer to the Nations League quarter-finals, while the Netherlands salvaged a 1-1 draw in Hungary despite being down to 10 men. Germany took the lead in Zenica when Bayer Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz provided a clever backheel assist for Undav to score after 30 minutes. Undav doubled the advantage by converting a cross from Maximilian Mittlestaedt. Bosnia pulled one back with 20 minutes to go, as 38-year-old Edin Dzeko headed in from a corner, marking his 67th international goal. 'After they scored, things got tense, but we stayed in control,' said Undav, making only his second start for Germany, in an interview with RTL. The win puts Germany on seven points from three matches, two ahead of the Netherlands. The two powerhouses will clash on Monday in Munich. 'We should have scored more, given the chances we created,' said Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann. Meanwhile, at the Puskas Arena in Budapest, a minute's silence was observed in honor of Dutch football legend Johan Neeskens, who passed away at age 73. Hungary took the lead in the 32nd minute when Roland Sallai finished from close range after a pass from Zsolt Nagy, marking a great start for coach Marco Rossi in his 69th match in charge of Hungary. The hosts looked set for a win, especially after Liverpool’s Virgil van Dijk was sent off in the 79th minute. However, just four minutes later, Denzel Dumfries headed in a free-kick from Cody Gakpo to level the score. 'Even with ten men, we pushed forward,' said Netherlands coach Ronald Koeman. 'I had a feeling we would score.' Elsewhere, Wales threw away a 2-0 halftime lead to draw 2-2 with Iceland in Reykjavik. Tottenham’s Brennan Johnson, scoring in his seventh straight game, and Harry Wilson put Wales in control, but substitute Logi Tomasson struck twice in the second half, with his second goal coming after a blunder by Wales goalkeeper Danny Ward. 'I'm genuinely happy with this performance, despite the result,' said Wales coach Craig Bellamy. 'We showed a lot of positives.' In the same group, Turkey claimed a 1-0 win over Montenegro. Meanwhile, Sweden saw a 2-0 lead slip away in a 2-2 draw with Slovakia in Bratislava, leaving both teams with seven points from three games, though Sweden leads on goal difference. Yasin Ayari and Ken Sema gave Sweden an early 2-0 advantage, but David Strelec's brace helped Slovakia fight back for a point. In other results, Tomas Chory scored twice as the Czech Republic secured a 2-0 home win over Albania. The Czechs are now level on six points with Georgia, who lost 1-0 to Ukraine after Mykhailo Mudryk’s decisive goal in the 35th minute.The post Nations League: Germany Near QFs with Win Over Bosnia, 10-Man Dutch Hold Hungary first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/germany-near-qfs-win-bosnia-dutch-hold-hungary/	2024-10-12T06:39:53-07:00	
Watch: Trump Vows to Hit India with ‘Reciprocal Tariffs’ if Re-El...	In a speech on Thursday, former US President Donald Trump pledged to implement a 'reciprocal tax' if re-elected, criticizing India for imposing the highest tariffs among major countries. Speaking in Detroit, Trump emphasized the need for reciprocity in trade, highlighting that the US does not generally charge significant tariffs, while countries like China, Brazil, and especially India, impose high tariffs on American products. 'India is a major tariff charger,' Trump said. He acknowledged the strong relationship he had with India and praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a 'great leader' who has united the country. However, Trump pointed out that India, despite its friendly approach, charges very high tariffs on foreign goods, often higher than those imposed by China. He recounted an experience during his presidency when Harley-Davidson executives visited the White House, explaining the challenges they faced in India due to the high tariffs—around 150%. Trump noted that while India encouraged Harley-Davidson to set up manufacturing within the country to avoid these charges, he expressed displeasure with the situation. He explained that such practices push companies to move operations abroad, resulting in the closure of facilities in the US. Trump referred to Modi as 'the nicest human being' and a 'friend,' but also described him as a strong, determined leader. He fondly recalled Modi's visit to Houston in 2019 for the 'Howdy Modi' event, where 80,000 people welcomed them enthusiastically. Trump also shared an anecdote about a time when someone threatened India, and he offered to assist. Modi, however, confidently declined, stating that India had dealt with such threats for centuries. Trump expressed admiration for Modi's strength and leadership, reiterating the close relationship they shared.The post Watch: Trump Vows to Hit India with ‘Reciprocal Tariffs’ if Re-Elected first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/trump-hit-india-reciprocal-tariffs-re-elected/	2024-10-12T06:38:56-07:00	
Lebanon Displacement ‘Devastating’, UN Official Warns of Insuffic...	The displacement of hundreds of thousands of people in Lebanon due to intensified Israeli bombing has been described as 'devastating' by a U.N. migration official, who also emphasized that international support is falling short of the urgent needs on the ground. After a year of intermittent cross-border fire between Israel and Hezbollah, the conflict escalated last month when Israel intensified attacks on Hezbollah positions in southern and eastern Lebanon, as well as areas in southern Beirut. These strikes came after Hezbollah launched attacks on Israel in support of its ally, Hamas, which is engaged in conflict with Israel in Gaza. According to Lebanese authorities, the violence has killed hundreds and displaced over a million people, most of them since September 23. Othman Belbeisi, the Middle East and North Africa director for the International Organization for Migration (IOM), expressed concern over the scale of the displacement and the lack of sufficient aid. 'Lebanon needs more support. What has been offered so far is minimal and does not match the needs,' he told AFP during a visit to Beirut. The IOM has verified and tracked around 690,000 internally displaced people in Lebanon, with an additional 400,000 reportedly fleeing to neighboring countries, primarily Syria. Approximately 185,000 of the displaced are housed in official shelters, such as schools, while others are renting accommodation or staying with relatives. A large number are living in informal or 'host settings,' and some have no shelter at all. The situation is dire for many of those affected, with people fleeing their homes 'with nothing, out of fear,' said Belbeisi. Many now face the daunting task of rebuilding their lives, as Israeli air strikes continue in certain areas, including southern Beirut. To address the worsening humanitarian crisis, the United Nations has launched an appeal for $426 million to assist Lebanon over the next three months, including $32 million specifically for IOM efforts to support around 400,000 displaced people. However, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported on Friday that only 12 percent of the appeal has been funded, with just $51 million received so far. Lebanon has already been grappling with a severe economic crisis for the past five years, which has crippled government services and pushed many into poverty. Belbeisi emphasized the urgency of scaling up international support, saying, 'We want this displacement to end as soon as possible.' The current wave of violence between Hezbollah and Israel began in October 2023, when Hezbollah launched cross-border attacks following the outbreak of war between Hamas and Israel. Since then, the conflict has claimed more than 2,100 lives in Lebanon, with over half of the deaths occurring in the past few weeks, according to government statistics.The post Lebanon Displacement ‘Devastating’, UN Official Warns of Insufficient Support first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lebanon-devastating-un-insufficient-support/	2024-10-12T05:56:37-07:00	
Ireland Accuses Israel of Growing Hostility Toward UN Troops	Ireland’s Foreign Minister Micheal Martin on Friday condemned an Israeli military attack in southern Lebanon that left two United Nations peacekeepers injured. On Thursday, the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, UNIFIL, reported that Israeli forces had fired on their headquarters in the region, wounding two of the peacekeepers. Prime Minister Simon Harris expressed his deep concern about the incident, while Martin, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, described it as 'an extraordinary and shocking development.' 'This represents a significant escalation of hostility by the IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) against U.N. forces and posts. It is absolutely unacceptable. The actions over the past 48 hours have been reckless and intimidating,' Martin said. Ireland contributes 347 troops to the 10,000-strong UNIFIL mission, which is responsible for maintaining peace in southern Lebanon. Speaking to reporters in southwest Ireland, Martin called for the international community to take a stand and 'send a clear message to Israel that this behavior is unacceptable.' He emphasized the need for collective action, urging the global community to engage with Israel to halt such activities and ensure the safety of U.N. peacekeepers. UNIFIL had earlier expressed concern about Israeli troops operating near an outpost manned by Irish soldiers, adding to the growing unease over the situation.The post Ireland Accuses Israel of Growing Hostility Toward UN Troops first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/ireland-accuses-israel-hostility-un-troops/	2024-10-12T05:55:51-07:00	
New Israeli Attack Injures UN Peacekeepers in South Lebanon	On Friday, Lebanon condemned an Israeli attack that reportedly injured United Nations peacekeepers in the country's south, marking the second such incident in two days, according to state media. In an official statement, Lebanon's foreign ministry denounced 'the targeting by the Israeli army' of the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). The statement said the attack hit 'watchtowers, the main UNIFIL base in Ras Naqoura, and the Sri Lankan battalion’s base, causing several injuries.' The National News Agency reported that an Israeli 'Merkava tank' fired at one of UNIFIL’s observation towers on the road between Tyre and Naqoura, wounding personnel from the Sri Lankan battalion. The report added that Israeli forces also 'fired an artillery shell at the entrance of the UNIFIL command center in Naqoura, damaging the entrance.' Later in the day, UNIFIL confirmed that its Naqoura headquarters had been 'affected by explosions for the second time in 48 hours.' The statement revealed that two peacekeepers were injured when explosions occurred near an observation tower. One was taken to a hospital in Tyre, while the other was treated on-site in Naqoura. UNIFIL also reported an incident where several T-walls at their position in Labbouneh collapsed after an Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) caterpillar hit the perimeter, with IDF tanks moving close to the U.N. position. Despite the incident, UNIFIL peacekeepers remained at the location, and a Quick Reaction Force was sent to assist. UNIFIL emphasized that these incidents put peacekeepers serving under U.N. Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) at serious risk, warning that any deliberate attack on peacekeepers constitutes a grave violation of international humanitarian law. The force reiterated that the safety and security of U.N. personnel must be upheld and that U.N. premises should always be respected. On Thursday, two UNIFIL peacekeepers were injured in an earlier Israeli attack on their headquarters. Israel acknowledged that its forces opened fire in the area, claiming Hezbollah militants were operating near U.N. posts. UNIFIL, which has about 10,000 peacekeepers in southern Lebanon, has been calling for a ceasefire since September 23, following nearly a year of cross-border conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. The injured peacekeepers from Thursday’s attack, both from Indonesia, are still receiving treatment, though their injuries were not life-threatening.The post New Israeli Attack Injures UN Peacekeepers in South Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/new-israeli-attack-injures-un-peacekeepers/	2024-10-12T05:55:27-07:00	
France Summons Israeli Envoy Over Attack on UNIFIL Peacekeepers	France announced on Friday that it had summoned the Israeli ambassador in response to reports from U.N. peacekeepers in Lebanon that Israeli fire had struck their headquarters, injuring two staff members. 'These attacks represent significant breaches of international law and must come to an immediate halt,' stated the French foreign ministry. 'Israeli authorities need to provide an explanation for their actions.' As a result, the French government has called in the Israeli ambassador to discuss the matter further.The post France Summons Israeli Envoy Over Attack on UNIFIL Peacekeepers first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/france-summons-israeli-envoy-attack-unifil/	2024-10-12T05:54:23-07:00	
Hochstein: Working ‘Non-Stop’ to Secure Lebanon Ceasefire	The U.S. special envoy to Lebanon, Amos Hochstein, expressed that the United States is working tirelessly towards achieving a ceasefire in Lebanon. Speaking to local media, Hochstein emphasized, 'We want the entire conflict to come to an end,' in an interview with the Lebanese TV channel LBCI from Washington, adding, 'We are working on this non-stop.' Israel has intensified its strikes, targeting what it claims are Hezbollah positions, since September 23. This escalation, following nearly a year of cross-border fire, has led to the deaths of more than 1,200 people and displaced around a million from their homes. Reflecting on the situation, Hochstein condemned reports of Israeli strikes on U.N. peacekeeping posts in southern Lebanon on Friday, calling them 'unacceptable.' He also offered his condolences to the families of two Lebanese soldiers who were reportedly killed by Israeli airstrikes in the country's south on the same day. Israeli attacks have hit various areas across Lebanon, including the south, the east, and Beirut’s southern suburbs. There have also been three deadly airstrikes on central Beirut. Hochstein specifically condemned Thursday's strikes in the Beirut districts of Basta and Nweiri, which killed 22 people, calling them 'totally unacceptable.' 'We're facing an ongoing bombing campaign in Beirut, and it has to stop,' Hochstein stated. 'We’re actively working to put an end to these bombings, especially in densely populated areas of Beirut.' Earlier that same day, Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister, Najib Mikati, called on the United Nations to issue a resolution demanding an 'immediate' ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah.The post Hochstein: Working ‘Non-Stop’ to Secure Lebanon Ceasefire first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/working-non-stop-secure-lebanon-ceasefire/	2024-10-12T05:53:51-07:00	
Sikh Charity Tackles Poverty with Free Meals Initiative	A Sikh charity is providing free meals to those in need as part of its efforts to combat food poverty. Soul Aid, founded by Deepak Singh in 2017, partners with Ramjinder Maan Palvinder Singh, the owner and chef of Kulcha Express in Ilford, to deliver hundreds of free meal boxes throughout Essex. Additionally, they serve meals every Friday at a food collection point on Connaught Road, Ilford. With the help of over 100 volunteers, Mr. Singh ensures the weekly meal service is open to everyone, with no limit on the number of people who can attend. The charity was created to raise awareness about food poverty and assist those in need, regardless of their race or religion. Mr. Singh explained that the rising demand for high protein food assistance was evident, which inspired him to establish Soul Aid. Although Mr. Singh had been helping people for over two decades, he formalized his efforts through the charity. Soul Aid provides free meals, mainly traditional Punjabi cuisine, donated by Kulcha Express. They also make meal deliveries to those who request help through social media, email, or phone. Additionally, other charities inform them about people in need, and each case is carefully evaluated. Mr. Singh has observed a 50% increase in the number of people seeking free meals due to the rising cost of living. 'We’ve seen more people coming, but we’ll just serve more meals,' he said, emphasizing that they are prepared to meet the growing demand. According to the anti-poverty charity, Trussell Trust, millions of people in the UK are experiencing food poverty, with one in five children affected. Between April 2023 and March 2024, five of the nine regions in England saw an increase in food parcel distribution, with an 8% rise in the East of England alone, amounting to nearly 350,000 parcels. The latest data reveals that 6.3 million adults and 3 million children are living below the poverty line, and many are relying on food banks or at risk of doing so. The total figure of people facing hardship and hunger has reached a record high, with 580,000 more people needing assistance in 2023 compared to the previous year, and the number has risen by a million over the past five years.The post Sikh Charity Tackles Poverty with Free Meals Initiative first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/sikh-charity-tackles-poverty-free-meals/	2024-10-11T14:24:07-07:00	
White House ‘Deeply Concerned’ Over Israeli Fire on UN Peacekeepe...	The White House has expressed 'deep concern' following a report from the United Nations peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon that Israeli forces fired on locations where peacekeepers were stationed, injuring two of them. In a statement on Thursday, a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said, 'We are deeply concerned about reports that Israeli forces fired on two positions and a tower used by U.N. peacekeepers in Lebanon. We immediately reached out to our Israeli counterparts to request more information.' The statement acknowledged Israel's ongoing operations in the region to dismantle Hezbollah infrastructure that poses a threat to its citizens but emphasized that 'it is crucial these actions do not compromise the safety and security of U.N. peacekeepers.'The post White House ‘Deeply Concerned’ Over Israeli Fire on UN Peacekeepers first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/white-house-deeply-concerned-israeli-fire-un-peacekeepers/	2024-10-11T05:17:43-07:00	
Christian Villagers Trapped in Crossfire in South Lebanon	Lebanese Christian Joseph Jarjour had hoped for a peaceful retirement in his hometown of Rmeish in southern Lebanon, but instead, he now finds himself in the middle of the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. 'We're trapped,' said the 68-year-old retired teacher from Rmeish, a village located just two kilometers from the Israeli border. Following nearly a year of cross-border skirmishes, Israel launched a series of airstrikes on Hezbollah strongholds and initiated a ground offensive late last month. Rmeish, along with other Christian villages in southern Lebanon, has largely been spared the worst of the violence, but remains caught in the crossfire between the two sides. 'When Israel bombards, it flies over our heads. And when Hezbollah fires back, it also whizzes by above us,' Jarjour told AFP over the phone during a rare moment of internet access. 'We're peaceful people, we have no weapons, and we have never liked war,' he said. 'We want to stay in our homes and not have to take sides.' Since the escalation began on September 23, more than 1,200 people have been killed in Lebanon, and a million others have been displaced, according to Lebanese health ministry figures. Jarjour added that escaping from Rmeish was difficult as the roads out of the village were unsafe, making it 'very hard' to reach the capital, Beirut. - 'Hostages' - Milad al-Alam, the mayor of Rmeish, a village known for its red-roofed houses and tobacco fields, said most of its 6,000 residents have stayed despite the conflict. However, the walls of several houses have cracked from nearby explosions, and the delivery of fresh produce has stopped. To make matters worse, hundreds of people, mostly Christians fleeing neighboring areas, have sought refuge in Rmeish. 'Life has been at a standstill since October 2023,' said Alam, noting that most businesses have shut down since the fighting began. Hezbollah and Israel have been long-standing adversaries, and since Hezbollah opened a front in support of Hamas following the October 7 attack on Israel, fighting has intensified. 'Anyone who had savings has spent them over the past few months,' Alam said. During the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, most of Rmeish's residents remained in the village. Recently, Alam managed to organize a delivery of humanitarian aid to the area, under the protection of the Lebanese Army and U.N. peacekeepers. 'But we can't replace the state,' he said, lamenting Lebanon's political paralysis and ongoing financial crisis since 2019. Christian-majority villages have largely been spared the recent bombardments, unlike neighboring Shiite-majority areas, which have seen widespread destruction and evacuation. In January, Maronite Patriarch Beshara al-Rahi, the spiritual leader of Lebanon’s largest Christian community, said that villagers along the border had become 'hostages' bearing the brunt of the conflict. Lebanon is home to 18 officially recognized religious communities, with Christians making up about 30 percent of the population. - 'Bound to our land' - Last week, the Israeli military warned residents of southern Lebanon to leave their homes as it prepared for 'limited' ground incursions across the border. However, in the village of Qlayaa, just four kilometers from the border, hundreds of families have remained in their homes despite fuel and medicine shortages, and the closure of the nearest hospital. Priest Pierre al-Rahi said they had stayed because they were 'believers tied to their land.' 'We've done everything to avoid military operations or installations here,' he added. Israel occupied the village from 1982 until 2000, during which time some Lebanese Christians sided with Israel while others opposed the occupation. In the mornings in Qlayaa, home to a statue of Saint George, few people venture outside as the sound of bombardment echoes overhead. Pauline Matta, a mother of four children aged four to 18, said she broke down in tears when she saw Israel’s warning to evacuate. The 40-year-old is constantly on edge. 'I can't stand the sound of shelling or Israeli planes anymore. I scream whenever I hear them,' she said. Despite her fear, she cannot imagine leaving her home or how her family would survive elsewhere on her husband's modest army salary. 'This war was forced on us. We have nothing to do with it. Why should we leave?' she asked. 'I am determined to stay.'The post Christian Villagers Trapped in Crossfire in South Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/christian-villagers-trapped-crossfire-lebanon/	2024-10-11T05:17:34-07:00

Blinken: US Seeks Lebanon Solution, Not Broader Conflict	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed optimism on Friday for a diplomatic solution in Lebanon while emphasizing the importance of preventing a wider conflict in the region. He voiced support for Lebanon’s fragile government to strengthen its authority against Hezbollah. Blinken reiterated that Israel, which has been conducting deadly airstrikes on Lebanon, has 'a right to defend itself' against Hezbollah but also raised concerns about the humanitarian situation. Speaking after an East Asia Summit in Laos, Blinken said, 'We are actively engaging to prevent a broader conflict in the region.' He stressed the need to create conditions that would allow people to return to their homes safely, stating, 'Israel has a legitimate interest in ensuring the security of its citizens, and the people of Lebanon want the same security. We believe that the best way forward is through diplomatic negotiations, something we've been working on for a while and are focusing on now.' Blinken further highlighted the importance of supporting the Lebanese state as it seeks to strengthen its position, saying, 'It is clear that the people of Lebanon have a strong interest in the state asserting itself and taking responsibility for the country’s future.' He also addressed the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, voicing concerns about the limited aid reaching those in need. 'I am deeply concerned about the insufficient assistance getting to them,' Blinken said, adding that the U.S. has been 'very directly engaged with Israel' on this issue.The post Blinken: US Seeks Lebanon Solution, Not Broader Conflict first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-seeks-lebanon-solution-not-broader-conflict/	2024-10-11T05:17:12-07:00

Lebanon’s UN Ambassador Calls for Immediate Ceasefire, Israel Vow...	Lebanon's U.N. Ambassador, Hadi Hashem, has called for an immediate ceasefire, while Israel's envoy stated that military operations would continue until Hezbollah's influence in southern Lebanon is dismantled, preventing further attacks on Israel. During an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting convened by France, Hashem argued that Israel’s bombings and ground invasion would not bring security or stability for its people. He emphasized, 'Israel cannot return the displaced to their homes without a proper agreement.' Hashem affirmed Lebanon's commitment to a French-American initiative for a 21-day ceasefire, intended to resolve border disputes. However, he accused Israel of initially agreeing to the initiative before backtracking and intensifying its aggression. Israel’s U.N. Ambassador, Danny Danon, responded by saying Israeli forces are focused on weakening Hezbollah, preventing future attacks on Israel, and dismantling the terror network that spans southern Lebanon. Danon stressed that peace between Israel and Lebanon requires the removal of Hezbollah. He also called for the full implementation of the 2006 U.N. Security Council resolution that ended the last Israel-Hezbollah conflict. This resolution includes disarming all armed groups, including Hezbollah, and ensuring the Lebanese Army controls the entire southern region of the country.The post Lebanon’s UN Ambassador Calls for Immediate Ceasefire, Israel Vows to Continue Attacks first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lebanons-un-ambassador-ceasefire-israel-attacks/	2024-10-11T04:20:14-07:00	
Hezbollah Launches Drone Attack on Israeli Base in Haifa	Hezbollah announced on Friday that it had carried out a drone attack targeting a military base in Haifa, located in northern Israel. This action followed deadly airstrikes in central Beirut the previous day, as the group continues its clashes with Israeli forces along the border. In a statement, Hezbollah confirmed that it had launched 'an air attack using explosive-laden drones' directed at the 'air defense command base' in Haifa. The group described this attack as retaliation for Israeli strikes on 'cities, villages, and civilians.' Earlier, Hezbollah had also claimed responsibility for a rocket attack on Israeli forces in Zofolon, north of Haifa. According to Al-Arabiya television, 30 rockets were fired at Haifa and the Galilee region on Friday morning.The post Hezbollah Launches Drone Attack on Israeli Base in Haifa first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-launches-drone-attack-israeli-base-haifa/	2024-10-11T04:19:50-07:00	
Mikati: Blinken Reveals Major Push for Ceasefire	Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati on Friday called on the United Nations to pass a resolution demanding an 'immediate' ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. Mikati informed reporters that the Lebanese foreign ministry would request the U.N. Security Council to issue a resolution calling for a 'full and immediate ceasefire.' He also emphasized that his government remains committed to Resolution 1701, which was adopted in 2006 and mandates that only the Lebanese army and peacekeepers be stationed in the southern part of the country. Mikati further disclosed that he had a conversation with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. 'The discussion was focused on seriously pursuing a ceasefire, and we received full support for Lebanon,' he said. He emphasized the ongoing efforts to broker a ceasefire, adding, 'We are prepared to bolster our army's presence along the southern border, but the international community must pressure Israel to uphold Resolution 1701.' Mikati also stressed the importance of ending violence against civilians, stating, 'My appeal is for a ceasefire and an end to targeting civilians. Where is the humanity in this? We send out a cry of conscience to the world.' In response to a question regarding the deadly airstrikes in central Beirut on Thursday, Mikati noted that Israel had recently reduced the intensity of its airstrikes on Beirut’s southern suburbs due to international mediation efforts. In a separate statement, Mikati also called for the election of a new president who would be 'accepted by all Lebanese.'The post Mikati: Blinken Reveals Major Push for Ceasefire first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/blinken-reveals-major-push-ceasefire/	2024-10-11T04:19:12-07:00	
Breaking: Israel’s Deadliest Strike in Central Beirut Stuns Leban...	Rescue teams were sifting through the debris of a collapsed building in central Beirut on Friday morning, following two Israeli airstrikes that struck the Lebanese capital. The attack left at least 22 people dead and dozens injured. The airstrikes, which were the deadliest in central Beirut in over a year of conflict, targeted two residential buildings in neighborhoods now housing large numbers of displaced people fleeing Israeli bombardments from other parts of Lebanon. According to Hezbollah's Al-Manar TV and Israeli media, the strikes were aimed at Wafiq Safa, a high-ranking Hezbollah security official. However, Al-Manar reported that Safa was not present in either of the buildings. The Israeli military declined to comment on these reports. The strikes on Thursday night occurred as Israel ramped up its offensive against Hezbollah, launching heavy airstrikes across Lebanon and initiating a ground invasion along the border. The escalation follows more than a year of intermittent exchanges of fire between the two sides. In Beirut's Burj Abi Haidar neighborhood, civil defense teams and municipal workers were digging through the rubble of a three-story building that was destroyed by the strike. An adjacent building was also heavily damaged. Ahmad al-Khatib, who was in the damaged building with his wife, Marwa Hamdan, and their 2 ½-year-old daughter, Ayla, recounted the terrifying moment the blast hit. He had just picked up his wife from work, and she was praying when the explosion occurred. 'The world suddenly turned upside down, and everything went dark,' said the 42-year-old, tears streaming down his face. He managed to pull his daughter out from under the debris of a collapsed wall. His wife was thrown against a wall by the force of the explosion, suffering a head injury from a piece of metal. 'I looked at her and shouted, 'Say something!'' he recalled, but she could only respond with moans of pain. She is currently in intensive care at a Beirut hospital, while their daughter sustained minor injuries. Another resident, Mohammed Tarhani, had sought refuge with his brother in the same neighborhood after escaping airstrikes in southern Lebanon. His children were on the veranda when the explosion occurred. 'We rushed out to find the children,' he said. 'Where can we go now?' Civil defense official Walid Hashash stated that no more bodies are expected to be found in the rubble, as there are no missing people. He added that once the rescue operations are complete, a final death toll will be released.The post Breaking: Israel’s Deadliest Strike in Central Beirut Stuns Lebanese as They Dig Through Rubble first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israels-strike-central-beirut-stuns-lebanese/	2024-10-11T04:18:19-07:00	
Biden and Netanyahu Hold ‘Productive’ Talks on Retaliation Agains...	U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris had what the White House described as 'productive' discussions with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday, focusing on Israel's response to the recent missile attack by Iran. The White House issued a statement saying, 'This morning, President Biden spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel, and Vice President Harris joined the call.' It was mentioned that a detailed readout of the conversation would be released later. According to White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, the 30-minute call was described as 'direct,' 'honest,' and 'productive.' She added that the U.S. and Israeli governments had been in discussions since the missile attack by Iran last week, with those conversations continuing during the call between Biden and Netanyahu. Jean-Pierre noted that talks about Israel's potential response would continue but declined to provide further specifics until the official readout of the call was published. This call comes at a time of heightened tensions between Biden and Netanyahu and marked their first conversation since August 21, following a seven-week hiatus during which Israel also launched an offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon. President Biden has previously urged Israel not to target Iran's nuclear facilities or oil infrastructure, warning that such actions could spike oil prices just weeks before the U.S. presidential election. A new book by journalist Bob Woodward highlights the growing friction between the two leaders, with Biden reportedly telling Netanyahu in July that Israel's global image is increasingly viewed as 'a rogue state, a rogue actor,' according to a report by The New York Times.The post Biden and Netanyahu Hold ‘Productive’ Talks on Retaliation Against Iran first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/biden-netanyahu-productive-talks-retaliation-iran/	2024-10-10T01:42:29-07:00	
Gallant Vows ‘Lethal, Precise, and Surprising’ Strike on Iran	Israel's Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, issued a stern warning on Wednesday, stating that Israel’s response to a recent Iranian missile attack would be both 'lethal' and 'surprising.' In a speech to Israeli troops, Gallant emphasized, 'Our strike will be lethal, precise, and most importantly, unexpected. They won't understand what happened or how it occurred, but they will see the consequences. Whoever attacks us will suffer and pay the price.' This warning follows Iran's missile attack on Israel on October 1, which the United States assisted in defending against. U.S. President Joe Biden has made it clear that he would not support retaliatory strikes on sites connected to Iran's nuclear program.The post Gallant Vows ‘Lethal, Precise, and Surprising’ Strike on Iran first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/gallant-lethal-precise-surprising-strike-iran/	2024-10-10T01:05:54-07:00	
Israeli Army Confirms Killing Hezbollah Leader in Syria Strike	On Wednesday, the Israeli military announced that its forces had killed a Hezbollah operative in Syria as part of ongoing efforts to target the group’s positions and members. According to a statement from the Israeli army, the air force conducted a strike that 'neutralized Adham Jahout, a member of Hezbollah's 'Golan Terrorist Network' operating in Syria.' The army described Jahout as a key figure who acted as an intermediary, passing information from the Syrian regime to Hezbollah.The post Israeli Army Confirms Killing Hezbollah Leader in Syria Strike first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-confirms-killing-hezbollah-leader-syria-strike/	2024-10-10T01:05:46-07:00	
US Warns Israel Against Repeating Gaza Destruction in Lebanon	The United States issued a warning to Israel on Wednesday, urging against carrying out military actions in Lebanon similar to those seen in Gaza, following a statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who threatened Lebanon with 'destruction' comparable to what occurred in Palestinian territories. Despite this, Israel's military chief, Herzi Halevi, promised to continue the heavy bombing campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon, which has resulted in over 1,200 deaths since September 23. He stated that the bombings would persist without giving Hezbollah any opportunity to recover. These developments followed a highly anticipated phone conversation between Netanyahu and U.S. President Joe Biden, their first discussion in seven weeks. The call, which lasted 30 minutes, was described by the White House as 'direct,' 'honest,' and 'productive.' Although the conversation's details were not immediately released, discussions were expected to center around Israel's response to last week's missile attacks by Iran. When questioned about the call, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris acknowledged its importance but declined to share specifics, stating that they were 'classified.' White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre confirmed that ongoing discussions with Israel on its military responses would continue. Meanwhile, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who was originally scheduled to visit Washington on Wednesday to discuss Israel's actions, had his trip postponed by Netanyahu. Gallant emphasized that Israel’s retaliation against Iran would be 'deadly, precise, and surprising.' Iran had launched approximately 200 missiles at Israel, claiming it was in retaliation for the deaths of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. Many of these missiles were intercepted by Israeli and allied air defenses. President Biden has advised Israel to avoid targeting Iran’s nuclear facilities, fearing significant retaliation, and has discouraged strikes on Iranian oil infrastructure, which could disrupt global oil prices. A source from the Lebanese government told AFP that Hezbollah had agreed to a ceasefire with Israel on September 27, following the Israeli strike that killed Nasrallah. However, Israel's subsequent actions derailed the ceasefire plans, which had U.S. and allied support. Since Nasrallah’s death, the Lebanese government reported no further communication with Hezbollah. Meanwhile, clashes between Hezbollah fighters and Israeli forces continued in southern Lebanon, with Hezbollah using rocket-propelled weapons to resist Israeli attempts to breach the border. In northern Israel, two people were killed by suspected Hezbollah rocket fire in Kiryat Shmona, and Israeli air defenses intercepted two projectiles aimed at the coastal town of Caesarea. Lebanese officials reported that an Israeli airstrike killed at least four people in the Chouf district, southeast of Beirut, an area that had previously been relatively untouched by Israel's intensified bombing. Israel's bombardment of Hezbollah positions in Lebanon, which began on September 23, has displaced more than a million people, according to AFP's count based on official statistics. Israeli ground troops entered Lebanon on September 30, with Israeli forces reporting the elimination of terrorists in close combat and aerial strikes over the past 24 hours, alongside the destruction of 100 Hezbollah targets. Since the ground offensive began, 13 Israeli soldiers have been confirmed dead, according to the Israeli military.The post US Warns Israel Against Repeating Gaza Destruction in Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-warns-israel-repeating-gaza-destruction-lebanon/	2024-10-10T01:05:35-07:00	
Lebanon Arrests Two Syrians Suspected of Spying for Israel	The Lebanese Army announced on Wednesday the arrest of two Syrians suspected of being recruited to spy for Israel, as Israel continues its military strikes on Hezbollah targets within Lebanon. According to a statement shared on social network X by Lebanese army intelligence, the two Syrians were apprehended for 'photographing various locations' and documenting the aftermath of Israeli airstrikes. The arrests were made as part of ongoing efforts to monitor and track down Israeli spy networks and agents within the country. The statement further explained that the two individuals had also recorded 'search and rescue operations and the recovery of bodies' at sites hit by Israeli airstrikes. The pair were reportedly recruited through social media, and the case is now under investigation by judicial authorities. Israel has been carrying out air raids in Lebanon for more than two weeks, targeting Hezbollah commanders and their munitions. These strikes, which began on September 23, have resulted in over 1,200 deaths, according to an AFP count based on official sources. Lebanon is still technically at war with Israel, and any contact or travel between Lebanese citizens and Israel is strictly prohibited. In recent weeks, tensions have heightened following Israeli strikes that killed several senior Hezbollah commanders, including their leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. Over the years, Lebanese security forces have arrested numerous individuals on suspicion of collaborating with Israel, with some receiving prison sentences of up to 25 years.The post Lebanon Arrests Two Syrians Suspected of Spying for Israel first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lebanon-arrests-two-syrians-spying-israel/	2024-10-10T01:05:23-07:00	
Israeli Strike on Derdghaiya Kills 5 Civil Defense Members	Lebanon's civil defense authority reported that an Israeli airstrike on Wednesday resulted in the deaths of five of its personnel in the southern part of the country. The health ministry condemned the strike, which targeted rescue workers. According to the civil defense body, the five personnel were killed while stationed at a civil defense center in the predominantly Christian village of Derdghaiya, located in the Tyre district. They were on duty, prepared to respond to emergency calls when the strike occurred. Lebanon's health ministry noted that the death toll of five is provisional and urged the international community to take a 'firm stance' against Israel’s repeated attacks on rescue and ambulance teams.The post Israeli Strike on Derdghaiya Kills 5 Civil Defense Members first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strike-derdghaiya-kills-5-civil-defense-members/	2024-10-10T01:05:07-07:00	
Biden Urges Netanyahu to ‘Minimize Harm’ to Lebanese Civilians	On Wednesday, U.S. President Joe Biden highlighted the importance of reaching a diplomatic solution to ensure the safe return of both Lebanese and Israeli civilians to their homes on either side of the Blue Line during a phone conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to a statement from the White House. The statement also noted that President Biden reiterated Israel’s right to defend its citizens from Hezbollah, which has launched thousands of rockets and missiles into Israel in the past year. However, he also stressed the importance of minimizing harm to civilians, particularly in the heavily populated areas of Beirut.The post Biden Urges Netanyahu to ‘Minimize Harm’ to Lebanese Civilians first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/biden-netanyahu-minimize-harm-lebanese-civilians/	2024-10-10T01:04:50-07:00	
Biden to Discuss Israel’s Iran Strike with Netanyahu	U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to have an important phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday morning regarding Israel's planned strikes on Iran, as reported by three U.S. officials to Axios. This call would be their first conversation in two months of tension and comes as Israel considers significant military action that could escalate the conflict in the region. On Tuesday night, Netanyahu met for several hours with senior ministers and heads of Israel's military and intelligence agencies to decide on the timing and scale of Israel's planned response, according to two Israeli officials. The retaliation is expected to be significant, potentially involving airstrikes on military sites in Iran and covert operations, like the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Israel is also considering targeting Iran's oil infrastructure, a move Biden has signaled he would oppose. An aide to Netanyahu informed Axios that, once a decision is made, Netanyahu would want to brief Biden. A U.S. official stated that Washington aims to 'use the call to try and shape the limitations of the Israeli retaliation.' The U.S. wants Israel to target significant sites without excessive force. The Biden-Netanyahu call is expected one week after Iran launched approximately 180 ballistic missiles at Israel. While most were intercepted, some caused minor damage to Israeli air bases, and a few landed near Mossad headquarters in Tel Aviv without causing any damage. The Iranian attack was in response to Israeli assassinations of key Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iranian officials. Tehran claimed it would not escalate further unless Israel attacked Iran again, while Israel vowed retaliation. U.S. and Israeli officials believe this cycle of retaliation will continue, with both countries coordinating closely to counter Iranian responses. Last Friday, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told Israel's Minister for Strategic Affairs, Ron Dermer, that the U.S. expects 'clarity and transparency' from Israel about its plans, given their implications for U.S. forces and interests in the region. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant was planning to travel to Washington on Tuesday, but the trip was blocked by Netanyahu, who insisted Gallant wait until Biden's call and approval from Israel's security cabinet for the attack plans. The upcoming call between Biden and Netanyahu was already arranged before the disagreement between Netanyahu and Gallant. According to U.S. officials, Biden and Netanyahu are also expected to discuss the ongoing conflicts in Lebanon and Gaza.The post Biden to Discuss Israel’s Iran Strike with Netanyahu first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/biden-discuss-israels-iran-strike-netanyahu/	2024-10-09T06:06:59-07:00	
Iran FM Heads to Saudi for Talks on Gaza and Lebanon	Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi will travel to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday for discussions about stopping Israeli attacks on Gaza and Lebanon, according to Iran's foreign ministry. Hamas and Hezbollah are both part of the Iran-backed 'Axis of Resistance' of militant groups in the region. Araghchi's visit to the Gulf kingdom is part of Iran's diplomatic efforts, coordinated with regional countries, ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei said on X (formerly Twitter). The visit aims to halt 'the Israeli regime's genocide and aggression' and reduce the suffering of people in Gaza and Lebanon, Baghaei added. Relations between predominantly Shia Iran and Sunni-majority Saudi Arabia were restored in March 2023 after a China-brokered deal ended a seven-year diplomatic rift. Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter and custodian of Islam's two holiest sites, suspended U.S.-led negotiations on normalizing relations with Israel after the onset of the Gaza conflict. Iran has repeatedly accused Israel, its longstanding rival, of committing genocide and war crimes since the beginning of the Gaza conflict. During a visit to Beirut on Friday, after the conflict spread to Lebanon, Araghchi expressed Iran's support for a 'simultaneous' ceasefire in Lebanon and the Palestinian territories. Iran also described Hamas's October 7, 2023, attack on Israel as 'a turning point in the history of the legitimate struggle of the Palestinian people against Israel.'The post Iran FM Heads to Saudi for Talks on Gaza and Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/iran-fm-heads-saudi-talks-gaza-lebanon/	2024-10-09T06:06:52-07:00	
Report: US Pushes for Comprehensive Peace in the Region	The United States is reportedly pursuing a 'comprehensive pacification' effort in the region, as revealed by Israel's Channel 12 in an unannounced move. These efforts are said to focus on achieving calm across all regional fronts, and, as of now, Israel is not actively involved in these discussions, according to the channel. Channel 12 cited senior Israeli officials who said they recently learned of talks between the United States, Arab countries, and Iran, involving a potential comprehensive ceasefire. This ceasefire would cover multiple conflicts, including the Israeli escalation in Lebanon and the support fronts launched by Houthi forces from Yemen and pro-Iran factions in Iraq. It remains unclear whether these efforts will also include the Gaza front. The report mentioned that 'Israel has not yet participated in these talks nor communicated its stance to the United States.' Senior Israeli officials were quoted as saying, 'Israel is currently in a position of strength,' and that any ceasefire would be on its terms, which would include the withdrawal of Hezbollah forces to north of the Litani River and the dismantling of all military facilities of the group in border areas. This news comes as Israel prepares to respond to the missile attack carried out by Iran on October 1, while reports indicate that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, after a long period of absence, is communicating with mediators to explore potential opportunities to restart negotiations.The post Report: US Pushes for Comprehensive Peace in the Region first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-pushes-comprehensive-peace-region/	2024-10-09T06:06:44-07:00	
Israeli Strike on Wardanieh Leaves at Least 4 Dead	The Lebanese Health Ministry reported that an Israeli airstrike on a hotel, which was being used as a shelter for displaced people in southern Lebanon, killed at least four individuals.

'Vice President (Kamala) Harris and I remain fully committed to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist,' Biden declared in a statement. He also reflected on the impact of the attacks on both Israelis and Palestinians, labeling the onset of the conflict as a tragic day for Palestinians as well.

UN Coordinator, UNIFIL Chief Push for Negotiated Solution	U.N. Special Coordinator for Lebanon Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert and UNIFIL Head of Mission and Force Commander Lt. Gen. Aroldo Lázaro have advocated for a 'negotiated solution' to resolve the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. Reflecting on the year since the conflict's escalation, they noted, 'It's been a year since the daily exchanges of fire began across the Blue Line, starting with Hezbollah firing rockets into Shebaa Farms, in breach of the cessation of hostilities and Security Council resolution 1701 from 2006. This year has seen a tremendous loss of life, massive displacement, and severe devastation, leaving civilians on both sides in desperate need of security and stability.' They expressed disappointment that their continuous calls for restraint, protection of civilians, adherence to international humanitarian law, and the resumption of political processes as per resolution 1701 have been ignored. 'One year on, what began as near-daily exchanges of fire has intensified into a relentless military offensive, creating a humanitarian disaster of immense scale. With ongoing Israeli bombardments now a daily reality in Lebanon, and Hezbollah's continued rocket and missile attacks on Israel, the human cost is unspeakable, with countless killed or injured and hundreds of thousands displaced,' they stated. Plasschaert and Lázaro highlighted that every act of aggression only serves to further distance the parties from the peace envisioned in resolution 1701 and the conditions necessary for lasting civilian security on both sides of the Blue Line. They concluded by emphasizing that continued violence and destruction would not address the root issues or enhance safety in the long term. Instead, they stressed that negotiating a solution is the only way to achieve the security and stability that civilians from both sides urgently need and deserve, urging immediate action towards this end.The post UN Coordinator, UNIFIL Chief Push for Negotiated Solution first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/un-coordinator-unifil-push-negotiated-solution/	2024-10-08T06:35:39-07:00	
Breaking: Israeli Army Launches Operations Against Hezbollah in S...	On Tuesday, the Israeli military announced it had initiated precise strikes against Hezbollah targets in southwest Lebanon, further intensifying its ground operations along Lebanon's coastline after increasing troop deployment. According to an official statement on its Telegram channel, 'Yesterday (Monday), the 146th Division began limited, localized, targeted operational activities against Hezbollah terror targets and infrastructure in southwestern Lebanon.' This military action follows warnings issued by the Israeli military to the residents of over a dozen towns and villages in southwestern Lebanon to evacuate, including Naqoura, which houses U.N. peacekeepers. On Monday night, the Israeli army designated four areas in northwest Israel as 'closed military zones' following the advisory for evacuations along the nearby Lebanese coast. The areas identified were Rosh HaNikra, Shlomi, Hanita, and Arab al-Aramshe in northern Israel, with entry to these areas prohibited starting at 22:00 that day. Israel has urged evacuations from several dozen communities in southern Lebanon, most of which are north of the U.N.-declared buffer zone set up following the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. The objective of these Israeli operations is to stop a year-long barrage of Hezbollah rocket fire, allowing thousands of its northern residents to safely return home. Meanwhile, Hezbollah has declared it will continue its attacks until a ceasefire is achieved in Gaza. The conflict, which intensified in mid-September, has resulted in the displacement of over 1 million Lebanese.The post Breaking: Israeli Army Launches Operations Against Hezbollah in Southwest Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-army-operations-hezbollah-lebanon/	2024-10-08T06:35:01-07:00	
US Urges Israel to Spare Beirut Airport	The United States has cautioned Israel against targeting Beirut airport and the access roads leading to it amid ongoing intensive airstrikes in Beirut’s southern suburbs. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller emphasized the importance of keeping these routes open not only for Americans seeking to leave Lebanon but also for international citizens. On Monday, Israeli forces launched an airstrike near Beirut’s international airport, as reported by a security source to AFP. This comes during a time when the U.S. has been organizing near-daily charter flights to evacuate American citizens and their families due to the escalating conflict with the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah. According to Miller, around 900 people have utilized these flights, though none have reached full capacity yet. Additionally, the U.S. is reserving seats on still-operating commercial flights for those wishing to leave. Approximately 8,500 Americans have reached out to the State Department regarding departure options, although this number doesn't necessarily reflect those intending to leave. Miller chose not to comment on whether the Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon, specifically Beirut, adhere to international law, stating, 'I don’t have a characterization of them one way or the other,' but he noted that the expectation is for operations to target Hezbollah in compliance with international humanitarian law, aiming to minimize civilian casualties. The U.S. has occasionally criticized Israel for the high civilian death toll in Gaza, where over 41,000 fatalities have been reported over the past year, with President Joe Biden describing some of Israel’s actions as 'over the top.' However, the U.S. continues to support Israel’s broader military efforts. Israel’s recent military actions were triggered by a deadly attack from the Palestinian militant group Hamas on October 7, 2023, and have since extended from Gaza, where Hamas is based, to targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon. While the U.S. backs Israel’s offensive against Hezbollah, Miller expressed concerns about the potential for these operations to extend indefinitely, stating, 'We are very cognizant of the many times in the past where Israel has gone in on what looked like limited operations and has stayed for months or for years. And ultimately, that’s not the outcome that we want to see.'The post US Urges Israel to Spare Beirut Airport first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-urges-israel-spare-beirut-airport/	2024-10-08T05:47:19-07:00	
Hezbollah Vows to Spare Israeli Troops Near Peacekeepers	Hezbollah has instructed its fighters to refrain from attacking Israeli forces who have positioned themselves behind a U.N. peacekeeping base near the Lebanese border village of Maroun al-Ras. This directive was issued following a statement from UNIFIL, the U.N. peacekeeping operation, which labeled Israel’s nearby military activities as 'extremely dangerous' and a threat to their peacekeepers’ safety. UNIFIL had also noted that it had repeatedly communicated its concerns to Israel. The decision by Hezbollah was intended to protect the lives of U.N. peacekeepers, according to a statement from one of its field commanders. Hezbollah has accused Israel of using the U.N. forces as human shields in these operations. Despite suggestions from Israel that UNIFIL should relocate, the peacekeeping body confirmed on Saturday that it would maintain its positions along the border. Meanwhile, Israel has recently announced its intention to conduct limited ground operations into southern Lebanon. Over the past week, there have been several clashes and attempted infiltrations by Israeli troops near Maroun al-Ras, as reported by Hezbollah. Since September 23, Israel has escalated its military actions in Lebanon, resulting in over 1,110 deaths and displacing hundreds of thousands. These developments come amidst an already severe economic crisis in Lebanon. The deployment of the Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeepers in southern Lebanon was a key provision of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which was aimed at ending the 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.The post Hezbollah Vows to Spare Israeli Troops Near Peacekeepers first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-spare-israeli-troops-peacekeepers/	2024-10-08T05:46:53-07:00	
Qassem Backs Berri’s Ceasefire, Assures Hezbollah’s Strength	On Tuesday, Hezbollah's Deputy Chief Sheikh Naim Qassem declared that the group's military strength remains robust despite enduring weeks of intense Israeli airstrikes. During a televised speech, Qassem emphasized Hezbollah's resilience and operational successes, noting, 'Hundreds of rockets and dozens of drones have been launched, targeting numerous Israeli settlements and cities&#8230; I assure you that our capabilities are intact.' Qassem's statement came on the anniversary of intensified hostilities that escalated into a full-blown conflict last month. He confidently asserted that Hezbollah would continue to extend its rocket fire deeper into Israeli territory, resulting in further displacement of Israelis. He further highlighted that Hezbollah has effectively filled positions left by commanders who were casualties of recent Israeli airstrikes, stating, 'There are no vacant posts.' He mentioned that the organization would appoint a new leader to follow Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed last month in a strike on an underground base in south Beirut, though he acknowledged the challenges posed by the ongoing war. 'The organization and its leadership remain tightly structured&#8230; We have weathered severe setbacks,' Qassem remarked, reflecting on the losses sustained, including that of Nasrallah and other key figures since September 23. In his address, Qassem mourned the late secretary-general but expressed motivation from Nasrallah's resilience. Addressing the Israeli army chief directly, he predicted failure for the Israeli forces: 'The longer the war drags on, the greater Israel's predicament will become.' 'We are steadfast and, God willing, we will triumph&#8230; We will not plead for peace nor will we be the first to falter,' he continued, expressing confidence in defeating Israel and critiquing the Israeli military's inability to make significant ground advances in southern Lebanon. He described any territorial gains by Israel as inconsequential and expressed a readiness to engage the enemy, suggesting that Israeli losses could potentially hasten the end of the conflict. Furthermore, Qassem expressed support for political efforts aimed at achieving a ceasefire with Israel, led by Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, whom he referred to as the 'big brother' and in whom he places complete trust. Al-Arabiya television reported that Lebanese politicians interpret Qassem's remarks as effectively passing leadership responsibilities to Nabih Berri during these critical times.The post Qassem Backs Berri’s Ceasefire, Assures Hezbollah’s Strength first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/qassem-backs-berris-ceasefire-assures-hezbollahs-strength/	2024-10-08T05:46:29-07:00	
Hezbollah Launches 85 Rockets Over Haifa, Israel Hits Dahieh	On Tuesday, the Israeli military reported that around 85 projectiles were launched from Lebanon towards northern Israel, impacting areas including the Upper Galilee, Central Galilee, and Haifa Bay, coinciding with a televised address by Hezbollah's deputy chief, Naim Qassem. During this attack, a 70-year-old woman suffered moderate injuries from shrapnel, and Israeli media showcased footage showing light damage to structures in the vicinity of Haifa, a major coastal city. Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the barrage, describing it as a 'large rocket salvo' directed at Haifa and its northern suburbs. The group stated that the attack was a retaliatory measure against Israeli assaults on urban areas and civilians in Lebanon. In a related event, Israel conducted a severe airstrike on Haret Hreik, a southern suburb of Beirut.The post Hezbollah Launches 85 Rockets Over Haifa, Israel Hits Dahieh first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-launches-85-rockets-haifa/	2024-10-08T05:46:13-07:00	
US Trust in Israeli Govt. Fades as Official Denies Seeking War wi...	Recent weeks have seen the Biden administration grow 'increasingly distrustful' of the Israeli government's statements about its military and diplomatic strategies amid ongoing conflicts, according to reports from Axios based on information from four U.S. officials. The trust issues have been exacerbated by Israel's planned retaliation against Iran for a significant missile attack, necessitating coordination with the U.S. given potential ramifications for American forces and interests. While the U.S. is not opposed to Israel responding, it expects any actions to be proportionate. During a recent discussion, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan emphasized to Israel's minister for strategic affairs, Ron Dermer, the U.S.'s expectation for 'clarity and transparency' regarding Israel's retaliation plans. Sullivan conveyed that without clear communication, the U.S. might not automatically support Israel against further Iranian attacks, although U.S. officials acknowledge that America would likely aid Israel's defense if needed. The level of communication has been a point of contention, with the U.S. often caught off guard by Israeli military or intelligence actions. Examples include unnoted Israeli airstrikes in the Middle East and significant operations like the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, which occurred without prior U.S. knowledge. These actions followed assurances from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to President Joe Biden about progressing towards a ceasefire and hostage release with Hamas. Further strains were evident when U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin learned of the assassination of Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah just minutes before Israeli jets bombed targets in Beirut, viewing it as a breach of trust. Despite these tensions, discussions between the U.S. and Israel continue. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, speaking with Austin, mentioned that Israel had not yet finalized its plans for striking back at Iran. Gallant is scheduled to meet with U.S. officials in Washington to discuss the matter further. An Israeli official noted that while Israel recognizes U.S. concerns and welcomes their input, it will respond to the Iranian attack decisively, ensuring that its actions do not escalate into a broader conflict with Iran.The post US Trust in Israeli Govt.

Macron Urges Netanyahu: The Time for a Ceasefire Is Now	On the eve of the anniversary marking last year's Hamas attacks against Israel, French President Emmanuel Macron had a phone conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. During this call, Macron emphasized France's steadfast support for Israel's security and advocated for a ceasefire in the ongoing conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon, according to the French presidency. The discussion occurred amid tense relations, following Macron's recent public statements advocating for a halt to the provision of arms used in the Gaza conflict, stressing the need for a political resolution. Although Macron clarified that France was not supplying weapons itself, his comments had sparked a pointed response from Netanyahu the day prior. During their conversation, Macron and Netanyahu candidly addressed the current Middle Eastern conflicts, acknowledging their differing views but expressing a mutual desire for understanding. The French president reassured Netanyahu of France's dedication to Israel's security, mentioning the deployment of French military resources in response to recent Iranian attacks. The call highlighted ongoing tensions and the complex geopolitical landscape, with Israel actively engaged in military operations against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, and facing threats from Iran.The post Macron Urges Netanyahu: The Time for a Ceasefire Is Now first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/macron-netanyahu-time-ceasefire-now/	2024-10-07T03:26:33-07:00

Hezbollah launched an attack against Israeli troops in a southern Lebanese village on Monday, while the Israeli military has increased its presence in the region by deploying an additional division for operations in Lebanon. According to Hezbollah, they struck Israeli forces gathered in Maroun al-Ras park with a barrage of rockets. This followed their earlier strikes across northern Israel and other military locations along the border. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed the deployment of the 91st Division to southern Lebanon, marking the third division to engage in the ground offensive against Hezbollah. Continued Conflict on Anniversary Hezbollah also reaffirmed its commitment to continue fighting against what it calls Israeli 'aggression,' especially significant on the anniversary of the Hamas attack on October 7, which sparked the current conflict in Gaza. Despite the heavy toll on Lebanon, Hezbollah expressed steadfastness in its resistance against Israeli forces, labeling Israel as a malignancy that must be eradicated. Casualty Reports The IDF reported the death of a soldier on Lebanon’s northern frontier, underscoring the ongoing danger since the initiation of ground operations against Hezbollah last week. Master Sergeant Etay Azulay was identified as the soldier who was killed during combat. Concerns for UN Peacekeepers Tensions have also escalated near the U.N. peacekeeping bases, as the Israeli military begins establishing a forward operating base close to these locations, potentially endangering peacekeepers. Despite requests from the Israeli military, UNIFIL, tasked with overseeing Israeli withdrawal since the 1978 invasion, has refused to abandon some of its positions in anticipation of the Israeli ground incursion.The post Hezbollah Bombs Israeli Troops in Maroun al-Ras as Israel Deploys Third Division first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-bombs-israeli-troops-maroun-al-ras/	2024-10-07T03:26:20-07:00	
Hezbollah Strikes Base Near Haifa After Another Intense Night	Early on Monday, Hezbollah announced that it had attacked an Israeli military installation near Haifa, marking the third such assault on military positions in that area within a single day. According to a statement from the group, Hezbollah militants fired Fadi 1 rockets at the Carmel base south of Haifa late Sunday. This followed two previous strikes on another military site also located south of Haifa, which the group dedicated to their late leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed last month in an Israeli strike on Beirut's southern suburbs. In response to ongoing threats, the Israeli military issued a renewed call on Sunday night for civilians to evacuate parts of Beirut's southern suburbs, a Hezbollah stronghold that has been under intense bombardment since last month. Military spokesman Avichay Adraee delivered the evacuation warning via social media platform X, specifying the areas of Burj al-Barajneh and Hadath as imminent targets due to their proximity to Hezbollah facilities. Following the evacuation warnings, Beirut's southern skyline was again illuminated by airstrikes, intensifying after what was already the heaviest bombardment since the escalation of aerial attacks on September 23. An earlier airstrike on Sunday in the town of Qmatiyeh, southeast of Beirut, resulted in the deaths of six individuals, including three children, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. Over the weekend, more than 30 airstrikes were reported by Lebanon's state-run National News Agency, while Israeli forces noted that approximately 130 projectiles had been fired from Lebanon into Israeli territory. Residents of Beirut described the overwhelming and terrifying sounds of the conflict, with one labeling it 'a night of terror.' In a particularly tragic incident, an airstrike in the coastal village of Jiyyeh killed three sisters and their aunt. A neighbor stressed the civilian nature of the targeted home by pointing out the victims were all women. The recent surge in violence follows Israel's initiation of a limited ground operation in southern Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah following the killing of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and several senior leaders. This conflict represents the most severe fighting between Israel and Hezbollah since their month-long war in 2006. The ongoing hostilities have resulted in the deaths of at least 1,400 Lebanese, including civilians and Hezbollah combatants, and have displaced over 1.2 million people. Israel maintains that its objective is to eliminate Hezbollah's presence near its borders to allow for the safe return of Israeli citizens.The post Hezbollah Strikes Base Near Haifa After Another Intense Night first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-strikes-base-haifa-intense-night/	2024-10-07T03:26:04-07:00

The military released a statement noting that General Kurilla's visit centered on addressing these current security challenges, particularly those related to Iran and the northern border, although it did not detail when he arrived in the country.The post US CENTCOM Chief Discusses Iran and Lebanon During Israel Visit first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-centcom-discusses-iran-lebanon/	2024-10-07T03:25:39-07:00	
Israelis, Fighting on Multiple Fronts, Commemorate One Year Since...	Israelis commemorated the one-year anniversary of the devastating October 7, 2023, Hamas attack with vigils and solemn events on Monday. This attack, which occurred during a significant Jewish holiday, was the deadliest in Israel's history, initiating the ongoing conflict in Gaza and severely impacting the national psyche. The unexpected nature of the attack eroded the public's trust in their leadership and military, leaving a lasting impact that continues to influence the region today. The repercussions are still felt as Israel not only contends with the ongoing conflict in Gaza but also faces a new confrontation with Hezbollah and an intensifying struggle with Iran, a supporter of both Hamas and Hezbollah. On the anniversary, Hamas continued its resistance, launching rockets that triggered air raid sirens as far as Tel Aviv and near the Gaza border. In Gaza, the heavy toll of the conflict is ever-present, with no formal commemoration planned due to the extensive destruction and displacement caused by the Israeli counterattacks. Across Israel, people gathered at various memorials and cemeteries, while the Israeli Knesset lowered its flags to half-staff. An official state ceremony, which was pre-recorded in Ofakim to minimize disruption, focused on acts of bravery and hope. However, dissatisfaction with the government's handling of the attack and ongoing frustration over unreturned hostages led to a separate gathering in Tel Aviv by the families of victims. The size of this event was significantly reduced due to restrictions on large assemblies, a consequence of the ongoing missile threats from Iran and Hezbollah. The grim reality persists for the many hostages still held, with continuous upheaval in border communities and widespread displacement. The conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon are ongoing, with Israeli actions under scrutiny from international courts and relentless global criticism. The war has inflicted severe casualties, displacing a large portion of Gaza's 2.3 million residents, exacerbating a humanitarian crisis marked by extensive hunger and leaving the region heavily damaged despite repeated attempts at negotiating ceasefires led by the U.S.The post Israelis, Fighting on Multiple Fronts, Commemorate One Year Since Oct. 7 first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israelis-multiple-fronts-commemorate-year-oct-7/	2024-10-07T03:25:23-07:00	
Thousands Rally Globally for Ceasefire Ahead of Gaza War Annivers...	On the eve of the first anniversary of the conflict between Israel and Hamas set for October 7, large-scale protests erupted globally over the weekend. Demonstrators in various cities worldwide called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon amid ongoing hostilities involving Israel, Hamas, Iran, and Hezbollah, the latter supported by Iran. According to data from Gaza's health ministry, validated as credible by the United Nations, Israel's counterattacks have resulted in over 41,000 deaths, predominantly among civilians. Israel has escalated its military activities, now including a ground invasion in Lebanon, in response to recent missile attacks from Iran, raising concerns about the conflict broadening into a larger war. Demonstrations were particularly notable in Washington, where over a thousand people rallied outside the White House, urging the U.S. government under President Joe Biden to halt military support and aid to Israel. A dramatic incident occurred during the protests when a man set his arm on fire, which was quickly extinguished by police and onlookers. Simultaneously, support for Palestine saw thousands rallying in cities across continents, including Europe, Africa, Australia, and the Americas, demanding an end to the hostilities in Gaza. Violence marked the protests in Rome, where clashes between young protesters and the police involved the hurling of bottles and firecrackers, prompting police retaliation with tear gas and water cannons. This confrontation resulted in injuries to a police officer and the detention of two protesters. In Berlin, authorities detained 26 individuals at a pro-Israeli event who were accused of hurling insults, with the event drawing around 650 attendees. London's 'National March for Palestine' was vocal with chants like 'stop bombing civilians' and 'hands off Lebanon,' reflecting the global outcry against the bombings. Lebanon’s Prime Minister Najib Mikati, amidst this turmoil, advocated for international pressure on Israel to cease fire, aligning with US and French efforts to negotiate a truce. His comments coincided with new Israeli airstrikes targeting Hezbollah in Beirut’s southern suburbs, which were followed by additional strikes later, intensifying the situation.The post Thousands Rally Globally for Ceasefire Ahead of Gaza War Anniversary first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/thousands-rally-ceasefire-gaza-war-anniversary/	2024-10-06T02:29:12-07:00

Speaking to France Inter on Saturday, Macron emphasized the need for a political solution and confirmed that France has not been providing weapons to Israel.

Israeli Military Official: 'Preparing Response' to Iranian Attack	An Israeli official reported to AFP that Israel's military is preparing a response to Iran's recent missile attack. The official, who remained unnamed due to restrictions on speaking publicly, did not specify what the response would entail. Haaretz, a left-leaning newspaper, has cited military sources saying that the response will be substantial. According to these sources, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) are planning a significant military strike against Iran, prompted by the missile barrage earlier in the week from Tehran. The paper also noted that further missile attacks from Iran might occur after Israel's retaliatory action. Iran had fired approximately 200 missiles towards Israel on October 1, marking its second direct assault in under six months. Israel's air defense systems intercepted most of these missiles, with only a few hitting military targets and causing minimal damage and no casualties. This missile launch by Iran was said to be in retaliation for the killing of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah by an Israeli airstrike in Beirut on September 27. Additionally, Iran linked this assault to the death of Ismail Haniyeh, a former leader of Hamas, who was killed in Tehran on July 31. Iran and Hamas have accused Israel of being behind Haniyeh's assassination, although Israel has not publicly acknowledged these claims.The post Israeli Military Official: 'Preparing Response' to Iranian Attack first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-military-official-preparing-response-iranian-attack/	2024-10-06T02:05:18-07:00	
Netanyahu Warns Israel Is Fighting on Seven Fronts	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that, almost a year following the Hamas attacks, Israel is currently engaged in conflicts across seven different fronts. In a recent video address, he outlined the various adversaries Israel is confronting, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, the Houthis in Yemen, militant groups in both the West Bank and the Shiite militias operating in Iraq and Syria, and Iran itself. Netanyahu highlighted Iran's recent action of launching over 200 ballistic missiles directly at Israel, accusing it of orchestrating the multi-front offensive. Netanyahu emphasized Israel's ongoing efforts to alter the strategic dynamics in the north with Lebanon, noting that Israel has conducted close to 9,000 strikes there since October 8, in response to around 1,500 attacks from Hezbollah, according to data from ACLED. He also defended Israel's actions in Gaza, citing the right to self-defense, and reaffirmed the nation's commitment to rescuing 101 hostages. He criticized French President Emmanuel Macron and other leaders who have called for arms embargoes against Israel, asserting that Israel will persist in its fight for national security and global peace. The conflict has been severe, with over 1,400 people killed by Israeli strikes in Lebanon in the past month and nearly 7,500 injured, as reported by Lebanon's health ministry.The post Netanyahu Warns Israel Is Fighting on Seven Fronts first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/netanyahu-warns-israel-fighting-seven-fronts/	2024-10-06T02:05:07-07:00	
Israeli Military Encircles Jabalya in Northern Gaza Amid Deadly S...	The Israeli military has reported that it has surrounded Jabalya in northern Gaza and is actively conducting operations in the region. In preparation for this ground operation, they executed several airstrikes targeting alleged weapons storage, underground facilities, terrorist cells, and military infrastructure in the area. According to a CNN journalist, these strikes focused mainly on eastern Jabalya and nearby Gaza City, lasting around 90 minutes. The Palestine Red Crescent Society reported that these strikes resulted in the deaths of two individuals and injured others, with one of the strikes impacting an apartment close to a UNRWA clinic in the Jabalya refugee camp. The Israeli military has stated its objective is to dismantle Hamas's infrastructure in the area due to detected activities aimed at restoring their operational capabilities. They have communicated their intention to continue these operations as necessary to meet their strategic goals. Back in May, CNN had covered the Israeli military's resumed operations in northern Gaza, following claims made in January that they had dismantled the command structure of Hamas there. Despite these efforts, there were indications that Hamas was attempting to regroup, casting doubt on the feasibility of Israel's aim to completely eliminate Hamas from Gaza. Recently, the Israeli military advised civilians in northern Gaza to evacuate, with a new evacuation map being published for the area. Avichay Adraee, the Arabic-speaking spokesperson for the Israeli military, mentioned the expansion of a 'humanitarian area' in Al-Mawasi that includes access routes, field hospitals established since the war began, and areas providing essential supplies like food, water, and medical resources. Journalists have reported that evacuations began late Saturday, with Palestinians moving towards Gaza City in response to the military warnings.The post Israeli Military Encircles Jabalya in Northern Gaza Amid Deadly Strikes first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-military-encircles-jabalya-northern-gaza/	2024-10-06T02:04:57-07:00	
Israeli Strike on Central Gaza Mosque Leaves 21 Dead, Death Toll ...	The number of casualties from an Israeli airstrike on a mosque in central Gaza has increased to 21, as reported by the local Civil Defense and a hospital situated close to the site. Video footage from CNN depicted the frantic efforts to extract bodies from the debris following the nocturnal strike on the mosque in Deir el Balah. Originally reported at 18, the death toll was later updated to 21 by sources from the Civil Defense and the Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, located directly opposite the mosque. In a desperate search for survivors amid the mosque's wreckage, civilians along with civil defense and hospital personnel scrambled in darkness, aided only by the light from their cellphones, as shown in the CNN video. The video captured distressing scenes where bodies lay strewn about, with rescuers calling out as they discovered each person. In one instance, a man is heard shouting, 'He’s alive, by God he’s alive,' as he attempts to aid a non-responsive victim on the ground. Rescue efforts included a group of men successfully extracting another man, barely alive, from beneath a heavy block, while another appeared to have been killed by the strike. Victims, visibly wounded and covered in dust, were hastily transported on blankets to the nearby hospital. The Israeli military acknowledged conducting the strike, describing it as 'precise' and aimed at a Hamas 'command and control' center that they claimed was located within the mosque complex.The post Israeli Strike on Central Gaza Mosque Leaves 21 Dead, Death Toll Rises first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strike-central-gaza-mosque-21-dead/	2024-10-06T02:04:48-07:00	
UAE Ships 40 Tons of Medical Aid to Lebanon	On Saturday, an aircraft from the United Arab Emirates carrying 40 tons of critical medical supplies landed in Lebanon, part of the UAE's campaign, 'UAE stands with Lebanon,' as confirmed by a Lebanese Ministry of Health official to CNN. The UAE's foreign ministry declared the start of its relief efforts to aid Lebanon on the same day. The ministry highlighted that this aid delivery underlines the UAE's dedication to humanitarian efforts and signifies the strong brotherly ties between the two nations, especially during challenging times. According to the UAE’s foreign ministry, this gesture is part of a broader commitment wherein the UAE will provide $100 million in aid to Lebanon. The ministry also expressed its concerns about the growing conflict in Lebanon and its potentially destabilizing effects on regional stability. This development follows the announcement by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday of nearly $157 million in U.S. humanitarian assistance intended to support those affected by the ongoing conflict in Lebanon and surrounding areas. Recent weeks have seen the displacement of up to one million individuals within Lebanon, triggered by intensified military actions by Israel against Hezbollah. This figure includes over 200,000 people, predominantly Lebanese and Syrians, who have sought refuge in Syria, as reported by the United Nations.The post UAE Ships 40 Tons of Medical Aid to Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/uae-ships-40-tons-medical-aid-lebanon/	2024-10-05T07:21:52-07:00

Hezbollah is currently unable to establish contact with Hashem Safieddine, a key figure viewed as a potential successor to the recently deceased leader Hassan Nasrallah, a Lebanese security source reported to CNN. Safieddine has been unreachable following an Israeli airstrike in Beirut’s southern suburbs on Friday. Safieddine, who is Nasrallah's maternal cousin, was a prominent candidate for leadership, having previously headed Hezbollah’s executive council. Both he and Nasrallah studied together in Iran during the 1980s. In a statement last month, after attacks targeted Hezbollah's communication devices, Safieddine declared that his group would persist in its efforts 'until the end.' The United States has recognized Hezbollah as a foreign terrorist organization since 1997 and specifically designated Safieddine as a terrorist in 2017.The post Breaking: Hezbollah Loses Contact with Nasrallah’s Potential Successor first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-loses-contact-nasrallahs-potential-successor/	2024-10-05T07:21:44-07:00	
Breaking: Israel Kills Hamas Military Wing Leader in Lebanon Airs...	An Israeli airstrike near Tripoli, Lebanon's northernmost city, resulted in the death of a key figure from Hamas’ military faction. The Israel Defense Forces and the Shin Bet intelligence agency confirmed they targeted and killed Saeed Atallah Ali, a high-ranking Hamas operative in Lebanon. They accused him of conducting terrorist activities against Israeli interests and recruiting for Hamas within Lebanon. This incident marks a rare attack on Tripoli, a city that had not seen such military actions since the 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. Typically, Israeli strikes have concentrated on southern Lebanon and Hezbollah's bases around southern Beirut. Hamas acknowledged the loss of Atallah Ali, describing him as a prominent leader in their Al-Qassam Brigades' Lebanon operations. The attack, which Hamas labeled as a 'treacherous Zionist bombing,' also claimed the lives of Ali's wife and two daughters. It took place at their residence in the Beddawi refugee camp, situated on a hill roughly 5 kilometers northeast of Tripoli. Visuals from the site depicted significant damage to an apartment building, with debris around and sheets draped from a balcony, partially covering the destruction. This airstrike is part of the broader ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, which escalated from exchanges starting October 7, 2023. Additionally, Israel and Hezbollah have been engaged in consistent hostilities since the following day. Hezbollah has declared it will continue its operations against Israel until a ceasefire is reached in Gaza.The post Breaking: Israel Kills Hamas Military Wing Leader in Lebanon Airstrike first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-kills-hamas-military-wing-leader-airstrike/	2024-10-05T07:21:35-07:00	
Watch: Breaking: Israeli Military Vows 'Serious and Significant' ...	The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have announced they are preparing a robust response to the recent Iranian ballistic missile strike, which involved approximately 200 missiles, as reported by the Times of Israel last Saturday. The IDF has stated that this attack will not go unanswered and that it will have significant repercussions. In a detailed operation, the IDF's Commando Brigade and the elite Yaholam Unit took decisive action against Hezbollah by destroying several tunnel shafts that were reportedly being used by militants to approach the Israeli border from southern Lebanon. This operation also targeted underground weapon caches, observation points, and rocket launching pads located in southern Lebanese villages. In these intense military activities, the IDF claims to have eliminated dozens of Hezbollah militants through coordinated airstrikes and on-ground engagements. To date, the Israeli military asserts that it has killed over 400 Hezbollah operatives during its ground operations in the region. These operations are described by the IDF as precise and focused, aimed at significantly disrupting Hezbollah's infrastructure along the border. The main objective is to demolish strategic assets within villages close to Israel to ensure the safety of northern Israeli residents and facilitate their return. Additionally, the Israeli forces have concentrated their efforts on what they identify as Hezbollah's strategic strongholds in southern Lebanon, where they have discovered extensive weapon stockpiles. One notable action included an IDF drone strike on a Hezbollah command center located within a mosque at the Martyr Salah Ghandour Hospital compound in the town of Bint Jbeil, southern Lebanon. The IDF highlighted that this strike was executed with precision, based on reliable intelligence.The post Watch: Breaking: Israeli Military Vows 'Serious and Significant' Response to Iran’s Missile Attack first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-military-serious-significant-response-iran/	2024-10-05T05:16:30-07:00

Hezbollah Clashes with Troops at Border as Israeli Airstrikes Pou...	Hezbollah declared on Saturday that its militants were actively engaging Israeli forces in southern Lebanon, highlighting a severe escalation in the conflict. This announcement follows Israel's intensified bombing across Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah strongholds as ground operations intensify near the Lebanese border, marking a significant escalation from previous cross-border exchanges to outright warfare. The latest Israeli airstrikes targeted the northern Tripoli region, hitting the Beddawi refugee camp and killing a Hamas commander and his family. This event underscores the broadening scope of the conflict, which now includes direct strikes in regions previously untouched by the current spate of violence. In Beirut, displaced individuals like Ibrahim Nazzal lament the destruction and express a desire to return to their lands despite the devastation. The conflict has escalated following Iran's unprecedented missile attack on Israel, coupled with ongoing Hezbollah rocket attacks and regional support from Iran's allies. This week's events mark a critical juncture, coinciding with the first anniversary of the significant Hamas attack on Israel on October 7. The situation in Beirut is dire, with airstrikes causing significant damage and civilian casualties, including the recent killing of more than 1,000 people by Israeli actions since September 23. On the ground, Hezbollah has reported that its fighters clashed with Israeli troops after repelling an earlier advance, while Israel claims to have eliminated a substantial number of Hezbollah militants. The conflict has had a significant humanitarian impact, prompting widespread displacement and severe damage to infrastructure, including hospitals. Lebanon's emergency response capabilities are stretched thin, with several medical facilities knocked out of operation and a crucial aid shipment recently arriving in Beirut. This ongoing conflict has drawn international concern, with various global actors urging restraint and a move towards diplomatic resolutions. However, the situation remains volatile, with significant military actions continuing and no clear resolution in sight.The post Hezbollah Clashes with Troops at Border as Israeli Airstrikes Pound Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-clashes-border-israeli-airstrikes-lebanon/	2024-10-05T04:46:59-07:00	
US Delivers Humanitarian Aid to Lebanon	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that the United States will deliver almost $157 million in additional humanitarian aid to support communities affected by conflict in Lebanon and the surrounding region. Blinken detailed that this assistance would benefit internally displaced persons and refugees within Lebanon, as well as those escaping to neighboring Syria. He explained that the American people are providing this vital support, which includes approximately $82 million managed by the Department of State’s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration and another $75 million through the United States Agency for International Development’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance. USAID has already allocated $11.5 million and is coordinating with Congress to release an additional $63.5 million soon to ensure ongoing support to the most vulnerable groups. This aid, comprising emergency food supplies, shelter, blankets, hygiene products, as well as water and sanitation services, aims to provide essential relief to those facing severe hardships, Blinken remarked. Over the past year, the U.S. has contributed nearly $386 million to assist those in Lebanon and Syria affected by escalating conflicts. Blinken highlighted the dire humanitarian crisis in Lebanon, which has displaced over a million people, and reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to supporting the region's most vulnerable. He also called on other donors to increase their contributions to meet the growing humanitarian needs.The post US Delivers Humanitarian Aid to Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-delivers-humanitarian-aid-lebanon/	2024-10-05T04:46:47-07:00

Volunteers Brave Danger to Rescue Pets from Bombed-Out Dahieh	Following the intense Israeli bombardment in Lebanon, many residents were forced to flee their homes quickly, leaving behind their pets in the chaos. Maggie Shaarawi, vice president of Animals Lebanon, has stepped in to help these animals. Due to the stressful environment, many cats hide and are left behind as their owners escape the danger. Shaarawi, along with her team, recently entered a heavily damaged neighborhood in Beirut's southern suburbs to rescue eight cats for a distressed owner who guided them via video call to the location of her cats in her living room. The team successfully located and rescued all the cats, narrowly escaping further destruction in the area, which was subsequently hit by another airstrike. This close encounter with danger highlighted the perilous nature of their mission. The escalation of airstrikes by Israel since September 23 has had devastating effects, killing over 1,000 people and displacing more than a million, according to Lebanese sources. Despite the risks, many residents have managed to bring their pets with them as they evacuate, but others, too attached to leave their animals behind, have chosen to stay despite the dangers. Shaarawi mentioned that so far, her team has managed to save around 120 animals from the Beirut suburbs and an additional 60 from the south. Despite a dangerous encounter with an airstrike, they continued their rescue efforts the following day. The rescue missions are tense and urgent, with animals, especially cats, becoming extremely agitated and fearful, resembling tigers in their frightened state. The team uses mopeds to quickly enter and exit the bombarded areas. Shaarawi described the war as traumatizing for both the animals and their human companions, who are subjected to daily bombings without understanding what is happening around them. They simply wait for their owners' return. Unfortunately, not all rescue missions are successful. In one heartbreaking instance, the team discovered one cat deceased and could not locate two others, presumed dead under the rubble of a destroyed house. The ongoing conflict continues to pose severe risks to both human and animal lives in the region.The post Volunteers Brave Danger to Rescue Pets from Bombed-Out Dahieh first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/volunteers-danger-rescue-pets-dahieh/	2024-10-05T04:46:13-07:00	
Four Lebanese Hospitals Halt Services as Israeli Bombing Intensif...	In recent times, multiple hospitals in Lebanon have been compelled to cease operations due to the ongoing Israeli bombardment. The cease in operations includes four hospitals, notably after Hezbollah-affiliated emergency personnel reported 11 casualties from Israeli strikes in southern Lebanon. Amidst these escalations, Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati has called upon the global community to influence Israel to facilitate access for rescue and medical teams to the sites of bombardments. He highlighted the severe impact on emergency teams, noting the deaths of many emergency workers recently. One such affected facility, Sainte Therese Hospital in Beirut’s southern suburbs, experienced severe damage from nearby Israeli airstrikes, leading to a suspension of all hospital services. Similarly, Mays al-Jabal hospital, located at the Israel-Lebanon border, ceased operations due to direct targeting and logistical challenges affecting supplies and staff movements. In an alarming incident reported by Mouenes Kalakesh, the director of Marjayoun governmental hospital, Israeli airstrikes targeted ambulances at the hospital’s entrance, resulting in fatalities among paramedics and forcing the hospital's closure. The Islamic Health Committee also reported the deaths of several emergency workers in Marjayoun and other locations due to direct strikes. Further complicating the situation, the Israeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee accused Hezbollah of exploiting ambulances for military purposes, warning that such vehicles could be targeted if found transporting combatants or military gear. Additional strikes were reported on the Salah Ghandour hospital in Bint Jbeil, leading to casualties among the medical staff and the evacuation of the facility. This ongoing conflict, which has seen nearly daily exchanges of fire across the Lebanon-Israel border, has significantly escalated since September 23, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis with over 1,110 people killed and up to a million displaced, as per official figures.The post Four Lebanese Hospitals Halt Services as Israeli Bombing Intensifies first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/four-lebanese-hospitals-halt-services-israeli-bombing/	2024-10-05T04:46:05-07:00	
State Department: Duration of Israel’s Ground Incursions in Leban...	The U.S. has engaged in talks with Israel regarding the aftermath of its military operations in Lebanon, though the duration of these activities remains uncertain, the State Department disclosed. State Department spokesperson Matt Miller expressed uncertainty about the future developments. 'I'm not going to prejudge what's going to happen. We don’t know what’s going to happen. Dare I say, the Israelis probably don’t know what’s going to happen at this point,' Miller stated. He emphasized that the U.S. would continue to monitor the situation closely and assess it as it evolves. Miller declined to comment on whether Israel has a definitive strategy for ending the conflict in the north, which has seen increased incursions and strikes in Beirut targeting Hezbollah. 'The Israelis will have to speak to that question, not me,' he remarked. Despite the lack of clear information from U.S. officials regarding the specifics of Israel’s military strategy against Hezbollah, Miller affirmed strong U.S. support for Israel’s targeted actions against the militant group’s infrastructure. He highlighted the U.S. desire for a diplomatic solution while also supporting efforts to weaken Hezbollah’s military capabilities.The post State Department: Duration of Israel’s Ground Incursions in Lebanon Uncertain first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/duration-israels-ground-incursions-uncertain/	2024-10-03T23:52:36-07:00	
Israeli Military Reports 20 Projectiles Fired from Lebanon into I...	The Israeli military reported that after sirens alerted the northern regions of Haifa and Galilee, nearly two dozen projectiles were launched from Lebanon into Israel. A Reuters video captured the moment these rockets were intercepted by Israel's defense systems above Haifa early Friday morning. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) detailed that around 20 projectiles were detected following the sirens, which went off between 7:01 a.m. and 7:04 a.m. local time in the Haifa Bay and Western Galilee regions. Most of these were successfully neutralized by the defense systems, while the remainder landed in unpopulated areas. Israel Police noted that fragments from the interceptions landed mainly in Kiryat Yam, located just north of Haifa, causing some property damage but no injuries were reported. Additionally, at 7:23 a.m. local time, sirens in the Upper Galilee area signaled the crossing of 'multiple projectiles' from Lebanon. The military confirmed that some were intercepted and others fell in open areas, though the full impact of this event remains uncertain.The post Israeli Military Reports 20 Projectiles Fired from Lebanon into Israel first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-military-20-projectiles-fired-from-lebanon-israel/	2024-10-03T23:52:23-07:00	
Hezbollah Leader Agreed to Ceasefire Days Before Assassination	Lebanon's Foreign Minister, Abdallah Bou Habib, revealed to CNN's Christiane Amanpour that just days before his assassination, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah had consented to a 21-day ceasefire. This truce was advocated by U.S. President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, and other international allies during the recent UN General Assembly. Habib confirmed Nasrallah's agreement in the interview, noting that Lebanon, after consultations with Hezbollah and Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berri, had aligned with the ceasefire. He added that both the U.S. and French governments were informed of this agreement, which was also supposedly affirmed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as per the joint statement by Presidents Biden and Macron. The plan was for White House senior adviser Amos Hochstein to travel to Lebanon to negotiate the details of the ceasefire. However, Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut's southern suburbs shortly thereafter. This announcement came just a day after a joint statement by several countries, including the United States, France, and others, calling for a 21-day ceasefire to enable diplomatic efforts and prevent further escalations. Sources close to the negotiations indicated that Hezbollah had agreed to the ceasefire shortly before the U.S. proposal was made public. It was suggested that such an agreement would have required Nasrallah's approval, although it was not confirmed if the decision came directly from him. Conversely, a Biden administration official expressed that they had no prior knowledge of Nasrallah's personal agreement to the ceasefire. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller echoed this sentiment, stating that while diplomatic talks were ongoing about the ceasefire proposal, the U.S. had not been informed of Hezbollah's consent. Hezbollah did not make any public declaration about their stance on the ceasefire. It seemed they were awaiting Israel's response to the international call for a ceasefire issued by the U.S., France, and other allies. Despite the agreement, the ceasefire was short-lived. Netanyahu soon declared that Israel would persist in its aggressive actions against Hezbollah. This discrepancy was later described by Israeli officials as a misunderstanding, believing the ceasefire proposal was merely the beginning of a process towards peace. Following these events, the U.S. refrained from further advocating for the ceasefire once it became apparent that Israel might target Nasrallah. In light of queries regarding the diminishing influence of the United States in the region, Habib emphasized the critical role of the U.S. in achieving a ceasefire, though he remained uncertain about the extent of support Lebanon could expect.The post Hezbollah Leader Agreed to Ceasefire Days Before Assassination first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-leader-agreed-ceasefire-days-before-assassination/	2024-10-03T23:52:08-07:00

Intense Israeli Airstrikes Hit Dahieh, Reportedly Targeting Safie...	Sources familiar with Hezbollah revealed that Israel executed 11 back-to-back airstrikes on the organization's stronghold in southern Beirut late Thursday. This marked one of the most intense bombardments since Israel escalated its offensive last week. According to three Israeli officials cited by Axios, these attacks aimed at eliminating Hezbollah's senior leader, Sayyed Hashem Safieddine. Loud explosions during these raids triggered car alarms and shook buildings across the Lebanese capital, as reported by AFP correspondents. The aftermath was visually captured with footage displaying massive fireballs and dense smoke at the strike site, while flares illuminated the area. Lebanon's National News Agency (NNA) confirmed that this sequence of over ten airstrikes constituted one of the fiercest assaults on Beirut's southern suburbs since the conflict's onset. The impact of these strikes reverberated into the surrounding mountainous regions, added the NNA. Earlier that day, the Israeli army’s Arabic-language spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, issued a critical evacuation warning to residents near the Bourj al-Barajneh area of south Beirut, hinting at imminent military actions due to the proximity of Hezbollah facilities. Further details emerged about another airstrike targeting a warehouse near Beirut airport earlier in the evening, which a Hezbollah-related source discussed with AFP. However, the contents of the warehouse remain unspecified. Reports by the NNA earlier in the day described several 'enemy raids,' with one source mentioning that these earlier strikes aimed at a building used by Hezbollah's media relations, which had been evacuated beforehand. This recent escalation follows Israel's announcement of ground operations in southern Lebanon, subsequent to prolonged aerial bombardments targeting Hezbollah areas throughout Lebanon. This military shift has led to significant casualties, with the conflict claiming over 1,000 lives and displacing hundreds of thousands. This series of events escalated further with the assassination of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah in south Beirut, significantly impacting the densely populated region.The post Intense Israeli Airstrikes Hit Dahieh, Reportedly Targeting Safieddine first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-airstrikes-hit-dahieh-targeting-safieddine/	2024-10-03T23:50:52-07:00

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) disclosed on Wednesday, October 2, that eight soldiers had been killed during their ongoing ground operations against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, marking the first deaths in this phase of their campaign. The IDF released the names of the deceased soldiers, identifying them as follows: 1. Captain Eitan Itzhak Oster, 22, a team commander in the Egoz Commando Unit, from Modi’in. 2. Captain Harel Etinger, 23, a team commander in the Egoz Commando Unit, from Eli. 3. Captain Itai Ariel Giat, 23, from the Yahalom Combat Engineering Unit, residing in Shoham. 4. Sergeant First Class Noam Barzilay, 22, of the Egoz Commando Unit, from Kohav Yair. 5. Sergeant First Class Or Mantzur, 21, of the Egoz Commando Unit, from Beit Aryeh. 6.

Staff Sergeant Ido Broyer, 21, of the Golani Brigade’s reconnaissance unit, from Nes Tziona. The IDF reported that the six commandos from the Egoz unit lost their lives in a firefight with Hezbollah fighters in a village in southern Lebanon. Additionally, the aftermath of this encounter also saw an officer and four soldiers sustain severe injuries. During the operation to evacuate the injured, IDF troops were targeted by mortar fire from Hezbollah, resulting in further casualties. In a separate incident, two soldiers from the Golani reconnaissance unit were killed. Hezbollah claimed it had destroyed three Israeli Merkava tanks on the same day as they moved toward the Lebanese village of Maroun al-Ras, near the border.The post Eight Israeli Soldiers Killed in Lebanon as Clashes with Hezbollah Escalate first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/eight-israeli-soldiers-killed-lebanon/	2024-10-03T03:39:11-07:00	
Israeli Strike on Beirut Health Center Kills Seven Rescuers	Late Wednesday, an Israeli airstrike devastated a Hezbollah-affiliated rescue facility in Beirut's Bashoura district, killing seven paramedics, as reported by the Lebanese health ministry. The strike targeted a multi-story building that included an office of the Islamic Health Organization, a group associated with Hezbollah and comprising civilian first responders. This attack, notably close to Beirut's central downtown area—home to UN and government offices—marked a significant escalation, being one of the nearest strikes to this crucial district. According to the Islamic Health Organization, the airstrike not only resulted in deaths but also left several individuals wounded, destroying a floor of the building in the process. Journalists from AFP in Beirut reported hearing a loud explosion that caused buildings to shake. This incident was part of a series of attacks that included another direct strike on the Islamic Health Organization within 24 hours, both of which occurred without prior warnings from Israel. Typically, Israeli airstrikes have focused on the southern and eastern parts of Lebanon and the southern suburbs of Beirut, areas known for a strong Hezbollah presence. However, the scope of these attacks has expanded across Lebanon, resulting in numerous civilian casualties. Following this particular attack, residents reported a sulfur-like odor, leading to accusations by Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency that Israel used internationally banned phosphorous bombs. There have been previous allegations by human rights groups against Israel for deploying white phosphorus incendiary shells in southern Lebanon's conflict zones. The Israeli military has not yet responded to these allegations or commented on the strike in central Beirut. Additionally, Beirut's southern suburbs endured severe bombings overnight. Israel executed three air raids just before midnight Wednesday, with the blasts audible from several kilometers away. Subsequently, residents in various parts of the densely populated southern Beirut received evacuation orders from the Israeli military, disseminated via social media. The Lebanese health ministry disclosed that, over the past 24 hours, Israeli strikes had killed 46 people and injured 85 across the nation. According to Lebanon's disaster management agency, the death toll since the onset of cross-border exchanges between Israel and Hezbollah following the Gaza war on October 7, 2023, has reached 1,928.The post Israeli Strike on Beirut Health Center Kills Seven Rescuers first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strike-beirut-center-kills-seven-rescuers/	2024-10-03T03:17:29-07:00	
Hezbollah Claims It Thwarted Israeli Advance on Southern Border	Hezbollah successfully repelled an attempt by Israeli forces to advance at a southern Lebanon border point on Thursday. They reported that this confrontation occurred at Fatima's Gate, just one day after Israel confirmed the deaths of eight of its soldiers in the area. On Wednesday, Israel had initiated 'targeted ground raids' in southern Lebanon, during which Hezbollah claimed to have forced Israeli soldiers to retreat, using explosives against an Israeli unit and destroying three Merkava tanks with rockets near the village of Maroun al-Ras. Israel conducted two brief incursions into Lebanon, urging residents to evacuate over 20 areas. They released footage purportedly showing their soldiers navigating through Lebanese villages and mountainous terrain on foot. To bolster their efforts, Israel deployed an additional military division. Iran's missile attack Shortly after Israel commenced ground operations in Lebanon, Iran launched approximately 200 missiles, including hypersonic ones, prompting Israelis to seek shelter. Although Israel intercepted most missiles, two individuals were injured by shrapnel, and a school suffered damage. Some missiles hit air force bases in Israel but caused no casualties or damage. In the West Bank city of Jericho, a Palestinian was tragically killed by debris from a rocket. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant issued a stern warning in response to the attacks, emphasizing the consequences for aggressions against Israel. Despite the tensions, President Joe Biden affirmed U.S. support for Israel but dismissed the possibility of striking Iran’s nuclear sites. Iran's military leadership vowed to escalate their attacks if Israel retaliated. The Revolutionary Guards stated that the missile barrage was in retaliation for the killing of Hezbollah's Nasrallah, Quds Force commander Abbas Nilforoushan, and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. Global reaction The situation has caused significant international concern, affecting global markets and raising oil prices. The UN Secretary-General condemned Iran’s actions, while the G7 pledged to seek diplomatic resolutions to ease regional tensions. Hezbollah initiated strikes on Israeli troops following a Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, which precipitated an extensive Israeli military response in Gaza, resulting in significant civilian casualties.The post Hezbollah Claims It Thwarted Israeli Advance on Southern Border first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-claims-thwarted-israeli-advance-southern-border/	2024-10-03T03:17:08-07:00	
Watch: Breaking: Nasrallah’s Son-in-Law Killed in Israeli Raid on...	The son-in-law of the late Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli raid in Damascus on Wednesday, according to a report by an NGO. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights stated, 'In a residential area of Damascus's Mazze district, an Israeli raid targeted an apartment, resulting in the death of Hassan Jaafar Qassir, Nasrallah's son-in-law, along with another Lebanese individual.' This account was corroborated by a source close to Hezbollah who spoke to AFP. Hassan Jaafar Qassir was the brother of Ahmad Qassir, who conducted a suicide bombing in the southern Lebanese city of Tyre in 1982, killing multiple Israeli soldiers. Another brother, Mohammad Qassir, was killed in an Israeli strike in the Jnah area of Beirut on Tuesday. According to the Israeli military, Mohammad Qassir led Hezbollah’s Unit 4400, responsible for transporting weapons from Iran to Lebanon and overseeing the development of precision-guided missiles. He was also said to have directed substantial financial resources to Hezbollah in recent years.The post Watch: Breaking: Nasrallah’s Son-in-Law Killed in Israeli Raid on Damascus first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/nasrallahs-son-law-killed-israeli-raid-damascus/	2024-10-03T03:16:56-07:00

EU Increases Lebanon Aid by 30 Million Euros	The European Union announced on Thursday that it is providing an additional 30 million euros ($33 million) in humanitarian aid to Lebanon amid ongoing conflicts between Israel and Hezbollah. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated, 'Today, we are stepping up our humanitarian aid to the people of Lebanon. Our new funding will ensure civilians receive much-needed assistance during this very difficult time. I am extremely concerned by the constant escalation of tensions in the Middle East. All parties must do their utmost to protect the lives of innocent civilians.' This recent commitment increases the EU's total humanitarian support for Lebanon this year to over 100 million euros, following a 10 million euro allocation announced earlier in the week. Meanwhile, Israel has intensified its military actions in Lebanon, including a bombing campaign and deploying troops across the border. These actions have resulted in over 1,900 deaths, including the killing of Hezbollah's long-standing leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah in an airstrike. According to Lebanese authorities, the ongoing strikes have displaced approximately one million people.The post EU Increases Lebanon Aid by 30 Million Euros first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/eu-increases-lebanon-aid-30-million-euros/	2024-10-03T03:15:47-07:00

Israel Orders Evacuation of 29 South Lebanon Towns Amid Ground Op...	On Tuesday, the Israeli army instructed residents of 29 southern Lebanese towns to evacuate northward beyond the Awali River, amid what it termed a 'limited' ground incursion. The towns specified for evacuation include Yaroun, Ain Ebel, Maroun al-Ras, al-Tiri, and others, extending to Aitaroun. The Israeli military emphasized the urgency of moving to ensure safety, stating, 'The Israeli army does not want to harm you and for your own safety you must evacuate your homes immediately. Anyone in proximity to Hezbollah members or their military assets is in danger.' The directive specifically advised residents to move north of the Awali River, which is about 60 kilometers from the border and further north than the Litani River. The Litani River previously marked the northern limit of a U.N.-declared buffer zone established after the 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. The army's message warned, 'Be careful, you are not allowed to go south. Going south could put your life in danger. We will let you know when it is safe to return home.' This evacuation order followed shortly after Israeli forces commenced a ground operation in southern Lebanon targeting Hezbollah. The instructions were disseminated by the Israeli military’s Arabic spokesman via the social media platform X.The post Israel Orders Evacuation of 29 South Lebanon Towns Amid Ground Operation first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-evacuation-29-south-lebanon-towns/	2024-10-02T03:40:56-07:00

On Tuesday, the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, reported that there was no ongoing ground incursion in the south of the country, contradicting Israel's claims of conducting limited raids in the area. UNIFIL spokesperson Andrea Tenenti clarified to AFP that there was currently no ground incursion, following Israel's military announcement that it had initiated 'limited, localized and targeted raids' against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. Similarly, Hezbollah refuted the presence of any Israeli ground forces in Lebanon. In their first response since Israel declared the commencement of ground operations, Hezbollah spokesman Mohammed Afifi labeled the reports of Israeli troops entering Lebanon as 'false claims.' He asserted that Hezbollah fighters were prepared to engage directly with any Israeli forces attempting to enter Lebanon to inflict casualties. An Israeli military official indicated that their troops were positioned close to the border, focusing on villages a few hundred meters from Israel. Speaking anonymously in accordance with military guidelines, the official noted that there had been no encounters with Hezbollah fighters on the ground. Additionally, a source from the Lebanese army confirmed on Tuesday that they had not detected any Israeli ground incursion into Lebanese territory, also speaking to AFP under the condition of anonymity.The post UNIFIL, Hezbollah, and Army Deny Israeli Ground Incursion in South Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/unifil-hezbollah-army-deny-israeli-ground-incursion-lebanon/	2024-10-02T03:40:38-07:00

The Israeli military has disclosed that it has been conducting covert ground operations over the past year aimed at dismantling Hezbollah's infrastructure in Lebanese villages near the border, according to military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari. Hagari explained on Tuesday that these operations are an extension of efforts initiated last year. The military has shared video footage showing Israeli soldiers discovering tunnels and weapons caches in at least three Lebanese villages. During these operations, Israeli forces have destroyed over 700 Hezbollah sites. These include tunnels built into hillsides, which contain separate rooms used for storing weapons and apparent living quarters equipped with mattresses. Furthermore, Hagari noted that Hezbollah appears to be planning an attack similar to the one executed on October 7 against Israel, judging by the strategic placement of weapon caches and maps found during the raids. These documents included references to a strategy known as 'Conquer the Galilee.'The post Israeli Military Releases Footage of Past Ground Operations in Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-military-footage-past-operations-lebanon/	2024-10-02T03:40:25-07:00	
Israeli Army Hits Jnah and Kuwait Embassy Roundabout in South Bei...	On Tuesday, the Israeli military executed a targeted strike in south Beirut, according to an IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) statement which did not provide further specifics. Meanwhile, local media reported that the strikes occurred simultaneously at an apartment in a building near al-Zahraa Hospital in Jnah and another location in Beirut's southern suburbs. The Lebanese state-run National News Agency confirmed that Israeli forces targeted two locations in south Beirut. The agency described a 'violent enemy strike' between Jnah and Ouzai, close to al-Zahraa Hospital, followed shortly by another strike near a roundabout close to the Kuwaiti embassy. One of the airstrikes damaged a residential building, shattering windows and impacting an apartment located on the southern highway leading to Beirut international airport, roughly 100 meters from the Iranian Embassy. The IDF claimed responsibility for the death of Mohammed Jaafar Qassir in the afternoon strike. Qassir was reportedly the head of Hezbollah’s Unit 4400, responsible for transporting weapons from Iran to Lebanon and overseeing the development of precision-guided missiles for Hezbollah. Additionally, the Israeli military stated that Qassir had funneled hundreds of millions of dollars to Hezbollah in recent years. Hezbollah has not yet responded to these allegations. Qassir’s brother, Ahmad, was known for carrying out a suicide attack in Tyre, a southern Lebanese port city, in 1982 that resulted in the deaths of numerous Israeli soldiers. His death is commemorated annually as 'Martyr's Day.'The post Israeli Army Hits Jnah and Kuwait Embassy Roundabout in South Beirut first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-army-hits-jnah-kuwait-embassy-south-beirut/	2024-10-02T02:54:09-07:00	
Iran Launches Missile Strike on Israel in Retaliation for Nasrall...	Air traffic at Israel's Ben Gurion airport was suspended on Tuesday following a series of explosions across the country, triggered by a missile attack from Iran, according to a spokesperson. The missile assault by Iran's Revolutionary Guards was reportedly in retaliation for the deaths of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, as well as Revolutionary Guards commander Nilforoshan. 'We targeted the heart of the occupied territories (Israel) in response to the martyrdom of these leaders,' stated the Guards in a release cited by Fars news agency. The Guards also issued a stern warning of 'crushing attacks' against Israel should there be any retaliation. Loud explosions were heard in Tel Aviv and near Jerusalem, with the blasts near Jerusalem causing windows to rattle. Residents were instructed to stay indoors and remain near bomb shelters through alerts on mobile phones and announcements on national television. Sirens were reported in various parts of Jerusalem and central Israel. The Israeli army communicated to the public, 'Iran's attack is ongoing. You are requested to remain in a protected space until further notice. The sounds you are hearing are from interceptions or fallen projectiles.' In response to the attacks, President Joe Biden directed the U.S. military to support Israel's defense by intercepting Iranian missiles aimed at Israel. This directive was issued from the White House, where both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee in the upcoming U.S. presidential election, were monitoring the situation.The post Iran Launches Missile Strike on Israel in Retaliation for Nasrallah’s Killing first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/iran-missile-strike-israel-retaliation/	2024-10-02T02:52:57-07:00

Israeli Strike on Damascus Kills 3, Including TV Anchor, Syrian S...	Safaa Ahmed, a prominent Syrian television anchor, was killed in an overnight Israeli strike on Damascus along with two others, according to a report by the Syrian state news agency SANA. SANA announced that Safaa Ahmed died as a result of what it called a 'treacherous Israeli aggression on the capital, Damascus.' The Syrian defense ministry reported that the Israeli attack, involving drones and planes, occurred around 2 a.m. local time from the direction of the Golan Heights, which Israel occupies. The ministry claimed that its air defense systems engaged the attacking missiles and drones, managing to intercept most of them. However, the strike resulted in three civilian deaths and injuries to nine others. Social media videos, which CNN geolocated, indicate that an explosion occurred near Syria’s Telecom building, located west of the city’s military airport. Another video showed a car ablaze following the explosion. It remains unclear if Ahmed and the other casualties were at this specific location when they were killed; SANA did not provide details on the exact location of their deaths. When approached for comments on these reports, the Israeli military did not provide a statement, maintaining their policy of not commenting on foreign media reports. For context, Israel has intermittently conducted airstrikes in Syria since the attacks by Hamas on October 7 of the previous year, typically without confirming these operations.The post Israeli Strike on Damascus Kills 3, Including TV Anchor, Syrian State Media Reports first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strike-damascus-kills-3-tv-anchor/	2024-10-01T02:55:00-07:00	
Analysis: US Influence Dwindles as Israel’s War Expands	Israel's anticipated military push into Lebanon marks a significant shift, underscoring a year-long conflict that reveals the diminished ability of the United States to control its ally or sway other key combatants in an escalating regional crisis. On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu advanced his campaign against Hezbollah with a so-called 'limited ground operation' in Lebanon. This action came despite prolonged pleas from Washington for Israel to show restraint and continued, albeit ignored, calls for de-escalation. This development occurred shortly after President Joe Biden expressed his support for an immediate ceasefire when queried about recent Israeli special forces operations in southern Lebanon. 'I'm comfortable with them stopping,' Biden stated. His remarks highlighted a growing rift between the U.S. and Israeli administrations. On the same day, Netanyahu boldly proclaimed to the Iranians in a televised message that 'Israel can reach anywhere in the Middle East.' This widening gap between the two governments aligns with the closing stages of a tense U.S. election, where Biden faces restricted political leeway to manage the war's domestic implications without causing further upheaval. This situation is something Netanyahu, who is adept at navigating U.S. political waters, is likely very aware of. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, has generally adhered to the administration's position, despite previous statements suggesting a possibly firmer approach towards Netanyahu and a focus on the hardships faced by Palestinian civilians.The post Analysis: US Influence Dwindles as Israel’s War Expands first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-influence-dwindles-israels-war-expands/	2024-10-01T01:28:59-07:00	
Israeli Strikes Kill at Least 13 in Gaza Refugee Camp, Health Off...	Late Monday night in central Gaza, Israeli airstrikes resulted in the deaths of at least 13 individuals and injuries to several others, as reported by health officials to CNN. The strikes targeted the Nuseirat refugee camp, causing these casualties, according to statements from officials at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital and Al-Awda Hospital in the region. CNN has contacted the Israeli military seeking their comments on the incident. These developments followed a report by Gaza’s Civil Defense stating that an Israeli strike on Tuesday had hit a school in northern Gaza that was sheltering displaced Palestinians, killing at least seven people and injuring others.The post Israeli Strikes Kill at Least 13 in Gaza Refugee Camp, Health Officials Report first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-kill-least-13-gaza-refugee-camp/	2024-10-01T01:28:53-07:00

On Monday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had a conversation with his Israeli counterpart, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, discussing the recent security issues and Israeli military activities, as detailed in a Pentagon summary. During the call, Austin and Gallant concurred on the importance of dismantling the operational capabilities at the border to prevent attacks similar to those on October 7 against northern Israeli communities, as stated by Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder. The Israeli military has initiated a targeted ground operation in southern Lebanon aimed at Hezbollah, according to their reports. Additionally, when President Joe Biden was queried about Israeli special forces' actions in southern Lebanon, he expressed support for an immediate ceasefire, noting his readiness for the operations to cease. The Pentagon statement further highlighted that Secretary Austin assured the U.S. is ready to protect its personnel, partners, and allies against threats posed by Iran and groups supported by Iran. Austin and Minister Gallant also discussed the grave repercussions for Iran should it directly attack Israel militarily.The post US Defense Secretary Talks with Israeli Counterpart as Israel Begins Ground Incursion in Southern Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-defense-secretary-talks-israeli-counterpart/	2024-10-01T01:28:37-07:00	
UAE Pledges $100 Million Aid to Lebanon as UN Urges De-escalation	The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has committed to providing Lebanon with an aid package worth $100 million, as it raises concerns about the precarious situation in Lebanon and its implications for regional stability. This announcement was made by the state-run Emirates News Agency. The UAE's foreign ministry further expressed a strong commitment to Lebanon's unity, national sovereignty, and territorial integrity. The ministry underscored its continued support for the Lebanese people during these difficult times, as stated in a press release. This financial assistance arrives at a critical time, as the United Nations’ Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) highlights the severe impact recent conflicts have had on civilians in Lebanon. OCHA has called on the international community to actively support de-escalation efforts, ensure compliance with international humanitarian law, and prioritize urgent aid for those affected. The situation is further strained by the Lebanese aid sector's current challenges, as noted by the Lebanon country director of Relief International in a CNN interview on Sunday. He mentioned that the sector is struggling due to the displacement of approximately 1 million people in Lebanon following Israeli attacks. Additionally, the World Food Programme is responding to the crisis by initiating an emergency operation to enhance food support for up to 1 million people in need throughout Lebanon.The post UAE Pledges $100 Million Aid to Lebanon as UN Urges De-escalation first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/uae-100-million-aid-lebanon-un-urges-deescalation/	2024-10-01T01:28:15-07:00	
Hezbollah Rockets Strike Israel After Israeli Incursion Into Leba...	This morning, Hezbollah launched attacks on Metula in northern Israel, just hours after an Israeli military operation into Lebanon. Hezbollah confirmed that its forces had targeted an Israeli soldier assembly in Metula using artillery and rocket fire, claiming successful strikes on the targets. The group stated that these attacks were carried out to support the 'steadfast Palestinian people' in Gaza and to defend Lebanon and its inhabitants. In response, the Israeli military reported that it detected about five projectiles coming from Lebanon. Some of these were intercepted, and others were found in the vicinity, though the specific locations of their landing were not disclosed. Additionally, the Israeli forces intercepted two other projectiles in a separate incident. Air raid sirens were activated in the Bar’am area of northern Israel, where one projectile crossed from Lebanon and landed in an open space.The post Hezbollah Rockets Strike Israel After Israeli Incursion Into Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-strike-israel-israeli-incursion-lebanon/	2024-10-01T01:15:53-07:00	
How Will Iran React to Israel’s Escalating Strikes on Its Proxies...	Israel is intensifying its military operations against Iran-supported groups, including launching a limited ground invasion into Lebanon targeting Hezbollah and executing long-range strikes on Houthi forces in Yemen. These actions come amid growing concerns about a potential extensive regional conflict. Hezbollah, the Houthis, and Hamas, which initiated attacks on Israel on October 7, are part of the 'Axis of Resistance' backed by Iran, which includes various Islamist militias across Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Gaza, and Yemen. Over the past year, Hezbollah and the Houthis have frequently attacked Israel, pledging to continue their assaults until the conflict in Gaza concludes. Recently, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly criticized Iran. In a broadcast speech, he expressed solidarity with the Iranian populace, bypassing any intermediaries, and urged them to oppose their leadership. Netanyahu also reiterated his warning about Israel's capability to strike targets anywhere in the Middle East. A U.S. senior official disclosed to CNN that if Iran perceives a threat of losing Hezbollah in this conflict, it might directly intervene. The ongoing Israeli operations have significantly reduced Hezbollah's capabilities, removing hundreds of their fighters from the field. During an operation that eliminated Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah, a high-ranking officer from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp was also killed. In retaliation, Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has threatened Israel with severe repercussions.The post How Will Iran React to Israel’s Escalating Strikes on Its Proxies? first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/how-iran-react-israels-strikes-proxies/	2024-10-01T01:15:44-07:00	
Isn’t Israel Fighting Hamas in Gaza? Why Are Israeli Troops Now i...	Since the conflict in Gaza started last October after Hamas attacked Israel, Israel and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah have seen increased hostilities. Hezbollah has declared it will continue its attacks on Israel until a ceasefire is achieved in Gaza, which has suffered extensive damage due to Israeli airstrikes and ongoing conflict. Recently, Israel has shifted its military focus northward, setting a new objective to facilitate the return of displaced citizens to their homes near the Lebanon border. This adjustment comes after approximately 60,000 Israelis were displaced due to rocket attacks by Hezbollah. This has led to some of the most intense clashes between Israel and Hezbollah since the 2006 war in Lebanon, which resulted in around 1,100 deaths in Lebanon. Last month, Israel conducted a coordinated attack targeting Hezbollah, resulting in numerous casualties and severe injuries among thousands, including women and children, through the explosion of devices like pagers and walkie-talkies. Moreover, Israel has intensified its bombing campaigns in Lebanon, aiming at Hezbollah’s infrastructure and leadership. These bombings have not only targeted militant strongholds but have also destroyed residential areas and neighborhoods, particularly in southern Beirut, resulting in the deaths of several Hezbollah leaders and over a thousand civilians.The post Isn’t Israel Fighting Hamas in Gaza?

Lebanese Army Denies Reports of Withdrawal from Southern Lebanon	On Tuesday, the Lebanese military refuted claims that it had retracted its forces several kilometers from positions along the southern border in response to Israel's recent ground invasion into the region. The Army Command clarified that these reports were not accurate. It explained that Lebanese military units stationed in the south are merely adjusting the positions of some forward observation points within their assigned operational zones, not withdrawing. The army also confirmed its ongoing collaboration with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon to manage the situation. CNN has reported that it cannot independently confirm the movements of the Lebanese army. This response from the Lebanese military came after a Lebanese security source indicated to CNN on Monday that the army had vacated several observation posts along the southern border, relocating to nearby border village barracks.The post Lebanese Army Denies Reports of Withdrawal from Southern Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lebanese-denies-reports-withdrawal-lebanon/	2024-10-01T01:15:26-07:00	
Watch: Israeli Troops Launch Ground Offensive in Southern Lebanon...	Israel has initiated what it describes as a 'limited ground operation' in southern Lebanon, specifically targeting Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militant group. This marks a significant escalation in the year-long conflict, with Israel’s National Security Cabinet declaring this move as the 'next phase' of its war with Hezbollah. This is only the fourth time in nearly 50 years that Israeli forces have publicly entered Lebanese territory, the last being during the 34-day war in 2006. In preparation for the operation, Israel intensified airstrikes, which have killed hundreds and displaced around 1 million people in Lebanon. The most recent escalation came after Israel's assassination of Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, on Friday. The incursion is focused on dismantling immediate threats posed by Hezbollah near the border, but Israeli officials have been unclear on how long the operation will last or how deep into Lebanon their forces will venture. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant stated that Nasrallah’s assassination was a key move but that further actions were planned. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has resisted international calls for de-escalation despite growing civilian casualties in both Lebanon and Gaza. Historically, limited military operations declared by Israel have often evolved into more extended campaigns. This was the case with Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon in 1982, initially presented as a short mission to dismantle the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO). More recently, Israel’s operations in Gaza have similarly escalated beyond their original scope. In the lead-up to this ground operation, Israel’s National Security Cabinet greenlit the next phase of the conflict, while Israeli forces prepared by launching small raids and sealing off northern Israeli communities near the Lebanon border. Hezbollah has continued its attacks on Israel, aiming for a ceasefire in Gaza. Israel's military objectives have shifted northward, particularly after Hezbollah’s rocket attacks displaced around 60,000 Israelis. With rising tensions and the heaviest fighting since the 2006 war, concerns have grown that the conflict could spiral into a wider regional war. In the face of Hezbollah's losses, questions remain about whether its backer, Iran, will become directly involved in the conflict. Israeli leaders, particularly Netanyahu, have signaled that the war is part of a broader strategy to 'change the balance of power' in the Middle East. Iran has been involved indirectly through Hezbollah and other militant groups in the region but has refrained from direct conflict so far. Observers are concerned that any direct Iranian retaliation could potentially draw the U.S. further into the conflict. The U.S. has supported Israel's right to defend itself but has expressed concerns over 'mission creep' that could lead to a longer, more expansive military operation. President Joe Biden proposed a 21-day ceasefire plan, but it was swiftly rejected by Israel, highlighting the ongoing strain between Washington and Tel Aviv in managing the escalating crisis.The post Watch: Israeli Troops Launch Ground Offensive in Southern Lebanon: What We Know So Far first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-troops-offensive-lebanon-what-know/	2024-10-01T01:15:01-07:00	
Israel Declares Northern Border a 'Closed Military Zone'	The Israeli military announced on Monday that it had designated parts of its northern border with Lebanon as a military zone, ahead of potential ground operations. 'The areas of Metula, Misgav Am, and Kfar Giladi in northern Israel have been declared closed military zones, with entry prohibited,' said the military in a statement. This declaration does not necessarily indicate that Israeli forces will imminently enter Lebanon. Such areas can also be restricted if there is a perceived immediate threat. However, the Israeli army has significantly reinforced its presence along the Lebanese border in recent days. Commanders have stated they are ready to deploy forces if ordered by the government. Chris Coyle, a resident of northern Israel, noted that gates and checkpoints had been set up throughout the region, and numerous tanks had been stationed near the border. 'They’re definitely preparing to go in,' he observed.The post Israel Declares Northern Border a 'Closed Military Zone' first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-northern-border-closed-military-zone/	2024-09-30T12:18:19-07:00

Breaking: Israel Conducting Limited Operations Inside Lebanon	The U.S. State Department confirmed on Monday that Israel is conducting limited ground operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon. According to State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller, Israel has informed the U.S. that these operations target Hezbollah infrastructure near the border. On the same day, Israel's Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, hinted at the possibility of a broader offensive against Hezbollah, stating that Israel would deploy forces 'from the air, from the sea, and on land' as needed. This warning came as parts of Israel's northern border with Lebanon were declared a closed zone by the Israeli military. The escalation follows Hezbollah's low-intensity strikes on Israeli forces, which began shortly after Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, sparking conflict in Gaza. Since then, clashes along the border have intensified, with Israeli airstrikes inside Lebanon killing hundreds, including Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. Reports indicate that Israel has already launched small, precision raids across the border and may be planning a larger ground operation, while artillery strikes have been hitting southern Lebanese villages near the border.The post Breaking: Israel Conducting Limited Operations Inside Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-limited-operations-inside-lebanon/	2024-09-30T12:17:08-07:00	
Syrian Refugees Fleeing Lebanon, Returning Home as Conflict Escal...	Syrian refugees who once sought safety in Lebanon are now returning to Syria, facing an uncertain future. According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), around 100,000 people, including both Lebanese and Syrians, have crossed back into Syria to escape Israeli airstrikes. The bombardments have forced one million people to flee their homes in Lebanon, according to the country's caretaker prime minister. Lebanon is home to approximately 1.5 million Syrian refugees, the UNHCR reports. 'They came to Lebanon seeking safety, and now they are reliving that trauma,' said Rula Amin, the senior spokesperson for UNHCR in the Middle East and North Africa. Speaking to CNN’s Michael Holmes, Amin described the situation as 'tragic,' with civilians struggling to find refuge. Israel’s shifting targets in Lebanon make it difficult for people to identify safe areas to shelter. Although residents are advised to avoid Hezbollah-operated areas, the group's secretive nature leaves them unsure where to go. Without sufficient shelters, many are left sleeping outdoors, Amin added. 'We have never seen anything like this before, not even in 2006,' she said, referring to the scale and intensity of the bombings. The widespread attacks have resulted in significant civilian casualties, with Lebanese authorities reporting over 1,000 deaths. Amin noted that UNHCR staff stationed at the Syrian-Lebanese border are witnessing thousands of people fleeing into Syria each day. 'They don’t know what tomorrow holds. All they know is that they need to keep running,' she said.The post Syrian Refugees Fleeing Lebanon, Returning Home as Conflict Escalates first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/syrian-refugees-fleeing-lebanon-returning-home/	2024-09-30T06:33:22-07:00	
Israeli Minister Hints at Imminent Ground Invasion of Lebanon	Israel’s defense minister has provided one of the clearest indications yet that the country is preparing for a ground incursion into Lebanon. 'The elimination of Nasrallah is a significant step, but it is not the final one,' Yoav Gallant told Israeli soldiers on Monday. 'We will use every capability at our disposal, and if anyone on the other side doesn't understand what those capabilities are, we mean *all* capabilities, and you are part of this effort.' Gallant made these remarks during a visit to Israel’s armored corps near the Lebanese border, addressing soldiers from brigade 188 and the Golani brigade, an infantry unit. While Israeli officials have hinted at such a possibility before, Gallant's comments on Monday were more direct, signaling that Israel is moving closer to a ground offensive in southern Lebanon. Last week, Herzi Halevi, Israel’s chief of the General Staff, told troops near the northern border that airstrikes on Lebanon were intended to 'prepare the ground for your possible entry and to continue degrading Hezbollah.' Gallant further emphasized Israel’s commitment to returning citizens who were displaced from their homes in the north of the country due to the conflict. 'We are ready to take every step necessary to accomplish this mission,' he said. 'We will employ all necessary means—your forces, others, from the air, from the sea, and on land. Good luck.'The post Israeli Minister Hints at Imminent Ground Invasion of Lebanon first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-minister-hints-invasion-lebanon/	2024-09-30T06:33:07-07:00

As Israel intensifies its military actions across various fronts in the region, airstrikes in Gaza have continued without much respite. According to Gaza's Ministry of Health, Israeli strikes have claimed the lives of at least 20 Palestinians and injured 108 others over the past 24 hours. The ministry further reported that the total death toll has reached at least 41,615, with 96,359 people wounded since the conflict began. Rescue efforts are hampered by the destruction, with many victims still trapped under debris or stranded on roads, which emergency services are unable to access. The Government Media Office in Gaza estimates that around 10,000 people remain missing and are believed to be buried beneath the rubble. Relief workers have previously informed CNN that damaged infrastructure from Israeli strikes is obstructing efforts to reach survivors. CNN has not independently verified the figures provided by the health ministry, which does not differentiate between civilian and combatant casualties.The post Israeli Strikes in Gaza Have Killed 41,615 Palestinians, Health Ministry Reports first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strikes-gaza-killed-41615-palestinians/	2024-09-30T06:32:49-07:00	
Saudi Arabia Demands Respect for Lebanon’s Sovereignty	Saudi Arabia voiced its 'deep concern' on Monday regarding the escalating conflict in Lebanon, urging that the 'sovereignty and territorial integrity' of the country be upheld. In a statement from the foreign ministry, Saudi Arabia said, 'The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is closely monitoring the situation in the Republic of Lebanon with great concern.' Following reports from Lebanon's health ministry that over a hundred people were killed by Israeli airstrikes on Sunday, Riyadh emphasized the importance of respecting Lebanon's sovereignty. 'The Kingdom calls on the international community to fulfill its responsibilities in maintaining regional peace and security, to protect the region and its people from the devastation of wars,' the statement continued. Israel has been conducting lethal airstrikes in Lebanon for several days, culminating in the death of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Iran-backed Hezbollah, along with other senior members of the group on Friday. As tensions escalate, there are increasing international calls for Israel to show restraint, with concerns mounting over the potential for a full-scale war in the Middle East as Israel prepares for a possible ground offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon.The post Saudi Arabia Demands Respect for Lebanon’s Sovereignty first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/saudi-arabia-respect-lebanons-sovereignty/	2024-09-30T06:32:11-07:00

French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot met with Maronite Patriarch Beshara al-Rahi on Monday, highlighting the urgency of electing a new president in Lebanon and calling for an end to the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, according to a Bkirki spokesperson. Barrot arrived in Lebanon on Sunday evening, making him the first senior foreign official to visit since the escalation of Israeli air strikes. In a meeting with caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati, Barrot conveyed France’s call for 'an immediate halt' to the Israeli strikes. On Monday, he is also scheduled to meet with key Lebanese leaders, including Army Chief Joseph Aoun and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri. France Delivers 12 Tons of Medical Aid to Lebanon France has provided 12 tons of medical supplies to Lebanon, which includes two mobile clinics capable of treating 1,000 critically injured patients currently in hospitals across the country, according to a statement from the French Foreign Ministry. Additionally, French military aircraft have delivered vital medicine to Lebanese emergency, pediatric, and general hospitals and clinics, many of which have been overwhelmed by the influx of injured people since Israel's bombardment began over a week ago. During his visit to Beirut, Barrot announced that France would allocate 10 million euros ($11.1 million) in emergency humanitarian aid to support local organizations, especially the Lebanese Red Cross. 'In the midst of the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, France stands in solidarity with Lebanon and remains committed to protecting civilians,' the statement read.The post France Pledges $11M in Emergency Aid to Lebanon During FM’s Beirut Visit first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/france-11m-emergency-aid-lebanon/	2024-09-30T06:29:54-07:00	
Israel Reportedly Rejects Ceasefire Proposal	Israel announced on Monday that it has rejected a ceasefire proposal with Hezbollah, which had been presented by mediators during recent discussions. According to Al-Hurra's correspondent in Tel Aviv, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz held talks with various foreign ministers following the assassination of Hezbollah Secretary-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. The ceasefire plan was among the topics discussed, but Katz made it clear that Israel would not agree to such a ceasefire in Lebanon. As reported by the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation, Katz communicated this position to more than 25 foreign ministers, including those from Germany, Britain, Italy, and Canada. He stated that Israel would only consider a ceasefire if Hezbollah is pushed north of the Litani River and disarmed. Katz explained that 'the full implementation of all U.N. Security Council resolutions related to Lebanon' is the only pathway to a ceasefire. Until that happens, Israel would continue its military operations to ensure the security of its citizens and allow residents in the northern regions to safely return to their homes. He also defended the assassination of Nasrallah, calling it one of the most justified actions Israel has undertaken, adding that Nasrallah had been planning further attacks against Israel. Katz further warned Iran, saying that any attack from Iran would be met with a retaliatory strike by Israel. Meanwhile, European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell expressed regret last Friday over the lack of influence to 'stop' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s actions in Gaza and Lebanon. Borrell stated, 'We are applying all diplomatic pressure to halt the fighting, but no one seems able to stop Netanyahu, whether in Gaza or the West Bank.' Borrell voiced support for a French and U.S.-led initiative calling for a 21-day ceasefire in Lebanon, but Israel has disregarded the proposal, continuing to intensify its strikes in the country.The post Israel Reportedly Rejects Ceasefire Proposal first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-reportedly-rejects-ceasefire-proposal/	2024-09-30T06:09:35-07:00	
EU Calls Emergency Talks on Lebanon Escalation	European foreign ministers are set to hold emergency talks on Monday to address the escalating situation in Lebanon, according to Brussels, as Israel continues its air strikes following the death of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. A spokesperson announced that Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief, had convened a video meeting at 1500 GMT to discuss the European Union’s response to the worsening crisis in Lebanon. International efforts are underway to prevent the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah from turning into a wider regional war. So far, the 27-member European Union has struggled to present a unified response or wield significant influence to de-escalate the violence that has shaken the region over the past year. On Monday, Israel launched its first air strike in Beirut’s city center since the Gaza conflict erupted last year, killing four people. This raid marked a significant intensification in the ongoing air campaign, which saw the assassination of Hezbollah's long-standing leader, Nasrallah, last Friday, further escalating tensions. Since last Monday, Israeli air strikes have killed hundreds in Lebanon, the deadliest period since the country’s civil war from 1975 to 1990. The Lebanese health ministry reported that more than 700 people have been killed, including 14 paramedics over two days of bombing. The U.N. refugee agency's head, Filippo Grandi, revealed that over 200,000 people have been displaced within Lebanon, while more than 100,000 have fled to neighboring Syria. After nearly a year of a devastating military campaign in Gaza, prompted by Hamas’s attack on October 7 last year, Israel has increasingly shifted its focus toward Hezbollah.The post EU Calls Emergency Talks on Lebanon Escalation first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/eu-calls-emergency-talks-lebanon-escalation/	2024-09-30T06:08:39-07:00

Hezbollah’s deputy leader, Sheikh Naim Qassem, delivered a televised address on Monday in tribute to the slain Hezbollah leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and vowed that the group would continue its fight. 'Sayyed Nasrallah will always remain with us,' Qassem assured Hezbollah’s members and fighters. Contrary to Israeli claims that a meeting of 20 officials was targeted when Nasrallah was killed, Qassem stated that Israel is committing massacres across Lebanon. He also criticized the U.S. for aiding Israel, stating, 'Israel is mistaken if it believes war will help it achieve its objectives.' Despite the unprecedented attacks, Qassem emphasized that Hezbollah has endured and will continue to follow Nasrallah’s path, maintaining its goals and support for Palestine. 'We won’t abandon our positions, and the resistance will keep aiding Palestine,' he said, adding that the battle could be prolonged, but Hezbollah’s fighters are prepared for any ground invasion, and they expect victory. Qassem stressed that Israel will not be able to weaken Hezbollah’s military capabilities and that the group will soon choose a new secretary-general. He also praised Lebanon’s 'national unity,' expressing gratitude to the government, political groups, NGOs, and hospitals.The post Hezbollah’s Qassem Vows to Fight, Promises Swift Replacement for Nasrallah first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/qassem-fight-promises-replacement-nasrallah/	2024-09-30T06:07:13-07:00

Study Suggests Earth Captured the Moon from Space, Rather Than Fo...	For nearly four decades, the widely accepted theory has been that the Moon formed from debris resulting from a massive collision between Earth and another celestial body. However, a new study presents an alternative possibility: What if the Moon wasn't formed this way, but instead was a separate object from space that Earth's gravity managed to capture? During the Apollo missions between 1969 and 1972, astronauts collected over 800 pounds of lunar rocks and soil for analysis. These samples were found to be compositionally similar to materials on Earth, leading scientists to conclude that the Moon originated from Earth, forming around 60 million years after the solar system came into existence. At the 1984 Kona Conference, scientists largely agreed that the Moon had resulted from a collision with a young Earth. But two Penn State researchers, Darren Williams and Michael Zugger, challenge this long-standing theory. Their study, published in *The Planetary Science Journal*, suggests that the Moon may not have formed from this collision after all. Instead, they propose the Moon might have been part of a binary system with Earth—two space bodies orbiting each other—until Earth’s gravity pulled the Moon in and ejected the other object. 'The Kona Conference shaped the prevailing narrative for 40 years,' said Williams, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at Penn State Behrend. But he and Zugger, a senior research engineer at Penn State’s Applied Research Lab, argue that this explanation leaves unresolved issues. Why the Moon likely came from elsewhere One key issue is the Moon's current position. If the Moon had formed from a collision, the debris would have clumped together and formed a ring orbiting above Earth's equator. Yet, the Moon orbits in a plane more aligned with the Sun than with Earth’s equator. 'The Moon’s orbit is more in sync with the Sun than Earth’s equator,' Williams explained. In their binary-exchange capture theory, Williams and Zugger argue that Earth’s gravity captured one of the two objects in the binary system, making it the Moon. The other object was repelled. They also highlight another similar case within our solar system: Triton, Neptune’s largest moon. Current research suggests Triton was captured into Neptune's orbit from the Kuiper Belt, a region filled with binary objects. Initially, according to Williams and Zugger, the Moon’s orbit around Earth was highly elliptical. Over time, extreme tidal forces altered its shape, eventually becoming the near-circular orbit we see today. The researchers calculated the tidal effects and the Moon’s orbit, determining that over thousands of years, the Moon's orbit contracted and became more circular.The post Study Suggests Earth Captured the Moon from Space, Rather Than Forming It first appeared on THE DAILY STAR.	https://dailystar.com.lb/earth-captured-moon-space-rather-forming/	2024-09-28T23:56:14-07:00
