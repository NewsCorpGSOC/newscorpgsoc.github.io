US redirects $100m military aid to Lebanon to support ceasefire	In its final days, the Biden administration has redirected over $100 million in military aid originally allocated to Israel and Egypt, shifting the funds to Lebanon to support a ceasefire agreement brokered between Israel and Hezbollah. According to State Department notifications sent to Congress on January 3 and later obtained by The Associated Press, $95 million intended for Egypt and $7.5 million earmarked for Israel will now aid Lebanon’s military and government. The majority of the redirected funds will support the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF), which play a critical role in implementing the November ceasefire agreement. The funding will help the LAF deploy to southern Lebanon, complementing the efforts of the U.N. peacekeeping mission patrolling the Blue Line, the border demarcation established after the 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. The State Department emphasized the importance of strengthening the LAF to ensure the success of the ceasefire and maintain Lebanon’s territorial integrity. Both Israel and Hezbollah have agreed to withdraw their forces from southern Lebanon by the end of January, with compliance overseen by the LAF and U.N. peacekeepers. The department highlighted that U.S. assistance enhances the LAF’s capacity as Lebanon’s only legitimate military force, helping it counter destabilizing threats from ISIS and other terrorist groups while providing security for Lebanese citizens and U.S. personnel. The notifications also addressed concerns from critics who allege Hezbollah’s influence within the LAF, stating that U.S. support bolsters the LAF as a counterweight to Hezbollah and affirming the LAF’s status as an independent, non-sectarian institution respected across Lebanon’s diverse communities. In addition to military aid, $15 million will be allocated to Lebanon’s Internal Security Forces (ISF) to help them serve as the country’s primary law enforcement body and support the LAF in maintaining control in southern Lebanon. This funding will be used to rebuild police stations, upgrade communication systems, and acquire new vehicles. The administration also announced smaller allocations of $3.06 million to the Palestinian Authority police to assist operations in the West Bank and $2.5 million to Jordan’s Public Security Directorate to enhance its response to public demonstrations.The post US redirects $100m military aid to Lebanon to support ceasefire first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-100m-military-aid-lebanon-support-ceasefire/	2025-01-08T06:39:01-08:00	
Opposition backs Aoun from Maarab as Saudi envoy pushes election	The opposition is set to convene a meeting in Maarab at 7:00 PM to officially declare its support for Army Chief Joseph Aoun's candidacy for Lebanon's presidency, according to media reports on Wednesday. This announcement comes ahead of the presidential election session scheduled by Speaker Nabih Berri. In related developments, Saudi envoy Yazid bin Mohammad arrived in Beirut on Wednesday morning to engage in political discussions aimed at facilitating Aoun's election as president, media sources indicated. Meanwhile, Al-Jadeed television reported late Tuesday on ongoing discussions involving key political figures. Talks were held between Free Patriotic Movement leader Jebran Bassil and Hezbollah official Wafiq Safa, as well as a separate, 'secret' meeting between Bassil and Berri. During his meeting with Berri, Bassil reportedly expressed a preference for selecting a candidate aligned with the international community. He proposed former ministers Jihad Azour and Ziad Baroud as potential options, according to Al-Jadeed.The post Opposition backs Aoun from Maarab as Saudi envoy pushes election first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/opposition-backs-aoun-maarab/	2025-01-08T06:38:55-08:00	
Le Drian lands in Lebanon to tackle political deadlock	France’s special envoy to Lebanon, Jean-Yves Le Drian, held a meeting in Beirut on Wednesday with Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri as part of his efforts to help Lebanon resolve its prolonged presidential vacancy. The presidency has remained unfilled for over two years due to deep political and sectarian divisions. Lebanon’s parliament is set to convene on Thursday to elect a president, and Le Drian will attend the session at Berri’s invitation. His visit is part of broader international efforts to facilitate the election, in line with the principles established during the Doha meeting in July 2023. Le Drian is collaborating with representatives of the Quintet — France, the United States, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt — to break the political deadlock. In a statement, Le Drian called on Lebanese lawmakers to find common ground, stressing that electing a president is a critical first step toward reactivating Lebanon’s institutions and restoring its sovereignty. Reports from local media suggest that Le Drian is advocating for the election of Army Chief Joseph Aoun, a leading candidate, ahead of Thursday’s parliamentary session. The evolving political dynamics in Lebanon have added uncertainty to the situation. Hezbollah, a significant force in Lebanese politics, has faced setbacks in recent months following its conflict with Israel, which resulted in the deaths of key officials, including its longtime leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. Compounding this is the fall of President Bashar Assad’s government in Syria, a longtime ally of Hezbollah. The vacancy in Lebanon’s presidency has persisted since October 2022, when former President Michel Aoun, a close ally of the Iran-backed Hezbollah, completed his term.The post Le Drian lands in Lebanon to tackle political deadlock first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/le-drian-lands-lebanon-political-deadlock/	2025-01-08T06:38:44-08:00	
Shiite Duo’s position on Joseph Aoun’s election revealed	Hezbollah and the Amal Movement remain opposed to the nomination of Army Chief Joseph Aoun for Lebanon's presidency, according to a report by al-Jadeed TV on Wednesday. The Shiite Duo maintains its position that electing Aoun would require a constitutional amendment, which they firmly oppose. Their sources reiterated that their primary choice for the presidency remains Suleiman Franjieh, while they are open to considering other candidates, including Major General Elias al-Bayssari. However, they emphasized that they would not support a president whose election would violate the constitution or compromise national sovereignty, indirectly referencing Aoun. According to the Lebanese constitution, senior civil servants, such as Aoun, must vacate their positions at least six months before being eligible for the presidency. The report also noted that Hezbollah and Amal continue to hold discussions and coordinate with the Free Patriotic Movement. However, they will not officially announce their candidate before the presidential election session. Later in the day, al-Jadeed reported that MP Mohammad Raad from Hezbollah conveyed to French envoy Jean-Yves Le Drian that Hezbollah would not obstruct a broad Lebanese consensus on a presidential candidate.The post Shiite Duo’s position on Joseph Aoun’s election revealed first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/shiite-duos-position-joseph-aouns-election-revealed/	2025-01-08T06:38:36-08:00	
Bassil declares votes for Aoun as spoiled	Lebanese lawmakers are set to vote for a new president on Thursday, but divisions persist among political factions regarding the leading candidate, Army Chief Joseph Aoun. Aoun appears to have the backing of international powers, including the United States, France, and Saudi Arabia, but faces resistance from some domestic parties. The Free Patriotic Movement (FPM), led by Jebran Bassil, has not officially declared its candidate. Bassil has argued that electing Aoun would violate the constitution, stating in an interview with LBCI that any vote for Aoun in the January 9 session should be considered invalid. Instead, he has expressed support for former finance minister and International Monetary Fund official Jihad Azour, as well as acting security chief Elias Baissari. Bassil emphasized that when the FPM proposed Azour over a year ago, he was not intended as a confrontational candidate. However, Hezbollah dismissed Azour as a 'confrontation and challenge candidate' after the FPM and opposition reached an agreement on his name. Bassil called for greater flexibility from Amal and Hezbollah, urging them to build consensus with other parties, including the Lebanese Forces (LF). The LF has yet to officially nominate a candidate, though its leader, Samir Geagea, has expressed a willingness to consider supporting Aoun if Hezbollah and Amal formally endorse him. Geagea, who has previously hinted at running for president himself, remains undecided. Aoun has received backing from several factions, including the Kataeb party, independent MPs, and the Democratic Gathering bloc of the Progressive Socialist Party (PSP). However, Hezbollah and Amal remain hesitant to support his candidacy. Reports suggest that their preferred candidate will not be announced until the voting session. While Hezbollah has reportedly vetoed Geagea, they have not ruled out Aoun. Meanwhile, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a key Hezbollah ally, has opposed any constitutional amendments that might facilitate Aoun's election. The Lebanese constitution states that presidential candidates must not have held high public office within the past two years, a provision that could disqualify Aoun. If elected, Aoun would become Lebanon's fifth army commander to assume the presidency and the fourth consecutive one to do so.The post Bassil declares votes for Aoun as spoiled first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/bassil-votes-aoun-spoiled/	2025-01-08T06:38:21-08:00	
Hochstein confirms Israeli forces start Naqoura pullout	U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein announced that Israeli forces began withdrawing from a border town in southern Lebanon on Monday, marking another step in the ongoing ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. This withdrawal, the second since the ceasefire began on November 27, follows calls from United Nations peacekeepers and Lebanon’s prime minister for Israel to expedite its exit from southern Lebanon. Hochstein confirmed that Israeli troops have started pulling back from Naqoura, a town near the U.N.-demarcated Blue Line, and returning to Israeli territory. He emphasized that the withdrawals would continue until all Israeli forces leave Lebanon, while the Lebanese Army takes over security responsibilities in coordination with U.N. peacekeepers. Following meetings with Speaker Nabih Berri and caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati, Hochstein expressed confidence that all parties would uphold their commitments to the ceasefire agreement, despite mutual accusations from Israel and Hezbollah of violating the terms. However, he did not confirm whether the withdrawal would be completed within the 60-day timeframe stipulated in the ceasefire. Hochstein noted that there are still 20 days left in the ceasefire period and pledged to continue efforts to ensure the withdrawal and deployment process remains on track. The agreement, which Hochstein helped negotiate, requires the Lebanese Army and United Nations peacekeepers to deploy in southern Lebanon as Israeli forces withdraw. Hezbollah is also obligated to move its forces north of the Litani River and dismantle any remaining military infrastructure in the area. Prime Minister Mikati reiterated the need for a clear timeline to complete the withdrawal by the deadline, rejecting any notion of extending the ceasefire period. The Lebanese Army confirmed its deployment around Naqoura in coordination with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) as Israeli troops vacated the area. The withdrawal and deployment coincided with a meeting of the five-member committee overseeing the ceasefire, which includes representatives from Israel, Lebanon, France, the United States, and UNIFIL. Hochstein co-chaired the meeting alongside U.S. Major General Jasper Jeffers, stating that the mechanism for managing the ceasefire is functioning effectively. While progress may not have been as swift as some had hoped, Hochstein expressed optimism after observing developments in Naqoura. Tensions remain, however, with Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz accusing Hezbollah of failing to comply with the ceasefire terms, including withdrawing north of the Litani River. Hezbollah has similarly accused Israel of violations. Earlier in December, the Lebanese Army deployed around Khiam following an Israeli troop withdrawal, marking the first such transition under the ceasefire agreement. During his visit, Hochstein also addressed Lebanon’s political situation, urging leaders to reach a consensus ahead of an upcoming presidential election. Lebanon has been without a president for over two years due to political divisions between Hezbollah and its rivals. Hochstein emphasized the importance of unity to implement reforms, rebuild the economy, and attract investment, presenting the moment as a critical opportunity for the Lebanese people. Hochstein and Jeffers also met with Lebanese Army Commander Joseph Aoun to discuss the ceasefire. Aoun, whose name has been mentioned as a potential presidential candidate, remains a key figure in the country’s security and political landscape.The post Hochstein confirms Israeli forces start Naqoura pullout first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hochstein-confirms-israeli-forces-naqoura-pullout/	2025-01-07T11:24:13-08:00	
Jumblat backs Aoun, rejects peace with Israel	Druze leader Walid Jumblat reaffirmed his support for Army Commander General Joseph Aoun as his bloc's candidate for Lebanon's presidency, noting that the nomination has received favorable responses from the five-nation group focused on Lebanon's situation. Jumblat emphasized the urgency of electing a president in the first round, warning against delaying the election until after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. He argued that postponement could lead to uncertainty, which the country cannot afford. He stated that General Aoun’s candidacy represents an opportunity, and if his election fails, there is no viable alternative. Commenting on the recent Israeli conflict with Lebanon, Jumblat acknowledged that Hezbollah was not defeated and expressed respect for the martyrs. However, he pointed out internal challenges within Hezbollah and urged acceptance of the new realities. He rejected recent remarks by Hezbollah figures Sheikh Naim Qassem and Wafiq Safa, instead advocating for strengthening and fortifying the state. Jumblat suggested that Hezbollah fighters could be integrated into the Lebanese army. Jumblat also expressed concerns about ongoing Israeli violations, suggesting that Israel might aim to create a new buffer zone in southern Lebanon. He highlighted the importance of leveraging the presence of U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, warning of Israel’s ambitions, particularly regarding the Litani River’s waters. He acknowledged Iran’s continued support for Hezbollah, providing available resources, but noted that these capabilities are no match for U.S. technology. Despite this, Jumblat reiterated his firm stance against peace with Israel, stating his opposition both now and for future generations. Jumblat revealed that he had previously urged Hezbollah, through messages, to avoid involvement in the conflict. While there is currently no contact with Wafiq Safa, Jumblat mentioned he is open to meeting him and noted no ongoing relationship with Sheikh Naim Qassem. The Druze leader called on Hezbollah to transition into a political party, stressing that Lebanon has endured enough wars and must prioritize stability for the benefit of future generations.

US and French generals inspect 5th Brigade ops in the south	U.S. Major General Jasper Jeffers, Chairman of the Cessation of Hostilities Implementation Mechanism, accompanied by French Brigadier General Guillaume Ponchin, visited the headquarters of the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) 5th Brigade in southwest Lebanon on Tuesday morning, according to a statement from the U.S. Embassy. The 5th Brigade's headquarters is located approximately five kilometers northeast of Naqoura, a town recently placed under LAF control following the initial phase of the Israeli forces' withdrawal on January 6. As part of the transition facilitated by the Mechanism, the LAF promptly deployed troops to the region to secure the area, clear roads, remove unauthorized munitions, and ensure the safety of the local population, the Embassy’s statement detailed. During their visit, Generals Jeffers and Ponchin inspected stockpiles of weapons confiscated from unauthorized armed groups, which are scheduled to be destroyed in the coming days. Major General Jeffers praised the efforts of the LAF, emphasizing their role as Lebanon’s legitimate security force. He highlighted the LAF's demonstrated capability, intent, and leadership in maintaining the country's security and defending its people. He specifically commended the swift and professional actions of the LAF, noting the expertise displayed by the soldiers of the 5th Brigade. He lauded the engineer corps, which safely removes and neutralizes hundreds of unexploded ordnance pieces each week, showcasing their dedication and professionalism in ensuring the safety of the region.The post US and French generals inspect 5th Brigade ops in the south first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-french-generals-inspect-5th-brigade-ops-south/	2025-01-07T11:23:30-08:00	
Israel Accuses Hamas of Withholding Hostage Status Despite Readin...	Israel announced on Monday that Hamas had not yet confirmed the status of 34 hostages the group had previously indicated it was willing to release as part of a potential exchange deal. Qatar, Egypt, and the United States have been involved in months-long efforts to broker a deal to end the war in Gaza. However, both sides have accused each other of obstructing the negotiations. In recent days, indirect talks between Israel and Hamas have resumed, even as Israeli forces continue their attacks on Gaza. According to a statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, Israel has yet to receive confirmation from Hamas regarding the status of the 34 hostages the group expressed readiness to free. The list of hostages was initially provided by Israel to the mediators in July 2024, not by Hamas. A senior Hamas official confirmed late on Sunday that the group had agreed to release 34 Israeli prisoners, as part of the first phase of a proposed prisoner exchange. The official stated that the swap would include women, children, the elderly, and the sick, but Hamas required additional time to assess the condition of the hostages. Hamas also mentioned that it would take a week of calm to determine which captives were alive and which were dead. The official added that Hamas would release the hostages, whether they were alive or dead. The war in Gaza began after a large-scale attack by Palestinian militants on October 7, 2023, which led to the capture of 251 Israeli hostages, with 96 still in Gaza. Israel's military reports that 34 of these hostages have died. On Monday, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum called for a comprehensive agreement to secure the release of the hostages, emphasizing that more than half of them are still alive and need immediate care. They also urged for the return of those who were killed for proper burial. There was a brief truce in November 2023 that saw 80 Israeli hostages freed in exchange for 240 Palestinians released from Israeli prisons. As of now, neither Israel nor Hamas has provided detailed information about the ongoing negotiations in Doha. However, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz confirmed on Saturday that talks were taking place. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed optimism about a potential ceasefire deal, though he suggested it might only come after President Joe Biden leaves office on January 20. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on the same date, has promised stronger support for Israel and warned Hamas of severe consequences if the hostages are not released. The situation remains tense, with Israeli airstrikes continuing to target Gaza. The latest strikes, including one that killed at least 11 people in northern Gaza, have escalated the death toll, with Israeli military actions having claimed the lives of 45,805 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to local health officials. The war began after the October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, which left 1,208 people dead, mostly civilians.The post Israel Accuses Hamas of Withholding Hostage Status Despite Readiness to Free Them first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-hamas-withholding-hostage-status/	2025-01-06T05:36:56-08:00	
Hochstein Arrives in Beirut Amid Shaky Truce Deal	U.S. special envoy Amos Hochstein arrived in Beirut on Monday amid a fragile truce between Lebanon and Israel, which began on November 27. On Sunday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz warned that no agreement would be reached unless Hezbollah withdrew beyond the Litani River. Meanwhile, Hezbollah’s new leader, Sheikh Naim Qassem, expressed concerns that the group's patience with Israeli violations might run out before the ceasefire's 60-day period ends. Israeli state media reported that Israeli forces would not withdraw from southern Lebanon when the 60-day ceasefire period concludes. Hochstein, who had spent over a year facilitating shuttle diplomacy to secure the ceasefire, now co-chairs a U.S.-led monitoring committee with representatives from France, the U.N. peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon, as well as Lebanon and Israel. MTV reported that Hochstein is expected to propose extending the ceasefire period by an additional 60 days. He will also caution Lebanese officials that the monitoring committee could intervene to disarm Hezbollah in southern Lebanon if the Lebanese army does not deploy ten thousand soldiers south of the Litani River. Furthermore, Hochstein is expected to address the issue of Lebanon's presidential election with key Lebanese figures, advocating for the election of Army Chief Gen. Joseph Aoun. MTV also mentioned that Hochstein would link Aoun’s election to the ceasefire’s continuation and Lebanon's reconstruction efforts. Hezbollah’s Coordination and Liaison Unit head, Wafiq Safa, stated on Sunday that his group does not have a veto over Aoun's election, only against Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea. Safa also emphasized that it is the Lebanese state's responsibility to address Israeli violations, with Speaker Nabih Berri planning to discuss these issues with Hochstein. Before arriving in Lebanon, Hochstein met with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan in Riyadh.The post Hochstein Arrives in Beirut Amid Shaky Truce Deal first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hochstein-arrives-beirut-shaky-truce-deal/	2025-01-06T05:36:46-08:00	
Israeli Army Intercepts Missile Fired from Yemen	On Sunday, the Israeli military reported that it had intercepted a missile launched from Yemen, marking the latest in a series of recent attacks. According to the military, the missile was intercepted before it could enter Israeli airspace after sirens sounded in the Talmei Elazar region. The missile was launched by Yemen's Houthi rebels, who control large parts of northern Yemen, including the capital, Sanaa. The Houthis stated that the missile was a hypersonic ballistic missile aimed at a power station located south of Haifa, Israel. Earlier in the week, on Friday, Israel's military also reported intercepting a missile and a drone launched from Yemen. These recent attacks come amid a broader escalation by Iran-backed groups, including Hezbollah, which has been involved in cross-border exchanges with Israel since the Hamas attack on October 7. The Houthis, like Hezbollah, have stated that their actions are in support of Palestinians and have pledged to continue their attacks until a ceasefire is achieved in Gaza. While most missiles and drones launched from Yemen have been intercepted, one missile did manage to strike Tel Aviv in December, injuring 16 people, according to Israel's military and emergency services. In retaliation, Israel has conducted airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen, including at Sanaa's international airport. In addition to missile attacks, the Houthis have targeted ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, disrupting vital shipping routes and prompting military responses from the United States and occasionally Britain. On Sunday, the Houthi news agency Saba and Al-Masirah TV reported airstrikes on locations east of Saada, a city in northern Yemen, attributing the attacks to the U.S. and the U.K. However, neither country provided an immediate comment on the report. The Iranian foreign ministry condemned the airstrikes carried out by the U.S. and U.K. against Houthi infrastructure in Saada province, with spokesperson Esmail Baghaei expressing strong disapproval.The post Israeli Army Intercepts Missile Fired from Yemen first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-army-intercepts-missile-yemen/	2025-01-05T06:38:09-08:00	
UN Accuses Israel of Ceasefire Violation as Hezbollah’s Patience ...	The U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon has accused Israel of a significant breach of the 2006 Security Council resolution, which is the foundation of the ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah that went into effect in November. This accusation from the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) comes as Hezbollah leader Sheikh Naim Qassem warned that the group's tolerance for Israeli violations could expire before the 60-day ceasefire period ends. The ceasefire, which began on November 27, has been marked by mutual claims of violations from both parties involved. The peacekeeping force reported that Israeli military bulldozers were seen destroying a blue barrel that marks the withdrawal line between Lebanon and Israel in Labbouneh, as well as an observation tower belonging to the Lebanese Armed Forces near a UNIFIL position. UNIFIL condemned the destruction of these identifiable properties, calling it a blatant violation of Resolution 1701 and international law. The peacekeeping force, which is part of the committee overseeing the ceasefire's implementation, urged all parties to avoid actions that could endanger the cessation of hostilities, including damaging civilian property and infrastructure. The terms of the ceasefire require the Lebanese Army to deploy alongside UNIFIL forces in southern Lebanon, while the Israeli army withdraws over a 60-day period. Hezbollah is also expected to pull its forces north of the Litani River, about 30 kilometers from the border, and dismantle any remaining military infrastructure in the south. In late December, UNIFIL expressed concern over the ongoing damage caused by Israeli military activities in southern Lebanon. In its recent operations, the Israeli military justified airstrikes as part of efforts to eliminate potential threats in line with the ceasefire arrangements. Qassem stated that Hezbollah has chosen to remain patient for now but warned that this patience is not unlimited. He clarified that the group is giving Israel an opportunity to prevent further violations and implement the agreement, but emphasized that Hezbollah's leadership will decide when to take action, respond, or shift tactics.The post UN Accuses Israel of Ceasefire Violation as Hezbollah’s Patience Wears Thin first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/un-israel-ceasefire-violation-hezbollahs-patience-thin/	2025-01-05T06:38:01-08:00	
Safa: No Veto on Army Chief, Only Geagea	Hezbollah's Coordination and Liaison Unit leader, Wafiq Safa, stated on Sunday that his group does not hold a 'veto' power over the potential election of Army chief Joseph Aoun as president. He clarified that the only veto held by Hezbollah concerns Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea, whom they consider a source of conflict and destruction for Lebanon. Safa also asserted that Hezbollah remains stronger than ever, with its capabilities fully restored. He emphasized the group's readiness to defend itself against any threats in a manner of its choosing, urging others not to challenge them. Regarding Israeli actions, Safa mentioned that Speaker Nabih Berri would engage in talks with U.S. mediator Amos Hochstein to address ongoing Israeli violations. When asked about Hezbollah's response if Israel fails to withdraw from Lebanon within the 60-day deadline, Safa noted that neither the Lebanese Army nor the monitoring committee has been updated on the situation. He emphasized that after the 60-day period, Hezbollah and the resistance would determine the next steps. Safa also referenced a statement by Sheikh Naim Qassem, asserting that the Lebanese government, which signed the agreement, is responsible for following up on ceasefire enforcement or violations.The post Safa: No Veto on Army Chief, Only Geagea first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/safa-no-veto-army-chief-only-geagea/	2025-01-05T06:37:52-08:00	
Katz: Ceasefire at Risk if Hezbollah Stays Near Litani	Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz issued a warning on Sunday, stating that if Hezbollah does not retreat beyond the Litani River, there will be no agreement, and Israel will have to take action. Katz emphasized Israel's commitment to ensuring the full implementation of the agreement in Lebanon, with a focus on safeguarding the return of residents in northern Israel. However, Katz made it clear that the key condition for the agreement's success is Hezbollah’s complete withdrawal from the area, the dismantling of their weapons, and the removal of terror infrastructure by the Lebanese Army, which has yet to occur. He further stated that if these conditions are not met, there will be no deal, and Israel will be forced to take independent measures to ensure the safe return of residents to their homes.The post Katz: Ceasefire at Risk if Hezbollah Stays Near Litani first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/katz-ceasefire-risk-hezbollah-litani/	2025-01-05T06:37:38-08:00	
Bassil Threatens Geagea Support If Hezbollah Backs Aoun	Jebran Bassil, the leader of the Free Patriotic Movement, has issued a warning to Hezbollah regarding its support for Army Chief Joseph Aoun in the presidential race, according to reports from local media outlet al-Jadeed. Bassil reportedly informed both Hezbollah and the Amal Movement that he would back Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea for the presidency, but only if they agree to support Aoun. Geagea had previously suggested he might run for president if he could garner sufficient political backing. Bassil, in an interview with al-Joumhouria, expressed his belief that Geagea has strong Christian support, making him a legitimate presidential candidate, and he would be willing to endorse him if he could help unite the Lebanese people. Bassil also mentioned he preferred Geagea over both Aoun and Hezbollah’s candidate, Marada leader Suleiman Franjieh. In an effort to end the political deadlock, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri has called for a parliamentary session on January 9 to elect a president. This move aims to break the two-year stalemate and revive Lebanon's struggling state institutions. It is reported that delegations from France, Saudi Arabia, and the United States, who are visiting Lebanon this week, will advocate for Aoun’s election. Lebanon has been without a president since Michel Aoun's term expired in October 2022. However, the two main political factions—Hezbollah and its opponents—have been unable to secure a majority or reach an agreement on a candidate. While Aoun is known to have good relationships with a range of political groups, including Hezbollah, he faces criticism from Hezbollah and its allies due to his ties with the United States, Lebanon’s key financial backer for the army. Aoun recently visited Saudi Arabia at the invitation of the Saudi King, and the presidential issue was reportedly discussed during the meetings. The United States, France, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt have all been working together for several months to help facilitate the election of a new Lebanese president.The post Bassil Threatens Geagea Support If Hezbollah Backs Aoun first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/bassil-threatens-geagea-support-hezbollah-aoun/	2025-01-02T06:35:34-08:00	
Israel Warns of Escalated Gaza Strikes	Israel has warned that it will increase its airstrikes on Gaza if Hamas continues to launch rocket attacks. On the first day of the New Year, Palestinian rescuers reported numerous casualties from Israeli strikes, which have been focused on northern Gaza where the Israeli military is conducting a major operation. Despite the recent rocket fire from Palestinian militants, which has been less frequent and less damaging than earlier in the conflict, it remains a political challenge for Israel, especially after nearly 15 months of fighting. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz issued a stern warning, stating that Hamas would face intensified strikes if it does not allow the release of Israeli hostages or stop targeting Israeli communities. As of now, Hamas still holds 96 hostages taken during their October 7, 2023 attack, and negotiations for their release or a ceasefire have not succeeded. Israeli military operations have continued across Gaza, with one recent strike in the town of Jabalia killing 15 people and injuring more than 20, according to Gaza's civil defense. The military claims it targeted Hamas militants in the area. The operations in northern Gaza, including the bombing of Jabalia and its refugee camp, are part of an effort to prevent Hamas from regrouping. However, the United Nations has raised concerns that the ongoing siege could lead to the permanent displacement of Gaza's population, potentially setting the stage for Gaza's annexation. The human toll of the conflict is severe, with entire families affected by the violence. A relative of victims in Jabalia described the strike as a massacre, with civilians, including children and women, killed while they slept. Many Gaza residents are now living in fear, not only due to the bombings but also the harsh winter conditions. Some have been unable to sleep for days due to the risk of illness or further missile strikes. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza is escalating, with ongoing reports of civilian casualties from Israeli bombings. UN aid officials describe widespread destruction and despair, as many people struggle to survive without adequate shelter or medical care. The Israeli military has also faced criticism for its claims that Hamas uses hospitals as military bases, an accusation that Hamas denies. As the conflict continues, the death toll in Gaza has reached at least 45,553 people, mostly civilians, while 1,208 people have been killed in Israel, according to official figures from both sides.The post Israel Warns of Escalated Gaza Strikes first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-warns-escalated-gaza-strikes/	2025-01-02T06:35:23-08:00	
Syrian Forces Sweep Homs in Major Security Operation	Syrian security forces are currently carrying out a large-scale operation in Homs city, according to state media reports. The operation, which is focused on two districts predominantly inhabited by the Alawite minority, follows an announcement from the Ministry of Interior and the Military Operations Department. The target of the operation is individuals involved in criminal activities who have refused to surrender their weapons and join settlement centers. The authorities are also searching for hidden arms and ammunition. A security official quoted by state news agency SANA stated that the operation is aimed at war criminals and those who have been involved in crimes. The operation follows earlier reports suggesting that remnants of Assad’s militias remain in parts of Homs, prompting the authorities to intensify their efforts. Since the overthrow of President Bashar al-Assad by Islamist-led rebels last month, a transitional government has been registering former soldiers and conscripts, asking them to relinquish their arms. Troops and armored forces have been deployed to search for individuals refusing to comply, particularly in Homs. A curfew has also been imposed in some parts of the city, and the Ministry of Interior has advised residents of certain neighborhoods to stay indoors and cooperate with security forces. A resident of one of the affected districts, Akrama, fled the area and reported heavy gunfire and the presence of military tanks. He mentioned that communications had been cut off, and there were reports of house searches and arrests of young men. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, stated that the two targeted districts, Wadi al-Dhahab and Akrama, are majority-Alawite, the sect to which the Assad family belongs. The ongoing operation is believed to be targeting former Shabiha militia members and individuals who were involved in pro-Assad demonstrations, which the new government viewed as a threat to its authority. Concerns over sectarian tensions have been raised, especially after protests broke out in Syria on December 25 following a video showing an attack on an Alawite shrine in the north. Although the ministry has stated that the video is old, activists have criticized the security sweeps, warning against actions that could exacerbate sectarian divisions and violate people's rights. Alawites, who have long been associated with the Assad regime, fear backlash due to their community's ties to the former president. The new leadership in Syria has sought to reassure minorities that they will be protected. However, tensions remain high, as evidenced by recent clashes in the Alawite-majority province of Tartus, where several security personnel were killed.The post Syrian Forces Sweep Homs in Major Security Operation first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/syrian-forces-sweep-homs-security-operation/	2025-01-02T06:35:12-08:00	
French Ministers Hold Talks with Berri in Ain el-Tineh	On Thursday, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri held a meeting with France's Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, who had arrived in Lebanon on Monday. Barrot's visit follows a fragile truce that has been in place since late November, bringing an end to the intense conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.

The French officials also visited U.N. peacekeepers stationed near the Israeli border in southern Lebanon on Tuesday. The discussions focused on enhancing cooperation between the Lebanese and French military forces, as well as continuing support for the Lebanese army under the current circumstances. Lecornu announced on social media that he would also be meeting with a French general who represents Paris in the ceasefire monitoring mechanism. This monitoring group includes representatives from Lebanon, Israel, the United States, France, and the United Nations' UNIFIL peacekeeping mission. Its purpose is to oversee the ceasefire's implementation and assess any potential violations.The post French Ministers Hold Talks with Berri in Ain el-Tineh first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/french-ministers-talks-berri-ain-el-tineh/	2025-01-02T06:35:02-08:00	
Israel Blames ‘Discipline Lapse’ in Death of Archaeologist Crossi...	The Israeli military has attributed the death of a 70-year-old archaeologist and another soldier in southern Lebanon to 'operational burnout' and a 'weakening of discipline and safety' during a visit to a combat zone in November. Zeev Erlich, who was not on active duty at the time, was wearing a military uniform and carrying a weapon when he was shot. Although he was not actively serving, the army classified him as a reservist with the rank of major and referred to him as a 'fallen soldier.' Erlich was a well-known figure in the West Bank, recognized for his work in Jewish history. Reports suggested that he had entered Lebanon to explore an archaeological site. The family of the soldier killed alongside him has expressed frustration over the circumstances surrounding his death. Following the incident, the Israeli military launched an investigation, with a separate inquiry focusing on how Erlich was permitted to enter the combat zone. While the military stressed that the entry of civilians, who are not military contractors or journalists, into such areas is rare, there have been previous reports of Israeli civilians, particularly those in favor of a permanent Israeli presence in Gaza or Lebanon, accessing these regions.The post Israel Blames ‘Discipline Lapse’ in Death of Archaeologist Crossing into Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-discipline-lapse-death-archaeologist/	2025-01-01T07:00:07-08:00	
Iran Set for Nuclear Talks with Europe on January 13	Iran is scheduled to engage in nuclear discussions with France, Britain, and Germany on January 13 in Geneva, Switzerland, as reported by local media. Kazem Gharibabadi, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister for Legal and International Affairs, confirmed that these meetings are intended as 'consultations, not negotiations.' This upcoming round of talks follows a November 2024 meeting where tensions escalated after a European-backed resolution accused Iran of inadequate cooperation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog. In response, Tehran announced plans to install additional uranium-enriching centrifuges at its enrichment facilities. The United Nations' nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, has expressed concern over Iran's accelerated uranium enrichment, noting that Iran is 'dramatically' increasing its enrichment levels to up to 60% purity, which is closer to the approximately 90% purity required for weapons-grade uranium. In 2018, the United States withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement under President Donald Trump and reimposed stringent sanctions on Iran. This action prompted Tehran to violate the agreement's nuclear limits, including rebuilding stockpiles of enriched uranium, refining it to higher fissile purity, and installing advanced centrifuges to expedite production. Indirect talks between the Biden administration and Tehran to revive the pact have been unsuccessful. President Trump has indicated a willingness to negotiate, stating during his election campaign in September: 'We have to make a deal, because the consequences are impossible. We have to make a deal.' As the January 13 talks approach, the international community remains attentive to Iran's nuclear activities and its engagement with European powers, with hopes for a resolution that addresses proliferation concerns and regional stability.

Israel Strikes Hezbollah Arms Transfer in Southern Lebanon	The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have conducted airstrikes in southern Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah operatives involved in transferring weapons. The IDF released footage showing Hezbollah members moving arms in the region prior to the strikes. This action is part of Israel's ongoing efforts to enforce ceasefire agreements and prevent the smuggling of arms to Hezbollah. The IDF has previously targeted Hezbollah's weapon smuggling routes in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, aiming to disrupt arms transfers from Syria. The situation in southern Lebanon remains tense, with both Israel and Hezbollah accusing each other of ceasefire violations. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) has expressed concerns over the ongoing hostilities, urging both parties to adhere to the ceasefire and avoid further escalation. The IDF's recent actions underscore the complexities of maintaining peace in the region, highlighting the challenges in monitoring and enforcing ceasefire agreements. The international community continues to call for restraint and dialogue to prevent further violence and instability.The post Israel Strikes Hezbollah Arms Transfer in Southern Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-strikes-hezbollah-arms-transfer/	2025-01-01T06:59:51-08:00	
10 Dead, 30 Injured in New Orleans Vehicle Attack	A man with a clear intent to cause widespread destruction drove a pickup truck at high speed into a crowd of people celebrating New Year's Eve in New Orleans, leading to at least ten fatalities and leaving over 35 others injured. The incident took place around 3:15 am local time in the city's lively French Quarter, which was filled with revelers welcoming 2025. Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick stated that the driver appeared determined to run over as many people as possible. Additionally, the driver shot at police officers, injuring two of them, and was intent on causing as much harm as he could. The whereabouts and condition of the driver remain unknown at this time. While the attack is not officially categorized as a terrorist act, Superintendent Kirkpatrick emphasized the truck’s high speed and the deliberate nature of the incident. The FBI will now lead the investigation into the event. Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry described the attack as a 'horrific act of violence.' Eyewitnesses told CBS News that the truck drove through the crowd before the driver got out and began shooting at police officers. Witnesses Jim and Nicole Mowrer described seeing a white truck break through a barricade at high speed. Nicole Mowrer recounted hearing gunfire and seeing police rush toward the scene. After the shooting stopped, they stayed in a safe spot until it was secure, and when they emerged, they saw several victims who had been struck and tried to help them. The attack occurred just before New Orleans was set to host the Sugar Bowl, a major football game between the University of Georgia and Notre Dame. Despite heightened police presence in anticipation of large crowds for the celebrations, the city was rocked by the tragedy.The post 10 Dead, 30 Injured in New Orleans Vehicle Attack first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/10-dead-30-injured-new-orleans-vehicle-attack/	2025-01-01T06:59:40-08:00	
French Ministers Visit Lebanon for Talks Amid Israel-Hezbollah Tr...	France's Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot and Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu arrived in Lebanon on Monday, marking their visit after a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah brought an end to the intense fighting that had plagued the region since late November. During their visit, Barrot and Lecornu met with Lebanese army chief Joseph Aoun. The following day, they are scheduled to visit U.N. peacekeepers stationed near the Israeli border. According to a statement from the Lebanese army on social media, the discussions between Aoun and the French officials focused on strengthening cooperation between the two countries' armies and continuing support for the Lebanese army in light of the ongoing situation. Aoun, who is considered a potential candidate for Lebanon’s presidency, has been responsible for deploying troops in southern Lebanon since the ceasefire took effect on November 27. Lecornu stated on social media that he is also set to meet with a French general involved in the ceasefire monitoring mechanism. He emphasized France's ongoing commitment to the stability of Lebanon and the broader region. This monitoring body includes representatives from Lebanon, Israel, the United States, France, and the U.N.'s UNIFIL peacekeeping mission, and is tasked with overseeing the ceasefire's implementation and addressing any violations. The UNIFIL peacekeeping force expressed concern on Thursday over the ongoing destruction in southern Lebanon by the Israeli army, despite the ceasefire being in place. On Tuesday, Lecornu and Barrot are expected to meet with French troops serving in the UNIFIL mission in southern Lebanon.The post French Ministers Visit Lebanon for Talks Amid Israel-Hezbollah Truce first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/french-ministers-lebanon-talks-truce/	2024-12-31T09:57:56-08:00	
Hezbollah Warns Israel: Leave South Lebanon After 60 Days	Mahmoud Qmati, the deputy head of Hezbollah's political council, has issued a warning that Hezbollah will change its approach towards Israeli soldiers if they remain in Lebanon for more than 60 days, which marks the initial phase of a ceasefire agreed upon in late November. Qmati explained that Hezbollah has committed to a period of patience for 60 days, but after this time, Israeli forces will be viewed as occupying troops, and Hezbollah will take appropriate action. The ceasefire agreement, brokered by France and the United States, outlines a gradual withdrawal of both Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters from southern Lebanon over the 60-day period. However, since the ceasefire began, Israel has continued to carry out occasional airstrikes in Lebanon, and its troops have advanced instead of retreating, bulldozing villages and detonating explosives along the border. Qmati emphasized that there are red lines, including issues related to Hezbollah’s weapons and the funding for reconstruction efforts. He accused certain domestic figures of acting in Israel's interests and stressed that Hezbollah does not want aid tied to conditions that would undermine its resistance. He further warned that France and the U.S. must understand that Hezbollah will not tolerate violations of these red lines, and they are prepared to take any necessary action. He reiterated that Hezbollah would not accept the occupation of Lebanon's land. Hezbollah has been patient so far for the sake of its people and in keeping with its commitment to the mediators. However, Qmati made it clear that after the 60-day period, on day 61, Hezbollah will treat Israeli forces as occupiers and respond accordingly. He also stated that Hezbollah's resistance capabilities remain strong and that the group is not bound by the ceasefire if Israel does not fully honor it. He indicated that either both sides must commit to the ceasefire, or neither will. Qmati added that many supporters and residents who have returned to villages in southern Lebanon are now calling on Hezbollah to take action in response to Israeli violations. He noted that the patience displayed by Hezbollah so far was for the benefit of these people, but now they are demanding retaliation.The post Hezbollah Warns Israel: Leave South Lebanon After 60 Days first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-warns-israel-leave-south-lebanon-60-days/	2024-12-31T09:57:49-08:00	
Syria’s Leader: Elections Could Take Up to 4 Years	Syria's current de facto leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, stated that it could take up to four years to organize elections in Syria. He also plans to disband his Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which has led the insurgency and is now overseeing the new authority in the country. Al-Sharaa shared these insights during an interview with Saudi television channel Al-Arabiya, nearly a month after HTS successfully overthrew President Bashar al-Assad's regime, which had been in power for decades. This move marked the end of the civil war that had been raging in Syria since 2011. According to al-Sharaa, elections will require time due to the need for political dialogue among Syria’s various factions and the rewriting of the country’s constitution, which has been under the rule of the Assad family for over fifty years. He also mentioned that the country’s infrastructure, severely damaged by the war, must be rebuilt. Al-Sharaa emphasized that the opportunity Syria now faces is rare and could not be expected again soon. He expressed a desire for the new constitution to be stable and enduring. Until March 1, al-Sharaa will continue as Syria's de facto leader. On that date, Syria's various factions are scheduled to engage in political discussions to shape the country’s future and establish a transitional government. At that time, HTS plans to dissolve, following years of dominance as the primary rebel group controlling a strategic region in the northwest of Syria.The post Syria’s Leader: Elections Could Take Up to 4 Years first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/syrias-leader-election-take-4-years/	2024-12-30T08:51:46-08:00	
Diplomats from France, US, and Saudi Arabia to Visit Lebanon for ...	Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri has called for a parliamentary session on January 9 to elect a president, aiming to resolve the two-year deadlock and revive Lebanon’s struggling state institutions. The session will start with multiple rounds of voting, and Berri emphasized that the key objective is for parliament to elect a president and for members to take responsibility. French Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Noël Barrot and Minister of the French Armed Forces Sébastien Lecornu are scheduled to visit Lebanon on Monday. They are expected to pressure Lebanese leaders to resolve the ongoing presidential crisis. Additionally, U.S. mediator Amos Hochstein and Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan are expected to arrive in Lebanon in early January to discuss the presidential election. Hochstein will meet with Berri and caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati, as well as discuss the ceasefire agreement reached with Israel in late November, according to local media reports. Pro-Hezbollah newspaper al-Akhbar reported that the French, Saudi, and U.S. delegations will likely push for the election of Army chief Gen. Joseph Aoun. Since Michel Aoun's term ended in October 2022, Lebanon has been without a president, with the two main political blocs—Hezbollah and its rivals—unable to reach a consensus or secure the necessary majority for election.The post Diplomats from France, US, and Saudi Arabia to Visit Lebanon for Presidential Talks first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/diplomats-france-us-saudi-arabia-lebanon/	2024-12-30T08:51:36-08:00

He described this establishment as consisting of Hezbollah, its allies, and the Free Patriotic Movement. Despite the emerging differences among the key factions within the establishment, Geagea pointed out that these groups are once again aligning with one another. The disagreements are secondary to their primary concern: their own survival and interests. Geagea also mentioned that the establishment is working discreetly to secure a new president, but they can no longer achieve the kind of leadership they originally desired. He noted that the political climate, both within the Arab world and internationally, is no longer in the establishment's favor, with external parties closely monitoring their actions.

Ukraine FM Calls for Expulsion of Russian Forces During Syria Vis...	Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga made an unannounced visit to Damascus on Monday, urging Syria's new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa to expel Russian forces from the country. Russia had been a crucial ally of former president Bashar al-Assad, intervening in 2015 to help reverse the tide of Syria’s civil war in Assad’s favor. The overthrow of Assad was a significant blow to Russia, which has since launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Currently, Russia is focused on securing its naval base in Tartus and its air base at Hmeimim, both on Syria's Mediterranean coast, as these are Moscow’s only military installations outside the former Soviet Union. Sybiga stated that both the Russian and Assad regimes relied on violence and torture to maintain control, and he emphasized that removing Russian influence from Syria would benefit not only Syria’s stability but also the broader Middle East and Africa. Sybiga also expressed Ukraine’s willingness to restore relations with Syria, which had soured when Assad recognized Russia's annexation of Ukrainian territories. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Ukraine had sent its first shipment of aid to Syria—a 500-tonne delivery of wheat flour—despite the ongoing war in Ukraine, highlighting Ukraine’s position as one of the world's leading wheat producers. Meanwhile, rebels led by Sharaa's Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), launched an offensive on November 27, quickly capturing several key cities before seizing the capital, Damascus, on December 8, forcing Assad to flee to Russia. Despite Russia’s continued support for Assad, Sharaa emphasized the deep strategic interests between Russia and Syria in an interview with Al-Arabiya TV, stating that Syria’s arms are all of Russian origin and many power plants are operated by Russian experts. He expressed opposition to the idea of Russia withdrawing from Syria in the manner some might hope for.The post Ukraine FM Calls for Expulsion of Russian Forces During Syria Visit first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/ukraine-fm-expulsion-russian-forces-syria-visit/	2024-12-30T08:51:21-08:00	
Russia Claims Ukrainian Drones Target Grozny as Azerbaijani Jet L...	Recommend tags for this article. The head of Russia's civil aviation agency stated on Friday that Ukrainian drones were targeting Grozny while an Azerbaijani Airlines plane was attempting to land there, before the plane later crashed in Kazakhstan. Dmitry Yadrov shared on Telegram that heavy fog had blanketed Grozny when the incident took place on Wednesday, creating 'very complicated' conditions around the airport at the time.Yadrov noted that Ukrainian military drones were carrying out attacks on civilian infrastructure during the event, and the plane had attempted to land twice unsuccessfully. The pilot was then offered the option to land at alternative airports, ultimately choosing to divert to Aktau Airport in Kazakhstan.Additionally, Yadrov mentioned that Grozny Airport had halted both arrivals and departures due to the drone attacks, though he did not specify when this occurred. The Azerbaijan Airlines plane eventually crashed in western Kazakhstan, resulting in the deaths of 38 out of the 67 people on board. Several media outlets have cited Azerbaijani officials suggesting that a Russian air defense missile might have caused the crash. The Kremlin has refrained from commenting on the situation, awaiting the conclusion of the official investigation.

China and Iran FMs: Mideast Shouldn’t Be Big Power Battleground	The foreign ministers of China and Iran agreed on Saturday that the Middle East should not be a region for external geopolitical competition or conflict among major powers. They emphasized that the region must not become a battleground for nations outside the Middle East. Abbas Araghchi, Iran's new foreign minister, is on his first official visit to China. During his discussions with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the two diplomats highlighted the need for international respect for the sovereignty, stability, unity, and territorial integrity of Middle Eastern countries. Both ministers called for a ceasefire in Gaza, the proper enforcement of the ceasefire in Lebanon, and the advancement of efforts related to counter-terrorism, reconciliation, and humanitarian aid in Syria. They agreed that the Middle East belongs to its own people and should not be subject to the geopolitical interests and conflicts of external powers. China and Iran have both supported Syria's former president Bashar al-Assad, although the new Syrian leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, opposes Iran’s influence. In addition to regional issues, the two diplomats discussed Iran's nuclear program, which has raised concerns, particularly from the United States and the UK, regarding potential weapons development. Tensions surrounding Iran's nuclear activities escalated after former President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from a key agreement that had placed limits on Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. Wang reaffirmed China's support for Iran's position on the matter, emphasizing that Beijing stands by Iran in protecting its legitimate rights and interests. As Iran’s largest trading partner, China is also a major buyer of Iranian oil, despite sanctions.The post China and Iran FMs: Mideast Shouldn’t Be Big Power Battleground first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/china-iran-mideast-shouldnt-battleground/	2024-12-29T06:11:13-08:00	
Assad Relatives Arrested Attempting to Flee Lebanon	On Friday, the wife and daughter of one of deposed Syrian president Bashar Assad's cousins were apprehended at Beirut airport for attempting to leave with allegedly forged passports, according to Lebanese judicial and security sources. Assad's uncle had departed the day before without issue. Rasha Khazem, wife of Duraid Assad (son of Rifaat Assad, Bashar's uncle), and their daughter, Shams, were caught trying to fly to Egypt after being smuggled into Lebanon illegally. The two are now being held by Lebanese General Security. Rifaat Assad, known for his brutal past, left the country a day earlier with his real passport, and no issues were reported at the time. Swiss prosecutors had indicted Rifaat Assad earlier in the year for war crimes and crimes against humanity related to his role in the Hama massacre, where thousands of Syrians were killed under his command, earning him the infamous title of the 'Butcher of Hama.' In addition, Lebanese authorities have detained over 20 former members of Syria’s 4th Division, military intelligence officers, and others linked to Assad's regime, many of whom were arrested while attempting to sell weapons in Lebanon. Meanwhile, Lebanon's public prosecution office received an Interpol alert regarding Jamil al-Hassan, the former head of Syrian intelligence. Lebanese officials have confirmed their intent to cooperate with the request to arrest al-Hassan.The post Assad Relatives Arrested Attempting to Flee Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/assad-relatives-arrested-flee-lebanon/	2024-12-29T06:11:06-08:00	
Breaking: Plane Explodes After Skidding Off Runway in South Korea...	A passenger plane caught fire on Sunday after it skidded off a runway at an airport in South Korea, crashing into a concrete wall. The incident, caused by a possible failure of the plane’s front landing gear, resulted in the deaths of most of the 181 people onboard, making it one of the deadliest aviation disasters in South Korean history. The crash occurred at the Muan airport, located about 290 kilometers south of Seoul. The plane, a 15-year-old Boeing 737-800, was returning from Bangkok when the accident happened at 9:03 a.m. According to the National Fire Agency, at least 176 people, including 83 women and 82 men, were confirmed dead in the ensuing fire. Two crew members were rescued and are reportedly in stable condition. Three individuals were still missing after several hours of rescue operations. Rescuers, including 1,560 firefighters, police, and soldiers, worked tirelessly to contain the blaze and assist survivors. Emergency crews deployed 32 fire trucks and helicopters to help with the operation. Footage of the crash showed the plane sliding across the runway, apparently with its landing gear still retracted. After overrunning the runway, it collided with a concrete wall, sparking a massive explosion. The fire chief at Muan airport stated that the plane was completely destroyed, leaving only the tail section intact. Investigations are ongoing to determine the cause of the crash, with initial theories including a potential bird strike. Authorities noted that the control tower had issued a bird strike warning shortly before the incident. They also confirmed that the pilot had issued a distress signal before the crash. Flight data and cockpit voice recorders from the plane have been recovered and will be analyzed as part of the investigation. The Muan airport runway has been closed until January 1 for further examination. The passengers included two Thai nationals, and Thailand’s prime minister expressed condolences and pledged assistance to the victims' families. Jeju Air, the airline operating the flight, offered a deep apology and vowed to manage the aftermath of the tragedy. In a public statement, the airline's president took full responsibility for the crash, stating that no mechanical issues had been reported following the aircraft’s regular maintenance. The crash is one of the worst in South Korea’s aviation history, rivaling previous disasters such as the 1997 Korean Air crash that killed 228 people and the 2013 Asiana Airlines accident in San Francisco. Internationally, it is one of the worst landing accidents in recent years. As the nation grapples with this tragedy, it is also in the midst of a political crisis, with the president facing impeachment and martial law. The crisis added another layer of complexity to the emergency response, with senior government officials coordinating efforts to address the disaster.The post Breaking: Plane Explodes After Skidding Off Runway in South Korea, 176 Dead first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/plane-explodes-skidding-runway-south-korea/	2024-12-29T06:10:58-08:00	
Syrian Embassy Suspends Services as Lebanon Hands Over Assad Offi...	Syria's embassy in Lebanon halted its consular services on Saturday, just one day after two relatives of former Syrian President Bashar Assad were arrested at Beirut airport with suspected fake passports. On the same day, Lebanese authorities deported dozens of Syrians, including former Syrian army officers who had served under Assad, back to the new Syrian authorities after they were caught illegally entering Lebanon. This information was confirmed by both a war monitor and Lebanese officials. The embassy announced on its Facebook page that consular services were suspended 'until further notice,' following an order from the Syrian foreign ministry. However, the embassy did not provide a reason for the suspension. According to two Lebanese security officials, who asked to remain anonymous, the decision was made because the passports belonging to Assad's relatives—his cousin’s wife and daughter—were believed to have been forged at the embassy. It was noted that Assad’s uncle, Rifaat Assad, who faces war crimes and crimes against humanity charges in Switzerland, had departed on his valid passport the day before without issue. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that 70 Syrians, including former officers from Assad’s army, were handed over to the new Syrian authorities, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). Three Lebanese judicial officials confirmed this information, speaking on condition of anonymity. Meanwhile, countries in the region have been quick to engage with Syria's new leadership, with official visits from delegations from Libya and Bahrain arriving in Damascus on Saturday. HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, has worked to ease fears that his group would punish communities supporting Assad’s rule or impose strict Islamic law on religious minorities in Syria. However, tensions remain, with sporadic clashes erupting between HTS-led forces and pro-Assad groups. The new Syrian security forces have raided areas and set up checkpoints in regions populated by the Alawite minority, which Assad belongs to, to search for weapons. There are also ongoing conflicts between Kurdish-led forces in northeastern Syria and armed groups backed by Turkey. Many Kurds are uneasy about the new Syrian order, which they feel strengthens Turkey’s position in the region. Ankara views the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF)—a key ally of the U.S. in fighting ISIS—as linked to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which it considers a terrorist organization. The U.S. State Department reported that Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan on Saturday to discuss developments in Syria. Blinken emphasized the importance of supporting a Syrian-led political process that respects human rights and promotes an inclusive government, and both sides agreed on the shared goal of preventing terrorism from destabilizing both Syria and Turkey. On the same day, hundreds of protesters organized by Kurdish women's groups took part in a demonstration in Hasaka, a city in northeastern Syria, calling for women's rights in the new political order. Perishan Ramadan, a protester from Hasaka, expressed her concerns, stating that the new government is even worse than Bashar Assad’s regime and accusing its leaders of being Islamist extremists who reject any role for women in society. While the new leaders have yet to impose Islamic dress codes or other restrictions, there is uncertainty about what role women will play in the new system, including whether they will hold political positions. Rihan Loqo, a spokeswoman for the Kongra Star women's organization, stressed the importance of ensuring that women's rights are included in Syria’s new constitution, asserting that their rights must not be overlooked.The post Syrian Embassy Suspends Services as Lebanon Hands Over Assad Officers first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/syrian-embassy-suspends-services-lebanon-assad-officers/	2024-12-29T06:10:50-08:00	
Arab League Urges Iran to Avoid Fanning Syria’s Strife	The Arab League has urged Iran to refrain from inciting unrest in Syria following the collapse of President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Assad, who had ruled for decades with the backing of Iran, was overthrown on December 8 after an Islamist-led coalition seized control of key cities and advanced to Damascus, forcing him to flee to Russia. This marked a significant loss for Iran, which had relied on Assad as an ally, especially as its Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah, also faced setbacks after a year of conflict with Israel. Despite welcoming Assad back into the Arab League after a decade of isolation, the organization emphasized the importance of respecting Syria’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and stability. It called for disarming all non-state groups and rejecting foreign interventions that destabilize the country. The League expressed concern over recent events in Syria, where clashes between government forces and remnants of Assad’s loyalists have erupted. In response, Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, predicted the rise of a strong group in Syria, suggesting the country's youth, with little to lose, would play a key role. Tehran’s foreign ministry rejected claims of interference in Syria’s internal affairs, asserting its commitment to Syria’s territorial integrity and a unified political system. Syria’s new leadership has criticized Iran’s involvement in the country, urging Tehran to respect Syria’s sovereignty and warning against actions that could lead to further chaos.The post Arab League Urges Iran to Avoid Fanning Syria’s Strife first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/arab-league-iran-avoid-fanning-syrias-strife/	2024-12-28T02:27:08-08:00	
Jumblat Urges Security Agencies to Wake Up	Lebanese Druze leader Walid Jumblatt has called on the country's security agencies to intensify their efforts in apprehending former regime officials who are reportedly fleeing the country. In a post on the X platform, Jumblatt noted that while the Lebanese Foreign Ministry has recently engaged with Syria's new administration, the security agencies have yet to take action against these individuals. He questioned whether the security forces could 'wake up' and arrest the senior officials who are crossing the border and fleeing through the airport.

Hochstein Set to Reject Iran’s Role in Lebanon Reconstruction	U.S. mediator Amos Hochstein is poised to deliver a firm message to Lebanese officials, asserting that Iran will not be permitted to participate in Lebanon's reconstruction efforts. This stance aims to prevent Iranian influence from infiltrating the rebuilding process, particularly through financial channels that could potentially support Hezbollah. Hochstein's upcoming visit underscores the United States' commitment to ensuring that Lebanon's reconstruction is managed exclusively by the Lebanese government, free from external interference. The U.S. is determined to prevent any Iranian involvement, whether through direct aid or the engagement of Iranian companies, to maintain the integrity of the reconstruction process. This development follows a recent U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, which has significantly altered the regional dynamics. The ceasefire terms require Hezbollah to withdraw heavy weaponry from southern Lebanon, with an American monitoring mechanism to enforce this. However, doubts remain about the ceasefire’s durability due to past enforcement failures of similar agreements. The Lebanese government now faces the critical task of navigating these geopolitical pressures while striving to rebuild the nation. The exclusion of Iran from the reconstruction process is expected to have significant implications for Lebanon's political landscape and its relationships with neighboring countries.

Iran FM Warns Against Interference in Syria’s Future	Iran's foreign minister warned on Friday against any 'destructive interference' in Syria's future, emphasizing that the decisions regarding the country's future should be made solely by its people. Abbas Araghchi, who arrived in Beijing on Friday for his first official visit to China as foreign minister, made the remarks in an article published in the Chinese state media. Both China and Iran have been supporters of the Syrian regime under Bashar al-Assad, who was forced to flee Syria this month after an Islamist-led offensive resulted in the loss of several key cities, including Damascus on December 8. In his article in People's Daily, Araghchi stated that Iran believes it is up to the Syrian people to decide their future, without any external interference or imposition. He reaffirmed Iran's commitment to Syria's sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a strong ally of Assad's regime, expressed confidence on Sunday that a 'strong, honorable group' would rise to oppose the instability in Syria. Khamenei emphasized that Syria's youth would resist those responsible for the chaos and, with determination, overcome the challenges. Araghchi, in his article, highlighted that supporting the Syrian people is a fundamental principle that all international parties should keep in mind. China, which also maintains a close relationship with Assad, has expressed its support for the Syrian people and opposes any forces exploiting the situation to sow further chaos. In 2023, Assad met with Chinese President Xi Jinping, and the two leaders announced a strategic partnership between their countries. During his two-day visit, Araghchi is expected to hold talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. China is Iran's largest trade partner and a key purchaser of its sanctioned oil. Xi Jinping had previously pledged to strengthen ties with Iran during a meeting with Iranian officials in Russia in October. Araghchi described his visit as timely, given the current tensions in the region and international issues, including the ongoing nuclear discussions. He mentioned that both countries share a common viewpoint that calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza should be a top priority in the Middle East.The post Iran FM Warns Against Interference in Syria’s Future first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/iran-fm-warns-interference-syrias-future/	2024-12-27T05:45:13-08:00	
US Presses Israel to End Violations and Withdraw from Lebanon	The United States has intensified its diplomatic efforts, urging Israel to cease its military operations in southern Lebanon and to fully withdraw its forces, as stipulated in the recent ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah. This call comes amid reports of Israeli incursions into southern Lebanon, raising concerns about the implementation of the ceasefire terms. Israeli forces have reportedly advanced into areas beyond the agreed-upon limits, with incursions reaching up to 8 kilometers north of the UN-designated Blue Line. This escalation has led to increased tensions and displacement of local residents. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which includes 380 Irish soldiers, has expressed deep concern over these developments, highlighting the ongoing destruction of residential and agricultural areas. UNIFIL has called for the immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces and adherence to UN Resolution 1701, which mandates a phased Israeli military pullout and the repositioning of Hezbollah fighters. In response to these violations, the U.S. has emphasized the importance of Israel's compliance with the ceasefire agreement. The U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) reported that Israeli forces conducted a withdrawal from a town in southern Lebanon, with the Lebanese military replacing them under the terms of the ceasefire. The U.S. administration has underscored that the future of Syria should be determined solely by its people, free from external interference. This stance aligns with Iran's position, as expressed by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi during his visit to Beijing. Araghchi emphasized Iran's respect for Syria's unity, national sovereignty, and territorial integrity, advocating for decisions to be made by the Syrian people without foreign imposition. The situation remains fluid, with international stakeholders closely monitoring the developments to ensure the full implementation of the ceasefire and the withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon.

Israel Strikes ‘Infrastructure’ on Syria-Lebanon Border	On December 27, 2024, the Israeli military conducted airstrikes targeting infrastructure along the Syria-Lebanon border, specifically near the village of Janta in Lebanon's Beqaa Valley. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) stated that these strikes aimed to dismantle infrastructure utilized by Hezbollah for weapon transfers. The IDF emphasized that Hezbollah exploits civilian infrastructure for terrorist activities and weapon smuggling intended for attacks against Israeli citizens. The military asserted its commitment to removing any threats to Israel in accordance with the understandings outlined in the ceasefire agreement. This military action follows a recent statement from the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which expressed concern over the ongoing destruction by the Israeli military despite a truce agreement with Hezbollah. UNIFIL has called for the withdrawal of Israeli forces and adherence to UN Resolution 1701, which mandates a phased Israeli military pullout and the repositioning of Hezbollah fighters. The situation remains tense, with the IDF asserting its right to defend Israeli citizens and UNIFIL urging compliance with international resolutions to maintain stability in the region.

Houthis Claim Fresh Attacks on Israel After Yemen Airport Strikes	Yemeni rebels, led by the Houthi movement, claimed responsibility for a missile strike on Israel's Ben Gurion airport and drone attacks on Tel Aviv and a ship in the Arabian Sea, following Israeli airstrikes on rebel-held areas in Yemen. These attacks come after a series of airstrikes by Israel, including a raid on Sanaa's international airport, as tensions between Israel and the Houthis escalate. The Israeli strikes, which targeted military sites, power stations, and ports in Yemen's rebel-controlled territories, followed a missile attack from the Houthis. Israel’s military stated the strikes were aimed at disrupting Houthi military infrastructure and halting Iranian weapons smuggling into the region. The United Nations voiced concern over the escalation, with Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemning the attacks on vital infrastructure, which threaten Yemen's already fragile humanitarian operations. UN Chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who had been in Yemen to negotiate the release of detained UN staff, narrowly escaped injury when the Sanaa airport came under bombardment. The Houthis have intensified their attacks against Israel since late November, and their missile and drone assaults have been aimed at Israeli cities and shipping routes in the Red Sea. Israel has retaliated with airstrikes targeting Houthi-controlled regions, including strategic sites in Sanaa and Hodeida, vital for the entry of humanitarian aid. The conflict has been marked by growing tensions between Israel, Yemen’s Houthis, and Iran, which supports the rebel group in their fight against Saudi-led forces in Yemen.The post Houthis Claim Fresh Attacks on Israel After Yemen Airport Strikes first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/houthis-attacks-israel-yemen-airport-strikes/	2024-12-27T05:44:50-08:00	
Mikati Denies Lebanon Was Told Israel Won’t Withdraw After 60 Day...	On Friday, Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati rejected claims from media reports suggesting that Lebanon had been indirectly informed that Israel would not pull out of southern Lebanon after the 60-day period outlined in the ceasefire agreement. Mikati's office described these reports as 'completely unfounded' and emphasized that the prime minister had urged both the U.S. and France to pressure Israel to withdraw from Lebanese territory and end its ongoing violations. Israeli military sources had informed Haaretz newspaper that the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) might need to remain in Lebanon until the Lebanese army fulfills its obligations under the ceasefire agreement, which includes assuming full control of southern Lebanon. The ceasefire agreement, brokered by the U.S. and other nations, has been in effect for 30 days as of Thursday. Haaretz reported that during this period, the IDF had killed 44 Hezbollah militants in strikes related to violations of the ceasefire. The IDF had responded to 25 of the 120 violations by Hezbollah. At present, the IDF is satisfied with the ceasefire's implementation, coordinated with the Lebanese army, and with U.S. involvement in its enforcement. The Israeli military maintains its presence in all Lebanese villages near the border fence, preventing residents from returning. Additionally, the IDF has begun constructing outposts along the northern border, some of which will be located in Israeli-controlled enclaves. Despite this, these outposts do not cross the international border between Israel and Lebanon. The Israeli military estimates that Hezbollah has lost 30% of its manpower and 75% of its firepower since the conflict began, though the group still possesses hundreds of short- and long-range rockets.The post Mikati Denies Lebanon Was Told Israel Won’t Withdraw After 60 Days first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/mikati-denies-lebanon-israel-wont-withdraw/	2024-12-27T05:44:39-08:00	
Watch: Priest with Machine Gun in Church Sparks Outrage in Lebano...	كاهن مزرعة يشوع يدخل الى صلاة العيد حاملاً سلاح حربي pic.twitter.com/AqlZOSNsY1 &mdash; مصدر مسؤول (@fouadkhreiss) December 25, 2024 A video showing a priest with a machine gun slung over his shoulder inside a church in Lebanon’s Mazraat Yachouh has sparked widespread attention and controversy on social media. The Maronite Diocese of Antelias condemned the priest’s actions, clarifying that the stunt, which was not sanctioned by the church, was part of a sermon aimed at emphasizing that 'a believer’s weapon is the cross.' According to a statement from the diocese, the priest placed the weapon in front of the congregation and urged them to abandon all forms of violence that harm others, encouraging them to embrace the cross as the only true weapon—symbolizing love and forgiveness. While the diocese expressed approval of the sermon’s message, which aligns with the church’s teachings, it distanced itself from the method used by the priest. The church issued a written warning, requesting that such actions not be repeated. The diocese also emphasized the importance of preventing the incident from being seen through a sectarian lens and hoped it would not be used to fuel division or resentment, particularly given the current tensions in the country.The post Watch: Priest with Machine Gun in Church Sparks Outrage in Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/priest-machine-gun-church-outrage-lebanon/	2024-12-26T06:34:20-08:00	
Israeli Strike Kills 5 Palestinian Journalists in Gaza	An Israeli airstrike overnight in the Gaza Strip killed five Palestinian journalists outside a hospital, according to the Health Ministry. The attack targeted a car near the Al-Awda Hospital in the Nuseirat refugee camp, located in central Gaza. The journalists were working for the Quds News Network, which also confirmed the strike. The Israeli military stated that it was targeting a group of militants from Islamic Jihad, a group affiliated with Hamas, which launched the October 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, sparking the ongoing conflict. The Committee to Protect Journalists reported that more than 130 Palestinian reporters have been killed since the war began. Israel has restricted access to Gaza for foreign journalists, allowing only military embeds. The conflict started when Hamas militants breached the border in a surprise assault, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking approximately 250 hostages. As of now, about 100 hostages remain in Gaza, with at least a third feared dead. Israel's ongoing air and ground offensive has claimed the lives of more than 45,000 Palestinians, with the Health Ministry stating that over half of the casualties are women and children. The military actions have caused widespread devastation, displacing about 90% of Gaza's population, which totals 2.3 million. Many have sought refuge in overcrowded tent camps along the coast, struggling to endure the harsh winter conditions.The post Israeli Strike Kills 5 Palestinian Journalists in Gaza first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strike-kills-5-palestinian-journalists-gaza/	2024-12-26T06:34:12-08:00	
UNIFIL Condemns Israel’s Destruction of Homes, Infrastructure in ...	The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) issued a warning on Thursday, emphasizing the importance of halting any actions that could jeopardize the fragile ceasefire in southern Lebanon. The organization reiterated that both Israel and Lebanon had committed to fully implementing Security Council resolution 1701 and encouraged both sides to use the newly-established Mechanism to resolve any remaining issues. UNIFIL called for the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) to withdraw from southern Lebanon and for the Lebanese Armed Forces to deploy in the area as part of the full implementation of resolution 1701, which aims to pave the way for peace. The peacekeeping force emphasized that it would continue to support both countries in fulfilling their obligations and monitoring progress. This includes ensuring the area south of the Litani River remains free of armed personnel and weapons, except for those of the Lebanese government and UNIFIL, and upholding respect for the Blue Line. The statement also expressed concern over ongoing destruction caused by Israeli forces in southern Lebanon, including damage to residential areas, farmland, and infrastructure, which it deemed a violation of resolution 1701. UNIFIL peacekeepers will persist in their duties to monitor and report violations of the resolution to the Security Council. A truce between Israel and Hezbollah went into effect on November 27, following an escalation of violence in the region. Since then, both sides have accused each other of violating the ceasefire. The ceasefire agreement stipulated that UNIFIL and the Lebanese Army would redeploy in southern Lebanon, with Israeli forces pulling back over a period of 60 days. The resolution calls for the withdrawal of Israeli troops and the establishment of Lebanese and UNIFIL forces as the only military presence in the area, where Hezbollah holds significant influence. Earlier this week, UNIFIL had urged quicker progress regarding the Israeli military's withdrawal. Meanwhile, Lebanon's National News Agency reported continued Israeli military activities in southern Lebanon, including an incursion into the town of Qantara, which led to residents fleeing to nearby villages. Additionally, Israeli aircraft struck the eastern Baalbek region, far from the border, on Wednesday.The post UNIFIL Condemns Israel’s Destruction of Homes, Infrastructure in South Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/unifil-israels-destruction-homes-infrastructure/	2024-12-26T06:34:01-08:00	
Israeli Army Raids Wadi al-Hujeir, Detains Citizen, Forces Evacua...	On Thursday, Israeli forces violated the ceasefire agreement by entering southern areas including al-Qantara, Adsheet al-Qusayr, and Wadi al-Hujeir, according to the Lebanese Army. The army accused Israel of continuing to breach the ceasefire, undermining Lebanon’s sovereignty, and causing destruction in southern towns and villages. In response, the Lebanese Army increased its presence in the affected areas and continued to monitor the situation in coordination with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and the five-party ceasefire monitoring committee. Israeli forces, advancing in the region, used heavy machine guns and forced residents of al-Qantara to flee to nearby towns like al-Ghandouriyeh and Srifa. Additionally, Israeli forces abducted Lebanese citizen Hossam Fawwaz while he was on his way to work at the UNIFIL Indonesian contingent in Adsheet al-Qusayr. Fawwaz was later released and handed over to UNIFIL and the Lebanese Red Cross, who transported him to receive treatment for a gunshot wound to his head. These incidents led the Lebanese Army to block the road between its post in Qaaqaaiyet al-Jisr and Wadi al-Hujeir, while Israeli Merkava tanks patrolled the valley, accompanied by Israeli machinegun fire. The Majdal Selm Municipality also advised locals to avoid the Slouqi-Hujeir road towards Nabatieh and its surrounding sideroads. Later, a UNIFIL patrol visited the al-Qantara intersection, where Israeli forces were present. The National News Agency reported that Israeli bulldozers were constructing dirt barriers to block the road connecting Wadi Slouqi to Wadi al-Hujeir. In response to these actions, Hezbollah’s Caretaker Labor Minister Mustafa Bayram called for a 'historic lesson' and declared that resistance remains the only viable solution. Hezbollah lawmaker Ali Fayyad condemned the Israeli incursion, labeling it 'extremely dangerous' and a serious threat to the implementation of UN Resolution 1701.The post Israeli Army Raids Wadi al-Hujeir, Detains Citizen, Forces Evacuations first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-army-raids-wadi-al-hujeir-detains-citizen/	2024-12-26T06:33:52-08:00	
Report: Israeli Army Plans Extended Stay in Lebanon Beyond Ceasef...	According to sources within the Israeli military, the Israeli army has stated that it will need to remain in Lebanon until the Lebanese army can fully take control of southern Lebanon, as stipulated by the terms of the ceasefire agreement. This agreement, which was brokered by the U.S. and other nations, came into effect 30 days ago, marking a month since the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. During this period, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) reported that 44 Hezbollah militants were killed in strikes by the IDF for violating the ceasefire. Of the 120 violations recorded, the army launched attacks in response to 25 of them. Currently, the IDF is satisfied with the implementation of the agreement, noting that it has been carried out in cooperation with the Lebanese army and with support from the United States. The Israeli army remains stationed in all Lebanese villages near the border, where residents have not yet been allowed to return. Additionally, the IDF has begun constructing outposts along the northern border, some of which will be positioned in Israeli-controlled areas beyond the border fence. These outposts will not cross the international boundary between Israel and Lebanon, although in certain areas considered vulnerable, the outposts will be located in enclaves beyond the border. The Israeli military believes that Hezbollah has suffered significant losses during the conflict, with an estimated 30% of its manpower and 75% of its firepower destroyed since October 6, 2023. Despite these losses, the defense establishment assesses that Hezbollah still possesses hundreds of short-range rockets and long-range missiles.The post Report: Israeli Army Plans Extended Stay in Lebanon Beyond Ceasefire Terms first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-army-extended-stay-lebanon/	2024-12-26T06:33:42-08:00	
Pakistani Airstrikes Kill 46 in Afghanistan	Airstrikes conducted by Pakistan in Afghanistan's eastern Paktika province have resulted in the deaths of 46 people, according to a spokesperson for the Taliban government. The Pakistani attacks are the latest escalation in the ongoing tensions at the border, which have been rising since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 2021. Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban spokesman, reported that the airstrikes hit four areas in the Barmal district on Tuesday. The majority of those killed were women and children, and six others were injured, also mostly children. The Taliban condemned the airstrikes, calling them 'barbaric' and an act of 'clear aggression.' They stated that they would not let this act go unanswered and emphasized their right to defend Afghan territory and sovereignty. These strikes follow previous clashes at the border, including deadly airstrikes in March by Pakistan that the Taliban said killed eight civilians. Maleel, a local resident of Barmal, reported that one family lost 18 members when a bombardment struck their home, while another attack killed three people in a nearby house. The victims were mostly local residents and others who had fled from Waziristan in Pakistan. The Barmal district borders North Waziristan, an area long associated with militancy. Pakistan had launched a military offensive in this region, along with U.S. drone strikes, during the post-9/11 occupation of Afghanistan. The recent airstrike comes after the Pakistani Taliban (TTP), which shares an ideology with the Afghan Taliban, claimed responsibility for an attack on a Pakistani army outpost last week, killing 16 soldiers. Pakistan has expressed concerns about the Taliban providing sanctuary to TTP fighters, accusing them of launching attacks on Pakistani territory without facing repercussions. The Taliban, however, denies these claims and has promised to expel foreign militant groups. A July U.N. Security Council report estimated that as many as 6,500 TTP fighters are based in Afghanistan, with the Taliban not considering them a terrorist group. This growing violence has further strained relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan. In response to security concerns, Pakistan recently initiated a campaign to expel undocumented Afghan migrants. There has been no official comment from Pakistan regarding the latest airstrike. Meanwhile, high-ranking Taliban officials were meeting with Pakistan’s special envoy for Afghanistan in Kabul on the same day the airstrikes occurred.The post Pakistani Airstrikes Kill 46 in Afghanistan first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/pakistani-airstrikes-kill-46-afghanistan/	2024-12-25T11:13:59-08:00	
Syrians Protest Attack on Alawite Shrine After Shocking Video	Protests erupted across several regions of Syria on Wednesday after a video emerged showing an attack on an Alawite shrine in northern Syria, according to witnesses and a war monitor. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that large demonstrations took place in the coastal cities of Tartus and Latakia, which are home to the Alawite minority, the sect to which former president Bashar al-Assad belongs. Protests were also reported in parts of the central city of Homs and other areas, including Qardaha, Assad's hometown. Witnesses informed AFP that protests took place in Tartus, Latakia, and nearby Jableh, with images from Jableh showing large crowds in the streets chanting slogans such as 'Alawite, Sunni, we want peace.' In response to the unrest, the state news agency SANA reported that authorities in central Homs imposed a curfew from 6:00 pm to 8:00 am, and a similar nighttime curfew was announced in Jableh. The protests followed the circulation of a video earlier that day showing an attack on a significant Alawite shrine in Aleppo's Maysaloon district. The video claimed that five workers were killed in the attack and the shrine was set on fire. Syrian authorities have dismissed the video as 'old,' claiming it showed an incident from earlier in the month when Islamist-led rebels captured northern Aleppo. An interior ministry statement noted that the video was being republished to 'stir up strife' during a sensitive time for the country. Bashar al-Assad has long portrayed himself as the protector of Syria’s minority groups, particularly the Alawites, in a nation dominated by Sunni Muslims.The post Syrians Protest Attack on Alawite Shrine After Shocking Video first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/syrians-protest-attack-alawite-shrine/	2024-12-25T11:13:49-08:00
