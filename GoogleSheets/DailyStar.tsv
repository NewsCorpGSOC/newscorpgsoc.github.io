Trump urges Israel to maintain calm in Lebanon and Syria	According to the report from Channel 12, Israel, a source there said that Donald Trump associates told top officials in Israel that President-elect Trump wants stability in the Middle East so that he can focus more on the needs inside his own nation. The new Trump administration's incoming representatives conveyed their desire to maintain peace in Lebanon and Syria, as evidenced by their statement, 'The president-elect does not want to encounter a new war during the initial days of his tenure.'. Furthermore, the senior officials have counselled Israel to avoid bellicose statements against the new Syrian leadership to prevent the situation from deteriorating in the region. They said that Syria's newly installed leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, has no interest in conflict with Israel at this point in time. A similar message has been conveyed about Lebanon, where the team of Trump is said to be eager for the current ceasefire to remain in place. They have mentioned that the president-elect is keen on not letting the military conflicts resume on Israel's northern border.The post Trump urges Israel to maintain calm in Lebanon and Syria first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/trump-urges-israel-maintain-calm-lebanon-syria/	2025-01-13T06:32:27-08:00	
Breakthrough in Israel-Hamas ceasefire and hostage release talks	Diplomatic efforts to reach a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war and the release of hostages in Gaza have gained significant momentum, officials say, but no deal has been inked yet. Talks brokered by U.S. and Arab mediators have neared an imminent potential agreement, though crucial differences remain. The coming days will be crucial, officials said, to end over 15 months of fighting that has caused anarchy in the Middle East. In an overnight breakthrough, mediators presented a proposed agreement to both sides. Negotiators from Israel and Hamas will now seek approval from their respective leaders. Pressure has been building from mediators, including Qatari officials pressing Hamas to accept the terms and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, weighing in with Israeli representatives. The next 24 hours are going to be pivotal in finalizing the draft agreement. The tentative plan reportedly includes a phased ceasefire: first, the partial release of hostages by Hamas in return for a temporary stoppage of the fighting; the broader ceasefire and other terms would be taken care of by the additional negotiations. Hamas has insisted on a complete end to the conflict and an Israeli withdrawal, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remains committed to continuing military operations until a decisive victory over Hamas is achieved. The agreement had faced months of stalemates in U.S.-led negotiations, which included Egypt and Qatar, with significant disagreements over a hostage prisoner exchange and over what exactly would comprise the cease-fire. The Biden Administration, eager for a finalized deal before President Biden leaves office, has pressed efforts to close outstanding gaps on hostage releases. The agreement has been in the making from US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Middle East envoy Brett McGurk, with Israeli intelligence chief David Barnea in Doha. Officials say they are optimistic, but much work remains, and time is short before the January 20 presidential inauguration. At the same time, the ground Palestinians in Gaza believe nothing is possible and that peace would not return soon. This war has dislocated 90% of its people, and numerous losses have occurred due to massive death tolls. The families of the hostages in Israel still demand the underneath the situation of safe circumstances and encouraging Netanyahu to get this done. This protracted conflict has caused immense human suffering, with over 46,000 Palestinians killed, mostly women and children, and significant casualties in Israel during the initial Hamas attack. Both sides are under mounting pressure to bring an end to the violence and establish a path toward resolution.The post Breakthrough in Israel-Hamas ceasefire and hostage release talks first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/breakthrough-israel-hamas-ceasefire/	2025-01-13T06:32:15-08:00	
Iran and EU powers to hold nuclear talks ahead of Trump return	Iran will engage in talks over its nuclear program with major European powers-France, the UK, and Germany-in Geneva on January 13. There is hope, amid these ongoing discussions, of solving concerns against Iran's nuclear policy and sanctions being enforced once again. This comes days before Donald Trump resurfaces at the helm in the U.S., a situation where tensions seem to be in an all-time high and every decision about Iran by him seems controversial. The JCPOA 2015 was a historical agreement whereby Iran agreed to cap its nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. However, in 2018, President Trump withdrew the U.S. from the deal, reinstating strict sanctions on Iran. In reaction, Iran gradually decreased its compliance with the agreement, escalating uranium enrichment activities. This can be seen to be the renewed efforts by European nations to address these issues in diplomatic talks, to not let things go further. European leaders are increasingly concerned about Iran's developing nuclear capabilities. French President Emmanuel Macron recently said that Iran's nuclear program is at a 'critical point,' and he urged the European partners to consider reinstating sanctions if Iran does not begin to make progress. The Geneva talks aim to find a diplomatic solution to reinstate some limitations on Iran's nuclear activities while providing economic relief that Iran is seeking. Iran's Stand and Expectations Iran had maintained it was a civilian program and asked for relief in place of the sanctions that badly hit the country's economy. Before the negotiations, Iran's foreign ministry had stressed the issue of removal of sanctions and offered an ear to concerns presented by the European parties. But Iran called on France to reverse its 'unconstructive' approach after comments from French officials on the possible reimposition of sanctions. Implications of Trump's Return The return of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency makes the negotiations even more complicated. Trump's previous 'maximum pressure' campaign increased tensions between the U.S. and Iran. European diplomats are aware that time is running out to achieve a diplomatic breakthrough before potential policy shifts under the new U.S. administration. The outcome of the Geneva talks could influence future U.S. strategies and the overall stability of the Middle East. The Geneva talks between Iran and European powers are at the critical juncture where addressing the problems created by Iran's nuclear program is crucial. In the setting of Donald Trump's return to the U.S. presidency, there is increased pressure for a peaceful resolution. The international community goes through a wait-and-see process in hopes that the dialogue will be productive, stabilizing the region and stopping the ongoing proliferation of nuclear arms.The post Iran and EU powers to hold nuclear talks ahead of Trump return first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/iran-eu-powers-hold-nuclear-talks-trump-return/	2025-01-13T06:32:07-08:00	
President Joseph Aoun begins consultations to name PM	**President Joseph Aoun Starts Consultations to Name New Prime Minister President Joseph Aoun has started consultations with parliamentary blocs and independent MPs with the aim of naming a new prime minister. This is very significant for Lebanon while it grapples with economic and political crises, for which strong leadership in governance is needed to put the country on the path of stability. The political scenario in Lebanon has been turbulent, replete with economic difficulties and public dissatisfaction. The last government had the onus for its inability to apply vital reforms and stabilize the economy, for which it came under unrelenting attacks. Given the current parliamentary makeup, consensus needs to be reached on a prime minister with whom different political blocs can come together and form an active government. President Aoun has reiterated that the new government should be in the interest of the nation and cater to the essential needs of Lebanese citizens. The consultations are meant to propose a candidate who can bring about consensus among the divided political and sectarian factions of the country. Key Stakeholders and Political Dynamics These consultations with President Aoun involve those heads of big political parties, independent Members of Parliament, and even those from the minorities. That has to ensure participation at any length and gets their varied ideas about the qualifications, priorities entailing the new Prime Minister. The process, according to analysts, would likely zero in on the individual who, until now, demonstrates some record in terms of reforms or anyone who should trust the nation on restoring foreign partners. The new prime minister will now have to take on Lebanon's spiraling economic crisis, the recovery from recent conflicts, and much-needed reforms. International observers and Lebanese citizens alike will be closely watching the process, hoping for a leader who can restore stability and confidence in the country's governance. As the consultations unfold, President Aoun will announce his decision in the coming days. This is going to be the capable government which is very important for Lebanon's future, especially at a time when the country is seeking international support and funding for recovery. It is also a moment of hope for Lebanese citizens, who wish this moment would usher in a better future for the country.The post President Joseph Aoun begins consultations to name PM first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/president-joseph-aoun-consultations-name-pm/	2025-01-13T06:31:58-08:00	
Netanyahu dispatches Mossad chief to Gaza ceasefire talks	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has taken a decisive step in addressing the escalating conflict in Gaza by sending Mossad chief David Barnea to participate in ceasefire negotiations. This move highlights the urgency and gravity of the situation, as violence continues to impact both Israeli and Palestinian civilians. The ongoing conflict has seen heightened tensions and significant casualties on both sides, prompting international calls for de-escalation. With Israel’s military operations intensifying in response to persistent rocket fire from Gaza, the need for a sustainable ceasefire has become more pressing. Netanyahu’s decision to involve Mossad, typically associated with intelligence and covert operations, underscores the complex dynamics at play in reaching a peaceful resolution. Barnea’s participation in the talks signals Israel’s intention to prioritize security concerns while exploring avenues for diplomacy. While details of the negotiations remain undisclosed, reports suggest that the focus will be on achieving an immediate halt to hostilities, addressing humanitarian challenges in Gaza, and setting the groundwork for longer-term stability in the region. The decision to involve Mossad reflects Netanyahu’s recognition of the multi-faceted nature of the conflict. Intelligence plays a critical role in understanding and countering security threats, and the agency’s involvement may provide unique insights that could facilitate the ceasefire process. These negotiations come amid heightened international scrutiny. Countries around the world, including the United States, Egypt, and Qatar, have called for restraint and are urging both parties to prioritize diplomacy. The involvement of global mediators may increase the chances of reaching a viable agreement, although challenges remain in bridging the deep-rooted mistrust between the parties. As talks progress, the focus will likely shift toward balancing Israel’s security interests with the need to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The outcomes of these negotiations will not only influence immediate peace efforts but could also set the tone for future discussions on long-term solutions to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.The post Netanyahu dispatches Mossad chief to Gaza ceasefire talks first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/netanyahu-mossad-chief-gaza-ceasefire-talks/	2025-01-12T09:47:54-08:00	
Israeli army reports four soldiers killed in north Gaza	The Israeli Defense Forces have announced that four soldiers have been killed in fighting in the northern Gaza Strip. The overall number of Israeli military deaths has risen to 403 since ground operations began in Gaza, launched in response to Hamas's October 7, 2023, attacks. The soldiers were involved in combat at the time of their death. During that exchange, one officer and a reservist soldier sustained critical injuries. Both injured have since been evacuated to the hospital. IDF is investigating the details surrounding the incident. The IDF has continued its ground offensive in the Gaza Strip, targeting Hamas militants and infrastructure. The military claims to have killed more than 17,000 militants in the current conflict, though these numbers have not been independently verified. The situation remains extremely volatile, with heavy casualties on both sides. Simultaneous with the military action, diplomatic efforts are proceeding pari passu to establish a cease-fire. Mr. Netanyahu has sent Mossad Director David Barnea for indirect talks with Hamas in Qatar in the hope that there might be movement in negotiations. Brokered by the United States, Egypt, and Qatar, negotiations now focus on the phase-by-phase cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas. Humanitarian Impact The war has become a catastrophe for civilians in the region. The Gaza Health Ministry reports more than 46,000 Palestinian deaths, mostly women and children, since hostilities began. The humanitarian situation is worsening, with large-scale displacement and infrastructure destruction further increasing the misery of the civilian population. The killings of the four Israeli soldiers make quite clear the human cost of continued conflict in Gaza. As military operations continue alongside diplomatic negotiations, the international community looks on with high hopes for a resolution that can bring an end to hostilities and alleviate the humanitarian crisis affecting the region.The post Israeli army reports four soldiers killed in north Gaza first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-army-four-soldiers-killed-north-gaza/	2025-01-12T09:47:46-08:00	
UAE to reopen Beirut embassy after talks with Aoun	The United Arab Emirates will reopen its embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, in what would be a significant step toward healing two-way diplomatic relations. This move comes after a meeting between UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati in Abu Dhabi. Background of the Diplomatic Rift In October 2021, the UAE, along with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Bahrain, recalled its diplomats from Lebanon due to critical comments about the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen made by then-Lebanese Information Minister George Kordahi; the move had resulted in strained ties between Lebanon and several Gulf countries. Recent Developments and Agreements During their meeting, President Sheikh Mohamed and Prime Minister Mikati agreed on the measures required for reopening the UAE Embassy in Beirut, and the need to establish a joint committee entrusted with proposing a mechanism for facilitating entry procedures for Lebanese wishing to visit the UAE. His Highness Sheikh Mohamed hoped that Lebanon would enjoy stability, security, and prosperity and reiterated the UAE's steadfast stance regarding the unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Lebanon. The UAE has shown its support to the people of Lebanon for seeing an active Lebanon on the regional and international front and as a coherent and strong country. Implications for Bilateral Relations The reopening of the embassy and the facilitation of visa processes mark a positive shift in UAE-Lebanon relations. This means both parties are on the same page in their commitment to strengthen ties in various fields of development and economy for the service of both countries' interests. Prime Minister Mikati also thanked the UAE for its continued support, which he described as having had positive effects on the Lebanese people. The reopening of the UAE Embassy in Beirut represents a pivotal moment in restoring diplomatic relations between the UAE and Lebanon. This development is expected to enhance cooperation and foster stronger bilateral ties, contributing to regional stability and prosperity.The post UAE to reopen Beirut embassy after talks with Aoun first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/uae-reopen-beirut-embassy-talks-aoun/	2025-01-12T09:47:38-08:00	
Syria claims foiling Islamic State attack on Sayyida Zeinab shrin...	Syrian intelligence under the country’s new leadership has reportedly foiled a plot by the Islamic State (IS) to bomb the Shiite shrine of Sayyida Zeinab in a Damascus suburb. State media announced the arrests of individuals involved in the plan, attributing the information to an unnamed official from the General Intelligence Service. According to the official, the intelligence agency is fully committed to countering any threats targeting the diverse population of Syria. The Sayyida Zeinab shrine has previously been a target for IS attacks, as the group, adhering to an extreme interpretation of Sunni Islam, views Shiites as heretics. A notable attack occurred in 2023 when a motorcycle bomb exploded at the shrine, killing six people and injuring dozens on the eve of the Shiite holy day of Ashoura. The announcement of this foiled attack seems intended to reassure Syria’s religious minorities, many of whom supported the former government of Bashar al-Assad. Assad, an Alawite minority leader, was aligned with Iran, the Shiite Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, and Iraqi militias backed by Iran. The current de facto government, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), emerged as the ruling party after leading an offensive that overthrew Assad last month. Previously affiliated with al-Qaida, HTS is a Sunni Islamist group that has since severed those ties. Its leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, has emphasized the importance of religious coexistence since taking control in Damascus.The post Syria claims foiling Islamic State attack on Sayyida Zeinab shrine first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/syria-foiling-islamic-state-attack-zeinab-shrine/	2025-01-11T10:10:21-08:00	
Aoun urges swift government formation to set things right	President Joseph Aoun emphasized on Saturday that his mission is not centered around engaging in politics but on establishing a functional and equitable state. During a meeting with Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdul Latif Daryan in Baabda, Aoun highlighted that such a state can only thrive when built on fairness and equality among all its components, unified under a single national identity. He stressed that no group should emerge as a victor or a loser, citing the recent conflict between Israel and Hezbollah as a reminder that damage affects everyone. He expressed concern over the hardships endured by the Lebanese people, emphasizing that the nation has endured enough suffering. Aoun called for collective efforts, noting that this is a critical opportunity for the country to either succeed or fail, and success requires unity and cooperation. Aoun also underlined the urgency of forming a new government promptly to steer the country in the right direction and restore international trust. He urged the Lebanese to leverage foreign aid constructively rather than using it as a tool to intimidate one another. The president reiterated the importance of equality among all Lebanese citizens, stating that no sect or individual holds superiority over another. He emphasized unity under one flag and one national identity, declaring that while the right to hold differing opinions is fundamental, fostering disputes is unacceptable.The post Aoun urges swift government formation to set things right first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/aoun-swift-government-formation/	2025-01-11T10:10:14-08:00	
Los Angeles probes fire cause as curfew takes effect	Californians are demanding accountability for the destruction caused by the Los Angeles wildfires, as authorities enforce a strict nighttime curfew to prevent looting and chaos. The fires have claimed at least 11 lives, reduced thousands of homes to ash, and left many residents devastated, with President Joe Biden comparing the scene to a war zone. Frustration is mounting over the preparedness and response of officials, particularly regarding false evacuation alerts and a lack of water for firefighters during the critical early stages. Governor Gavin Newsom has called for an independent review of the city’s utilities, describing the water shortages as deeply concerning and demanding answers. Residents, like Pacific Palisades homeowner Nicole Perri, expressed anger, accusing officials of failing them. In Altadena, Nicholas Norman echoed similar sentiments, accusing authorities of abandoning ordinary people to their fate. Late Friday, a flare-up forced additional evacuations from high-profile neighborhoods, including areas near the Getty Center, which houses priceless art and was designed with fire-resistant materials. As the risk of looting grows, a curfew from sunset to sunrise has been implemented in affected areas. The Los Angeles Police Department has already made around two dozen arrests, and violators face penalties of up to six months in jail or $1,000 in fines. The National Guard has been called in to assist local law enforcement. The fires, spanning five separate blazes, have consumed more than 37,000 acres and destroyed approximately 10,000 buildings, according to California’s fire agency. Firefighters have been battling around the clock, with some progress reported. In Pacific Palisades and Malibu, the largest blaze is now 8% contained, while the Eaton Fire near Altadena is at 3% containment. A third fire near Hidden Hills, home to several celebrities, is 50% contained. Despite these gains, officials warn that the situation remains perilous, with strong winds expected to return in the coming days. Celebrities have also been affected by the devastation. Actor Mel Gibson revealed that his Malibu home was destroyed, describing the loss as heartbreaking. The causes of the fires are still under investigation. Meanwhile, Biden criticized misinformation being spread about the blazes, indirectly addressing incoming president Donald Trump. Governor Newsom, who has faced criticism from Trump, extended an invitation for the president-elect to visit Los Angeles and witness the destruction firsthand. Newsom called for unity, urging leaders to avoid politicizing the tragedy. Experts highlight the role of climate change in intensifying wildfire risks, with dry conditions following two wet years leaving large amounts of fuel ready to ignite. Additionally, emergency managers have faced backlash for mistakenly issuing false evacuation alerts to millions, causing widespread panic. Officials apologized for the error, with Los Angeles fire chief Kristin Crowley citing chronic understaffing and budget constraints as significant challenges. Despite the temporary lull in winds, the battle against the fires continues, and officials emphasize the need for vigilance as the region faces ongoing threats.The post Los Angeles probes fire cause as curfew takes effect first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/los-angeles-probes-fire-cause-curfew-effect/	2025-01-11T10:10:04-08:00	
Russia targets Libya as new Africa launchpad	The collapse of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria, a long-standing ally of Russia, has upended the Kremlin's strategy across the Mediterranean and Africa. This shift is forcing Moscow to redirect its focus toward Libya as a potential new stronghold, according to experts. Russia's military operations in the Mediterranean, Middle East, and sub-Saharan Africa relied heavily on its bases along the Syrian coast. With Assad’s sudden removal from power, this strategic setup faces significant disruption. Although Syria's new leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has signaled a desire to maintain relations with Russia, the political reshuffling in Syria is compelling Moscow to pivot its attention to Libya. In Libya, Russian mercenaries are already supporting Khalifa Haftar, who controls the country’s east, in opposition to the UN-recognized Government of National Unity (GNU) in Tripoli, which is backed by Turkey. This realignment is a defensive move to secure Russia's ongoing military and political operations in Africa, explained Jalel Harchaoui from the RUSI think tank in the UK. It reflects Russia’s effort to adapt to its declining influence in Syria. Russian activities in Libya have grown significantly. Reports from the investigative group 'All Eyes On Wagner' in May 2024 revealed Russian military operations at multiple Libyan sites, including the strategic port of Tobruk. By mid-2024, Russian troop numbers in Libya had nearly doubled, alongside reports of advanced military equipment being transferred from Syria, including S-300 and S-400 missile defense systems. Since Assad’s fall on December 8, there has been a marked increase in the movement of Russian troops and military resources into Libya. Ukrainian intelligence claims that Moscow is using cargo ships to transport arms and equipment into the region, further solidifying its presence. Libya is central to Russia’s strategy to maintain regional influence. Unlike Syria, which provided a stage for Moscow to test military capabilities and challenge NATO’s eastern flank, Libya offers an opportunity to disrupt Western interests and extend influence into Africa. This is particularly evident in Russia’s partnership with Haftar, who serves as a counterweight to the Tripoli-based GNU. However, Russia’s shift to Libya faces significant challenges. Unlike Syria, where Moscow operated with little scrutiny, Libya is more transparent, making it harder for Russian activities to remain concealed. Additionally, Russia must navigate the complex alliances of other influential players, including Turkey, Egypt, and the UAE, all of which are involved in Libya's fractured politics. Efforts to gain a permanent foothold in Tobruk’s port have drawn concern from the Tripoli government, Italy, NATO, and the EU. The United States has also reportedly pressured Haftar to deny Russia a lasting presence in the area. Despite these challenges, Russia appears determined to pursue its strategy in Libya, using it as a platform to project power across the region. However, experts warn that relying solely on Haftar could repeat the mistakes made in Syria, where Russia’s plans depended heavily on a single leader. As Russia seeks to solidify its position in Libya, it must balance its efforts with a broader contingency plan and navigate the delicate dynamics of Libya's divided political landscape. While Haftar values Russian support, he is unlikely to sever ties with Western allies completely, limiting Moscow's influence in the region.The post Russia targets Libya as new Africa launchpad first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/russia-targets-libya-new-africa-launchpad/	2025-01-11T10:09:52-08:00	
Cyprus president first foreign leader to meet Aoun	Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides has become the first foreign leader to officially visit Lebanon's newly elected President Joseph Aoun. The visit marks the first by a foreign head of state since Aoun, a former Lebanese army commander, was chosen by the Lebanese parliament to fill the presidency after a vacancy of more than two years. The two leaders held discussions at the presidential palace in Baabda, located southeast of Beirut. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Christodoulides emphasized Cyprus’s commitment to Lebanon, stating that his visit was a demonstration of support for Lebanon and its people through actions rather than words. Lebanon and Cyprus share a long history of close ties. Situated less than 200 kilometers apart, Cyprus has historically provided military aid to strengthen Lebanon’s armed forces and served as a refuge for thousands of Lebanese during the country’s civil war from 1975 to 1990. In more recent years, the economic collapse in Lebanon, which began in late 2019, prompted many Lebanese citizens to seek a new life in Cyprus. The two nations have also engaged in extensive discussions regarding border management. These talks have been particularly significant as many Syrian refugees in Lebanon, as well as an increasing number of Lebanese affected by the ongoing economic crisis, have attempted to reach Cyprus by sea aboard smuggler boats.The post Cyprus president first foreign leader to meet Aoun first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/cyprus-president-first-foreign-leader-meet-aoun/	2025-01-10T10:13:02-08:00	
Israeli drone strike kills 5, injures 4 in Tayr Debba	An Israeli drone targeted a van in the town of Tayr Debba in the Tyre district on Friday. According to the Health Ministry, the attack resulted in five fatalities and left four others injured. The Israeli military stated that the strike occurred after individuals were observed loading weapons into a vehicle linked to Hezbollah. The army claimed the operation was aimed at neutralizing the threat posed by the weapons. A fragile ceasefire has been in place since November 27, following over a year of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, which included two months of intense conflict with ground troop involvement. Under the terms of the truce, the Lebanese Army, alongside U.N. peacekeepers, is tasked with deploying in the south as the Israeli military withdraws over a 60-day period, set to conclude on January 26. Hezbollah is required to pull its forces north of the Litani River, approximately 30 kilometers from the border, and dismantle its remaining military infrastructure in southern Lebanon. The impending withdrawal deadline has sparked anxiety among many in Lebanon, who fear the potential for renewed violence. The Israeli military has repeatedly cautioned residents against returning to villages near the border. The U.N. migration agency recently reported that over 120,000 people remain displaced within Lebanon, while Israeli officials stated that around 51,000 people are displaced from northern Israel. Lebanese authorities estimate that since October 2023, more than 4,000 people have died as a result of the conflict, with the majority of fatalities occurring since September of last year, including some after the ceasefire. Both sides have accused each other of violating the agreement and have exchanged warnings in the aftermath of the truce.The post Israeli drone strike kills 5, injures 4 in Tayr Debba first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-drone-strike-kills-5-tayr-debba/	2025-01-10T10:12:53-08:00	
Aoun sets PM consultations for Monday	President Joseph Aoun has announced that binding parliamentary consultations to select a new prime minister will take place on Monday. According to a statement from the Presidency, Aoun will meet with parliamentary blocs and independent MPs from 8:00 a.m. until around 5:30 p.m. Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati has expressed his willingness to lead the next government, with reports indicating he will remain in his position until the upcoming parliamentary elections. Meanwhile, Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea has proposed MP Ashraf Rifi or MP Fouad Makhzoumi as potential candidates for the role. On Thursday, Lebanon's parliament elected Aoun as president, ending a more than two-year presidential vacancy. The vote follows a fragile ceasefire that concluded a 14-month conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. The new president is expected to play a crucial role in securing international aid for Lebanon's reconstruction efforts. Aoun, who is not related to former President Michel Aoun, is widely regarded as the favored candidate of the United States and Saudi Arabia, both of which are key to Lebanon’s plans for recovery and rebuilding. The next government will face significant challenges, including implementing the ceasefire agreement, overseeing reconstruction, and addressing the country's deep economic and financial crisis. Lebanon is now in its sixth year of an economic downturn that has severely devalued its currency and eroded the savings of its citizens. The state electricity company remains underfunded, providing only a few hours of power daily. In 2022, Lebanon reached a preliminary agreement with the International Monetary Fund for a bailout package, but progress on the required reforms to finalize the deal has been minimal.The post Aoun sets PM consultations for Monday first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/aoun-sets-pm-consultations-monday/	2025-01-10T10:12:42-08:00	
Israel targets Yemen Houthis, vows to hunt leaders	Israel conducted airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen on Friday, targeting a power station and coastal ports in retaliation for recent missile and drone attacks. The Israeli military stated that fighter jets hit multiple military sites controlled by the Houthis on Yemen’s western coast and inland regions. The strikes were carried out in response to Houthi-launched missiles and drones aimed at Israel. The military identified key targets, including military infrastructure at the Hizaz power station, a crucial energy source for the Houthis, and facilities in the ports of Hodeida and Ras Issa. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasized that the Houthis were being punished for their continued aggression. He stated that Israel is committed to ensuring the group faces significant consequences for their attacks. Defense Minister Israel Katz warned that Israel would actively pursue the leaders of the Houthi organization. He highlighted the damage inflicted on Houthi-held infrastructure, including paralyzing Hodeida port and setting Ras Issa port ablaze, asserting that no one involved would be immune from retaliation. The Houthis, who control Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, have been launching missiles and drones toward Israel since the outbreak of the Gaza conflict in October 2023. They describe these actions as expressions of solidarity with the people of Gaza. The Iran-backed group has also targeted ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, which has prompted retaliatory strikes by the United States and occasionally Britain. Israel has previously struck Houthi-controlled sites in Yemen, including locations in the capital. According to the Israeli military, the Houthis have launched approximately 40 surface-to-surface missiles toward Israel since the Gaza war began, most of which were intercepted. Additionally, around 320 drones have been launched, with Israeli air defenses intercepting over 100.The post Israel targets Yemen Houthis, vows to hunt leaders first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-targets-yemen-houthis-hunt-leaders/	2025-01-10T10:12:29-08:00	
Berri’s bloc leans toward backing Joseph Aoun	The Development and Liberation Bloc, led by Speaker Nabih Berri, appears to be leaning towards supporting Army Chief Joseph Aoun in Thursday’s presidential election, according to media reports on Wednesday. An-Nahar newspaper reported that the bloc is showing an inclination to back General Joseph Aoun. Meanwhile, sources from the bloc told LBCI television that their earlier statement reaffirmed a commitment to achieving consensus among Lebanese political factions. The sources indicated that if this consensus points toward electing the army commander, the bloc would support it. However, conflicting reports have emerged. Sky News Arabia cited sources suggesting that Berri has not yet provided a definitive response regarding his position or Hezbollah’s stance on Joseph Aoun’s candidacy. Similarly, Radio VDL News (93.3) quoted senior sources stating that claims about the Shiite Duo’s endorsement of Aoun are inaccurate. These sources argued that such reports are attempts to influence various parties and generate momentum around a potential presidential candidate.The post Berri’s bloc leans toward backing Joseph Aoun first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/berris-bloc-leans-backing-joseph-aoun/	2025-01-09T00:11:50-08:00	
US says Israel to withdraw in 15 days, retains strategic hills	According to al-Akhbar newspaper, U.S. mediator Amos Hochstein announced during the most recent ceasefire monitoring committee meeting that Israel would withdraw from south Lebanon's western, central, and eastern sectors within 15 days. The committee’s co-chair, U.S. General Jasper Jeffers, also approved an Israeli plan to maintain control over three strategic hills within Lebanese territory. Sources familiar with the plan revealed that the withdrawal would occur in three phases. During the first five days, Israeli forces would pull out from the western sector, spanning from Ras al-Naqoura to Rmeish. The next five days would see a withdrawal from the central sector, covering Rmeish to Mays al-Jabal. Finally, the eastern sector, from Mays al-Jabal to Shebaa, would be vacated in the last five days. Despite the withdrawal, Israel intends to establish military bases on three key hills within Lebanon, according to the report. These hills include the al-Labbouneh forest near Naqoura and Alma al-Shaab, the Blat mountain situated between Marwahin, Ramyeh, Beit Leef, and Qawzah, and the al-Hamamis hill between the plains of Khiam and al-Wazzani. The strategic locations of these hills allow Israel to monitor vast areas south of the Litani River. They overlook the Israeli settlements of Western Galilee, Zar’it, Shtula, and Metula. The uninhabited nature of these hills, which lack any structures, provides Israel with the ability to maneuver quickly into Lebanese territory if necessary, the sources added.The post US says Israel to withdraw in 15 days, retains strategic hills first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-israel-withdraw-15-days-retains-hills/	2025-01-09T00:11:42-08:00	
US redirects $100m military aid to Lebanon to support ceasefire	In its final days, the Biden administration has redirected over $100 million in military aid originally allocated to Israel and Egypt, shifting the funds to Lebanon to support a ceasefire agreement brokered between Israel and Hezbollah. According to State Department notifications sent to Congress on January 3 and later obtained by The Associated Press, $95 million intended for Egypt and $7.5 million earmarked for Israel will now aid Lebanon’s military and government. The majority of the redirected funds will support the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF), which play a critical role in implementing the November ceasefire agreement. The funding will help the LAF deploy to southern Lebanon, complementing the efforts of the U.N. peacekeeping mission patrolling the Blue Line, the border demarcation established after the 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. The State Department emphasized the importance of strengthening the LAF to ensure the success of the ceasefire and maintain Lebanon’s territorial integrity. Both Israel and Hezbollah have agreed to withdraw their forces from southern Lebanon by the end of January, with compliance overseen by the LAF and U.N. peacekeepers. The department highlighted that U.S. assistance enhances the LAF’s capacity as Lebanon’s only legitimate military force, helping it counter destabilizing threats from ISIS and other terrorist groups while providing security for Lebanese citizens and U.S. personnel. The notifications also addressed concerns from critics who allege Hezbollah’s influence within the LAF, stating that U.S. support bolsters the LAF as a counterweight to Hezbollah and affirming the LAF’s status as an independent, non-sectarian institution respected across Lebanon’s diverse communities. In addition to military aid, $15 million will be allocated to Lebanon’s Internal Security Forces (ISF) to help them serve as the country’s primary law enforcement body and support the LAF in maintaining control in southern Lebanon. This funding will be used to rebuild police stations, upgrade communication systems, and acquire new vehicles. The administration also announced smaller allocations of $3.06 million to the Palestinian Authority police to assist operations in the West Bank and $2.5 million to Jordan’s Public Security Directorate to enhance its response to public demonstrations.The post US redirects $100m military aid to Lebanon to support ceasefire first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-100m-military-aid-lebanon-support-ceasefire/	2025-01-08T06:39:01-08:00	
Opposition backs Aoun from Maarab as Saudi envoy pushes election	The opposition is set to convene a meeting in Maarab at 7:00 PM to officially declare its support for Army Chief Joseph Aoun's candidacy for Lebanon's presidency, according to media reports on Wednesday. This announcement comes ahead of the presidential election session scheduled by Speaker Nabih Berri. In related developments, Saudi envoy Yazid bin Mohammad arrived in Beirut on Wednesday morning to engage in political discussions aimed at facilitating Aoun's election as president, media sources indicated. Meanwhile, Al-Jadeed television reported late Tuesday on ongoing discussions involving key political figures. Talks were held between Free Patriotic Movement leader Jebran Bassil and Hezbollah official Wafiq Safa, as well as a separate, 'secret' meeting between Bassil and Berri. During his meeting with Berri, Bassil reportedly expressed a preference for selecting a candidate aligned with the international community. He proposed former ministers Jihad Azour and Ziad Baroud as potential options, according to Al-Jadeed.The post Opposition backs Aoun from Maarab as Saudi envoy pushes election first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/opposition-backs-aoun-maarab/	2025-01-08T06:38:55-08:00	
Le Drian lands in Lebanon to tackle political deadlock	France’s special envoy to Lebanon, Jean-Yves Le Drian, held a meeting in Beirut on Wednesday with Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri as part of his efforts to help Lebanon resolve its prolonged presidential vacancy. The presidency has remained unfilled for over two years due to deep political and sectarian divisions. Lebanon’s parliament is set to convene on Thursday to elect a president, and Le Drian will attend the session at Berri’s invitation. His visit is part of broader international efforts to facilitate the election, in line with the principles established during the Doha meeting in July 2023. Le Drian is collaborating with representatives of the Quintet — France, the United States, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt — to break the political deadlock. In a statement, Le Drian called on Lebanese lawmakers to find common ground, stressing that electing a president is a critical first step toward reactivating Lebanon’s institutions and restoring its sovereignty. Reports from local media suggest that Le Drian is advocating for the election of Army Chief Joseph Aoun, a leading candidate, ahead of Thursday’s parliamentary session. The evolving political dynamics in Lebanon have added uncertainty to the situation. Hezbollah, a significant force in Lebanese politics, has faced setbacks in recent months following its conflict with Israel, which resulted in the deaths of key officials, including its longtime leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. Compounding this is the fall of President Bashar Assad’s government in Syria, a longtime ally of Hezbollah. The vacancy in Lebanon’s presidency has persisted since October 2022, when former President Michel Aoun, a close ally of the Iran-backed Hezbollah, completed his term.The post Le Drian lands in Lebanon to tackle political deadlock first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/le-drian-lands-lebanon-political-deadlock/	2025-01-08T06:38:44-08:00	
Shiite Duo’s position on Joseph Aoun’s election revealed	Hezbollah and the Amal Movement remain opposed to the nomination of Army Chief Joseph Aoun for Lebanon's presidency, according to a report by al-Jadeed TV on Wednesday. The Shiite Duo maintains its position that electing Aoun would require a constitutional amendment, which they firmly oppose. Their sources reiterated that their primary choice for the presidency remains Suleiman Franjieh, while they are open to considering other candidates, including Major General Elias al-Bayssari. However, they emphasized that they would not support a president whose election would violate the constitution or compromise national sovereignty, indirectly referencing Aoun. According to the Lebanese constitution, senior civil servants, such as Aoun, must vacate their positions at least six months before being eligible for the presidency. The report also noted that Hezbollah and Amal continue to hold discussions and coordinate with the Free Patriotic Movement. However, they will not officially announce their candidate before the presidential election session. Later in the day, al-Jadeed reported that MP Mohammad Raad from Hezbollah conveyed to French envoy Jean-Yves Le Drian that Hezbollah would not obstruct a broad Lebanese consensus on a presidential candidate.The post Shiite Duo’s position on Joseph Aoun’s election revealed first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/shiite-duos-position-joseph-aouns-election-revealed/	2025-01-08T06:38:36-08:00	
Bassil declares votes for Aoun as spoiled	Lebanese lawmakers are set to vote for a new president on Thursday, but divisions persist among political factions regarding the leading candidate, Army Chief Joseph Aoun. Aoun appears to have the backing of international powers, including the United States, France, and Saudi Arabia, but faces resistance from some domestic parties. The Free Patriotic Movement (FPM), led by Jebran Bassil, has not officially declared its candidate. Bassil has argued that electing Aoun would violate the constitution, stating in an interview with LBCI that any vote for Aoun in the January 9 session should be considered invalid. Instead, he has expressed support for former finance minister and International Monetary Fund official Jihad Azour, as well as acting security chief Elias Baissari. Bassil emphasized that when the FPM proposed Azour over a year ago, he was not intended as a confrontational candidate. However, Hezbollah dismissed Azour as a 'confrontation and challenge candidate' after the FPM and opposition reached an agreement on his name. Bassil called for greater flexibility from Amal and Hezbollah, urging them to build consensus with other parties, including the Lebanese Forces (LF). The LF has yet to officially nominate a candidate, though its leader, Samir Geagea, has expressed a willingness to consider supporting Aoun if Hezbollah and Amal formally endorse him. Geagea, who has previously hinted at running for president himself, remains undecided. Aoun has received backing from several factions, including the Kataeb party, independent MPs, and the Democratic Gathering bloc of the Progressive Socialist Party (PSP). However, Hezbollah and Amal remain hesitant to support his candidacy. Reports suggest that their preferred candidate will not be announced until the voting session. While Hezbollah has reportedly vetoed Geagea, they have not ruled out Aoun. Meanwhile, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a key Hezbollah ally, has opposed any constitutional amendments that might facilitate Aoun's election. The Lebanese constitution states that presidential candidates must not have held high public office within the past two years, a provision that could disqualify Aoun. If elected, Aoun would become Lebanon's fifth army commander to assume the presidency and the fourth consecutive one to do so.The post Bassil declares votes for Aoun as spoiled first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/bassil-votes-aoun-spoiled/	2025-01-08T06:38:21-08:00	
Hochstein confirms Israeli forces start Naqoura pullout	U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein announced that Israeli forces began withdrawing from a border town in southern Lebanon on Monday, marking another step in the ongoing ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. This withdrawal, the second since the ceasefire began on November 27, follows calls from United Nations peacekeepers and Lebanon’s prime minister for Israel to expedite its exit from southern Lebanon. Hochstein confirmed that Israeli troops have started pulling back from Naqoura, a town near the U.N.-demarcated Blue Line, and returning to Israeli territory. He emphasized that the withdrawals would continue until all Israeli forces leave Lebanon, while the Lebanese Army takes over security responsibilities in coordination with U.N. peacekeepers. Following meetings with Speaker Nabih Berri and caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati, Hochstein expressed confidence that all parties would uphold their commitments to the ceasefire agreement, despite mutual accusations from Israel and Hezbollah of violating the terms. However, he did not confirm whether the withdrawal would be completed within the 60-day timeframe stipulated in the ceasefire. Hochstein noted that there are still 20 days left in the ceasefire period and pledged to continue efforts to ensure the withdrawal and deployment process remains on track. The agreement, which Hochstein helped negotiate, requires the Lebanese Army and United Nations peacekeepers to deploy in southern Lebanon as Israeli forces withdraw. Hezbollah is also obligated to move its forces north of the Litani River and dismantle any remaining military infrastructure in the area. Prime Minister Mikati reiterated the need for a clear timeline to complete the withdrawal by the deadline, rejecting any notion of extending the ceasefire period. The Lebanese Army confirmed its deployment around Naqoura in coordination with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) as Israeli troops vacated the area. The withdrawal and deployment coincided with a meeting of the five-member committee overseeing the ceasefire, which includes representatives from Israel, Lebanon, France, the United States, and UNIFIL. Hochstein co-chaired the meeting alongside U.S. Major General Jasper Jeffers, stating that the mechanism for managing the ceasefire is functioning effectively. While progress may not have been as swift as some had hoped, Hochstein expressed optimism after observing developments in Naqoura. Tensions remain, however, with Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz accusing Hezbollah of failing to comply with the ceasefire terms, including withdrawing north of the Litani River. Hezbollah has similarly accused Israel of violations. Earlier in December, the Lebanese Army deployed around Khiam following an Israeli troop withdrawal, marking the first such transition under the ceasefire agreement. During his visit, Hochstein also addressed Lebanon’s political situation, urging leaders to reach a consensus ahead of an upcoming presidential election. Lebanon has been without a president for over two years due to political divisions between Hezbollah and its rivals. Hochstein emphasized the importance of unity to implement reforms, rebuild the economy, and attract investment, presenting the moment as a critical opportunity for the Lebanese people. Hochstein and Jeffers also met with Lebanese Army Commander Joseph Aoun to discuss the ceasefire. Aoun, whose name has been mentioned as a potential presidential candidate, remains a key figure in the country’s security and political landscape.The post Hochstein confirms Israeli forces start Naqoura pullout first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hochstein-confirms-israeli-forces-naqoura-pullout/	2025-01-07T11:24:13-08:00	
Jumblat backs Aoun, rejects peace with Israel	Druze leader Walid Jumblat reaffirmed his support for Army Commander General Joseph Aoun as his bloc's candidate for Lebanon's presidency, noting that the nomination has received favorable responses from the five-nation group focused on Lebanon's situation. Jumblat emphasized the urgency of electing a president in the first round, warning against delaying the election until after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. He argued that postponement could lead to uncertainty, which the country cannot afford. He stated that General Aoun’s candidacy represents an opportunity, and if his election fails, there is no viable alternative. Commenting on the recent Israeli conflict with Lebanon, Jumblat acknowledged that Hezbollah was not defeated and expressed respect for the martyrs. However, he pointed out internal challenges within Hezbollah and urged acceptance of the new realities. He rejected recent remarks by Hezbollah figures Sheikh Naim Qassem and Wafiq Safa, instead advocating for strengthening and fortifying the state. Jumblat suggested that Hezbollah fighters could be integrated into the Lebanese army. Jumblat also expressed concerns about ongoing Israeli violations, suggesting that Israel might aim to create a new buffer zone in southern Lebanon. He highlighted the importance of leveraging the presence of U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, warning of Israel’s ambitions, particularly regarding the Litani River’s waters. He acknowledged Iran’s continued support for Hezbollah, providing available resources, but noted that these capabilities are no match for U.S. technology. Despite this, Jumblat reiterated his firm stance against peace with Israel, stating his opposition both now and for future generations. Jumblat revealed that he had previously urged Hezbollah, through messages, to avoid involvement in the conflict. While there is currently no contact with Wafiq Safa, Jumblat mentioned he is open to meeting him and noted no ongoing relationship with Sheikh Naim Qassem. The Druze leader called on Hezbollah to transition into a political party, stressing that Lebanon has endured enough wars and must prioritize stability for the benefit of future generations.

US and French generals inspect 5th Brigade ops in the south	U.S. Major General Jasper Jeffers, Chairman of the Cessation of Hostilities Implementation Mechanism, accompanied by French Brigadier General Guillaume Ponchin, visited the headquarters of the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) 5th Brigade in southwest Lebanon on Tuesday morning, according to a statement from the U.S. Embassy. The 5th Brigade's headquarters is located approximately five kilometers northeast of Naqoura, a town recently placed under LAF control following the initial phase of the Israeli forces' withdrawal on January 6. As part of the transition facilitated by the Mechanism, the LAF promptly deployed troops to the region to secure the area, clear roads, remove unauthorized munitions, and ensure the safety of the local population, the Embassy’s statement detailed. During their visit, Generals Jeffers and Ponchin inspected stockpiles of weapons confiscated from unauthorized armed groups, which are scheduled to be destroyed in the coming days. Major General Jeffers praised the efforts of the LAF, emphasizing their role as Lebanon’s legitimate security force. He highlighted the LAF's demonstrated capability, intent, and leadership in maintaining the country's security and defending its people. He specifically commended the swift and professional actions of the LAF, noting the expertise displayed by the soldiers of the 5th Brigade. He lauded the engineer corps, which safely removes and neutralizes hundreds of unexploded ordnance pieces each week, showcasing their dedication and professionalism in ensuring the safety of the region.The post US and French generals inspect 5th Brigade ops in the south first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/us-french-generals-inspect-5th-brigade-ops-south/	2025-01-07T11:23:30-08:00	
Israel Accuses Hamas of Withholding Hostage Status Despite Readin...	Israel announced on Monday that Hamas had not yet confirmed the status of 34 hostages the group had previously indicated it was willing to release as part of a potential exchange deal. Qatar, Egypt, and the United States have been involved in months-long efforts to broker a deal to end the war in Gaza. However, both sides have accused each other of obstructing the negotiations. In recent days, indirect talks between Israel and Hamas have resumed, even as Israeli forces continue their attacks on Gaza. According to a statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, Israel has yet to receive confirmation from Hamas regarding the status of the 34 hostages the group expressed readiness to free. The list of hostages was initially provided by Israel to the mediators in July 2024, not by Hamas. A senior Hamas official confirmed late on Sunday that the group had agreed to release 34 Israeli prisoners, as part of the first phase of a proposed prisoner exchange. The official stated that the swap would include women, children, the elderly, and the sick, but Hamas required additional time to assess the condition of the hostages. Hamas also mentioned that it would take a week of calm to determine which captives were alive and which were dead. The official added that Hamas would release the hostages, whether they were alive or dead. The war in Gaza began after a large-scale attack by Palestinian militants on October 7, 2023, which led to the capture of 251 Israeli hostages, with 96 still in Gaza. Israel's military reports that 34 of these hostages have died. On Monday, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum called for a comprehensive agreement to secure the release of the hostages, emphasizing that more than half of them are still alive and need immediate care. They also urged for the return of those who were killed for proper burial. There was a brief truce in November 2023 that saw 80 Israeli hostages freed in exchange for 240 Palestinians released from Israeli prisons. As of now, neither Israel nor Hamas has provided detailed information about the ongoing negotiations in Doha. However, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz confirmed on Saturday that talks were taking place. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed optimism about a potential ceasefire deal, though he suggested it might only come after President Joe Biden leaves office on January 20. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on the same date, has promised stronger support for Israel and warned Hamas of severe consequences if the hostages are not released. The situation remains tense, with Israeli airstrikes continuing to target Gaza. The latest strikes, including one that killed at least 11 people in northern Gaza, have escalated the death toll, with Israeli military actions having claimed the lives of 45,805 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to local health officials. The war began after the October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, which left 1,208 people dead, mostly civilians.The post Israel Accuses Hamas of Withholding Hostage Status Despite Readiness to Free Them first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-hamas-withholding-hostage-status/	2025-01-06T05:36:56-08:00	
Hochstein Arrives in Beirut Amid Shaky Truce Deal	U.S. special envoy Amos Hochstein arrived in Beirut on Monday amid a fragile truce between Lebanon and Israel, which began on November 27. On Sunday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz warned that no agreement would be reached unless Hezbollah withdrew beyond the Litani River. Meanwhile, Hezbollah’s new leader, Sheikh Naim Qassem, expressed concerns that the group's patience with Israeli violations might run out before the ceasefire's 60-day period ends. Israeli state media reported that Israeli forces would not withdraw from southern Lebanon when the 60-day ceasefire period concludes. Hochstein, who had spent over a year facilitating shuttle diplomacy to secure the ceasefire, now co-chairs a U.S.-led monitoring committee with representatives from France, the U.N. peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon, as well as Lebanon and Israel. MTV reported that Hochstein is expected to propose extending the ceasefire period by an additional 60 days. He will also caution Lebanese officials that the monitoring committee could intervene to disarm Hezbollah in southern Lebanon if the Lebanese army does not deploy ten thousand soldiers south of the Litani River. Furthermore, Hochstein is expected to address the issue of Lebanon's presidential election with key Lebanese figures, advocating for the election of Army Chief Gen. Joseph Aoun. MTV also mentioned that Hochstein would link Aoun’s election to the ceasefire’s continuation and Lebanon's reconstruction efforts. Hezbollah’s Coordination and Liaison Unit head, Wafiq Safa, stated on Sunday that his group does not have a veto over Aoun's election, only against Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea. Safa also emphasized that it is the Lebanese state's responsibility to address Israeli violations, with Speaker Nabih Berri planning to discuss these issues with Hochstein. Before arriving in Lebanon, Hochstein met with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan in Riyadh.The post Hochstein Arrives in Beirut Amid Shaky Truce Deal first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hochstein-arrives-beirut-shaky-truce-deal/	2025-01-06T05:36:46-08:00	
Israeli Army Intercepts Missile Fired from Yemen	On Sunday, the Israeli military reported that it had intercepted a missile launched from Yemen, marking the latest in a series of recent attacks. According to the military, the missile was intercepted before it could enter Israeli airspace after sirens sounded in the Talmei Elazar region. The missile was launched by Yemen's Houthi rebels, who control large parts of northern Yemen, including the capital, Sanaa. The Houthis stated that the missile was a hypersonic ballistic missile aimed at a power station located south of Haifa, Israel. Earlier in the week, on Friday, Israel's military also reported intercepting a missile and a drone launched from Yemen. These recent attacks come amid a broader escalation by Iran-backed groups, including Hezbollah, which has been involved in cross-border exchanges with Israel since the Hamas attack on October 7. The Houthis, like Hezbollah, have stated that their actions are in support of Palestinians and have pledged to continue their attacks until a ceasefire is achieved in Gaza. While most missiles and drones launched from Yemen have been intercepted, one missile did manage to strike Tel Aviv in December, injuring 16 people, according to Israel's military and emergency services. In retaliation, Israel has conducted airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen, including at Sanaa's international airport. In addition to missile attacks, the Houthis have targeted ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, disrupting vital shipping routes and prompting military responses from the United States and occasionally Britain. On Sunday, the Houthi news agency Saba and Al-Masirah TV reported airstrikes on locations east of Saada, a city in northern Yemen, attributing the attacks to the U.S. and the U.K. However, neither country provided an immediate comment on the report. The Iranian foreign ministry condemned the airstrikes carried out by the U.S. and U.K. against Houthi infrastructure in Saada province, with spokesperson Esmail Baghaei expressing strong disapproval.The post Israeli Army Intercepts Missile Fired from Yemen first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-army-intercepts-missile-yemen/	2025-01-05T06:38:09-08:00	
UN Accuses Israel of Ceasefire Violation as Hezbollah’s Patience ...	The U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon has accused Israel of a significant breach of the 2006 Security Council resolution, which is the foundation of the ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah that went into effect in November. This accusation from the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) comes as Hezbollah leader Sheikh Naim Qassem warned that the group's tolerance for Israeli violations could expire before the 60-day ceasefire period ends. The ceasefire, which began on November 27, has been marked by mutual claims of violations from both parties involved. The peacekeeping force reported that Israeli military bulldozers were seen destroying a blue barrel that marks the withdrawal line between Lebanon and Israel in Labbouneh, as well as an observation tower belonging to the Lebanese Armed Forces near a UNIFIL position. UNIFIL condemned the destruction of these identifiable properties, calling it a blatant violation of Resolution 1701 and international law. The peacekeeping force, which is part of the committee overseeing the ceasefire's implementation, urged all parties to avoid actions that could endanger the cessation of hostilities, including damaging civilian property and infrastructure. The terms of the ceasefire require the Lebanese Army to deploy alongside UNIFIL forces in southern Lebanon, while the Israeli army withdraws over a 60-day period. Hezbollah is also expected to pull its forces north of the Litani River, about 30 kilometers from the border, and dismantle any remaining military infrastructure in the south. In late December, UNIFIL expressed concern over the ongoing damage caused by Israeli military activities in southern Lebanon. In its recent operations, the Israeli military justified airstrikes as part of efforts to eliminate potential threats in line with the ceasefire arrangements. Qassem stated that Hezbollah has chosen to remain patient for now but warned that this patience is not unlimited. He clarified that the group is giving Israel an opportunity to prevent further violations and implement the agreement, but emphasized that Hezbollah's leadership will decide when to take action, respond, or shift tactics.The post UN Accuses Israel of Ceasefire Violation as Hezbollah’s Patience Wears Thin first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/un-israel-ceasefire-violation-hezbollahs-patience-thin/	2025-01-05T06:38:01-08:00	
Safa: No Veto on Army Chief, Only Geagea	Hezbollah's Coordination and Liaison Unit leader, Wafiq Safa, stated on Sunday that his group does not hold a 'veto' power over the potential election of Army chief Joseph Aoun as president. He clarified that the only veto held by Hezbollah concerns Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea, whom they consider a source of conflict and destruction for Lebanon. Safa also asserted that Hezbollah remains stronger than ever, with its capabilities fully restored. He emphasized the group's readiness to defend itself against any threats in a manner of its choosing, urging others not to challenge them. Regarding Israeli actions, Safa mentioned that Speaker Nabih Berri would engage in talks with U.S. mediator Amos Hochstein to address ongoing Israeli violations. When asked about Hezbollah's response if Israel fails to withdraw from Lebanon within the 60-day deadline, Safa noted that neither the Lebanese Army nor the monitoring committee has been updated on the situation. He emphasized that after the 60-day period, Hezbollah and the resistance would determine the next steps. Safa also referenced a statement by Sheikh Naim Qassem, asserting that the Lebanese government, which signed the agreement, is responsible for following up on ceasefire enforcement or violations.The post Safa: No Veto on Army Chief, Only Geagea first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/safa-no-veto-army-chief-only-geagea/	2025-01-05T06:37:52-08:00	
Katz: Ceasefire at Risk if Hezbollah Stays Near Litani	Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz issued a warning on Sunday, stating that if Hezbollah does not retreat beyond the Litani River, there will be no agreement, and Israel will have to take action. Katz emphasized Israel's commitment to ensuring the full implementation of the agreement in Lebanon, with a focus on safeguarding the return of residents in northern Israel. However, Katz made it clear that the key condition for the agreement's success is Hezbollah’s complete withdrawal from the area, the dismantling of their weapons, and the removal of terror infrastructure by the Lebanese Army, which has yet to occur. He further stated that if these conditions are not met, there will be no deal, and Israel will be forced to take independent measures to ensure the safe return of residents to their homes.The post Katz: Ceasefire at Risk if Hezbollah Stays Near Litani first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/katz-ceasefire-risk-hezbollah-litani/	2025-01-05T06:37:38-08:00	
Bassil Threatens Geagea Support If Hezbollah Backs Aoun	Jebran Bassil, the leader of the Free Patriotic Movement, has issued a warning to Hezbollah regarding its support for Army Chief Joseph Aoun in the presidential race, according to reports from local media outlet al-Jadeed. Bassil reportedly informed both Hezbollah and the Amal Movement that he would back Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea for the presidency, but only if they agree to support Aoun. Geagea had previously suggested he might run for president if he could garner sufficient political backing. Bassil, in an interview with al-Joumhouria, expressed his belief that Geagea has strong Christian support, making him a legitimate presidential candidate, and he would be willing to endorse him if he could help unite the Lebanese people. Bassil also mentioned he preferred Geagea over both Aoun and Hezbollah’s candidate, Marada leader Suleiman Franjieh. In an effort to end the political deadlock, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri has called for a parliamentary session on January 9 to elect a president. This move aims to break the two-year stalemate and revive Lebanon's struggling state institutions. It is reported that delegations from France, Saudi Arabia, and the United States, who are visiting Lebanon this week, will advocate for Aoun’s election. Lebanon has been without a president since Michel Aoun's term expired in October 2022. However, the two main political factions—Hezbollah and its opponents—have been unable to secure a majority or reach an agreement on a candidate. While Aoun is known to have good relationships with a range of political groups, including Hezbollah, he faces criticism from Hezbollah and its allies due to his ties with the United States, Lebanon’s key financial backer for the army. Aoun recently visited Saudi Arabia at the invitation of the Saudi King, and the presidential issue was reportedly discussed during the meetings. The United States, France, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt have all been working together for several months to help facilitate the election of a new Lebanese president.The post Bassil Threatens Geagea Support If Hezbollah Backs Aoun first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/bassil-threatens-geagea-support-hezbollah-aoun/	2025-01-02T06:35:34-08:00	
Israel Warns of Escalated Gaza Strikes	Israel has warned that it will increase its airstrikes on Gaza if Hamas continues to launch rocket attacks. On the first day of the New Year, Palestinian rescuers reported numerous casualties from Israeli strikes, which have been focused on northern Gaza where the Israeli military is conducting a major operation. Despite the recent rocket fire from Palestinian militants, which has been less frequent and less damaging than earlier in the conflict, it remains a political challenge for Israel, especially after nearly 15 months of fighting. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz issued a stern warning, stating that Hamas would face intensified strikes if it does not allow the release of Israeli hostages or stop targeting Israeli communities. As of now, Hamas still holds 96 hostages taken during their October 7, 2023 attack, and negotiations for their release or a ceasefire have not succeeded. Israeli military operations have continued across Gaza, with one recent strike in the town of Jabalia killing 15 people and injuring more than 20, according to Gaza's civil defense. The military claims it targeted Hamas militants in the area. The operations in northern Gaza, including the bombing of Jabalia and its refugee camp, are part of an effort to prevent Hamas from regrouping. However, the United Nations has raised concerns that the ongoing siege could lead to the permanent displacement of Gaza's population, potentially setting the stage for Gaza's annexation. The human toll of the conflict is severe, with entire families affected by the violence. A relative of victims in Jabalia described the strike as a massacre, with civilians, including children and women, killed while they slept. Many Gaza residents are now living in fear, not only due to the bombings but also the harsh winter conditions. Some have been unable to sleep for days due to the risk of illness or further missile strikes. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza is escalating, with ongoing reports of civilian casualties from Israeli bombings. UN aid officials describe widespread destruction and despair, as many people struggle to survive without adequate shelter or medical care. The Israeli military has also faced criticism for its claims that Hamas uses hospitals as military bases, an accusation that Hamas denies. As the conflict continues, the death toll in Gaza has reached at least 45,553 people, mostly civilians, while 1,208 people have been killed in Israel, according to official figures from both sides.The post Israel Warns of Escalated Gaza Strikes first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-warns-escalated-gaza-strikes/	2025-01-02T06:35:23-08:00	
Syrian Forces Sweep Homs in Major Security Operation	Syrian security forces are currently carrying out a large-scale operation in Homs city, according to state media reports. The operation, which is focused on two districts predominantly inhabited by the Alawite minority, follows an announcement from the Ministry of Interior and the Military Operations Department. The target of the operation is individuals involved in criminal activities who have refused to surrender their weapons and join settlement centers. The authorities are also searching for hidden arms and ammunition. A security official quoted by state news agency SANA stated that the operation is aimed at war criminals and those who have been involved in crimes. The operation follows earlier reports suggesting that remnants of Assad’s militias remain in parts of Homs, prompting the authorities to intensify their efforts. Since the overthrow of President Bashar al-Assad by Islamist-led rebels last month, a transitional government has been registering former soldiers and conscripts, asking them to relinquish their arms. Troops and armored forces have been deployed to search for individuals refusing to comply, particularly in Homs. A curfew has also been imposed in some parts of the city, and the Ministry of Interior has advised residents of certain neighborhoods to stay indoors and cooperate with security forces. A resident of one of the affected districts, Akrama, fled the area and reported heavy gunfire and the presence of military tanks. He mentioned that communications had been cut off, and there were reports of house searches and arrests of young men. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, stated that the two targeted districts, Wadi al-Dhahab and Akrama, are majority-Alawite, the sect to which the Assad family belongs. The ongoing operation is believed to be targeting former Shabiha militia members and individuals who were involved in pro-Assad demonstrations, which the new government viewed as a threat to its authority. Concerns over sectarian tensions have been raised, especially after protests broke out in Syria on December 25 following a video showing an attack on an Alawite shrine in the north. Although the ministry has stated that the video is old, activists have criticized the security sweeps, warning against actions that could exacerbate sectarian divisions and violate people's rights. Alawites, who have long been associated with the Assad regime, fear backlash due to their community's ties to the former president. The new leadership in Syria has sought to reassure minorities that they will be protected. However, tensions remain high, as evidenced by recent clashes in the Alawite-majority province of Tartus, where several security personnel were killed.The post Syrian Forces Sweep Homs in Major Security Operation first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/syrian-forces-sweep-homs-security-operation/	2025-01-02T06:35:12-08:00

Israel Blames ‘Discipline Lapse’ in Death of Archaeologist Crossi...	The Israeli military has attributed the death of a 70-year-old archaeologist and another soldier in southern Lebanon to 'operational burnout' and a 'weakening of discipline and safety' during a visit to a combat zone in November. Zeev Erlich, who was not on active duty at the time, was wearing a military uniform and carrying a weapon when he was shot. Although he was not actively serving, the army classified him as a reservist with the rank of major and referred to him as a 'fallen soldier.' Erlich was a well-known figure in the West Bank, recognized for his work in Jewish history. Reports suggested that he had entered Lebanon to explore an archaeological site. The family of the soldier killed alongside him has expressed frustration over the circumstances surrounding his death. Following the incident, the Israeli military launched an investigation, with a separate inquiry focusing on how Erlich was permitted to enter the combat zone. While the military stressed that the entry of civilians, who are not military contractors or journalists, into such areas is rare, there have been previous reports of Israeli civilians, particularly those in favor of a permanent Israeli presence in Gaza or Lebanon, accessing these regions.The post Israel Blames ‘Discipline Lapse’ in Death of Archaeologist Crossing into Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-discipline-lapse-death-archaeologist/	2025-01-01T07:00:07-08:00	
Iran Set for Nuclear Talks with Europe on January 13	Iran is scheduled to engage in nuclear discussions with France, Britain, and Germany on January 13 in Geneva, Switzerland, as reported by local media. Kazem Gharibabadi, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister for Legal and International Affairs, confirmed that these meetings are intended as 'consultations, not negotiations.' This upcoming round of talks follows a November 2024 meeting where tensions escalated after a European-backed resolution accused Iran of inadequate cooperation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog. In response, Tehran announced plans to install additional uranium-enriching centrifuges at its enrichment facilities. The United Nations' nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, has expressed concern over Iran's accelerated uranium enrichment, noting that Iran is 'dramatically' increasing its enrichment levels to up to 60% purity, which is closer to the approximately 90% purity required for weapons-grade uranium. In 2018, the United States withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement under President Donald Trump and reimposed stringent sanctions on Iran. This action prompted Tehran to violate the agreement's nuclear limits, including rebuilding stockpiles of enriched uranium, refining it to higher fissile purity, and installing advanced centrifuges to expedite production. Indirect talks between the Biden administration and Tehran to revive the pact have been unsuccessful. President Trump has indicated a willingness to negotiate, stating during his election campaign in September: 'We have to make a deal, because the consequences are impossible. We have to make a deal.' As the January 13 talks approach, the international community remains attentive to Iran's nuclear activities and its engagement with European powers, with hopes for a resolution that addresses proliferation concerns and regional stability.

10 Dead, 30 Injured in New Orleans Vehicle Attack	A man with a clear intent to cause widespread destruction drove a pickup truck at high speed into a crowd of people celebrating New Year's Eve in New Orleans, leading to at least ten fatalities and leaving over 35 others injured. The incident took place around 3:15 am local time in the city's lively French Quarter, which was filled with revelers welcoming 2025.

Additionally, the driver shot at police officers, injuring two of them, and was intent on causing as much harm as he could. The whereabouts and condition of the driver remain unknown at this time. While the attack is not officially categorized as a terrorist act, Superintendent Kirkpatrick emphasized the truck’s high speed and the deliberate nature of the incident. The FBI will now lead the investigation into the event. Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry described the attack as a 'horrific act of violence.' Eyewitnesses told CBS News that the truck drove through the crowd before the driver got out and began shooting at police officers. Witnesses Jim and Nicole Mowrer described seeing a white truck break through a barricade at high speed. Nicole Mowrer recounted hearing gunfire and seeing police rush toward the scene.

French Ministers Visit Lebanon for Talks Amid Israel-Hezbollah Tr...	France's Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot and Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu arrived in Lebanon on Monday, marking their visit after a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah brought an end to the intense fighting that had plagued the region since late November. During their visit, Barrot and Lecornu met with Lebanese army chief Joseph Aoun. The following day, they are scheduled to visit U.N. peacekeepers stationed near the Israeli border. According to a statement from the Lebanese army on social media, the discussions between Aoun and the French officials focused on strengthening cooperation between the two countries' armies and continuing support for the Lebanese army in light of the ongoing situation. Aoun, who is considered a potential candidate for Lebanon’s presidency, has been responsible for deploying troops in southern Lebanon since the ceasefire took effect on November 27. Lecornu stated on social media that he is also set to meet with a French general involved in the ceasefire monitoring mechanism. He emphasized France's ongoing commitment to the stability of Lebanon and the broader region. This monitoring body includes representatives from Lebanon, Israel, the United States, France, and the U.N.'s UNIFIL peacekeeping mission, and is tasked with overseeing the ceasefire's implementation and addressing any violations. The UNIFIL peacekeeping force expressed concern on Thursday over the ongoing destruction in southern Lebanon by the Israeli army, despite the ceasefire being in place. On Tuesday, Lecornu and Barrot are expected to meet with French troops serving in the UNIFIL mission in southern Lebanon.The post French Ministers Visit Lebanon for Talks Amid Israel-Hezbollah Truce first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/french-ministers-lebanon-talks-truce/	2024-12-31T09:57:56-08:00	
Hezbollah Warns Israel: Leave South Lebanon After 60 Days	Mahmoud Qmati, the deputy head of Hezbollah's political council, has issued a warning that Hezbollah will change its approach towards Israeli soldiers if they remain in Lebanon for more than 60 days, which marks the initial phase of a ceasefire agreed upon in late November. Qmati explained that Hezbollah has committed to a period of patience for 60 days, but after this time, Israeli forces will be viewed as occupying troops, and Hezbollah will take appropriate action. The ceasefire agreement, brokered by France and the United States, outlines a gradual withdrawal of both Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters from southern Lebanon over the 60-day period. However, since the ceasefire began, Israel has continued to carry out occasional airstrikes in Lebanon, and its troops have advanced instead of retreating, bulldozing villages and detonating explosives along the border. Qmati emphasized that there are red lines, including issues related to Hezbollah’s weapons and the funding for reconstruction efforts. He accused certain domestic figures of acting in Israel's interests and stressed that Hezbollah does not want aid tied to conditions that would undermine its resistance. He further warned that France and the U.S. must understand that Hezbollah will not tolerate violations of these red lines, and they are prepared to take any necessary action. He reiterated that Hezbollah would not accept the occupation of Lebanon's land. Hezbollah has been patient so far for the sake of its people and in keeping with its commitment to the mediators. However, Qmati made it clear that after the 60-day period, on day 61, Hezbollah will treat Israeli forces as occupiers and respond accordingly. He also stated that Hezbollah's resistance capabilities remain strong and that the group is not bound by the ceasefire if Israel does not fully honor it. He indicated that either both sides must commit to the ceasefire, or neither will. Qmati added that many supporters and residents who have returned to villages in southern Lebanon are now calling on Hezbollah to take action in response to Israeli violations. He noted that the patience displayed by Hezbollah so far was for the benefit of these people, but now they are demanding retaliation.The post Hezbollah Warns Israel: Leave South Lebanon After 60 Days first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-warns-israel-leave-south-lebanon-60-days/	2024-12-31T09:57:49-08:00
