Israeli Strikes in Lebanon’s Bekaa Kill 60 in Single Day	Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley killed at least 60 people and injured 58 others on Monday, according to Lebanese state media, as air raids intensified across the region. The heaviest casualties were reported in Sahl Allak in Baalbek province, where 16 people lost their lives, the National News Agency (NNA) confirmed, noting fatalities across 12 different areas in the Bekaa Valley. In Ramm, another town in Baalbek, nine people, including a mother and her four children, were killed, and one person was wounded, per NNA. Baalbek’s Mayor Bachir Khodr called it 'the most violent day in Baalbek since the start of the aggression,' in a post on X (formerly Twitter), noting that people remain trapped beneath the rubble. Israel’s ongoing air campaign against Hezbollah has increasingly targeted the Bekaa Valley, southern Lebanon, and Beirut’s southern suburbs, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of civilians alongside its stated goal of combating the Hezbollah militia.The post Israeli Strikes in Lebanon’s Bekaa Kill 60 in Single Day first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strikes-lebanons-bekaa-kill-60-single-day/	2024-10-29T04:29:08-07:00	
Mikati Meets British PM Amid Israel’s Assurance: Lebanon War to E...	British Prime Minister Keir Starmer met with Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati in London on Monday, offering condolences for the loss of Lebanese citizens in recent Israeli strikes. Lebanon’s Health Ministry has reported that over 2,700 people have died, with close to 12,600 injured during the year-long conflict between Hezbollah and Israel. Women and children make up about a quarter of those who lost their lives. During their meeting, Starmer and Mikati agreed on the need for an immediate ceasefire to protect civilians and essential infrastructure, according to a statement from Starmer’s office. 'The prime minister emphasized the importance of de-escalating tensions and working toward a lasting, sustainable peace in the Middle East,' a spokesperson for Starmer said. This meeting followed a statement by UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy to British lawmakers, where he shared that Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz had assured him the current military operation in Lebanon would conclude soon. 'He sought to reassure me that the ongoing targeted operation by Israel would be ending shortly, as he put it,' Lammy stated.The post Mikati Meets British PM Amid Israel’s Assurance: Lebanon War to End Soon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/mikati-british-pm-israels-assurance-lebanon-war-end-soon/	2024-10-29T04:28:48-07:00	
Hezbollah Appoints Naim Qassem as New Leader	Hezbollah announced on Tuesday that Sheikh Naim Qassem, the deputy leader, has been chosen to succeed Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah as the group’s leader following Nasrallah’s death in an Israeli airstrike on southern Beirut last month. In a statement, Hezbollah’s Shura Council confirmed, 'Sheikh Naim Qassem has been elected as the secretary general of Hezbollah,' more than a month after Nasrallah’s assassination. Initially, Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, who led Hezbollah’s executive council, was expected to replace Nasrallah. However, he too was killed shortly after in an Israeli strike on Beirut’s southern suburbs. Qassem, 71, helped found Hezbollah in 1982 and has served as the organization’s deputy secretary general since 1991, one year before Nasrallah assumed leadership. Born in Beirut in 1953 to a family from Kfar Fila in southern Lebanon, Qassem has been one of Hezbollah’s most prominent public figures, continuing to make appearances even after Nasrallah went largely into hiding following the group’s 2006 conflict with Israel. Since Nasrallah’s death in an Israeli strike on September 27, Qassem has delivered three televised speeches, adopting a more formal Arabic style in contrast to the colloquial Lebanese often used by Nasrallah.The post Hezbollah Appoints Naim Qassem as New Leader first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-appoints-naim-qassem-new-leader/	2024-10-29T04:27:57-07:00	
Bloodbath: Israeli Strike on Northern Gaza Kills 60	An Israeli airstrike hit a five-story building in Beit Lahiya, northern Gaza, where displaced Palestinians had sought shelter, resulting in at least 60 fatalities, Gaza health officials reported early Tuesday. Dr. Marwan al-Hams, head of the field hospitals at the Gaza Health Ministry, shared this death toll at a news briefing, adding that 17 others remain missing. The emergency services report indicates the casualties include at least 12 women and 20 children, with some of the children being infants. Israel’s military, which has been conducting a major operation in northern Gaza for over three weeks to target what it claims are Hamas militant strongholds, has not yet issued a statement on this specific strike. Kamal Adwan Hospital, located nearby, was overwhelmed with injured victims from the incident, according to its director, Dr. Hossam Abu Safiya. Israeli forces reportedly raided the same hospital over the weekend, detaining dozens of medical personnel, claiming many were Hamas members. While Israel states its strikes are aimed at Hamas militants, shelters for displaced civilians have frequently been affected, often leading to casualties among women and children.The post Bloodbath: Israeli Strike on Northern Gaza Kills 60 first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strike-northern-gaza-kills-60/	2024-10-29T04:27:45-07:00	
Peace: 60-Day Truce in Lebanon on the Horizon?	According to Israel’s Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, senior Israeli officials report that cease-fire negotiations with Lebanon are in 'advanced stages.' White House envoy Amos Hochstein may soon visit Israel and Lebanon ahead of the U.S. presidential election on November 5 to finalize terms. If discussions progress, the Israeli army plans to withdraw most of its troops, redeploying only in southern Lebanon locations of 'tactical significance' after addressing the threat posed by Hezbollah’s Radwan forces. Israeli officials noted that Lebanon’s stance has 'completely shifted' following Israel’s offensive, with Beirut reportedly agreeing to separate the conflicts in Lebanon and Gaza. The officials emphasized that fighting would persist while negotiations proceed. Western intelligence sources suggest that Iran may permit, or even encourage, Hezbollah to agree to a cease-fire regardless of the situation in Gaza. Under the proposed agreement, a 60-day acclimation period would commence during which Hezbollah and the Israeli army would halt fire. The Lebanese Army would also deploy in the south, with consideration given to establishing a new oversight mechanism, though no new U.N. Security Council resolution would be passed. French and American officials highlighted Hezbollah’s recent losses in leadership and personnel, calling the present circumstances a 'unique opportunity.' The draft deal between Israel, Lebanon, the U.S., and additional partners consists of three main elements: Expanded Implementation of U.N. Resolution 1701: Passed after the 2006 Lebanon War, this resolution mandates no Hezbollah fighters south of the Litani River, especially near Israel’s Metula settlement. Lebanon’s army would deploy 5,000-10,000 troops along the border, and UNIFIL forces may be expanded with possible replacements from France, Britain, and Germany. International Oversight Mechanism: An international body would be established to monitor compliance and assess any reported violations. The U.S. agreed that, should Hezbollah build fortifications south of the Litani and the Lebanese Army or UNIFIL fail to address it, Israel could take decisive action. Israel has also requested a formal letter from U.S. President Joe Biden affirming Israel’s right to self-defense. Preventing Hezbollah’s Re-arming: Measures would be taken to block Hezbollah from importing banned weaponry by air, land, or sea. Russia has offered to help enforce the agreement, potentially playing a stabilizing role in Lebanon and Syria. Israel is engaging with Russia to reduce dependence on U.S. involvement, believing Russian participation could strengthen the agreement’s enforcement. Prime Minister Netanyahu’s envoys have been enlisting other countries for oversight roles in the agreement, with Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer collaborating with U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant discussing the terms with Hochstein. Netanyahu’s office denied a Channel 12 report claiming Israel and the U.S. discussed limiting Israel’s ground operations in Lebanon in exchange for future support from the White House to prevent Hezbollah’s re-arming. However, sources told The Times of Israel that Netanyahu aims to conclude the conflict in Lebanon with an arrangement ensuring Hezbollah’s withdrawal from southern Lebanon.The post Peace: 60-Day Truce in Lebanon on the Horizon? first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/60-day-truce-lebanon-horizon/	2024-10-29T04:27:30-07:00	
Iranian President Vows ‘Appropriate’ Response to Israeli Strikes	Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has declared that Iran will respond 'appropriately' to Israel following its recent direct attacks on Iranian military sites, marking the first openly acknowledged strikes by Israel. 'We do not seek conflict, but we will defend our nation’s rights and respond to the Zionist regime’s aggression,' Pezeshkian stated on Sunday, according to Iranian state television. Pezeshkian also revealed that the U.S. had assured Iran it would work to halt the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon if Iran showed restraint, a promise he claims went unfulfilled. 'They promised to end the conflict in exchange for our restraint, yet they have not upheld their word,' he said. The president warned that continued Israeli aggression would heighten tensions, asserting, 'We are aware that the United States is encouraging Israel to commit these actions.'The post Iranian President Vows ‘Appropriate’ Response to Israeli Strikes first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/iranian-president-appropriate-response-israeli-strikes/	2024-10-28T03:28:09-07:00	
Israeli Airstrikes on Lebanon-Syria Border Crossings Spark Major ...	On Sunday, refugees fleeing from Lebanon to Syria used a narrow makeshift bridge in Syria’s Qusair area, Homs province, after Israel’s recent strike disabled the official border crossing two days prior. The two countries share a 375-kilometer border, with only three functional crossings remaining. In recent weeks, Israeli airstrikes have struck Lebanon’s Matraba crossing in the northeast, followed by a hit on the primary Masnaa crossing, and most recently the Jousieh crossing on Friday, forcing closures. Israel claims that Hezbollah uses these routes to transport weapons and equipment between Syria and Lebanon. However, humanitarian workers warn that these closures are worsening an already critical humanitarian situation, blocking crucial supply routes and access for those trying to escape the conflict. 'The situation is a tragedy,' shared Ghossoun Mubarak, who crossed the makeshift bridge with her three children after fleeing intense bombardment in Baalbek, eastern Lebanon. The U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) reports that approximately 430,000 people have crossed from Lebanon into Syria over the past month since Israel began a widespread aerial and ground assault in Lebanon. Lebanese authorities put the number even higher, at over half a million. UNHCR spokesperson Rula Amin expressed serious concern about the impact of border closures, calling these crossings 'a crucial lifeline for people fleeing the conflict.' Omar Abu Jabal, 29, who returned to Lebanon through Jousieh on Sunday after a work trip, noted that the day’s crossing was calm. 'Today, it was better. No issues along the way. But before, bombings stopped people from moving,' he said. Nabil Aakoul, head of transportation for Homs province, highlighted the recent damage to a bridge over the Orontes River from these airstrikes. The destruction has isolated agricultural areas and disrupted trade, with rebuilding costs projected at around 35 billion Syrian pounds ($2.5 million). This has left surrounding communities cut off from essential travel and trade routes. Local resident Yahya Abu Youssef described the bridge attack as 'inhumane,' noting injuries to children and livestock in the area. 'All we have here is a bridge connecting villages and farms,' he explained, adding that people now face an extra 10 kilometers of travel to reach Homs.The post Israeli Airstrikes on Lebanon-Syria Border Crossings Spark Major Disruptions first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-airstrikes-lebanon-syria-border-crossings-disruptions/	2024-10-28T03:28:01-07:00	
Breaking: Israeli Strikes in South Lebanon Kill at Least 21 on Su...	The Lebanese health ministry reported that Israeli strikes on Sunday resulted in at least 21 fatalities across southern Lebanon. In Haret Saida, located near Sidon’s port city, nine individuals lost their lives and 38 were injured, the ministry confirmed. Additionally, seven people—including a nurse and three emergency workers—were killed in the southern village of Ain Baal, while another five died in Burj al-Shemali. A strike in Haret Saida, roughly 60 kilometers from the Israeli border, leveled the top floor of a three-story building, according to an AFP correspondent. Nearby structures sustained damage, and the Lebanese army has since restricted access to the area, now populated by civilians fleeing other regions of southern Lebanon amid Israel’s ongoing offensive against Hezbollah, which began in September. According to AFP, no evacuation warning was issued before the strike. In Ain Baal, among the deceased were three rescue workers from an Al-Riossala Association center, a charity affiliated with the Amal political party, a Hezbollah ally. A nurse and three other bystanders were also killed in this attack, the health ministry reported. In Burj al-Shemali, an Israeli drone strike near a school managed by the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) claimed additional lives. The local municipal leader, quoted by ANI news agency, confirmed that the UNRWA school itself was not directly hit and reported no injuries there. As of now, at least 1,620 individuals have died since the conflict began on September 23, based on health ministry figures compiled by AFP.The post Breaking: Israeli Strikes in South Lebanon Kill at Least 21 on Sunday first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strikes-south-lebanon-kill-21-sunday/	2024-10-28T03:08:05-07:00	
Iran Guards Chief Warns Israel of ‘Bitter Consequences’ After Att...	Iran’s top Revolutionary Guards commander has warned Israel of severe repercussions following its recent airstrikes on Iranian military sites, according to local media on Monday. Hossein Salami, the head of the Revolutionary Guards, told Tasnim news agency that Israel’s air raids on Saturday 'failed to achieve their harmful objectives.' The strikes were reportedly a response to Tehran’s missile attack on October 1, which itself came after Iranian-backed militant leaders and a Guards commander were killed. Salami called the Israeli operation a display of 'miscalculation and desperation,' noting that Israel is simultaneously facing militants in Gaza and Lebanon allied with Tehran. He cautioned that the consequences for Israel 'will be unimaginable.' Iranian media, however, have downplayed the impact of Israel’s strikes, suggesting that Iran may be cautious about escalating tensions further. On Sunday, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei commented that the Israeli attacks, which resulted in the death of four soldiers, 'should neither be exaggerated nor minimized,' describing the operation as a 'miscalculation.' President Masoud Pezeshkian also affirmed Iran’s stance, stating, 'We do not seek war but will defend our nation’s rights.' He added that Iran 'will deliver an appropriate response to the aggression by the Zionist regime.' In a similar tone, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi confirmed Iran's 'right to respond,' adding that Tehran had 'received indications' before the Israeli attack took place. A U.S. news source, Axios, reported on Saturday that Israel had 'sent a message to Iran' ahead of the strikes, cautioning against any form of retaliation.The post Iran Guards Chief Warns Israel of ‘Bitter Consequences’ After Attack first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/iran-guards-chief-warns-bitter-consequences-attack/	2024-10-28T03:07:52-07:00	
Israeli Strike on Tyre Leaves 5 Dead, 10 Injured	Lebanon's health ministry reported that an Israeli airstrike hit the southern city of Tyre on Monday, resulting in at least five fatalities and injuring 10 more. According to the health ministry's statement, the 'Israeli enemy's strike this morning on a building' in Tyre's city center 'currently stands at five dead and 10 wounded,' with efforts ongoing to clear the debris. An AFP video journalist on the scene captured footage of emergency teams transporting a survivor on a stretcher to an ambulance while others worked to extinguish a significant fire at the site, where a residential building had collapsed. Tyre, an ancient coastal city home to a UNESCO World Heritage site, endured intense Israeli airstrikes last week, which left large portions of the city center in ruins. Last month, Israel ramped up its airstrikes on Hezbollah-controlled areas and deployed ground forces into Lebanon, following a year of cross-border hostilities with the Iran-backed group amid the ongoing Gaza conflict.The post Israeli Strike on Tyre Leaves 5 Dead, 10 Injured first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strike-tyre-5-dead-10-injured/	2024-10-28T03:07:41-07:00	
Analisys: Israel Ready to Risk Civilian Lives to Hit Single Targe...	On Sunday, a Lebanese family gathering was shattered by an Israeli airstrike that leveled their building. Sixty-year-old Hecham al-Baba was visiting his sister, Donize, who insisted he stay for lunch and even encouraged him to invite an old friend over for coffee. Shortly after he entered the bathroom to freshen up, an explosion shook the building, sending al-Baba to the floor as he struggled to breathe. Moments later, a second blast hit, collapsing the ceiling and trapping him under the rubble. The building, located in Ain el Delb near Sidon, had toppled down a hillside, trapping 17 families and leaving at least 70 dead and 60 injured. Israel reported that the strike was aimed at a Hezbollah commander and claimed the building was a Hezbollah site. However, it has not been confirmed if any of the residents had connections to Hezbollah. A photo circulated online showing one of the building’s residents wearing military fatigues, suggesting possible ties to the group, but residents denied any knowledge of Hezbollah members among them. This incident reflects Israel’s intensified campaign, which has targeted both Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon following the October 7 attack by Hamas. Since late September, Israeli strikes have killed over 2,000 people in Lebanon, including many civilians, in what has been a campaign to dismantle Hezbollah’s presence in the area. Rights groups have raised concerns about the high number of civilian casualties, especially in strikes on homes without clear warnings. Trapped under debris for hours, al-Baba listened in helpless silence, realizing his sister’s family was likely gone. When rescuers finally reached him, they extracted him through a narrow hole. His sister, her husband, and two of their children did not survive. For other residents, such as retired officer Abdul-Hamid Ramadan, who lost his wife and daughter, the grief is immense. 'I lost my wife, my partner, my joy,' Ramadan shared. Families buried the victims in unmarked graves nearby. Israeli strikes, often aimed at possible Hezbollah affiliates, have left Lebanese citizens fearful of hosting anyone who might attract Israeli fire. Human Rights Watch highlighted concerns about entire buildings being destroyed in densely populated areas, exacerbating risks to civilians. Despite evacuations being issued for some areas, many strikes come without warning. Reflecting on the tragedy, al-Baba, now coping with both physical and emotional wounds, vowed he would wear black to mourn his loss. 'There will be no peace,' he lamented, looking back on his shattered family and the ongoing conflicts in Lebanon and Gaza.The post Analisys: Israel Ready to Risk Civilian Lives to Hit Single Target first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-risk-civilian-lives-hit-single-target/	2024-10-28T03:07:29-07:00	
Egypt Proposes 2-Day Gaza Ceasefire, Hostage Release	Egypt’s president has put forward a proposal for a two-day cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, aimed at the release of four hostages held in Gaza. The plan also includes provisions for the release of some Palestinian prisoners and the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza, according to President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who emphasized that the proposal seeks to 'move the situation forward.' The ongoing talks, supported by Qatar and other mediators, aim to make the cease-fire lasting. Efforts for a longer, phased cease-fire have been slow to progress, largely due to Hamas’ demand for Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza as a precondition. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has maintained that forces will remain until Hamas is defeated. There has not been a cease-fire since a temporary one in November, early in the conflict. On Sunday, Israel’s Mossad chief traveled to Doha for talks with Qatar’s prime minister and the CIA director, continuing efforts to resolve the conflict and reduce rising regional tensions following Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel. The situation now involves Israel in conflicts with both Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, with recent Israeli strikes also targeting Iran. At a recent memorial marking the Hebrew anniversary of the October 7 attack, Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant noted that 'not every goal can be achieved through only military operations' and stressed that 'painful compromises will be required' to secure the return of the hostages. During the event, Prime Minister Netanyahu’s speech was interrupted by protesters who criticized his handling of security and the hostage situation, accusing him of responsibility. Inside Gaza, recent Israeli airstrikes in the northern region killed at least 33 people, mostly women and children, according to Palestinian officials, as Israel’s offensive in the heavily impacted area continued into its third week. The U.N. secretary-general has described the situation for Palestinians there as 'unbearable,' while Israel stated its strikes were aimed at militants.The post Egypt Proposes 2-Day Gaza Ceasefire, Hostage Release first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/egypt-proposes-2-day-gaza-ceasefire-hostage-release/	2024-10-28T03:06:58-07:00	
Breaking: Israel Claims 3 Top Hezbollah Leaders Killed in Souther...	The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported on Sunday, October 27, that three high-ranking Hezbollah commanders were killed in southern Lebanon. 'The Israel Air Force (IAF) neutralized Ahmed Jafar Maatouk, the Commander of Hezbollah’s Bint Jbeil Area,' the IDF said. 'The following day, his successor, along with Hezbollah’s head of artillery in Bint Jbeil, were also eliminated.' According to the IDF, these commanders were responsible for orchestrating numerous attacks from the Bint Jbeil region, using anti-tank missiles against Israeli civilians and IDF forces stationed in southern Lebanon. In addition to recent airstrikes on Iranian positions, Israel ramped up its strikes against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon on Sunday. The IDF stated it had killed 70 Hezbollah fighters, hit 120 targets in southern Lebanon, and conducted 'precision strikes' on weapon manufacturing and storage sites in southern Beirut, a Hezbollah stronghold. The ongoing conflict since September 23 has reportedly led to at least 1,615 deaths in Lebanon, based on AFP's count from official sources, though the actual toll may be higher. In response, Hezbollah confirmed it launched rockets at an Israeli military base in northern Israel on Sunday, following its declaration the day prior that certain areas were now 'legitimate targets' due to Israeli military activity. The Iran-backed group claimed to have fired a 'large rocket salvo' at a 'military industries base' north of Haifa, following an evacuation warning issued on Saturday for a large section of northern Israel.The post Breaking: Israel Claims 3 Top Hezbollah Leaders Killed in Southern Lebanon Strikes first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-3-hezbollah-leaders-killed-lebanon-strikes/	2024-10-27T08:32:20-07:00	
Israeli Strike Kills Multiple Civilians Sheltering in School Near...	An Israeli airstrike hit the Asmaa school west of Gaza City, resulting in multiple fatalities, Gaza’s Civil Defense reported. Video from the scene showed several casualties, including two children and others appearing lifeless on the ground. The Hamas-led Government Media Office later confirmed that three of those killed were associated with Hamas-affiliated media. Civil Defense teams were able to retrieve several bodies and injured individuals, and rescuers continue to search for those trapped beneath the rubble. The Al-Shati refugee camp’s school compound, which shelters hundreds of displaced people, has reportedly been struck multiple times. CNN has requested a statement from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) about the incident. Previously, the IDF stated that it targets Hamas operatives in such areas because Hamas places its infrastructure within civilian regions deliberately. Meanwhile, renewed Israeli military activity in northern Gaza has caused further displacement and casualties, with aid cut off in some areas, according to Gaza officials. The UN’s human rights chief has described the ongoing conflict in northern Gaza as reaching its 'darkest moment.'The post Israeli Strike Kills Multiple Civilians Sheltering in School Near Gaza City first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strike-kills-civilians-school-gaza-city/	2024-10-27T08:31:38-07:00	
Dozens Injured as Truck Hits Bus Stop Near Tel Aviv	Israeli emergency services and police reported that a truck crashed into a bus stop near Tel Aviv on Sunday, injuring multiple people. The incident happened close to the Mossad headquarters and near a major highway junction, coinciding with Israelis returning to work after a weeklong holiday. Israeli police spokesperson Asi Aharoni informed public broadcaster Kan that the 'attacker was neutralized,' indicating police are treating the incident as a deliberate attack, though it remains unclear if the suspect was apprehended or killed. The Magen David Adom emergency service responded to the crash site on Aharon Yariv Boulevard in Ramat Hasharon at 10:08 am, providing medical care to dozens. Later, at least 16 people were taken to hospitals for further treatment, and police confirmed that several individuals sustained injuries. Footage from the scene showed police securing the area as medics attended to the injured, with a helicopter providing aerial support. This incident comes as Israel marks the anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attack last year, which led to ongoing conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon.The post Dozens Injured as Truck Hits Bus Stop Near Tel Aviv first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/dozens-injured-truck-bus-stop-tel-aviv/	2024-10-27T08:07:31-07:00	
Khamenei: Israel Attack ‘Shouldn’t Be Exaggerated or Downplayed’	Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stated on Sunday that Israel's recent attack on Iran 'should not be exaggerated or downplayed.' In a post on X, Khamenei referred to the attack as 'the evil perpetrated by the Zionist regime two nights ago' and labeled it a 'miscalculation,' without providing further details. On Saturday, Israel launched airstrikes targeting military sites in Iran, responding to Iran’s October 1 missile assault, which was in retaliation for the killing of Iran-backed militant leaders and a Revolutionary Guards commander. The strikes reportedly killed at least four Iranian soldiers and caused 'limited damage' to radar systems, according to Iranian sources. While the Israeli military cautioned Tehran against further action, Iranian officials have downplayed the strikes, emphasizing Iran’s defensive strength but stopping short of promising a direct retaliation. President Masoud Pezeshkian honored the fallen soldiers, commending their courage in 'defending their land without fear.'The post Khamenei: Israel Attack ‘Shouldn’t Be Exaggerated or Downplayed’ first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/khamenei-israel-attack-shouldnt-exaggerated-downplayed/	2024-10-27T08:07:20-07:00

Netanyahu: Strikes on Iran Achieved Israel’s Goals	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated on Sunday that recent strikes had 'severely damaged' Iran’s defense capabilities and missile production aimed at Israel, claiming the operation met all of Israel's objectives. 'The air force struck targets across Iran,' he said, marking his first public remarks on the mission. Satellite images revealed significant damage to two undisclosed Iranian military bases. One site was reportedly linked to Iran’s nuclear weapon development, which Western intelligence and inspectors say was halted in 2003, while the other was tied to Iran’s ballistic missile program. Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, responded, saying it was up to Iranian authorities to decide how best to show the nation’s strength and protect its interests against Israel. Khamenei holds ultimate authority over any response from Iran. Later that day, Netanyahu faced criticism from the audience while delivering a speech at a memorial event for victims of last year's Hamas attack on southern Israel. Protesters interrupted, shouting 'Shame on you,' which forced Netanyahu to pause. Many Israelis hold him accountable for the attack's failures and for not yet securing the release of remaining hostages.The post Netanyahu: Strikes on Iran Achieved Israel’s Goals first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/strikes-iran-achieved-israels-goals/	2024-10-27T08:06:47-07:00	
Israeli Strike on Haret Saida Leaves 8 Dead, 25 Injured	The Lebanese health ministry reported that at least eight people were killed and 25 others injured on Sunday following an Israeli airstrike near Sidon in southern Lebanon, targeting a building in a densely populated area. The strike hit Haret Saida, a suburb of Sidon that had recently received families fleeing from areas further south, marking the first attack in this location since the onset of the Israel-Hezbollah conflict last month. Initially, the ministry reported two casualties but later confirmed the toll had risen to eight, including a child. According to an AFP correspondent, the strike destroyed an apartment in a three-story residential building, causing damage to nearby shops and buildings. Emergency responders rushed to the scene to assist survivors. While the Israeli military issued evacuation warnings for multiple areas in southern Lebanon, Haret Saida was not identified among the locations expected to be targeted. Reports from Arab TV channels indicated that Hezbollah security official Hussein Fneish was the intended target and that most casualties were members of his family. Since the conflict began on September 23, at least 1,615 people have lost their lives in Lebanon, according to an AFP count based on health ministry data, though the actual toll is likely higher due to incomplete figures. The U.N. migration agency estimates that more than 1.3 million people have been displaced, with over 800,000 of them relocating within Lebanon and more than 500,000 crossing into Syria, mainly Syrian nationals.The post Israeli Strike on Haret Saida Leaves 8 Dead, 25 Injured first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strike-haret-saida-leaves-8-dead-25-injured/	2024-10-27T08:06:30-07:00	
Israel Concludes Strikes on Iranian Missile Sites and Air Defense...	Daylight has arrived in Iran following a series of Israeli airstrikes that lasted several hours. Israel's military stated that these strikes, now completed, were in response to Iran's recent ballistic missile attacks on Israel in early October and back in April. Israel’s defense forces issued a warning to Iran, signaling that they are prepared to defend their citizens as concerns grow that this long-standing conflict could expand into a larger regional war, potentially involving the United States. The strikes targeted facilities used to produce missiles that have been launched at Israel over the past year. It remains uncertain if these sites were also producing missiles for Iranian-aligned groups, including Hezbollah, Hamas, and Houthi rebels in Yemen. Regional tensions have escalated since Israel's invasion of Gaza more than a year ago. Israel also reported hitting Iranian air defense positions early Saturday to clear the way for its aircraft to reach the intended targets. 'The Israel Defense Forces conducted precise strikes on military sites across several regions in Iran. Our aircraft have safely returned,' the Israeli military announced. Iran’s state news agency, IRNA, confirmed strikes on military sites in Tehran, Ilam, and Khuzestan provinces, noting that its air defenses responded effectively, limiting damage. 'Details of this incident are under investigation,' IRNA reported. Earlier, videos shared by Tehran residents captured explosions and tracer fire lighting up the pre-dawn sky. Later broadcasts showed life resuming in Tehran with regular traffic and activity. The decision for Israel’s early Saturday strike followed weeks of internal discussions within Israel’s security cabinet regarding the scale and timing of the operation, according to Israeli sources. The U.S. had reportedly advised Israel to avoid targeting Iran’s energy infrastructure to prevent sparking a wider conflict, a request Israel appeared to honor, based on early reports. 'This should conclude this direct exchange between Israel and Iran,' stated a senior U.S. administration official after the strikes.The post Israel Concludes Strikes on Iranian Missile Sites and Air Defenses – What We Know first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-strikes-iranian-missile-sites-defenses/	2024-10-25T23:58:16-07:00	
Biden Urged Netanyahu to Plan Iran Retaliation to Deter Future At...	U.S. President Joe Biden reportedly urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a phone call last week to develop a counterattack against Iran that would discourage future strikes on Israel, according to a senior U.S. administration official. American officials anticipated an Israeli response against Iran before November 5, a date that would highlight the escalating tensions in the Middle East just ahead of the U.S. presidential election. 'The President discussed the broader situation with Prime Minister Netanyahu and last week encouraged a response strategy that would both deter additional attacks on Israel and limit escalation risks. That remains our goal, as well as Israel’s, as they stated this evening,' said the official. The official added that the U.S. is prepared to defend against any potential retaliatory moves from Iran. Biden’s call to Netanyahu on October 17 came while en route to Germany, during which he addressed the recent killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Both President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have been briefed on Israel’s retaliatory actions and are closely monitoring the unfolding situation, as previously reported by CNN.The post Biden Urged Netanyahu to Plan Iran Retaliation to Deter Future Attacks, Says Senior US Official first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/biden-netanyahu-iran-retaliation-deter-attacks/	2024-10-25T23:57:50-07:00	
Blinken: UN Peacekeeper Safety in Lebanon ‘Essential’	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken emphasized to Lebanon's prime minister on Friday the importance of safeguarding U.N. peacekeepers stationed in Lebanon, following reports of continued Israeli firing in the region, the State Department announced. During their meeting in London, Blinken expressed his commitment to supporting the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and stressed that protecting their personnel is crucial, according to the statement from the State Department. UNIFIL reported on Friday that Israeli forces had fired at one of their observation posts in southern Lebanon earlier in the week. The force noted that the security situation remains 'extremely challenging' amid other, unidentified attacks. On Tuesday, UNIFIL stated that 'IDF soldiers fired at' an observation post near the border village of Dhayra, causing the guards to retreat to ensure their safety.The post Blinken: UN Peacekeeper Safety in Lebanon ‘Essential’ first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/un-peacekeeper-safety-lebanon-essential/	2024-10-25T23:57:37-07:00

Agency spokesperson Mahmud Bassal stated, 'Civil defense teams retrieved 12 bodies and assisted multiple injured individuals after Israeli drones targeted a group of civilians and a vehicle waiting for aid.' The strikes reportedly took place near the Shati refugee camp in western Gaza City.

Lebanon Placed on Money Laundering ‘Grey List’	The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global entity dedicated to combating money laundering, announced Friday that Lebanon has been added to its 'grey list' for increased scrutiny of its financial transactions. Lebanon’s inclusion comes as it faces ongoing Israeli airstrikes. Alongside Lebanon, the FATF also added Algeria, Angola, and Ivory Coast to this list. Elisa de Anda Madrazo of Mexico, currently leading the FATF, acknowledged Lebanon’s challenging circumstances. 'Lebanon’s grey list status is not intended to disrupt humanitarian relief efforts,' she emphasized, adding that FATF is committed to ensuring humanitarian aid can still flow to the country. Madrazo clarified that the grey list designation is not a punitive action but rather a part of the FATF’s efforts to support countries in improving financial regulatory measures. Additionally, she noted that Lebanon would be granted some flexibility regarding the deadlines in its assigned action plan. On a positive note, Senegal has been removed from the grey list after showing progress, particularly in its capacity to investigate and prosecute money laundering tied to corruption. The FATF did not update its 'black list' of countries requiring heightened international countermeasures, which includes Iran, Myanmar, and North Korea.The post Lebanon Placed on Money Laundering ‘Grey List’ first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/lebanon-placed-money-laundering-grey-list/	2024-10-25T23:57:16-07:00	
Israel Launches Strikes on Military Targets in Iran	In response to a ballistic missile attack from Iran on October 1, Israel launched targeted airstrikes early Saturday on what it described as Iranian military sites. No immediate details emerged regarding the extent of the damage in Iran. The strike had been anticipated by Israel, which had repeatedly signaled its intent to respond as regional tensions have continued to mount. Over a year after the initial attack by Hamas on Israel, the region remains on edge. Israel has since intensified its military campaigns in Gaza and expanded into Lebanon, aiming at militant groups supported by Iran. Israel’s military released a statement describing the strikes as 'precise attacks on military targets in Iran,' without providing further specifics. The statement added, 'Iran’s regime and its regional proxies have continued assaults on Israel since October 7&#8230;including direct attacks from Iranian soil.' In Tehran, residents reported hearing at least seven loud explosions. State media acknowledged the sounds, attributing some to air defense systems responding near the capital. International flights began redirecting around western Iran as news of the strikes spread, according to flight-tracking data. Meanwhile, Syrian state media reported that their air defenses were also responding to 'hostile targets.' In recent months, Iran has launched two missile attacks against Israel, following the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas that erupted after Hamas’s October 7 assault on Israel, which reportedly killed around 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Since then, more than 42,000 Palestinians have lost their lives in Gaza, according to local health authorities, with hundreds more killed in Israeli military actions in the West Bank. Israel’s campaign has also extended into Lebanon with ground invasions and extensive airstrikes. The timing of the latest Israeli strike coincided with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s return from a Middle Eastern tour, where U.S. officials cautioned Israel to avoid exacerbating regional tensions and to exclude Iranian nuclear facilities from any potential strikes. White House National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett stated, 'We understand that Israel is targeting military sites in Iran' but deferred to Israeli authorities for additional details. U.S. officials confirmed that Israel had notified Washington of its plans, although the U.S. was not involved in the operation. The conflict between Israel and Iran, ongoing since Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution, has seen frequent clashes in recent years, with Israel citing Iran’s support for militant groups and its nuclear ambitions as primary concerns. In response to escalating Iranian missile attacks, particularly the October 1 strike, Israel committed to a forceful retaliation.The post Israel Launches Strikes on Military Targets in Iran first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-launches-strikes-military-targets-iran/	2024-10-25T23:57:07-07:00	
Breaking: Hezbollah Hits Safad; Israel Reports 5 Soldiers Killed ...	Hezbollah announced on Friday that it launched a drone assault on a military base in northern Israel, near the border, following earlier claims of rocket fire targeting the same region. According to Hezbollah’s statement, the attack involved 'explosives-laden drones' aimed at the base east of Safad, and shortly before, the group said it had fired 'a salvo of rockets' at the town. Overnight, Israeli warplanes carried out airstrikes on several locations in Beirut’s southern suburbs, including Choueifat, Hadath, Haret Hreik, and Borj al-Barajneh. Five Israeli Soldiers Killed in Southern Lebanon On Friday, the Israeli army reported that five soldiers were killed and two severely injured in combat in southern Lebanon. This brings the total of Israeli soldiers killed in Lebanon to 32 since the ground operation began on September 30. Rocket Attack Injures Three in Israel’s Majd Al-Krum A rocket attack from Lebanon critically injured three people in Israel’s northern town of Majd Al-Krum, including two men, both aged 21, and a 35-year-old woman. Israeli rescue services reported that six others were injured, including an 80-year-old man in serious condition. According to Israel’s military, the rocket barrage hit a gym in Majd Al-Krum, while 45 projectiles were fired from Lebanon; some were intercepted, while others landed in open areas. Israeli Strikes in Eastern Lebanon Result in 12 Fatalities, Including Three Children On Thursday, Israeli airstrikes in eastern Lebanon killed 12 people, including three children, in two villages. Seven individuals, among them the children, were killed in an airstrike on Al-Khodr village in the Baalbek-Hermel region, with five others killed in another nearby attack. Health Workers and Hospitals Impacted by Israeli Strikes Lebanon’s caretaker Health Minister, Firas Abiad, reported Friday that Israeli strikes over the past year have damaged 55 hospitals, with 36 directly hit, resulting in 12 deaths and 60 injuries. Eight hospitals have been forced to shut down, while seven remain partially functional. Abiad emphasized that paramedics have also been targeted, with 151 deaths and 272 injuries reported among rescue workers. He claimed Israel’s military has prevented recovery of eight paramedics in southern Lebanon, stating that such actions are deliberate attacks on medical personnel, constituting a 'war crime.' Israeli Strike Closes Lebanon-Syria Border Crossing An Israeli airstrike on Friday hit a border crossing between Lebanon and Syria in Qaa, marking the third such border crossing closure. This leaves only three functioning border routes. Previously, an October 5 Israeli airstrike left a large crater on the Lebanese side of the Masnaa crossing, the busiest border route between Lebanon and Syria. In late September, another Israeli airstrike forced the closure of the Matraba crossing in Lebanon’s northeast.The post Breaking: Hezbollah Hits Safad; Israel Reports 5 Soldiers Killed in South Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-hits-safad-israel-5-soldiers-killed-lebanon/	2024-10-25T08:26:44-07:00	
Blinken Meets Mikati, Urges ‘Diplomatic Resolution’ in Lebanon	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken pledged on Friday to push urgently for a diplomatic solution to end Israel's ongoing offensive in Lebanon but emphasized that securing an agreement on Hezbollah's disarmament is essential. During a meeting with Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati in London, Blinken stressed the need for civilian protections but stopped short of calling for an immediate ceasefire. The U.S. remains a key diplomatic and military backer of Israel. 'We’re approaching this with a sense of real urgency to reach a diplomatic solution and fully implement U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, to ensure lasting security along the Israel-Lebanon border,' Blinken told reporters, noting he was 'intensely engaged' in these efforts. Resolution 1701, adopted in 2006 after a previous conflict, calls for the disarmament of non-state forces in Lebanon—primarily referring to Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Shiite group that maintains its own military—and for Israel's full withdrawal from Lebanon. Blinken highlighted the need to establish conditions that allow full implementation of the resolution, adding, 'The sooner we secure these understandings, the sooner we can reach a resolution.' He urged efforts to safeguard civilians and Lebanese soldiers, at least 11 of whom have died since the Israeli offensive began a month ago. 'It’s important that in places like Beirut, real measures are taken to protect civilians and avoid unnecessary harm,' he said. The U.S. has advocated for strengthening Lebanon’s central government and its military to assume full responsibility for security, reducing Hezbollah’s influence. Prime Minister Mikati, who was in Paris on Thursday for a Lebanon support conference, reaffirmed that only Lebanon’s state and army should bear arms. Jordan’s Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi, also meeting with Blinken, noted Lebanon’s government has committed to upholding Resolution 1701, adding, 'The aggression against Lebanon must stop immediately. There’s no justification for its continuation.'The post Blinken Meets Mikati, Urges ‘Diplomatic Resolution’ in Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/blinken-mikati-urges-diplomatic-resolution-lebanon/	2024-10-25T08:25:54-07:00	
UK Delivers Critical Food and Medical Aid to Lebanese Army	The UK has supplied over 12,500 ration packs and 79 battlefield medical kits to support the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF), delivered by the RAF and funded by the UK’s Integrated Security Fund. The British Embassy in Beirut highlighted the importance of the LAF, noting its role as the sole legitimate military force in Lebanon and a crucial element for the country’s security. The UK has provided critical support to the LAF for over a decade, including training more than 34,000 personnel and investing over £106 million in the force. Additionally, the UK has assisted in building nearly 80 border observation posts and operating bases to strengthen Lebanon's border security. British officials, including the Prime Minister, Foreign Secretary, and Defense Secretary, are also calling for an immediate ceasefire and increased humanitarian aid in Lebanon and Gaza to facilitate a political solution. The UK has urged British nationals to leave Lebanon, arranging charter flights to assist in their safe departure. Defense Secretary John Healey commented, 'This RAF supply delivery is a direct response to the LAF's request, supporting Lebanon's stability as part of our peace efforts in the region.' Foreign Secretary David Lammy emphasized, 'This support reflects our commitment to Lebanon’s legitimate armed forces, which are essential for stability in the region. We are also pressing for a ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel and a political approach consistent with U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701.' In response to increased displacement and civilian impact, the UK has allocated an additional £10 million for humanitarian assistance in Lebanon. This is in addition to a £5 million package delivered through UNICEF for essential services and public donations matched by the UK government for the DEC Middle East Humanitarian Appeal up to £10 million. The British Embassy reaffirmed the UK's commitment to peace in the Middle East and called for de-escalation, advocating for a ceasefire to enable civilians to return safely to their homes.The post UK Delivers Critical Food and Medical Aid to Lebanese Army first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/uk-delivers-food-medical-aid-lebanese-army/	2024-10-25T08:25:43-07:00	
Breaking: 3 TV Staffers Killed in Israeli Strike on Journalist Co...	An Israeli airstrike targeting a compound in southeast Lebanon, where journalists were stationed, led to the deaths of three media workers, according to Lebanon’s National News Agency on Friday. Footage from local news channel Al-Jadeed showed buildings reduced to rubble and dust-covered vehicles marked 'PRESS.' Reports indicate that the Israeli army did not issue a warning before the airstrike, which struck a cluster of chalets rented by various media organizations. The pan-Arab channel Al-Mayadeen, based in Beirut, confirmed that two of its journalists, Ghassan Najjar and Mohammad Reda, were killed in the attack early Friday. Al-Manar TV also reported the death of its cameraman, Wissam Qassem. The strike occurred in Hasbaya, an area that had largely avoided previous clashes along the border. Since near-daily skirmishes began along the Lebanon-Israel border on October 8, 2023, several journalists have lost their lives.The post Breaking: 3 TV Staffers Killed in Israeli Strike on Journalist Compound in Hasbaya first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/3-tv-staffers-killed-israeli-strike-compound-hasbaya/	2024-10-25T00:51:27-07:00

In a statement, the group claimed its fighters 'bombed' a defense industry base 'north of Haifa' with a series of rockets. Additionally, Hezbollah reported launching a 'large rocket barrage' targeting the northern Israeli town of Safad.

Pentagon Chief Expresses ‘Deep Concern’ Over Israeli Strikes on L...	U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has voiced 'deep concern' to Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over recent strikes on Lebanon’s military, following the deaths of three Lebanese soldiers over the weekend. Lebanon’s army reported on Sunday that an Israeli strike had hit a military vehicle in southern Lebanon, where Israel has been targeting positions associated with Hezbollah, supported by Iran. This incident raised Lebanese troop casualties to eight since conflict between Israel and Hezbollah intensified last month. During a call with Gallant on Wednesday, Austin conveyed his concerns about the reported strikes on Lebanese military forces, according to Pentagon spokesperson Major General Pat Ryder. Austin stressed the need to prioritize the safety of both Lebanese Armed Forces and U.N. peacekeepers in Lebanon, also known as UNIFIL, which has reported multiple recent strikes from Israel. Austin further expressed condolences for the death of Israeli brigade commander Colonel Ahsan Daksa in northern Gaza. The Israeli military reported that Colonel Daksa was killed by an explosive device while exiting his tank in the Jabalia area on Sunday.The post Pentagon Chief Expresses ‘Deep Concern’ Over Israeli Strikes on Lebanese Army first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/pentagon-deep-concern-israeli-strikes-lebanese-army/	2024-10-25T00:50:05-07:00	
Israel Claims Aid Worker Killed in Strike Was Hamas Commander	Israeli officials have claimed that a UN aid worker killed in central Gaza, Mohammad Abu Etewi, was also a Hamas commander. According to Israel's Defense Forces (IDF) and the Israeli Security Agency, Abu Etewi was allegedly involved in the October 7 attack in Re’im, southern Israel, targeting civilians and abducting hostages. Israel further claimed that, as the conflict continued, he directed assaults on IDF forces. An UNRWA spokesperson confirmed that Abu Etewi’s name appeared on an Israeli-provided list of UNRWA employees allegedly linked to Hamas, but the agency said it has yet to receive further evidence from Israel despite its request for additional details. Israeli authorities also released images that they claim show Abu Etewi participating in the October 7 attack, though CNN could not independently verify these photos. Meanwhile, Abu Etewi’s family members told CNN he was uninvolved in any militant activities, describing him as a UN employee focused on transporting aid to those in need. His father, Marwan Abu Etewi, stated that Mohammad was not a fighter and had no ties to Hamas.The post Israel Claims Aid Worker Killed in Strike Was Hamas Commander first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-aid-worker-killed-strike-hamas-commander/	2024-10-25T00:49:54-07:00	
Mikati Calls for Immediate Ceasefire, 8,000 Troops Deployed in So...	On Thursday, caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati called for an immediate ceasefire and the full enforcement of the U.N. resolution that ended the last conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. He also proposed deploying 8,000 Lebanese troops to a buffer zone along the Israeli border. Speaking at a conference in Paris in support of Lebanon, Mikati emphasized the devastating toll the ongoing war has taken on Lebanon, describing the widespread destruction and human suffering it has caused. 'The Israeli aggression has resulted in immense human loss and has severely damaged our infrastructure, economy, and social fabric,' he stated. Mikati expressed regret that civilian lives and destruction could have been avoided if Israel had agreed to the joint statement issued on September 25. He reiterated Lebanon’s call for an immediate ceasefire and urged the deployment of Lebanese forces south of the Litani River to enforce peace. 'What Lebanon needs most today is an instant ceasefire, and we are counting on your pressure to make this happen,' he told the international community. Though the Lebanese Army has largely stayed out of the latest conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, it claims Israeli forces have targeted its soldiers eight times, resulting in deaths and injuries. Israel apologized for a fatal strike on Sunday. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, called for the withdrawal of Hezbollah and Israeli forces from areas south of Lebanon’s Litani River, leaving control to the Lebanese Army and U.N. peacekeepers. Israel has argued that the resolution was never fully enforced, accusing Hezbollah of building military infrastructure up to the border. Lebanon, in turn, has criticized Israel for violating provisions like infringing on its airspace. The Lebanese Army has around 80,000 personnel, with about 5,000 stationed in the south. Representing the army at the Paris conference, Brig. Gen. Youssef Haddad said Lebanon is recruiting an additional 1,500 soldiers to help implement the U.N. resolution. Hezbollah, which boasts tens of thousands of fighters, remains a powerful force, and Lebanon’s military lacks the strength to confront the group or resist an Israeli ground invasion.The post Mikati Calls for Immediate Ceasefire, 8,000 Troops Deployed in South first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/mikati-calls-ceasefire-8000-troops-deployed-south/	2024-10-24T05:05:08-07:00

Egypt, US, Qatar Discuss Limited Gaza Ceasefire and Hostage Relea...	Egypt has floated the idea of a temporary halt in fighting, during which Hamas could release a few hostages and humanitarian aid could be increased, particularly in northern Gaza, according to an Egyptian official who spoke to The Associated Press. The official, who requested anonymity due to not being authorized to speak to the media, noted that Egypt and Qatar had discussed the plan with the United States, although it has not yet become a concrete proposal. Both Israel and Hamas are reportedly aware of these discussions. A senior official from the U.S. State Department confirmed that the notion of a limited hostage release has been raised recently, but no final decision has been made, even following U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's meetings with Israeli officials and hostage families. As of now, neither Israel nor Hamas has commented on the proposal. Historically, Hamas has dismissed similar suggestions, maintaining its focus on achieving an end to the war. The group is still holding around 100 hostages from its October 7, 2023, attack, with approximately a third believed to be deceased.The post Egypt, US, Qatar Discuss Limited Gaza Ceasefire and Hostage Release first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/egypt-us-qatar-limited-gaza-ceasefire-hostage-release/	2024-10-24T01:27:08-07:00	
Israel Claims Iran Strike Would Prove Military Readiness	Israel's defense minister, Yoav Gallant, addressed a group of air force pilots on Wednesday, stating that an Israeli strike on Iran would showcase the 'preparation and readiness' of the nation's air force. 'After we carry out an attack in Iran, both within Israel and elsewhere, people will understand the extent of your preparation and readiness,' Gallant said while speaking to pilots and operators at the Hatzerim airbase in southern Israel. He emphasized that the Air Force plays a crucial role, warning that 'anyone who tries to harm us will be harmed.' This statement is the latest indication from Israeli leadership that the country is preparing to respond forcefully to Iran following the ballistic missile attack on Israel on October 1. Israel's potential options for retaliation range from symbolic strikes on military sites to more significant actions, such as targeting Iran’s vital oil infrastructure or its closely guarded nuclear program. U.S. President Joe Biden has advised Israel against such extensive actions.The post Israel Claims Iran Strike Would Prove Military Readiness first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-iran-strike-prove-military-readiness/	2024-10-24T01:26:58-07:00	
Israel Prepared for Multi-Front War Lasting ‘Months’	The Israeli army is ready to continue its operations in Gaza and Lebanon for an extended period, potentially lasting months, according to a senior Israeli security official on Wednesday during a media briefing. 'We are prepared for months, and we will remain for as long as necessary to ensure Israel's security,' the source said, referring to the ongoing military activities in both regions. Israel has also pledged to respond to a missile attack by Iran earlier this month. The official emphasized that Israel is not waging a conventional war against Gaza or Lebanon but rather confronting militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah, both backed by Iran. 'This is a war against Iran, sometimes directly and sometimes indirectly, through its proxies,' the source explained. The Israeli military claims to have 'eliminated the entire command structure' of Hamas and Hezbollah and significantly reduced their military strength. The conflict in Gaza began with Hamas' attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, reportedly resulting in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli figures. In response, Israel's retaliatory strikes have caused 42,792 fatalities in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry. Last month, Israel escalated its operations in Lebanon following cross-border rocket attacks by Hezbollah in support of Hamas. The Israeli government has committed to securing its northern border to facilitate the return of displaced Israelis. Since October 7, 29 Israeli soldiers have been killed in confrontations with Hezbollah, while 358 have died in Gaza. The security official stated that Israel's goal is to weaken these militant groups as much as possible. In Gaza, the operation is largely focused on counter-insurgency efforts, with Hamas reportedly having around 1,000 fighters and up to 100 rockets capable of reaching Tel Aviv, though these figures have not been independently verified. Israel has intensified airstrikes on Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon and deployed ground forces. The ongoing conflict has led to the deaths of at least 1,552 people in Lebanon since September 23, according to Lebanese health ministry figures. Despite the military actions, Israel hopes for a more stable Lebanon after the conflict. The source cited U.N. Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah and called for the Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeepers to take control of areas near the Israeli border. Israel supports enforcing this resolution but insists on the ability to ensure its implementation. The situation in Gaza, the source noted, remains more complicated, and the Israeli army will continue its operations 'for as long as necessary' until security is guaranteed. Only then will Israel consider its next steps.The post Israel Prepared for Multi-Front War Lasting ‘Months’ first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-prepared-multi-front-war-lasting-months/	2024-10-24T01:26:47-07:00	
Geagea: Hochstein Proposals Violate Sovereignty, Gov’t Must Enfor...	Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea on Wednesday urged the government to publicly affirm its commitment to U.N. resolutions, particularly Resolution 1559, to prevent the situation in Lebanon from worsening. He also expressed concerns that some of the proposals by U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein infringe on Lebanon's sovereignty. In an interview with Al-Arabiya, Geagea stated that 'the ongoing conflict in Lebanon is essentially between Israel and Iran,' and called on the government to actively implement U.N. Resolutions 1559, 1680, and 1701, rather than simply committing to them. Geagea criticized Speaker Nabih Berri and caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati, accusing them of resisting the implementation of Resolutions 1559 and 1680, and only making superficial efforts regarding Resolution 1701. He stressed that this is no time for political maneuvering and urged the government to fulfill the terms of the Taif Agreement. 'Lebanon is at a critical juncture, and we need courageous and decisive action,' Geagea emphasized. He also revealed that both Berri and Mikati are reluctant to demand that Hezbollah disarm, and shared that he had advised the prime minister months ago to confront Hezbollah and warn them about the potential for war. Geagea further suggested that had the Lebanese Army been positioned at the border, Israel might not have launched its attacks on Lebanon.The post Geagea: Hochstein Proposals Violate Sovereignty, Gov’t Must Enforce Resolution 1559 first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hochstein-violate-sovereignty-govt-enforce-resolution-1559/	2024-10-24T01:26:21-07:00	
Western Diplomat: Foreign Troops Possible in Lebanon Post-Truce	Western nations are discussing the possibility of deploying international forces to Lebanon alongside the country's military in the event of a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, according to a Western diplomat on Wednesday. Currently, around 10,000 United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) peacekeepers are stationed in southern Lebanon, but there are considerations for a separate multinational force to be deployed. 'What is needed now is a ceasefire and a presence that both sides trust. This could involve the Lebanese army with international forces,' the diplomat told AFP, under the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue. Lebanon’s allies have been supporting the Lebanese army and are exploring how they can provide further assistance in the context of a ceasefire and a long-term diplomatic solution, the diplomat added. Following nearly a year of conflict with Hamas in Gaza, Israel shifted its attention to Lebanon last month, aiming to secure its northern border amidst ongoing attacks from Hezbollah. Israel has intensified airstrikes on Hezbollah strongholds and deployed ground forces. The U.N. Security Council’s Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, called for the deployment of only Lebanese government forces and UNIFIL peacekeepers in southern Lebanon. However, it has faced criticism for limited implementation. Lebanese media have reported discussions about strengthening the resolution, with some referring to the potential plan as '1701-plus.' During a visit to Beirut on Monday, U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein emphasized that merely committing to Resolution 1701 would not be sufficient, suggesting the need for additional measures to ensure its proper implementation. The Western diplomat said that the push for a '1701-plus' reflects the fact that neither side has fully implemented the original resolution. Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati has also expressed Lebanon's readiness to strengthen the army's presence in the south after a ceasefire is reached. UNIFIL, established in 1978 to monitor the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon, has recently accused Israel of repeatedly and deliberately targeting its positions. Hezbollah, formed after Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, is the only group that retained its weapons after Lebanon's civil war (1975-1990), claiming its arms are necessary for resisting Israel. A previous U.N.-mandated multinational force, including troops from the U.S. and France, was deployed to Lebanon after the 1982 Israeli invasion. However, it was targeted in two deadly attacks that claimed nearly 300 lives.The post Western Diplomat: Foreign Troops Possible in Lebanon Post-Truce first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/foreign-troops-possible-lebanon-post-truce/	2024-10-24T01:25:47-07:00	
Netanyahu Accuses Hezbollah of Planning Israel Invasion	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed on Wednesday that Israel had uncovered a Hezbollah plot to launch a large-scale assault on the country, using underground tunnels equipped with jeeps and missiles. Speaking to French broadcasters CNews and Europe 1, Netanyahu explained that the plan, if carried out, would have been more devastating than the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023. Netanyahu described how the Israeli military discovered tunnels just 100-200 meters from the border, intended for an invasion of Israel. The tunnels were part of a plan to infiltrate Israel using motorbikes, jeeps, rockets, and missiles. 'They were preparing an attack greater than what we saw on October 7,' Netanyahu said, according to the networks' translation. Earlier this month, Netanyahu had also told *Le Figaro* that the Israeli military had found advanced Russian military equipment among Hezbollah’s arms stockpiles. Since Israel escalated its offensive in Lebanon last month, including airstrikes and ground operations, the conflict has resulted in at least 1,552 deaths, based on Lebanese health ministry figures, though the actual number is likely higher.The post Netanyahu Accuses Hezbollah of Planning Israel Invasion first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/netanyahu-hezbollah-planning-israel-invasion/	2024-10-24T01:25:13-07:00	
Israel Flattens Residential Complex in Dahieh Strikes	Israel launched a series of airstrikes on Hezbollah’s stronghold in southern Beirut on Wednesday night, destroying a residential complex, according to Lebanese state media. The attacks occurred after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, during his visit to Israel, urged the country to avoid further escalating tensions with Iran. Israel is engaged in conflicts with Iran-backed Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, and has vowed to retaliate against Iran following a missile attack on October 1. In Lebanon, the National News Agency (NNA) reported that at least 10 Israeli strikes targeted Beirut’s southern suburbs, following an evacuation warning from the Israeli army. Four of those strikes hit a residential complex near Laylaki, completely destroying it and causing a massive fire. In southern Lebanon, the city of Tyre was heavily bombarded by Israeli airstrikes, leaving large parts of the city center in ruins and triggering a mass exodus. Tyre’s disaster management unit reported that seven buildings were flattened, with over 400 apartments damaged. 'The whole city shook,' said one resident, with black smoke seen rising from several neighborhoods, including areas close to the city’s ancient ruins. UNESCO expressed concern and said it is closely monitoring the impact of the conflict on Tyre’s World Heritage site. Blinken’s visit to the region, his 11th since the Gaza war began, is part of ongoing U.S. efforts to contain the conflict and limit its wider regional implications. He emphasized to Israel that while they have achieved many of their strategic goals in Gaza, it’s crucial they avoid actions that could cause further escalation. The war in Gaza began after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, resulting in the deaths of 1,206 people, mainly civilians, according to Israeli figures. Israel’s retaliation has claimed 42,792 lives in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the health ministry of Gaza, a figure considered reliable by the U.N. Blinken also touched on Israel’s promise to retaliate for Iran's attack on October 1, urging Israel to respond in a way that does not exacerbate tensions. Following his visit to Israel, Blinken traveled to Saudi Arabia in an effort to continue working on a potential diplomatic breakthrough between Israel and the Arab world. In a separate development, Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian called for BRICS nations to help bring an end to the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon during a summit in Russia. Meanwhile, a Hamas delegation arrived in Moscow for talks. Concerns are also mounting for civilians in northern Gaza, where aid remains scarce and the Israeli offensive is ongoing. Displaced Gazans are struggling with cold as winter approaches, with many living in makeshift shelters. Additionally, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed on Wednesday that Hezbollah had been planning a large-scale attack on Israel, similar to Hamas’ assault on October 7, involving jeeps, missiles, and tunnels. Netanyahu said Israel had uncovered the plot in time. Hezbollah confirmed the death of a key cleric, Hashem Safieddine, who had been expected to succeed the group’s current leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. Safieddine’s death was reported a day after the Israeli army announced his demise. There are also discussions among Western diplomats about deploying international forces to Lebanon if a ceasefire is reached. Currently, about 10,000 U.N. peacekeepers are stationed in southern Lebanon, but additional multinational troops are being considered.The post Israel Flattens Residential Complex in Dahieh Strikes first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-flattens-residential-complex-dahieh-strikes/	2024-10-24T01:24:50-07:00

Germany FM Urges Diplomatic Solution During Beirut Visit	German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has called for a diplomatic resolution to the ongoing conflict between Hezbollah and Israel. Upon arriving in Beirut on Wednesday, Baerbock emphasized the need to collaborate with partners in the U.S., Europe, and the Arab world to develop a viable diplomatic solution that addresses the security concerns of both Israel and Lebanon. She warned that a full destabilization of Lebanon would be disastrous for the Middle East's most religiously diverse country and the broader region. Baerbock expressed concern about Lebanon's fragile state, describing the country as 'on the brink of collapse.' She also urged all parties involved in the conflict to ensure the safety of United Nations peacekeepers stationed along the Israeli-Lebanese border, stating that 'any deliberate attack on U.N. peacekeepers violates international humanitarian law.' This marks Baerbock's 12th visit to the region following Hamas' attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.The post Germany FM Urges Diplomatic Solution During Beirut Visit first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/germany-fm-diplomatic-solution-during-beirut-visit/	2024-10-23T02:47:26-07:00	
Israeli Drone Strikes Hit Southern City of Tyre	Lebanese state media reported an Israeli drone strike on a street in Tyre on Wednesday, following warnings from the Israeli army for residents to evacuate large areas of the southern city. According to the National News Agency, 'an enemy drone targeted' a street in Tyre. AFPTV footage captured thick black smoke rising from the city. Earlier that day, Lebanese civilians fled Tyre after the Israeli army issued evacuation warnings ahead of planned military operations. Israeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee shared a map on the social media platform X, highlighting the affected streets and urging residents to 'immediately move out of the area marked in red and head north of the Awali River.' He warned that anyone near Hezbollah members, facilities, or combat equipment was putting their life at risk.The post Israeli Drone Strikes Hit Southern City of Tyre first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-drone-strikes-hit-southern-city-tyre/	2024-10-23T02:47:09-07:00

Smoke, likely from an intercepted projectile, was visible in the sky above the hotel where Blinken was staying. Hezbollah claimed responsibility for firing rockets at an Israeli military intelligence base located in the suburbs of Tel Aviv, following overnight strikes on southern Beirut. In a statement, Hezbollah said its fighters launched a 'rocket salvo' at the Glilot base, which has been targeted multiple times in recent days. The group stated the attack was 'in response to the Zionist enemy's attacks and massacres.' On Tuesday, Hezbollah also launched attack drones targeting an Israeli military base near Haifa and claimed responsibility for striking seven Israeli tanks—five inside Lebanese territory and two across the northern Israeli border.The post Projectiles Intercepted Near Blinken’s Tel Aviv Hotel as Hezbollah Strikes Suburbs first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/projectiles-intercepted-blinkens-tel-aviv-hotel/	2024-10-23T02:46:50-07:00	
10 Dead, 31 Injured in Strikes on Hermel and Nabatiyeh	Two Israeli airstrikes on Tuesday evening resulted in the deaths of at least 10 people in southern and northeastern Lebanon as Israel continues its offensive against Hezbollah targets. According to two separate statements from the ministry, five people were killed and 10 others injured in the northeastern Hermel region near the Syrian border. In another strike, five more were killed and 21 wounded in the southern city of Nabatiyeh, which has been subjected to Israeli attacks for several days.The post 10 Dead, 31 Injured in Strikes on Hermel and Nabatiyeh first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/10-dead-31-injured-strikes-hermel-nabatiyeh/	2024-10-23T02:45:45-07:00	
Breaking: Israel Confirms Safieddine’s Death	The Israeli military announced on Tuesday that one of its airstrikes near Beirut earlier this month had killed a senior Hezbollah official, Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, who was widely regarded as the likely successor to the group’s leadership. Hezbollah has not yet confirmed the death of Safieddine, a prominent cleric within the organization. He was expected to take over leadership following the death of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, one of Hezbollah’s founders, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike in September. According to Israel, Safieddine was killed in an airstrike in early October in a southern suburb of Beirut, along with around 25 other Hezbollah leaders. Recent Israeli strikes have decimated much of Hezbollah's top leadership, causing significant disruption within the organization.The post Breaking: Israel Confirms Safieddine’s Death first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-confirms-safieddines-death/	2024-10-23T02:40:32-07:00	
Watch: France Defends Ban on Israeli Arms Firms, Denies Boycott C...	On Tuesday, the French government defended its decision to prohibit Israeli companies involved in supplying weapons for the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East from exhibiting at an upcoming trade fair near Paris. The naval defense exhibition, Euronaval, scheduled for November 4-7, stated on its website that Israeli firms are allowed to participate, but only if their products are not being used in military operations in Gaza and Lebanon. The organizers said these restrictions were based on decisions made by the French government earlier this month. Speaking to parliament on Tuesday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot clarified that this policy does not equate to a boycott of Israeli companies. However, he explained that it would be inconsistent for France to promote weapons used in these conflicts while simultaneously advocating for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon. Barrot added that the French government has communicated this stance to Israeli authorities, emphasizing that Israeli companies could still participate in the exhibition if their products are not used in the offensive actions in those regions. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, in a post on social media platform X on Sunday, called on French President Emmanuel Macron to reverse the restrictions, describing them as 'unacceptable' and 'anti-democratic.' Katz urged France and the Western world to support Israel rather than oppose it. Despite this, Barrot reaffirmed France’s support for Israel’s right to self-defense. He pointed to France’s continued export of components used in Israel’s 'Iron Dome' air-defense system. However, he stressed that it would be inconsistent to promote weapons used in Gaza and Lebanon, which have caused significant civilian casualties, while France calls for an immediate ceasefire.The post Watch: France Defends Ban on Israeli Arms Firms, Denies Boycott Claims first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/france-defends-ban-israeli-arms-firms-denies-boycott/	2024-10-23T02:39:04-07:00

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Tel Aviv on Tuesday for discussions with Israeli officials as the U.S. continues its efforts to push for a diplomatic resolution to the growing conflict in the Middle East. This marks Blinken’s 11th trip to the region since war broke out last year, and he arrives at a pivotal moment. Israel is preparing its expected response to an Iranian missile attack, while ceasefire negotiations over the conflicts in Lebanon and Gaza seem to have stalled. The visit also comes amid tension between Washington and its key regional ally, Israel. The U.S. has warned that it may halt weapons supplies unless the humanitarian conditions in Gaza improve. Relations were further tested following a recent U.S. intelligence leak regarding Israel’s war strategies. However, the State Department indicated on Monday that the leak would likely not be a topic of discussion during Blinken's meetings. On Monday, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby expressed doubts that ceasefire talks related to Gaza or Lebanon would resume soon. Meanwhile, Iran's mission to the United Nations issued a statement on Monday, warning that the U.S. would be 'complicit' in any Israeli actions against Iran if it supports Israel with advanced weaponry, highlighting the rising tensions in the region.The post Blinken Lands in Tel Aviv as Israeli Strike on Iran Looms, Ceasefire Talks Stall first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/blinken-tel-aviv-israeli-strike-iran/	2024-10-22T03:14:01-07:00	
Casualties Rise After Israeli Strike Near Beirut Hospital	The death toll has climbed to 13, including a child, following an Israeli airstrike near a hospital on the outskirts of Beirut, Lebanon's health ministry reported on Tuesday. The ministry also stated that the number of people injured in the attack, which took place outside the Rafik Hariri University Hospital—Lebanon's largest public hospital—has risen to 57. Of those injured, 17 were admitted to the hospital, with seven in critical condition. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the strike targeted what they described as a 'Hezbollah terrorist site' near the hospital on Monday. According to a CNN analysis, the location of the strike was outside the areas that had been subject to evacuation orders issued by the Israeli military.The post Casualties Rise After Israeli Strike Near Beirut Hospital first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/casualties-rise-israeli-strike-beirut-hospital/	2024-10-22T03:13:51-07:00	
Police Attempt to Evict Hundreds from Abandoned Hamra Building	Police in Beirut's Hamra commercial district forcibly entered an abandoned building on Monday to evict hundreds of people displaced by the ongoing war with Israel. These individuals had been squatting in the building for several weeks. Lebanese authorities have established numerous shelters to house the displaced population, but the sheer volume of people—now reaching nearly 20% of the population, or around 1.2 million—has overwhelmed the available facilities. Many fled their homes following an Israeli escalation last month, adding to the hundreds of thousands already displaced from southern Lebanon, Bekaa, and the southern suburbs of Beirut. Many of these people fled with nothing but the clothes on their backs. Government-run shelters, which are currently housing close to 200,000 people, are operating at full capacity. While some displaced individuals have found refuge with friends and family, many others have resorted to setting up temporary shelters on beaches and in open spaces. With winter fast approaching, they are increasingly desperate to find proper shelter. During the eviction, clashes erupted between the police and some of the displaced people who refused to leave the building. One person collapsed and had to be transported by ambulance, while a woman threatened to jump off the balcony, fearing the overcrowded government shelters where she believed conditions were unsafe and disease-ridden. The sudden eviction was unexpected, and its exact cause remains unclear. However, Lebanon's Interior Ministry stated that it would not permit the unauthorized occupation of private property, even amidst the ongoing displacement crisis.The post Police Attempt to Evict Hundreds from Abandoned Hamra Building first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/police-evict-hundreds-abandoned-hamra-building/	2024-10-22T02:45:40-07:00	
Israel Submits War-Ending Demands to U.S.	Last week, Israel provided the U.S. with a document outlining its conditions for a diplomatic solution to end the conflict in Lebanon and facilitate the return of displaced civilians on both sides of the border, according to two U.S. and two Israeli officials who spoke to Axios. Israeli officials said the Prime Minister's Office shared the document with the White House ahead of President Joe Biden's envoy, Amos Hochstein, traveling to Beirut on Monday to discuss a diplomatic resolution. The document was sent to Hochstein by Israeli Minister for Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer, a close advisor to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, after consultations with Israel’s Ministry of Defense and the military. Among Israel’s key demands is the right for its army to carry out 'active enforcement' to ensure that Hezbollah cannot rearm or rebuild its military infrastructure near the southern Lebanese border. Another demand is that Israel's air force retains freedom of operation in Lebanese airspace. These demands, however, conflict with U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which stipulates that the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) should enforce the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. An Israeli official noted, 'We are talking about 1701 with increased enforcement. Our message is that if the Lebanese army and UNIFIL do more, the Israeli army will do less, and vice versa.' A U.S. official commented that it is unlikely Lebanon or the international community would accept these terms, as they would severely undermine Lebanon's sovereignty. Upon arriving in Beirut on Monday, Hochstein met with acting Prime Minister Najib Mikati, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, and other Lebanese leaders to discuss Israel's conditions. Berri had earlier told Al-Arabiya that Hochstein’s visit represented 'the last chance before the U.S. elections to reach a solution' to the conflict in Lebanon. He emphasized Lebanon's consensus on adhering to U.N. Resolution 1701 and rejected any amendments, which is what Israel is reportedly demanding. Hochstein is advocating for the Lebanese army to deploy a significant force—at least 8,000 troops—across southern Lebanon as part of a comprehensive diplomatic solution to the war. In recent years, the Lebanese army's presence in this region has been limited. Additionally, Hochstein aims to strengthen UNIFIL's mandate, enabling it to assist the Lebanese army in preventing armed groups not controlled by the Lebanese government from operating near the Israeli border. U.S. officials pointed out that, since the 2006 war, UNIFIL has struggled to enforce Resolution 1701 effectively, allowing Hezbollah to build extensive military infrastructure in southern Lebanon in violation of the resolution.The post Israel Submits War-Ending Demands to U.S. first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-submits-war-ending-demands-us/	2024-10-22T02:45:18-07:00

On Monday, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri presented ideas to U.S. mediator Amos Hochstein to address the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, according to a media report. Sky News Arabia, citing unnamed sources, reported that Berri suggested to Hochstein that the three-week truce agreement could be reinstated and that Lebanon could elect a president during the first week of the ceasefire. Berri also stated that the newly elected president would oversee the enforcement of Resolution 1701 and work towards securing a lasting ceasefire. The sources noted that the U.S. had reconsidered its position on amending Resolution 1701 following Hochstein's visit and that Hochstein did not bring a specific 'solution' for Lebanon. The sources further explained that any changes to Resolution 1701 would require approval from Russia and China, and Washington is not currently inclined to pursue that effort.The post Berri to Hochstein: President Could Be Elected in First Week of Truce first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/berri-hochstein-president-elected-first-week-truce/	2024-10-22T02:44:24-07:00

The sources further mentioned that Berri agreed to Hochstein's proposal and engaged in discussions about the specific details and phases of the implementation process. Hochstein suggested an approach to Berri that would involve executing Resolution 1701 with an additional annex, outlining a mechanism for its implementation, the sources noted.The post Berri Backs Hochstein Proposal, Talks Ceasefire Mechanism first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/berri-backs-hochstein-talks-ceasefire-mechanism/	2024-10-22T02:39:21-07:00	
Israel Claims Hezbollah Hides Cash and Gold Beneath Sahel Hospita...	The director of a hospital in Lebanon has refuted claims made by the Israeli military that Hezbollah is storing money and gold beneath the medical facility. Fadi Alameh, a member of parliament and the director of Sahel General Hospital, dismissed the accusation, stating that there are no tunnels under the hospital. He also confirmed that the hospital, located in a southern suburb of Beirut, is currently being evacuated. Alameh, who represents the area where the hospital is located, called on the Lebanese Army and other relevant authorities to inspect the hospital and verify the claims. In an interview with Al-Jadeed TV, he clarified that the hospital is a private medical institution with underground surgery rooms, and has been operating for 42 years without any political affiliations. The Israeli military had accused Hezbollah of storing hundreds of millions of dollars in cash and gold beneath the hospital. According to Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari, there is an estimated half a billion dollars in cash and gold hidden in the hospital's bunker. Hagari suggested that this money could be used to rebuild Lebanon. Additionally, Israeli army Arabic-language spokesperson Avichay Adraee urged the Lebanese government to recover this 'stolen' money and prevent Hezbollah from utilizing it. Hagari further claimed that Iran funds Hezbollah by sending money and gold through its embassy in Beirut, though no concrete evidence was provided to support this assertion. Hagari also revealed that Israeli airstrikes had recently targeted key Hezbollah figures involved in the transfer of money between Iran and Hezbollah, including attacks in Beirut in early October and a strike in Syria on Monday. On Monday, Israeli military chief Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi stated that more than two dozen targets linked to al-Qard al-Hassan, a financial institution associated with Hezbollah, were struck. According to Halevi, nearly 30 Hezbollah-related sites in Lebanon were hit as part of the operation, targeting the group’s financial operations which Israel claims fund 'Hezbollah's terrorist activities.'The post Israel Claims Hezbollah Hides Cash and Gold Beneath Sahel Hospital first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-hezbollah-hides-cash-gold-sahel-hospital/	2024-10-22T02:38:51-07:00	
Israel Arrests 7 Citizens for Allegedly Running 'Spy Network' for...	Israeli authorities have dismantled a 'spy network' composed of seven Israeli citizens accused of working for Iran, according to a joint statement released by Israel Police and the Israel Security Agency (ISA) on Monday. The individuals, all Jewish citizens from Haifa and other areas in northern Israel, were reportedly involved in 'gathering sensitive information on IDF bases and energy infrastructure.' The statement noted that the alleged espionage activities took place over more than two years, during which the suspects conducted 'extensive reconnaissance missions on IDF bases across the country.' These missions were financially rewarded, often through cryptocurrency payments. The authorities emphasized that the arrests highlight Iran’s continued efforts to 'recruit and exploit Israeli citizens for espionage and terrorism within Israel.' They also mentioned that an indictment against the suspects would be filed in the coming days. These arrests come at a time when Israel is preparing for a retaliatory strike against Iran in response to Tehran’s missile attack on October 1, an incident for which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed Iran 'will pay.'The post Israel Arrests 7 Citizens for Allegedly Running 'Spy Network' for Iran first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israel-arrests-7-citizens-spy-network-iran/	2024-10-21T08:18:38-07:00

Israeli Strikes Hit Hezbollah’s Al-Qard Al-Hassan in Dahieh, Beka...	Israeli airstrikes targeted Beirut’s southern suburbs on Sunday night after the Israeli military announced it would strike Hezbollah’s financial institution, al-Qard al-Hassan, in various areas including Haret Hreik, Shiyyah, Ghobeiri, Choueifat, Tahwitat al-Ghadir, and Burj al-Barajneh. According to the National News Agency (NNA), 11 strikes were reported in Beirut’s southern suburbs, many aimed at al-Qard al-Hassan. Additional strikes hit locations in Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley and in the south. NNA also reported that one of the strikes landed near Beirut's main airport, a critical hub for humanitarian aid and evacuations amidst the ongoing conflict. Footage from AFP showed large plumes of smoke rising near the targeted facility. David Asher, an expert on illicit finance and senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, remarked that the targeting of al-Qard al-Hassan was significant, describing the organization as 'cash-based,' and implying that the strikes would render their cash reserves worthless. He added that the institution held large accounts with major Lebanese banks. Al-Qard al-Hassan issued a statement calling the targeting a sign of Israel’s 'bankruptcy,' assuring its customers that it had taken measures to protect their funds. Residents in the vicinity of the organization’s branches in Beirut were seen evacuating the area. Confusion and panic ensued when an evacuation notice issued for the Choueifat area incorrectly labeled a target as Grand Cinema ABC Verdun, a theater in a shopping mall located over 10 kilometers away in central Beirut. Al-Qard al-Hassan, a nonprofit organization sanctioned by both the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, provides financial services and is widely used by ordinary Lebanese. Israel’s airstrikes came a day after U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin expressed concern over the high civilian casualties in Lebanon and urged Israel to scale back its strikes, particularly in and around Beirut. Earlier on Sunday, Israel reported hitting dozens of targets in Lebanon as Hezbollah claimed responsibility for rocket attacks and ground clashes with Israeli forces.The post Israeli Strikes Hit Hezbollah’s Al-Qard Al-Hassan in Dahieh, Bekaa, and South first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-hit-hezbollahs-al-qard-al-hassan/	2024-10-21T03:17:33-07:00	
Berri Unveils Plan to Save Lebanon, Says US Pushing for Ceasefire	With U.S. mediator Amos Hochstein set to arrive in Beirut on Monday amid rising tensions in Lebanon, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri emphasized that this visit represents 'the last chance before the U.S. elections to find a solution' for the country. In an interview with Al-Arabiya, Berri revealed that he has been authorized by Hezbollah to negotiate on its behalf since 2006 and confirmed that the group agrees with U.N. Resolution 1701. He further noted that there is rare consensus among the Lebanese on this resolution, adding, 'We are committed to it.' Berri also made it clear that he opposes any amendments to Resolution 1701, and shared that he is working on a plan to save Lebanon. He dismissed claims that Iran is obstructing this effort, stressing that there is a U.S. desire to halt the conflict in Lebanon before the upcoming U.S. presidential election. Regarding the nomination of the army commander, Berri highlighted that a constitutional amendment and the approval of more than 86 deputies would be required. He acknowledged the unprecedented challenges facing Prime Minister Najib Mikati's government. Berri also pointed to the positive impact of the Saudi-Iranian rapprochement, contrasting it with Israel's destructive actions in Lebanon, similar to those in Gaza. He added that he has not discussed electing a Lebanese president until after a ceasefire is achieved.The post Berri Unveils Plan to Save Lebanon, Says US Pushing for Ceasefire first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/berri-plan-save-lebanon-us-ceasefire/	2024-10-21T03:16:36-07:00

Watch: Extinct Tasmanian Tiger May Return, Thanks to Preserved He...	The Tasmanian tiger, a marsupial apex predator, went extinct almost a century ago, but scientists are now closer than ever to bringing it back through genome sequencing—much like the fictional revival of dinosaurs in *Jurassic Park*. The Tasmanian tiger's genome has been reconstructed with 99.9% accuracy, marking a significant breakthrough in the ongoing 'de-extinction' project. Currently, only 45 gaps remain in the sequencing process, made possible by the serendipitous discovery of a preserved Tasmanian tiger head in Australia that dates back over 110 years. The ambitious effort is being led by Colossal Biosciences, a Texas-based company also working to revive the woolly mammoth and the extinct dodo bird. What Happened to the Tasmanian Tiger? Also known as the thylacine, the Tasmanian tiger was once the apex predator in the forests of Tasmania, Australia. Sadly, the species was declared extinct in 1936, following the death of the last known individual at Tasmania's Beaumaris Zoo. Colossal Biosciences recently teased that they are close to making a major announcement about the animal’s revival. The thylacine, officially named *Thylacinus cynocephalus*, may soon walk the Earth once again. A Head Pickled in a Jar May Bring the Tasmanian Tiger Back The preserved Tasmanian tiger head, discovered in a jar, still contained RNA molecules—crucial for reconstructing the animal’s genome. By analyzing samples from the head, researchers were able to sequence the majority of its DNA, including some RNA strands. This surprising discovery is being hailed as nothing short of a scientific miracle. Professor Andrew Pask, who leads the Thylacine Integrated Genetic Restoration Research (TIGRR) lab at the University of Melbourne, was stunned by the find. 'It was literally a head in a bucket of ethanol in the back of a cupboard that had been there for about 110 years,' he told *The Guardian*. 'It was pretty gruesome, with large chunks of it missing.' Genome Sequencing: A Path to Reviving Extinct Species? Professor Pask explained to *LiveScience* that old samples can yield excellent genomic data, which is the foundation for the 'de-extinction' of lost species. Genomes are the complete set of DNA that provide organisms with their unique traits and contain the information necessary for growth, development, and functioning. As Pask emphasized, obtaining a high-quality genome sequence is key to the efforts to bring back the Tasmanian tiger. 'The genome is the full blueprint for de-extincting this species,' he said, signaling an exciting future for the revival of extinct animals.The post Watch: Extinct Tasmanian Tiger May Return, Thanks to Preserved Head in Ethanol first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/extinct-tasmanian-tiger-return-head-ethanol/	2024-10-20T02:51:46-07:00	
Netanyahu: Iran and Proxies Will Pay ‘Heavy Price’ for Assassinat...	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday accused Iran and its ally, Hezbollah, of attempting to assassinate both him and his wife, warning that those responsible would face severe consequences. This statement came after Netanyahu’s office reported that a drone had targeted his residence in Caesarea. Netanyahu, who was not at home during the attack, stated, 'Iran's proxies who attempted to kill me and my wife today have made a serious mistake,' emphasizing that they would 'pay a heavy price' for their actions.The post Netanyahu: Iran and Proxies Will Pay ‘Heavy Price’ for Assassination Attempt first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/iran-proxies-pay-price-assassination-attempt/	2024-10-20T02:13:55-07:00	
Israeli Strikes Hit Dahieh at Dawn Following Evacuation Warning	Two Israeli airstrikes hit the southern suburbs of Beirut on Sunday, following warnings from the Israeli military for civilians to evacuate two specific areas, according to Lebanese state media. These strikes came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Hezbollah, a group backed by Iran, of attempting to assassinate him with an explosive drone targeting his residence. According to the National News Agency, one of the strikes hit a residential building in Haret Hreik, near a mosque and hospital. The Israeli military had previously warned civilians to evacuate areas near Hezbollah-affiliated buildings, with the military's Arabic spokesman, Avichay Adraee, stating on Telegram that the Israeli Defense Forces would soon target these locations. On Saturday, Netanyahu's office reported that a drone had been launched at his residence in Caesarea, though neither he nor his wife were home, and no injuries were sustained. Netanyahu condemned the attack, calling it a 'grave mistake' by Hezbollah and promising severe retaliation against anyone threatening Israeli citizens. In response to questions about its involvement in the attack, Iran’s United Nations mission confirmed that Hezbollah was responsible, but Hezbollah has not claimed responsibility for the incident. Tensions between Israel and Iran, Hezbollah's main backer, have been escalating since early October, when Israel vowed to retaliate against Iran for a missile barrage, and Iran has warned of retaliation if attacked.The post Israeli Strikes Hit Dahieh at Dawn Following Evacuation Warning first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/israeli-strikes-dahieh-evacuation-warning/	2024-10-20T02:13:23-07:00	
Hezbollah Launches Rocket Salvo at Northern Israel	Hezbollah announced that it had fired rockets at northern Israel, including a military base near Haifa, following a barrage of projectiles launched from Lebanon, as confirmed by the Israeli army. Hezbollah claimed a 'large salvo' of advanced rockets targeted a military base east of Haifa, as part of its vow to escalate attacks on Israel weeks into the ongoing war that began on September 23. The Iran-backed militant group also reported launching rockets at the northern town of Safed after the Israeli army confirmed that 115 projectiles were fired from Lebanon toward Israel on Saturday. Sirens echoed across northern Israel as the projectiles hit the region, warning residents of incoming attacks. Israeli emergency services reported that a man was killed by shrapnel near Acre, while five others sustained injuries in Kiryat Ata, mostly due to shrapnel, according to Magen David Adom, an Israeli emergency service provider. On Saturday evening, Hezbollah stated that it had struck Kiryat Ata in retaliation for Israeli strikes on civilians, particularly the recent bombing of Nabatiyeh in southern Lebanon, where 25 people were killed. The attack was also dedicated to Hezbollah's late leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in a significant Israeli strike on southern Beirut on September 27. A rocket hit Kiryat Ata, damaging a three-story building and destroying nearby vehicles. Firefighters and ambulances were deployed to the area, as shown in AFP footage. Meanwhile, Israel confirmed that a drone had targeted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea. However, Netanyahu and his wife were not present during the attack, and no injuries were reported. On Friday, Hezbollah announced it was entering a new 'escalatory phase' in its conflict with Israel. This comes after Israel significantly ramped up its airstrikes on Lebanon and deployed ground forces following nearly a year of cross-border skirmishes. Lebanese health officials reported that two people were killed in an Israeli strike on a key highway north of Beirut, marking the first attack on that area since the conflict with Hezbollah reignited. According to an AFP tally, at least 1,418 people have died in Lebanon since late September, although the true death toll is likely higher.The post Hezbollah Launches Rocket Salvo at Northern Israel first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-launches-rocket-salvo-northern-israel/	2024-10-20T02:13:06-07:00	
Iran Claims Hezbollah Launched Drone Attack on Netanyahu’s Reside...	Iran's United Nations mission has confirmed that Hezbollah, a group backed and funded by Tehran, was responsible for the drone attack targeting the residence of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. According to Iran's official IRNA news agency, the mission stated, 'This action was taken by the Lebanese Hezbollah' when asked about Iran's involvement in the incident. Earlier on Saturday, Netanyahu accused Hezbollah of attempting to assassinate him after a drone originating from Lebanon struck his family home. Netanyahu warned that both Iran and its proxies would face severe consequences for attempting to harm Israeli citizens. While Israeli officials initially pointed to Iran as being behind the attack, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Esmaeil Baghaei, dismissed these claims as lies, calling it part of Israel's 'permanent practice' of spreading falsehoods. The attack comes amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, in which Hezbollah and other Iran-aligned groups have become involved. Tehran itself has directly targeted Israel twice during the conflict, most notably with a 200-missile barrage on October 1. Israel has vowed to retaliate for these attacks, and Iran has warned it will respond if Israel strikes back.The post Iran Claims Hezbollah Launched Drone Attack on Netanyahu’s Residence first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/iran-hezbollah-drone-attack-netanyahus-residence/	2024-10-20T02:12:54-07:00	
Fearing Israeli Strikes on Airport, Lebanese Flee by Sea	Hassan Alik, escaping the intensifying violence of the Israel-Hezbollah conflict, departed Lebanon on Saturday aboard a ship, avoiding Beirut’s airport, which he feared 'could be bombed at any time.' The 31-year-old headed to the northern port of Tripoli on Lebanon's Mediterranean coast. So far, this area has been spared from Israeli attacks during a month of heavy fighting across much of the country. Although Lebanon's international airport remains undamaged, the Israeli military warned last month that it could strike the airport to disrupt weapons transfers to Hezbollah, backed by Iran. Fearing an attack, many Lebanese seeking to leave have chosen a 13-hour sea journey to Turkey on cargo ships modified for passengers, rather than flying from Beirut’s airport. The airport had been targeted during Israel's last major war with Hezbollah in 2006. 'I'm leaving from here because I'm scared to use the airport,' said Alik from the port in Tripoli. 'If I buy a plane ticket, the airport could get bombed,' added the resident of Beirut’s southern suburbs, a Hezbollah stronghold that has been hit hard during recent bombings. Israel launched its intense air campaign on Lebanon on September 23, following almost a year of cross-border exchanges with Hezbollah, in connection with the Gaza war. Israeli ground forces later joined the assault. The ongoing conflict has claimed at least 1,454 lives in Lebanon, according to an AFP tally based on Lebanese health ministry reports, though the actual number is likely higher. Most airlines, except for national carrier Middle East Airlines, have stopped flying to Beirut due to the hostilities. The large ships departing from Tripoli, once used exclusively for cargo to southern Turkey, began taking passengers about a year ago, offering tickets for around $350, according to Captain Salem Jleilati. Since the conflict escalated in September, demand for these trips has surged from 150 passengers a week to at least 900. Muammar Malas, 52, from northern Lebanon, said he chose to travel by sea because it was difficult to reach Beirut’s airport, which is located near Hezbollah’s stronghold in the southern suburbs. 'The cargo ships aren’t built for passengers, but we have no other choice,' Malas explained. More than a million people have fled the violence across Lebanon, officials reported. Mohammad Hawar, 22, has already been displaced twice, first from the southern city of Nabatieh, where Israeli strikes killed dozens of people, and later from southern Beirut. 'The best thing to do now is leave Lebanon,' he told AFP as he boarded the ship. Israa Sweidan, a Palestinian woman from the Beddawi refugee camp, which has also been targeted, said the sea route from Tripoli was 'currently the safest option in Lebanon.'The post Fearing Israeli Strikes on Airport, Lebanese Flee by Sea first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/fearing-israeli-strikes-airport-lebanese-flee-sea/	2024-10-20T02:12:24-07:00	
Gantz Urges Netanyahu to Halt Videos, Warns of Prolonged War in L...	In response to criticism from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party, which accused him of failing to condemn a Hezbollah drone attack on the prime minister's residence in Caesarea due to 'petty politics,' Benny Gantz's National Unity party issued a firm rebuttal. The party urged Netanyahu to 'stop focusing on press releases and embarrassing videos.' 'At a time when hundreds of rockets are being fired at Israeli citizens, lives are being lost, and soldiers are falling, the Prime Minister is concerned with himself and property taxes,' the statement read. According to the Kan public broadcaster, property tax officials and a gardener had visited Netanyahu’s home following the attack. Gantz’s party warned that Netanyahu must ensure Israel is not 'dragged into a prolonged war of attrition' in Lebanon. They also emphasized the need for Israel to intensify its strikes in Lebanon, including targeting state infrastructure, and called for a swift and 'effective response' against Iran.The post Gantz Urges Netanyahu to Halt Videos, Warns of Prolonged War in Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/gantz-urges-netanyahu-halt-videos-prolonged-war-lebanon/	2024-10-20T02:12:06-07:00	
Mikati Condemns Iranian ‘Interference,’ Orders Envoy Summoned	On Friday, Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati criticized comments reportedly made by Iranian parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf regarding Tehran’s willingness to negotiate with France on the implementation of U.N. Resolution 1701. Mikati stated that such remarks represent 'blatant interference' in Lebanon's internal affairs and an attempt to exert unwelcome control over the country. He emphasized that during recent visits by Iran's foreign minister and parliament speaker, Lebanese officials had made it clear that Iran must respect Lebanon’s sovereignty. 'Lebanon is currently facing an unprecedented assault, and we are working with our allies, including France, to pressure Israel to agree to a ceasefire,' Mikati said. He stressed that it is the responsibility of the Lebanese state to manage negotiations concerning Resolution 1701 and urged all parties to support Lebanon's efforts rather than impose new forms of control that undermine its sovereignty. Mikati also directed caretaker Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib to summon the Iranian charge d'affaires for questioning regarding Ghalibaf’s alleged remarks. Later, the Iranian parliament denied the comments attributed to Ghalibaf, affirming that Tehran supports whatever decisions are made by the Lebanese people, government, and resistance to secure a lasting truce. Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea praised Mikati's response, noting that it gives hope that the Lebanese state is beginning to 'take responsibility.' Geagea added that Mikati’s remarks reflect the views of all patriotic Lebanese and encouraged the prime minister to continue demanding a ceasefire based on U.N. resolutions 1559, 1680, and 1701, as this is the only way to end the ongoing violence that has plagued Lebanon for nearly two months.The post Mikati Condemns Iranian ‘Interference,’ Orders Envoy Summoned first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/mikati-condemns-iranian-interference-envoy-summoned/	2024-10-18T23:43:18-07:00	
Hezbollah Strikes Israel, Unveils New ‘Escalatory Phase’	On Friday, Hezbollah launched a series of rocket attacks targeting Israel's Yoav barracks in the occupied Golan Heights and the Zofolon area, located north of Haifa. In response, the Israeli army ordered the evacuation of 20 towns in southern Lebanon and conducted strikes on several southern Lebanese towns, including Jbaa, Aita al-Shaab, Zrariyeh, Marwanieh, Bazourieh, Shaaytiyeh, Ebl al-Siqi, Malkieh, and Ansar. The previous day, the Israeli military reported the deaths of five soldiers during combat operations in southern Lebanon, bringing the total number of Israeli troops killed since the start of their raids last month to 19. Additionally, Israeli sources confirmed that 31 soldiers were injured in a drone attack near the border. On Friday, the Israeli army announced plans to deploy another brigade to its northern border as part of an ongoing assessment of the situation. In recent days, Hezbollah has successfully targeted several Israeli tanks near the border with guided missiles, as Israeli forces attempted to penetrate Lebanon's border villages. On Thursday, Hezbollah reported hitting two Merkava tanks near the village of Labbouneh, resulting in fires and casualties. Hezbollah lawmaker Hassan Fadlallah stated that the Israeli army has yet to establish full control over any village in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah also declared the launch of a new phase in its conflict with Israel, revealing that it had used precision-guided missiles against Israeli forces for the first time. In a statement on Thursday, the group announced an escalation in the confrontation, signaling that more significant developments were expected in the coming days.The post Hezbollah Strikes Israel, Unveils New ‘Escalatory Phase’ first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/hezbollah-strikes-israel-new-escalatory-phase/	2024-10-18T23:43:11-07:00

Samir Geagea, leader of the Lebanese Forces, criticized the Lebanese government for acting more like a 'rescue committee' than a functioning state, accusing it of allowing Iran to use Lebanon as a battleground for its own conflicts. In an interview with *Asharq al-Awsat* published on Friday, Geagea blamed Hezbollah for Lebanon's current situation, accusing the country's leaders of idly standing by instead of enforcing United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701. Geagea urged the government to take action by convening and making a firm decision to deploy the army and enforce the resolution. He also commented on the aftermath of the killing of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli strike, claiming that Hezbollah is now fully controlled by Iran. According to Geagea, all decisions within Hezbollah are now being made by Iran, which he believes will continue its fight through Hezbollah 'until the last fighter.'The post Geagea Claims Hezbollah Now Fully Controlled by Iran After Nasrallah’s Death first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/geagea-hezbollah-controlled-iran-nasrallahs/	2024-10-18T23:43:03-07:00	
Bassil Urges Unity, Ceasefire, and Presidential Consensus	Jebran Bassil, the head of the Free Patriotic Movement, has urged for unity in facing Israel, calling for an immediate ceasefire and the election of a consensus president in Lebanon. In an interview with the al-Modon news portal, Bassil emphasized that the top priority should be achieving a ceasefire and preventing any potential re-occupation of southern Lebanon. Bassil revealed that he has introduced a new initiative, which he has discussed with key international players such as the U.S., Saudi Arabia, France, Egypt, and Qatar. He mentioned that he also held meetings with the British ambassador and the Special Representative of the U.N. Secretary-General. His plan starts with securing a ceasefire and is followed by the election of a president that all parties can agree on. Bassil added that he is currently gathering the names of potential presidential candidates, including Hezbollah's Suleiman Franjieh, the army chief, and Samir Geagea, leader of the Lebanese Forces. Bassil further stressed the importance of enforcing U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, and he affirmed that no Lebanese citizen would tolerate any form of occupation. He also praised Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, describing him as a patriotic, responsible, and wise leader, despite their longstanding political differences.The post Bassil Urges Unity, Ceasefire, and Presidential Consensus first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/bassil-unity-ceasefire-presidential-consensus/	2024-10-18T23:42:50-07:00

Biden: Ceasefire in Lebanon May Be Easier to Achieve Than in Gaza	U.S. President Joe Biden recently suggested that negotiating a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah could prove easier than doing so with Hamas. During a meeting in Berlin with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Biden discussed the potential path to end the ongoing Middle East conflict, particularly following the recent killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza. Biden expressed optimism, saying the leaders see a possible opportunity for a cease-fire in Lebanon, though he noted that achieving a cease-fire in Gaza would be more challenging. He emphasized that there needs to be a plan in place for what happens after a cease-fire is reached. Yahya Sinwar, a prominent Hamas leader, was killed by Israeli forces on Wednesday. Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the following day but did not disclose whether Netanyahu had committed to resuming negotiations for a cease-fire or the release of hostages. Biden stated that discussions on these matters are ongoing but did not provide further details. When asked about Israel’s potential response to Iran’s recent missile attack, Biden confirmed he had an understanding of when and how Israel might retaliate but declined to elaborate further.The post Biden: Ceasefire in Lebanon May Be Easier to Achieve Than in Gaza first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/ceasefire-lebanon-easier-achieve-gaza/	2024-10-18T23:41:57-07:00	
WHO: 'Very High' Cholera Risk Spreading in Lebanon	The World Health Organization (WHO) issued a warning on Wednesday about the 'very high' risk of cholera spreading in Lebanon after a case of the disease was confirmed in the country's northern region. Abdinasir Abubakar, the WHO's representative in Lebanon, expressed concern over the potential outbreak, citing the worsening water and sanitation conditions for refugees and in vulnerable areas. He emphasized that if cholera were to reach the newly displaced population, it could spread rapidly. Lebanon experienced its first cholera outbreak in three decades between 2022 and 2023, primarily in the northern region. With over a million people displaced due to the Israel-Hezbollah conflict, Abubakar pointed to particular concerns for southern Lebanon and Beirut, where communities have not built up immunity to cholera in decades. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stated that Lebanon’s Ministry of Public Health had activated emergency measures, such as enhanced surveillance and contact tracing, after detecting the cholera case. In August, the ministry initiated a cholera vaccination campaign aimed at 350,000 people in high-risk areas, but the effort was disrupted by the ongoing violence, according to the WHO. Cholera, a disease that spreads primarily through contaminated water and food, leads to severe diarrhea and dehydration. Those living in areas with limited access to clean water or poor sanitation are especially vulnerable, as the disease can result from consuming food or water contaminated with the cholera bacteria.The post WHO: 'Very High' Cholera Risk Spreading in Lebanon first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/who-high-cholera-risk-spreading-lebanon/	2024-10-17T01:02:07-07:00	
US B-2 Strikes Hit 5 Houthi Weapon Storage Sites, Defense Secreta...	The U.S. carried out airstrikes on five 'hardened underground weapons storage locations' in areas controlled by the Houthis in Yemen, using B-2 stealth bombers, according to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Wednesday evening (Thursday morning local time). Austin described the operation as a 'unique demonstration' of the U.S.'s ability to strike facilities that adversaries attempt to protect, regardless of how deeply they are buried or fortified. He emphasized that the use of B-2 Spirit long-range stealth bombers highlights America's global strike capabilities to target such locations whenever necessary. The defense secretary explained that the strikes were authorized by President Joe Biden with the aim of 'further degrading' the Houthis' ability to attack, following over a year of their assaults on U.S. and international vessels in the region. The targeted facilities housed 'various weapons components' used in these attacks. Austin added, 'We will continue to make it clear to the Houthis that there will be consequences for their illegal and reckless attacks.'The post US B-2 Strikes Hit 5 Houthi Weapon Storage Sites, Defense Secretary Confirms first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/b-2-strikes-5-houthi-weapon-storage-sites-secretary-confirms/	2024-10-17T00:33:38-07:00

Yemen's Houthi movement has declared that the United States will 'pay the price' following U.S. airstrikes against the Iran-backed group. These strikes targeted five underground weapons storage facilities, with the use of B-2 stealth bombers. Nasruddin Amer, deputy head of the Houthis' media office, made a statement on X, saying that the U.S. aggression in Yemen would not deter them from their stance in support of Gaza. The Houthis have been targeting ships in the Red Sea for months, a critical global shipping route, claiming their actions are in response to Israel's war in Gaza. Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis form part of an Iran-led alliance that spans across Yemen, Syria, Gaza, and Iraq. This coalition has been attacking Israel and its allies since the onset of the conflict and has vowed to continue until a ceasefire is achieved in Gaza. The U.S. strikes on Yemen occur amidst rising tensions across the region. Israel is anticipated to retaliate against Iran for a recent missile attack, all while dealing with intensifying conflicts with Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza.The post Breaking: Houthi Spokesperson Warns: US Will 'Pay the Price' for Yemen Strikes first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/houthi-warns-us-pay-price-strikes/	2024-10-17T00:32:59-07:00

Macron Riles Netanyahu with Sharp Comment on Israel’s Founding	French President Emmanuel Macron has added further strain to the already tense relations with Israel through a recent comment regarding the founding of the Israeli state. This remark, quickly criticized by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was seen as a distortion of historical facts. Macron, aiming to take a firmer stance on Middle East conflicts following Israel’s offensive in Lebanon, a former French protectorate, stated that halting the export of weapons used by Israel in Lebanon and Gaza was the only way to end the ongoing conflicts. France, which has the largest Jewish population in Europe, has repeatedly called for a ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon, while also increasingly condemning Israel for the civilian casualties in these areas. Paris has also expressed outrage over Israeli attacks on the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which includes 700 French troops. In another sign of escalating tensions, organizers of the upcoming Euronaval defense show in Paris announced that, following a French government decision, Israeli exhibits and stands would be excluded from the event. Macron’s Controversial Remarks During a closed-door meeting at the Elysee Palace, Macron stated, 'Mr. Netanyahu must not forget that his country was created by a decision of the U.N.,' referencing the 1947 U.N. General Assembly resolution to partition Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state. He added that this is not the time to disregard U.N. decisions. These comments were shared by two meeting participants who spoke anonymously to AFP. Netanyahu responded to Macron’s statement, asserting that Israel’s establishment was a result of victory in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, not a U.N. resolution. He also highlighted the contribution of Holocaust survivors, including French Jews, who fought for Israel’s independence after surviving Nazi occupation and persecution during World War II. 'A reminder to the president of France: It was not the U.N. resolution that established the State of Israel, but rather the victory achieved in the war of independence with the blood of heroic fighters, many of whom were Holocaust survivors — including from the Vichy regime in France,' Netanyahu said. Tense Phone Call The tense nature of the exchange between the two leaders was evident in a late-night summary of their phone call released by the French presidency. Macron condemned 'indiscriminate Israeli strikes that only add to an already intolerable human toll, in Gaza as in Lebanon,' further highlighting the strained relations. Concerns Within the Jewish Community Macron’s remarks also sparked unease within France's Jewish community. Yonathan Arfi, president of the Representative Council of French Jewish Institutions (CRIF), warned that Macron’s comments 'dangerously strengthen the camp of those who question Israel’s right to exist.' Caroline Yadan, an MP from Macron’s party, expressed concern, asking, 'What does this statement imply? That what the U.N. has done, the U.N. can undo? Is this a warning?' The French left-leaning newspaper *Liberation* remarked that Macron’s comments have caused uncertainty and division among his supporters, noting that the president’s words have 'sown trouble in the macronie.'The post Macron Riles Netanyahu with Sharp Comment on Israel’s Founding first appeared on The Daily Star Lebanon.	https://dailystar.com.lb/macron-riles-netanyahu-comment-israels-founding/	2024-10-17T00:30:52-07:00	
Watch: Tuchel Set to Be Unveiled as New England Manager	Former Chelsea head coach Thomas Tuchel is set to take over as the manager of the England men's national team, becoming the third foreign manager in the role after Sven-Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello. The German coach, who led Chelsea to Champions League glory in 2021 and enjoyed successful stints with PSG, Bayern Munich, and Borussia Dortmund, is expected to officially take charge in January 2025. According to Sky Germany, Tuchel is poised to sign an 18-month contract, which will run until the end of the 2026 World Cup. The deal was reached after several discussions with the Football Association (FA), with an announcement anticipated on Wednesday, October 16. With Tuchel's impressive track record, the FA hopes he can help end England’s 58-year wait for a major tournament victory. The FA decided against appointing an English manager to succeed Gareth Southgate, who consistently guided England to the knockout stages of major tournaments but fell short of winning a title. Southgate stepped down after the Euro 2024 final loss, and Lee Carsley has been serving as interim manager since August. Tuchel previously managed Chelsea from January 2021, leading the club to Champions League success shortly after his arrival, as well as winning the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup. Despite a successful tenure, he was sacked in September 2022. Following his departure from Chelsea, Tuchel was appointed head coach of Bayern Munich, where he won an 11th consecutive Bundesliga title. However, his time at Bayern also saw the club endure its first trophyless season in 12 years. As Tuchel prepares to take over from Southgate, he will inherit a talented squad featuring the likes of Harry Kane, Jude Bellingham, and Cole Palmer, positioning England as strong contenders for the 2026 World Cup. Commenting on the potential appointment, England captain Harry Kane told Sky Germany, 'I know Thomas well from last year. He’s a fantastic coach and person, so I’m sure the FA will contact me when they have more information.'
