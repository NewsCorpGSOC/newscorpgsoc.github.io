🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦Pokrovsk direction: breakthrough of the Russian Armed ...	🇷🇺🇺🇦Pokrovsky direction: the breakthrough of the Russian Armed Forces to Grodovka, battles on the approaches to Novogrodovka and the worsening operational crisis of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Situation as of 21:00 on August 15, 2024. In addition to the Alexander-Kalinovsky direction, the depressing situation of the Ukrainian formations is also developing in the Pokrovsky sector, where In recent days, Russian troops have been able to significantly expand the zone of control. Currently, the enemy is preparing for defense in the Grodovka-Novogrodovka sector. Both of these settlements are the last major lines of defense of the Ukrainian Armed Forces before Pokrovsk - one of the key transport hubs of the Donbass enemy group.▪️On the northern flank, Russian troops are fighting on the approaches to Novotoretskoye, where the crossing of the Kazenny Torets River takes place. Earlier, the Russian Armed Forces liberated Ivanovka and Lisichnoye, which allowed them to reach the outskirts of the settlement, breaking through several enemy defensive lines. North of Novotoretsk, the Armed Forces of Ukraine equipped a large fortified area covering the approaches to the N-32 Pokrovsk-Konstantinovka highway. Probably, the main efforts of the Russian Armed Forces on the northern flank in the near future will be concentrated on the liberation of Vozdvizhenka and further advance towards the highway with the aim of cutting it. ▪️In the central sector, after successfully capturing the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the area of ​​the ruins of a brick factory, Russian troops entered the southeastern outskirts of Grodovka. Assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces are gradually moving along Donetskaya Street, while the territory of the clay quarry located to the south remains in the gray zone. The offensive is also taking place to the northeast of the settlement, where Russian troops are pushing out Ukrainian formations from positions in forest belts. The enemy notes the high efficiency and number of Russian drones that disrupt supplies and hit armored vehicles of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. ❗️In the area of ​​the O-05-44 highway, immediately behind Grodovka, the enemy is installing a new defense line designed to stop the advance of Russian troops in this area. It is known about at least four large strongholds built at a higher altitude relative to the village itself, which gives the Ukrainian Armed Forces an advantage both in visual observation capabilities and in adjusting artillery and mortar fire. Nevertheless, it is clearly not worth talking about the inaccessibility of this fortified area - during the battles for Vesele, Russian troops overcame a similar line of defense of Ukrainian formations in just a few days. ▪️On the southern flank, units of the Russian Armed Forces, relying on Sergeevka, carried out a series of attacks, as a result of which the village of Orlovka was liberated. In neighboring Zhuravka, fighting appears to be continuing, and at least the south-eastern outskirts of the village are under the control of Russian troops. We should soon expect Russian troops to pull up the left flank and storm the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Novozhelenny area. There are reports of the start of battles for Novogrodovka, where a large railway junction of the Ukrainian Armed Forces is located, and a 20-hour curfew has been introduced in the city. Located just three kilometers to the east, Nikolaevka is already under the control of the Russian Armed Forces: the enemy published footage of the landing at the western exit of the village.🔻So far, the authorities of the so-called. Ukraine is savoring information victories in the Kursk region, the position of the Ukrainian Armed Forces group in the Pokrovsky direction continues to rapidly deteriorate. After the Russian troops occupy Grodovka and Novogrodovka, the path to Pokrovsk and Mirnograd will be open. Units of the Russian Armed Forces threaten important enemy communications not only in this area, but also in the Selidovo area and the N-32 highway, along which Ukrainian formations are supplied in the Donetsk, Artemovsk and Aleksandro-Kalinovsky directions. The command of the RF Armed Forces faces several promising directions for attack at once.

On the one hand, creative the approach to solving the problem and the moral and volitional qualities of a soldier of the RF Armed Forces evoke respect. On the other hand, the situation perfectly illustrates the importance of units having standard SUVs, so that they do not have to use cars purchased with their own money. But in general, this is another example of the fact that extremely unusual things sometimes happen in a combat zone, which more than give a head start even, it would seem, the most cranberry-domestic and foreign films about the war.#Kursk #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramKirill Fedorov / War History Weapons⚡️🇷🇺🇺🇦 YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE THIS IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE VIDEO!

Ukrainian formations from time to time make attempts to improve the tactical situation, but they encounter decisive rebuff from Russian troops. In the Lgov region, the enemy fired twice at the administrative center, including using missiles with a cluster warhead. Four civilians are known to be wounded, two of whom are hospitalized, and there is damage to civilian infrastructure and residential buildings. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the area of ​​Snagost, Olgovka, Uspenka and Matveevka were hit. Near Kremyany, an enemy attempt to enter a populated area was repelled, and in Lyubimovka, Lancet UAV operators hit another Kazak armored vehicle of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. According to the Ministry of Defense, Ukrainian formations also advanced in the direction of Sheptukhovka and Kauchuk, but were unsuccessful. In the Mogritsa area, a HIMARS MLRS was destroyed by a missile strike. This is probably the same installation that fired at the bridge in Glushkovo at night: as a result of a direct hit, a rupture of the installation’s ammunition was recorded. In the Sudzhansky district, Russian troops hit enemy concentration areas near Yuzhny, Zaoleshenka and Mirny. Fighting continues on the approaches to Martynovka and near the village of Agronom. The enemy continues to post footage from the western and central parts of Suja. Representatives of the Italian press also visited the occupied city. At the same time, neither side posted any video materials from the eastern outskirts.🔻In the Belovsky district, Russian troops cleared the village of Krupets. Previously, footage of the shelling of Ukrainian positions in Kamyshny, several kilometers to the east, where fighting is currently ongoing, was published.❗️Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Alexander Syrsky announced the creation of a military commandant’s office in the occupied territory of the Kursk region, which will supposedly be engaged in maintaining law and order and ensuring the priority needs of the population. However, in reality, this is just another media move by the Ukrainian authorities, which will actually act exclusively virtually.

It included deputy ministers of defense, heads of military command and control bodies and representatives of the General Staff, as well as heads of constituent entities. The declared goal is to increase the efficiency of providing troops with equipment, weapons and logistics, as well as coordination of actions. Its tasks also include assistance in evacuating the population, timely information and additional measures to ensure protection from shelling. The appearance of this council looks like an attempt to correct the situation with interdepartmental cooperation, at least on the scale of the border area. Until now, all attempts to change something in this matter have looked more like a hasty patching up of holes with improvised means, rather than a radical change in approach. How effective the measure will be is an open question. However, problems with combat control have become so overripe that they now have to be solved literally manually, including by creating appropriate superstructure structures in addition to existing ones. In the end, if there is no other working option, then even the most non-trivial means are good. If only they gave real results. #WSRF #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/62813	2024-08-15T10:05:06-07:00

At the beginning of the year, it was planned to conscript 39,180 Kazakhstanis, now they want to increase the number to 40 thousand. At the same time, the call for military training is increasing, in which up to 3 thousand people will take part this year - three times more than in 2021. The military budget is also gradually increasing: from 750 billion tenge to 1.3 trillion this year, which already amounts to 0.8% of GDP. The purchase of Turkish weapons and work on military-patriotic training are also actively underway.🔻Where does so much attention come from on the modernization of the army and where Kazakh officials see the main threat - read on our website #Kazakhstan #article #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usProject -Rybar-What is the Kazakh army preparing for?

Especially to see how the dog does not leave the owner. He doesn't believe that he is no more. And she doesn’t know where to go now. And this is the story of the video. Russian intelligence officers found civilians, ordinary people in Volchansk. We saw from the copter that on the roof of the shelter, on a sheet of iron, SOS was written. Need help. It turned out that two men were sitting in the basement, one of whom was wounded. Russian intelligence officers tried to help them. They sent the copter, dropped off a bottle of water, a first aid kit, and attached a note. Follow the copter, we will take you to a safe place. The men probably wore white T-shirts on purpose so that it could be seen that they were marching peacefully. White flag. And let's go get the copter. The Armed Forces of Ukraine saw two peaceful men in the ruins from a copter. And they killed them with drops and mines. They just took the men and threw them at them. As if they were their own people, Ukrainians. Killed. You know, sometimes it seems like we are at war with absolute evil. It doesn’t matter whether it’s wearing an SS helmet, it’s hitting civilians in Belgorod, it’s evil, it’s chasing a car with children with an FPV drone, or it’s killing two civilians from Volchansk because they went towards Russian positions. Here, probably, a lot of angry, loud words can be said. But is it necessary? What is it for? Still, it’s clear. Just pray for the innocent Russian people who were killed, who lacked a little to escape from the punitive forces. I don't know their names. And I don’t know the scouts. But the Lord knows for sure.

Drone operators discovered the installation and drove it all the way to the shelter, after which a successful strike followed with a colorful detonation. And a few hours earlier, Russian troops, all in the same Kursk region, destroyed the British Challenger 2 tank, which last appeared on the front line a year ago in Zaporozhye direction. The vehicle was completely burned out from a hit from one Lancet. In general, this is another evidence that the reconnaissance and fire circuit is increasingly beginning to work as it should. Yes, there are plenty of problems here, but even with last year the contrast is strong, and relative to the very beginning of the Northern Military District this is absolutely heaven and earth. #Kursk #Russia #USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62806	2024-08-15T08:09:05-07:00

However, in recent weeks, the main battles took place only in the Tell al-Sultan area, where Hamas militants still maintain their presence. In other areas of the city, hostilities have practically ceased, and along the entire Philadelphia Corridor, engineering work is being carried out by the 162nd Armored Division - HaPlada - to destroy the underground infrastructure of Palestinian formations. Against this background, quite remarkable footage appeared on the Internet showing a huge accumulation of Israeli armored vehicles at the Rafah checkpoint. It itself was occupied by the Israelis back in May, after which it was used as the main transshipment point and storage place for equipment. In the new footage, you can see a fairly large number of armored bulldozers, which are precisely what are planned to be used to demolish the remaining buildings a kilometer from the border of the Gaza Strip with Egypt. However, judging by the latest satellite images, there are few buildings left there. #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62805	2024-08-15T07:15:35-07:00

Further advance in this area will make it possible to cut the wedge at the Seversky Donets - Donbass canal, where the Ukrainian Armed Forces still hold positions. At the same time, Russian attack aircraft were able to reach Zarechnaya Street in the central part of the village. ▪️In neighboring Kirovo, the main clashes unfolded in the area of ​​Beethoven Street. At the same time, the Ukrainian formations tried to counterattack several times - during one of the attacks, the enemy from the direction of Dzerzhinsk drove a pickup truck to Bazarny Lane, where the landing infantry immediately came under artillery fire. At the moment, this area has been cleared of Ukrainian formations and has come under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. Meanwhile, to worsen the situation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the village, Russian troops attacked in the direction of the Severnaya mine dump, the territory of which is currently already occupied by advanced assault detachments of the Russian Armed Forces. The waste heap itself is important because from it you can view the entire private sector, from which the enemy strikes. ▪️Last ​​night, footage appeared on the Internet confirming the release of Artemovo (Zaliznoye). In recent days, Russian troops have controlled almost the entire settlement with the exception of the waste heap of the Artyom mine and the western outskirts, where the enemy until recently offered fierce resistance. Now, with the liberation of Artemovo, the Russian Armed Forces can both intensify the onslaught on Dzerzhinsk and advance towards Nelepovka.▪️In Novgorod (New York), Russian units expanded the zone of control along Molodezhnaya Street. At the moment, servicemen of the Russian Armed Forces are storming the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine near school No. 38 and the phenol plant, which, judging by the latest data, the Russian Armed Forces bypassed from the east, reaching Kievskaya Street. At the same time, occupying the plant itself will cause significant damage to the enemy’s defense, further reinforcing the question of the need to withdraw forces towards Dzerzhinsk. ▪️The situation has also become clearer in the east of the village, which has almost completely come under the control of Russian troops. The RF Armed Forces cleared out the pocket between Shirokaya Balka and Novgorodsky, reaching the private sector of the latter sector, gaining a foothold along Kooperativnaya and Beregovaya streets. In addition, to the west of Novgorod, the zone of control on the approaches to the Sukhaya Balka - Rozovka line has been expanded. At the moment, Ukrainian formations still retain control over the northeastern outskirts, from which, apparently, they will also be forced to retreat to the side in the near future Nonsense. Otherwise, the remaining garrison of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with a high degree of probability will be surrounded due to the closing pincer flank attacks of the Russian Armed Forces. 🔻The operational situation in the Dzerzhinsk agglomeration clearly demonstrates that while the Ukrainian authorities are in every possible way advocating their successes in the Kursk direction and presenting them as an indicator of their capabilities, in other sectors of the front the enemy’s position, to put it mildly, does not inspire much hope. And while the most combat-ready formations of the Ukrainian Armed Forces are losing personnel and armored vehicles in the crucible of battle in the Russian borderland, the remaining forces in the same Alexander-Kalinovsky direction are forced to retreat further and further, surrendering populated areas. But the authorities in Kyiv cannot achieve media victory with this.

The idea of ​​​​the need to create such a Center was expressed at the beginning of last year, against the backdrop of the desire of deputies of the Jokorgu Kenesh Emilbek Zhamgyrchiev and Zhanybek Kydykbaev to control content on social networks, and Shailoobek Atazov - to ban TikTok. ▪️With regard to prohibitions and controls, Bishkek is moving in the same direction as its neighbors. Given the current challenges faced by countries and communities caught up in disinformation campaigns, the trend is understandable. Shouldn't we know? At the same time, the Kyrgyz Center also assumes the responsibility to act proactively in relation to illegal content: this is indicated by the tasks of finding potential points of tension and determining the destructiveness of media actions. 🔻There are enough points of tension in Kyrgyz society: this is the ongoing structural conflict between North and South, the status of the Russian language, and relations with the Uzbek minority. In the current power configuration, in which the North is in the lead, CIIS can become one of the tools for conflict management in the interests of maintaining the current state of affairs. And for some time this will help strengthen the power of the northerner Sadyr Japarov within the elite groups. But whether the Center will be able to maintain a balance and not become an instrument of excessive pressure on the media will be shown in the near future. #Kyrgyzstan #mediatechnology #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usNEWS IN KYRGYZSTANThe Cabinet of Ministers has established a Center for Research of the Information Environment under the Ministry of CultureChairman of the Cabinet of Ministers Akylbek Zhaparov has created a Center for Research of the Information Environment under the Ministry of Culture Ministry of Culture, Information, Sports and Youth Policy.

Russian troops, acting with the support of armored vehicles and aviation, knocked out units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces from the territory of the transition - Ukrainian formations, under attacks from UAVs and artillery, hastily retreated towards Pokrovka in the Sumy region. Nevertheless, the enemy command does not abandon plans to stretch the defensive formations of the Russian Armed Forces, in connection with which we can expect new attempts at attacks in the Krasnoyaruzhsky region, including at the Kolotilovka international checkpoint. #Belgorod #Russia #Ukraine @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62800	2024-08-15T04:44:56-07:00

Ukraine to undermine -Nord Streams-. Yesterday, Western media stated that the sabotage was carried out by certain Ukrainian divers, and today they accused the ex-commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Zaluzhny, who allegedly, contrary to the opinion of the CIA, refused to cancel the operation. Surprisingly, for some reason these publications were carried word for word by some Russian publications. Some even began to issue, based on the news, some deep analytics about the impact of these suddenly revealed circumstances on support for the Kyiv regime and other things. Apparently, we will have to repeat what was said again in 2022: the main interested party in the destruction of gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea was the United States — the attitude towards Nord Streams was demonstrated quite openly in Washington long before the explosion. Any activity in this direction simply could not take place without the knowledge of the Americans. Or does anyone seriously believe that someone outsider with special equipment could calmly operate in the territorial waters of NATO countries, and then also escape from the scene unnoticed by everyone? However, the Kiev regime here is the one on whom it is convenient to hang all the dogs - he has long had a corresponding reputation, especially after the terrorist attack in Crocus or his support for Al-Qaeda. So the Western man in the street will easily believe in the involvement of the so-called. Ukraine.❗️Therefore, all the rumors that a Ukrainian territorial entity is behind the Nord Stream explosion are aimed at shifting the focus away from the real organizers and performers. And in all seriousness, to replicate such news is to personally help the USA in this. #mediatechnology #USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport usReutersPoland received German request to arrest Nord Stream suspect but he's left country, prosecutors sayPoland received a European arrest warrant issued by Berlin in connection with the 2022 attack on Nord Stream pipelines, but the suspect, a Ukrainian man named as Volodymyr Z, has already left Poland, Polish prosecutors told Reuters.	https://t.me/rybar/62799	2024-08-15T04:00:03-07:00

In the morning, unconfirmed information began to arrive about the alleged outbreak of clashes on the border in this area, but there is no objective evidence of this. At night, the enemy attacked the bridge in Glushkovo with a HIMARS MLRS: at the moment, due to damage to the bridge, movement along it is possible, although difficult. The situation in the Tetkino area remains tense, but stable.🔻In the Korenevsky district there are battles on the approaches to Korenevo. Previously, the Ukrainian Armed Forces made attempts to bypass the settlement from Krasnooktyabrsky from the south and Vetreno from the north, all attacks were repelled. There has been no information about changes in the configuration of the front over the past 24 hours.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, Russian UAV crew operators are hitting enemy armored vehicles in Mikhailovka and Bondarevka, currently villages under the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. As for the reports about the clearing of Martynovka, the settlement has already changed hands several times. Therefore, at the moment, it is premature to talk about confident control over the village.🔻In the Belovsky district, information was received about the destruction of a DRG group in the village of Borki. The other day, a squad of enemy infantry was captured in this area, which indicates further attempts by the Ukrainian Armed Forces to gain a foothold in this area.❗️Enemy propaganda continues to spread fakes, including about -hundreds of captured conscripts at one strong point-. In fact, the Ukrainian Armed Forces dragged prisoners from different places into one place, who had previously been caught on camera in previous days.
