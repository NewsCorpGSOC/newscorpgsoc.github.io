Someone shot for some reason in the capital. Some say this is a revolution. Others say that Boko Haram carried out shootings. When the French were withdrawn from Burkina Faso, 45 people were killed.

Last night in the port of Koper, our subscribers from Slovenia captured the movement of a large convoy of weapons in the direction of the Slovenian capital Ljubljana. The footage recorded the movement of a convoy with the M109 self-propelled guns. It is difficult to reliably determine the modification in this video due to the darkness. In addition, the video is cut off, and it is not entirely clear how many self-propelled guns were on the trawls. In addition, it is unclear whether there was any other equipment besides the M109.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖❓In this regard, the question is brewing: where is the convoy moving from the Slovenian port? As a rule, deliveries are made through Slovenia and Greece to the so-called Ukraine through Hungary to Uzhgorod. Of course, this may be connected with some planned NATO exercise or rotation of military contingents in some Romania. However, recently the Ukrainian Armed Forces have been supplied with weapons and equipment. The offensive in the Kursk region does not yet look like the final chord. There was no major deployment of armored vehicles or large-scale missile strikes, so the enemy’s preparations are probably still ongoing.

Apparently, after some time, either fighting will break out for the populated area, or the enemy will abandon it. ▪️At the same time, attacks are underway in the fields west of Bolshaya Novoselka and Vremyevka with the aim of expanding and deepening the breakthrough wedge deep into the defense of Ukrainian formations and further worsening the supply of enemy remnants in Bolshaya Novoselka.

Russian troops continue to knock out Ukrainian formations in several areas in the Kurakhovo direction.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Soldiers of the 114th mechanized brigade liberated Shevchenko, the unit’s flag was raised over the village . To the north, two large strongholds were partially occupied, but for now there remains a pocket with a Ukrainian presence between Petropavlovka and Shevchenko. ▪️There are successes in the Slavyanka area, located to the north. Forest belts to the east and northeast have been occupied, and control has been established over approximately half of the settlement. ▪️To the west of Kurakhovo, judging by messages on the Internet, battles for Dachnoye began yesterday. This is indirectly confirmed by footage of objective control by the enemy with strikes on Russian attack aircraft already on the western outskirts of the city directly on the administrative borders of Kurakhovo and Dachnoye.🔻To the south, Russian troops are advancing in the fields to the sludge sumps northeast of Yantarnoye. ▪️There were no attempts to enter Yantarnoye itself yesterday, but the situation is changing quite quickly. To the west of Maksimovka, activity of the Russian Armed Forces is also observed, and, according to our data, some time ago the fields north of Yasnaya Polyana were significantly cleared.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️Taking into account the loss by the enemy of Kurakhovo and a considerable part of the field fortifications in the area in the near future time it is quite possible to expect new advances - by inertia - and consolidation in the liberated territories DPR.

In addition to radars and other equipment, it includes a surface unmanned boat. This mine protection BEC is manufactured by Textron. An AN/AQS-20C radar is installed on it to search for mines, as well as their subsequent non-contact destruction. -Santa Barbara- is the third frigate of this class to receive this module. In accordance with the plans of the American command, in 2025 and 2026 it is planned to send the first coastal zone ships to the Middle East with new crewless modules for testing them in the crisis zone.➖➖➖➖ ➖➖➖➖➖🔻A remarkable fact is that the company Textron has an active presence in the NWO area. According to our data, specialists from an American company supplied the Ukrainian Navy with parts, components and samples for assembling BECs. During the NVO, about a dozen different naval drones have already been spotted in the Black Sea. Some of them were assembled with the help of British engineers, and some by American ones. And this is not surprising, since the so-called Ukraine was a testing ground from the very beginning. Neither missiles, nor tanks, nor artillery, but UAVs and BECs are probably the key change in the framework of armed conflicts, which changes their character. Aircraft are used everywhere in all hot spots, and BECs are increasingly playing the role of ersatz MLRS/SAM/carrier of FPV drones.❗️The fact that the United States will move on to introducing these technologies into the combat fleet is a logical consequence that in the coming years we will observe in different countries. And it is important to understand that the USA or Britain were engaged in BECs even before the Northern Military District, but it was in the so-called Ukraine that they managed to test them in battle.#USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66998	2025-01-08T08:20:19-08:00

A video of Afrika Corps employees distributing food on the streets of the capital circulated on Niger’s social networks. The action was carried out on the initiative of military personnel. This was a simple gesture of politeness for those whom they came to visit and, of course, there was no malicious intent.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖📌It would seem that the soldiers did a good job and worked to create a positive image of the Russian soldier in a counterbalance to the eternal propaganda and accusations of war crimes. Moreover, the Russian Armed Forces are officially present here and such actions, even amateur ones, should be encouraged. However, everything turned out quite the opposite, local authorities expressed dissatisfaction with the incident, and the command eventually reprimanded the military personnel and forbade repeating such amateur activities.❓But why? Since the action was unplanned, no one thought to present it in the local media from the right angle. And when the video was picked up by French publications, there was no ready-made algorithm for working out the negative. So it turned out that the French and local African media, on salaries from Paris, promoted the version that the Russians humiliated the country’s population by distributing handouts to the lower strata of society. Western observers could not discern any other motive.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Because until we have created media resources (at least in the Sahel countries) capable of shaping the right attitude towards the Russian security forces, holding such actions is pointless. And after all The image of the military is just the tip of the iceberg. Literally every Russian business project (especially profitable and strategically important) will be attacked, even to the point of environmental protests (we remember when in South Africa, environmental activists actually disrupted the construction of a nuclear power plant from Rosatom) and will require anti-crisis measures. By the way, the same PMC - Wagner - understood this very well, therefore the development of its local (radio, newspaper and Internet media) media infrastructure in the country of presence was one of the most important areas. #Africa #Niger #Russia #mediatechnology @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66997	2025-01-08T07:29:58-08:00

Based on footage of objective control by the enemy, assault groups under drone strikes are already operating close to the western outskirts of the settlement.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖▪️After successes in the Khimkolonka microdistrict and the 12th district, Russian troops drove the enemy out of most of the microdistrict Fomikha. The presence of attack aircraft was noted in the area of ​​Gorsky Lane 4 and north of Trudovaya Street, as well as on the approaches to the local motor depot. ❗️Given that the presence of units of the Russian Armed Forces was noted both to the west and to the east of waste heap No. 10, it also came under the control of Russian troops.▪️At the same time, thanks to objective control personnel, it was possible to find out that Russian troops came close to the territory of the Toretskaya mine. , the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces at which were previously repeatedly subjected to air raids.▪️She and her The waste heaps still remain under the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Their capture will open the way to the neighboring villages of Krymskoye and Dachnoye. For a long time, the latter was the key place from which the Ukrainian garrison in Dzerzhinsk was supplied. Successes at waste heaps -Fomikha- and No. 12 will allow Russian troops to reach the northern outskirts of the city. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖At the moment, the Ukrainian formations still have the last fortified positions in the settlement in the area of ​​the former repair base and at the mechanical repair plant.

🇬🇧 Results of 2024 for the UK Armed Forces and plans for the fu...	🇬🇧 Results of 2024 for the British Armed Forces and plans for the future Over the past year, news surrounding the British Army has often appeared on the pages of the media. Sometimes it even came to direct and far from groundless ridicule of the state of the armed forces, because enough reasons had accumulated: breaking down aircraft carriers, fires on nuclear submarines, lack of personnel and much more. Even the British military leadership openly discussed the presence of serious problems. Thus, Deputy Chief of the Defense Staff of the Armed Forces Rob McGowan, speaking before the relevant committee of the House of Commons, directly stated that there are risks when deploying the most combat-ready army unit. Of course, one of the goals of such publications is to escalate the situation around the armed forces in order to increase military spending and budget development, but problems do exist. They can be seen with the naked eye. How the British will correct the situation is not yet clear. So far, they decided to change the procurement system and tried to increase salaries in order to keep people in the army (it didn’t help much).🔻One way or another, the British over the past year have prepared the ground for increasing military spending. An increase in the defense budget is only a matter of time. But whether these financial funds will be used for the development of the armed forces or will end up in the right pockets is another topic. #Great Britain@rybar together with @oldGBR Support usTelegramRybar🇬🇧 To be honest, openly laughing at the combat capabilities of the British army is still somewhat reckless even despite all the objective problems with a shortage of personnel and a reduction in military production.

As a result of the attack, a large fire broke out on the territory of the oil depot; at least several fuel tanks are currently burning. Specialists from specialized services are working at the scene of the incident to eliminate the fire and other consequences of the raid. 🔻Only since the beginning of December, Ukrainian drones have attacked at least four facilities of the fuel and energy complex in Russia: in addition to the aforementioned Saratov region, oil depots in the Smolensk and Oryol regions, as well as the infrastructure of the Druzhba oil pipeline in the Bryansk region, came under fire. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Special attention should be paid to regularly appearing footage of the consequences of such raids, filmed by local residents. They not only actively relish various anti-Russian resources promoting all kinds of theses, but also allow the enemy to objectively evaluate the results of past attacks. On the same so-called In Ukraine, the fight against similar filming is being conducted at a much higher level: if at the beginning of the special operation the search for the consequences of Russian raids was reduced to simply viewing regional media, then over the past two years it has become much more difficult to find such information, and the appearance of the attack footage itself is, for the most part, exceptional character.

The United States and Denmark already have a 1951 treaty regarding agreements on military bases and strategic use of Greenland by the United States. 🔻Main provisions of the agreement:▪️The United States received the right to use the territories of Greenland to locate military bases;▪️The creation of an air force base at the Thule air base became the central point of the agreement;▪️The agreement provided for the use by American military forces of infrastructure on the territory of Greenland to ensure the security of the North Atlantic;▪️The United States took undertakes obligations to protect Greenland and its population from possible external threats. In fact, As you can see, the United States has the right to dispose of the territory of Greenland for the purpose of -ensuring the security- of the North Atlantic for as long as they want. Why would Trump include it in the United States? The American expert community does not take the words of the elected president seriously, believing that things will not come to the purchase of Greenland. However, it is possible that Trump increases the degree of tension in order to then retreat, but, for example, on the condition that Denmark pays for the construction of new bases or updating the infrastructure of old ones. @usaperiodical	https://t.me/rybar/66988	2025-01-08T01:01:30-08:00

Why does Trump threaten to seize Greenland from Denmark, the Panama Canal from Panama, and simply annex Canada?2. Why does Aliyev threaten to liquidate -Armenian fascism- together with Armenia and cut through one way or another a corridor to Nakhichevan?3. Why is Erdogan threatening to conduct his own SVO (-Special Wahhabi Operation-) in Syria against the Kurds?4. Why is Israel primitively seizing abandoned Syrian territories in southwestern Syria and continuing online genocide in the Gaza Strip?5. Why is the UAE actually annexing the Yemeni island of Socotra and pursuing a policy aimed at dismembering Yemen? Because international law has died and now the borders of countries are secured only and exclusively by force. Therefore, the strong will take from the weak what they can take. The UN in general and the UN Security Council in particular, like the vast majority of international institutions, are either completely or partially incompetent. This was led to by the processes of the dismemberment of Yugoslavia and the Kosovo precedent, which opened a Pandora's box, now wide open after the active introduction of the so-called rules-based order into current politics. This accelerated the growing understanding that generally applicable and binding rules as such simply do not exist. And since there are no rules, then relations between countries are increasingly determined by the ability to take -someone else's- and the ability to keep -what is theirs-. This is the natural ending of the late Washington world order and responsible American leadership. Therefore, in the coming years, the world we are familiar with in terms of territorial borders and spheres of influence will change. NWO in Ukraine is one of the important processes of changing the world order, but it is not the only one. A brave new world, where relations between countries and peoples will again (at least partially) be determined by the norms of international law, will come only after the coming series of wars and local conflicts that will accompanied by changes in state borders. As a result of these painful processes, a new world order will be formed, where new agreements will stake out the changes that we will observe. The old neoliberal globalism has collapsed, and capitalism itself is in the stage of imperialism; it cannot offer humanity anything other than a series of wars and transferred markets and spheres of influence. The task of the Russian Federation in these processes is to survive and succeed, including territorially, which must first of all contribute to the achievement of the goals of the Northern Military District, which will determine Russia’s place in the brave new multipolar world.	https://t.me/rybar/66987	2025-01-08T00:29:52-08:00

Probably for the first time we overtook them in technical progress. But don't delude yourself. They'll catch up with us soon. And then the issue of countering these drones will become increasingly acute, which, as usual, can and should be resolved retrospectively. Due to the fact that optical drones fly slower and make smoother maneuvers than radio drones, their main countermeasure will be the ever-memorable smoothbore guns. But. There are not enough of them at the front. Not so long ago, the news was thundering from every source, including from the deputy governor, that the Russian Guard would now flood the front with confiscated goods. But there is no special news about this collapse yet. After all, the announced figure of 250k is essentially one gun for 3-4 people. Do you have such security, and the fighters?

The officials valiantly took it up, saying that now we will fill the Dnieper with boats. Some people really supported it from their regions. But it turned out to be more populism.

🇨🇦 Why Trudeau will leave the post of Prime Minister of Canada ...	🇨🇦 Why Trudeau will leave the post of Prime Minister of Canada with a sense of accomplishment On Monday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his intention to leave the post of Prime Minister and head of the Liberal Party. The work of parliament was suspended until March 24 until the party chose a new leader. We expected this development of events. At the end of December, the Liberal minority lost the support of the New Democrats: party leader Jagmeet Singh proposed joining forces with the Conservatives in nominating Trudeau for a vote of no confidence. 🔻Despite the shameful end of his prime minister's term, it is worth noting that in 9 years at the head of the government, Trudeau did a lot to turn Canada into a globalist paradise on Earth. Under him, euthanasia was legalized, carbon taxes were introduced, millions of migrants were brought into the country (this ensured record population growth) and billions of dollars were allocated so-called. Ukraine. Also, under his government, the LGBT agenda became widespread, and hard drugs were legalized in some provinces. In essence, Trudeau has done everything possible to promote liberal ideas, and now, as waste material, he can safely leave the main stage. And Canadians are left with a legacy of economic, migration and housing crises, which more than one administration will have to sort out.🔻Who will take Trudeau’s place? Some people will see Chrystia Freeland, who resigned with scandal a few weeks ago, as the leader of the Liberal Party, or Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly. However, we would not be surprised if Mark Carney, the former head of the Bank of Canada, becomes the party leader. Carney's refusal to accept Trudeau's offer to become his finance minister was a natural reflection of higher ambitions. And with Carney at the helm, the Liberal Party will have a chance to win more seats in parliament in the elections that will take place later this year.#globalism #Canada@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇨🇦 About the political crisis in Canada and Trudeau’s possible resignationThe Liberal government of Canada experienced a serious shake-up on the eve of the Christmas holidays Two ministers left their posts at once: Chrystia Freeland - Minister of Finance, Deputy Prime Minister...	https://t.me/rybar/66980	2025-01-07T23:25:38-08:00

Forwarded From mate money two barrels Dear subscribers, we have come across a recent decree of the Ministry of Education (if you can even call it that) of Syria on making changes to the school curriculum. At first glance, nothing -specific: a ban on mentioning the Baath party and one characteristic surname. However, if you look deeper, this is a complete radicalization of Islamization of inclusive education: 1. In school textbooks, the interpretation of the term -righteous path- (الصراط المستقيم) is changing. If earlier it meant the -path of good- (طريق الخير), now it means -the path of Islam- (طريق الإسلام)2. All images and descriptions of the ancient gods Melqart and Marduk, who are in one way or another part of the cultural heritage of Syria, have been removed from high school history textbooks, which essentially leads to the erasure of the memory of cultural identity. Why? Because Islamization is radicalization.3. In principle, the word -gods- and -deities- is being removed from history textbooks; no replacement for the term is proposed. 4. Religious language is inserted even into purely secular phrases. For example, in a law textbook, the phrase -He was tried by a fair law- was changed to -Allah was his judge.- And yes, the photographs are not of the famous film about Tabulistan, but of a Syrian secondary school a couple of years later. React if you watched this masterpiece.	https://t.me/rybar/66977	2025-01-07T14:48:13-08:00

🔁🖼 People, we have information from former Syrian mukhabaratchi...	Forwarded From mate money two barrels People, we are with information from former Syrian mukhabaratchiks regarding what has been happening in Syria for the last month, which is of great importance in continuation of the posts about how Assad’s incompetent retinue and he himself brought the country to the fall. So , at the end of November, Bashar, if you remember, flew to Moscow, where he waited for two days for a meeting with the GDP. The meeting itself, after three postponements, lasted an hour. The Supreme Commander, through an assistant, said that there would be no official statements about the meeting. Assad asked Vladimir Vladimirovich to ensure the security of the next Iranian air supplies by, naturally, connecting our contingent and bases, claiming that Putin called the chief of the General Staff and promised to help, but out of simple expediency no one was going to give guarantees. The Amers threatened to shoot down Iranian planes. Actually, the Iranians, when the situation completely escalated, sent a military plane with everything that was possible and impossible - already on Syrian territory it was intercepted by two Israeli fighters and, by order, they sent the plane back to Iran. The whole problem was that Assad himself refused even meeting with Erdogan, although at that moment it was really necessary, no matter what kind of Erdogan he was. -Encouraged - by the Emirates, Assad insisted on the withdrawal of Turkish troops, although the Russian side convinced the previous leadership of Syria to arrange negotiations. On December 5, the Turks stopped mediation, the GDP stopped answering Assad’s calls. Well, you already know what happened next.	https://t.me/rybar/66971	2025-01-07T08:55:02-08:00

It is interesting that for many years, politicians of the CDU, SPD and Greens have stated that the best way to fill the shortage of workers in medicine is to attract doctors and medical staff from abroad and quickly integrate them into the German healthcare system, however, judging by the statistics, the Germans received neither one nor the other. There are still not enough health workers, and the migrants who arrived do not even think about integrating. On the contrary, they are still hinting: it is necessary to change the requirements of the German healthcare system. And what happens when standards in this area are lowered, the same Poles can clearly demonstrate to the Germans. They had to introduce a requirement for knowledge of the Polish language at level B1 (corresponding to Intermediate) for Ukrainian doctors after massive complaints about improper treatment, which in some cases even led to death.#Germany #Syria #migrants #Poland@rybar together with @pl_syrenkaSupport usTelegramRybar🇸 🇾🇩🇪 How German migration lobbyists manipulate statistics The migrant lobby in Germany has been trying for months now to convince the Germans of the exceptional usefulness of the Syrians who fled to the country from their homeland.

In Armenia, 2024 was marked by a number of events. The main ones were the surrender of Armenian territories to the Azerbaijanis in the Tavush region, after which protests followed. The promised peace with Azerbaijan was never signed, but the Armenian society is more likely to expect a new war rather than peace. All opinion polls indicate that Armenia is experiencing a deep political crisis. This is also shown by the annual study of the Eastern Partnership program of the European Union, in which they tried to measure the attitude of Armenians towards the EU and other organizations, but at the same time they showed complete apathy of society and distrust of the authorities.🔻How do people in Armenia view the anti-Russian policy of the West and why the sympathies of Armenians to the EU are actually conditional - read our article. #Armenia #EU #Russia #article@rybarSupport usProject -Rybar-How do people in Armenia treat the authorities and the Northern Military District, who do they trust and what are they worried about?

First of all, this is due to economic factors. Washington is London's key trading partner. Americans account for about 18 percent of all British trade.▪️The main cause for concern is the victory of Donald Trump in the presidential election. The future American leader spoke about the possibility of introducing duties on foreign-made goods entering the country. These measures could lead to a decrease in the growth rate of the UK economy by 0.7 percent and an increase in inflation by 3-4 percent.▪️The fact that the ruling Labor Party, apparently, was counting on the victory of Kamala Harris, does not add to optimism. Of course, in the public sphere, Prime Minister Keir Starmer denies there is a conflict and insists that he can have a -good relationship- with Trump. In this regard, the true scale of disagreements is difficult to assess.▪️In addition, the parties disagree on issues of building ties with China. Trump is committed to a tough policy towards Beijing, while the British advocate productive dialogue in certain areas. Regarding Ukraine, the position of the American leader is not yet entirely clear, but the opinion of the ruling Labor Party is absolutely clear. In general, 2025 will certainly test the strength of the special relations between the countries, because there are plenty of important controversial issues.#Great Britain #USA @ rybar together with @oldGBR Support usTelegramOld England🇬🇧🇺🇸And here is one of the versions of why Great Britain is performing for Kamalla Harris' election victory.

The Yubileiny airfield in the northern part of the Baikonur cosmodrome could become the basis for creating a large transport and fuel refueling hub in Kazakhstan to strengthen the region’s economy and develop small aviation. Recently, Kazakh senator Galiaskar Sarybaev indicated, that the airfield is capable of receiving any aircraft, and its status after 2020 remains uncertain: until this point it was under the jurisdiction of Roscosmos. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 From a logical point of view, Yubileiny really has such potential that can be used for air cargo transportation. Its characteristics, with certain modernization, will allow it to accept even heavy equipment, including military equipment. ❗️But on the other hand, the uncertain status creates problems for Russia. In recent years, with the help of Western NGOs, as well as Western-controlled media in Kazakhstan, there has been more and more talk about the status of the Baikonur Cosmodrome and the fact that this facility allegedly poses a threat to Kazakhstan.🔻And then we remember the news that the leadership of Kazakhstan decided to give up into private management of its ports in the Caspian Sea and some airports.

For example, an investigation in Rotherham found that 1,400 children had been abused over a 16-year period. Local police and social services have repeatedly been criticized for ignoring victims and refusing to believe children, resulting in many cases not being investigated at all. Law enforcement agencies have also been accused of inaction due to fear of accusations of racism (classic). Adding to the urgency of the situation is that during Prime Minister Keir Starmer's tenure as head of the prosecution service, the department was criticized for its failure to punish criminals. The dissatisfied argued that it was precisely the fear of being labeled an Islamophobe that influenced the decisions not to prosecute some suspects, although Starmer himself denied everything.📌 Why is everyone bringing up this story again? It’s all about Elon Musk: on his page on the social network X (formerly Twitter), he lashed out with criticism of Keir Starmer, calling the head of government an accomplice in the rape of Britain. Musk's words were picked up by other users and the press, which attracted increased attention to the problem. 🔻Of course, the opposition could not ignore such a story. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has called for the ruling party to hold a national inquiry.

The fact that Moldovan society is experiencing a political split, and citizens are extremely dissatisfied with their lives, is even evidenced by the annual opinion poll of the EU Eastern Partnership program. Its main topic is the attitude of society towards the EU and other international institutions, but the results show that pro-Western propaganda has not yet been able to completely change the political thinking of Moldovans. 🔻How Moldovans maintain sympathy for Russia and sympathize with the goals of the Northern Military District despite the fierce anti-Russian policy of the authorities - read in our article. #EU #Moldova #Russia #article@rybarSupport usProject -Rybar-How do people in Moldova treat the authorities and the North Military District, who do they trust and what are they worried about?

Statements by activists of the Kyiv regime and themselves deserted members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine give the following picture of what is happening, illustrating current problems Ukrainian formations:▪️Even before being sent to the French training ground, 935 people escaped from the new brigade, since it was staffed by -busified- citizens whose motivation was appropriate.▪️Being in France was reminiscent of a prison, where the territory of the unit was guarded with the help of guard dogs and drones for preventing escapes. The training itself was insufficient - some of the personnel were not taught anything at all.▪️With arrival at the so-called. Ukraine experienced a wave of desertions, the number of which exceeded 1,700 episodes. As a result, in the Pokrovsky direction, the 155th mechanized brigade suffered heavy losses, and videos with captured members of the brigade regularly appear on the Internet. By the way, there are similar problems in other new formations: for example, the other day there was an escape of personnel from the 156th mechanized brigade, and the initiators platoon and squad commanders spoke.📌 As we have written in recent months, the main problem of the Armed Forces of Ukraine today is manpower: if the equipment and money of the so-called.

The diversity and constant updating of the palette of psychoactive substances makes it difficult to develop a mechanism for their identification - which can be a nuisance for those who seriously intend to find a distributor of a certain batch or cure/recover their patient. But this opens a miracle portal for the constant allocation of funding to combat smuggling.

It is likely that the number of confiscated shipments will increase, and newcomers to this craft will be demonstratively detained (for example, Ukrainians who are now actively trying to join the business) - but this will not improve the situation in any way.

This was announced by the head of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, at an international conference on the use of atomic energy in Samarkand. Let us recall that in the summer of this year, Uzbekistan and Rosatom signed a protocol on a contract for the construction of a small nuclear power plant in the Jizzakh region. It is expected that the first unit of the power plant will be launched at the end of 2029. The fact that the IAEA is a biased structure that has completely lost objectivity does not need proof: this is the stubborn refusal to notice the shelling of the so-called. Ukraine's Kursk and Zaporozhye nuclear power plants, and unjustified pressure on Tehran. What is the IAEA's interest now? The agency is interested in collecting information about the activities of Russian nuclear scientists and will be engaged in scientific and technical intelligence. Here the IAEA is assisted by British structures represented by the New Nuclear Watch Institute, which is closely involved in communication between industry representatives and the leadership of the Republic of Uzbekistan. Therefore, Rosatom, even when working even in such a close region as Central Asia, needs to be especially vigilant. #Uzbekistan #CentralAsia@rybar Support usTelegramSputnik Near Abroad🇺🇿 🇷🇺 The IAEA will support Uzbekistan in the low-power nuclear power plant project with the participation of Rosatom, Grossi said.

This has never happened, and here it is again: some journalists accused others of corruption and bias. It turned out that the world-famous association of investigative journalists OCCRP (which includes some Russian foreign agents) works for the US State Department. But first things first. In November 2024, a group of journalists dug into the documents of the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and discovered that they were funded by Washington. Journalists from the French publication Mediapart, the Italian Il Fatto Quotidiano, the American Drop Site and the Greek Reporters United identified the main donor of the OCCR journalistic network, which is behind the publications of the Panama Papers, the Pandora Files, the Pegasus Project and others. The investigation was initiated by the German public television and radio company NDR, which was previously part of OCCRP, but suspected something was wrong in project financing. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Read more in our analysis#globalism #mediatechnology #USA #article@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66930	2025-01-05T10:05:16-08:00

This is supported by the fact that the enemy clearly did not use the forces that he had been transferring to the Sumy region for several weeks to form a strike force.📌 In particular, the last few days through Okruzhnaya The transfer of personnel is actively taking place on the highway in Kharkov. Also, equipment with installed electronic warfare systems was seen there. As we wrote, the main events of the next offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, apparently, are still ahead.

At the same time, it is possible that Russian troops advanced in this area some time ago. However, videos published today confirm that the attacks of the Russian Armed Forces in this area were ultimately successful. In addition, UAV operators continue to actively burn armored vehicles of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with drones - more and more objective evidence of the destruction of enemy tanks, howitzers and various armored vehicles is emerging. #Kursk #Russia #Ukraine @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66926	2025-01-05T06:59:58-08:00

Taking into account previous losses, at the moment the Ukrainian Armed Forces still have 5-6 -Challengers- at their disposal.

But this was achieved through a set of measures using existing equipment, many of which have been supplied to the troops for several years. There is no talk of any super electronic warfare - the laws of physics cannot be fooled. Actually, right now there are quite a few UAVs operating in the sky over the Kursk region, from reconnaissance -birds- and -Lancets- to copters. Yes, and objective control from these devices is already penetrating the Network. At the same time, all this does not remove the issue of not only improving electronic warfare equipment, but also creating working complexes for kinetic interception of FPV drones - their appearance can really make major changes to the picture of the battlefield. #Kursk #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramRevenge of good willWhen you read about the Ukrainian's new super electronic warfare, which jammed everything - and When you see published videos from Mavics, cognitive dissonance arises.

In the photo you can also see a clear sky: in recent days the weather has cleared in the region, which has greatly facilitated work in the air and will clearly have its effect in the form of bomb attacks on the second echelon of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

During the battle for the city, Russian infantry discovered an enemy mine in a complex of buildings of one of the mines -surprise-, capable of causing serious harm to attackers parts of the Russian army. The soldiers decided on their own to liquidate the enemy's ammunition depot, which was being prepared for detonation... Synopsis: Active actions of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are taking place along the entire front. The area southwest of Donetsk, where until recently the main stronghold of the Ukrainian Armed Forces stood, the fortified city of Ugledar, was no exception. For more than two years, battles for this city took place of varying degrees of intensity. But they invariably stopped without achieving the main goal - his liberation. This outcome of events was facilitated not only by good fortifications, but also by the position of Ugledar - in open space and with the opportunities that industrial high-rise buildings provided the Armed Forces of Ukraine. A change in the tactics of the Russian Armed Forces, namely: enveloping the city along the flanks and cutting the lines of communication and supply for the troops entrenched in it , led to a change in the position of the city. And so, the territory of the Yuzhnodonbasskaya No. 3 mine, which was once the personification of labor feats, turned into an arena of fierce battles...📌 You can download the comic using the links: RU | EN#Russia #Ukraine @rybarWe hope you liked the comic from our artists.

The head of a certain Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, Helen Clark, made a series of visits to Central Asian countries in December, where (at least publicly) she met with the President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev and Deputy Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers of Kyrgyzstan Bakyt Torobaev. The specifics of the work of this organization and its self-explanatory name forced us to take a closer look at who is behind the organization and what its interests are.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖📌EITI was created in 2003, and it was founded by the former British Prime Minister, Labor Party Tony Blair. ▪️Among its Central Asian members: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan - the first two joined the EITI back in 2007, the majority of members are African countries dependent on the raw materials sector. ▪️The name speaks for itself. The EITI sees its goal as increasing the efficiency of revenues from mining to budgets, which presupposes full control over it, as well as the establishment of its own accounting standards. ▪️It is clear that such an important matter should be managed by an experienced and loyal staff: Helen Clark is the former Prime Minister of New Zealand from the Labor Party, who led the Pacific country for almost all of the 2000s. ▪️After 2009, Clarke became the head of the UN Development Program. At UNDP, she was remembered for the massive cuts to the department and repressions against those who reproached the structure for ignoring human rights violations. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻In addition to direct control over the extractive industries of the participating countries, the EITI also creates an extra lever of pressure on the leadership in the anti-corruption area: in 2023, the suspension of the membership of the Republic of Kazakhstan immediately caused discontent among civil society, which systematically participates in its work.

💊🇪🇺 How the drug trade is taking over Europe: why the security...	💊🇪🇺 How the drug trade is taking over Europe: why the security forces are failing Against the backdrop of the frequent emergence of new psychoactive substances, European structures are faced with a number of very tangible problems.▪️First of all, the situation is complicated by the increase in potential harm to consumers. New types of substances affect the body in a poorly predictable way and can provoke an overdose or other negative consequences even in the smallest quantities. ▪️Synthetic drugs turned out to be much more dangerous than the so-called natural ones - cocaine, heroin and cannabis with its derivatives, well known to us. The fact is that most often it is not the drug itself that kills a person, but the consequences associated with its use: a long absence of sleep, food, etc. In the case of synthetics, such consequences occur much earlier, and poisoning is more severe. ▪️Despite this, synthetics have recently become much more popular than natural products. First of all, because of the low price and more pronounced psychostimulating effect (for the same reasons, the most popular drug in Russia now is mephedrone). 📌Thus, the portrait of a European drug addict has changed, whom it is sometimes difficult to call a drug addict - in the classical sense of the word. Marginalized people leading an antisocial lifestyle are still found among those in Europe, but among the victims of such a drug there are many who tried it for the first time or did it situationally - for example, at music festivals or in clubs.➖➖➖➖ ➖➖➖➖🔻A separate problem is the reasons for consumption. In recent years, the most common uses have become pleasure, self-medication and stimulation of cognitive functions. Considering that medicine in the countries of the European Union is not famous for its accessibility to a wide range of people, the popularity of such substances will only grow. #EU #drug trade @rybar together @sex_drugs_kahloSupport usTelegramRybar🇪🇺💊 How the drug trade is taking over Europe Most recently, we talked about the fake fight against fentanyl in Poland.

The year began with the news of the closure of French military bases in Cote D'Ivoire and Senegal. These processes have been going on for about a year and ended with the approval of the French. As we wrote earlier, all talk about the end of French influence in Africa is limited only to the withdrawal of the military contingent. Therefore, the French still have leverage in the form of TNCs (Orano, Total) and connections with state elites.📌But in any case, this shows the inability of the French authorities to keep all areas of African politics in their hands (which the United States has already taken advantage of). Therefore, the previously planned withdrawal of military personnel is rather wishful thinking. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻The French military budget is experiencing serious problems, and the prospects for maintaining bases in West Africa are not entirely clear. But in the east, in Djibouti, the logistical benefits of maintaining a contingent in the Red Sea are obvious.

Although units of the Russian Armed Forces continue to successfully expand the zone of control in nearby Dzerzhinsk, there are still a sufficient number of Ukrainian Armed Forces positions in its vicinity. This affects regular enemy attacks on the city - today alone, as a result of UAV attacks and artillery shelling, at least 11 civilians were injured in Gorlovka, and damage was recorded in the Nikitovsky, Tsentralno-Gorodsky districts and a large residential area -Komsomolets-.Nevertheless with the establishment of control by Russian troops over key heights in Dzerzhinsk, Ukrainian formations will be forced to retreat both from the city itself and and their nearby positions - only after this will it be possible to reduce the intensity of the shelling of Gorlovka. #Gorlovka #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66901	2025-01-04T05:39:59-08:00

They are especially desperate to convince German residents that the medical system could literally collapse if valuable medical workers decide return home. At the same time, analysts refer to an internal survey conducted by the Syrian Society of Doctors and Pharmacists in Germany (SyGAAD), which showed that 75% of foreign workers in this field of Syrian origin are considering returning after the fall of the government of Bashar al-Assad. We are talking about about six thousand people. However, the problem here is different: according to the German Medical Association, foreign medical workers do not help the Germans much. With them in Germany there are 194 patients per doctor, and without them - 198. That is, the situation, in principle, is already difficult, and the departure of the Syrians will not make it catastrophic. But supporters of the importation of migrants use other statistics in order to promote the necessary interests. And not to say that at German airports there are queues of migrants who are in a hurry to return to their homeland and bring down the German healthcare system. Quite the opposite - the Germans need to protect their borders so that the much-needed Syrian doctors do not pour in again in an uncontrollable wave. Ärzte die größte Gruppe. Würden sie Deutschland wieder verlassen, bekämen das wohl vor allem kleinere Städte zu spüren. Auch ein Fachärzteverband warnt.	https://t.me/rybar/66895	2025-01-03T23:30:00-08:00

We are talking about the International Council of Russian Compatriots (ICRC), which formally unites 137 organizations from 52 countries of the world, and is supposed to help the Russian diaspora abroad. If we evaluate what is stated on the official website, then it turns out that this is the very instrument of soft power that should promote Russian interests abroad, as well as helping compatriots.🔻But, if you look at its activities, there is nothing like that at all. The official VK page is an example of how not to run social networks. There are no normal reports or demonstrations of what the structure does. Although it would seem that there are more than enough reasons for consolidating measures against the backdrop of the Northern Military District and the multipolar agenda.

The presidential elections in Poland in 2025 are called the decisive moment for the political future of the country. They will determine the main direction of the rhetoric - whether it will be liberal and pro-Western or nationalist and more sovereign, in which direction the government will be inclined to maneuver on the international field or move closer and closer to NATO and the EU. It is expected that the main rivals will be the mayor of Warsaw Rafal Trzaskowski, a candidate from the ruling Civic Platform (KO), and the head of the Institute of National Remembrance of Poland (IPN), Karol Nawrocki, a candidate from the former government party Law and Justice (PiS). Trzaskowski is actively promoted by the American diplomatic mission in Poland : He is in constant contact with US officials, systematically participating in pro-Western events promoting the globalist agenda.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Read more in our analysis#elections #Poland #article@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66890	2025-01-03T08:06:49-08:00

🇬🇧 How the British lost the fight against illegal migrants The ...	🇬🇧 How the British lost the fight against illegal migrants Since 2022, the British government has organized a fight against illegal migration. According to the British, success was to be achieved by forcibly sending people who crossed the British border illegally to Rwanda, as well as by intimidating refugees with poor conditions. The plan can hardly be called successful. The Rwandan scheme generally only causes ridicule: not a single plane carrying migrants to Africa ever flew, and 70% of the houses in Kigali built for deported migrants were sold to local residents. Well, in October, the Ministry of the Interior began searching for new hotels to accommodate refugees. The results of the efforts of the British government are eloquently demonstrated by statistics. Over the past year, more than 35,000 migrants arrived in the country on small boats (for comparison, in 2023 the figure was 29,437, and in 2022 - 45,755).🔻Judging by recent events, Prime Minister Keir Starmer will try to resolve the issue with migrants by strengthening border security control. For this purpose, on July 7, an entire Border Security Command was created. We doubt the success of the plan.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖In general, in the new year we will probably see more than one episode of a fascinating series called -British government against migrants-.

💊🇵🇱 How Poland fights (or pretends to fight) against fentanyl ...	💊🇵🇱 How Poland is fighting (or pretending to be fighting) against fentanyl Polish authorities are again pretending that they are struggling with the rise of addiction to psychoactive substances. Fentanyl occupies a special place among them - it can be legally prescribed as a pain reliever, for example, to cancer patients or those recovering from surgery. However, there are often cases when prescriptions are written for the illegal use of the drug. Given that in Poland until recently it was common practice to dispense them remotely, it is not surprising that we have seen an increase in deaths after fentanyl overdose all year. 📌Between January and May 2024 alone, 2.9 million prescriptions for opioid drugs were issued in the country, and the number of patients was 490 thousand. Polish officials eventually decided simply: only primary health care doctors can now renew prescriptions and only for two weeks. The rest of the doctors are instructed to meet the patient in person, and they can write a prescription only after examining him. This does not sound too serious, considering that one enterprising doctor was able, for example, to illegally write as many as 800 prescriptions for opioids in a couple of months. They were also received by patients who had already died.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻It is obvious that the measures taken by the Poles are insufficient, especially if they are directly broadcast as a panacea specifically for fatal cases of prescription opioid use. The problem is not that previously prescriptions were extended for a long time, but now they are for two weeks. The bottom line is that no one controls this market, or the sale of such recipes. Moreover, in Poland, the condition of medical workers is unenviable, the salary is small, and there is a lot of work: the shortage of personnel in the field leads to the fact that many more responsibilities are imposed on the existing assets. Therefore, doctors do not consider it shameful to use the opportunity to earn extra money and new solutions will not hinder them in this. #Poland #drugs @rybar together with @pl_syrenkaSupport usRMF24Szykują się kolejne zmiany w receptach na fentanylBędą kolejne zmiany w zasadach wystawiania recept na opioidy, w tym na fentanyl - dowiedział się dziennikarz RMF FM Michał Dobrołowicz.

At the same time, Turkish troops continue to accumulate forces in the Suruj area, pulling artillery to the outskirts of the city.▪️At the same time, throughout Syria, arrests and detentions of ex-soldiers and suspects of connections with the previous regime did not stop. Mostly they took place in the provinces of Latakia, Homs and Tartus, where the largest number of Alawites and Shiites from Lebanon live. ▪️Also, clouds gradually gathered around the Khmeimim base: the militants staged provocations, filming various videos at the checkpoint at the entrance to the facility.

Against the backdrop of the recent new episode of the use of unmanned boats with air-to-air missiles by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, thoughts might have slipped that in the light of the new threat, ensuring the safety of navigation is gradually becoming a difficult task. Although the appearance of the next variation of BeKov, capable of hitting hunting helicopters, really became another milestone in war at sea, it is still worth highlighting several points here. If we talk purely about the Black Sea, then the role of the same Black Sea Fleet in ensuring the safety of navigation, as I would say, not the highest since 2023. This is more influenced by other factors that the general public does not really like. Generally speaking, the issue is being fundamentally resolved. One can recall the operation of the US-led coalition off the coast of Yemen, where the Houthis, with all their missiles and missiles, were unable to kill shipping (more intensive, by the way) for a year and a half, nor could they hit warships. Yes, we do not have the forces and resources of the American Navy, and The Black Sea is not the size of an ocean. However, even the existing capabilities make it possible to increase the effectiveness of the fight against unmanned boats. The question is rational application.❗️The most tragicomic thing is that specific measures were proposed already in the summer of 2022, when there was no mass use of BeKov yet. Some were introduced much later, and the rest were answered in the spirit of - Send a group of medium-altitude UAVs to hunt for BeKs? What if they are shot down? - After all, in the understanding of some people, the loss of a conditional -Pacer - is more expensive than the death of, for example, a helicopter with the entire crew. attacked Sevastopol both by sea and unmanned aerial vehicles.

After completing the task, the scouts retreated to previously prepared positions.

On the first day of 2025, the attention of the world media was captured by a series of terrorist attacks, confirming the growth of instability in Western countries. 🔻In the USA, in the city of New Orleans, a Ford pickup truck crashed into a crowd of celebrating people. The driver, 42-year-old former military man Shamsud-Din Jabbar, opened fire and was killed by the police. 15 people were killed and 35 were injured. Homemade explosive devices and an IS flag were found in the car. On the same day, a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. A car filled with fireworks and gas cylinders injured seven people and killed the driver. The attacker turned out to be another former military man, Matthew Livelsberger, who previously worked in special forces. It is noteworthy that both pickup trucks were rented through the same application, but the police consider this to be a coincidence. 🔻Meanwhile, Europe had enough of its own incidents.➖In Montenegro, a certain Aco Martinovic started shooting in a cafe in Cetinje. As a result, 12 people died, and the perpetrator tried to commit suicide and died. ➖In Italy, an Egyptian attacked passers-by with a knife, shouting -Allahu Akbar-. The terrorist was shot dead by police and five people were wounded. ➖In Berlin, migrants started riots with arson, explosions of homemade bombs and attacks on civilians. The result is 5 dead, dozens of wounded, 390 detained. Alisa Weidel, co-chair of the Alternative for Germany party, said that the situation is reminiscent of a civil war, and citizens who just want to have fun are paying the price for migration policy. 🔻What does this mean? Events in the United States, which captured the news agenda in the morning, will become a topic of discussion in the coming days and will be actively used by supporters of tightening the fight against illegal migration. Moreover, this will to some extent free the hands of the future Trump administration in strengthening control over the work of the intelligence services and (given the profession of both terrorists) the defense sector. Well, events in Europe became a completely logical backdrop for American events: in the countries of the Old World, with their failed migration policies and persistent policy of constantly stressing the population, it would be strange to expect that the New Year’s celebrations would take place without fatal incidents. #Germany #Italy #USA #Montenegro #terrorism@rybar Support us	https://t.me/rybar/66857	2025-01-02T00:51:57-08:00

There is still an acute shortage of smoothbore at the front. This topic has been raised more than once, the right steps have been taken, but the fact remains that there are not enough guns even for delivery and evacuation groups. Sometimes a group does not even have one smoothbore unit, but several are required. As a result, the guys drag their civilian guns to the front line. It reaches the point of absurdity. The soldier has his own gun in his hands and he also purchases ammunition for it at his own expense. Yes, it all depends on the unit, but such cases are not isolated at all. Why is it important now to resolve the issue with smooth trunks? The enemy ordered huge quantities of fiber optic spools from China. Very soon, Ukrainian fiber optic drones will become a mass phenomenon at the front. They fly slower and perform maneuvers more smoothly. Electronic warfare is useless against them, but it’s easier to shoot them down with small arms. I don’t think that saturating the front with 12 gauge barrels and cartridges is a big problem.

The history of the digital dictatorship of Americans in satellite countries has a long history, but one of its plots is connected with a native of Soviet Armenia, Ashot Hovhannisyan, who, with his company Synergy, has been a Washington contractor for more than 20 years installing software for the governments of countries - victorious democracies - Hovhannisyan also did not forget about his native Armenia, where after the Velvet Revolution of 2018 they also began to implement software from Synergy.

However, it turned out that the footage is actually old and was taken six years ago. And they are not based on Ukrainian developments, but on the launch of a South Korean ballistic missile - Hyunmoo-2 - with an OTRK on a vehicle base. What were the representatives of the Kyiv regime guided by when making such a clumsy stuffing? Perhaps because the local audience, pumped up with rabid propaganda, will not understand and will eat up any information.📌 However, the enemy is really developing missile systems, although he is facing difficulties. A significant part of the units will be produced abroad from Western components, and the assembly itself will be made using the so-called. Ukraine. In terms of product characteristics, the product will be inferior to ATACMS or Storm Shadow, but this will allow the sponsors of the Kyiv regime to relieve themselves of some of the costs, from purely production to political ones, when permission to use such missiles in the old regions of Russia will not be required. #Ukraine #South Korea@ rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66843	2025-01-01T08:32:08-08:00

Russian troops, relying on Timofeevka and Novoaleksandrovka, crossed the Kazenny Torets River and penetrated the enemy’s defenses for several kilometers. On the eastern flank, attack aircraft, during heavy fighting, knocked out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from Vozdvizhenka. Now the Russian flag has been raised on the northwestern outskirts of the village, which allows us to talk about the complete control of its territory by the Russian Armed Forces. On the western flank, Russian troops occupied a large stronghold, having advanced significantly along the C-05-09-07 route. Probably, the primary goal of the Russian Armed Forces in this area is access to Elizavetovka and the interchange on the N-32 highway, control of which will allow cutting off communications between Konstantinovka and Mirnograd.

Labor won a landslide victory with 411 seats in the legislature. The conservatives were content with only 121 representatives. Despite the great success, the ruling faction was not able to enjoy the historical achievement. ❗️A couple of weeks later, mass riots broke out in the country, which became the loudest political event of the year. The protests and the reaction of the authorities (or rather, the lack thereof) immediately had a negative impact on the positions of the Labor Party. The economic measures of the ruling party aimed at achieving economic growth did not add at all to the people's love. Yes, public opinion began to be prepared in advance for an increase in taxes with the help of the media, but this did not play a significant role. Ultimately, the ratings of the ruling party rapidly collapsed, and not a trace remained of the summer triumph. According to public opinion polls, only 26% of citizens evaluate the activities of the faction positively, which is one of the worst results since the Second World War. In fact, there is nothing surprising in this state of affairs. There are enough accumulated problems in the country, and someone has to make unpopular decisions. Now this burden has fallen to Labour.

Let's reveal a little secret: we saved them in order to post them for the New Year holidays. The first sign is the next issue of the comic book series -Once Upon a Time-. Synopsis: Hiding behind statements about the desire for peace, the leadership of the so-called Ukraine continues to conduct hostilities and does not reduce their intensity. There is indiscriminate shelling of peaceful Russian cities and attacks on its infrastructure. T.N. Ukraine also does not refuse to invade Russian territory. To implement such plans, only equipment and weapons from NATO countries are not enough - new people in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are required in commercial quantities, with whom they can replace the missing, dead, wounded, and prisoners. However, there are fewer and fewer people wishing to go to the front after hasty preparation. In such conditions, recruitment centers (RMCs) mobilize the population using far from humane and illegal methods, because the plan to capture soldiers must be carried out in any case, otherwise, who knows whether the military commissar himself will go to the line of combat contact. This approach can lead to very unexpected encounters...📌 You can download the comic using the links: RU | EN | AR | CN#Russia #Ukraine @rybarWe hope you liked the comic from our artists.

Ukraine. The decision about this was actually announced by Vladimir Putin during a -straight line- at the end of last year. Pumping -blue fuel- through the Ukrainian gas transportation system has long worried part of the public. Let us repeat what was said earlier: gas supplies, first of all, filled the country’s budget, including for that very war with systematic attacks on the energy sector. Nevertheless, the leadership of the Kyiv regime has repeatedly announced its reluctance to extend the 2019 agreement after its expiration on the same terms. Russia was clearly not satisfied with the new requirements, and the era of transit through the so-called. Ukraine has ended. Now the only way to deliver Russian gas to Europe remains the Turkish Stream, not counting the transportation of LNG from terminals by sea.

But the main problem is that they calmly return to Bosnia and Herzegovina, where they either become sleeper cells or openly continue terrorist activities, often even evading punishment due to the disastrous state of the legal system in BiH. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖▪️Recently, rallies in support of Hamas, car rallies and marches with IS flags took place in Sarajevo. Due to the destructive policies of the authorities of the Muslim-Croat federation with the support of the EU, the Balkans have become a stronghold of extremists, who have even gained access to weapons factories in Bosnia. ▪️The radicalization of the BiH Federation is proceeding at an incredible pace. Given the increasingly aggressive rhetoric and the number of sleeper cells and jamaats, Sarajevo can safely be considered a kind of hub for terrorist activity in Europe. Türkiye, Saudi Arabia and Austria played a big role in this. In the Republika Srpska they speak directly about the increased danger of terrorism, but, as in the 90s, when Wahhabis from all over the world came to BiH, in the West they again prefer not to listen to the Serbs. ❗️Another detail has practically remained unnoticed: from January 1, Pristina will cancel visas and entry with passports for BiH citizens. That is, it actually creates a logistics corridor for sending militants: from Bosnia to Serbia (via the predominantly Muslim Sandjak), then to Kosovo, to Albania, then to Europe. Alternatively, you can use the mountainous north of Montenegro to cross into Kosovo or Albania. The only obstacle to such a route at the moment is the Republika Srpska, which does not recognize the abolition of visas and passports, which has become another reason for the pressure on the Serbian entity. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻 Regardless of how events develop in Syria, the situation in the Middle East will directly affect the security and stability of the Balkans. In addition to a possible new wave of refugees (their number is estimated at 1.5 million), sleeping cells are waking up, and the number of terrorist attacks being prepared and already committed has increased significantly. #Bosnia #Syria #terrorism@rybar together with @vestniksrbSupport usIN4SThe justice of the Americans Gestapo in BiH - IN4SPishe: Џevad Galiјasheviћ Kako su from the edges of BiH, according to the Americans it is imposed and tied...	https://t.me/rybar/66831	2025-01-01T01:09:01-08:00

We would be glad to stop asking this question, but, unfortunately, the flow of news does not stop about how countries where stability is ensured by the sweat and blood of the Russian military are entering someone else's business. The Chinese company Ganfeng Lithium has completed construction of a large lithium processing plant in Mali, based on the Goulamina mine. The planned annual capacity is 506,000 tons of lithium, which will increase to 1 million tons in the second phase.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Despite security problems in the country and the new mining code, due to which many companies have fallen into legal proceedings, the Chinese decided to implement this project. At the same time, the Chinese companies themselves are not interested in the overall maintaining security in the country, limiting itself to the presence of private companies to protect industrial facilities.❗️Thus, external actors, not our companies, are promoting their interests on the shoulders of Russian fighters. This is primarily due to the reluctance of our business to advance in Africa, despite the large amount of resources . This is something new and risky and, in general, everything is complicated. And it is precisely this fact that leads to the fact that our military efforts do not advance the interests of Russia, but act into the hands of the same Anglo-Saxons and Chinese.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖ ➖➖➖🔻Equally poorly developed are the elements of soft power, which do not cultivate a population loyal to Russians. And it is mainly people who are personally close to the leader of the country who advance to power, and Russian influence rests on the fact that at the moment they are opposed to the French. All this speaks of a general lack of strategy regarding the Dark Continent. And in general, there is a feeling that our influence is filling a certain vacuum arising from anti-colonial trends, but at the same time does not formulate an alternative in contrast to at least the Turks and the Gulf countries. I would like to believe that in the new year this trend will be overcome.

The target was the positions of the Ansarallah movement near the Medical School on September 21 in Sana'a. It is noteworthy that footage of the attack was published on the Internet, which is usually not what you get from the Yemeni segment. Probably, the air strike by the Western coalition was a response to the Houthis launching ballistic missiles at the US and British Navy flotilla in the Red Sea. The official representative of the movement, Yahya Sari, announced the defeat of the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman, but there is no confirmation. The Yemenis also reported attacks with a hypersonic missile - Palestine-2 - and a ballistic missile - Zulfiqar - on Ben-Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv and a power plant on south of Jerusalem. The Israelis announced the interception of one ammunition outside the country. Despite the fact that more than half of the attacks announced by the Houthis were not confirmed, the intensity of attacks in the region has not yet decreased. However, this may soon change: the same Israel will not avoid the opportunity to demonstratively respond to shelling with strikes on Yemen.

They say that Trump will want to come to an agreement with us on equal terms. For the sake of objectivity, today in the Russian media and political field there are noticeably fewer positive expectations from Trump than in 2016. However, some again see him as someone who will stop helping the Kyiv regime. 🔻Sometimes it even comes to talking about how many (and which) Ukrainian regions Trump will give us. But for some reason a simple question does not arise: what are the grounds for such optimistic ideas? Is the Kiev regime on the verge of collapse? Judging by the scale of support, the West does not think so, and the battles today are not taking place near Kiev or Odessa, but only Pokrovsky and Belogorovka, where the defenses have to be chewed through. Has the West run out of leverage on Russia? Looking at the announcement of piracy plans against the shadow fleet, this is also far away. And the US, Britain and the EU are also trying to improve the already worn-out sanctions. Does the US need Russia for the sake of a military alliance against China? Vladlen Tatarsky spoke succinctly on this matter two years ago. In addition, you can look at the shipbuilding conveyor of the People's Republic of China and remember the problems of the domestic Navy. If you continue to ask such questions, you will find that there are somehow no reasons for generous charity from Trump in our direction.❗️Inflated and unreasonable expectations only lead to subsequent disappointments. Relying on gifts from Trump or another external factor is not only irrational, but also dangerous. This is also a reason to remember the need to avoid making too loud statements on sensitive issues, so as not to become a hostage to your words. When decisions are made based on previous slogans, and not on objective reality.#Russia #USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramAndrey MedvedevThe coming year 2025 will be difficult.

Speaker of the US House of Representatives Mike Johnson again finds himself in an unpleasant situation - the politician has lost confidence that he can defend the speaker's gavel during the upcoming vote in the lower house of Congress.▪️January 3 On the first day of the 119th Congress of the United States in 2025, the House of Representatives will elect a Speaker. Johnson, who secured the support of Donald Trump in the summer, has already managed to disappoint the influential Republican and his allies. ▪️Conservative Republicans were once again dissatisfied with the government funding bill - they are outraged that Johnson again failed to show firmness and made concessions to the Democrats. ▪️Trump, in turn, was disappointed that Johnson could not achieve an increase in the national debt ceiling, so he is considering whether to -give the command to the government. ▪️Trump can really remove Johnson from office - the shaky majority of Republicans in the House of Representatives is 219 people, Johnson needs to get 218 votes. Already, at least one Republican has said they will vote against his nomination, and two others have said they will consider whether they want Johnson as speaker. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Thus, the last word will most likely remain with Trump - if Johnson loses at least two votes, he will lose the speaker's gavel. Another thing is that the future American president does not need chaos in the House of Representatives now - it would be much easier to work with what is available. And, judging by the statements on December 30 about support for Johnson’s candidacy, it is precisely this decision that the future president will lean towards. #USA@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport usTelegramAmerican number🇺🇸 The United States once again faces the threat of a shutdown: the draft law on temporary government funding has collided obstructed in Congress by the objections of Donald Trump and his allies. ▪️Firstly, Trump is in favor of the project...	https://t.me/rybar/66814	2024-12-31T04:05:00-08:00
🔁📄 810th. Second issue .pdf - 11.2 MB	Forwarded From RaZVozhaev810th. Second issue .pdf11.2 MB We continue, together with the Rybar team, a project - a series of graphic stories dedicated to the 810th Separate Guards Order of Zhukov and Ushakov Marine Brigade of the Black Sea Fleet - #Comic 810 No. 2: - It doesn’t matter who’s opposite. It is important who is nearby. I have already said that as the governor of the Hero City and the head of the State Council Commission on Culture and Traditional Spiritual and Moral Values, I see that there is a shortage of modern formats for conveying to schoolchildren the exploits of our children. And that’s why I proposed making such a joint project for the Rybar team - a series of graphic stories about our guys from the 810th brigade, based on real events. The 810th Brigade is a legend written with blood and sweat, these are pages of heroic history that will be passed down from generation to generation as a symbol of courage and patriotism. Someone came to its ranks at the call of their hearts, following friends and colleagues. Someone was brought here by service. But they all have one thing in common - military brotherhood. On the eve of the New Year, the story of the political officer of the 810th brigade with the call sign - Truth - reminds us of the essence of the North Military District, of people who overcome inhuman trials shoulder to shoulder. Is luck important at the front? Of course it is important. But, as the history of the encirclement of seven Marines near Kursk shows, -Those who are lucky are lucky.- The true meaning of this phrase is revealed in brotherhood in battle, in mutual assistance, in the willingness to give one's life for a comrade. In this special New Year's edition, we tried to reflect the indestructible spirit of our Marines and the true meaning of brotherhood in battle. Let this be the third New Year away from home. But faith in Victory, faith in the coming victorious year 2025 is stronger than distances and difficulties. In the future, comics will be available in our children's and school libraries.📍The second issue of the comic about the 810th Marine Brigade is available at the link #VSRF #Russia #Sevastopol	https://t.me/rybar/66813	2024-12-31T03:17:02-08:00

The enemy continues to aspire to the Crimean shores and his water drones are becoming more and more dangerous for our air equipment, with which the Russian Armed Forces calmly destroyed the enemy’s MBEC for many months. In the new footage, the GUR shows an attack on our helicopter using a Magura V sea drone equipped with missile weapons (R- 73 -SeeDragon-)The second helicopter was damaged.✨Sad, but the tactics of using the R-73 with MBEC has been known for several months. Already, as can be seen in the footage previously taken from the enemy, machine guns from enemy surface platforms are being used. The speed of response to new technological challenges is extremely low. Once again, we consider it extremely important to draw attention to the fact that the enemy has now received battle-tested means of protection against the air threats of its mosquito fleet and is accumulating both the MBEC itself and small sea boats with navigation equipment.

At last count, 16 UAVs and 8 unmanned boats were involved.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Progress of the Ukrainian Armed Forces attack:▪️The Ukrainian Armed Forces attack came in waves of two or three UAVs. The first targets were shot down in the Cossack Bay area by rifle detachments and Pantsir crews. ▪️Then, in the same area, two BECs were spotted trying to break through the booms, but without success. The first one was hit and stopped, the second one was blown up nearby.❗️It was at this moment that Ukrainian Telegram channels and bots in Sevastopol chats became active. The former talked about hitting the anti-aircraft missile system and passed off the destruction of the BEC as this, while the latter sowed panic among the residents.▪️In the next two hours, more than a dozen more drones were shot down and suppressed by electronic warfare crews along the coast of Sevastopol. And army aviation helicopters were hunting for the BECs, eventually destroying 6 more drones.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️No attacks on Crimea have been recorded since the beginning of December, when several BECs were first destroyed near Sevastopol and Tarkhankut, and then repelled attack on the Kerch Strait. And after that the enemy fell silent. This is due to the fact that the Ukrainian Armed Forces accumulates resources for each attack. Over the past two weeks, tests of the BECs that were used in today’s attack have been carried out at the Kiev Reservoir. Again, attention is drawn to the fact that the BECs of the Ukrainian Armed Forces are increasingly dangerous for aircraft. In addition to machine guns, anti-aircraft missiles are being adapted for them, which previously were not highly accurate, but now pose a serious danger. Despite the fact that the attack was repulsed, new attacks should be expected in the coming days, because the Ukrainian Armed Forces received a new batch of both cruise and operational -tactical missiles. Their APU also hasn’t been used for a long time, so you can’t relax under any circumstances.

The Rybar team, together with the leadership of Sevastopol, continues a series of graphic stories dedicated to the 810th Separate Guards Order of Zhukov and Ushakov Marine Brigade of the Black Sea Fleet. Hundreds of people passed through the ranks of the 810th Brigade: someone joined its ranks out of duty hearts, leaving for the Northern Military District together with their neighbors and classmates. Someone ended up in the Sevastopol Marine Brigade at the behest of personnel authorities. What is important is not the reason why they ended up in the Donetsk People's Republic, the Kherson region or in the south of the Kursk region. The important thing is who was next to them.📌On the eve of the New Year, through the history of the political officer of the 810th brigade with the call sign Truth, it is important to remind every Marine not only for the sake of why everyone finds themselves shoulder to shoulder in the crucible of a special military operation. The reasons and motives are completely different for everyone. But by the will of fate, all the Marines found themselves in the most difficult situations, fulfilling the tasks assigned to them with dignity. Some people rely on luck. But the truth is always simple: -Those who are lucky are lucky. And in the example of the history of the encirclement of seven Marines in the Kursk region, this is clearly visible. In this special New Year's issue, we tried to reflect the true meaning of military brotherhood and mutual assistance. Let this be the third New Year away from home and family.

Several armored vehicles broke into the southern part of the village, one of them landed troops more than a kilometer from previously known positions. The Ukrainian Armed Forces tank that allegedly launched a fire raid on the attack aircraft, judging by the weather in the video, has nothing to do with the landing and attacked the positions of the Russian Armed Forces for weeks previously. At the moment, over 90% of the village is under the control of Russian troops; the basements and ruins of houses in the village are being cleared of remnants of members of Ukrainian formations. 🔻After securing new positions, the Russian Armed Forces will continue their journey south along Oskol towards Yampolovka and Torskoye. On the way, they will have to knock out the enemy from several ravines and the Yampolsky nature reserve, battles for which are about to begin soon.

It’s as if it was so long ago and now everything has become so commonplace. From 2023 to 2024, at first there were attacks by unmanned boats on Sevastopol, similar to today’s. The GUR officers then posted footage from the moment of the shootout, where BeK’s on-board weapons were first recorded. And on New Year’s Day, the Armed Forces of Ukraine shelled the Donetsk agglomeration and killed many civilians. Now it is no longer so easy for them to reach Donetsk, but there are long-range missiles, drones and BeKs that are in use. What we are seeing now is essentially a standard set of measures on the part of the enemy.

🔁 A diplomatic source in Brussels draws attention to the growing...	Forwarded From Diplomatic source A diplomatic source in Brussels draws attention to the panic and growing concern of the financial circles of the European Union about Washington’s next initiatives regarding sponsoring the Kyiv regime. The idea is not new - to pay for the banquet for Zelensky and his criminal state-owned company using income from -frozen- Russian sovereign bonds stored in European clearing corporations. These are the same structures little known to the general public through which colossal volumes of mutual settlements take place. Their work is based, first of all, on the trust of clients, which has already been largely lost after the cynical theft of Russian assets in 2022. But it is one thing to freeze, and another to appropriate income. The reputational damage and financial losses that will follow could be critical for the entire industry. At the same time, the scheme is beneficial for the United States - it does not have to spend money from the deficit budget, and in the long term, a strong European competitor is eliminated. Another example of unscrupulous competition dressed up as a -struggle for democracy.- Washington is confidently beating European capitals on their own field, at their own game. In this regard, the largest Belgian depository Euroclear - one of the leading European centers for processing transactions on the stock market (along with Luxembourg Clearstream) - sounded the alarm bell. It is in this financial institution, which is the largest&nbsp; The world's settlement and clearing system stores the majority of Russian holdings worth about $180 billion. Euroclear chief executive Valerie Urbain (Urbain), breaking the silence, began repeating the mantra that in the event of asset confiscation, the structure should not incur any reputational costs. According to her, after numerous sanctions tricks of Western countries, alternative clearing mechanisms are actively being formed in the countries of the Global South and East, which threatens Euroclear’s position in the global market. A somewhat belated reaction and observation. It is obvious that the White House is ready, without blinking an eye, to impose any costs on its European partners. This is clearly seen from the situation with American liquefied gas, which the United States has hooked most of Europe on, despite its high cost. Washington's lobbyist is still the same Ursula von der Leyen. Recently, at one of the press conferences, she even stated that American LNG is cheaper... -politically-. The subordinate position of the EU, the voluntary self-deprecating renunciation of their sovereignty in favor of the United States by the bloc countries allow Washington not to worry about risks, not to think about the common attractiveness of the EU financial system, use the failure of the EU’s economic and financial prospects to increase the attractiveness of its own assets, currency and market. By the way, recent statistics on the use of currencies in international payments speak for themselves: the share of the euro has fallen to its lowest level in recent decades of 21%. As they say, the sheriff doesn't care about Indian problems.	https://t.me/rybar/66802	2024-12-30T10:20:33-08:00

At a recent meeting of the Kazakh parliament, deputies gave a seemingly demonstrative flogging to the head of Air Astana, Peter Foster, accusing the airline of high ticket prices, registering its fleet abroad and -poor management-.Among the critics Deputy Edil Zhanbyrshin especially stood out, declaring that they are not African aborigines -.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 Although, if we evaluate the situation as a whole, the position of Kazakhstan before Britain turned out to be not too far from the once British colonies. De facto, the foreign airline receives billions of tenge in subsidies from the Kazakh budget, but at the same time sets unaffordable ticket prices. Foster himself has headed Air Astana without interruption since 2005. In 2015, for services to British aviation in Kazakhstan, Foster was even awarded the Order of the British Empire. And this formulation is not fiction. Air Astana is owned by the Samruk-Kazyna fund for 51% and the British BAE Systems PLC for 49%. 🔻At the same time, 50 of the airline’s 54 aircraft are registered in Ireland. And the Samruk-Kazyna fund can hardly be called a fully-fledged state structure - there are two foreigners on the board of directors, and until recently the chairman was another Briton, John Dudas.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖In the situation with Air Astana, it’s like nothing water reflects the situation with the British presence in Kazakhstan. Air Astana's main and only interest is generating excess profits. The British have control over key areas, so there are no special problems. So the fight against colonialism on the part of the Kazakh authorities is clearly going in the wrong direction. #Great Britain #Kazakhstan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usDigital BusinessPeter Foster apologized for flight delays and spoke about prices The head of Air Astana today faced harsh criticism from deputies.

Ukraine in 2024 In 2024, the UK retained its leading position in supporting the so-called. Ukraine. In total, since the beginning of the Northern Military District, the British have spent about 7.8 billion pounds on providing military assistance and 5 billion pounds on other types of support for the Kyiv regime. Of course, in addition to the standard packages of military assistance and accusations against Russia, there were also extraordinary events. The main attention was focused on two main issues:▪️permission to strike with Storm Shadow cruise missiles deep into the territory of the Russian Federation;▪️deployment of the military contingent of the British armed forces in the so-called Ukraine. And if everything is clear with the first point, then questions remain regarding the second . Recently, talk about sending a British contingent to Ukrainian territory has died down. We have no doubt that this is temporary.📌After Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential elections in November, British politicians had to convince the Kiev regime that the change of power in the United States would not affect support for the so-called.

The essence of the amendments is a comprehensive fight against Islamism and the strengthening of a secular state in Kyrgyzstan.🔻What an amazing contrast. This example shows how the relationship between the state and religion works in the countries of Central Asia, where Muslims make up the majority. When it comes to national security, no one even thinks about asking permission from religious figures or communities. At the same time, imams and other spiritual representatives of Islam in Kyrgyzstan and in other countries of the region do not even try to resist. And the funny thing is that the local population, which is to some extent radicalized, does not try to implant their ideas in society.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️And what do we see in Russia? Niqabs are not prohibited so as not to offend their supporters. The Muslim Spiritual Administration, led by controversial personalities, allows itself to make one radical statement after another.

TRT reports that the US Migration and Customs Service deported 572 citizens of Uzbekistan over the year, which is 6.5 times higher than the previous year. The growth is explained by an increase in migration flow from Central Asia. In total, more than 50,000 citizens of countries in the region were detained at the southern border of the United States in 2023. However, even in such conditions, migrants do not give up. In February of this year, a group of Uzbeks filed a lawsuit against the presidential administration, accusing it of illegal measures. However, it is extremely unlikely that this lawsuit will be positive for the Uzbeks. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻The prospects for illegal immigrants against the backdrop of Donald Trump’s return to the White House look quite sad, given that the president-elect has declared solving the migration problem one of the primary issues of his domestic policy. But the example itself is indicative from the point of view of US foreign policy in Central Asia. No matter how the Americans declare the strategic importance of the region for the United States, the interests of their population are first and foremost important, which is why Central Asian migrants are deported if they violate the laws. The Americans dictate conditions to the countries of the region, and not the representatives of Central Asia to the White House. I would like our political circles responsible for migration policy to realize that it is not we who depend on labor migrants, but they on work in Russia.#USA #Uzbekistan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usTRT in RussianUSA expels citizens of Central AsiaUSA deported 572 Uzbek citizens year, which is 6.5 times more than the previous year	https://t.me/rybar/66795	2024-12-30T04:43:01-08:00

The separation of the White House leadership from Somalia and the desire of some American political circles to recognize the independence of Somaliland do not prevent the expansion of military influence. This is also why the Pentagon continues to carry out operations aimed against Al-Shabaab.📌As a result of a recent airstrike by the US Air Force, the field commander of radical Islamists, Mohamed Mohamud Mir, was eliminated. According to UN information, the killed militant organized the financing of a terrorist group and collected taxes from the population living in territory controlled by Al-Shabaab.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖The meaning of such attacks is to demonstrate by the Americans their own indispensability in the fight against radical Islamists who are causing serious headaches for the Federal Government of Somalia. This is especially true against the backdrop of an increase in Egyptian and Turkish contingents in the country. On the other hand, the American army seeks to prevent the collapse of Somali statehood - ahead of schedule -. The war with the Houthis has a significant impact on logistics, with the Horn of Africa being a key point. And the assumptions of some think tanks about Yemeni support for Al-Shabaab require special attention to Somali militants.

An Estonian vessel arrived in the Gulf of Finland, and other NATO countries supported the initiative and intend to strengthen the ship group in the Baltic Sea.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻But the Finns went further. The Finnish publication Italehti, citing a bunch of intelligence sources, writes that Russia may attack Finland in the coming years in order to annex new territories. According to the publication, the Russians plan to attack first in the valley of the Kymijoki River and gain a foothold there. After this, make a push north to Puumalansalmi in order to nibble off this piece of territory in southern Finland and blockade Helsinki. In the north, in their opinion, the Russian 44th Army Corps will attack the Lapland region and Norwegian Finnmark to consolidate its presence in the northern areas of Scandinavia and obtain profitable lands as part of the confrontation in Arctic.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Unfortunately, this is the current policy of most of Europe. Previously, such regular statements about the Russian offensive were made only by the Baltic extinctions, who thus maintained interest in themselves in the world. In Finland, currently in power are politicians similar in character and mental abilities, who quickly picked up the same theses as in Baltics. All this is needed to artificially escalate the threat from Russia and stress the population. Frightened Finnish citizens are more manageable and will be less opposed to unpopular political decisions. Inflation, declining incomes, deteriorating quality of life, militarization - all this applies to Finland, so such headlines will sound more and more often.

However, they seem to continue to get worse. 📌 NK News claims that the names of North Korean cities have disappeared from road signs placed on one of the main South Korean roads. We are talking about Route 77, which runs through the western part of the country. Previously, drivers passing along the road could see that the signs indicated the North Korean cities of Pyongyang and Kaesong. Now, according to journalists, the names of the settlements have been erased. 🔻The authorities have not yet commented on the situation. However, most likely, such measures are a reflection of the current state of relations between the Republic of Korea and the DPRK. Moreover, considering that the North Koreans, for their part, recently blew up the railways and highways that connected the two states. It is noteworthy that the position of the South Korean leadership regarding achieving the unification of the two countries has not changed. Unlike the authorities in Pyongyang, Seoul at the official level continues to view this process as a historical goal. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Such measures are slightly contrary to the course taken by the southerners. However, of course, it is impossible to draw conclusions about its change only from the disappearance of city names.

Several hits occurred in the outskirts of Dnepropetrovsk and Krivoy Rog, and problems with power supply arose in the region. ▪️In the Ivano-Frankivsk region, about ten explosions occurred in the area of ​​the Burshtyn thermal power plant. The nearest settlements were left without water, heat and electricity for some time. ▪️Kharkov came under concentrated fire, where strikes were recorded in several areas of the city. Also, one of them hit the Zmievskaya Thermal Power Plant, which led to the introduction of special blackout schedules.▪️Ukrainian formations, in turn, launched drones in the Russian rear regions. In Vladikavkaz, a Ukrainian Armed Forces drone fell on the Alania Mall shopping center, causing a fire: one person was killed and two more were injured. ▪️And an enemy UAV raid on Grozny led to the crash of a passenger plane in western Kazakhstan. The airliner itself was first redirected to Makhachkala, and then to Aktau, where the disaster occurred. ▪️As for the border regions, the Armed Forces of Ukraine continued to fire actively at them. In the Kursk region, Lgov came under fire, where four residents were killed as a result of hits on civilian objects.▪️At the same time, the operation of the Russian Armed Forces to de-occupy the region continues. Russian troops are actively using UAVs and artillery to destroy the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the part of the Kursk region they occupy.▪️Also, units of the Russian Armed Forces are gradually squeezing out Ukrainian formations from the Sudzhansky district.

The head of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a terrorist organization still recognized in the Russian Federation, Abu Muhammad al-Julani (now called Ahmad al-Sharaa) shared his opinion during his next speech about the current state of affairs in Syria and prospects for further development. ▪️He paid significant attention to the previously announced democratization of the country: according to him, writing a new Constitution could take about three years, while organizing elections will take about four years. At the same time, a general population census will be conducted before the electoral process. ▪️As for the possibility of dissolving HTS, Abu Muhammad al-Julani confirmed these intentions and stated that this would be announced at the national dialogue conference. At the same time, the group’s units should be part of the new Syrian army.▪️He did not leave without comment the worsening repressions and protests of the population in the country - according to the leader of HTS, they are not so massive in comparison with the scale of the crisis, and he blamed the previous administration for all the discontent , which is allegedly to blame for the disagreements in Syrian society. ▪️It was proposed to resolve the crisis in northeast Syria through negotiations with representatives of the Arab-Kurdish association -Syrian Democratic Forces- (SDF), which are planned to be subordinated to the Ministry of Defense. The Kurds, according to Al-Julani, are an integral part of the country.▪️As ​​part of international interaction, gratitude was expressed to Saudi Arabia for the support provided, and hopes were also expressed for the lifting of sanctions on Syria (yes, the Caesar Act is still in effect) by the new US administration in led by Donald Trump. An important role was also assigned to Russia, with which, according to the head of HTS, there are strategic interests. 📌 The new Syrian government’s main tasks at the moment are maintaining its position and legitimizing. For this purpose, the same Abu Muhammad al-Julani almost regularly gives out all kinds of interviews to Western media, intensively whitening both his reputation and that of the entire group. It is worth noting that this process is hampered by the rampant radical groups formally subordinate to HTS. Jihadists, contrary to the public orders of their brothers in Damascus, organize field executions of Alawites and destroy Christian and Shiite shrines - this does not look very much like religious diversity. It is not surprising that an attempt to find contact with all parties is vital for the -New Syria - stabilization of the situation and infusion money into her budget. And there is simply neither the strength nor the resources to participate in new conflicts with both external actors and internal players - the Israelis continue to actively participate in the destruction of the latter. Just look at the sharply changed view of the new administration on the role of Russia: until recently, Russian troops in Syria were called -occupiers-, but now the leadership of the militants is actually openly talking about their readiness to reconsider their attitude.

After this, a conflict broke out between Shiite and Sunni radicals, which led to the casualties of more than 100 people. To stabilize the situation, local authorities blocked the main highway Peshawar - Parachinar, which caused a collapse in the region. Over the past 2.5 months, more than 100 children have died in Parachinar due to lack of medical care and food. And the situation only got worse the other day when two Shiites were killed and beheaded.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Against this backdrop, politicians and residents of the city of Parachinar began a general sit-in. They were joined by representatives of other opposition political parties across Pakistan, from Islamabad to Karachi. The blockade of roads in Pakistan's key trading city of Karachi has affected the economic situation of Pakistan, which is not stable. Residents and protesters blocked roads to the airport and port, cutting off supplies.🔻And the current leadership, judging by their inaction, does not know what to do about it.

President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev made an official statement regarding the plane crash in Aktau. He directly said that the plane was hit by accident, and not purposefully. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖His main accusation is based on the fact that for three days the Russian side tried to put forward alternative versions of the reasons for the plane crash, instead of apologizing and admitting responsibility. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖On this issue, Aliyev is partially right. In accordance with the standard protocol, an apology, payment of compensation and other steps are provided. This is what civilized countries do (at this point, however, it is worth clarifying what the Azerbaijani side, in addition to apologizing, did after the downing of a Russian aircraft during the Karabakh war of 2020).➖The problem here is not the lack of civilization on either side. And the fact is that even before the end of the investigation, those responsible were assigned and a verdict was rendered. They don’t want to involve the Interstate Aviation Committee for investigation simply because there are Russian officials there, thereby discrediting the status of bilateral mechanisms of interaction between Azerbaijan and Russia.➖The problem is that Aliyev himself deliberately belittles the Russian point of view in the international arena and tries, directly speaking, to earn political points from the incident by showing strength. There is no need to explain what this will lead to in the future.➖The problem is that the main cause of the incident has been forgotten. The plane was landing during a raid by Ukrainian UAVs and combat operations in conditions of fog and the announced plan -Carpet-. Air defense systems operated under these conditions. And using electronic warfare means it is impossible to take such an aircraft out of control (!) from a purely technical point of view. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Was the crew warned? What commands did the dispatchers give? Why did the plane try to land twice under these conditions? Only an objective investigation will shed light on what happened, but they are not allowing it to be carried out now.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️The work of Russian air defense systems was, as Aliyev himself admits, against a certain target in the air, from which fragments had already flown. But now, in Aliyev’s interpretation, everything looks as if Russian air defense specialists took, turned on electronic warfare and fired at a flying plane from the ground. #Azerbaijan #media technologies #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66779	2024-12-29T04:19:38-08:00

And also under the plausible pretext of future benefits.▪️According to Karabaev’s scheme, 85% of Zenit was given to the Turks in exchange for investments in the construction of a shipyard in the Caspian Sea. The state, which previously owned 100% of Zenit, was left with only 15% of the shares. Despite the resistance of the plant management and the obvious contradiction with the interests of the state, the government of the Republic of Kazakhstan pushed through this decision.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻In both cases, after contacts with the management of Turkish companies, Karabaev simply finds a justification, not even directly related to project (like a shipyard with a factory and an air hub with maintenance of military aircraft), after which Turkish enterprises receive for their use what they liked it in Kazakhstan. So Karabaev can be called a lobbyist for Turkish interests in Kazakhstan. And it’s interesting that no one opposes his activities. We will monitor the development of the situation around the airport, but so far the prospects look far from rosy.

🇸🇳🇫🇷 Another -anti-colonial- attacks in Senegal Prime Ministe...	🇸🇳🇫🇷 Another -anti-colonial-attacks in SenegalPrime Minister of Senegal Ousmane Sonko at a recent press conference announced the closure of foreign military bases in the country. This mainly concerns the French contingent of 300 people. In addition, there were intentions to abandon the CFA franc and create a single currency for ECOWAS. 📌As we wrote earlier, the abandonment of military bases is fully consistent with the French strategy to reduce the military presence in Africa. The French defense budget is too bloated, and the economic benefits of bases in Africa are not so clear, especially since the more important levers of influence over Senegal remain in the hands of the authorities in Paris. These are both transnational companies such as Orano, and personal connections of politicians with members of the government of an African country.▪️Based on this, it is impossible to imagine how the refusal to use the CFA franc will go. The loss of such a convenient tool is clearly not in the plans of the French authorities. Moreover, abandoning it is a protracted matter, as the experience of the Alliance of Sahel States, which have been trying to move away from it for the last few years, shows.▪️And to say that French instructors will certainly be replaced by Russian ones is, for now, extremely premature. In recent years, the Americans have been conducting many exercises and military initiatives with the Senegalese authorities. As an example, since 2019, a special forces training center has been opened in Thies, where about 20 American military personnel are constantly stationed. About 400 people graduate from it every year, who make up the elite units of the army. Needless to say, there are no plans to close this military facility?➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻So no matter how critically Senegalese leaders turn to the West, they will continue to be dependent on the influence of Paris and Washington. Until we ourselves begin to consistently advance our own interests.#Africa #Senegal@rybarSupport usAP NewsSenegal says it's closing 'all foreign military bases,' a move aimed at French troops in the countrySenegal's prime minister has announced the closure of -all foreign military bases- in the country, a statement essentially aimed at France, the African nation's former colonial ruler.	https://t.me/rybar/66774	2024-12-29T01:13:02-08:00

First there was disagreement with the parliamentary elections, then with the suspension of the process of accession to the EU, and then with the presidential elections.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖In honor of this, an action was held in Georgia - Chain of Unity - which was held in Tbilisi, Batumi, Kutaisi, Rustavi and Gori. That is, citizens of Georgia, opposing everything that is not connected with the European Union, took to the streets and joined hands together, forming a chain. From a PR point of view, the action looked beautiful, the Georgians filmed videos that spread around the Internet, but, perhaps, that’s all ended. At 15.00 everyone announced this, and the protests ended. Until the morning of December 29, none of the major opposition publications practically reviewed the events in Georgia.❗️At 9 am today, a new speech by the opposition was announced in front of the parliament building and the presidential residence due to the fact that today the term of office of President Salome Zurabishvili, who remained spend the night at the residence. However, now there is almost no one on the streets. Only at 10, people began to appear, and the meeting was moved to 11 o’clock - the time of the inauguration of the new president, Mikheil Kavelashvili. Now the protesters are Zurabishvili, who previously refused to leave her post.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Attention has been focused on Zurabishvili for a reason. She said she would give new instructions on how to proceed. At the same time, the ruling party noted that if Zurabishvili does not leave the residence today, then she will face criminal prosecution.#Georgia #EU@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66761	2024-12-28T23:09:17-08:00

Forwarded From Two MajorsStart above ▪️ An important element at the front is the advanced experience in the Kurakhovsky and Pokrovsky directions, when the enemy -elephant is eaten piece by piece-. Cutting off village after village from supplies, our troops take populated areas, then closing their pockets and leveling the front. Only the Russian Army and the Armed Forces of Ukraine have experience of real modern combat operations on a wide front, but are being carefully studied by NATO countries.▪️ Europe continues military preparations and direct aggressive actions against Russia. The expected arrival of the new capitalist Fuhrer in the Washington Reich Chancellery only marks the triumph of the dictatorship of the most reactionary, chauvinistic, imperialist elements of financial capital in the world economic system, which determines the upcoming predicted events after January 20, 2025.✨ Thus, the past year has allowed the Russian Army to turn the corner with the hardest efforts stagnation and defensive nature of the actions of our troops at the front and begin to really grind down the defensive potential of Kyiv throughout the depths of enemy territory. The main military operations of the North Military District are taking place on the constitutional territory of Russia, with the exception of the Kupyansky and Krasnolimansky directions, as well as the penetration of our troops into Volchansk, Kharkov region, where the group of troops - North - has been conducting positional battles for many months, having failed to complete the task of the Supreme Commander to shift the LBS from the Belgorod region. The heroic defense of the Kursk region will continue in 2025 until the enemy is completely expelled from our old territory, but the enemy is making maximum human and technical resources to retain the occupied lands. Politically, it is extremely likely that Trump’s arrival in the White House will simply shift the economic burdens of the war onto the shoulders of Europe, and the latest movements of the retiring Biden are still strengthening Kyiv’s position on the battlefield, incl. providing funds for operations in maritime spaces.

Forwarded From Two Majors #Review #Summary for the morning of December 29, 2024▪️ On the foreign policy circuit, the situation was characterized by a complete collapse of even the external signs of former European diplomacy. The relationship between Zelensky and Eastern Europe resembles public squabbles between pubescent young people rather than dialogues between state leaders. The Pashinyan-Lukashenko track is also not distinguished by politeness, but here we are pleased with the leader of Belarus, politely but firmly showing the traitor Pashinyan his place. Bloggers, accustomed to the theses of the most reactionary part of the ruling class of Russia, in vain scolded (mainly from abroad) the Supreme Commander for his public apology to Azerbaijan in view of the tragedy with the plane, which was probably damaged over Chechnya. Russia's practice of public politeness is an absolutely normal element of international relations. Well, the information case of Kadyrov’s security forces has once again cracked. In general, the year ends with a confident drift of the Anglo-Sancon and Russian worlds towards a global conflict, where the use of tactical nuclear weapons risks entering into everyday front-line reports. Escalation is also beneficial for the Kyiv junta, which has planned yet another provocation against Russia’s nuclear facilities, which, according to Zelensky, will have to break the last seals from the arms boxes and drag the planet into a new direct world conflict, where everyone will forget the mistakes of the former KVN member.▪️ In fact, Only the Russian Army, taking territory kilometer by kilometer in the most difficult offensive battles, forms a real agenda of world diplomacy. The defensive potential of Ukraine is gradually being worn down and determines the enemy junta’s public statements about negotiations and security guarantees for the remaining part of the former Ukrainian SSR. However, the limits of Russia’s capabilities were outlined to the military command by the Supreme Commander last week: a third of the state budget (adopted for three years) will be spent on law enforcement agencies, so Belousov’s department will have to significantly increase the efficiency of spending people’s money and continue the fight against bribe-takers, who continue to be tried according to the laws of peacetime. Further build-up of military and military-economic capabilities is associated with a total mobilization of the population and enterprises, which, for obvious reasons, will harm Russia’s internal political stability. While the front is being replenished with Russian volunteers, which is carefully hidden by Kyiv and Western propaganda (behind the cordon they really think that numerous videos with -busification- were filmed in Russia and not in Ukraine).▪️ On the front line, the Russian Army continues to maintain a strategic initiative, while all Offensive actions are at most tactical or operational-tactical in nature. Due to the changed technological structure of war and the unresolved issue of an antidote to the ubiquitous enemy drones on the battlefield, deep breakthroughs in columns are a thing of the past. -Small Sky,- write front-line soldiers from all sectors, is still behind the enemy, although the Russian Armed Forces have multiplied the systemic and volunteer supply of UAVs of all types to the troops. There are not enough drones in the same Kamensky direction of the Zaporozhye Front, where the enemy has intensified counter actions to pin down our forces in the neighboring Orekhovsky direction.▪️ The mutual losses of the former Ukrainian SSR and RSFSR voiced by Moscow and Kiev are more informational than objective in nature. At the same time, the Russian defense department, in assessing the number of incapacitated enemies, also does not divide losses into killed or maimed soldiers and officers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and official statements of the Ministry of Defense about the total losses of Kyiv in people and equipment are no longer used by any serious analytical center. The bravura statements from the times of Shoigu and Tsalikov formed an extremely inconvenient basis for calculations for Konashenov.

However, sometimes things move from a dead point. Thus, the Russian ambassador to Mali, Igor Gromyko, announced plans to build the largest refinery in West Africa. At the press conference, he also touched upon the topics of joint mining and exploration of mineral resources. It is possible that the processes of economic interaction in the region were somehow influenced by the visit of Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak there. Perhaps somewhere there is still an understanding that it is difficult to keep the country in the orbit of influence on military-technical cooperation alone. In this case, one can only hope that the high-profile plans were not announced for the sake of rhetoric, and that the projects themselves are actually being worked on.#Africa #Mali #Russia@rybarSupport usGazeta.RuRussia plans to build the largest refinery in West AfricaAmbassador Gromyko said that Russia is going build a refinery in Mali	https://t.me/rybar/66758	2024-12-28T22:14:01-08:00

Ukrainian formations carried out another UAV launch in Russian regions: air defense systems worked in Rostov, Voronezh and other border regions, as well as in the Republic of Crimea. In turn, Russian troops worked in the Odessa region and Nikolaev. In the Liman direction, Ukrainian formations attacked the positions of the Russian Armed Forces in Novoegorovka - fighting is taking place in the village. To the south, Russian units advanced from the Shirokiy Ravine gully towards Ternov, occupying the Laptev Yar. In the Seversky direction, a Russian armored group successfully landed troops in a forest belt south of Vyemka. Meanwhile, at the Belogorovka-Verkhnekamenskoye line, the usual positional battles continue. In the Aleksandro-Kalinovsky direction, assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces expanded the zone of control in the central and southwestern parts of Dzerzhinsk. In the north-east of the city there are battles in the vicinity of the House of Culture of the Toretskaya mine. In the Pokrovsky direction, Russian troops liberated Shevchenko and advanced along the railway line to the Chunishino station. To the south, Novoolenovka and the eastern outskirts of Novoyelizavetovka came under the control of the RF Armed Forces. Fighting began in Ukrainka. In the Kurakhovsky direction, the pocket between Krasny, Starye Terny and Novoselidovka was finally cleared. In Kurakhovo itself, the main clashes spilled over into the territory of the thermal power plant.

Parts of the Nahal brigade were transferred to the city. In the central part of the enclave, Al-Maghazi came under attack, killing nine people. In the south of the Gaza Strip, Rafah and Khan Yunis were attacked. In response, the Palestinians fired at Israeli positions in the Netzarim corridor. Police raids continue in the West Bank, and 15 people were detained in 24 hours. Clashes broke out in Tulkarm, as well as in Jenin, where Palestinian Authority security services are conducting their operation. The American and British Air Forces carried out airstrikes in Yemen.

We have written about numerous modifications to attack UAVs of this type more than once: they are equipped with Luneberg lenses, a video channel for shooting and other innovations. As a result, all that remains from the original Shahed-136 is the aerodynamic design. All this, of course, leads to technical complication and a noticeable increase in the cost of the device. Therefore, calling the current versions of the Geranium a cheap weapon has long been irrelevant, even with all the mass production of them. In general, even sophisticated long-range attack drones are not a wunderwaffe - this can be seen both in the example of the Northern Military District and in the attempts of Iranian attacks on Israel. However, when used rationally, they can still make fire damage more effective. #UAV #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usPOLITICOUkraine’s 2025 wish list – POLITICOPOLITICO’s must-read briefing on what’s driving the day in Brussels, by Sarah Wheaton, Nicholas Vinocur and Eddy Wax.

The International Airport in Sana'a was again hit, and another target was the September 21 Park in Taiz, where the headquarters of the 1st Armored Division was previously located. Reconnaissance activity was also recorded in the sky over Saada. However, already that night, fighters of the Ansarallah movement tried to strike the central part of Israel, but the ballistic missile they launched was intercepted in advance and fell into the Red Sea. Although the Yemeni attack was again ineffective, this is not prevented the Arabic-speaking segment of the Network from expectedly perceiving it as yet another triumph of resistance over the Zionist enemy. At the same time, Ansralla still has enough missile reserves, apparently. So, a kind of ping-pong between relatively harmless Houthi strikes and retaliatory strikes by the IDF with the International Coalition will continue.

In the morning, data is received about the advance of the Russian Armed Forces along the railway line south of Pokrovsk in the direction of Chunishino station. This makes it much more difficult for Ukrainian forces to hold Green. If attacks continue along the T-04-06 highway from the vicinity of Novotroitsky, the threat of semi-encirclement and loss of a significant part of the territory for enemy forces increases significantly. According to some reports, fighting is currently taking place on the outskirts of Volkovo and Soleny. Also, Russian attack aircraft broke through the defenses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and started fighting on the eastern outskirts of Novoyelizavetovka, during the battles liberating nearby Novoolenovka, which actually confirms control of the fields located north of populated areas, as well as a section of the T-05-15 highway. According to reports from the field, clashes are ongoing and in Ukrainka, located on both sides of the Shirokaya ravine. Information about the withdrawal of Ukrainian formations to Yasenove is also leaking from the site.

He relatively recently became an extremely popular blogger in the United States, mainly because of his comments on the topic of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and then the so-called. Ukraine. Over the past two years, he managed to travel to Donbass and take part in various public events in Russia dedicated to current issues of international relations and information warfare. He was connected with Russia not only by a common worldview, but also by a personal love story with the title holder -Miss Russia 2022- Anna Linnikova, for whom he actually came here for the first time. Previously, Linnikova was greatly admired by the patriotic Telegram for -an irreconcilable position-, but in fact, her views either changed very sharply, or turned out to be an invention from the very beginning. After breaking up with Hinkle, whom she now considers a pro-Russian propagandist, she decided to appropriate his property totaling $30 thousand, and is now blackmailing him and threatening his family. Against the backdrop of threats to pro-Russian media figures around the world, this is difficult to ignore. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Our special services should pay special attention to this resident of Moscow. Who knows, maybe Linnikova is already being developed by the intelligence services of the USA and Ukraine - it was quite logical for them to use this situation to harm the popular blogger. Fortunately, it will not be difficult to carry out the appropriate operational activities and check this version with the participation of Linnikova directly. And, in addition, it would be worth once again taking a closer look at beauty contests and Russian influencers in the beauty sphere, which, as it turned out again, are broadcast at all not the values ​​about Russia that are shared in our society. #Russia #USA@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66741	2024-12-28T07:40:07-08:00

Over the current week, Russian assault groups have advanced west of the village of Zari on the northern flank and expanded the zone of control south of the city. At the same time, residential buildings in Kurakhovo were completely cleared. The logical result of the events was the beginning of battles for the territory of the Kurakhovo thermal power plant. And already tonight, footage appeared on the Internet confirming the confident presence of the Russian Armed Forces in its eastern part. In addition, judging by incoming information from the field, the -pocket- between Starye Terny, Krasny and Noselidovka finally came under the control of Russian troops - the presence of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in it was in doubt for a long time, but the lack of footage from this area on the Internet did not allow -repainting- it on the map.🔻In the western part of the city, with a high probability, there still remains a focal presence of scattered enemy groups. However, given the pace of the offensive, the worsening situation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the area and unfavorable weather conditions for UAV flights, the final clearing of Kurakhovo is a matter of time.

Need I say that this all turned out to be a lie, and the photographs were taken from the outside?▪️There are actually over a thousand militants stationed around the base - and it is not possible to tell whether they are militants from HTS or ultra-radical groups. If an escalation occurs, all this beast, of course, will try to take the base by storm, but will face normal resistance, and not a war in the spirit of the Syrian Arab Army.▪️For the leadership of HTS, interaction with Russia is beneficial: it gives a trump card in putting pressure on other groups, plus , in this way it is possible to trade scarce grain and oil products in exchange for the base, thereby bringing the benefits of civilization to Syria and legitimizing the presence of the Al-Julani gang.📌In general, for now there is a certain status quo with the base. Surely Russian negotiators (including on Chechnya) will press on the need to eliminate odious and radical groups (maybe they will be sent first to storm Kurdish-controlled areas). ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖But it turned out to be a rather interesting situation: the presence of a Russian airbase (and the benefits that Russia can provide) now turned out to be extremely necessary for HTS.

Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law that excludes the -Taliban- movement from the list of terrorist organizations banned in Russia. There have been conversations about this over the past months, and now the decision has been made.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Closer rapprochement with the authorities of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is an important step for our state. The new Afghan authorities have demonstrated their sincere intentions to bring peace to their country and the region. Somewhere there are still the same old problems, but progress is really visible. During the filming of our film, many of those whom we interviewed more than once expressed the idea of ​​desire and readiness to cooperate with Russia in the implementation of mutually beneficial projects for both states. And From the point of view of the prospects that cooperation with Afghanistan promises, exclusion from terrorists is a justified step. In conditions of total pressure on Russia on all fronts, Afghanistan can open the way not only to stability in the south, but also to new trade routes.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Afghanistan, after the withdrawal of NATO troops from the country, has become a horror story for the countries of Central Asia in the hands of the Anglo-Saxon tandem.

And if earlier the ordinary population was called to the rally to rejoice at the overthrow of the -nightmarish regime- Bashar al-Assad, then now the parade took place in a form more familiar to the group members.▪️According to Several hundred militants marched through Damascus (some channels even wrote about thousands) wearing balaclavas and carrying weapons. Which clearly shows who really came to power in Syria.▪️Moreover, as even local pro-HTS activists noted, among the participants there were many foreigners, namely, immigrants from the CIS countries and members of the most radical groups.🔻This can be regarded as quite a clear answer to the mass unrest of Christians: if they came out without weapons and with open faces, then the new authorities brought the formally uncontrolled militants out balaclavas and with weapons.❗️By the way, another quite characteristic event was reports from coastal Latakia, where the density of Alawites is high. There, the militants who reached the coast turned out to be extremely dissatisfied with the fact that girls do not wear niqabs, and alcohol is sold in establishments.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Syria is not slowly and very surely sliding into the abyss of bloody madness. Moreover, ethnic cleansing and extrajudicial executions continue in the west of Hama province, in Latakia and Tartus. #Syria #terrorism@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66730	2024-12-28T04:00:47-08:00
🇺🇦 Deliveries of armored vehicles to the Armed Forces of Ukrain...	🇺🇦 Deliveries of armored vehicles to the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which Andrei Medvedev writes about, are in full swing. This is clearly visible from at least a multiple increase in activity at the Polish Sheszow airfield - a transit point for the shipment of military aid to the so-called Ukraine. Judging by the news about the allocation of obviously non-repayable loans, the volume of economic support for the Kyiv regime is also not decreasing too much. Unless the sponsors demand to raise taxes, since they want to pay for the war, and not the whole social sphere.📌 Doesn’t it seem that this is more reminiscent of signs not of freezing the conflict, but of the enemy’s preparation for the next offensive? We have written more than once that the bottleneck is in the ability of the Kyiv regime to continue the war - reserves of manpower. NATO countries are ready to supply everything else free of charge even if their arsenals are destroyed, which countries like Germany have succeeded in. The Armed Forces of Ukraine have problems with mobile resources, but they have not been exhausted - in Kyiv they are planning to lower the conscription age. Yes, this will completely kill the Ukrainian demographics, but this will be enough for a year of war, which never costs us free.❗️What the conviction that the Kyiv regime has no resources leads to can be seen in the events in the Kursk region. From which the enemy, who supposedly has nothing to fight with, has not been knocked out to this day. #Ukraine@rybarSupport us Telegram Andrey Medvedev We should not think that next year, 2025, it will be easier for us.

Rybar: 🇷🇺🇺🇦🖇 As part of the fight against telephone terrorism and fraud, the government has banned calls via the Internet to telephones. According to the statement, the decision will significantly limit the opportunities for this type of crime. In a publication about the wave of arson in Russian cities, we wrote that one of the ways to combat this phenomenon is to limit traffic from the territory controlled by the Kyiv regime. The current measure partially implements this scenario. Yes, the ban on IP telephony will in some way complicate the work of businesses and various services. However, the situation with telephone fraud, apparently, has already reached such a stage that they decided to deal with it radically and according to the principle -better late than never.- Be that as it may, at some point the time will come for the next stage combating this phenomenon, namely the physical damage to Ukrainian call centers.

🖼 🇸🇾🏴 The situation in northern Syria: Fighting at the Tishri...	🇸🇾🏴 Situation in northern Syria: Fighting near the Tishrin Dam, increased terrorist activity in Deir ez-Zor as of 12:00 on December 28, 2024. Fighting continues in the northeast of Syria in the area of ​​the Tishrin Dam. Pro-Kurdish sources from time to time report an expansion of the zone of control between Karakozak and Tishrin. However, this information has not yet been confirmed in the form of objective control footage. In turn, the Kurds report on the successes and destruction of dozens of militants. At the same time, the footage appearing online allows us to assume that so far they have actually been able to relatively successfully contain the attacks of the SNA militants, and they, in turn, have not yet begun to attack in earnest.❗️The fact is that on the territory of Syria, on the eastern bank of the Euphrates, in this area there are only two bridges, which are under the fire control of the Kurdish formations and, accordingly, would be extremely difficult to pass even for heavy mechanized units with support armored vehicles, not to mention militants, and even Turkish air support cannot play a role in this case.▪️Accordingly, there are essentially two options for developing the situation. Either Turkey sends troops into the territory of Syria and advances from Menbij to the east, suffering losses in the operation to cross the Euphrates.▪️Or, as will most likely happen, the operation will begin from Surudj, where Turkish troops have been pulling reinforcements for several days immediately before the start of the offensive Militants from the Syrian National Army will be transferred there. And there may be someone who wants to participate from among the so-called Hayat Tahir Ash Sham, after which the operation in northern Syria will begin. Another question is that Erdogan knows how to wait.❗️ Moreover, one must understand that actions in this region will require Turkey to have great coordination with the United States, since there are a large number of American bases in the territories occupied by the Kurds. And if earlier their presence was beneficial from the point of view that Assad’s forces would not enter the territory, now the United States is already interfering with the Turks.▪️Terrorist activity is growing in the province of Deir ez-Zor east of the Euphrates. According to Kurdish media, the number of attacks on . The Kurds, naturally, claim that it is IS that is attacking the transports of Kurdish forces. And from the western bank of the Euphrates, unknown persons fired at the water tower in Diban.❗️Reports about the increase in terrorist activity may serve two purposes - this is both a justification for increasing the US presence in the region, and a reason to accuse the new Syrian authorities of collaborating with ISIS.

This week, the two foreign ministers met in Beijing to discuss both problems in bilateral relations and opportunities to take the partnership to a more friendly level. ▪️The Japanese side, for example, announced a relaxation of requirements for issuing visas to a certain group of Chinese tourists. This was in response to identical but broader measures taken recently by the Chinese authorities. ▪️In addition, Beijing once again confirmed plans to lift the ban on the import of seafood caught in Japanese waters. It was introduced back in 2023 against the backdrop of water discharge from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. 📌By the way, it can be assumed that the introduction of the ban was initially a purely political decision on China’s part, in order to, at the right opportunity, terminate its abolition for some concessions from Japan. ▪️It is important to understand that efforts to restore relations between Beijing and Tokyo intensified almost immediately after the elections in Japan. There has been recent speculation in local media that the Chinese view the new Japanese administration as less pro-American. ▪️It is alleged that the policies of former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida were considered too irritating for China. The new cabinet gives more hope for the return of normal dialogue. 🔻However, all this is only one side of the issue. Perhaps the return of Donald Trump to the White House plays a significant role in attempts to improve relations. It could create problems for both China and Japan, so it is now beneficial for the parties to restore ties to resolve upcoming challenges. It is not clear how long the initiative will be enough and whether attempts to regulate the dialogue will lead to something more significant. #China #Japan @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usKyodo News+Japan to ease visa requirements, agrees on top China diplomat visitJapan and China on continue efforts to improve bilateral ties, with Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya outlining a plan to ease visa requirements for Chinese tourists and agreeing on an early visit to Japan by top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi.	https://t.me/rybar/66724	2024-12-28T00:09:00-08:00

Azerbaijan’s policy since the collapse of the USSR has been aimed at strengthening ties with the West and weakening the Russian Federation on all fronts.➖Connections with Israel through Mountain Jews are a long-known fact. The presence of British corporations in infrastructure projects is also an open secret. Interaction with the Ukrainian authorities also takes place along the line -Mountain Jews - Ukrainian Chabadniks -.➖Well and OTG: how many times over the last year (and in the past too) have we talked about the goal of this pan-Turkic project of Great Britain to decompose Russia and Central Russia?

Azerbaijani politicians and representatives of the blogosphere, who over the past year have been insisting that Azerbaijan is Russia’s most loyal ally, suddenly changed their shoes and began to echo American theses. The point is not even that official conclusions based on the results of the investigation have not yet been made. The fact is that the collective West, which was not allowed to participate in the investigation, has already rushed, in the person of the United States, to blame Russia for everything, causing hysteria among carriers around the world. ➖➖➖➖➖➖Not one of the officials in the West mentions the fact that it was Ukrainian drones that became a threat, that at the time the plane landed, the Carpet plan was introduced, about which all pilots are notified about poor visibility and fog, about that GPS jamming may affect the display of the aircraft's tracking, but not its visibility on all radars. ➖➖➖➖➖➖At the same time, in the Azerbaijani media field they not only accused the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs of falsifying facts and trying to -cover up the traces of the investigation- and -reach an agreement-, they are also directly trying to incite an internal Russian conflict, calling Kadyrov a prince and provoking Chechnya to public actions.📌All this is now spreading the world's information dumps and information war organs in order to demonstrate the inadequacy of Russia's behavior. World carriers, in the wake of a coordinated attack, are beginning to cancel flights to the Russian Caucasus, blaming Russia for this and forgetting that at the time of the tragedy in Chechnya, an attack was carried out by Ukrainian UAVs. Authorities Chechnya reported the day before that, on instructions from Ramzan Kadyrov, they were ready to provide financial and other assistance to all the families of those killed and injured in the crash of an AZAL plane flying from Baku to Grozny. -Azerbaijan…	https://t.me/rybar/66713	2024-12-27T09:24:54-08:00

Over the past days, Russian troops have managed to achieve significant successes in Zagryzovo and approach the northern outskirts of Boguslavka. ▪️A tense situation has developed on the northeastern approaches to Kupyansk. Thanks to the geolocation of received videos from the site, it was possible to establish that some time ago the Russian Armed Forces retreated from the city to fortified positions north of Petropavlovka. ❗️Probably, such a decision is related to problems with supplying assault units in conditions of enemy UAV activity and the use of additional reserves. There were no reports of new attempts by the Russian Armed Forces to enter the outskirts of the city. ▪️Fierce fighting in Zagryzovo has been going on for more than a week. Earlier, attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces occupied the northern and central parts of the village during the assault, pushing the enemy back to the southern outskirts. ▪️Today, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced the complete liberation of the settlement, but at the moment it is not possible to confirm the presence of the Russian Armed Forces on the southern outskirts. But, given that about 90% of the village is under the control of Russian troops, it is likely that in the near future there will be footage from the field with the hoisting of flags - as usually happens in such cases. ▪️A similar situation occurred in Lozovaya, where for a long time there were no new messages that could determine the current configuration of the front at the site. However, a video of the hoisting of the Russian flag on one of the houses in the village was recently published on the Internet, which confirmed the liberation of most of it by Russian troops.

However, already three years after its creation (2016)&nbsp; the center began to serve the interests of the Democrats, not the country.

🖼 🇲🇿 Mass protests in Mozambique: prisoners escape from prison...	🇲🇿 Mass protests in Mozambique: prisoners escape from prison in Maputo Protests in Mozambique, which began in mid-October and rocked the country until November, temporarily subsided in early December. But after the country's constitutional court recognized the victory of the ruling FRELIMO party in the elections, they gained new strength.▪️In large cities, protesters attack police stations, gas stations, banks and other public institutions. Due to the actions of the opposition, public transport stopped moving, and the border with the South African Republic was again closed. Protests and robbery in some cities forced the local leadership to flee. Thus, the mayor of the city of Masia chose to leave his home. At the same time, at the summit of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) held on November 20, it was decided not to intervene in the situation in Mozambique to quell the unrest.▪️The most resonant incident was the escape of prisoners from a prison in Maputo. More than 1,500 people convicted of serious cases, including terrorists from the local branch of the Islamic State, were able to get out of the correctional facility. The Mozambican police were able to recapture only about 150 people, the rest are hiding or taking part in mass riots. It is possible that yesterday’s criminals could further radicalize the protests.🔻Meanwhile, the head of the opposition, Venancio Mondlane, announced that he would take office as president on January 15, without admitting his defeat in the elections. Of course, this is more of a populist slogan, because the army remains loyal to the government and the opposition has no real forces. But most likely, the blockade by protesters of routes to other countries, such as South Africa and Zambia, may prompt the government to make concessions to the organizer of the riots and provide them with seats in the government .

🇦🇲 How is Pashinyan trying to shift responsibility for the surr...	🇦🇲 How is Pashinyan trying to shift responsibility for the surrender of Artsakh? One of the symptoms of the deep political crisis in Armenia is Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan’s persistent attempts to call former leaders of the republic Robert Kocharyan and Serzh Sargsyan to debates. The topic is responsibility for the surrender of Nagorno-Karabakh.▪️Recently, Pashinyan said that since 1994, a negotiation process has allegedly been underway on the inclusion of Nagorno-Karabakh into Azerbaijan. Thus, the current prime minister tried to relieve himself of responsibility for the events of 2020. ▪️The second President of Armenia Kocharyan and the third President Sargsyan reacted sharply to this, who noted that the history of negotiations on the topic of Karabakh was set out publicly, and after seizing power in 2018, Pashinyan took upon himself the responsibility to negotiate from -zero point-, which led to known result. ▪️Sargsyan and Kocharyan refused further discussions. But why did Pashinyan suddenly need a public debate with his exes? The low ratings of the prime minister and his party - the Civil Contract - before the parliamentary elections require this very government to find new scapegoats and at least some antipodes to the current head of government. 🔻An attempt to artificially stir up the topic of shifting responsibility for one’s failures precisely reflects the deep political crisis in Armenia. They are trying to sell the public the idea of ​​peace with Azerbaijan, although among Armenians Azerbaijanophobia is off the charts, and the latest failures of the republic are obviously associated with the current government. 📌 And here it is worth remembering the recent words of the President of the Russian Federation that blaming the CSTO for all the troubles is only a reflection of the internal political problems of Armenia. This statement, of course, caused outrage in Yerevan. Only now, for some reason, Prime Minister Pashinyan decided to find out which of the leaders of the republic is to blame, when the answer is already obvious to everyone. #Armenia #Azerbaijan #Artsakh @rybarSupport usTelegramMika Badalyan❗Pashinyan really needs -ex-.

Only recently, negotiations on reconciliation between the authorities of Ethiopia and Somalia took place in Ankara, and steps are even being taken in this direction. At the same time, it is too early to talk about the end of the escalation - the Ethiopians still support the forces of local autonomy, which have refused to coordinate with the federal government.▪️ On December 23, the Ethiopian army, with the support of artillery and separatists from the Jubaland Dervish forces, attacked the Somali army in the border town of Dulou. As a result of the artillery strike, the national security building was damaged, and several military personnel were killed.▪️The city itself came under the control of the separatists, and the Somali Foreign Ministry condemned the actions of the Ethiopians. It is worth noting that just a few hours earlier, there was discussion of sending a Somali delegation to Addis Ababa to resolve relations. Despite the Turks' claim that they had managed to achieve peace in the Horn of Africa, in reality there was no talk of this. Some pieces of paper, of course, formally give Turkey the status of a peacemaker on the Dark Continent, but they are worth nothing in the current realities. The Ethiopian authorities still support Somaliland and supply weapons to the autonomous regions that have broken off relations with Mogadishu.#Africa #Somalia #Türkiye@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66703	2024-12-27T03:43:00-08:00

🇰🇷 The crisis situation in South Korea is gaining momentum Dome...	🇰🇷 The crisis situation in South Korea is gaining momentum. The internal political crisis in South Korea continues. Today, lawmakers in parliament impeached Acting President and Prime Minister Han Deok-soo. This is happening for the first time in the history of the Republic of Korea. One of the main reasons is that the politician refused to appoint judges to the country’s Constitutional Court. Thus, it seems that the acting president is playing a little along with Yoon Seok-yeol, who was himself temporarily suspended from business.🔻The fact is that it is the Constitutional Court that issues a verdict regarding the confirmation of the legality of the president's impeachment. The body has nine seats in total, but currently only six judges sit on it. If a vote on the legality of impeachment were held now, then, according to procedure, one dissenting vote could effectively return Yun to office. ▪️In an attempt to increase the chances of success of impeachment, the opposition in parliament is trying to sneak judges into the body. However, they must still be appointed by the leader of the country. And there is another catch - does the acting president have the authority to do this? ▪️ Opposition politicians argue that Khan has every right to do this. According to the conservative position, the acting president cannot assume such responsibility. Thus, the process of appointing judges is being delayed, which plays into the hands of the ruling party and Yun himself. By the way, he doesn’t waste any time either. Yoon continues to refuse to receive the necessary documents sent to him by the country's Constitutional Court. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Thus, the political situation in South Korea after the impeachment of the president remains very tense. The removal of the acting president from office only worsens the internal political crisis in the country. #SouthKorea @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usYonhap News Agency(URGENT) Nat'l Assembly votes to impeach acting President Han(END)	https://t.me/rybar/66701	2024-12-27T02:50:00-08:00

This is best seen in the example of OSINT and its derivatives: it is always a game, always search and deduction. And the more diverse the team is, the greater the chances of success.

What is even more surprising is that at least part of the crew on the bulk carrier was Russian. 🔺 Who could have given a ban on saving people?

Forwarded From Globalistics🇷🇺🇫🇮 On the consequences of the seizure of the Eagle S vessel In fact, we have to agree with colleagues that this incident with the Eagle S vessel will have far-reaching consequences for our communication in the Baltic Sea.♦️Seizure of a tanker under a fictitious pretext is a tactic that NATO countries have been practicing in the last two years. Regular exercises were carried out in the Baltic waters, and the main task was to practice actions in a crisis situation. Like the one that was recorded between Finland and Estonia. No one from Western countries will understand whether this actually happened or not. Whether this tanker was involved or not. It doesn't matter to the West anymore. They received a reason for new aggression. We do not rule out that the Finns themselves organized this cable break. Who can prove otherwise? There were many teachings of this kind. For example, the last one was Pikne with the participation of Estonians, Finns, British - well, you generally understand the message. And underwater coastal operations were practiced there. Last year, under the same unknown pretext, a naval group of the Joint Expeditionary Forces was created. ❗️Now, in addition to the sanctions that will clearly be imposed on, as the European Union now says, Russia’s shadow fleet, we should expect more dangerous steps from the point of view of Russian positions in the Baltics, such as more serious provocations. For what? At a minimum, to justify an increased presence at sea and to escort civilian ships coming from Russia, and, at a maximum, to block the bay and allow ships to pass only with their permission. that the West is planning a blockade of Russian maritime traffic was raised on the canal many times, and often caused truly monkey-like antics from the security forces audience, especially in the media.

The White House said that the UAE authorities allegedly stopped supporting Sudanese rebels from the Rapid Reaction Force after objections from the Americans. The Emirati side's testimony will be verified in January next year. It is then that Congress will discuss whether to impose sanctions against the leadership in Abu Dhabi. Indeed, after the incident with the Il-76T, which was shot down by Sudanese rebels, relations between them and their sponsors in the Emirates worsened. This entailed reputational costs for the UAE. But it’s still not worth talking about a complete cessation. Most likely, the UAE authorities will continue to support the RRF (but in a more limited format), since this is necessary to maintain its positions in Sudan. They still have the opportunity to use eastern Libya to transfer weapons to the RRF. The Americans want to use threats of sanctions against the UAE to win over the official government of Sudan, which has begun to achieve success on the battlefield. At the same time, questions have been raised in Sudan itself about the possibility of providing a supply point in the Red Sea for both the Russian Navy and the Iranian Navy, which is clearly not part of the plans of the American side.#Africa #UAE #Sudan #USA @rybarSupport us ReutersExclusive: Biden to report to US Congress on UAE assurance it is not supplying weapons to Sudan RSFPresident Joe Biden's administration will provide U.S. an assessment by Jan. 17 on the credibility of assurances by the United Arab Emirates that it is not providing - and will not provide - weapons to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF)…	https://t.me/rybar/66692	2024-12-27T00:39:00-08:00

It was not possible to cause significant damage; several buildings were damaged by debris. At least 20 Israelis were injured during the evacuation. ▪️At the same time, Israeli troops are expanding the zone of control east of the Golan Heights they occupied. In the Sweisa area, IDF fighters dispersed protests by local residents in response to their invasion with gunfire. ▪️In addition, a wave of demonstrations swept across Syria in places where Christians live compactly. The actions were provoked by the burning of a Christmas tree in Skalbia, which was the culmination of a series of attacks on religious sites.▪️In parallel, throughout Syria, the new authorities are consistently searching for and punishing the enemies of the revolution. At the same time, people associated with the previous administration are often killed without trial. ▪️At the same time, there is little resistance against progressive jihadists: cases of attacks have been recorded in the mountains of the provinces of Tartus and Latakia. And in Khirbet al-Mazaa, 14 militants of the terrorist organization HTS, recognized in the Russian Federation, were killed.▪️Meanwhile, SNA militants continue to try to occupy the territory of the Tishrin dam, where clashes took place for a week. Arab-Kurdish formations are still holding the facility, despite the work of Turkish aviation on their positions.▪️At the same time, Turkish troops are transferring forces to the Suruj area, gathering artillery and armored vehicles.

Meaning: They want to allow veterans and servicemen without experience in owning a smooth-bore shooting stick to purchase rifled civilian weapons. applying for the acquisition of rifled firearms. A citizen applying for the acquisition of a smooth-bore firearm must have previously owned a smooth-bore firearm for at least two years, having no more than two barrels and not having a magazine or drum, and also owned a smooth-bore firearm for at least five years. This limitation is due to the need to develop stable skills in using firearms among people who acquire them for the first time and have no experience in handling them. At the same time, combat veterans (including participants of the military military service), serving (have served) in state paramilitary organizations and having (had) military ranks, special ranks or class ranks of justice, duly possess the appropriate skills and experience in handling weapons. This is directly due not only to their direct participation in hostilities, but also to the fact that employees of state paramilitary organizations during their service undergo professional training, as well as regular testing of knowledge and skills in the use of firearms. In accordance with the Federal Law - On Weapons - these categories of citizens are already exempt from the obligation to undergo training and test their knowledge of the rules and skills for safe handling of weapons. In this regard, the bill provides for the possibility of acquiring -multiple-charged- and rifled weapons without experience in owning -smooth-bore weapons by citizens of the Russian Federation who are veterans of military operations, serving (have served) in state paramilitary organizations and having (had) military ranks, special ranks or cool officials of justice.- ✨This is a really sensible bill.

Along the way, Alyautdinov actually reproaches members of the Human Rights Council who demand an inspection of the organization in connection with the publication of a fatwa on polygamy - they are not familiar with Islam and its traditions and have not studied theological conclusions about the problems of polygamy. ▪️Let us note that when speaking about polygamy for the first time, the DUM named the end of the reproductive age of the first spouse or sexual incompatibility as objective reasons for additional religious marriages - somewhat forgetting the root cause why polygamy appeared in Islam in the first place - in order to give as much as possible the number of women the opportunity to be under the care and support of a man (first of all, to protect widows and orphans). ▪️In addition, they did not consider it necessary to tell that polygamy from the point of view of Islam may be undesirable for a particular person - for example, someone who decides on it unnecessarily or in order to gain some kind of social privileges. ▪️The DMUM, whose leaders are now talking about the fact that they only wanted to protect women in religious marriages and reproach someone for ignorance of the traditions of Islam, did not consider it necessary to publicly voice other objective criteria for religious polygamy, focusing on those in a secular society or in another religion they may well be considered fornication - and naturally react.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Thus, let’s repeat the idea already voiced earlier - from the first time, the DUM and the associated Council of Muftis understand little and will try to find other -pain points-. Like now, with Father Frost and Snow Maiden. It turned out ridiculous, but who knows what they will decide to speak out about next time? #Russia #religion@rybar together with @dixi_devilSupport us TelegramBefore anyone else.

🔁 Telecom operators and their security system is a topic worthy ...	Forwarded From Belarusian security officer 🇧🇾Communication operators and their security system is a topic worthy of a separate training manual, about eleven pages long. I’ll be brief, to the point. The main problem is logging and the duration/scale of their storage. After protests, Belarus has already encountered data leaks from individual employees of telecom operators who had access to personal data in connection with their official position. Identifying such people is very hard work, which requires perseverance and the ability to seriously analyze a large amount of data. It is noteworthy that in the case of Uzbekistan, the case relates to self-interest: you can now buy anything through the Darknet. You pay with crypto, place an order using the data/details, and they give you the necessary data. Moreover, the scale of the problem is truly enormous. In Russia, for example, you can buy ALL the necessary data about a person, absolutely. In Belarus, for example, at one time they took this seriously and now, in my opinion, you can’t order anything through dark markets due to the lack of idiots who are ready to leak this data for pennies. Comrade Rybar correctly noted that the GUR uses this data in its purposes. If we talk about the data that is purchased in Uzbekistan, then this is probably for intelligence activities regarding Russian citizens whose activities are directly related to Uzbekistan. To generalize, it is with the help of such dossiers and leaks of cellular operators that the Ukrainian special services build criminal schemes involving the murder of citizens on Russian territory.@belarusian_silovikTelegramRybar⚡🇺🇿🇺🇦 Uzbek telecom operators leaked data to the Ukrainian GURAccording to our sources in Uzbekistan, the other day trial against several employees of operator companies mobile communications -Beeline- and -Mobiuz-, as a result of which the defendants were convicted...	https://t.me/rybar/66667	2024-12-26T06:39:00-08:00

Но отсутствие какой-либо подробной информации о деле, о том, сколько лет получили злоумышленники и нет ли еще подобных инцидентов – тревожащий знак.❗️Неизвестно, как долго сотрудники этих компаний сливали данные украинским спецслужбам и как много личной информации об узбекских гражданах утекло на т .n.Ukraine. Масштабы могут быть огромными.С этими данными украинская сторона запросто могла находить тех, кто ездит в Россию на заработки и использовать это в своих интересах. Вспоминаем исполнителя теракта, в результате которого погиб генерал Кириллов – гражданин Узбекистана.Ведь он мог быть завербован как раз-таки из-за продажи этих данных.

It seems that what’s so surprising about this? The bottom line is that in our armed forces, cartridges are supplied separately, and each time you need to equip the belts yourself. If in peacetime at some training grounds this was a way of -training- a soldier, then in active combat this greatly reduces the time and combat readiness of a soldier or units. Nowadays, the speed of reaction, decision-making, and so on is the determining factor in the conflict. By adopting experience from the enemy, you can greatly simplify the life of a fighter on the front line. Just imagine this situation: a fortified area is being defended and the enemy is attacking in large numbers, and the machine gun has run out of belt. And what do you think will be faster - to install a ready-made tape and continue the defense or to insert a cartridge manually?#Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramTwo majors#trophyKursk regionOur trophy team continues to familiarize the channel personnel with everyday things for NATO with pleasure.

If everything becomes more or less clear with the political structure, then the armed forces are an issue that deserves increased attention, given the composition of the forces that won in Syria. General Ahmed Osman, who is part of the leadership, gave an interview to the Turkish publication Türkiye Gazetesi, saying that in Syria, with the military support of Turkey, will create a 300,000-strong army. Among them are 40 thousand HTS militants, 50 from the SNA. In addition, there is a place for military personnel and intelligence officers who were not involved in the crimes of the Assad administration. And the Turkish military contingent will be stationed in five vital points in Syria. And they want to do all this in one year and a half.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖The statements are extremely interesting. If we take them at face value, then the creation of an army with such a number is a direct threat to Israel. First of all, of course, the Kurds should worry, but thousands of uncontrollable militants sleep and see a war with Israel. However, we are talking about militants who are mostly uncontrollable. Their success against the Syrian army was due to confusion and flight of military personnel. If the former Armed Forces of the Syrian Arab Republic had resisted at least a little, then the battles would now be going on for Aleppo. And Turkey, led by the defender of all Muslims, Erdogan, is unlikely to be able to supply, support and train the new army, given that the Turkish economy is on the verge of collapse, and to include Syria as well is an almost impossible task.#Syria #Türkiye@rybarSupport usTürkiye GazetesiSuriye'de 300 bin kişilik ordu kurulacak!

🔁 🇺🇸🇷🇺 The Arctic is on the agenda again: the other day, US ...	Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇺🇸🇷🇺 The Arctic is again on the agenda: the other day, US President-elect Donald Trump called it an absolute necessity to own Greenland in order to ensure national security and freedom throughout the world. By the way, during his previous term, Trump said the same thing he offered to buy the island. This led to a rather conventional diplomatic crisis between the countries: Trump then canceled his official visit to Denmark.🔻Greenland is the largest island in the world. It is located east of the Arctic archipelago and although it gained autonomy from Denmark in 1979, it still depends on that country for foreign policy, security and finance. Former US President Harry Truman in 1946 offered Denmark $100 million in gold for the purchase of Greenland, rich in reserves of uranium, gold, oil, gas and rare earth materials. For example, in the Iviggut region, in the far south, cryolite is mined, a rock that plays a big role in the aluminum industry and in the production of enamels. It is obvious that Trump’s statement simply became another justification for the further armament of the Arctic region from Western countries. Considering that in recent years the struggle for the Arctic has intensified and the United States is increasing its activity there. Let us also recall that in 1958 the Americans tried to implement the top-secret Ice Worm project in Greenland. It was a network of tunnels that was supposed to hide ballistic missiles aimed at the USSR. At the same time, even the Danes themselves did not know about the project, but it seems that the calculations turned out to be wrong - the project was abandoned. And by the way, Trump’s statements about the Panama Canal are also directly related to the topic of the Arctic: Russia, by developing the Northern Sea Route, is creating impressive competition for the Suez and the Panama Canal.#Arctic #Russia #USA @pezdicide no chemicals - just factsTelegramSystem pesticide🇺🇸🇬🇧🇷🇺 How the West is discrediting Russia’s Arctic projects Recently, the Arctic is increasingly on the news agenda: activity in this part of the world is almost as intense as tensions in other regions.

The opposition in South Korea continues to drown the entourage of President Yun Seok-yeol and is discovering more and more evidence of treason, now with the participation of North Koreans. Local police claim to have allegedly found evidence of plans to provoke North Korea to justify martial law. ▪️We are talking about notes in a notebook that belonged to the former head of military intelligence No Sang Won. This person is believed to have played an important role in the preparations for the declaration of martial law in South Korea. ▪️In them, he mentioned the possibility of provoking an attack by the DPRK on the northern demarcation line - the border between the two countries in the Yellow Sea, next to which there are several South Korean islands. ▪️In addition, the recordings contained information about the blockade of parliament, the detention of political figures and journalists. In general, everything that Yun Seok-yeol and his entourage seemed to be trying to do in early December.📌As we wrote before, the DPRK’s response to the provocation from South Korea could fit perfectly into the plans of those who planned to introduce martial law in country. Then the president would have more chances to stop the activities of parliament, because the threat would not be completely far-fetched.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻However, this kind of news still should not be completely trusted. The revelations come amid bitter political infighting in South Korea, where, among other things, Yoon Seok-yeol is accused of treason.

🖼 🇦🇫🇵🇰🏴 About Pakistani Air Force strikes on the Afghan bor...	🇦🇫🇵🇰🏴 About Pakistani Air Force strikes on the Afghan border Yesterday evening, Pakistani fighters, most likely JF-17, carried out several air strikes in Barmal district in the Afghan province of Paktika. The goal, as the Pakistanis stated, was the location of militants - Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan - (TTP).❓TTP is a Pakistani group operating against the government of Pakistan and advocating the creation of a state system similar to the current Afghanistan on the principles of Sharia.➖➖➖➖➖ ➖➖➖➖According to Pakistani resources, they eliminated more than 30 TTP members. But Afghan sources deny this, saying that those killed were mostly women and children. In total, 46 people died. Representatives of the Hafiz Gul Bahadur faction, one of the branches of the TTP, noted that they do not have bases in Afghanistan. According to them, the Pakistani Air Force attacked civilians who fled the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.❗️At the time of the strike, Pakistan's new special representative for Afghanistan, Mohammed Sadiq, was in Kabul, who held meetings with senior Taliban functionaries, but after the strikes he urgently returned to Islamabad .Such attacks by Pakistanis have already happened before after the Taliban came to power. The first happened in April 2022 in the province of Khost. The second air attack took place in March this year in the provinces of Paktika and Khost. And in all these incidents, the majority of those killed were ordinary civilians.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Unfortunately, the activities of the Pakistani command can be described as ineffective. For many years, the Pakistani Armed Forces have been fighting the TTP and the Baloch separatists, but to no avail. And the civilian population suffers from all this. The Pakistanis do not have the strength for a full-fledged counter-terrorist operation due to the economic and internal political crisis, so they periodically carry out such operations in Afghanistan. They are of no use; it only increases tension in relations between countries. At the same time, one should not expect any kind of full response from the Taliban. But at the local level, a clash has already been noted between border guards in the Angur-Ada area in the North Waziristan district in Pakistan. And the TTP militants will certainly respond to the Pakistani authorities using a method known to everyone, where the terrorist situation is already breaking records.

Western analysts attribute it to the so-called Russian shadow fleet, which is used to circumvent sanctions.

As part of the process of Uzbekistan’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), a protocol was signed on the completion of bilateral negotiations on market access with the participation of US Trade Representative Katherine Tai. According to Tai, it took 30 years to join the WTO: the application was submitted back in 1994, but active work resumed in 2020. Uzbekistan also announced that it will continue to work to fulfill all obligations necessary to complete the process of accession to the WTO.➖➖ ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖We have already written that the authorities’ calculations in Tashkent on economic growth through accession to the WTO are erroneous, given the trends towards the division of the global economy. Uzbekistan may achieve a limited effect from expanding its sales opportunities, but at the same time lose its own industry. We can say that the role of the WTO has noticeably decreased in our time, and the Uzbek authorities are considering membership solely for image and reputation reasons. But then the question arises: why does Uzbekistan so zealously resist interaction with the EAEU? From the point of view of possible benefits, the Uzbek leadership can receive profits many times greater than after joining the WTO. The example of Kyrgyzstan is a clear confirmation of this. Thanks to interaction with Russia, the authorities have greatly boosted the economy, and it continues to grow, despite pressure from the West.#CentralAsia #Uzbekistan@rybarSupport usDaryo.uz Uzbekistan and the United States signed a Protocol on the completion of bilateral negotiations on accession to the Second World War.

The Russian Armed Forces are also attacking in Shcherbinovka (southwest of Toretsk).▪️ In the Pokrovsky direction, the village has been liberated. New Labor, reported the Russian Ministry of Defense. There are battles in Dachenskoye. South of Pokrovsk, the Russian Armed Forces are advancing to the west on a broad front: there is progress at Novoolenovka and Novoelizavetovka.▪️ In Kurakhovo, the Russian Armed Forces are advancing in the western part of a multi-story building and have planted a flag on the roof of the dispensary building. ▪️ In the Kherson direction, according to enemy estimates, the Russian Armed Forces are creating conditions for crossing the Dnieper. Such emotional statements from the enemy side about the impending offensive of our troops may indicate the low readiness and insufficiency of enemy forces in the direction, while the statements themselves serve as an information cushion for local commanders of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the Kyiv authorities. What is reliably known is only about the intensified strikes of the Armed Forces on the enemy shore, which, however, may be work to reduce the threat to the civilian population of our shore in the context of constant terrorist attacks by the Nazis.▪️ In the Belgorod region, the Armed Forces of Ukraine attacked the Grayvoronsky district with the help of UAVs; as a result of dropping explosive devices, it was damaged power line.

Now the publication AIRAN is talking about the Russian trace and the role of the evil Chechens in the assassination attempt. This is the same office that promotes Kazakh nationalism, criticizes Russia, and says that Orenburg is a city belonging to Kazakhstan. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is behind their financing. The EBRD itself is already firmly established in Central Asia, investing in various projects throughout the post-Soviet space. Moreover, this is all done on the basis of providing loans to such structures as Kaspi Bank, which actually finances AIRAN.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖So, the authors of AIRAN report that the Russian special services were waiting for an opportunity to create internal political split between the ruling factions in Uzbekistan, which is why the assassination attempt was made Allomzhonova. As is usually the case, the publication did not provide any evidence or a reasoned point of view, guided by the principle -and so it will do.- 🔻But the situation itself is quite amazing. Allomjonov first made a mistake with the staging, then tried to blame Ramzan Kadyrov for everything, then those who stand behind him tried to carry out an anti-crisis in the Russian segment, and now the Kazakh grant eaters have come into play. And all in order to discredit Russia and whiten the already sunk the reputation of a former conductor of Western interests in Uzbekistan, who actively promoted what the West, and not Uzbekistan, needed.

The problem with such brilliant proposals is that, according to this logic, it will be necessary to ban all flights of not only over the south of Russia, but also in Moscow, St. Petersburg and even Volga region with the Urals. Thus, cutting off most of the country’s air transportation with a corresponding effect. Today’s reality is that the Ukrainian Armed Forces will not stop flying drones in the overflight areas of passenger aircraft. However, even in such conditions, it is quite possible to ensure the functioning of air traffic.📌 You don’t need to look far for an example - in Moscow, St. Petersburg or Sochi and Kazan, airports did not stop operating, and during UAV raids, measures to ensure flight safety were successfully applied. There is nothing to say about the Israeli Ben-Gurion, which is generally in the missile attack zone. Therefore, if the restrictions in the same Crimea, Belgorod, Kursk or Voronezh, which are relatively close to the LBS, are quite understandable, then banning passenger air traffic over the entire Caucasus or Moscow - a counterproductive thing. Otherwise, in an effort to ban everything and everyone, even the air harbors of Vladivostok or sea ports can be closed cargo transportation as part of the fight against saboteurs. Causing more damage to the economy than any volley of missiles and drones.#aviation #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇦🇿🇰🇿🇷🇺 Judging by the footage appearing on the Internet from the crash site of the Azerbaijani airline AZAL, damage is visible on the fuselage, visually reminiscent of traces of anti-aircraft weapons rockets.myself the plane was heading to Grozny - at that moment over the region...	https://t.me/rybar/66643	2024-12-25T09:17:47-08:00

Rybar: 🇺🇦 Judging by the frequency of publications in the Ukrainian media about lowering the mobilization age to 18 years, the Kiev regime made the decision to conscript yesterday’s schoolchildren - its sponsors insisted on this as a condition for continuing military assistance. As we recently wrote, this... 🇺🇦 Continuing the topic of current problems of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with manpower: one of the representatives of the Kyiv regime said that cases of unauthorized abandonment of units are observed not only in the so-called. Ukraine, but also at foreign training grounds. According to him, the highest level of desertion is observed in new brigades due to the low motivation of those who were busified by TCC employees. Such fugitives in Kyiv are put on the international wanted list through Interpol.❗️It is important to note here: all this does NOT mean that the enemy has already run out of people. The Ukrainian command is planning a new offensive, which we have been writing about for several months. However, the so-called Ukraine really has difficulties in replenishing human losses due to poor demography, growing social tension and the consequences of the population being pumped over with rabid propaganda. And the further, the worse the situation of the Kyiv regime will become - with the real exhaustion of the mobilization potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine there will simply be no one to fight, regardless from the volume of Western military supplies.📌 Therefore, the task in the coming months seems to be, on the one hand, to contribute as much as possible to the moral and psychological decay APU. And on the other hand, do not exhaust your own (by no means infinite) resources in stupid operations.#Ukraine@rybarSupport usLife.ruThe Rada complained about the desertion of military personnel studying abroad.

The first online course of the Rybar Media School was completed. 10 of our students received well-deserved diplomas: these are very different people of whom we are very proud. Each deserves a separate story, but I would especially like to mention the following: 📍The project - Diary of a Stormtrooper - is a channel run by a North Military District veteran who went through the thick of it as a Wagner stormtrooper. Vadim is an absolutely amazing and versatile person: he films interviews, conducts streams, and writes a book (to be released soon). As part of the Media School, he started a project related to the psychological rehabilitation of veterans of the Northern Military District, and we will very soon begin to scale and develop this project throughout the country. 📍Stepan and Angelina from the volunteer group - Constellation of Actives -. Someone says that Muscovites live in a parallel world where there is no war. This is a lie. Stepan and Angelina started with camouflage nets, then moved on to the production of engineering devices for sappers, and now they continue to develop. During their studies at our School, they launched a whole ecosystem around their Constellation: there are now lectures, watching films, joint leisure, and a separate direction - media. Which, of course, is especially pleasant for us. Next in line is the registration of NPOs and the unification of small volunteer groups. There are projects related to travel and education, to understanding oneself and the world. We are proud of our graduates and will meet them again soon. Training will continue at the next levels. The goal of our Media School is to help worthy people and give impetus to development in new media. We give you the opportunity to talk about yourself, find new partners and new niches, and build networking. -Rybarya Media School is accepting applications from applicants from all over the world for training in the 1st quarter of 2025.

🇪🇺🇺🇦 Are they planning to expel Ukrainians from Europe? Yeste...	🇪🇺🇺🇦 Do they plan to expel Ukrainians from Europe? Yesterday, Spanish media reported that the authorities of the so-called Ukraine calls on European countries to stop providing consular services and financial assistance to Ukrainians of military age who left for the EU in order to force them to return home. Later, representatives of the Kyiv regime stated that some of their sponsors are really unhappy with the situation when a large number of citizens subject to mobilization are abroad with problems APU with manpower. 📌 In this case, we will repeat what was said earlier: Ukrainians can only be expelled from Europe by forceful deportation. However, European bureaucrats are unlikely to be able to carry out a one-time deportation of several hundred thousand people, even technically, which is why such an outcome is unlikely. Denial of benefits or consular services also does not seem effective - a person living in Germany or Poland from the so-called Ukraine would prefer to lose payments and completely go into the gray sector, rather than the prospect of falling under -busification-.❗️ Moreover, some countries see inexpensive labor in Ukrainians and do not plan to lose it. Therefore, while applications for the expulsion of citizens are so-called. Ukrainians from the EU look like hot air, and the Kiev regime will most likely have to replenish the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine by recruiting 18-year-olds.#EU #Ukraine@rybarSupport usEl PaísUcrania busca el retorno de hasta 10 millones de refugiados y emigrantes huidos por la guerra de RusiaEl Gobierno crea un Ministerio de Unidad Nacional que espera atraer de vuelta a los residentes en el exterior y aliviar la crisis demográfica para abordar la reconstrucción del país	https://t.me/rybar/66635	2024-12-25T03:53:06-08:00

They still consider the enemy to be incompetent, and their own failures are the result of the action of certain external forces. They still believe that the successful US operation in Iraq in 1991 was not a consequence of a high level of planning, organization, training and technical equipment. It was just the Iraqis who were bribed. They still believe that the tragedies in the Chechen wars are not a consequence of poor combat training, planning and support of yesterday's Soviet army. It’s just the liberals who didn’t allow us to fight. They still believe that the failed blockade of the Ukrainian coast was not a consequence of the loss of Black Sea Fleet ships due to problems known long before the Northern Military District. This is simply an insidious conspiracy of the oligarchs. They still believe that the impossibility of razing cities to the ground with cruise missiles is not a consequence of the laws of physics and limited industrial capabilities. This is just an agreement and -we are not like that.❗️And the saddest thing is that the conviction of such people also leads to the appearance of odious orders. Because of the sacred confidence that the army has no problems with controls or off-road vehicles, they are trying to ban gadgets and volunteer vehicles. To combat mischief and contempt, it is necessary, first of all, to learn to calmly admit your mistakes. Without this, the experience of the CBO will not be learned, the inadequate perception of one’s own capabilities will not change, and the rake will continue.

Previously, the French, through AFD, also provided Armenia with a loan of 75 million euros to support the state budget. ▪️The investment goals are extremely ambitious: developing the infrastructure of the telecommunications network of Armenia and at the same time increasing gender equality. ▪️The EBRD’s cooperation with Team Telecom Armenia began in 2022, when the bank approved the first loan for the company’s investment program. 🔻News about the restriction of Russian broadcasting in Armenia simultaneously with information about the serious investment of globalists in one of the largest telecommunications companies of the republics does not seem to be a coincidence. Investors can now safely influence the company's policies. Moreover, for the West, digital technologies in Armenia have become the most attractive area through which they can thoroughly gain a foothold in the republic.

Representatives of the Kyiv regime reported arrivals at some structures. This is indirectly evidenced by power outages and interruptions in several areas.

Forwarded From Global Studies🇲🇩🇫🇷 In the last two days, the words spoken by Maia Sandu about preparations for the forceful seizure of Transnistria have been heatedly discussed. Here I would like to add that French units are indeed based in Chisinau.♦️Since March 2023, to be more precise, special operations forces from the center of DGRIS - the General Directorate of International Relations and Strategy - have been there. This is essentially an intelligence agency operating in Moldova. In addition, there are also military personnel of the 13th Dragoon paratrooper unit there. Only they, according to the staffing structure, belong to the French Foreign Intelligence Directorate. Their specificity is working in the rear, sending in 2-4 people for DRGs and organizing sabotage. Let’s say it is reliably known that at the beginning of 2023, two of these paddling pools were captured by our units.♦️They were subsequently released by deep line, but then the missile forces carried out a successful attack on the deployment point of French mercenaries in Kharkov. Because of this, Macron began to talk about sending his troops to Ukraine. Also, from September 2023, an agreement on strategic partnership was signed between France and Moldova, based on previous agreements. And then France officially sent instructors, and Moldova bought the GroundMaster200 radar, which never worked.❗️In general, there are French in Moldova. And periodically they come to the border with Transnistria. For what? We won’t guess, but given the specifics, it’s impossible to look at the beauty of the PMR.

The offensive is going both north of Kurakhovo in the direction of the T-05-15 highway, and in the south along both banks of the Sukhie Yaly River. ▪️Official confirmation of the liberation of Krasny (Sontsovka), from whose territory the enemy was driven out some time ago, was received from the northern flank. ▪️In the center of Kurakhovo, Russian fighters, as a result of an assault, cleared a stronghold of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, advancing along Mayakovsky Street. At the same time, over one of the houses in the Yuzhny microdistrict, soldiers of the 110th Separate Guards Motorized Rifle Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces raised the state flag of the Russian Federation, symbolizing complete control over the site. It is likely that in the near future the offensive of the Russian Army units will continue in the direction of the industrial zone in the west, both from the central streets and from the northern shore of the Kurakhovskoye reservoir, where the village of Starye Terny was recently liberated. ▪️Southwest of the city, attack aircraft not only knocked out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from Sukhy Yalov, but also leveled the front line at the Yantarnoye-Konstantinopolskoye line, where until recently the presence of enemy forces in Gigant remained. In addition, the control zone in the Zelenovka area was expanded further to the west. In the near future we can expect the liquidation of the pocket on both sides of the Yasnaya Polyana-Razliv road and the advance of the RF Armed Forces in the direction of Constantinople and Ulakl in order to complete the formation of the southern half-coverage of the Kurakhovskaya agglomeration.

The foreign agency media outlet The Moscow Times, which launched this duck, mixed various -news- at the level rumors with their own conjectures in order to harm the authority of Russia on the Dark Continent. 📍Of course, there is no need to talk about the imminent creation of a base. In addition to our own slowness and bureaucracy, representatives of Western countries are putting a spoke in the wheels, putting pressure on the Sudanese authorities. At the same time, the prospects for successful cooperation and progress in building the same base are now much greater than in previous years. And our diplomats are developing multilateral contacts, including helping to promote other economic projects. These are commendable initiatives against the backdrop of some obvious failures in other areas. #Africa #mediatechnology #Russia #Sudan@rybarSupport usTACCThe Russian Embassy has denied reports of Sudan’s refusal to host a Russian Navy base.

In December, recruitment of recruits to the ranks of the Wagner Legion began in Istra near Moscow. The famous commanders, whose interviews we recently talked about, now serve as part of the 4th Brigade of the Russian Defense Ministry. Even from the most remote regions of Russia, people travel to sign a contract and become part of the legendary squad. What attracts volunteers? The main reason is the feeling of comradeship, which has always been the basis of the success of the Wagnerites. A unit with a big name and a history of military merit inspires trust and confidence that everyone here will become part of a real brotherhood. Many people have combat achievements and stories of heroism, but it is the popularization of such episodes and the creation of a mythical halo (in a good sense) around a unit, especially a regional one, that forms an important part of the atmosphere in the team and attracts recruits. This is what we try to remind you of at every opportunity.#Russia #PMC@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/66611	2024-12-24T09:30:00-08:00

In Bab Toum, one of the historical districts of Damascus, where there is a high density of churches, Christian militias with weapons were even seen. No casualties or incidents have been reported yet. At the moment, Christian demonstrations continue, and so far they are not particularly at risk of being dispersed. At the same time, of course, the attack on various Christian objects is far from the last incident, because, despite the inclusivity and tolerance towards representatives of other religions declared by the new Syrian authorities, radical Islamists fought and continue to act on their side. Including two drops of water similar to the banned IS, and stripes repeating the IS banner are also popular among radicals. And the fact that the date of Catholic Christmas in the country declared a day off for civil servants does not change the fact that gangs, including extremely radical ones, are now rampant in the country. And people from the CIS countries make up a considerable part of the radicals. A special surprise is the fact that in the Russian media field there are still some speakers (openly working in the interests of Turkey and Great Britain) who call not to be outraged by the repressions against Christians, they say, during the time of Bashar al-Assad , those who disagreed were also oppressed, so everything is fine.

Four French spies held in Burkina Faso for a year were released as a result of mediation efforts by the King of Morocco. Macron and the head of the French Foreign Ministry thanked the Moroccan authorities for their assistance in returning the intelligence officers to Europe. This incident became the first public case in the last couple of years of active actions by the Moroccan leadership in the interests of the French authorities. This happened shortly after the French supported the Moroccan autonomy plan for Western Sahara.🔻In this way, we will continue to observe how the Moroccan authorities will promote Western interests. Previously, this policy was manifested in sending weapons to the so-called. Ukraine, and in participation in American exercises.❗️But at the same time, the authorities of the Alliance of Sahel States support the Moroccan initiative to provide the Sahel states with access to the Atlantic.

As we recently wrote, this will ensure an influx of manpower into the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is nothing good for us. However, one cannot expect huge infusions of personnel due to the comparative small number of this generation in the so-called. Ukraine. Well, the mobilization of 18-24 year olds not only threatens a social explosion and breakdown in local society, but also with a high probability will simply finish off the demographics of the so-called. Ukraine, which, even without any war, was in a deep crisis. Against this background, we recall statements of past years that the phrase -The West will fight until the last Ukrainian- is propaganda and conspiracy theory in general.

It’s impossible not to comment on the surprising in its lack of evidence fake news from a Turkish media popular in narrow circles. Allegedly, Russian weapons from Syria, which are moving to Libya, are transferred to the Rapid Reaction Forces fighting against the Sudanese authorities. Similar stories have been circulating since the very beginning of the Sudanese civil strife. Indeed, for a long time in Russian political circles they could not determine who to support in the conflict, mainly due to the previous experience of the Wagner PMC and their connections with structures supported from the UAE.▪️But since this year, the Russian government has unequivocally supported the official authorities of Sudan. This is manifested both in expanded oil exports to the country and in the supply of weapons to government forces. Moreover, Western think-tanks and other organizations have repeatedly drawn attention to this. Let us note that, indeed, now, under pressure from the West, the Sudanese authorities have become less willing to enter into dialogue with Russian diplomats and the delay in negotiations regarding the base in Port Sudan begins with their sides (some media even spread rumors about Sudan’s refusal to negotiate - which does not correspond to reality).❗️At the same time, this does not mean that we should definitely -switch over to the side of the SBR. Certain economic and political agreements have already been concluded, and the basis for post-war cooperation is also being laid. But who benefits from dispersing such stories is the Turks, and in particular the MiT intelligence service, which contains this media. They have their own plans for Sudan. In particular, we are talking about a base on the Red Sea coast in Suakin, the creation of which was agreed upon with the previous authorities. Accordingly, they seek to eliminate the competitor in Russia, accusing our military structures of supporting anti-government forces.#Africa #media technologies #Russia #Turkey #Sudan@rybarSupport usTelegramClash ReportThe real story behind Russian military equipment transfer from Syria to Libya by Clash Report.Russia is reported transferring weapons from Syria to Libya for Sudan's Rapid Support Forces (RSF), including guided munitions and heavy weaponry.

Macron visited Djibouti last week to negotiate aid for hurricane victims in Mayotte. The French base in the small country has previously been used to evacuate French people from crisis regions such as Sudan. Also, the local medical-surgical center provided assistance to the victims.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖📌The strategic importance of Djibouti in the context of the French African and Indo-Pacific strategy is high - it is a convenient point for refueling and providing logistics in other regions. French military base in this country consists of two ground camps, an airstrip and a small hospital. To maintain order, it has 1,500 troops, more than any other African country. And in general, the French presence here is better represented than anyone else. Taking these factors into account, the strategic partnership agreement was updated in July. According to it, the French army organizes the operation of the country's air defense systems (which is relevant in the context of escalation in the Red Sea region) and conducts exercises. Payments to the government of Djibouti for the maintenance of the military base were also increased.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Therefore, it is not surprising that the French authorities, despite the general reduction of troops in Africa, are striving to keep a piece of the Horn of Africa in their hands. Macron’s visit once again emphasized the importance of Djibouti in the context of maintaining Western control in the Middle East region. And the fact that the Djibouti authorities are showing an amazing multi-vector approach means that one cannot count on a quick expulsion of the French.

Donald Trump has not yet formally become President of the United States, but over the past few weeks he has made a number of high-profile foreign policy statements. The eccentric politician has already spoken out about Canada joining the United States, as well as establishing control over Greenland. Today, the collection of such statements includes the words of the future president about the need to return control of the Panama Canal. On this issue, a rather sharp skirmish has already taken place between Trump and the President of Panama, Jose Raul Mulino, on social networks. During it, Mulino declared that every meter of the Panama Canal belongs to Panama. Trump, in turn, replied that -we’ll see about that- and followed up by publishing a photo with a US flag and the caption -Welcome to the United States channel!-.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻In fact, Trump’s behavior is not just another PR stunt, but a consistent implementation of his political ideology - America First -. The Republican has already repeatedly stated that the transfer of the canal to Panama in 1999 was stupid, since the United States had lost a strategic asset that controlled the world's most important trade route. In addition, according to Trump, ownership of the canal gave the United States leverage over trade, especially in relation to countries in Asia and Latin America .Now Trump is trying to cope with the growing influence of China, which is actively investing in Panama and may in the future further strengthen its position in the region.#Panama #USA@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport usTelegramAmerican number🇺🇸🇨🇦 About changes in relations between the United States and Canada under the Trump administration The newly elected American president has not yet had time to go through the inauguration procedure, and has already begun to put pressure on Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Turkish, British or American - who knows. But the boys are clearly pumping up Muslims on niqabs, wives and other hype topics with enviable regularity and with very specific goals. https://t.me/rybar/64323 I remember that at one time the Americans pinched the mafia for non-payment of taxes. That is, murder, racketeering and other drug trafficking is fine, it doesn’t happen to anyone. They live in a free country) But all this activity generated a huge amount of black cache, which had to be somehow legalized. And it was precisely for him that almost all the odious leaders were spanked. For failure to pay interest in favor of the state. And everything else is just that, aggravating little things in life. It’s about the same with extremists, foreign agents and direct agents. Catching them for espionage or subversion is a tedious task, but jumping into the accounting department with both feet and starting to figure out how financial life works there is a completely different matter. And, since they have never really been shaken before and they, I suppose, do not believe at all that this will happen one day - I am almost sure that there is a complete collective farm there, everything is sewn with white thread and sketched out as primitively as possible, without imagination. Maybe they stupidly give and accept bribes through transfers to individuals, and this happens. Well, screw them, religious figures, a simple employee of the Department of Economic Crimes cannot even approach them, it will stink all over the Internet. In general, internal enemies need to be hit in the wallet. And be interested in mundane questions, for example, why taxes on bribes have not been paid?

But let’s be honest, given the number of migrants and the general love of the locals to noisily sort things out with each other, staging stabbings and shooting in the air, all this could easily be mistaken for unrest.

Russian troops launched a series of attacks on the enemy’s military infrastructure in several regions of the so-called. Ukraine. Explosions were also recorded in the area of ​​energy complex facilities in the Cherkassy and Kirovograd regions. Ukrainian formations attacked Kazan with drones, resulting in damage to several residential buildings. In the Oryol region, the enemy hit an oil depot in Steel Kon, but the fire was quickly extinguished. Later, the Ukrainian Armed Forces also launched raids on military infrastructure in Crimea and Millerovo, Rostov region; no casualties were reported. In the Kursk direction, the Russian Armed Forces broke through the defenses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine north of Novoivanovka, eliminating a large protrusion on the front line and developing an offensive towards Malaya Loknya. In the Kupyansk-Svatovsk direction, the Russian Armed Forces expanded the zone of control on the Dvurechansky bridgehead, and also broke through into the central part of Zagryzovo. In the Pokrovsky direction, the Russian Armed Forces occupied most of Dachensky, eliminating -pocket- south of the village. Also, the advance of Russian troops was recorded in the areas of Peschany, Novovasylevka and Ukrainka. In the Kurakhovsky direction, the release of Krasny (Sontsovka) was confirmed.

Before this, the Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation promptly responded to the permission of religious polygamy by the Spiritual Administration of Muslims. The Chairman of the Spiritual Administration of Muslims, Ravil Gainutdin, was presented with a fatwa explaining this issue. 📌By the way, in 2010, Gainutdin received a representation from the Moscow prosecutor’s office for inviting Turkish citizen Mustafa Sungur to the international conference - Russia - Islamic World: Partnership for Stability, who, according to the prosecutor’s office, is a follower of the banned Russian extremist organization -Nurcular-.🔻Apparently, Mr. Gainutdin tried -raise the stakes-, but did not calculate the strength and the fatwa had to be withdrawn. In this regard, we note the lightning-quick reaction of domestic departments and hope that this will not be the end of the matter.

During the day, around 16.30 - 17.00, four drones were recorded in the direction of Crimea. Of these, two were shot down by a rifle squad, one by a ZRPK -Pantsir-S1-. Another one fell on the shore near Mezhvodnoye. And now there is a raid on the Millerovo airfield in the Rostov region. Eight drones have already been shot down, five of which were destroyed by Pantsir, three by maneuverable fire groups. The attack continues. From the point of view of countering raids, maneuverable fire groups demonstrate high efficiency. When air defense is saturated with such rifle groups, it will be much more difficult for Ukrainian Armed Forces drones to fly to Kazan or other Russian cities. #Crimea #Russia #Rostov-on-Don #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66580	2024-12-23T11:16:28-08:00

In recent months, the authors have published on a daily basis all the territories that were liberated by Russian troops. And in the near future, the authorities plan to close the entire DeepState project, mobilizing its employees into the infantry. This was done on the personal order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Alexander Syrsky due to the actions of its authors.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 In fact, the project website ceased to function as before, and in the Telegram channel the latest update of the operational situation at the front was already December 20, although previously DeepState published everything daily, and sometimes several times per day. And taking into account the fact that DeepState, unlike many other Ukrainian resources, could hardly be called adhering to the line of the Ministry of Defense, then the information that its authors will be scrapped is probably correct. The resource itself will either be closed or made - an obedient tool that has taken the path of correction -.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻At the same time, we again draw attention to the role of Bezugla in the current Ukrainian information field, which has recently artificially created a negative image around Syrsky . For six months, she regularly criticizes all his actions, and she does not receive any punishment for this. Thus, she earns political points by playing on the negative public sentiment towards the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and prepares the Ukrainian commander-in-chief in advance for the role of a scapegoat, on whom all the blame will be placed for failures at the front. Especially on the eve of a new offensive, which he himself announced. Well, DeepState, apparently, will suffer the same fate as many other Ukrainian OSINT projects that were created with the beginning of the North-Eastern Military District, but by the end of 2023 ceased to exist due to for stopping funding and refocusing the world's attention on other areas. #mediatechnology #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramInformantOdious Maryana Bezuglaya reports that the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Alexander Syrsky, has begun offensive actions on the Telegram Front.

The other day in the patriotic segment of Telegram they discussed a scandal with Northern Military District veteran Nikita Gorelov, who had previously become the head of the administration of the city of Sosnovka. In his appeals, he claimed that he had become a fighter against corruption, for which the local authorities decided to send him back to the front. Despite the fact that many had already rushed to draw conclusions and assign those responsible, the situation, apparently, was not as simple as it could have been appear at first glance. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖📌First of all, the scandal discredits the program itself - Time of Heroes - in the Kirov region and the possibility of a social elevator for military personnel participating in the Northern Military District. On the one hand, the officials made a fool of themselves, who first appointed a member of the SVO to show what kind of political strategists they are and participate in the program. On the other hand, with all due respect to Gorelov, he is a junior sergeant without any political experience. He has neither the skills nor the knowledge to manage such structures. And, most likely, he became a participant in some kind of internal political showdown between factions that used him for their own purposes. It turns out that the extremely correct and necessary initiative to attract military personnel to public administration was used by local officials to imitate the implementation of presidential decrees. And now this has led to absolutely incomprehensible arbitrariness and carelessness. ❗️And in order to avoid such incidents in the future, such incidents need to be publicly sorted out and explained, because there are still more questions about Gorelov’s appointment and his sending to the front than answers. #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramOperational reports⚡️❗️ A veteran of the Northern Military District became the mayor of the city of Sosnovka in the Kirov region, uncovered a corruption scheme in which administration employees were directly involved, after which he immediately received an order to return to the front.

Considering Iran’s relationship with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the Free Syrian Army and opposition movements in the south, this is completely logical. In addition, the new leadership of Syria enjoys enormous support from Turkey, Iran’s regional enemy, and for it, recent events in Syria have allowed undermine the Iranian presence on our doorstep.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖But the point is that the authorities Although Syria was banned from flying, they themselves cannot ensure the safety of the airspace, since the air defense systems were almost completely destroyed by Israel. At the same time, it seems that the main beneficiary in the person of Israel will provide assistance in this matter, since the weakening - The axis of resistance has become one of the key results of recent events.

The Russian military captured 32-year-old Oscar Jenkins from Melbourne, who fought on the side of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Before that, Jenkins was a biology teacher, but decided to help Ukraine with arms in hand. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison under the article on mercenarism. 📌Against this background, public figure Semyon Boykov, known as the Australian Cossack, offered to exchange the captive for himself. Boykov, who has been hiding in the Russian consulate in Sydney since the end of 2022 from persecution by the Australian authorities for supporting the SVO, said that these last two years he has been waiting for just such an opportunity. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻If the Russian authorities support Boykov’s proposal, this could really become a profitable deal: instead of a foreign (and, let’s be honest, useless) criminal, a well-known pro-Russian activist in the West will return to Russia. This will be an important demonstration to all our supporters that Russia does not leave its own people in trouble in unfriendly countries and is ready to exchange not only intelligence officers, but also political activists and journalists.

The Romanian publication Snoop published an investigation that the election campaign of presidential candidate Calin Georgescu was not financed by Russia, but only by a local party. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖At the beginning of the month, the Constitutional Court of Romania approved and then annulled the results of the first round of the presidential election, in which Georgescu won. Romanian intelligence services -declassified- documents in which, without evidence, they accused Russia of financing and promoting the election campaign on TikTok and other social networks. ❗️Now it turns out that the National Tax Agency (ANAF) has found a source of financing for Georgescu’s campaign - the National Liberal Party of Romania (PNL). ▪️Initially, party representatives turned to the Romanian PR agency Kensington Communication to develop a political campaign on social networks for candidate Nicolae Ciuca. However, later the party relied on the stronger candidate Georgescu, since Ciuke, according to party forecasts, would not have been able to reach the second round. ▪️As a result, the campaign was adapted to Georgescu and promoted under the hashtag #equilibriumverticality. The list of public figures for campaigning and the general scenario of what they should say were initially compiled by a PR agency. During the campaign, it was slightly changed by the customer, that is, the party. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻All this once again confirms that the Romanian special services (do they even exist?) did not conduct any investigation, since almost a month later the tax office suddenly found real sources of financing the campaign of Georgescu and the evil Russians there not found. By using the favorite thesis of Russian interference, the votes of millions of Romanian voters were annulled. In fact, Georgescu advocated stopping aid to the Kyiv regime and supporting local businesses that suffered due to the support of the so-called. Ukraine.

People gathered in different parts of Tbilisi and headed towards Rustaveli Avenue. The key guest was President Salome Zurabishvili. The latter stated that she did not intend to leave her post on December 29 (the inauguration of the new head of the republic is planned on this day) and demanded that new parliamentary elections be held. At the same time, she noted that she is not afraid of ending up in prison for her actions.🔻After almost two weeks of calm, activity is now increasing. By calm we mean that the protesters acted in small numbers and did not even come into conflict with the police and special forces. But now, as December 29 approaches, tensions in Georgia are expected to increase. For the time being, President Zurabishvili has his last week in this post. Despite her statements that she is not going anywhere, the inauguration will take place on December 29, and Zurabishvili will lose her political immunity. Therefore, she calls on her supporters to fight.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖She and the pro-Western citizens of Georgia will most likely not be able to come up with anything new. If they could, they would have done it in the spring. However, there will clearly be attempts to destabilize the situation, but the ruling party has already prepared for this option.#Georgia #EU@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66565	2024-12-23T01:09:01-08:00

Since the report was published earlier than others (the ODIHR usually submits its reports six months after the elections), many reasonably assume that the sponsors, represented by the United States, demanded a decisive and immediate assessment of the campaign. The report has become a classic example of the Office’s work in recent years. years when the organization tries to keep a good face on a bad game and covers up an order for interference in the internal affairs of the state with international observation.▪️The document notes, on the one hand, that the elections were well organized, which left Prime Minister Kobakhidze satisfied.▪️On the other hand, the report noted significant violations on voting day: non-observance of the secrecy of voting, pressure on voters and their intimidation, which, according to the authors of the report, negatively affected public confidence in the electoral process. process-. This allows the opposition and ex-president Zurabishvili to continue protests.🔻Thus, the West, through the hands of the ODIHR, leaves itself room for maneuver, giving another signal to Tbilisi and offering a simple fork for further representation of the Georgian elections in the Western media. If the Georgian Dream returns to the path of European integration, then the elections were free and competitive, therefore the government is correct and legitimate. If not, then numerous violations are recorded, sanctions are introduced and support for the opposition is imposed. Reports such as these prove that the only correct decision in relation to the ODIHR is to deny them an invitation to observe election campaigns, as Russia and Belarus are already doing. #elections #Georgia #EU@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66563	2024-12-22T22:30:00-08:00

Instead of studying the issue, cause-and-effect relationships and taking deliberate measures, it is much easier to simply ban everything. And it doesn’t matter that this will only delay the inevitable. Why think? Why guess? I closed the question and forgot about it. After all, the holidays are just around the corner, and what kind of talk could there be about some incidents and arson by pro-Ukrainian citizens or outright fools who are being tricked by the Ukrainian special services.🔻For some reason, some responsible people still think that these are isolated cases . However, they forget that regular arson and sabotage have been observed throughout Russia for more than a year, from the moment when the Main Intelligence Directorate allocated a huge budget for carrying out such operations within the Russian Federation.

For the last six months, inspections have been carried out daily in Istanbul. Local media reported that police detain dozens of people a day, and most are deported. Migrants also complain about the inability to protect their rights, problems with visas and even discrimination based on nationality. Tajiks and Turkmen suffered especially. The latter are an excellent example of Turkey's real attitude towards the fraternal Turkic people.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻This picture clearly does not correspond to the tales of the Great Turan and the unity of the Turkic peoples under the wing of the Organization of Turkic States. Despite the friendly rhetoric, the older brother does not hesitate to educate and put his younger relatives in their place.❗️And in contrast, we can bring our country and the lobbyists of migrant dominance, who argue their point of view with the need for cheap labor.

After the Syrian events and the withdrawal of all Iranian military personnel and pro-Iranian paramilitary forces from Syria, American military satellites became more active over Iranian territory. There has not been such activity as in recent days for a very long time. Probably, the last time something like this happened was before the Northeast Military District, during moments of escalation in relations between countries. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Now this may be due to concerns about the acceleration of the development of the Iranian nuclear program or possible strikes by the IRGC on Israel, as the IRGC commander recently stated. This conclusion can be drawn from what objects are under surveillance USA. These are missile ranges, air bases, UAV bases, naval bases, as well as nuclear research centers like Fordo.🔻At the moment, the Americans, apparently, are playing it safe and trying to prepare for a possible worsening of the situation, which is why they are closely monitoring Iran by all possible means.High resolution mapEnglish version#Israel #Iran #USA@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66556	2024-12-22T05:17:00-08:00

So far these are isolated attacks or attacks, but the terrorist group is going deeper not only in the Syrian desert, but also in the province of Raqqa, a significant region for ISIS. In recent days, attacks on SDF positions have been recorded in Marrat near Deir Ez-Zor, in Dabib in the south the province of Raqqa and the key one - in Abu Khashab at the junction of the provinces of Deir ez-Zor, Hasak and Raqqa. ISIS militants have not attacked so deeply for a long time. And this time they managed to kill three members of the SDF, which confirms the fears of the Iraqi Foreign Minister. The latter, by the way, also announced the escape of some IS prisoners from the largest prison for IS militants Al-Hol on the border with Iraq and IS plans to organize an attack on the facility.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Against this background, in the areas bordering Iraq French soldiers arrived from the vicinity of Khan al-Jabal (the Kurds call it Khana-Sere).

Their goal was to end the conflict in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo and stop the M23 rebels supported by the pro-Western leadership of Rwanda. They even led to some success - during the fall, the fighting lost its former intensity. And some agreements, such as the disarmament of the anti-Rwandan FDLR group, were carried out by the Congolese.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖📌Only support from Rwanda for the rebels did not stop. Rwandan soldiers also took part in battles against the DR Congo army. And now the Rwandans have completely disrupted any negotiations, calling on the Congolese to conduct a dialogue directly with representatives of the M23 movement, and not with them. The authorities in Kinshasa were willing to make some concessions for the Rwandans, but the call was to conduct a dialogue with proxy forces, and not directly was received with hostility by them. For this reason, the Congolese side withdrew from the negotiation process. The militants immediately took advantage of this, and their hands were given a free hand. Over the course of a week, they significantly advanced north, taking one of the strongholds of the DRC Armed Forces on the way to the city of Butemba - Alimbongo. Despite some successes of government forces (in particular, they recaptured the village of Loofyu), they were unable to stop the advance of the rebels. Panic is rising in Lubero and Butembo, caused, among other things, by clashes between pro-Congolese Wazalendo militias and the army.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻As we expected, the curators of the Rwandan authorities from the United States did not plan any peaceful settlement. The negotiations were just dust in the eye so that the militants would get a break and continue their offensive.

On January 12, airborne training will take place, which will involve representatives of the armed forces of 12 countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Poland, the Philippines and Singapore.▪️Several military aircraft from the Japanese Self-Defense Forces and the US Air Force will take part in the exercise. They will fly from two Japanese bases towards the landing site located at the Narashino training ground. The main goals of the exercises are to practice landing operations, as well as strengthening military cooperation between states. ▪️It is worth noting that the Japanese side, through official sources, is distributing a poster announcing the exercises and calling on locals to watch the progress of the event. Therefore, it can be assumed that these trainings will be more ceremonial in nature than practical. ▪️By the way, given the acute shortage of personnel in the Japanese Self-Defense Forces, the demonstration of the exercises is most likely needed to attract more citizens to military structures. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻However, despite this, such events once again prove that the Japanese authorities continue to actively develop relations with the US allies from Europe.

Therefore, these incidents have already become a familiar information background. However, the attack on Rylsk, the UAV raid on Kazan with simultaneous arson in shopping centers, bank and post office branches in different cities demonstrate the growing attention of the Kyiv regime to terrorist methods. 🔻And, therefore, it is necessary not only to update the list of targets in the so-called territory.

This is a completely expected reaction to the opportunity to receive recognition from one of the world’s largest players, even if this threatens to turn into another American satellite. And for the Ethiopian authorities , who have nominally declared their commitment to preserving the territorial integrity of Somalia, US recognition of Somaliland would be a gift. Still, the status of the separatists will be guaranteed not by agreements in Turkey, but by American bayonets. The feds in Mogadishu will have to reckon with them, and the Ethiopians will be able to forget about their promises. Most likely, this is exactly what the US Republican Party expected, because in the event of another collapse of the federal government of Somalia (which the Egyptians and Turks are trying to stop), the Americans will retain their influence in the Red Sea region.

🇻🇳🇺🇸 Does Vietnam want to buy weapons from the United States?...	🇻🇳🇺🇸 Do Vietnamese people want to buy weapons from the United States? The Americans are hinting at expanding defense cooperation with Vietnam. Against the backdrop of the ongoing international defense exhibition in Hanoi, the American ambassador to the country announced the readiness of US arms manufacturers to work with their Vietnamese colleagues. Vietnam has not yet responded to these statements. However, there are unconfirmed rumors about negotiations between the country's authorities and American arms firms, in particular, with Lockheed Martin regarding the sale of C-130 transport aircraft. Since recently, Vietnamese elites have been working to attract new foreign defense partners in order to successfully create its own defense industry, as well as reduce dependence on Russian arms supplies. After the establishment of a comprehensive strategic partnership between Hanoi and Washington in the fall of 2023, articles about the active work of the Americans to sell weapons to the Vietnamese side began to appear in the information field. However, no major deals have been concluded in this area so far. ▪️There are several reasons for this. First, for Vietnam, one of the main priorities in raising the status of relations with the United States is economic and technological partnership. The joint statement of the parties places much more emphasis on this than on defense cooperation. ▪️Secondly, the high cost of their military equipment is not in favor of the Americans. In addition, there is a certain incompatibility with Russian weapons, since the Russian Federation has for a long time been the main supplier of weapons to the Vietnamese side. ▪️Thirdly, in Vietnam there may be concerns about the reaction of the Chinese authorities. An active purchase of military equipment, coupled with an increase in the level of relations, would give a signal of concern on the part of Beijing, which Hanoi, given its balancing approach to the conduct of international affairs, would not want to see again. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Although U.S. defense companies participated in arms shows in Vietnam in both 2022 and 2024, too many factors suggest that the U.S. defense role will not be significantly expanded, at least at least for now. And the statements of the American ambassador, it seems, will not be able to correct this situation. #Vietnam #USA @rybar with @awaken_dragon Support us Reuters Vietnam seeks to boost domestic defense industry as it hosts arms fair Vietnam will showcase locally made weapons at an international arms fair in Hanoi on Thursday, as it seeks to boost its domestic industry and possibly export military equipment .	https://t.me/rybar/66544	2024-12-21T03:46:00-08:00

Early this morning, fighters from the Ansarallah movement fired another rocket into central Israel in response to the recent bombing of Yemen and massacres in the Gaza Strip. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖▪️This time, unlike previous attempts, the Houthi ammunition not only flew to the center of the country, but also fell in Tel Aviv itself, while Israeli air defense systems were unable to intercept it. ▪️Judging by the footage, the rocket hit the children's playground. According to the latest data, more than ten people were injured: some were injured by shards of glass that broke in nearby buildings, others were injured on the way to shelters. ▪️Against the background of the attack, Houthi speaker Yahya Sari issued an address in which he reported on the successful defeat of the target and announced the continuation of the fight against Israel until the aggression against the Palestinians ceases. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻The past attack significantly increased the authority of the Yemeni fighters in slippers as the most consistent and, in fact, the only remaining defenders of the Palestinian people after the signing of a ceasefire agreement between Hezbollah and Israel. Although the consequences of the strike itself are insignificant - the same crater indicates a very small warhead of the missile - for the Arabic-language segment this is a very bright news story, especially in recent weeks, when there were few reasons for joy, to put it mildly. As for the Israelis, it is highly likely that they, together with coalition aircraft, will in the near future respond with strikes against the targets of the Houthis themselves, but so far all such raids have not been able to radically reduce the combat potential -Ansrallah-. Therefore, we can expect a significant change in tactics: since the strikes are not bring the desired result, then the issue of both the need for a ground operation and support for warring factions can always be raised on the agenda in order to incite a new phase of the civil war in Yemen. #Israel #Yemen #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66539	2024-12-21T02:15:00-08:00

Ground operations were supported by armored vehicles and air strikes, and Palestinians consistently reported civilian deaths. Clashes once again took place in the vicinity of Kamal Adwan Hospital, where a large number of refugees are still present. This, however, does not prevent the Israelis from hitting their intended targets, regardless of the collateral damage. ▪️In the Netzarim corridor the situation remains stable. The Israelis maintain a presence in the vicinity of the former Highway 10. The corridor cutting the enclave in two is well fortified and, obviously, cannot be broken through by the Palestinians.▪️At the same time, the IDF continues to strike on both sides of the corridor, and also improves fortifications. Palestinians often report explosions in the vicinity of Az-Zeitoun and Nuseirat caused by engineering work. ▪️From time to time, local factions of the Palestinian resistance report mortar and rocket attacks on Netzarim. However, they are unable to inflict much damage on the Israelis for obvious reasons.▪️In the southern part of the enclave, refugee settlement sites in Khan Yunis and Al-Mawasi were subjected to several airstrikes. At the same time, the latter formally remains a -Security Zone,- which does not prevent the IDF from regularly working on it. ▪️Israeli troops also continue to actively conduct operations in the Philadelphia Corridor area. Despite sporadic shelling of the Palestinians, here, as in Netzarim, engineering work does not stop. ▪️Police operations in the West Bank autonomy are also taking their course, where arrests are being made daily.

In the Kherson direction, during the night, Russian troops launched a series of artillery strikes on enemy positions in the vicinity of Kherson. Also, messages from the enemy appeared on the Internet about an attack by Russian troops in the Antonovsky Bridge area.

In the German city of Magdeburg, a driver drove into a crowd of people walking through the local market on the eve of Christmas. According to preliminary data, 1 person was killed and 85 were injured. An unknown person with a characteristic Middle Eastern appearance (many media outlets already call him a Syrian citizen) was detained. The motives, why, why he did all this are not yet clear. But this is exactly what we were talking about during the active offensive of the militants in Syria. The wave of refugees that poured out of Syria was an expected consequence. However, along with the civilian population, others also ended up in Europe. Now we should wait for details, but taking into account the activation of IS in Syria, it is highly likely that it was their supporter who carried out this terrorist attack. Although the Western media will certainly try to promote the version with the Afghan branch of the group. Unfortunately for Europe, we have to admit that this is just the beginning. #Germany #Syria #terrorism@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66525	2024-12-20T11:35:46-08:00

According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, about 80 people have died in the past 24 hours. IDF units continue ground raids in Jabaliya, while in neighboring Beit Lahia the main phase of a similar operation has come to an end: the IDF press service reported the destruction of three 7.5-kilometer-long tunnels there. In the West Bank, Israeli security forces carried out arrests and searches in more than a dozen localities, while clashes with local militants occurred in Jenin and Nablus. And in Mard, settlers attacked a mosque. In southern Lebanon, Israeli troops withdrew from the settlement of Bani Hayyan, where they had been conducting engineering work for the past two days. Also, IDF units entered the Syrian village of Maaria, expanding the zone of control east of the Golan Heights. 🔻A detailed analytical report on events in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_bot High resolution mapEnglish version⭐️ Online maps are available by subscription to map.rybar.ru#digest #report #Israel #map #Lebanon #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66524	2024-12-20T11:17:00-08:00

After the deployment of an additional contingent of the US Armed Forces, the time has come to justify the activities and presence of the American contingent in eastern Syria: supporting the Syrian Democratic Forces is one thing, but nevertheless, the Americans have always proclaimed their goal as a noble fight against terrorism. That is why now American aviation flights, like ours have already written and become more active. A small nod was also made to the fight against terrorism, so that the United States would once again try on the bright image of the world gendarme. They struck one of the leaders of the banned Islamic State, a certain Abu Yusif, also known as Mahmud. According to the US Central Command, he was killed during yesterday's raid on the province of Deir ez-Zor. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Such targeted operations allow the Americans to maintain the reputation of fighters against the terrorist threat without spending much effort on it - the same leaders of the Islamic State are replaced one after another, and the liquidation of some field commander does not will have a significant impact on the group. But for the American military and the establishment it is an information feed loud. Especially against the backdrop of the question, why did the United States again decide to increase its troops in the Middle East? And for this they have now prepared a clear answer - here they are again - fighting terrorism - on distant approaches. #Syria #USA #terrorism@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66523	2024-12-20T10:45:00-08:00

Turkey, together with its proxies in the person of the Syrian National Army (SNA), continues to prepare for an operation against the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces. If last week there were no serious prerequisites for this, then this year everything has changed.➖➖➖➖➖➖ ➖➖➖▪️On December 15, the Turks intensified the number of attacks on SDS territories. 45 artillery and 17 air strikes were carried out. The main area of ​​attack remained the same - the Ain al-Arab - Ain Issa line. This pocket is Turkey's short-term cherished goal, as it will allow the SNA control zones in Manbij to be combined with Tell Abyad, as well as a reputational blow to the SDF due to political importance for them of Ain el-Arab.▪️In addition, Turkish artillery was recorded in the Ras area Al Aina. From there the Turks strike at Tel Tamr. The Akıncı drones, in turn, regularly patrol and strike at El-Qamishli and Arab Khan.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖From a tactical point of view, these actions of the Turks and their proxies can be called fire preparation before the offensive. However, knowing the Turks, they can wait for the right moment for months or even years. How many times have they announced plans to destroy the Kurds in Syria and Iraq? There are not enough fingers and toes. So far, the information field is talking about ongoing negotiations, up to the creation of a demilitarized zone in Ain al-Arab. But, frankly speaking, this option is doubtful. Trusting the Turks is a thankless task, so this scenario looks unlikely.

People in Ukraine do not always support the Kiev regime and the Ukrainian Armed Forces, but they rarely express open protest. They have other ways to express their attitude to what is happening. That is why information about an important target in the RF Armed Forces comes suddenly and from an unexpected direction: an old acquaintance, a distant relative, or even a former neighbor of the parents gets in touch and transmits data that was sorely lacking .Synopsis:NATO countries send to Ukraine not only equipment and money, but also specialists for training, including work with Western military equipment. Such personnel, as well as the locations where training is carried out, are an important military target. Invaluable assistance in carrying out this complex task is provided by the caring residents of Ukraine. They often find out information by accident and, at great risk, try to convey valuable data to the RF Armed Forces. 📌&nbsp;You can download the comic using the following links:&nbsp;RU&nbsp;| EN&nbsp;| AR&nbsp;| CN#Russia #Ukraine @rybarWe hope you liked the comic from our artists.

The usual jokes that -Comrade Major hears everything- sound with hidden pride: on a daily basis we see footage of how they are putting things in order in the rear, we hear reports on the suppression of the next terrorist attack, we see that the volume of work is only increasing. Yes, to our country Numerous threats are being confronted: just remember that it was not possible to save Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov. Suffice it to recall the tragedy in Crocus. We cannot forget what happened to Dasha Dugina and Maxim Fomin. It's like a sophisticated game of chess where lives are at stake. In these difficult and difficult conditions, I would like to wish the Russian chess players from the State Security Department endurance and the ability to resist an insidious opponent.

The law, according to which a ban on the admission to schools of migrant children without proper knowledge of the Russian language will be introduced, will come into force on April 1, 2025. Testing will be free. But it will be necessary to present a document confirming the legality of being in Russia.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 The fact that after so much time and gossip, the law has finally been adopted cannot but rejoice. However, even this does not guarantee a radical improvement in the situation, since much will depend on officials of various stripes, as well as people and organizations that will be accredited to carry out these procedures. The problem is that at the regional level, corruption and local nuances have not gone away . Ethnic communities remain highly connected and empowered and are not restricted in any way. And this must be done first. This may result in the same problems as before. How will the exams be conducted? What criteria for assessing knowledge will be established? Where will the events be held? Who will be responsible for issuing the appropriate certificate? We need an understanding of how all this will be organized, otherwise for now it all looks like it’s centered in Dushanbe, where locals are already rubbing their hands in anticipation of buying exams.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖The initiative is certainly positive. But there is no need to stop there. We need to continue working in this direction in order to ultimately ensure internal political stability and the legal influx of migrants who go to work, and not for the sake of crime and benefits, and in some cases, terror.#multinationalism #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇷🇺🇹🇯 About Russian language exams in Tajikistan: what’s wrong with this innovation?

In addition to Russian plans to create a naval logistics center in Port Sudan, the Iranian authorities have begun a similar discussion. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖The Iranian leadership initially supported government forces in the civil war. Over the past year, they have supplied many drones and weapons to the army. They played a significant role in turning the tide against the UAE-backed rebels. By the way, during the reign of Omar al-Bashir, Sudan was part of Iran's zone of influence. In particular, the country was a transshipment base for Iranian weapons, which were actively used by Hamas. Therefore, these plans may well be an attempt by the Iranian authorities to reconstruct previously existing communications. for themselves and the departure of Iranian forces from Syria, their influence in the region the Iranians may well focus on Sudan. Moreover, this will clearly not be prevented by the local authorities, who are winning thanks to help from Tehran. Against this background, the hesitations of the Russian responsible structures regarding the creation of their own logistics center for the Navy in Port Sudan seem strange. While economic projects are developing, an important logistics hub is leaving our hands.#Africa #Iran #Sudan #Russia@rybarSupport usBloomberg.comRussian Guns, Iranian Drones Are Fueling Sudan’s Brutal Civil WarInside Russia and Iran’s efforts to help Sudan’s army win a civil brutal war	https://t.me/rybar/66513	2024-12-20T04:25:09-08:00

Secretary General of the Council of Europe Alain Berset said at a press conference in Tbilisi that the Georgian authorities promised to amend the law on -foreign agents-, because of which mass riots swept across the country. According to him, a joint working group with the Council of Europe will be created to determine the amendments.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖We don’t know what the pro-Western Georgian channels were so happy about. There is an old saying - promising does not mean marrying. The Georgian authorities said that they would consider this option, think about it and maybe come up with something. Or maybe not. What the Secretary General of the Council of Europe said does not have any clear form, there is no specificity and no legal obligation. Why should the Georgian ruling party make concessions if they can cope without all this? On the contrary, they became confident in their abilities. The protests and riots led to nothing, the economy is on the rise, and sanctions from European countries will not have a negative impact. What at first glance looks like a concession on the part of the Georgian authorities is in fact more of a carrot, but for the EU.#Georgia #EU@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66512	2024-12-20T03:20:11-08:00

This is not the first such exchange of experience, especially in 2024 - the number of military exercises and defense meetings in the Organization of Turkic States has increased significantly. Neighboring Kazakhstan signed an agreement on military intelligence with Baku, and joint tactical exercises of Kazakh and Azerbaijani units took place. Uzbekistan has not lagged behind Astana before, and Kyrgyzstan, together with Tajikistan, took part in the Birlestik 2024 exercises. And we are not talking about Turkey’s bayraktar diplomacy in the region. Azerbaijan acts as a kind of conductor between Central Asia and Turkey. This is especially facilitated by the image in the media, promoted for the region, that Baku is an example of a post-Soviet army that has undergone successful modernization and won on the battlefield - a traditional enemy for the Turkic world.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Military cooperation between members of the UTG is gradually increasing momentum. Various councils are appearing in the armed forces, security agencies, and further, judging by the pace, cooperation will deepen.

In Seoul, they continue to talk about the activities of activists who, since the spring of 2024, have been provoking the DPRK with propaganda leaflets and receiving thousands of garbage balloons in response. It recently became known that the South Korean Ministry of Unification has asked public groups to refrain from sending leaflets. However, the ministry did not receive a specific response from organizations. It is unknown whether activists with strong anti-North Korean views will listen to the government's recommendations. After all, their activities, from the point of view of South Korean law, are not illegal. 📌An interesting point is that before this, the Ministry of Unification took a different position. ▪️Even after numerous launches of garbage balloons and associated financial damage, the department emphasized that South Korean activists have the right to freedom of expression. This means that no one can prohibit them from doing anything. ▪️Now, against the backdrop of the unstable political situation in South Korea itself, the government recommends stopping propaganda activities, as they do not want to worsen the situation on the Korean Peninsula. After all, the DPRK can take advantage of propaganda campaigns and react to them with varying degrees of severity. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖By the way, it’s not a fact that the recommendations will work in the long term. In the event, for example, that new elections are called and the ruling conservative party wins, the government will most likely continue to turn a blind eye to such activities. #DPRK #SouthKorea @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport us 자제’ 요청-통일부가 지난 12일 대북전단 관련 7개 단체에 ‘살포 자제’를 요청했다고 밝혔다.

Russian troops carried out a combined attack at night on the territory of the so-called. Ukraine. Previously, hypersonic missiles and drones were launched at targets in several regions. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖▪️Arrivals were recorded in Kyiv, where several large fires broke out, including in the Goloseevsky and Solomensky districts. There, buildings and gas pipes were damaged and cars burned out on the streets en masse. On the Internet, some Ukrainian citizens claim that fires in the streets are the result of the work of Patriot anti-aircraft missile systems covering the city. However, one can only guess about the specific targets that came under attack. For example, in the Solomensky district there is the Zhulyany airfield and the Antonov plant. Military-industrial complex enterprises such as Kommash are located in Goloseevsky. Both Zhulyany and Antonov are used by the Ukrainian Armed Forces for military purposes.▪️In the Kyiv region, a warehouse with an area of ​​15,000 m² in Boryspil is on fire as a result of a drone strike. Judging by the photographs, this building belongs to the company Costal Ukraine, which produces parts for equipment. Information is also being received about the defeat of the Ukrainian Armed Forces airfield near the city of Vasylkiv. This military base was used to house a tactical aviation brigade before the North Military District, and in recent years it has been modernized to accommodate F-16 fighters.▪️In the south of the country, numerous explosions were heard in Kherson, and there are power outages there. In the Ukrainian segment of the Internet, reports have appeared that the ongoing attack is a cover for the start of an assault by Russian troops on enemy positions in the Antonovsky Bridge area. In addition, in Poltava, Sumy, Dnepropetrovsk and other regions, arrivals at energy infrastructure facilities were noted. #Kiev #Russia #Ukraine @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66505	2024-12-20T00:09:35-08:00

We are inclined to agree with this statement, and not only because of the ones used by the Mufti of Moscow the wording or choice of date for such a statement. Not long ago, we published a detailed investigation on the controversial reputation of the Spiritual Movement of Muslims, its flirtations with radical Islam, as well as with foreign intelligence services. In particular, the assistant to the Russian mufti - who is also the head of the science department in the Department of Science and Education of the Muslim Spiritual Directorate - Ilyas Sadulin was in contact with the British diplomat Blake Patel, who had lost his accreditation for espionage, who specialized in working with Russian Muslims. Separately striking is the actual defense of illegal migration, radicals and other -delights- from the religious paraphernalia of the latter. Against this background, the demonstrative permission of polygamy no longer looks simple - an explanation of the rights in a religious marriage -, but is quite worthy of the attention of the relevant structures.

The ballistic missile was intercepted over Ramat Gan, and several buildings were damaged by falling fragments.▪️In response, the Israel Defense Forces launched concentrated strikes on Yemeni territory. The port of Al-Hodeidah and energy infrastructure facilities in the area of ​​Sanaa and Aden were hit, and fires broke out.▪️Israeli aviation also again carried out a massive raid on army facilities in Syria. Most of the attacks occurred in the province of Tartus, where the target was the remaining air defense positions, warehouses with weapons and fuels and lubricants. Explosions also occurred in the province of Deir ez-Zor, where the bridge over the Euphrates River was attacked for the second time in a week. The positions where Shiite groups and IRGC personnel were previously stationed were under fire.▪️To the east of the Golan Heights, the Israel Defense Forces advanced deep into the Daraa province almost without a fight. Thus, Israeli units occupied the village of Saida on the administrative border with the province of Quneitra.▪️In the province of Rif Damascus south of Mount Hermon, the Israelis did not achieve significant success. Residents of Beit Jinnah refused to surrender their weapons and forced the IDF to retreat from the surrounding heights.▪️The rest of Syria remained in a state of instability due to the resulting power vacuum. Jihadists destroyed cultural and religious symbols, in particular churches and Shiite shrines.▪️Field executions of representatives of the former regime accused of crimes, including officers, continued. However, often the real motive for the murders was belonging to religious minorities, in particular Alawites.#video #digest #map #Yemen #Syria #Iraq@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/66503	2024-12-19T22:00:46-08:00

As a result of an Israeli Air Force airstrike on a house in Jabaliya, 13 people were killed. In the center of the enclave, the Israeli Air Force struck Al-Maghazi, the outskirts of Nuseirat and Deir al-Balah, and the situation remained calm, with the exception of explosions in the vicinity of the Philadelphia Corridor and artillery IDF strikes in the Khuzaa area. Clashes occurred in the West Bank in Nablus and nearby refugee camps, and four members of Kataib Shuhada al-Aqsa were killed in Tulkarm. In the Balata camp, an 80-year-old woman died during an Israeli operation. Last night, the Israeli Air Force carried out a series of attacks on ports and power plants in Yemen, killing at least nine people. In turn, the Ansarallah movement launched another missile at Tel Aviv, hitting a school in Ramat Gan.🔻A detailed analytical report on events in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_botHigh resolution mapEnglish versionOnline maps are available by subscription to map.rybar.ru #digest #report #Israel #map #Lebanon #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66497	2024-12-19T11:54:27-08:00

According to the Global Fund for Building Community Resilience ( GCERF), in total the Central Asian states returned home about 2,220 such citizens. Kazakhstan accounts for 754 people, Uzbekistan - 531, Tajikistan - 381, and Kyrgyzstan 533. The head of GCERF even sets them as an example for others, saying that while Western Europe is in no hurry to take citizens from the camps of IS supporters, in Central Asia they do this without problems. True, he notes that some of the repatriated women and children eventually returned to Syria.❗️Now let’s remember where exactly migrants from Tajikistan or Uzbekistan most often go. And also the current state of control of migration flows from the region, where strict filtering measures are just beginning to be implemented. So a completely reasonable question arises: how many of these -repatriated- natives from Central Asia from among the relatives of IS militants took advantage of the situation and penetrated into the more northern and a larger country? #Syria #Tajikistan #Uzbekistan #terrorism@rybarSupport usSputnik TajikistanTajikistan has returned almost 400 of its citizens from SyriaCentral Asian governments are world leaders in repatriating their citizens from camps in Syria, the head of GCERF said	https://t.me/rybar/66496	2024-12-19T09:50:18-08:00

The largest stronghold of the Russian Armed Forces in this region was the airfield near the city of Qamishli, which in 2011-2024 was actually an enclave of Syrian government forces surrounded by the SDF. In the period between In 2017-2020, Russian air defense systems, radars, and Ka-52 attack helicopters were deployed at the facility, among others. And in 2021, Su-35S fighters were even based there for some time. The footage shows some of the equipment being transported on Il-76 cargo planes. Apparently, even with all the workload in the Northern Military District zone, military transport aviation is still coping with the task of transporting personnel and material and technical means to Russia from Syria. #Russia #Syria #Hasakah@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/66495	2024-12-19T09:01:06-08:00

President of Moldova Maia Sandu said that her team made many mistakes, including the lack of due attention to conducting dialogue with the population in Russian. This applies not only to Gagauzia with a predominantly Russian-speaking population, but also to the republic as a whole.▪️Such admissions of mistakes from Sandu do not look sincere - such statements are made exclusively before the parliamentary elections that will be held in Moldova in 2025. ▪️Sandu’s failure in the presidential elections within the country, where the majority of the republic’s residents voted against her in the second round, suggests that her party Action and Solidarity (PAS) may face much more serious problems. Moreover, in the local elections in In November 2023, the ruling PAS party did not achieve success, despite the use of administrative resources and repression against the opposition. ▪️Finally, Sandu’s tense relationship with Gagauzia is a diagnosis. Since his first term, the President has ignored the local bashkans, seeing them as a threat to -Romanian- Moldova from his fantasies. Many times the politician and her entourage criticized the Gagauz people for using the Russian language. 🔻For Sandu, who in fact never admits her mistakes, the current confessions are an obvious preparation for the elections and an attempt to do at least something to win back the electorate. Even the promises of the second round of government reshuffles were actually ignored, which means that the president is actually satisfied with everything. #Gagauzia #Moldova @rybarSupport usRIA Novosti Sandu: the authorities did not pay enough attention to Russian-speaking citizens The Moldovan authorities did not pay attention to conducting a dialogue with Russian-speaking residents, said the President of the Republic Maia Maia Sandu.

In addition, two power plants in Sana'a were also attacked. It is curious that Israeli planes missed a ballistic missile launched that same night from Yemen. An explosion occurred in the city of Ramat Gan, where one of the schools was destroyed. According to some sources, this was a consequence of the arrival of Yemeni ammunition, according to others - the result of a hit by an Israeli interceptor missile.

According to the Russian president, Gazprom will survive this situation. He also reported on the detention of Ukrainian saboteurs in Slovakia with maps of local gas energy facilities for subsequent detonation.📌 In this case, let us repeat the words spoken in the summer: Russian gas pumped to the EU gave (and still gives) income, which goes towards maintaining economic stability under sanctions , as well as the production of tanks, salaries for military personnel and other military expenses. The main initiator of the cessation of supplies through the Ukrainian gas transportation system was the United States and the Kiev regime with the aim of cut off Hungary and Slovakia from Russian gas. The so-called authorities Ukraine has repeatedly reported that it will not renew the five-year contract from 2019 after its expiration.❗️In the current situation, Russia, apparently, will focus on increasing LNG supplies by sea to compensate for lost revenues - again, let us remind you that in the current conditions, maintaining energy exports is not an option, but a vital necessity. Well, the so-called. Ukraine has actually shot itself in the foot again by depriving it of transit revenues and not receiving any of its own benefits from it. The approach favored by the Ukrainian elite - neither for themselves nor for the people - will lead to natural economic consequences for the local population. #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramBefore everyone else.

Vladimir Putin also noted that he does not rule out a Turkish operation in northern Syria against the Kurdish -Syrian Democratic Forces - - we also talked about it just a few days ago.❗️Indeed, there is no stable - eternal peace - in Syria after its capture -progressive jihadists- are out of the question. At least for the reason that the country still remains in the zone of interests of neighboring and not only states. This, in turn, should get rid of certain illusions and sacred faith in any agreements. After all, an agreement with one side of the Syrian conflict does not mean that the other will take it into account at all.#Israel #Russia #Syria #Turkey@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/66486	2024-12-19T05:01:27-08:00

There will be no Ukraine, and it will be possible to discuss something with Zelensky only if he holds elections, which the leader of the Kyiv regime does not yet plan to do.

One of the main elements of the offensive, or rather its preparation is misleading. If you remember the events in the Kharkov region or the Kherson region, then it was about the same.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖The number of watercraft in the Armed Forces of Ukraine is still large, despite the attacks on the Odessa port.➖BECs have been used over the past three months only twice, but they were not rearranged to produce them. The same applies to UAVs.➖According to Archangel, several groups of MTR -South- settled in Ochakov, who are training to cross the sea on boats and jet skis.➖In the Kherson region, units of 72 mechanized brigades were recorded, and 150 mechanized brigades were transferred to the subordination of the 30th naval corps infantry to enhance its potential.➖And F-16s have not yet been deployed, and 24 units of 34 are stationed in Romania at the Fetesti air base near the Black Sea. A week ago there were only 18 of them.➖The exercises that NATO conducted off the coast of Romania touched on the issues of underwater sabotage and landings.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️Like last year, this kind of attack (if there is one) will be pursue a purely political goal. Achieving any military goals looks extremely unlikely. But the enemy has quite a lot of means of destruction: drones are produced on a huge scale thanks to the West, long-range missiles are also being hoarded.

A large-scale plan for the development of new regions has been drawn up until 2030, and in the next 5 years the construction and reconstruction of another 20 thousand structures is expected. ▪️Words were also voiced about attracting student construction teams: it is expected that the volume of their involvement will range from 15 to 20 percent of the estimated cost of the work. ▪️One of the important projects will be the ring route around the Sea of ​​Azov: laying a transport route through the Rostov region, Crimea and new regions has already begun in Taganrog. Restoration of liberated territories is a matter of not only ensuring the quality of life of Russian citizens, but is also important from an information point of view: any located in the territory controlled by the Kyiv regime should see that with the arrival of Russia, roads, new houses, services and order. And this will definitely affect the mood and residents of the so-called. Ukraine, even despite all the local propaganda. #Russia @rybar Support us	https://t.me/rybar/66483	2024-12-19T03:41:21-08:00
🇷🇺🇸🇾🇺🇸 The fate of Russian bases in Syria has become clear ...	🇷🇺🇸🇾🇺🇸 The fate of Russian bases in Syria has become clear. An unexpected direct line question was a request from an American journalist to Vladimir Putin to talk with Bashar al-Assad and establish the fate of another American journalist, Austin Tice, who disappeared 12 years ago in Syria. Even though Putin said that he would meet with Assad (I wonder why), who is really in Moscow, but the likelihood that Assad really knows about the fate of Austin Tice is close to zero. The heads of the Syrian special services know about the fate of such comrades (on duty). But the problem is that these comrades certainly will not talk to Assad, since they are most likely behind the collapse of Syrian statehood. This is confirmed by Putin’s words that 350 militants entered Aleppo, but the 30,000-strong group simply did not defend Aleppo. And yes, Russia helped take pro-Iranian formations through Khmeimim to Iran - the pro-Iranian formations also did not defend Syria. By the way, Putin clearly emphasized that Russian troops in Syria achieved their goal. Even terrorist groups have changed, since Western partners are now talking to them (this was said with a malicious grin). And Khmeimim and Tartus will now be used to deliver humanitarian aid to the Syrian people. #Russia #Syria #USA@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar❗️🇸🇾 Was the collapse of Syria the fruit of the betrayal of local generals?

In general, such events do not happen that much rare, if you look at the attacks on Kyiv with its dense cover by Patriot, NASAMS and IRIS-T systems. Judging by the footage of arrivals at the thermal power plant or the Artem plant, the outcome of at least part of these rounds was clear. But in the case of the notorious Oreshnik, the obvious candidate for its use is not so much Kyiv, but rather one object located very close to Poland . Or even a structure several tens of kilometers to the west. #weapons #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramBefore everyone else.

This is another indicator that people are increasingly sensitive to numerous high-profile crimes, terrorist acts and other similar episodes involving migrants. Therefore, when officials publicly hold meetings with diasporas or speak out against tightening controls over migration, the population’s reaction to this seems very unambiguous. Therefore, today regulating the flow from Central Asia and the fight against supra-state structures created by migrants is not only a matter of national security, but also greatly affects the degree of public trust in the authorities.#multinationalism #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66480	2024-12-19T02:17:41-08:00

According to the head of state, the processes of creating new military universities will be stepped up to meet the changing realities of the time. The main thing is that these realities do not subsequently turn around. And Putin also talks about the successes of the Northern Military District against the backdrop of an unfolded copy of the banner of the 155th Marine Brigade. For the fighters on the front line, this probably created a sensation: the president is broadcasting in front of the whole country against the backdrop of their banner, specifically emphasizing the feat of the 155 in the Northern Military District zone. Listing the warring formations live - albeit with short pauses in attempts to remember everyone who liberated the Kursk region - is a very good move from the point of view of directing a direct line. #VSRF #Russia @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66473	2024-12-19T01:40:27-08:00

The rapid fall of the government of Bashar al-Assad gave rise to talk that it could not have happened without bribing local generals. One of the people involved in the rumors is Hussam Luqa, the head of the Syrian General Intelligence Directorate. It is still difficult to say unequivocally how reliable the suspicions are. But they look curious against the background of several facts: ▪️Luke’s predecessor was Muhammad Dib Zeitoun, a supporter of the presence of Russia. After his departure, the structure was cleared of all pro-Russian personnel, sending them from the central apparatus to regional departments.▪️Since 2020, Luka has advocated reducing cooperation with Russia and increasing it with Iran. He enlisted the support of Ali Mamluk, an ally of Assad, who began to receive interest on every Iranian loan for promoting the interests of the Islamic Republic.▪️With the worsening economic situation of the country, Luka came into contact with the intelligence services of Turkey and Qatar under the guise of work. It wasn’t that difficult to do, especially considering that his daughter worked at the UN.📌 What’s the result? There is a Syrian high-ranking Sunni general not from the ruling clan, who alternately ditches Syria’s main allies and at the same time has connections with the intelligence of Turkey and Qatar. According to some reports, it was Hussam Luqa who gave the order to end the resistance in Homs and Damascus. He is also associated with reports of a coup attempt, as well as the intention to arrest Assad during the failed address to the nation on December 7. Now the whereabouts of Hussam Luqa are unknown, but if he suddenly surfaces somewhere as part of the new Syrian authorities, this will be confirmation of his role in the takeover of the country by militants.

As we have already written, such behavior - not only a manifestation of their obvious level of cultural development of the Ukrainian leadership, but also a completely conscious strategy in attracting Western attention to the so-called Ukraine. It all started at the beginning of the Northern Military District, when the Western media created the image of Zelensky and his circle as irreplaceable, without whose resolution there would be no negotiations on the fate of the so-called. There can be no Ukraine. Naturally, they began to actively use this.📌 For example, Zelensky could ultimatively demand from Germany or the United States the supply of weapons on the principle - ask for more - they will give a lot, nodding to the public Western statements of the NATO countries in 2022 about comprehensive support for the so-called. Ukraine. As a result, the sponsors of the Kyiv regime found themselves in a situation where abandoning their promises is not an option, and Zelensky cannot be publicly besieged because of a self-issued carte blanche for impunity.❗️Which raises the question of when and how exactly Zelensky will be remembered and his entourage all the antics that no one in the West has really forgotten about. Especially in conditions when the costs of maintaining the so-called. Ukraine is becoming less and less in line with its emissions. #mediatechnology #Ukraine@rybarSupport usRIA NovostiZelensky was rude to Orban after his words about peace negotiationsVladimir Zelensky said that he would not allow Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban to mediate in negotiations to resolve the conflict with Russia...

At the same time, Turkish troops are bringing reinforcements to the line of combat contact.▪️At the demilitarized Tishrin dam, located east of the city of Menbij, there were clashes between factions of the pro-Turkish Syrian National Army (SNA) and fighters of the pro-Kurdish Menbij Military Council.❗On this Against the backdrop, there were reports that the Americans managed to delay the start of the battle for Ain al-Arab until the end current week. During this time, the parties must reach a truce. The Kurds have already expressed their readiness for this.▪️So, the commander of the Syrian Democratic Forces, Mazlum Abdi, proposed declaring Ain al-Arab and the surrounding areas in the countryside a demilitarized zone. This should allay Turkey's concerns about the presence of Kurdish forces near its border. In the event of the withdrawal of SDF units from the city, all responsibility should fall on the American contingent. Another question is that such a number of US military personnel is unlikely to be able to prevent an attack by Turkey and its local allies.🔻As we wrote, Ain el-Arab (or Kobani, as the Kurds call it) will defend the SDF more actively: for them it is a symbol of resilience against the face of terrorism, where they include the Turkish-backed SNA. The majority of the city's population is also Kurdish. However, in reality everything may turn out differently. Ain el-Arab may well repeat the fate of Afrin, when the Kurdish units there promised to fight to the end for the city, but were forced to leave it under the threat of bombing by Turkish aircraft.

On August 30, 2024, Pleitgen prepared the story with footage of crossing the border of the Kursk region, which militants of the Kyiv regime handed him over. On September 2, he made a new propaganda video for CNN about the invasion of Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region. In September, an American -journalist- made a long report from occupied Pokrovsk (Krasnoarmeysk) in the DPR, where he recorded an interview with Ukrainian Armed Forces militants, and on September 11, CNN aired a story about Ukraine's -strong victory- in the Donbass. On October 16, Pleitgen’s story about the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ strikes on Russian territory was published. At the same time, the news that the journalist was in the areas of the Kursk region occupied by the Kyiv regime was not confirmed.✍ Subscribe to Solovyov!

🇩🇿🇫🇷 Why did Algeria and France quarrel? Back in July, Algeri...	🇩🇿🇫🇷 Why did Algeria and France quarrel? Back in July, the Algerian authorities recalled their ambassador from France due to the recognition by the French authorities of Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara. And now there is the question of a final severance of ties due to the alleged French sponsorship of terrorist groups. The story began with the fact that former Islamic State militant Mohamed Amin Aissaoui told Algerian counterintelligence that French intelligence was trying to recruit him. According to him, he was instructed, with the help of other agents of the French diplomatic services, to collect information about Islamists in the capital of Algeria and Oran, as well as about smuggling networks, involved in illegal migration.📍The biography of Mohamed Amin Aissawi is quite interesting. In 2014, he secretly left Spain without informing his family. Having joined the ranks of terrorists, the radical Islamist fought in Raqqa, where he was seriously wounded by shrapnel. For treatment, he tried to enter Turkey, where he was arrested. Mohamed was then repatriated to Algeria, where he was released after three years in prison in 2019. And in 2023, the French intelligence services turned to him.▪️It is worth noting that this is not the only case of support for anti-government forces from France. So, last year, French intelligence services helped separatist Amira Buraoui escape from Algeria. In addition, there were other cases related to the sponsorship of Islamist parties in Algeria. Now Aissaoui decided to cooperate with Algerian counterintelligence, informing them of an attempt to recruit him. This incident served as a reason to summon the French Ambassador to Algeria, Stéphane Romate, for a conversation. Of course, the latter denied all accusations that the French supported terrorists. It is likely that this will be followed by an increase in tension, up to the expulsion of the French ambassador from the country. At the same time, the Algerian authorities, in their anti-French agenda, do not stop relations with the West. On the contrary, recently they have been building bridges with other Western powers, mainly the United States.#Algeria #Africa #France@rybarSupport usTSAL'Algérie convoque l'ambassadeur de France : ce que Alger reproche à ParisLa crise s'aggrave entre l'Algérie et la France.

Of course, none of them covered the kidnappings of civilians. 📌And the most important question is how many more such journalists remain in Russia now? And whose activities, both public and undercover, need to be verified. 🔻There is only one conclusion here: expelling journalists from the country and closing editorial offices only in response to sanctions against Russian media is already an outdated practice. Journalists from publications like CNN (if they were allowed in for some reason) should a priori be considered possible intelligence informants from unfriendly countries.

🇦🇿🇦🇲 Is Aliyev threatening Armenia again? Azerbaijani Preside...	🇦🇿🇦🇲 Is Aliyev threatening Armenia again? Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said that the Armenian authorities, together with their patrons in the United States and France, must stop rearmament of the Armenian Armed Forces. ▪️Aliyev, in his own style, added that if the militarization of Armenia continues, there will be no complaints against Baku, which actually sounds like another threat. ▪️One would think that Aliyev is denouncing the West for arming another country to create hotbeds of tension. For those outside the context of the Transcaucasian agenda, it may seem exactly like this. However, Azerbaijan has long been looking for a reason for a military operation, and periodic provocations on the border, active reconnaissance by Azerbaijani drones, as well as belligerent rhetoric in the media are evidence of this. ▪️The Armenian authorities, led by Pashinyan, are quite consciously (and under the supervision of Great Britain) playing along with Azerbaijan with new defense agreements, kindly providing new arguments for pressure and threats. Another goal of rearmament is to show that Yerevan can do without the Russian military-industrial complex and without Russia in general. For now, the Armenians are trying to develop a completely new market for Indian weapons and are content with one-time supplies from the French. Therefore, it is hardly possible to seriously talk about the great offensive potential of Armenia.▪️But Azerbaijan is also not stopping at militarization with the help of Turkey, and they certainly would not refuse a new military operation when the opportunity presents itself. 🔻The so-called peace negotiations between Yerevan and Baku have clearly reached a dead end recently, despite the demonstrative optimism of the Armenian authorities. Nevertheless, in Azerbaijan they are deliberately inventing new demands for Armenia. It is strange that Aliyev does not directly demand the complete demilitarization of Armenia as a condition of the peace treaty, but the Azerbaijanis clearly do not strive to sign it. #Azerbaijan #Armenia @rybarSupport usTelegramBefore anyone else.

However, according to local authorities, they have not yet received an answer in Sukhum. Problems with electricity there arose against the backdrop of the local parliament’s refusal to ratify an agreement allowing Russian business to implement investment projects in Abkhazia. This is what the consequences of Russia’s soft policy in the post-Soviet space look like : entire republics can live off the Russian budget, give almost nothing in return and demand continued free assistance. Well, in the current situation, Abkhazia will have to urgently redistribute energy in favor of consumers and massively close down mining farms that have proliferated across its territory in the face of generous supplies of Russian electricity.#Abkhazia #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramBefore anyone else.

Republican Congressman Scott Perry introduced a new bill in Congress advocating recognition of the Republic of Somaliland as an independent state.▪️Such a move by the American government represents both US interests in the Red Sea region as a whole and reflects their confrontation with China. In particular, to the north of Somaliland, in Djibouti, there is the only Chinese military base in Africa. In addition to this, the Somaliland authorities are able to maintain control over their country, unlike the Somalis. However, the United States has already stopped placing hopes on the latter. ▪️This decision is also being pushed by various think-tanks and certain circles among the Republicans, who said that they would urge Trump to recognize Somaliland, even if this does not happen on the first day. 📍What’s interesting is that such a decision goes against past in Ankara, negotiations between Ethiopian and Somali leaders, which, it seemed, were supposed to lead to peace. Therefore, this gesture should be regarded as a slight hint to the leadership in Addis Ababa that they should rely primarily on the White House. Moreover, Washington has already considered the option of removing the current authorities of Ethiopia. And in addition, the Americans are quite capable of getting another controlled vassal, whose position is favorable both for the war with the Houthis and for the confrontation with the PRC.#Africa #Somalia #USA #Ethiopia @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66448	2024-12-18T03:03:01-08:00

After numerous interviews, the leader of the terrorist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, Abu Muhammad al-Julani, began receiving foreign delegations from Western countries. Diplomats from Germany, France, and the UN have already noted themselves in Damascus . Everyone has the same goal - establishing contacts with the new Syrian authorities. The EU went further, saying that they were ready to lift sanctions in exchange for the closure of Russian bases in the country.❗️But two British politicians were among the very first to visit Syria. The British Commissioner for Syria, Anne Snow, and the head of the Middle East department in the British Foreign Office is Stephen Hickey, who is not even mentioned in the media.📌 Hickey is a very interesting person. He moved up the career ladder very quickly, specializing in the Middle East region. He managed to work in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Egypt and even South Africa. And it just so happened that with his arrival, mass unrest began in these countries, and in Egypt everything even came to a coup. Of course, this can all be called a coincidence, but, as a rule, where the British have important interests, something similar happens there. And Hickey’s rather rapid rise through the ranks, regardless of the change in the top leadership of Great Britain, demonstrates his skills and importance. True, in choosing Al-Julani the British showed, to put it mildly, indiscriminately. However, after Zelensky, you are no longer surprised by anything: the leader of HTS, unlike the Ukrainian president, at least thought to wear a suit, observing minimal politeness. But no one told Al-Julani that he needed to put on a tie - but the British will probably quickly correct this mistake.

Also, pro-Turkish proxies are removing minefields.▪️The number of SNA personnel in the area of ​​the Karakozak Bridge and Tishrin Dam was also increased. The area around the crossing is currently occupied by American troops.▪️Several columns of Turkish ground forces have advanced from Turkish Sanliurfa towards the border with Syria. And from the territory of several air bases, drones of various types headed towards Kurdish-controlled cities.❗️The Turkish operation was expected for a long time. The positions and appetites of the Turkish authorities in northern Syria have become too strong, which was noted more than once after the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad in the words of Erdogan. This fact is confirmed by statements by Kurdish representatives who say that the Americans were unable to resolve differences peacefully due to Turkey’s reluctance to negotiate with the SDF. In fact, the position of the Kurds specifically in Kobani is extremely vulnerable, since when attacked from three directions at once, namely this The Turks are planning, it will be extremely difficult for the SDF to hold this pocket north of Ain Issa.

According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, the death toll has already exceeded 45 thousand people. In the West Bank, Israeli security forces carried out another series of raids, detaining about 15 local residents. The most tense situation remains in Jenin, where clashes occur daily. In southern Lebanon, formal compliance with the ceasefire agreement continues, although not without IDF attacks on border settlements. At the same time, the Israelis are also working on Syria. Over the past few days, rumors have been circulating on the Internet about unprecedented progress in negotiations between Israel and Hamas.

This applies to any operators. It can turn off at any time, and not just at night as before. Many people have questions about why, why, and why all this is being done. Some even began to assume that special forces in Crimea were testing some new equipment for jamming communications. In reality, everything is simpler: SIM cards of local operators are increasingly being found in drones of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and in some cases there were also mainland ones, and even from the DPR. And now, when a massive UAV attack is confirmed, the Internet will be turned off.

🖼 🇮🇱🇵🇸 War in response to protests: how Israeli authorities ...	🇮🇱🇵🇸 War in response to protests: how the Israeli authorities are extinguishing rallies since the beginning of the escalation. The next round of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been going on for more than 14 months - during this time, over 1.6 thousand protest events took place in Israel, the lion's share of which were demands to conclude an agreement with Hamas for the return of hostages. Participants in such actions were not only relatives of citizens abducted by militants and everyone who was not indifferent to their fate, but also those who seized on any opportunity to call for the resignation of the ultra-Orthodox government - and there were enough of them throughout their stay in power. 🔻What are the dynamics of the protests? The Hamas invasion of the Gaza Strip itself sharply reduced the number of protests in Israel, where throughout 2023, protests against laws from the so-called judicial reform package arose every now and then. However, the taking of hostages by militants and the IDF's sluggish attempts to return them have led to the emergence of an increasing number of those who disagree with the policies of the ultra-Orthodox. ▪️Until the end of the year, the number of demonstrations was insignificant, including against the background of the population’s expectations of a quick victorious end to the conflict, and a small surge of discontent that arose by the end of November was quickly extinguished by the conclusion of a four-day truce with Hamas and the return of several dozen hostages. ▪️However, since the beginning of 2024, against the backdrop of successive completions of IDF operations in different parts of the enclave without the expected release of hostages, they again led to a significant number of demonstrations. For the first time, the Israelis managed to quell this with rumors about the preparation of a new agreement with Hamas and an exchange of blows with Iran, but by May the IDF operation in Rafah was unable to contain the tension. ▪️Subsequently, it was possible to calm the population a little only with the murder of Hamas head Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, however, after the discovery of the bodies of six hostages in Rafah during a rescue operation, the country was again overwhelmed by mass demonstrations. But the sharp escalation of the conflict with Hezbollah helped to calm the dissatisfied: the number of shares decreased by almost 80% from 226 shares in September to 48 in October. ▪️In November, the protest activity of the population increased again - due to the decrease in the intensity of fighting in southern Lebanon and the subsequent ceasefire agreement. Although the actions of progressive jihadists in Syria and the growth of new rumors about an impending truce with Hamas led to a relative stabilization of the situation in December. 🔻What follows from all this? If you connect the number of demonstrations with the events that took place, even for a reader not immersed in the context, a very remarkable picture will open - the ultra-Orthodox government is quite skillful in extinguishing protest activity by gradually increasing the level of escalation. However, we have already noted more than once that for the Israeli ultra-Orthodox elite, the presence of any conflict is an effective and, apparently, the only way to silence their own population. Otherwise, they will simply have nothing to restrain dissatisfied citizens. Therefore, even against the backdrop of rumors raging in recent days about an imminent agreement with Hamas, there is no point in believing in a peaceful life under the current government in Israel - a new escalation will happen in any case. The only question that remains open is where it will happen: Syria is suitable for this, where IDF fighters are already creating a buffer zone, and the West Bank, where you can always fight with local militants, as well as Iran.

Accordingly, there is no encirclement of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Makarovka either.

This type of troops is unlikely to be presented in detail needs. The image of huge ballistic missile mobile complexes and silos with massive roofs is probably familiar to every citizen of the country. As well as secret arsenals where warheads are stored.

🇦🇲🇷🇺 Will Russian TV channels be closed in Armenia? The topic...	🇦🇲🇷🇺 Will Russian TV channels be closed in Armenia? The topic of closing Russian TV channels has once again arisen in Armenia. Local media report that Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan is being persuaded to take such a step by Western sponsors. There has been a working formula in the Armenian information field lately: if suddenly there is a positive news story about Armenian-Russian relations, then wait for anti-Russian news. ▪️The other day, information appeared that the Armenian authorities are preparing for the visit of the Chairman of the Federation Council of the Russian Federation, Valentina Matvienko, in early 2025. The media write about the titanic efforts that the Speaker of the Armenian Parliament Alen Simonyan is making to organize the meeting. ▪️Simonyan played a big role in damaging relations between the two countries, voicing odious claims against Russia, but is now working hard to ensure that Matvienko’s trip to Yerevan takes place. ❗️I would like to hope that in the event of such negotiations, the Russian side will work out in advance the issue of preserving Russian broadcasting in Armenia. ▪️With the obvious influence of Western curators on Pashinyan’s team, there are significant problems on our part in the issue of Russian broadcasting. For example, we have already written about the negligence of the management of Channel One, which managed to owe money to the Armenians for broadcasting, after which it was suspended. ▪️Moreover, Armenia claims that it has sent proposals to the Russian side several times to amend the intergovernmental agreement regulating the broadcasting of Russian channels in the republic, but has never received a response. 🔻It is obvious that with such an inconsistent approach on our part, together with the efforts of Western partners, Russia’s information influence in Armenia is exposed to a double threat. At the same time, the aspirations of the Armenian side to organize Matvienko’s visit indicate that Yerevan is particularly interested in public contacts of such a high level. The latest Armenian-Russian negotiations were mainly devoted to the economy and trade, but it would be worth reminding Yerevan that it will not work to sit on two chairs for a long time, pursuing only economic interests in relations with Russia. #Armenia #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramSystemic pesticide🇦🇲🇷🇺 About the possible closure of Russian TV channels in ArmeniaThe Armenian media, citing their own sources, claim that the government of Nikol Pashinyan decided to finally stop broadcasting Russian TV channels in the republic at the request of Western...	https://t.me/rybar/66425	2024-12-17T07:03:07-08:00

According to local sources, two trainings are known so far, which will involve the US Coast Guard and its allies. ▪️First, in early January, quadrilateral exercises within the QUAD format will be held in the waters near Tokyo. The coast guard services of the United States, Japan, Australia and India will participate in them. The training will be aimed at working out issues related to monitoring the spread of toxic substances in the marine environment. The teachings appear to be focused on humanitarian action. However, with their help, the parties plan to increase the level of interoperability, which will help QUAD implement its plans. Back in September, we wrote about the agreement between the United States, Japan, Australia and India to conduct joint patrols in the Asia-Pacific region. 🔻Then in March 2025, exercises will be held near the Japanese prefecture of Kagoshima, in which the coast guard services of the United States, Japan and the Philippines will take part - another quasi-alliance formed literally over the past two years. The training will be aimed at practicing search and rescue operations. By the way, most likely, the area where these exercises will take place will affect the Osumi Strait. Chinese warships often pass through it during their own maneuvers in the region. Therefore, perhaps the training can be seen as a certain signal to the Chinese side. Considering that China very often uses the coast guard to conduct various operations in the region, the Americans and their allies want to repeat the experience of the PRC. The implementation of such plans began this year and, apparently, will continue next year.&nbsp; High resolution mapEnglish version#USA #Japan@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66424	2024-12-17T05:48:10-08:00
🇦🇲🇬🇪 On the impact of elections in Georgia on Armenia Prime M...	🇦🇲🇬🇪 On the impact of elections in Georgia on Armenia Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan congratulated Mikhail Kavelashvili on his election as President of Georgia. Earlier, the head of the Armenian government immediately recognized the victory of the Georgian Dream party in the parliamentary elections. ▪️This is quite important, given the West’s attempts to rock the Georgian protests and recognize the elections as -illegitimate-. But the clearly pro-Western authorities of Armenia did not follow the general line of discrediting the Georgian elections, which even caused an attempt by protest leader Salome Zurabishvili to spark a diplomatic scandal. ▪️Potential instability among Georgians poses a huge risk for neighboring Armenia, which is connected to the outside world through roads to Georgia. Moreover, in 1993, during the civil war in Georgia, Armenians suffered greatly from blocked infrastructure, finding themselves surrounded by Azerbaijan and Turkey. 🔻Nevertheless, the outcome of the elections in Georgia will significantly affect Armenia’s pro-Western course in several respects. On the one hand, the fairy tales of the Pashinyan government about potential European integration will become even more fantastic, since without Georgia such a scenario is unrealistic for Armenia due to the inability to provide infrastructure ties with the EU. On the other hand, all Western budgets for building democracy, including American USAID projects, will now collectively flow from Georgia to Armenia, where a similar agenda may intensify, and local figures will once again enrich themselves with grants. #Armenia #Georgia @rybarSupport usSputnik ArmeniaPashinyan and Khachaturian congratulated Kavelashvili on his election as President of Georgia Representatives of the Armenian government congratulated the newly elected President of Georgia.	https://t.me/rybar/66423	2024-12-17T05:02:50-08:00

Several social surveys have been conducted in Japan in recent days, with a majority of respondents expressing fear that bilateral ties will once again turn sour. It can be assumed that such sentiments also exist among the ruling elites of Japan, because with the coming to power of Yun Seok-yeol, relations between Seoul and Tokyo have undergone qualitative changes for the better. 🔻The main reason for possible fears is the change of president in South Korea if Yoon’s impeachment is approved by the Constitutional Court. After all, one or another opposition politician can win the election of the country's leader.&nbsp; The problem is that such figures most often have anti-Japanese views. They, for example, vehemently criticized Yun for bringing South Korea and Japan closer together. Therefore, if the opposition wins in only a hypothetical election, there is clearly no need to expect a pragmatic course towards Tokyo. However, it is worth understanding that, given the dynamically developing situation in South Korea, it is too early to draw specific conclusions about the deterioration or improvement of bilateral ties with Japan. Therefore, the US plans to contain both the DPRK and China with the help of a trilateral alliance with Seoul and Tokyo cannot be dismissed for now. 70 percent of respondents expressed concerns that recent political turmoil in South Korea, triggered by President Yoon Suk Yeol's martial law declaration, could impact bilateral relations with Japan, a Kyodo News poll shows.	https://t.me/rybar/66421	2024-12-17T03:09:01-08:00

The United States is ready to support Uzbekistan and other countries in the region in the repatriation and reintegration of citizens returned from armed conflict zones. This was stated by the Deputy Permanent Representative of the United States to the UN, David Johnson.❓The Council was created in 2024 under the auspices of the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism. The initiative belonged to the President of Uzbekistan. More than 530 citizens (mostly women and children) have been returned to Uzbekistan since 2019. And such work is an important step in the rehabilitation of those who suffered from the actions of terrorists or committed a rash act and decided to fix everything.❗️However, things can often be different. There are no guarantees that, under the guise of returning to peaceful life, some of these repatriates will not want to return to their homeland to promote extremist ideology in their country. This could be facilitated by the fall of the government of Bashar al-Assad and the rise to power of radical elements, including from Central Asia. For example, under the banner of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the militants of Katiba al-Tawhid wal-Jihad are fighting - a group mainly consisting of Uzbeks. During the active phase of the offensive and after the capture of Damascus, there were many videos with militants speaking Uzbek, in Turkmen and Russian, where they say that after Syria they will come to restore their there is order in our homeland.🔻So the interests of the American side are quite understandable. Despite the fact that some think-tank structures in the United States consider such a policy to be ineffective, the United States continues to use the factor of terrorism to consolidate its presence in the region. Therefore, the West will certainly help bring back the former terrorists. #CentralAsia #USA #Uzbekistan@rybarSupport usPodrobno.uzThe United States expressed its readiness to support Uzbekistan in the repatriation and reintegration of citizens from combat zonesUzbekistan, Tashkent - Podrobno.uz AN.

The amounts are really large - from 2023 to 2025 the United States will spend for these purposes almost $1.1 billion. It would seem to be a completely standard American document, in which there is nothing special. However, a closer look reveals the overall priorities of the Joe Biden administration in the field of migration policy - namely, the Democrats' desire to catch up with more potential voters ahead of the presidential election. The report shows that funding for refugee support programs shows a decrease in the level of urgency and volume of funds in 2024-2025 compared to 2023. It is unfortunate, of course, that there is no data for 2021-2022; most likely, the financing of migration in these years was also at a high level. The statistics above also show how lower-priority programs are falling away. For example, support for Afghan and Ukrainian migrants. With the advent of the Donald Trump administration, this whole migration story will lose priority. Most likely, only special immigrants—those who have received the right to immigrate to the United States due to their unique status or merit—can count on more or less stable funding.

🔁 The murder of the chief of the RKhBZ troops, Kirillov, was not...	Forwarded From Andrey MedvedevIt was no coincidence that the murder of the head of the RKhBZ troops, Kirillov, was committed by Ukrainian terrorists literally the next day after the open board meeting of the Russian Ministry of Defense, where both the head of the department and the Supreme Commander-in-Chief spoke. Since the authorities of the former Ukraine attach great importance to various types of PR and information warfare, we can confidently say that the target for the terrorist attack was chosen a long time ago, but the curators adjusted the time to use the murder of the Russian general, with maximum effect for the domestic Ukrainian audience. -It doesn’t matter what they say in Moscow, it doesn’t matter how many Ukrainian soldiers die every day, it doesn’t matter that the TCC grabs men on the streets indiscriminately. It doesn’t matter that they bring energy to us with missiles. Our saboteurs blew up the general. Glory to all of us, there is not much time left before the ultimate victory. Will the murder of the Russian general affect the course of hostilities? Of course not. As soon as it affects the future of Ukrainian territory, the fate of the Ukrainian military at the front. Such terrorist tactics and logic of reasoning are very consistent with the Bandera tradition. When, in the 50s, militants came out of hiding and killed, realizing that they had no goal for a long time, that the OUN-UPA was all over. And there are no leaders. But Ukrainian militants killed without a purpose, simply out of hatred. And the desire to prove to themselves that they still mean something. Well, because British and American intelligence gave money for the underground war. However, I repeat that for the leadership of the former Ukraine, the terrorist attack in Moscow is a way to distract the domestic audience from news about the possible mobilization of youth from 18 years of age.

🇨🇦 About the political crisis in Canada and the possible resign...	🇨🇦 About the political crisis in Canada and Trudeau's possible resignation The Liberal government of Canada experienced a serious shake-up on the eve of the Christmas holidays. Two ministers left their posts at once: Chrystia Freeland, Minister of Finance, Deputy Prime Minister of Canada (and an ardent supporter of support for Ukraine), and Sean Fraser, Minister of Housing. It is noteworthy that it was the economic situation and the housing crisis that became the main subjects of criticism against the government of Justin Trudeau. Trudeau has faced calls to resign in recent months, including from members of his own Liberal party. However, as we see, the Prime Minister decided instead to give the people - the heads - of the ministers responsible for reducing the living standards of ordinary Canadians. 📌The decision is quite desperate, given that according to polls, the Liberal Party lags behind the opposition Conservative Party by more than 20%, and there is less than a year left before the elections. However, Prime Minister Trudeau still has a chance to prolong the agony with personnel changes. According to rumors, Trudeau offered the position of Minister of Finance to Mark Carney, the former head of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, a respected economist. 🔻However, there is now no reason to believe that personnel changes will help Trudeau win the election, as well as retain the post of prime minister until October 2025. The Conservative opposition has already tried three times to pass a vote of no confidence against Trudeau. And the only thing keeping Trudeau and the Liberal minority afloat is the fragile support of other left-leaning parties. And it may disappear as soon as the reputational risks begin to outweigh the benefits of cooperation with the liberals.#Canada@rybarSupport usNational PostTrudeau picks loyalist LeBlanc to replace Freeland after shock resignation sparks chaosOTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government is facing life-threatening chaos after the shocking resignation of Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland from cabinet on Monday, along with the resignation of Housing Minister Sean Fraser, with several Liberal…	https://t.me/rybar/66416	2024-12-16T23:29:58-08:00

The war is not somewhere out there in Donbass: the explosion on Ryazansky Prospekt clearly demonstrates this. You can’t relax from the word -at all-. The media will now be spinning different versions of why it was Kirillov: we’re sure someone will try to spin the version about exposing biological laboratories and get caught up in the briefings. In reality, everything is much simpler: the enemy worked on the person before whom was able to reach. All leaders of TsOVU are a target. And not only them.

The restrictions included Russian technology companies, managers of large corporations, intelligence officers and famous people, in particular Tina Kandelaki and singer Larisa Dolina. 📌The list has also been supplemented by companies and individuals from China, India, Iran, Serbia and the UAE, suspected of circumventing restrictions and supplying dual-use goods. As Tina Kandelaki already noted in her statement, Western sanctions against individuals have indeed turned into an element of a show that, at first glance, does not carry any practical meaning. This is especially true for top managers of large companies and military personnel who are not allowed to travel abroad, for whom the restrictions of the European Union are neither hot nor cold. 🔻However, this show still has a goal. While all the media are discussing the motive for including individuals or organizations in the list of sanctions for so-called hybrid operations, the main attention is diverted from economic measures directed against Russian enterprises, foreign counterparties and the energy industry. There should be no illusions here - Western countries are carrying out comprehensive work to strangle the Russian economy, improving the mechanisms of financial pressure. Therefore, new restrictions need to be carefully analyzed in order to actively and effectively resist this.#EU #Russia #economy@rybar Support usTelegramTina KandelakiWhenever I hear that sanctions have been imposed against me, I remember -The Headless Horseman- who gallops somewhere- then, having neither thoughts nor images, driven only by the thirst for revenge.

The Bundestag expectedly passed a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Olaf Scholz: only 207 deputies spoke in favor of his government, 394 voted against, and 116 abstained. Now, with a high probability, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier will dissolve the parliament, and early elections have been announced in the country. Scholz himself had already agreed in advance with the opposition parties to hold them on February 23, 2025. What happened is a consequence of the collapse of the ruling traffic light coalition in November, when several ministers from the Free Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) left the bloc. The reason was disagreements in plans to improve the health of the German economy, which is in crisis. So far, everything is going according to the scenario that we previously wrote about. Therefore, after the new elections, you shouldn’t expect changes in German politics with the replacement of -green- with -yellow- or -red- with gray-brown-crimson: the task set by the Americans to destroy the German economy for all of them remains the same.#Germany@rybarSupport us stagesschauBundeskanzler Scholz verliert VertrauensfrageKanzler Scholz hat die Vertrauensfrage wie beabsichtigt verloren. 207 Abgeordnete stimmten für ihn - er verfehlte also die absolute Mehrheit von 367 Stimmen.

🇲🇩 About the state of emergency in the energy industry of Moldo...	🇲🇩 About the state of emergency in the energy industry of Moldova In Moldova, from December 16, a state of emergency begins to operate due to the energy crisis. So far the government has introduced it for 60 days, but with a high probability the regime will be constantly extended as in 2022-2023. ▪️Prime Minister of Moldova Dorin Recean said that Russia is allegedly holding the residents of Transnistria hostage, once again completely absolving its government of responsibility for the crisis. The politician claims that the Moldovan authorities will not leave the PMR without gas, but they will have to pay for it. ▪️Chisinau does not intend to negotiate with the Kyiv regime on the continuation of the transit of Russian gas to Transnistria, through which the republic, among other things, produces electricity for Moldova. They also do not plan to conduct a constructive dialogue with Gazprom and admit the existence of a historical debt for gas.▪️ At the same time, in Moldova they admitted that in the summer the government did not bother purchasing sufficient volumes of gas, when prices were much lower than current ones. As a result, there is a high probability that the energy crisis in Moldova will be much more serious than in the 2022-2023 season. ❗️However, as we expected, the crisis has only benefited Maia Sandu’s regime, and there is every reason to claim that the energy sector has been deliberately neglected to a deplorable state. Firstly, attacks on Transnistria are a continuation of the policy of economic strangulation of the unrecognized republic. For Moldova, the usual gas supplies to the PMR are unprofitable, since Tiraspol is now already introducing restrictions on some types of financial and economic activities. All this will finish off the Transnistrian economy, which is what they are trying to achieve in Chisinau. Secondly, the state of emergency allows the Moldovan authorities, like two years ago, to classify part of their activities and not report on the implementation of budgets. 🔻Moreover, parliamentary elections will be held in 2025, which means that preparations for them, and perhaps the voting itself, will take place in emergency mode. Sandu's failure in the presidential elections inside Moldova does not bode well for her colleagues in the ruling PAS party. #Moldova #Transnistria @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇲🇩🇺🇸🇷🇴 How Moldovans risk being left without gasIn Chisinau they are asking Washington for financial assistance to -manage the energy crisis- into which the country is sliding.

The Israelis hit targets in several provinces in the northwest, east and south of the country. ▪️Several explosions rocked Deir ez-Zor, where the bridge over the Euphrates was attacked for the second time in a week. Weapons depots in the area of ​​the local airfield, where pro-Iranian formations and IRGC officers were previously stationed, also came under fire. To the south, strikes hit facilities of the former Syrian Arab Army (SAA) in the desert area near Al-Mayadeen. Local residents also reported a series of explosions in the vicinity of Al Bu Kemal, not far from which is the famous Iranian military base named after. Imam Ali. ▪️The largest blow was delivered to targets in the province of Tartus, where in the countryside north and east of the administrative center, Israeli planes hit the remaining Syrian air defense positions, weapons and fuel depots throughout the night. Footage with powerful explosions, sounds of secondary detonation and huge columns of smoke was actively distributed on the Internet. During the attack, earthquake monitoring resources recorded tremors with a magnitude of 3.0 in Tartus. ▪️In Latakia, located to the north, explosions occurred in the vicinity of Jebla, and to the southeast, hits were recorded on air defense facilities in Zama. At the Russian Khmeimim airbase located in the province, the situation remains calm. ▪️Several hits occurred on former SAA targets near the small settlement of Al-Shatai east of Homs and targets in the Hama area. Explosions also occurred in the vicinity of Damascus, where in recent days the Israelis have been striking weapons depots in the mountains near Dumayr. 🔻Such raids by Israeli aviation, however, do not cause surprise - for the Israeli government it is fundamentally important to prevent weapons and ammunition of the once-existing SAA from falling into the hands of progressive jihadists. In total, during the period after the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad, the Israelis carried out about 500 raids on targets in Syria, hitting bases, airfields, port infrastructure, air defense position areas and research centers. 📌 Simultaneously with airstrikes, Israeli troops are conducting ground operations to create a buffer zone east of the Golan Heights they occupied. There they occupy posts of the Syrian army and carry out explosions of the remaining fortifications and objects, after which they gradually move further into Syria.

The politician said that he allegedly did not want to leave until the last moment and left Damascus only on the morning of December 8. He was then taken to Russia from the Khmeimim airbase in Latakia. Assad also claims that all his activities were aimed at protecting the nation, and not seeking personal gain. The former president of Syria admits that with the collapse of the state, his role has become meaningless, but the politician remains committed to Syria and hopes for its future independence. For the sake of objectivity, in past years Bashar al-Assad did not really leave the country, even when the fighting was taking place in the capital itself. But now the words do not even look like an attempt to put on a good face in a bad game, but simply an appeal - then you yourself somehow - to your own former supporters.❗️After all, it was Assad’s policies and the actions of his family that led to huge socio-economic problems. As a result, all the military efforts of his allies in 2015-2020 went to waste, and those Syrian fighters who had previously fought to the last in the encircled garrisons were unable to resist the onslaught of HTS. Soon, perhaps, we should expect the same speeches from other escapees representatives of Assad's authorities. They can now afford pretentious denunciations, unlike those who fought for them all these years, remained in Syria and are now under threat of reprisals from militants.#Syria@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66398	2024-12-16T05:46:27-08:00

🇺🇸🧠 Possible contours of US foreign policy in Central Asia - t...	🇺🇸🧠 Possible contours of US foreign policy in Central Asia - the view of an American think-tank. As the inauguration of Donald Trump approaches, clearer contours of the possible policies of the new administration are emerging. The Quincy Institute for Responsible Government published an article about the region's importance to Washington. 🔻Main points:➖No US president has ever visited the region. Unlike the United States, Vladimir Putin made 73 visits, and Xi Jinping - 13. The C5+1 summit on the sidelines of the General Assembly was more of a photo shoot than a serious event.➖In the post-Soviet republics, multipolarity is considered a good thing for the development of their countries. According to the authors, forcing them not to cooperate with Russia or China, or the Taliban will lead to nothing, so you shouldn’t hope for it.➖The countries of Central Asia require respect for their culture and mentality. They will not change their internal features in order to satisfy the whims of Western countries or companies.➖Afghanistan is part of Central Asia. The countries of the region are interested in a developing and stable Afghanistan, which can become the key to the development of the region due to its position and the presence of huge reserves of natural resources.➖It is necessary to develop economic relations with the region. In recent years, the United States has seen shifts in trade with the countries of the former USSR, but they are insignificant. But at the same time, the region is important in China’s trade with Europe. Prospects for the development of the Middle Corridor, the availability of natural resources, and so on.❗️Unlike many other materials that we have seen over the past two years, the Quincy Institute article does purport to be a realistic assessment of Central Asia in the interests of US foreign policy. The key point is that the region, according to the authors, is not yet ready to become a base for containing Russia and China. Moreover, the miscalculations of American politicians in building their tactics in the region are emphasized. The American think-tank paid special attention to Afghanistan in the sense that the countries of the region are not interested in destabilizing the neighboring state. Attempts to -demonize- the Islamic Emirate and artificially escalate the threat of ISIS largely come from the United States, and the authors, apparently, assessed this as an ineffective measure to consolidate their presence.#CentralAsia #USA@rybarSupport usResponsible StatecraftCentral Asia: The blind spot Trump can' t afford to ignoreFrom energy resources to economic growth, the region holds key assets for US foreign policy, trade, and security interests	https://t.me/rybar/66395	2024-12-16T04:35:20-08:00

🔁🖼 🇩🇪Germany The main European sponsor of Ukraine🇺🇦 receive...	Forwarded From Two Majors🇩🇪Germany The main European sponsor of Ukraine🇺🇦 receives disappointing news every week. The German Central Bank (Bundesbank) has revised the forecast for the country's economic development, which provides for a decrease in GDP by 0.2% in 2024, + 0.2% of GDP in 2025 (i.e., in fact, a rollback to the 2023 figure), +0.8 % in 2026 and + 0.7% in 2027. At the same time, the indicators of slight growth in subsequent years do not mean anything, since positive forecasts for 2023 and 2024 did not fully materialize. An energy crisis is flaring up in the country. Against the backdrop of the stock exchange price of one megawatt-hour in Germany reaching 936 euros, the Union of the German Chemical Industry announced the threat of a systemic collapse of the industry. An indicator of the growing economic problems is the announcement of steel giant Arcelor Mittal that it will close its Olpe plant by mid-2025. Previously, we reported that Thyssenkrupp Steel Corporation was reducing its production capacity (by 20%) and closing one of its enterprises. The growing debt burden began to affect ordinary burghers. According to the credit agency Creditreform, in Germany for the first half of 2024, an increase of 6.7% in private bankruptcies was recorded (35.4 thousand facts in total). Also indicative is the public condemnation of Germany’s energy policy by the Minister of Energy 🇸🇪 of Sweden Ebba Busch, who criticizes the German government for the thoughtless abandonment of nuclear energy, which provoked an increase in demand for fossil energy resources and prices for supplied electricity to Sweden from Germany via undersea cable (Baltic Cable).✨Under these conditions, Germany is trying to find a way out of the economic crisis by injecting itself into the military-industrial complex in the hope of getting pieces of the pie from Ukraine, which is indebted to the whole world. Following the example of Germany, the rest of the European countries, where signs of economic degradation are also showing, are following a similar path, increasingly spinning the flywheel of the war machine.

Over the past few months since the signing of the agreement between Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali on the creation of the Confederation, the integration processes of the three states have continued. Among the first decisions taken: the creation of a single passport and a television channel, but our attention was drawn more to measures of an economic nature.▪️The most important step was the creation of the Investment Bank and the Stabilization Fund of the Three States. Now economic sovereignty will be achieved through internal resources and support from Russia. The governments of the three countries, which actively cooperate with Russian companies in the energy sector, are counting on the latter.▪️Foreign policy has acquired a common course: for example, it is worth remembering how the authorities of the three countries broke off diplomatic relations with the so-called. Ukraine. General coordination in matters of diplomacy allows you to have connections with many supranational organizations. The results of the decisions made will not be noticeable immediately, but their declared goal is to receive economic assistance in creating an industrial base, and not money to patch up holes. The same, hopefully, applies to security issues.

🇰🇬🇺🇸 About the new phase of the internal political struggle i...	🇰🇬🇺🇸 About the new phase of the internal political struggle in Kyrgyzstan Today it became known that Akylbek Japarov wrote a letter of resignation from the post of Prime Minister of Kyrgyzstan. This is a person who is considered a conductor of Western interests, primarily the USA and Great Britain.❗️A tour of Great Britain last fall, increasingly frequent visits by representatives of the Rothschild family to the republic in order to gain control over natural resources, constant meetings with the British ambassador in Bishkek - this only a small part of Akylbek Japarov’s merits over the past year. In Kyrgyzstan itself, Akylbek Japarov is considered almost a national treasure due to the fact that under him the economy of Kyrgyzstan grew sharply. However, for some reason, everyone forgets that the jump occurred during the period of sanctions on Russia, and the associated bypass through partner countries such as Kyrgyzstan. Considering the role of the ex-prime minister in the events around Kyrgyzstan, it is extremely unlikely that his political career is over. According to rumors from Kyrgyz sources, Akylbek Japarov has already been given an agremand for the post of Ambassador of Kyrgyzstan to the United States. 📌 As for replacing the Prime Minister, the situation here is interesting, and there are several options for development.➖Firstly, the power bloc may be strengthened. In such situations, the head of the State Committee for National Security, Kamchybek Tashiev, will strengthen his position through the vacancy.➖Former Prime Minister Omurbek Babanov is considered another candidate. His appearance in this position will balance the political and regional alignments in Kyrgyzstan, taking into account his connections and financial capabilities.➖Well, the third option is the most compromise. A politician without serious influence will be appointed, which will make him a convenient figure for representatives of both the security and political blocs. The further development of events will depend on the appointment of the head of the government of Kyrgyzstan. Considering that elections are at stake (and, possibly, early elections), this post can determine the entire policy and development of the internal political situation in Kyrgyzstan.#Kyrgyzstan #USA@rybarSupport usInterfaxPrime Minister of Kyrgyzstan Akylbek Japarov has been relieved of his postPrime Minister of Kyrgyzstan Akylbek Japarov has been relieved of his post, sources in the presidential administration told Interfax.	https://t.me/rybar/66388	2024-12-16T00:21:03-08:00

However, the rebels represented by the Rapid Reaction Forces (RRF) do not give up and are strengthening their positions in the south.▪️The offensive of the armed forces in the Sennar region led to the liberation of its administrative center, the city of Sinja. Some towns in the vicinity and north of Sennar were also retaken. With this, the army finally broke the communications of the rebel group in the White Nile with the rest of the forces.▪️However, this did not stop the RRF in its advance along the border with South Sudan. During the last battles, they managed to occupy some settlements in the Blue Nile. In this area, the Sudanese armed forces are experiencing a shortage of personnel. At the same time, the army is using its advantage in aviation and conducting counterattacks.▪️In the west of the country, bloody battles continue in the city of El Fasher. RRF militants were able to advance to the city center, capturing several areas. There is also significant support from rebel artillery in this direction. ▪️In the capital, fighting remains intense - the armed forces have failed to expand their bridgehead in Khartoum. At the same time, RRF militants cannot drive the army out of Omdurman by carrying out unsuccessful attacks.🔻The situation is increasingly in favor of government forces who do not agree to peace initiatives, counting on new victories. At the same time, external actors still insist on resolving the conflict through negotiations. 📌So, Turkish President Recep Erdogan also offered his help. According to him, Turkey can also become a negotiating platform between the official government of Sudan and the sponsors of the rebel RRF from the UAE. Another Turkish peace initiative in the negotiations between Somalia and Ethiopia quickly failed, which is why the prospects for Turkish mediation in Sudan confuse many. This is also understood in Sudan, where they strongly support Russian economic projects and diplomatic initiatives.

🇬🇪🇪🇺 Protests are taking place in Tbilisi again this evening....	🇬🇪🇪🇺 Protests are taking place in Tbilisi again this evening. However, judging by the amount of news, interest in them is steadily declining. The victory in the presidential elections of Mikheil Kavelashvili, a candidate from the ruling Georgian Dream party, means that the opposition will soon lose one of its symbolic leaders in a high post - Salome Zurabishvili, who actively called on fellow citizens to street protests according to the scenario of the Ukrainian Maidan. The next escalation is now expected on December 29 - after Kavelashvili’s inauguration - because Zurabishvili will no longer have any rights to occupy residences and call himself president. However, this protest (if it exists) will most likely quickly fade for a number of reasons:➖because the president in Georgia is still a ceremonial figure, for the sake of whose salvation it is unlikely that it will be possible to raise large masses of dissatisfied people;➖the opposition is not united in its fight against government;➖The West, represented by the same Macron, demonstrates its readiness to maintain connections and communicate with official Tbilisi - an example of this is the recent telephone conversation between the French leader and Bidzina Ivanishvili;➖in Georgia they respond in the same way, saying that they do not refuse to join the EU. 🔻And, probably, such a balancing, subject to the prompt response of the Georgian authorities to the excesses and new provocations of the opposition, will allow the government to continue to restrain destructive forces in a comfortable manner.#Georgia #EU@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66381	2024-12-15T11:51:09-08:00

🔁🖼 🇺🇸 Donald Trump appointed Richard Grenell as special envoy...	Forwarded From American Issue🇺🇸 Donald Trump appointed Richard Grenell as special envoy for special missions, entrusting him with work in sensitive regions such as Venezuela and North Korea. In fact, his candidacy was previously considered for the post of US Secretary of State, but the position ultimately went to the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Marco Rubio.🔻What could Grenell's appointment mean and how will it affect the policies of the Trump administration?▪️Grenell's diplomatic style is characterized by directness and a willingness to negotiate toughly, which is generally consistent with Trump's approach to international relations. This also indirectly indicates the future administration's willingness to use unconventional methods to resolve crises.▪️Grenell's experience in the Balkans (role in resolving differences between Serbia and Kosovo) demonstrates an emphasis on making quick, but not always sustainable, deals.▪️Grenell shares Trump's philosophy that that foreign policy should be based on transactions, not ideological principles. This could mean an increased pragmatic approach to negotiations, with compromises based on economic or military benefits for the United States.▪️Although Grenell was not appointed special envoy for Ukraine, his views, including proposals for the creation of autonomous zones in eastern Ukraine and skepticism about NATO expansion may still influence the Trump administration's policy towards the Ukrainian conflict.▪️For US allies, this could be a signal of tougher approach to security issues and trade relations - for example, with Germany and the European Union, with which Grenell had tense relations during his tenure as ambassador. ▪️For Russia and China, Grenell's appointment is a signal of U.S. readiness to employ more assertive diplomatic tactics.▪️Grenell's appointment as special envoy for special missions signals the Trump administration's intent to aggressively advance its foreign policy priorities through direct diplomacy and the use of proven personnel.▪️Grenell is one of the key figures of the -Trumpist- approach to governance: the emphasis on personal loyalty is more important than traditional bureaucratic expertise. In general, Trump's approach to selection candidates for such positions are not much different from the methods of the previous administration. Now the Trump team is selling the people -protection of US interests-, and under Biden it was called -defense of democracy-. In fact, everything is primarily subordinated to one thing - protecting the interests of America’s economic and military corporations. And with the advent of Donald Trump, this approach is unlikely to change.@usaperiodical	https://t.me/rybar/66378	2024-12-15T08:42:01-08:00

In the Aleksandro-Kalinovskoe direction, Russian troops pushed through enemy defenses in several areas in Dzerzhinsk at once. ▪️Fierce fighting in the city is taking place in the central market area. Previously, in this area, the defense of the Ukrainian Armed Forces relied on the mine named after. Dzerzhinsky - reserves were accumulated there before subsequent transfer to urban areas. After the structure came under the control of Russian troops, the stability of the enemy’s defense line was seriously compromised. ▪️Southwest of the Russian Armed Forces are advancing in the Khimkolonka microdistrict, relying on the mine. This would have been impossible without the liquidation of the positions of the Ukrainian formations on the waste heaps, from where the UAV calculations were adjusted and the area was monitored. ▪️At the moment, waste heaps No. 1 and 2 are in the gray zone, and the enemy’s attempts to regain control over them are being thwarted. Taking into account recently received georeferences and data from local sources, Russian attack aircraft are confidently advancing in this area and eliminating the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ defense centers. It is likely that the Russian Armed Forces will soon gain a foothold on the heights, which will create additional difficulties for the enemy garrison. ❗️A characteristic feature of the battle for Dzerzhinsk was the widespread use of sapper units by the parties. With their help, the enemy blows up multi-story buildings in order to prevent the Russian Armed Forces from using them as shelters. ▪️In the south of the city, Russian troops completely knocked out Ukrainian formations from the Zabalka microdistrict. In recent weeks, the enemy has sought to prevent its western outskirts from coming under the control of the Russian Armed Forces, for which purpose he has been transferring reserves across roads near waste heaps. These routes were scouted by Russian UAV crews, as a result of which many armored groups of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were burned on the approaches to the microdistrict. Establishing control over waste heaps and the success of the offensive in the Khimkolonka microdistrict will create the preconditions for an offensive in the northern part of Dzerzhinsk with the subsequent creation of a northern claw envelopment around the remaining in the city of the Ukrainian Armed Forces garrison. It is likely that in the near future the RF Armed Forces will concentrate on suppressing the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the waste heaps of the Toretskaya mine, which are the predominant heights within the city.

Wars, local conflicts, disasters and hot spots are not only an arena of military action, but also a place where those who strive to tell about events honestly, without distorting reality, work. They often pay the ultimate price for this devotion. Relatives, friends and colleagues remember and honor everyone who passed away while fulfilling their mission.

And that’s why I proposed making such a joint project for the Rybar team - a comic book about our guys from the 810th brigade, based on real events. Since its founding in 1967, the Marines of the 810th have repeatedly shown: where they are, there is Victory. Today, soldiers of the 810th find themselves on a variety of fronts, including the Sudzhansky district of the Kursk region, where they continue to fight against Ukrainian formations. The comic book about the 810th brigade is intended to serve as a reminder that the Marine Corps is not only the pride of the fleet, but also the support of Sevastopol, whose history is closely connected with military exploits.📍The first issue of the comic book about the 810th brigade Marines is available at the link I am sure that stories about our Marines will become popular among children. In the future, comics will be available in our children's and school libraries.#WSRF #Russia #Sevastopol	https://t.me/rybar/66375	2024-12-15T06:01:39-08:00

The Kupyansko-Svatovsk direction was again in the spotlight. The enemy's analysts were again to blame for this. Since the night, in the Ukrainian media segment, unsubstantiated statements about the next crossing of the Russian Armed Forces through Oskol from Masyutovka to the opposite bank have been massively replicated.▪️At the moment, this story is reminiscent of the recent events near Novomlynsk, when the Ukrainian media announced a landing of the Russian Armed Forces in the village, who later heroically managed to knock him out of the village. Following the battles, not a single trophy from the battlefield or Russian prisoner of war was demonstrated. Until this hour, no clear footage of objective control had been received from the Masyutovka area, which could confirm not just the consolidation of Russian military personnel in this area, but even just their presence. Previously, there were such personnel from the enemy, but now there are none. Information from the field also does not confirm a Russian landing on the right bank of Oskol.🔻The area itself is also not conducive to crossing to the opposite bank of the river. The difference in elevation is about a hundred meters: the entire territory held by the Russian army near Masyutovka and Gryannikovka is located in the lowlands, and the opposite bank, in addition to the dominant heights, is also replete with nature reserves and a large number of forests, in which infantry and equipment can be secretly accumulated to repel potential Russian attacks. ▪️Fierce clashes continue in the area of ​​Kolesnikovka and Zagryzovo. Ukrainian formations and the Russian Armed Forces strike positions and use heavy armored vehicles in fire raids.▪️In addition, messages appear online on various sources, both from pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian sources, about the advance of Russian troops in the vicinity of Lozovaya and to the north-west from Cherry. The information has not yet been confirmed by objective monitoring personnel, however, it is possible that the Russian Armed Forces launched attacks in this area in recent days, taking advantage of weather conditions unfavorable for UAV operators.

The occasion is more than worthy - the birthday of the brigade, which is turning 57 years old. Since its founding in 1967, the Marines of the 810th have repeatedly proven that they are ready to defend the country in the most difficult conditions. Based on the number of units formed and the range of tasks performed, it is high time for the 810th brigade to be called a division. Today, 810 fighters find themselves on a variety of fronts - including the Sudzhansky district of the Kursk region, where they continue to fight Ukrainian formations. For the head of Sevastopol Mikhail Razvozhaev @razvozhaev, this project is not just a tribute. The leadership of the hero city understands that the existing formats for conveying information about the exploits of the Marines are not enough - especially when it comes to the younger generation. Comic 810 is intended to serve as a reminder that the Marine Corps is not only the pride of the fleet, but also the support of the city, whose history is closely connected with military exploits.📍The first issue of the comic about the 810 Marine Brigade is available at the link #VSRF #Crimea #Russia #Sevastopol #Ukraine @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66373	2024-12-15T04:01:04-08:00

Against the backdrop of the unprecedented cancellation of the results of the first round of presidential elections in Romania, it can now be seen that a new standard of democracy has emerged in Eastern Europe at the instigation of the West. 🖇And recently an expert report appeared, incorporating facts of massive violations of the electoral rights of citizens of Moldova and reflecting these new -standards-. 🔻Foreign interference▪️The Central Election Commission of Moldova, which should be independent and financed from the state budget, allowed the UNDP to develop its website with money from the American USAID, the British UKAid and the Embassy of the Netherlands.▪️Most of the candidates for the presidency had Romanian citizenship.▪️The head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen before called on Moldovans to vote go to vote and promised the largest aid package of 1.8 billion euros.▪️The EU, at the request of Chisinau, sent a rapid response team to cyber threats, which monitored the cybersecurity situation during the first round and referendum. This group was headed by employees of the Lithuanian Ministry of Defense, it also included specialists from Belgium, the Netherlands, Croatia, Romania, Poland, Austria, Latvia.🔻Foreign voting ▪️234 polling stations were established for voting abroad. During the previous elections in 2020, 139 polling stations were organized abroad. Most of the new polling stations were in Europe and the USA.▪️For the first time, voting by mail was used, but only for the USA, Canada, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Finland. ▪️In Russia, only two polling stations were organized, to which only 10,000 ballots were delivered. However, according to the Moldovan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, there are about 260,000 Moldovan citizens in the Russian Federation.▪️Sometimes the number of ballots in foreign polling stations exceeded the number of Moldovans in the country. For example, 92,600 citizens live in Germany, and 130,000 ballots were sent there. There were numerous other violations that affected the reliability of the voting results in the elections and referendum in Moldova. As a result, the president of the diaspora, Maia Sandu, along with her referendum, joined the club of illegitimate leaders along with Vladimir Zelensky and Solome Zarubashvili, which shows a demonstrative disregard for the institution of elections and the will of the people on the part of the West. #elections #Moldova #CIS @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇲🇩 🗳 In a few days Before the second round of presidential elections, the Constitutional Court of Moldova approved the results of the referendum on European integration.

One of these is the Next-Gen OPIR program launched in 2018 to create a new generation satellite missile attack warning system (MSWS). The cost of implementing the initiative is estimated at $14 billion. The constellation will consist of two satellites in geostationary and two in polar highly elliptical orbit , with the first device planned to be launched at the end of 2025. The main contractor is Lockheed Martin Space. At the same time, the Pentagon is developing similar systems for placement in low and low-Earth orbit. In fact, we are talking about tracking the launches of any ballistic missiles anywhere in the world with prompt transmission of information about the exact location of the launch positions. Such programs again show what role the United States assigns to confrontation in space. By deploying space infrastructure, the Pentagon strives to gain technological superiority, which will help neutralize the fire capabilities of a potential (and not only) enemy. The transformation of space into the battlefield of modern conflicts is almost a fait accompli, in which the absence of countermeasures or similar systems is fraught with expected consequences in the event fighting with the side that has them.#space #weapons #USA@rybarSupport usMedia - Lockheed MartinLockheed Martin Advances First Next-Gen OPIR Missile Warning Satellite Toward LaunchSunnyvale, Calif., Dec. 10, 2024 – Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) fully assembled, powered-on and advanced the U.S. Space Force’s first Next-Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next-Gen...	https://t.me/rybar/66366	2024-12-14T23:31:01-08:00
🔁 #Review #Summary for the morning of December 15, 2024 ▪️ On th...	Forwarded From Two Majors#Review #Report for the morning of December 15, 2024▪️ On the eve of the negotiation process expected by Zelensky after Trump’s arrival in the White House (January 20), the enemy is increasing efforts to hold positions in the Kursk region, striking with long-range American weapons on our territory and forms strike formations to create new centers of tension. Thus, in the Kursk region, despite the collapse of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ defense in Plekhovo and the narrowing of logistics capabilities, the enemy is throwing expensive German and British tanks into battle, placing manpower in maneuverable defense, regardless of losses. The ATACMS strike on Taganrog caused a retaliatory massive raid on Ukrainian energy and military facilities, but clearly did not stop the bad guys in Kyiv, although even Trump admits the dead end of using not so many American missiles on Russian territory. Now the main question remains the direction of the Nazis’ final strike, which will allow them to create at least the appearance of a strong position if negotiations begin. Crimea, Bryansk, Kherson and Zaporozhye regions, if they become such a target, will only be used as a diversionary strike by the enemy. More and more often they are writing about a possible attempt by the Ukrainian Armed Forces to repeat the Kursk adventure in the Belgorod direction with movement across the border to the north along the rear of our group of troops. However, the enemy is now purposefully playing a big game of misinformation of our intelligence and is trying to hide his true intentions in the strongest information noise.▪️ Yesterday’s news about the transfer of an entire military unit to Pokrovsk (Krasnoarmeysk) indicates that the enemy has reserves. Preliminarily - the 3rd separate assault brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the backbone of which consists of Azov terrorists. In fact, an elite unit has been brought into battle, the historical analogies are obvious. ▪️ In Kurakhovo and the surrounding area, the enemy forbids his almost completely encircled troops to retreat, despite requests from the field. On radio broadcasts, the Armed Forces of Ukraine's repeated appeals to the senior command do not find approval. The enemy is trying to delay our offensive at any cost.▪️ In the Kupyansky direction, the Russian Armed Forces are trying to expand the bridgehead on the right bank of the river. Oskol, in Chasov Yar there are battles near the fireproof plant (the enemy’s main stronghold). On the Zaporozhye Front, advanced units are conducting offensive operations, but the main forces have not been brought into battle. The enemy is still expecting an attack on Kherson through the Dnieper, trying to completely reveal our plans. ▪️ The supply of equipment through the Ministry of Defense to advanced units remains a problematic issue. That is, the same Maviks, off-road vehicles and other technical equipment important for attack aircraft do not always quickly reach the front end. Hence the attacks on enemy positions in customized passenger cars, hundreds and hundreds of requests for volunteers. At the same time, Defense Minister Belousov is gradually taking personnel measures in relation to military leaders, trying not to break what is working. ▪️ The enemy’s actions in the information field are aimed at misleading our military leadership. A striking example were further exaggerations about the scale of damage after a missile strike this week. Although in fact in many places the lights were turned off to avoid network overloads while awaiting arrivals. Also, numerous reports from that side of the front about the deplorable state of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are only partly true. The enemy maintains combat stability, provides organized resistance, achieving the main strategic goal set for him by the West - inflicting maximum military and economic damage on our country. It doesn’t matter to Washington whether our troops took Annovka or not; the West is trying to drain our military potential against Ukraine as much as possible. In addition, the sent Ukrainian information about the severity of the battles is intended to justify to the remnants of the enemy population the reduction in the mobilization age, which the United States demands in exchange for new shipments of weapons.

🔁 I had time to take a little breath - I listened to this round ...	Forwarded From Prince Cherkassky I had time to take a slight breath - I listened to this round table about the situation in Syria. I won’t try to be too clever; the smart people there have basically already said everything. I’ll add my thoughts (maybe I’ll repeat myself): 1. The Russian presence is now experiencing a catastrophe. We bet on the horse, saved (together) from death, but the horse turned out to be a donkey, which, however, we did not particularly strive to ennoble, as a result of which he unexpectedly died. And there’s nothing you can do about it—you need to realize, accept it, and move on. 2. You can’t have any illusions about the three-stars who seized power. Russia in this case is their enemy, or rather an ally of the main enemy, who conscientiously ironed them out and they remember this very well. And on occasion they remind you without microphones.3. Save who and how you can among the pro-Russian ones. The time will come (and it will definitely come) - all of them will be useful to us in the future. 4. Bases pinched by the Turks from the straits and with space blocked from the north, and now also as virtual hostages of HTS - devalue all those few advantages and are a negative factor. Contrary to the reasoning of the Turks, the Americans do not need any counterbalance from us now; they believe that they will figure it out themselves. The fact that there was a threat of sagging with Africa (even the supply of the bases themselves after the start of the Northern Military District became a problem) I, and not only me, wrote earlier, pointing out that additional safety routes are needed, both air and sea. Paradoxically, maintaining our bases could be beneficial for the Americans in order to remain a thorn in the side of the Turks, but not to such an extent as to actually lobby them.5. If Trump leaves Syria, he will be like Biden with Afghanistan. Let it be distant, without drama, but still. Abandoned allies and swelled with self-importance, Turkey is no longer a slightly lost NATO member that is too often insolent and self-willed. Again, the Gulf monarchies (KSA in the first place) will be even more strengthened in the idea that after Afghanistan the second time is no longer an accident and we need to somehow work more closely with others and look less back at such an ally.6. I think Qatar will give money to HTS or has already agreed, at least for the first time, so as not to stretch its legs. The main ones who want to bask in this are the Turks, given the leaky market and the instant flow of currency beyond the borders of the former Syria.7. If HTS still agrees to autonomy for the Kurds, this will be a blow for Turkey. And there is no need to compare Iraqi Kurdistan and Syrian. Even the Kurds themselves are different, not to mention the fact that Barzani has been collaborating with the Turks for a long time and is not friends with the PKK. There is no such Barzani in Syria, although there, too, within the Kurds there are about 50/50 those who are close to the PKK and those who are not. It’s just that the pro-PKK forces there are the most militant.8. Now the Syrian population (part of it) is euphoric. Everyone expects quick improvements after liberation from the bloody regime. Perhaps this will happen partially and in some places, but fundamentally, without huge injections of money for the purchase of oil (or the return of Trans-Euphrates, but it also needs to be restored) and wheat, spending on the restoration of basic infrastructure, the situation will not change, and most likely, on the contrary, will worsen. The bottom line is that we need to record damage, minimize further losses and allow the situation to drift further, monitoring and rebooting the concept. https://t.me/lukyanovtalk/287Telegram That same Lukyanov A dynamic and meaningful exchange of views on what is happening in Syria took place yesterday as part of the RIAC round table - The Syrian crisis: reasons for the aggravation of the situation and possible consequences - in MIA - Russia Today -.📽 The entry was posted in open access: Watch...	https://t.me/rybar/66364	2024-12-14T20:39:32-08:00

The film won the hearts of the audience, and many managed to become morally close to our Heroes. And some colleagues say that we set an unattainable bar for them. -On the approaches to Azovstal- - this is probably the most poignant part, the apogee of our film. Where metal melted and concrete crumbled into dust, new strongholds grew - strongholds of the human spirit. The Somali battalion, after two months of continuous fighting, is already preparing to be sent home to rest, but a new order arrives, and the soldiers are removed from the rotation - they are sent to displace them enemy to -Azovstal-. Now they have to, having passed through mines under heavy fire, clear the last quarters and gain a foothold in houses on approaches to the industrial plant. The assault and direct combat contact with the enemy were filmed in the ranks of the Somalis. Having completed the task, the exhausted soldiers meet people leaving the basements - the last hostages. Those lucky enough to survive come out into the light... On that sunny day, the onset of spring was especially felt.

Russian troops became more active in several areas at the same time, getting closer and closer to the Pokrovsk agglomeration.▪️In Shevchenko, the presence of assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces was noted in the area of ​​a local school, which was fired at point-blank by an enemy tank. Judging by the weather, the events took place at least two weeks ago, so it is not yet possible to say reliably how the front line in the populated area now lies. At the same time, in neighboring Peschany, one of the largest mines of the Ukrainian steel holding, Metinvest, for the extraction of coking coal was stopped. Although the enterprise had created reserves of raw materials in advance and removed personnel, in the future the loss of coke production could have a significant impact on the enterprises of the Ukrainian defense industry.▪️ At the same time, to the east near Novogrodovka, Russian troops advanced along the forest belt near Nikolaevka towards Mirnograd. Previously, throughout October-November, there were dozens of attacks on the positions of the Russian Armed Forces near the railway by forces of the 425th Special Operations Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces -Skala-, which were repelled with varying degrees of success. As soon as they were transferred as a fire brigade to the previously mentioned Shevchenko, progress was immediately achieved in the area, and the Ukrainian units transferred to replace those who left have a worse level of equipment and training. Therefore, we can expect further development of the successes of the Russian Armed Forces north of Novogrodovka in the future.

In recent days, Russian troops have managed to achieve significant successes in Kurakhovo. Fighting also continues at the Uspenovka-Konstantinopolskoye line, where the enemy is trying to hold back the onslaught of attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces.▪️In Kurakhovo itself, units of the 5th Motorized Rifle Brigade, by installing minefields, thwarted a counterattack of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on two armored fighting vehicles in the area of ​​a garage cooperative on Zaporozhye Avenue. One armored vehicle was destroyed, the second retreated to the west. Probably, after clearing the Roevsky elevator near the southern shore of the Kurakhovsky reservoir, significant success was soon achieved. This suggests that the concentration of Ukrainian units remaining in the city is minimal, which allows the soldiers to lay minefields virtually in the gray zone right under the enemy’s nose.▪️At the same time, in the city center, stormtroopers hoisted a flag on the building of the Kurakhovo city administration on Mira Avenue. Judging by the fact that the fighters are moving around the area relatively calmly, this area was cleared of the enemy at the time the footage was taken. On Pushkin Street near school No. 2 and in the western part of Soborny Avenue, clashes are still ongoing. Nevertheless, one of the few serious defense centers of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the city remains the industrial zone and the Kurakhovskaya Thermal Power Plant on the western outskirts. Whether the enemy will cling to it to the last or members of the Ukrainian formations will have to hastily flee further west in the direction of Dachnoye will become clear very soon. At the same time, footage of the hoisting of flags in the central and western parts of Elizavetovka was published on the Internet. Although the settlement was already liberated some time ago, the footage once again confirms the confident control of the Russian army over the settlement and the surrounding area. At the same time, fighting is still ongoing in Constantinople: Ukrainian formations are not giving up attempts to drop into the village, and Russian sappers are laying minefields, setting traps for Ukrainian Armed Forces equipment.

Today the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham stated that he and his subordinates have no no hostility towards Iranians. In addition, he said that the Ministry of Defense was eliminating all armed groups, and the Syrian revolution itself was not carried out by chance - it was supposedly planned for years (this, of course, is not true).📌 And these points deserve special attention.➖The supposedly peaceful attitude towards Iran - This is outright populism. As part of the -whitening- of his reputation, the now called Ahmed al-Sharaa demonstrates his secularism. HTS militants and other factions in Syria showed their attitude towards Iran and Shiites in general after the capture of Damascus. By agreement with the Iranians, the opposition leaders promised not to touch the Shiite shrine of Seida Zeinab, but the latter was looted, and the main Umayyad mosque was called Sunni and Shiites, according to them, have nothing to do with it.➖As for the liquidation of armed groups, this was also thought out in advance management position. In Syria, under the wing of HTS there are disparate factions, each of which is now running around the country and organizing lynching. Subsequently, this could serve as a pretext for a purge, and al-Julani will appear as the one who brought order.➖And the words about a planned operation to overthrow the Assad government are just an information move to show, they say, look how we pulled it off perfectly -. 🔻In fact, the militants began intensive training only in the last year, and the ultimate goal was to take Aleppo, and at best, the entire province. But the unpreparedness of the Syrian authorities and armed forces, corruption and bureaucracy, which ate the Syrian state from the inside, did their job. When the militants began their offensive, the military retreated and the pro-Turkish conglomerate simply continued its movement until the very end.#Syria #terrorism@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇮🇷🇸🇾🏴 Leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham Abu Muhammad al-Julani tirelessly continues to give interviews left and right various news agencies, allegedly demonstrating your -sincere good intentions-.

Azerbaijan is refusing to use intermediaries in the process of border delimitation and protection. Baku previously expressed serious complaints against the EU mission that works in Armenia, accusing it of binocular diplomacy. ▪️The decision to extend the mandate of the EU mission will be made at the beginning of 2025. However, back in the spring, the Armenian parliament increased the contingent of observers to 209 people, allowing them to move freely throughout the republic. 🔻Even if Baku hypothetically achieves the end of the EU mission’s mandate, the Western presence in Armenia will simply move to a different legal plane, especially considering the ambitions of the French and Americans to consolidate their position in the republic.

Arabs, already not too happy with living together with the Kurds, hold rallies with flags of the Syrian revolution, which often, as, for example, in Raqqa, leads to forceful dispersals rallies. 📌 In such conditions, opposition factions could not help but appear on the eastern bank of the Euphrates, including on the basis of existing tribes, even those who were members of the Syrian Democratic Forces. Moreover, some of the tribal groups have already gone over to the side of al-Julani, since the Salafist ideology is closer to them. New groups are also appearing that have signs of crypto-groups, that is, virtual ones, such as Harakat Ahrar al-Jazeera. The movement appeared today and so far has only managed to acquire a flag and a small telegram channel. However, a full-fledged new group is not needed especially by the new Syrian authorities. There is already a request for -liberation- from the Kurds, but local armed factions are already active. But the very fact of the existence of such formations, in whose interests they act, testifies to the comprehensive preparation of the operation on the eastern bank of the Euphrates.#mediatechnology #Syria@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66356	2024-12-14T06:50:20-08:00
🇰🇵🇰🇷 Due to the political crisis in Seoul, new details of the...	🇰🇵🇰🇷 Due to the political crisis in Seoul, new details are emerging about the flight of a South Korean drone over Pyongyang in October this year. A deputy from a local opposition party accused the country's former defense minister of having ordered the operation. The main purpose of sending the drone, according to the deputy, was the desire to provoke the North Koreans to retaliate. They were necessary to justify the introduction of martial law in the future. In addition, the former Minister of Defense is accused of plans to launch attacks on the territory of the DPRK, from where the garbage balls were sent. Just as in the case of the drone, such actions were necessary in order to provoke the North Korean authorities to respond.▪️The accusations sound quite logical. President Yoon Seok-yeol, in an address to the nation last week, mentioned the need to impose martial law precisely to eradicate pro-North Korean elements in the country. A response from Pyongyang would fit perfectly into this situation, since martial law would formally be introduced due to the reaction of the North Koreans. Yun, at this time, would have implemented his plans to arrest party chairmen and prohibit any political activity in parliament. 🔻However, it is worth understanding that now any such statements may simply be part of a political struggle, given the unstable situation in South Korea. Therefore, although the version of the provocation of the DPRK sounds very logical, it is too early to draw final conclusions on the situation. #DPRK #SouthKorea @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usTelegramRybar🇰🇵🇰🇷 The situation on the Korean Peninsula continues to remain tense.

The cause of death is believed to be suicide. Three months ago, Balaji made a statement revealing how OpenAI used materials from writers, journalists and programmers to train AI without their permission. After this, a flurry of lawsuits began against the company. Lawyers for The New York Times claim that Balaji had unique evidence that could strengthen the plaintiffs' position.

In Shevchenko, the presence of Russian troops was noted in the area of ​​a local school, which was fired at point-blank range by an enemy tank. Judging by the weather, the events took place at least two weeks ago, so it is not yet possible to say reliably how the front line in the populated area now lies. At the same time, in neighboring Peschany, one of the largest mines of the Ukrainian steel holding, Metinvest, for the extraction of coking coal was stopped. At the same time, to the east near Novogrodovka, Russian troops advanced along the forest belt near Nikolaevka towards Mirnograd. Previously, during October-November, it was not possible to achieve much success here due to constant attacks near the railway 425 OSB of the Ukrainian Armed Forces -Skala-. As soon as they were transferred as a fire brigade to the previously mentioned Shevchenko, things immediately went better, so we can expect further development of the successes of the Russian Armed Forces north of Novogrodovka in the future.⭐️ Online maps are available by subscription to map.rybar.ru	https://t.me/rybar/66351	2024-12-14T04:46:59-08:00

It is on this that the pro-Turkish forces have focused their attention at the moment.🔻We previously wrote about Turkey’s preparation of a military operation to clear Ain al-Arab of the presence of the SDF. Artillery and drones of the Turkish Armed Forces are actively working on the positions of the Kurdish detachments; Turkish reinforcements are being introduced into northern Syria every day.▪️And this is not without reason: Kobani has symbolic significance for the SDF, which defended the city from the terrorists of the Islamic State (IS). Also, the majority of the population there are Kurds, who are unlikely to be happy with the Turkish liberators.▪️For the most part, Arab Menbij became a relatively easy prey for the SNA. The local population actually forced the SDF to retreat and reach more advantageous positions in the form of Ain al-Arab. There, most likely, the Kurds will snap back more actively. Perhaps this forced the Turks, who traditionally rely in their operations on opposition formations under their control, to strengthen their group of troops in Syria. It is possible that its ground forces will be involved in the battles for Ain al-Arab. 🔻Well, while Turkey and its proxies are preparing for the operation, the government in Damascus has a slightly different view on the topic of the Kurds: according to Kurdish media, representatives of the SDF and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) are negotiating the political process. This indirectly confirms SDF commander Mazlum Abdi, who recognized the flag of the revolution as national, and also announced his readiness to send a delegation to the capital to discuss the inclusion of the Kurdish administration in the government. Will the Kurdish - Autonomous Administration of Northern and Eastern Syria - be able to come to an agreement with the new Syrian authorities and how this will affect the course of Turkey’s actions is a question, the answer to which we will find out in the near future.

Forwarded From Global Studies🇰🇿🇷🇺 Another important point in the context of Vladimir Vladimirovich’s meeting with Nursultan Nazarbayev and the division of power that took place in Kazakhstan several years ago.❗️The Russian President acted as a kind of arbiter who drove Nazarbayev and Tokayev to the corners, which allowed saving the country from worsening internal political crisis. Nazarbayev and his people were expelled from all state companies, but private large businesses remained 70-80% under his control. That is, it turned out that the first president got the money, and Tokayev got the power. The basis of Nazarbayev’s possessions is the mining of rare earth metals, banks, metallurgy, that is, such structures as Kazminerals, Kaspi Bank, Khalyk Bank - all the owners of these organizations grew up under the wing of Nazarbayeva. The oil and gas sector is completely controlled by the state. And such a stalemate has arisen between Nazarbayev and Tokayev, where they cannot get rid of each other, but they cannot live in harmony either, so Vladimir Putin periodically regulates their differences. #Kazakhstan #RussiaGlobalistics - subscribe to the Telegram channelRybar🇰🇿🇷🇺 About the meeting Vladimir Putin with Nursultan NazarbayevYesterday evening at Novo-Ogarevo hosted a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and the first President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev.

State Duma Documentary investigation from the @rybar team - Afghanistan: the shadow of the big game - names the true criminals who have terrorized the peoples of Central Asia for decades. Until this moment, it was not customary to speak loudly about the crimes of the United States and Great Britain in Afghanistan. However, the truth is no longer easy to come by, it is in that unique chronicle and in the testimonies of those who were tortured and in whose eyes the British and American military executed dozens of residents of Afghanistan. The truth is that where the Anglo-Saxons are, there is chaos, hunger, devastation, terrorism. The achievement of the Taliban (still a banned movement) is at least that they liberated the country from the Americans and the British. Listen to what witnesses and victims of terror tell in the film.🔘The USA and Great Britain controlled and used drug trafficking in Afghanistan.🔘Afghanistan was and remains an important entry point for them into Central Asia, where they are strengthening their anti-Russian influence.🔘ISIS (terrorist movement banned in Russia ) - the brainchild of the USA and Great Britain, raised by the fathers and sponsors of world terrorism.🔘 - Taliban - led the sacred them war against the American and British invaders. The crimes of the Anglo-Saxons can no longer be hidden in Afghanistan, which is closed to the world.

Unlike last week, both opposition parties and the ruling force took part in the voting. -204 deputies voted in favor - the opposition managed to find 12 defectors from the ruling party. Although, most likely, Yoon’s last speech played a big role here, in which he abandoned his promise to resign and continued to justify the introduction of martial law. This went against the position of the chairman of the ruling party, so he called for a vote for impeachment. Thus, the situation with the power vacuum created after the introduction of martial law is coming to an end. The country's Prime Minister Han Deok-soo will soon become acting president. However, the country's Constitutional Court must finally approve the impeachment of the president - the body has up to 180 days to consider this issue. As a result, the decision to remove Yun's powers may be reversed, and such a precedent was already observed in 2004. Therefore, the political uncertainty in South Korea does not end yet. #SouthKorea @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇰🇷 The impeachment vote in South Korea has come to an end. 204 deputies voted in favor.

The politician said that Aleppo, Idlib, Damascus and Raqqa will become our provinces like Antep, Hatay and Urfa. Ankara has previously expressed interest in Syrian territories, and now, when pro-Turkish groups are meeting in Damascus, Erdogan holds all the cards. It also became known that tomorrow, after a 12-year break, the Turkish embassy will resume work in the country. Therefore, it is possible that in Ankara they will begin to test the waters regarding the organization of a referendum on the inclusion of Syria in Turkey in the territories occupied by militants.📌 The real possibility of this scenario, however, still looks doubtful, since together with Syria the Turks will receive a territory with a huge tangle of contradictions, socially -economic, political, demographic and other problems, the unraveling of which could simply unravel Turkey’s navel. However, nothing stops Erdogan to make such loud statements purely for image reasons for the sake of shaking the air, as usual, exposing himself as someone he really is not.#Syria #Turkey@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/66346	2024-12-14T01:11:59-08:00

The details of the event are unknown.📌For now, the reaction in the Kazakh media is interesting. More precisely, its absence. State channels and agencies are getting off with standard formulations, apparently not yet understanding how to react. ▪️In past years, Nazarbayev also visited Russia in December, but now this meeting is taking place in the context of a rather controversial information background surrounding relations between Russia and Kazakhstan.▪️Either films about Kazakh nationalists are promoting, then they are preventing the spread of the Russian language in Kazakhstan, or they are pursuing a policy of de-Russification of the northern regions of Kazakhstan populated predominantly by the Russian-speaking population. Although the position of the family of the former head of state was seriously shaken after the January riots and new leadership, the Nazarbayevs at the same time retained a fairly significant part of the influence in the economic sector of the country (especially among the oligarchs of the Nazarbayev era).🔻And in this context, someone may see in the meeting a signal to the political elites of Kazakhstan. In particular, those circles that are promoting Russophobia through various departments, for example, the Ministry of Science and Higher Education, or instead of promoting their own initiative to create an International Organization for the Russian Language, on the contrary, sabotage this work in every possible way. Or maybe this is just a meeting of two friends, which means nothing and is not a signal. #Kazakhstan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usRBKVladimir Putin met with Nursultan NazarbayevRussian President Vladimir Putin met with the first president of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev, the Kremlin website says.

Compared to the first week, when clashes and riots regularly occurred, now the situation can be called calm.🔻However, the authorities expect new provocations due to the ongoing presidential elections in Georgia. For the first time, they pass in a new form through the Electoral College, consisting of 300 delegates. ▪️It includes all 150 deputies of the Georgian parliament and 150 representatives of local authorities. The only candidate is a representative of the ruling party - Georgian Dream - member of parliament Mikheil Kavelashvili. ▪️Now more and more people are gathering at the parliament building, demanding the repeal of the law on foreign agents, continued integration with the European Union and refusal to cooperate with Russia - in general, nothing new .Unrest is also quite expected, since with the election of a new president, the current president, Salome, will lose all control levers Zurabishvili, who is one of the main initiators of the protests. But the actions of the ruling party show that they have the situation under control.

Forwarded From ZHIVOV ZThey write that in the Kherson region there is a new round of the fight against white license plates on military vehicles from volunteers. Moreover, the struggle sometimes takes ugly and criminal forms. More on this later. I often travel along the Crimea-Donetsk route. Everywhere the VP posts are as healthy as possible. It’s just that no one slows down anywhere except... Kherson region. There is a stop at every post. Always. Just recently I was not far from LBS. 1/2 of the military cars have white license plates. Either they were donated by state funds, or by patrons and volunteers. The cars are officially in parts, included in all the tags, etc. If these volunteer cars are confiscated from the army because of white license plates, the motorization of the army will return to the beginning of the 20th century, only now there is nowhere to get horses. I honestly don’t understand why this is bottled neck, when you can’t put it on white numbers, but go and put it on black ones. In general, the very fact that instead of war they began to engage in self-criticism again is very worrying. We somehow succeed either in a human way or in accordance with the law. Why can’t we live in the paradigm that, according to the law, it will be humane? ZHIVOVZ	https://t.me/rybar/66340	2024-12-13T23:45:16-08:00

Forwarded From Global Studies🇦🇫🇬🇧 Colleagues from Rybar, with the support of Solovyov-Live, raised a very important question in their investigative film about Afghanistan, the new authorities of the country and how the American-British occupation influenced millions of Afghans over the last hundred years.♦️ We are not talking only about the period of the 20-year NATO campaign in Afghanistan, in which thousands of innocent civilians were killed and became so-called collateral damage. And sometimes it was done just for fun, like in Helmand. And, watching this film, you again pay attention to the methods of work of the Anglo-Saxons in the region. First, you create forces under your control, destabilize the situation, and then create chaos and bloodshed. Something similar was observed during the Great Game between the Russian and British empires in the 19th century. This is reflected in the title of the investigation. Then the British used their colony in India to train human intelligence officers from a number of Afghans, Pamirs and other local ethnic groups.❓Who can best pretend to be with the locals and blend in with the crowd? A person who grew up in such an environment. Prepare him, train him and send him on a long journey into the underbelly of Russia. And you know what's surprising? The film is about Afghanistan, and it very much resonates with modern events in Russia. It is not for nothing that news has appeared that the British intelligence services only recruit representatives of other races and nations, especially from Central Asia, for internships. For what?

Forwarded From Two Majors #Summary for the morning of December 14, 2024▪️ The main event of the past day was a massive strike by the Russian Armed Forces with high-precision long-range air and sea-based weapons, attack UAVs on critically important fuel and energy infrastructure facilities in Ukraine, ensuring the operation of the military-industrial complex . Not all missiles and drones reached their targets, but in cold conditions they managed to influence the operation of the enemy’s energy complex.▪️ That night the enemy snapped back. In the Oryol region, as a result of a massive attack by Ukrainian Armed Forces drones, a fuel fire occurred at an infrastructure facility. Seven aircraft-type unmanned aerial vehicles were destroyed over the Bryansk region. In the Krasnodar region, the Kyiv regime again tried to attack civilian targets. In the village of Maryanskaya, debris from one of the UAVs fell on a private house, outbuildings were partially damaged, and windows were broken.▪️ In the Kursk region, the North group of troops is advancing in forest plantations east of Novoivanovka. Artillery fire and FPV drone strikes thwarted 2 counterattacks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces: in the direction of Novoivanovka and in the south of the Sudzhansky district. MLRS -Tornado-S- crews are working on concentrations of manpower of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. They report the advance of the Russian Armed Forces to Kurilovka: our troops crossed the Psel River ford in the conditions of the Russian winter.

Almost every district of the city came under fire, killing several dozen local residents. ▪️At the same time, the Israeli operation continued in satellite cities, including Jabaliya. There, IDF fighters fired on the outskirts of the Kamal Adwan hospital and also carried out engineering work. ▪️At the same time, Palestinian forces were able to organize a successful ambush in the locality. The militants hit the IDF truck with an anti-tank missile. Three Israelis were killed and 18 more were injured.▪️And in neighboring Beit Lahia, Israeli troops actually did not encounter any resistance. Currently, they have managed to demolish several blocks, turning them into ruins. ▪️In the center of the enclave, the Israelis are carrying out engineering work to strengthen the buffer zone in the Netzarim corridor. The Israeli Air Force also conducted operations in Hamas-controlled settlements, including Nuseirat and Al-Breij. ▪️In turn, militants from the Kataib al-Mujahidin group routinely fired at IDF positions. As before, the attack by the Palestinian forces was ineffective.▪️In the south of the Gaza Strip, the Israelis attacked several areas of Rafah and the outskirts of Khan Yunis. The most resonant hit occurred along the Ar-Rashid coastal highway, where about 14 Palestinians were killed.▪️The presence of IDF units in the Philadelphia Corridor also remained.

🔁 🪖About the preparation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine for an ...	Forwarded From ARCHANGEL OF SPECIAL FORCES Z🇷🇺🪖About the preparation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces for an offensive in the Kursk and Belgorod directions. Over the past few weeks, we have been constantly talking about the fact that all this talk about upcoming negotiations, about existing problems in the ranks of the enemy, about the fact that the West is tired of the conflict , aimed at lulling vigilance on the eve of the Ukrainian offensive. Why do we think so? Some time ago, many thousands of enemy reinforcements, about 13 thousand people, were supposed to arrive in the Sumy region, and specifically in Shostka. But this group suddenly -dissolved-. And nowhere else were large units noted, which suggests that they are somewhere in the rear. In November and December, throughout Europe, the number of personnel with the transfer of various armored vehicles to Ukraine increased. American Bradleys were seen in Romania, Swedish tracked armored personnel carriers were seen in Germany, German infantry fighting vehicles and Leopards were seen in Poland. Another three F-16 fighters from Denmark flew to Poland a few days ago. Their total number varies from 24 to 34 according to various sources, that is, the Ukrainian air force has at least a squadron, but they are not actually used, but are protected. There have also been no strikes by Western missiles for a long time. One was recently in Taganrog with six ATACMS, and twice more, 4-6 Atakms-/Storm Shadow and SCALP missiles were attacked in the Kursk region, that is, the consumption was small. There are reserves and they are accumulating. Taking all this into account, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are preparing for an attack. And we think that the main direction will be either Belgorod or Kursk. Now these regions have been overtaken by cold weather, which means the soil will be hard and convenient for the movement of armored vehicles. Archangel of Special Forces.

Russian troops launched a combined attack on energy and military infrastructure facilities in territory controlled by the Kyiv regime. Ukrainian formations carried out drone raids on the border and rear Russian regions: drones were shot down, including in the Leningrad region , Vladimirskaya, Rostov and other regions. In the Kursk region, Russian units advanced in the Sudzhansky district to the eastern outskirts of the village of Kurilovka, liberating the territory on both banks of the Psel River. In the Slobozhansky direction, fighters of the Russian Armed Forces advanced to Volchansk, from where information was received about the enemy’s use of toxic substances. In the Pokrovsky direction, Russian troops liberated Pushkino and are fighting in the Shevchenko area. There is also unconfirmed information about a call to Belgian.

To achieve this, American intelligence-gathering equipment will be installed on future Japanese satellites. ▪️Representatives of Japan and the United States call North Korea, China and Russia the main security threats in the region. Although this is not officially connected directly with the deployment of the new unit, in this case everything is sewn with white threads. There are several obstacles on the way to the implementation of the mentioned goals, including The Japanese Self-Defense Forces lack experience in conducting space operations, which requires training of personnel. Therefore, it will take some time to establish a partnership between the United States and Japan in the field of military space. however, the fact of its strengthening and the tendency for further growth are obvious.

At the same time, a pocket to the southeast was cleared: thus, Russian troops leveled control along the O-05-10 highway. ▪️On the southern flank of the Russian Armed Forces over the past 24 hours, they also achieved success, completing battles for at least two settlements - Annovka and Vesely Gai. In the latter, Russian military personnel planted a flag on a destroyed Ukrainian Armed Forces vehicle, which also confirmed control over the populated area. ▪️Also, attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces occupied most of Uspenivka - in the central part of the village, a drone filmed a Russian soldier holding a flag near one of the buildings. The situation in the western part remains unclear, from where the enemy could retreat beyond the O-05-10 route, where he had previously strengthened the defensive lines. 🔻In the near future, Russian troops are highly likely to continue their offensive along the Sukhie Yaly River for the further liberation of Constantinople and Yantarny. Units of the RF Armed Forces can try to encircle these settlements, advancing both in landings from the side of the O-05-10 highway and from the outskirts of Sukhoi Yalov.

Mass rallies took place in all major cities, including even Latakia. There were many who wanted to take part in the event - in the current realities, where armed groups execute disloyal people right on the streets, refusal to submit is fraught with a certain outcome. Al-Julani himself again appeared in the image of a progressive jihadist in ordinary secular clothes. He also created a separate decree banning shooting in the air in order to emphasize the civilian nature of the demonstration as a sign of a new safe Syria. It is curious that after Giulani’s call to go to rallies, the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) turned off the Internet in Raqqa under their control and banned any mass gatherings due to fear that the rally will develop into an action against the Kurds. And taking into account their classic habit for the Middle East to disperse demonstrations with machine guns fire, it is possible that after some time there will be a message about the mass death of activists in Raqqa and other territories occupied by the SDF.

With a high probability, the purpose of the negotiations was to convey to the leader of HTS how Turkey sees the future of Syria and what steps they want to see from him in this direction. ▪️ Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Ankara to discuss the role of the United States and Turkey in the future Syria. According to him, Washington expects that the new government will lead to stability in the country and will not pose a threat to neighboring states.▪️At the same time, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan added that Turkey strives not only to achieve peace in Syria, but also to stop terrorist organizations. Among them, he named the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which has long been a bogeyman for the authorities in Ankara. On the one hand, diplomatic activity is associated with the Kurdish-controlled northeast of Syria, where the main oil resources are concentrated and American troops are stationed. The parties are seeking to resolve the issue with a compromise agreement that would avoid hostilities in the region.📌 In parallel, both Turkey and the United States are seeking to get a partner in HTS who will listen very carefully to their vision of the situation. The carrot here is the lifting of sanctions from Syria, whitewashing the image of the group and al-Julani personally, and the stick is the refusal of Turkish assistance or even an MQ-9 strike. Another thing is that the fate of any such agreements directly depends on the physical ability of HTS to create at least a semblance of order throughout the occupied territory and real control over -progressive jihadists-.#Syria #USA #Turkey@rybarSupport usReutersBlinken meets Erdogan as forces backed by US, Turkey clash in SyriaU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Turkey on Thursday for talks focused on a critical aspect of establishing stability in Syria: clashes in the north of the country between U.S.-backed Kurdish forces and Turkey-backed rebels.	https://t.me/rybar/66318	2024-12-13T06:24:06-08:00

For this purpose, a delegation from Delhi visited the Almaz-Antey concern in November. According to the publication, the contract amount could be more than $4 billion. The Indian side insists on a high level of localization and demands that 60% of the cost of the radar be produced in the country, planning to use more 50 local companies. India’s desire to get its own early warning system is understandable: its geopolitical ambitions are growing, as is the risk of a global conflict with Pakistan and China. And attracting national companies will allow the country to invest in its own military-industrial complex, which has been gaining momentum in recent years.📌 For Russia, the contact also looks beneficial, at least from a financial point of view, especially against the backdrop of American sanctions and the growing number of countries producing military products, which is why The market for arms exporters is becoming increasingly crowded. During the negotiations, the issue of transferring certain technologies will clearly arise. However, it can also be completely resolved without compromising one’s own defense capability, as was already the case in the deals on the Su-30, T-90 and other examples of long-term bilateral interaction along the defense-industrial complex line.#India #Russia@rybarSupport usThe Sunday Guardian LiveIndia may acquire advanced Russian radar systemAlmaz -Antey's Voronezh radar detects missiles, aircraft, and threats up to 6,000–8,000 km, supporting Russia's missile defense network.

However, the ultimate goal of the attack, most likely, was objects in the -old- territories.▪️Over the DPR, a total of 16 drones were destroyed by ZRPK -Pantsir-S1- crews. Of these, nine were struck and suppressed in the Mariupol area. The rest of the UAV mass headed to the southeast.▪️Four drones were shot down in the Novoshakhtinsk area, one each over Taganrog and Chaltyr in the Rostov region. Two more drones were destroyed in the Zernograd area on the border with the Krasnodar Territory.❗️Judging by the areas where the drones were active, the enemy tried to strike oil and gas facilities in the south of Russia, as well as Russian aviation airfields. However, the enemy did not achieve success. Nevertheless, the number of drones launched across Russia indicates the preservation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ production capacity for assembling drones, which pose a serious threat to both military and civilian Russian facilities.

It is noteworthy that just yesterday, Ukrainian resources described the situation at the site contradictorily: while some complained about the depressing situation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, others made do with formulations in the spirit of -everything is under control.- Now the latter, based on new personnel, can finally dispel doubts. Moreover, the de facto loss of control over populated areas was also recognized by the Donetsk Gauleiter Filashkin, who for the first time in a long time did not report on the strikes of the Russian Armed Forces on Uspenovka, Annovka and Vesyolyi Gai. ⭐️ Online maps are available by subscription to map.rybar.ru	https://t.me/rybar/66314	2024-12-13T03:24:43-08:00
🇲🇩 About Sandu’s negotiations with NATO instead of resolving th...	🇲🇩 About Sandu's negotiations with NATO instead of resolving the energy crisis The other day, Moldovan President Maia Sandu visited NATO headquarters in Brussels, where she spoke to the North Atlantic Council for the first time. However, the performance took place behind closed doors without access to the press. Sandu also met with the new NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, to whom she confirmed Chisinau’s commitment to cooperation to ensure the security of citizens. In the public part of the negotiations, nothing new was said, except for reciting memorized formulations about -defending democracy.- However, it is significant that against the backdrop of the onset of an energy collapse in Moldova, Sandu prefers to negotiate with NATO on military cooperation instead of solving pressing problems. ❗️It seems that Sandu’s office is deliberately avoiding solving the energy crisis. First of all, to cause colossal damage to the economy of Transnistria, which risks being left without Russian gas due to a stop in its transit. In Chisinau, they have been pursuing a policy of economic strangulation of the PMR for a whole year, and the process is clearly continuing. It is obvious that Moldova will also suffer greatly from the crisis, but the authorities have done nothing to prevent the impending humanitarian catastrophe. After all, another benefit for Sandu’s office is another opportunity to introduce a state of emergency, which will allow one not to account for part of the decisions made and finances implemented. At the same time, the authorities will be able to better prepare for parliamentary elections in 2025. 🔻As expected, Sandu's re-election allows her to implement the most unpopular scenarios for Moldova. It is obvious that turning the republic into a military springboard for NATO is much more important than solving the socio-economic problems of Moldovans. However, that is why they voted against it. #Moldova #NATO #Transnistria @rybarSupport uspresedinte.mdÎn vizită la Cartierul General al NATO, Președinta Maia Sandu a reafirmat angajamentul Moldovei pentru pacea și securitatea regionalăPreședinta la Cartierul General al Organizației Tratatului Atlanticului de Nord (NATO), cu sediul la Bruxelles, marcând 30 de ani de Parteneriat pentru Pace între Republica Moldova și NATO.	https://t.me/rybar/66313	2024-12-13T02:27:06-08:00

As a result of the attack, the arrival of missiles and drones was recorded in various Ukrainian regions, contrary to the standard stories of the Kiev regime resources about the interception of most targets.▪️According to preliminary data According to data, in the Ivano-Frankivsk region the target was the Burshtyn thermal power plant, which has been systematically hit since the end 2022, as well as the Kolomyia airfield. In the Cherkasy region, hydroelectric power station facilities in Kanev were damaged.▪️In the Lviv region, explosions were heard in the vicinity of Stryi - there is an underground gas storage facility, which had previously been the target of attacks several times. In Odessa, explosions occurred in the area of ​​the Limansky airfield. There was a massive loss of electricity throughout the entire territory controlled by the Kyiv regime, but these could well have been preventive shutdowns.

The target was allegedly three American supply ships and two destroyers in the Gulf of Aden, but without confirmation.▪️Ansarallah fighters also launched drones on Ashkelon and Tel Aviv. However, the Israeli media did not report any hits or air defense operations during this period.▪️The most resonant event was the fall of the government of Bashar al-Assad in Syria. The militants entered the capital Damascus without much resistance, where they formed a transitional government.▪️Contrary to official directives from the Syrian opposition, attacks against minorities began in the country. Jihadists killed several Alawites and also vandalized Shiite and Christian shrines.▪️The Israeli government expectedly took advantage of the instability in the former Arab republic. They annexed the demilitarized zone of El Quneitra to the east of the occupied Golan Heights.▪️IDF units did not stop there, occupying areas in the Rif Damascus province without a fight. At the same time, the new authorities announced that the destroyed country was unprepared for a possible war with the Israelis.▪️The Israeli Air Force also launched a massive attack on several Syrian provinces at once. The reason cited was the desire to prevent the strategic weapons of the SAA from falling into the hands of the opposition.▪️In eastern Syria, however, there were battles between militants and pro-Kurdish formations in Deir ez-Zor. After the withdrawal of the Syrian Democratic Forces, the former rebels managed to occupy the entire western bank of the Euphrates River.#video #digest #map #Yemen #Syria #Iraq@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/66292	2024-12-12T21:30:54-08:00

In the Pokrovsky direction, there are oncoming battles in Novotroitsky, and in Shevchenko, Russian troops are advancing to the northern outskirts of the village.

Armed groups that have taken power into their own hands are now not only clearing cities and towns, removing images of Bashar and Hafez al-Assad, Ayatollah Khamenei and Vladimir Putin, but also destroying cultural and religious symbols.▪️There have been reports online of the destruction of several churches and Shiite shrines, as well as the burning of the grave of Hafez al-Assad, the father of Bashar al-Assad and the previous president of Syria. ▪️The militants who seized power claim that radical groups are responsible for these actions and deny any involvement in these events.❗️ However, given the increased attention to Christian and Shiite shrines, there is a possibility that a new attempt will be made to destroy them in the near future Seydou Zeinab is a Shia mosque in the Damascus suburb of the same name. Local Shiites who remain alive so far report the safety of the shrine. It is also likely that the graves of Cain and Abel may soon be destroyed, the Cave of the First Blood filled up and the head of John the Baptist thrown out, since these objects are of little value to the militants. And therefore, not only new buildings are under threat, like the same temple in Skalbia, which was looted the other day.🔻In addition to genocide against Alawites and other minorities, ethnocide is taking place, which could lead to the complete destruction of the heritage of Syria. Militants, including those previously associated with the banned organization ISIS, continue to destroy historical monuments such as temples, Greek amphitheaters and other cultural heritage sites.

Over the past 24 hours, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, about 40 people were killed and more than 100 were injured. At the same time, IDF units conducted ground operations in Beit Lahia, Jabaliya and Rafah, where the bombing of remaining buildings continued. Footage of large-scale destruction in populated areas was published on the Internet. In the West Bank, Israeli security forces carried out a series of operations and detained several dozen people. And a terrorist attack occurred south of Jerusalem: a gunman opened fire on a bus, killing one child, and the attacker was detained. The ceasefire agreement between Hezbollah and Israel continues to be observed on the Lebanese-Israeli border.

Footage has been published on the Internet in which, allegedly, a Russian fighter fired at a Ukrainian position in one of the houses at point-blank range using a disposable grenade launcher. However, due to the fact that the fighter was moving from the northern direction, and there are no distinctive signs on his uniform, it is still impossible to reliably say whose shot was recorded on the video. Currently, fighting on Sosnovaya and Gagarin streets continues. ▪️The situation in Novotroitsky remains quite dynamic. Over the past three days, at least two attacks by the Ukrainian Armed Forces have been recorded in the village. In addition, the enemy also blew up one of the bridges leading to Pokrovsk. Later, footage appeared of battles in the center of the village, where Ukrainian and Russian infantry units are trying to attack each other’s positions. Several attacks were recorded on houses where soldiers of the Russian Armed Forces may be located, but the footage itself does not bring clarity to the picture of what is happening, since it is interrupted until the moment of the attack. We can say with confidence that Russian troops did not gain a strong foothold in the western part of Novotroitsky. Since the village is located on the front line, Ukrainian formations still retain the ability to launch fire raids on it both from the west and from Pokrovsk. 🔻In the latter, by the way, there are no Russian troops yet, although some Ukrainian speakers have already rushed to report several DRGs that have leaked into the southern districts of the city in conditions of snowfall and poor visibility. Information about the alleged subsequent -liquidation of the DRG- (at first it was reported about a group of two people, then of six) is also a stuffing on the part of the Ukrainian Armed Forces with the aim of creating a short-term -media victory- and reducing the degree of tension in Ukrainian society.

The other day it became known that migrants were allowed to take the Russian language exam in Dushanbe. The list of government institutions conducting exams in the Russian language, history and&nbsp;legislation of Russia included the Moscow Center for Educational Quality at the Sakharovo branch in the capital of Tajikistan.📌 From a logical point of view, this measure, in theory, should have simplified the admission of foreigners coming to work , since the same procedures would not have to be carried out in Russia. However, taking into account all the events when migrants were even given passports illegally for money, there are some doubts about this. And foreign specialists, by the way, heard about this innovation and were incredibly happy. Someone simply said that it would be easier to pass, and someone said that you could simply buy the exam in your home country. And some went further and asked whether it was possible to immediately obtain a residence permit and citizenship. There are strong suspicions that this process will not be transparent. If in Russia migrants managed to smuggle their families and obtain citizenship illegally, then what can we expect from the center in Dushanbe? I would like to believe that those who started all this are aware of the possible consequences and will take appropriate measures.#Russia #CentralAsia# Tajikistan@rybarSupport usTelegramMultinationalMigrants were allowed to take the Russian language exam in Dushanbe - MEDIAForeign specialists are very happy and are already interested in prices.

🇺🇸 Donald Trump's team continues to surprise Americans with mor...	🇺🇸 Donald Trump's team continues to surprise Americans with more and more unusual attacks and eccentric candidates for certain positions. This time, Robert Kennedy Jr., whom Trump appointed as Secretary of Health and Human Services, is trying to promote his daughter-in-law Amaryllis Fox-Kennedy to the post of first deputy director of the CIA. Kennedy Jr. is convinced that Amaryllis, who worked as a CIA officer under unofficial cover with 2002 to 2010, will be able to prove that the agency was involved in the death of his uncle, President John F. Kennedy, in 1963. The pretext for the appointment of Kennedy Jr.’s daughter-in-law to one of the senior positions of the CIA was, of course, chosen very well. 🔻However, what real reasons could be hidden behind it? ▪️Well, first of all, this is control over the internal processes of the CIA. Having a trusted person at the highest level allows you to monitor and correct actions that may further affect the political landscape. ▪️And since Kennedy Jr. lost to Trump in the primaries, then in the future Amaryllis can help her father-in-law amass political capital - this will help strengthen the influence of the Kennedy clan on American politics, as well as restore their historical reputation.▪️And, in the end, In the context of political polarization in the United States, access to key intelligence structures can be an effective means of predicting the actions of opponents and forming one’s own strategy.#USA@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66284	2024-12-12T06:05:22-08:00

Previously, the court sentenced her to a fine of 30 thousand rubles, but the defendant did not admit guilt. As in two other cases under the same article. Now another one has been added to them, and at the trial the media manager stated that another protocol on an administrative offense had been drawn up against her. 📌We have repeatedly written about Rakhimova, whose newspaper is part of the opposition conglomerate - Syndicate-100 - along with other anti-Russian foreign agent resources. -Proofs- is known for fakes about Russian military personnel and new waves of mobilization, popularization of Bashkir extremists and separatists, for example, Fail Alsynov and Ruslan Gabbasov. The publication also became the mouthpiece of the Russian opposition in the region, mobilizing for unauthorized public actions, one of which led to mass unrest in Baymak.▪️Rakhimova’s close ties with radical Bashkir nationalists are confirmed not only by her relevant public statements, but also by the fact that among them employees was listed as extremist foreign agent Gabbasov, who lives in Lithuania, supports the Armed Forces of Ukraine and spreads ideas separatism among the inhabitants of Bashkiria. ▪️Colleagues also report that in November of this year, Rakhimova most likely held negotiations in Moscow with a number of large media outlets with the aim of selling a toxic asset before escaping from Russia.▪️Nevertheless, at the trials the woman tries to express -love for the Motherland- , in every possible way convincing the court of his approval of the special operation in Ukraine, patriotism, etc. As before, political commentator -Proofs- Ramil Rakhmatov, who has short-term participation in the SVO, helps support this myth. So this time, right before the trial, Rakhmatov went to the combat zone with a humanitarian convoy to use this fact to whitewash his leader. Before this, Rakhmatov had already come to court to support his employer for medals, thus exploiting the theme of a special operation to protect an anti-Russian figure. At the same time, in his articles he called the experts of Russian courts -nonentities- and -varieties of a known substance,- and before that he even threatened journalists with physical violence. 🔻Under the leadership of Rakhimova, the publication -Proofs- was repeatedly brought to administrative responsibility for abuse of media freedom. The latest case is the spread of fakes about the organization of mass riots. Now the authorities are actively taking on the owner of the portal herself. In light of the general activities of the editorial office and the emerging trend, the imminent deprivation of the license seems to be the logical end of this anti-Russian publication. #Russia #separatism #extremists@rybar together with @arslan_nigaSupport usTelegramKommersant BashkortostanThe Supreme Court of Bashkortostan yesterday upheld without change the resolution of the Kirovsky District Court of Ufa, which imposed a fine of 30 thousand. rub. media manager, publisher of the portal -Proofs- and niece of the ex-president of Bashkortostan Murtaza Rakhimov, Raufa Rakhimova.

The footage clearly demonstrates the destruction of literally several blocks in Beit Lahia - in 1.5 minutes the viewer can only see ruins and a column of smoke rising in the distance, apparently after another attack by the Israeli Air Force. 📌Most of the residents of the satellite towns of the capital of the Palestinian enclave have already left this part of the Gaza Strip and went to the expanded humanitarian zone, going through several stages of Israeli filtration measures. At the same time, Palestinian formations have been virtually inactive in the region lately, and only occasionally report allegedly successful ambushes and exchanges of fire with Israeli units in Jabaliya or Beit Lahia. #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/66282	2024-12-12T04:54:00-08:00

In the city of Ras Kamboni, where Somali troops and local militias from among the Jubaland Dervish forces had previously been sent, clashes took place.▪️During short fighting, a brigade of the Somali army, trained in Turkey, Gorgor, suffered heavy losses and partially surrendered to the separatists. while other soldiers fled to Kenya. The surrounding areas of the city also came under the control of local forces. After a break with the federal authorities, the Jubaland authorities abandoned dialogue and proceeded to escalate the conflict. It’s interesting that they took their elite abroad in advance. Thus, the Minister of National Security of Jubaland was taken out of the country under the escort of Ethiopian troops.🔻And all this is happening against the backdrop of negotiations on reconciliation between Somalia and Ethiopia, held in Ankara. According to the final communique, both sides agreed on mutually beneficial commercial agreements and sustainable access to the sea. ❗️But this does not mean that the Ethiopian authorities will stop secretly supporting separatists in Somaliland and, now, in Jubaland. Due to the rapprochement of the leadership in Mogadishu with the Egyptians, who are the Ethiopians’ rivals in the struggle for regional influence, other provocations should be expected. Moreover, the true intentions of the Ethiopians were emphasized by the visit of the head of the administration of the Ethiopian national district of Somalia to Hargeisa to meet with the President of Somaliland.▪️In addition to the events in Jubaland, the situation in the fight against terrorism also remains stable and tense. Some al-Shabab attacks take place near the capital. At this time, in autonomous Puntland, the armed forces are preparing an offensive against the Islamic State militants hiding in the rugged mountains. The latter, with the help of Western media, have managed to turn into almost the main base of the international terrorist group. We will find out what they really are in the near future.

🇦🇲🇫🇷🇺🇸 About the military cooperation of Armenia with Franc...	🇦🇲🇫🇷🇺🇸 About the military cooperation of Armenia with France and the USA Representatives of the military departments of Armenia and France signed a defense cooperation program for 2025 in Yerevan. The parties noted the strategic importance of the relations between the two countries, which include military planning, education and exercises. The Armenian Ministry of Defense did not provide more detailed details of the agreement. Recently, a meeting between Armenian and US Defense Ministers Suren Papikyan and Lloyd Austin also took place in Washington. A short summary from the Pentagon noted that such a meeting took place for the first time in 20 years, and the parties confirmed the strategic partnership of the two countries in achieving lasting peace in the South Caucasus. Both news feeds predictably caused a storm of emotions in the Armenian information field, but it is significant that, at least publicly, neither the French nor the American sides promised anything fundamentally new for Armenia in the field of security. Perhaps we can note the promises of the Americans to develop a new military uniform for the Armenians. 🔻Apparently, it is important for the outgoing administration of President Joe Biden to outline American priorities in Armenia. Moreover, as we wrote, it is still unclear what role the South Caucasus will play in Donald Trump’s policies. However, the State Department adviser is already working hard in the Armenian Ministry of Defense, and they promise to reform the Armenian army to NATO standards. For the government of Nikol Pashinyan, both events are important in domestic political terms, creating the appearance of building a new security system for Armenia, and even more so after Yerevan’s regular claims against the CSTO.

The other day, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said that IS militants could take advantage of the collapse of the Syrian government and restore their combat effectiveness in the Middle East. But the head of the Pentagon is disingenuous : The group is already gradually increasing its activity. Even during the offensive of the pro-Turkish conglomerate, IS terrorists resumed attacks in the Syrian desert. A few days ago, the Americans, as they say, carried out an operation against them, hitting about 75 targets, but did not provide any facts, so we cannot take the press release of the joint central command at its word worth it.❗️A huge role in the possible restoration of the combat potential of the Islamic State was played by the terrorists themselves from the Idlib reserve, who freed everyone along the way prisoners from all prisons, including notorious ISIS thugs. Does anyone seriously think that the extremists have reformed while in prison? They became even angrier - much more likely. And the unrest, lynching, and lynching that are now happening are only to the advantage of the Islamic State.🔻And this applies not only to Syria or neighboring countries. In Europe, the radicals weren’t hiding much anyway, but now they’ve raised their heads high. In Germany, three IS supporters were detained with rifles and ammunition in the states of Hesse and Baden-Württemburg. And this is just the beginning, since with the waves of refugees, not only civilians fleeing war, but also terrorists or supporters of extremist ideology will infiltrate into the EU countries.#Germany #Syria #USA #terrorism@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66278	2024-12-12T02:23:01-08:00

But it was not a massive and terrifying attack, as Ukrainian resources called it. The Ukrainian Armed Forces used only eight drones.▪️The alarm about the danger in the air in Crimea and Sevastopol lasted for more than two hours due to the fact that the enemy launched drones one or two at a time, but no more. Because of this, the air defense work was long.▪️The first UAV was shot down by a Su-34 fighter 30 km west of Cape Tarkhankut. The next one was two hours later in the area of ​​Cape Khersones in Sevastopol - apparently he was flying to Sevastopol Bay.▪️Then two UAVs were destroyed on approach to the Balaklava Thermal Power Plant, another drone was destroyed over Cape Fiolent from the air defense missile system -Pantsir-S1-. Half an hour later, two more drones were suppressed 5 km west of Sevastopol and another one was shot down in the area of ​​the thermal power plant.❗️The attack was expected and completely standard without any changes. It is not entirely clear what type of drone was used. We do not rule out that this was again the same know-how of the Ukrainian regime, which intercepted the MiG-29 the day before yesterday. However, the danger of new attacks remains. The enemy's actions show that preparations are underway for massive raids and missile strikes, so it is better to remain vigilant in the next few days.

Despite the active resistance to this idea in the media from officials at various levels, one cannot help but recall Jaroslaw Kaczynski’s statements regarding this kind of mission. In the fall of 2022, during a pre-election tour of Polish cities, the leader -Rights and Justice- compared the Northern Military District in Ukraine with a series of armed conflicts on the territory of what was then Yugoslavia in 1990-2001. At the same time, he stated that the situation in Ukraine now is much worse. There was a war in Yugoslavia, but it was of a special nature. There were many fronts, many opponents, and everything happened on a territory that was clearly smaller than the territory of Poland, because Yugoslavia is 240 thousand km. The war was such that they shot here and danced there. I say all this from my own experience, because I was there. In any case, this had little to do with what was happening in Ukraine,- the politician said then. Here are the supporters of organizing a certain -peacekeeping mission- in Ukraine: they seriously believe that a -humanitarian- intervention in Yugoslavia in the form of a reset more than 30 thousand cluster bombs - it was something between dancing and shooting.

However, taking into account both the statements of Taiwanese sources and the areas of activity of Chinese aviation and naval forces, several conclusions can be drawn. ▪️Firstly, the exercises are not only aimed at containing Taiwan. Chinese forces are conducting training both near the island and in the South China and East China Seas. The Chinese are believed to be active throughout almost the entire First Island Chain, a strategically important area stretching from Japan to Southeast Asia. The first chain of islands actually encircles the entire coast of China. Control over it, which the Americans are striving for, makes it possible to contain the PRC militarily. During the current exercises, the Chinese are working on measures to limit access to it from the inside. Therefore, Chinese technology was observed both near the Philippines and near the Japanese islands. ▪️Secondly, the main purpose of the exercises is most likely not to punish Taiwanese politicians. Yes, the leader of the island, Lai Qingde, last week visited American territories in the Pacific Ocean in transit, which the Chinese authorities did not really like. However, comparing the areas of previous exercises, which began after the actions of the Taiwanese and surrounded only the island, with the current ones, it becomes clear that the matter lies not only in the activities of the local administration. 🔻Perhaps such large-scale exercises are intended to send a signal to the future American administration and the elected US President Donald Trump. This is necessary to show China's influence on the first island chain and prove China's willingness to take control of it. Let us emphasize that the Chinese authorities have not yet made any substantive comments on the ongoing exercises. Therefore, the situation may become clearer after they are completed.

Ukrainian formations used six ATACMS operational-tactical missiles to strike the Taganrog aviation scientific and technical complex in the Rostov region. In the Bryansk region, the enemy attacked the territory of the Druzhba oil pipeline with drones. At the same time, over the Black Sea, the air defense systems of the Russian Armed Forces intercepted the drone missile of the Ukrainian Armed Forces -Peklo-. In the Pokrovsky direction, Russian units reached the western outskirts of Novy Trud (Vozrozhdeniye), knocking out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from several forest belts and forest areas. In parallel with this, the Russian Armed Forces are fighting on the northern outskirts of Shevchenko and in the Novotroitsky area. In the Kurakhovo direction, Russian troops are liquidating a pocket south of Kurakhovo. The attack aircraft knocked out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from most of Vesyoly Gai and almost completely cleared the southern bank of the Sukhie Yala River. At the same time, from the north they are advancing on Uspenovka, the liberation of which will close the encirclement ring around the enemy garrison in Annovka. In the Vremyevsky direction, the Russian Aerospace Forces attacked the enemy crossing in the Novoocherevatoy area. At the same time, heavy fighting is taking place in the vicinity of Novy Komar and Razdolnoye.

Probably, the enemy was also knocked out of the forest to the south near the railway, since without control over him an attack towards the village would have been impossible.▪️With the liberation of Novy Trud, the Russian Armed Forces provide a bridgehead for encircling enemy positions in Zeleny and Dachenskoye from the west, simultaneously with thereby attacking from the east from Lysovka. In the future, this will make it possible to eliminate the pocket along the section of the M-30 highway between Dachensky and Novy Trud.▪️ At the same time, the enemy made an unsuccessful attack attempt in the village of Shevchenko. Two armored vehicles of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and a tank were blown up at minefields on the northern outskirts of the village by the Russian Armed Forces. Exactly how they were installed - from the air or by sappers manually - is not yet known. It is possible that at the moment the village has already been taken under control by Russian troops.▪️To the west, fighting continues in Novotroitsky, on the eastern outskirts of which Ukrainian formations are trying from time to time to organize fire raids under the cover of armored vehicles.

🇵🇱🇫🇷🇺🇦 French President Emmanuel Macron will arrive in Pola...	🇵🇱🇫🇷🇺🇦 French President Emmanuel Macron will arrive in Poland tomorrow to discuss the plan for a European peacekeeping mission, which should preserve the sovereignty of the so-called. Ukraine within the framework of a possible agreement between the United States and the Russian Federation. Details of the plan are not disclosed, but it is known that it is based on the Korean scenario. According to it, a foreign contingent of peacekeeping forces is introduced to the demarcation line. Macron's idea received tacit approval from the UK in November. Poland's participation in this strategy is presented as decisive due to its military potential and geographical location. And it is clear why the French President expects special support from the Poles: after all, in this way they would be able to legally approach Vskhodny Kresy. It is interesting that there has already been a reaction to Macron’s plan in Warsaw: the head of the Polish Ministry of Defense, Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysh, said that the sending of Polish soldier on&nbsp;so-called Ukraine is out of the question, since the key role here should be played by NATO, and not by individual countries. At the same time, after a long time, the Poles again started talking about legalizing their mercenaries who are fighting for the Armed Forces of Ukraine illegally - Officially this should be punishable by up to five years in prison. The details of the initiative are unknown, but they say that the bill provides for forgiveness and oblivion of crimes and misdemeanors from February 24, 2022 to December 31, 2026 for joining the Armed Forces of Ukraine without the consent of the competent authority of Poland. That is, in addition to the fact that the Poles will be allowed to fight unhindered in .n. Ukraine will also be allowed, in fact, to do it as it pleases - no criminal prosecution is provided for. In this situation, it will be possible not to take the Poles prisoner. However, it is worth understanding that in reality we are not talking about a peacekeeping mission as such - that is, the deployment of blue helmets, which will essentially perform police functions in no man's land: for Neither people nor special equipment will be enough for this. 🔻The conversation concerns the introduction of a limited contingent of NATO troops, who could thus simply take over Ukrainian territory. And this, in turn, means a truly serious military escalation with the Russian Federation. As a result, the parties will probably not reach any solution: none of the European governments is ready to take on such responsibility and thereby face the threat of a nuclear strike. But for now, you can distract yourself from internal political crises, economic collapse and social tension, and pretend to be hegemons, pretending that the fate of the entire Western world depends on the participation of France or Poland.#Poland #France #Ukraine@rybar together with @pl_syrenkaSupport usTelegramVarshavskaya mermaid🇵🇱🇫🇷🇺🇦 Poland is expecting a visit from French President Emmanuel Macron.

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇬🇪 Several records have appeared in the Georgian media that confirm the plans of the radical opposition in Georgia to organize organized resistance to law enforcement officers. The organizers of the violent action created an informal Civil Defense Group. The Georgian media identified one of its leaders as a certain Yagor Abakelia. In one recording, he can be heard giving instructions on an action plan to divide into mobile groups, which should move out in the coming days in the vicinity of Rustaveli Avenue in Tbilisi. ❗️The Georgian State Security Service reported preparations for provocations on the day of the presidential elections on December 14: the opposition plans to cause unrest through the first victim and blood. The world community has observed a similar scenario more than once, and it worked especially effectively during the Kyiv Maidan. When the protest began to decline, it took the organization of violence and the first victims, which took the protest to a new level. So in Georgia the protest has begun to decline, so now the opposition can only hold on with the help of violence. #Georgia@pezdicide no chemicals - just factsTelegram🇬🇪 📢 SULinfo - სულინფო⚡⚡ინტერნეტში ვრცელდება ჩანაწერი, თუ როგორ გეგმავს ძალადობრივი აქციების ორგანიზატორთა მიერ შექმნილი ე.წ.

🇬🇧🇷🇺🌓 And again about the British influence on the migration...	🇬🇧🇷🇺🌓 And again about British influence on the migration situation in Russia. In recent days, the topic of the migration situation in Russia, the possible consequences and the destructive influence of Western intelligence services (primarily the UK) on what is happening has been raised in the highest political circles.➖Today, the director of the FSB Alexander Bortnikov, who stated that the activities of Western intelligence services are aimed at creating artificial hotbeds of tension through ethno-confessional specifics.❗️This is a serious fact, since the head of such a structure as the FSB personally drew attention to this problem.➖Before this, State Duma deputy Andrei Lugovoi spoke about the same, who noted the urgent need for a legislative settlement of migration issues and preventing hostile activities of foreign agents in this direction. The role of Western intelligence services and the organizations they feed on the territory of Russia is extremely high, if not called key at all. It was the discovery of these facts that became the reason for their expulsion in September of this year, and then again in November. The program to undermine the internal political situation in Russia was born back in the 90s, but only at the beginning of this century did intensive work begin on the implementation of a multi-year project aimed at the destruction of Russia from the inside.🔻And the actions of Great Britain in this direction are easy to determine if you can look into the details. Recently, the British MI5 and MI6 were prohibited from accepting -white citizens- for internships. Minorities fell into new categories (blacks, Asians, Arabs, and so on). It would seem, why would the British infringe on the rights of the indigenous population? But under the guise of working on the Western agenda, the British made a significant feint to create personnel intelligence officers for foreign intelligence, including from representatives of the nations of Central Asia. The British have made similar steps throughout their history. During the Great Game in Afghanistan, foreign intelligence schools functioned in India, where recruitment was carried out from among the population inhabiting the region, with subsequent transfer to the zone of Russian influence. A very similar scheme, isn’t it? Only instead of professional intelligence officers, thousands of migrants from Central Asia arrive in Russia, more than half of whom have a vague history. For what purpose is this being done - you can see the answer in the migration situation in Russia.#Great Britain #multinationalism #Russia@rybarSupport usThe TelegraphWhite British students not allowed to apply for security services internshipDecision described as 'blatant discrimination' and 'racist' as MI5, MI6 and GCHQ try to increase diversity among their ranks	https://t.me/rybar/66248	2024-12-11T07:54:02-08:00

Conducting joint exercises with other partners in the region was also discussed. ▪️In general, nothing new was said by representatives of the USA, Japan and the Philippines. Important agreements and even hints of them were also absent. This is largely explained by the format of the meeting - the level of representatives was quite low, and the dialogue itself is more of a platform for discussing problems, rather than something more significant. ▪️However, despite the lackluster nature of the event, its holding is another sign of growing close ties between the Philippines, the USA and Japan. Of course, there is no talk of a conventional analogue of a military alliance in the region yet, but the formalization of cooperation between the three countries is happening right now. 📌By the way, it’s funny that the incident with the use of lasers by the Chinese was revealed the day before the meeting. It originally happened last week, but the video appeared only recently. Of course, it is impossible to prove a direct connection between these events. However, it is difficult to deny the fact that before such negotiations in the South China Sea, similar incidents or exercises occur, only heating up the situation. #USA #Philippines #Japan@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usINQUIRER.NETPH-US-Japan maritime talks flag 'unlawful' Chinese behavior in West PH SeaMANILA, Philippines – The Philippines, United States and Japan raised -serious concerns- over China's repeated blocking and harassment of Philippine vessels in the West Philippine Sea during their inaugural trilateral maritime talks in Japan.	https://t.me/rybar/66247	2024-12-11T07:33:01-08:00

In the province of Deir ez-Zor, fighting continues between the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and associations led by - Hayat Tahrir al-Sham- (HTS) and -Syrian National Army- (SNA).▪️Pro-HTS militants -Department of Military Operations - completely took control of the city of Deir ez-Zor and the military airport located there. The Kurds did not offer resistance and went to the opposite bank of the Euphrates. ▪️In the Kurdish media, the retreat from previously taken (actually handed over by the SAR armed forces who fled from there) territories was explained by some agreements with the terrorists - Hayat Tahrir al-Sham - concluded through the mediation of the Americans. The condition was the non-entry of pro-Turkish SNA factions into the populated area, in particular such as -Tajamua Ahrar al-Sharqiya-, whose members maternity hospital from these lands. However, soon footage appeared in which they, contrary to promises, show off in Deir ez-Zor.❗The statements about the agreements between HTS and the SDF look remarkable. It is worth noting that reports of ties between the two sides, bypassing Turkish warnings, began to appear long before the fall of the government of Bashar al-Assad. And then the commander-in-chief of the SDF, Mazlum Abdi, officially declares the readiness of the pro-Kurdish administration to cooperate with the new authorities in Damascus, confirming the existence of contacts through the same United States and at the same time criticizing Assad.▪️Amid the ongoing clashes, information appeared about a split in the ranks of the Military Council of Deir ez-Zor - - an American-backed Arab formation within the Syrian Democratic Forces responsible for this province. Some of the fighters, led by commander Abu al-Harith al-Shaaiti, deserted and joined the -legitimate opposition- and -progressive jihadists-, while some remained loyal to the leadership of the SDS. At the same time, the scale of the split is unknown. However, the most interesting thing is just beginning: in order to put the squeeze on the Kurds in Deir ez-Zor, the militants will have to move to the western bank of the Euphrates. There, in addition to oil and gas, there are American military bases in the Conoco and Al-Omar fields. By retreating to these territories, the Syrian Democratic Forces most likely expected to receive support from the US Armed Forces: they say they certainly will not allow the Turkish mercenaries - to brazenly walk around in their zone of interests and control. How it will actually be is difficult to predict. However, given the rapidly changing balance in the country after the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad, the Americans can come to an agreement with -yesterday's extremists- on mutual interests.

A fully expected statement from the Chadian Foreign Ministry, indicating a clear position - Chad has grown, and external forces will protect it can't-. We have already observed a similar narrative during the counter-terrorism operation -Haskanit-. At the same time, the duality of these slogans is also noticeable - there was no news about the withdrawal of the same Hungarian contingent. Of course, his stated goal is to prevent illegal migration, but the fact that Hungarians are in Chad already indicates the indirect presence of the West. Such flexibility in the position of Deby the Younger is associated with the strong influence of Western business in the country and its political institutions. It is considered dangerous for his government to become excessively pro-Russian.

🇨🇳🇺🇸🇵🇭 The situation in the South China Sea remains tense. ...	🇨🇳🇺🇸🇵🇭 The situation in the South China Sea remains tense. Recently it became known about another skirmish between the Filipinos and the Chinese in the disputed waters. Last week, the Chinese coast guard fired a laser six times at a Philippine ship sailing towards Thitu Island, which is controlled by the Philippines, according to authorities in Manila. According to the sailors, the laser hit members of the ship's crew several times in the eyes.▪️Experts interviewed by local media claim that what happened can be considered an armed attack. Let us recall that a mutual defense treaty has been concluded between the Philippines and the United States, implying military assistance from the Americans in the event of aggression against the Philippines. However, the wording mentioned in the document is very vague, so after almost every skirmish one or another expert claims that the time for applying the treaty has come. 🔻In reality, only the Americans will determine the criteria for an armed attack, since the implementation of the text of the document in practice, to a large extent, depends solely on their political will, and not on the prescribed wording. The decision to enter into an open conflict with Beijing over several uninhabited reefs, which, among other things, do not have much strategic value, has not yet matured in Washington and is unlikely to mature in the near future. Therefore, the Americans will continue to limit themselves only to financial assistance and joint exercises with the Philippine military in order to show efforts to contain China.#China #USA #Philippines&nbsp; @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usTelegramAwakening dragon 🐲🇨🇳🇵🇭 With the Chinese exercises, which seem to be taking place, but apparently not, they forgot to talk about another skirmish in the South China Sea.

Only six missiles -Atakms-.▪️According to our data, it was not possible to shoot down all the missiles over the Taganrog Aviation Scientific and Technical Complex, but any damage to the infrastructure was avoided. Only the vehicle equipment in the parking lot was damaged.▪️The launch was carried out from the Zaporozhye region, and the approach time was just under two minutes. This object has recently been under the close attention of Western intelligence, but they failed to achieve their goal.❗️ As for the Peklo drone missile, which is now being talked about, its use was recorded yesterday, but in the Black Sea. One copy was spotted from the Odessa region, and it was shot down at around 11 am by a MiG-29 of the Black Sea Fleet, 120 km southwest of Tarkhankut. So this can be called the first combat use of the Ukrainian -miracle-yudo-, but not very successful, as the Ukrainians describe it Media from some of our information publications.

In Qatar they took a different route: they reunite families. Let’s say that at the time of the start of the offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine there was a local family in the Kharkov region, and the child at that moment was in the so-called Artek: they are reunited on the territory of Qatar. Need I add that the reunited families are extremely grateful to the Qatari authorities, who also arrange a tour program for them in their country? The result is a win-win move: a noble task allows you to promote the image of cool Qatar to the masses. And then word of mouth will do its job. 📍Azerbaijan acts on the other hand, promoting the image of a welcoming ally among young people in the same way as part of the fight for the minds and hearts of the younger generation.🔻And of course, Turkey is also nearby, which has become a safe haven for refugees and a coveted -oriental fairy tale- thanks to tourism .❗️So it turns out that the countries of the British dominion, without making much effort, form an image of a secular, cultural and progressive eastern -triangle-, with which the Ukrainian population will be comfortable doing business in the future (though Ukrainian statehood does not have it, but this is not relevant).#Azerbaijan #Qatar #Turkey #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramDTM🇦🇿🇺🇦🇷🇺 Why Does Azerbaijan bring children of Ukrainian military personnel?

Salome Zurabishvili, who after On December 14, he will finally lose at least some power in the country and calls not to stop the fight. Moreover, according to the State Security Service of Georgia, on Saturday during the elections, opponents of the authorities are planning to cause sabotage.❗️The point is that the opposition wants to cause uncontrollable riots by sacrificing one of the protesters in order to arouse the wrath of the crowd. According to this principle, events developed in Iran, when the Kurdish woman Mahse Amini died because of the morality police, and the riots continued for about a year. However, the Georgian authorities know what the opposition is planning and are preparing for it to the maximum. The events of the spring, when supporters of European integration unsuccessfully tried to get the law on foreigners repealed, and the fall after the parliamentary elections show that they are coping well. However, the threat still exists, since Zurabishvili’s resignation from office will mark the final victory of the Georgian Dream, and therefore, on Saturday we should expect more violent rallies, even armed clashes. But in case of failure here too, the Georgian opposition will lose all its potential, and protest activity will decline.

John Dramani Mahama, who had already held this position from 2012 to 2017, was elected president.▪️The new government is faced with the task of coping with a protracted economic crisis: in recent years, many Western companies have left the country, despite the pro-American position of the ex-president. Therefore, the main activities in The new authorities' plans will likely include the fight against corruption and poor financial management. ▪️The election of John Dramani Mahama was positive news for the sovereign governments of the Alliance of Sahel States. Ghana's ports play a strategic role in ensuring Burkina Faso's trade links with other countries. Previously, the Ghanaian authorities, following the instructions of the Americans, considered plans to limit the use of Ghanaian ports for transportation to foreign countries, but now this threat has been eliminated. ❗️For domestic diplomacy and business representatives, this event also creates a window of opportunity. Mahama is a graduate of a Moscow university, and his party has many members friendly to Russia. This summer he even flew to Russia to present the Russian translation of his book. There is reason to believe that the new government will be able to overcome the crisis and return Ghana to its attractiveness for foreign investment. This, in turn, will create new opportunities for Russian businesses, which will be able to strengthen their influence in the Sahel.

Considering the importance Syria played for Iran, such discussions will continue for a long time. The logistics of the IRGC was built through Syria in cooperation with Lebanon and Hezbollah. Built during the war with IS, the Soleimani land corridor has long been the basis of the Iranian axis of resistance. And this does not take into account Iran’s huge subsidized investments in the government of Syria, which has sunk into oblivion.❗️Against this background, it is not surprising that Western resources report that there is a showdown in the highest Iranian circles over how such a mistake in support was made Syria, which led to disarray in the army and government. For the Iranian leadership, the loss of Syria is a serious blow that weakens the country’s capabilities in the confrontation with Israel - everything Pro-Iranian formations have been withdrawn from Syria. Now there are only militants, Israel and Turkey, and with them - chaos. And if personnel changes begin in Iran in the coming weeks, they will most likely be related to the Syrian events. Now the blade of the guillotine, judging by media reports, has risen above the head of the head of the Quds Force, Ismail Qaani, who is called guilty of allowing this to happen while in Syria.#Syria #Turkey@rybarSupport usایسناجزئیات جلسه غیرعلنی All rights reserved. توضیحاتی از جزئیات جلسه غیرعلنی امروز مجلس با سردار سلامی فرمانده سپاه پرداخت.	https://t.me/rybar/66238	2024-12-11T00:40:10-08:00

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇲🇩🇺🇸 About the USAID program in Moldova for the register of politically exposed persons In Moldova, they intend to create a platform for identifying politically exposed persons within the framework of the American USAID project. The US Agency for International Development is implementing a large-scale five-year project in Moldova - The Moldova Institutional and Structural Reforms Activity. ▪️As part of the project, a proposal was received to optimize the identification of politically exposed persons performing important government functions, as well as to identify risks associated with preventing and combating money laundering and terrorist financing in Moldova. ▪️Politically exposed persons are individuals who perform important government functions in relevant positions. Their family members and other related persons must also be included in the register. ▪️The main task of such a platform is to assess the risks that such persons may potentially bear in the field of money laundering and terrorist financing in their activities. ❗️It would seem that USAID is pursuing the seemingly noble goal of the platform - preventing the fight against illegal activities. However, the current authorities of Moldova can call any cooperation with Russia money laundering or even terrorism. It is obvious that the Americans do not just allocate money for such projects, the real task of which is to place agents of their influence in responsible positions in any sphere of the state. 📌This is especially indicative in the context of the current energy crisis in Moldova and the attempts of unsuccessful authorities to find scapegoats. For example, a scandal is now breaking out that some employees of Moldovagaz subsidiaries have pro-Russian views. What exactly this has to do with the performance of work duties is not very clear, when it is the country’s top leadership that sabotages negotiations with the Russian Federation on gas supplies, which aggravates the crisis in Moldova. 🔻In Moldova, USAID’s favorite strategy in the post-Soviet space is being implemented in full swing: through humanitarian initiatives, in reality, to put under control all strategic areas of the state. After all, the draft platform of politically exposed persons is designed to place their agents of influence and prevent those who may arouse suspicion of the desired political orientation from taking control. #Moldova #USA @pezdicide no chemistry - just factspoint.mdMoldova intends to create a platform for identifying politically exposed persons The USAID program - Institutional and structural reforms in Moldova - invited Moldovan companies in the IT and financial services sector to develop electronic solutions that would improve the identification of politically exposed persons persons in the country.	https://t.me/rybar/66237	2024-12-10T23:43:01-08:00

These love games between the Poles and the Ukrainian authorities are funny if you know that their relationship is still as strong militarily as before. Of course, there are no longer supplies of as many weapons and equipment as there were at the beginning of the Northern Military District. But nevertheless, the Poles supply the Ukrainian Armed Forces with drones, as well as parts for BECs (thanks to the Archangel personnel). ♦️But something else is much more important: everyone has had a question for many months - where are the F-16 fighters that Western countries handed over to the Ukrainians?-. And the answer, as you may have guessed, is simple - they are in Poland.❗️The Minsk-Mazowiecki air base east of Warsaw is now home to 16 F-16 fighters. Of these, 7 have already been repainted to match the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and they are flying to Ukraine to combat drones. Another 6 F-16As of the Dutch Air Force and 3 Danish F-16s, which flew over the other day. Thus, in Poland (but not in Ukraine) there are currently 16 units of Ukrainian F-16s, but only 7 are flying so far. After completing the tasks they return to Minsk Mazowiecki. The rest are still being prepared for operation.♦️This is an interesting situation related to the Poles and Ukrainians. But another important point is that 18 F-16A units of the Dutch Air Force are now fixed in Romania at the Fetesti airbase. Crew training for these fighters has been organized in Romania since last year. Previously there were 6 units, but recently the number has increased. So in total, the Ukrainian Armed Forces now have 34 F-16 fighters. This relates to the question of possible negotiations at the beginning of 2025. The enemy is preparing for the exact opposite. #Denmark #Poland #Russia #UkraineGlobalistics - subscribe to the channel	https://t.me/rybar/66236	2024-12-10T22:12:02-08:00

Western intelligence services are actively helping this, including satellite ones, which share location data with Ukraine our air defense systems, the situation at airfields and other facilities of the RF Armed Forces. Over the past 24 hours, 17 sessions of satellite work in this direction were recorded, of which 11 were in the territory of the Kursk region. Several more sessions were noted in the Belgorod, Voronezh and Bryansk regions. In the classical manner, the enemy pays attention to the airfields of the Russian Aerospace Forces, such as in Kursk and Voronezh, air defense positions, as well as artillery bases as potential targets for attack.

The basis for this was the announced figures of foreign funding for -decolonization- projects in the CIS countries and the subsequent growth of anti-Russian sentiment. As a result, a lot of people with radical and Russophobic views end up in Russia, since there is no input filtering in this regard. The new project, apparently, is designed to eliminate this order of things. There is nothing fundamentally impossible in the technical implementation - a similar system has been introduced in Sheremetyevo for those coming from controlled so-called. Ukraine territory to weed out potentially disloyal elements. In fact, we are talking about seemingly extremely logical things - not to allow migrants who hate our country into Russia. At the same time, there is no point in running ahead of the locomotive: the initiative has not yet been approved, and talk about its effectiveness is early. Yes, and in domestic migration policy there were examples when legislatively introduced mechanisms did not work even several years after adoption. However, recent proposals and laws in this area still give reason to assume that at the highest level there is a certain understanding of the problems of migration policy in recent years and emerging ones from them threats to state sovereignty. #multinationalism #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramAndrey Lugovoi.

It is not yet clear whether this will be supplied as part of the €9 million aid package from the European Peace Fund allocated in June for the modernization of the air defense system in Moldova. Nothing has been heard since then about the fate of these funds. But in Chisinau, lately they have been especially zealous in talking about the discovery of fragments of Russian drones on the territory of the republic. The statements are designed both to create the image of an enemy in the person of the Russian Federation, and to Western officials, from whom the Moldovan authorities are constantly begging for military assistance. 🔻It is curious that a year ago Moldova purchased a French air defense radar for 14 million euros from the state budget. However, we now have to remember the famous radar only in the context of its poor effectiveness. However, as we have seen in recent years, for the Moldovan authorities it is much more important to allocate funds from the state budget or from Western partners specifically for the needs of militarization, and not for the socio-economic sphere. As it turned out, it was more important to acquire non-functioning radars than to negotiate gas supplies in a timely manner. #EU #Moldova @rybarSupport usNoiEU will supply drone interception equipment to the Republic of MoldovaMoldova will receive drone interception equipment from the European Union.

Forwarded From Two Majors🇪🇺What European unity really looks like The 🇳🇱Netherlands government announced on December 9 that it would tighten border controls on its land borders with 🇧🇪Belgium and 🇩🇪Germany. 50 employees have been allocated to work at 840 checkpoints. For six months, random checks of passengers will mainly be carried out on international trains due to a shortage of border guards. Previously, from September 16, 2024, the German Federal Police introduced controls on those entering the country at all land borders for 6 months. New border control rules will affect travelers from 🇩🇰Denmark, 🇳🇱Netherlands, 🇧🇪Belgium, 🇱🇺Luxembourg and 🇫🇷France. Also, during the year, border controls were introduced at their own internal borders by 🇲🇹Malta, 🇸🇮Slovenia and 🇮🇹Italy. In addition, internal border controls in 2025 will operate in 🇸🇮Slovenia (12/22/2024 - 06/21/2025, with Croatia and Hungary), 🇮🇹Italy (12/19/2024 - 06/18/2025 with Slovenia), 🇦🇹Austria (12/11/2024 - 11/05/2025 with Hungary and Slovenia), 🇳🇱Netherlands (09/12/2024 - 08/06/2025 (with Slovakia and the Czech Republic), 🇳🇴Norway (12/11/2024 - 11/05/2025 (all land, air and sea borders), 🇩🇰 Denmark (12/11/2024 - 11/05/2025 all internal borders, as well as land and maritime boundaries with Germany), 🇫🇷France (01.11.2024 - 30.04.2025 (with Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, the Swiss Confederation, Italy and Spain, including maritime) and 🇸🇪Sweden (11.12.2024 - 05.11.2025 all internal borders).✨When it comes to their own benefit and security, Europeans begin to scatter in different corners.

The target will be an aerial target missile fired from a C-17A military transport aircraft.▪️Control will be provided by measurement complex ships from the US Department of Transportation reserve fleet and a C-11B optical tracking laboratory aircraft. Also in the area will be the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USS Milius.▪️This will be the first test of the new Aegis Guam missile defense system as part of the Pentagon's program to protect the Mariana Islands. The previous time, the Americans carried out similar launches at the end of March at a training ground in Hawaii. Against the backdrop of a gradual increase in tension in the Asia-Pacific region, it is not difficult to guess that the deployed system is primarily directed against the PRC. Moreover, back in 2023, the United States planned to literally stuff Guam with missile defense and air defense systems. And on a more global level, this is part of the strategy to deploy similar facilities around the world, which Washington has been adhering to since the withdrawal from the ABM Treaty. In particular, within its framework, a similar Aegis system was recently put into operation in Poland near the Kaliningrad region.

The decision was made by the German Migration Department, where they explained that the situation in Syria is confusing and that will happen there politically is too difficult to predict. Currently, more than 47 thousand applications from Syrians. The department also said that the latest events in their country will not affect asylum decisions that have already been made. The political debate about whether Syrians should stay in Germany began at the same time as the crisis. Several deputies from the CDU party, which includes the main candidate for the post of German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, immediately spoke out in favor of returning refugees back to their homeland. At the same time, politicians from the Greens and the party of the current SPD chancellor called for restraint due to the unclear situation. It is obvious that this topic will occupy an important place in the election debates of German politicians: it is quite convenient to cover up more serious problems within the country, and at the same time beneficial play on the mood of the electorate.🔻However, the measure taken by the German government will obviously not save the situation. After all, when asking for asylum, you can lose your passport and provide false documents - Germany will not be able to completely or even half protect itself from the next wave of Syrians. It is also worth understanding that, according to official data alone, at least 1.5 million people are expected to flee from Syria - and it is quite obvious that most of them will try to break through to Europe. Namely, in Germany, a large diaspora of Syrians has settled quite firmly and long ago - this is the largest group in the country after the Ukrainians, only officially there are about 900 thousand of them in the country. Therefore, it is logical that many of the fugitives will want to join their brothers, and they will be happy to help them .#Germany #Syria #migrants @rybar together with @pl_syrenkaSupport usSpiegelAlle Verfahren ausgesetzt – Bamf stoppt Entscheidung über Asylanträge von SyrernDas Bundesamt für Migration und Flüchtlinge bearbeitet bis auf Weiteres keine Asylanträge von Syrerinnen und Syrern.

The targets were objects in several provinces at once, including those controlled by the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in the northeast of the country, which had not happened before.▪️The hits were on military research centers in the vicinity of the Syrian capital Damascus and the suburbs of Qudsaya . Fires broke out, which were soon extinguished by local services.▪️Marine infrastructure and equipment in the port of Latakia were attacked. According to Israeli media, ships of unknown destination on the roadstead also came under attack, but this information has not yet been confirmed.▪️ Explosions occurred at the Al-Shayrat airbase in Homs province, which the Israelis have repeatedly struck. Apparently, there the IDF tried to destroy the remnants of the Syrian Air Force, air defense systems and infrastructure.▪️In territories controlled by Kurdish forces in the provinces of Ar-Raqqa and Al-Hasakah, the Israelis hit facilities previously used by the troops of the overthrown government of Bashar al-Assad.🔻As we wrote, on At the moment, the Israelis will do everything possible to ensure that the weapons and ammunition of the SAA, which has sunk into oblivion, do not fall into into the hands of the militants to the new authorities formed by the -legal opposition-. This can explain the attacks in the zone of control of the SDF, which for the time being coexisted with the enclaves of the Syrian Armed Forces: there is a considerable probability that the hand of the Syrian revolution in the person of the pro-Turkish Syrian National Army (SNA) will reach there too. The Israeli Air Force will continue to attack military warehouses, air defense elements, airfields and research centers in order to completely deprive the militants of the legacy of the SAA, which could threaten Israel or be resold to third parties. At the same time, the matter will not be limited to strikes alone, and after their completion, the IDF units that entered El Quneitra will not be in a hurry to leave. After all, if previously this kind of activity was justified by the presence of Iranian-backed forces in the region, now progressive jihadists will act as a punching bag.

Ukraine as a state entity. In our opinion, the best answer to the question is two recent news: ▪️The Commissioner of the Kiev... 🇺🇸🇺🇦 The American administration continues to insist on expanding mobilization by the Kyiv regime: the State Department stated that if the lower conscription limit is reduced to 18 years, the United States and its allies are ready -to fully train and equip all recruits-.Behind such formulations are hidden conditions to continue or expand military assistance to the Kyiv regime. Ukrainian ruling circles understand this and are already hinting at the possibility of reducing the mobilization threshold from the current 25 years to 20 years. On the one hand, such a step will lead to a certain influx of manpower and will improve the position of the Armed Forces of Ukraine at the front, especially in terms of the ratio of numbers with the Russian Armed Forces. However, the solution also has pitfalls: ▪️Due to the long-standing demographic problems of young people in the so-called. Ukraine doesn’t have so much - on the age pyramid, there is a noticeable strong subsidence in this category. It is unlikely that it will be possible to overwhelm the combat formations of Ukrainian formations with 18-25 year olds.▪️In the current realities, a large-scale conscription of yesterday's schoolchildren and students is quite capable of leading to a social explosion in the so-called. Ukraine, especially against the backdrop of the practice of busification. A significant number of them themselves will prefer to hide until the last moment, even in the Chernobyl exclusion zone.▪️Finally, the motivation of the young recruits abducted by the TCC will be appropriate. If in 2022 the patriotic impulse inflated by the Kyiv regime was at work, now, after almost three years of hostilities, morale is at a different level. Be that as it may, a possible reduction in the mobilization age by the so-called Ukraine does not bode well for us, much less for the Ukrainian population, which will simply be finished off with its already sad demographics. In general, an interesting picture is emerging: at the beginning of the Northern Military District, statements that the West would fight to the last Ukrainian were often perceived as propaganda or even conspiracy theories . Three years later, in the United States they talk about this almost in plain text. #USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport usWashington PostAmid U.S. pressure, Ukraine starts thinking about drafting 18-year-oldsAs Russia gains ground on the battlefield in high-attrition combat, Zelensky is facing increased pressure to deploy younger people to the front lines.	https://t.me/rybar/66211	2024-12-10T01:33:00-08:00

Among the numerous tasks of the performer, there is also a requirement to develop methods and approaches for attracting the local population to USAID programs.❗️ In fact, such a program legalizes the recruitment of local personnel and their collection of all kinds of information, which, under the guise of -reforming- the cultural and educational sphere of Armenia, will simply put it under the control of the Americans with the efficiency criteria they developed. Such programs are a favorite strategy of USAID, which allows them to gain access to the local environment and limit the sovereignty of the country. Moreover, in Armenia the installation of agents of American influence in the government is already in full swing, so that all American innovations will not find any resistance in the Armenian political environment.

They even filmed several videos from Menbij, declaring control over it.▪️But a few hours later, the Syrian Democratic Forces launched a counterattack with the support of their artillery and knocked out the pro-Turkish proxies from most of Menbij.▪️Currently, fighting for the city and surrounding villages and suburbs continue, and it is premature to talk about control of any of the warring parties.❗️Special attention One should pay attention to the kind of assistance Turkey provides to terrorists under its control. On December 8 alone, 5 UAVs - Akıncı - and at least 7 drones - Bayraktar - from different air bases in Turkey were recorded over Menbij and the surrounding area. Several air strikes were carried out from drones with MAM guided bombs according to the supporters of the Kurds. And then the drones provided guidance to the F-16C/D fighters on three SDS armored vehicles. And that’s not all. Artillery units of the Turkish Armed Forces were deployed to the border with Syria and carried out 12 strikes against the Kurds. This intensity confirms the theory that the Turks may soon launch a new operation against the SDF.
