The situation has become so tense that daily incidents with migrants have become commonplace. At the same time, it is one thing to talk about one high-profile incident and another to draw conclusions based on more detailed data throughout the country. In this regard, it was interesting to analyze the statistics of the Prosecutor General’s Office for 2024 on the crime situation in Russia, namely crimes committed by foreigners.▪️ Their total number, compared to the nine months of 2023, decreased by 3.1% and amounted to 30&nbsp;231 crimes. Although there is one nuance: the number of migrants themselves who committed these crimes decreased by 4.3% (22&nbsp;762).❗️It is interesting that there are 7,469 fewer persons involved than the crimes they committed. An extraordinary difference, isn't it? It is due to a special counting system in the field of drug trafficking. Bookmarks, which have long become a meme, are classified as a separate independent crime. They caught the courier, found 20 packages of bookmarks on him and received 20 crimes for one person. And 5&nbsp;566 such sales were identified.▪️Serious crimes increased by 19.7% - 6&nbsp;456, but the number of especially serious crimes decreased by 21.1% - 6,548 crimes. This includes 1,209 corruption crimes, and 88 crimes of an extremist nature.▪️The fact of document falsification and corruption should be considered important from the point of view of the migration problem. Fraud with documents increased by 14.6% (from 4&nbsp;520 to 5&nbsp;181), and economic crimes by 23.5% (from 1&nbsp;790 to 2&nbsp;211).▪️Another worrying position can be called an increase of 2 % of crimes against sexual integrity - 861 cases. Compared to 2023, there are 9 more rapes and 32 more indecent assaults. ❗️Despite the low numbers in the increase, these types of incidents cause a large reaction among residents, and their increase should be of serious concern to security forces.▪️In other categories, such as property damage (i.e. theft, robberies, robberies) and attempts on life and murders, there is a decrease of 5.8%, which significantly corrected the statistics. Summarizing the statistical data, it should be noted that these are only numbers that are a dry and not always reliable indicator of the real situation. We cannot exclude the human factor, the corruption component and the elementary impossibility of keeping track of everything. Even now, when the general figures show a decrease in the number of crimes among foreigners, a closer examination reveals those pain points that we have been paying attention to for a long time.➖Cases of forgery of documents grew by a large percentage. This is one of the main factors of the current problem, due to which shadow migration has become a routine and the number of illegal immigrants has increased hundreds of times.➖Corruption, namely the giving of bribes to officials, has not disappeared anywhere. Bribery and nepotism have led to increased influence of ethnic communities in Russia and, as a result, complicity and concealment on the part of some security officials and politicians have become the norm.➖And, of course, it is worth remembering the bureaucratic component. One of the main criteria for a successful service was and is - correct reports - in which a positive trend in any issue should be visible from year to year. Taken together, all this led to many years of indifference to the problem that was growing like a snowball, to which was added the high activity of Western intelligence services and the non-profit organizations they finance.

But this is the meaning of USAID’s work. Under the guise of humanitarian, educational, cultural, and so on programs, the American organization gains access to almost all spheres of the state. In this case, the Americans ask their Tajik colleagues to assist in improving the educational program for primary school, since the current LTA project ends in September next year. Among other questions, the Americans asked one very interesting question: what are the entry points into the educational system of Tajikistan in the development of emotional intelligence and soft skills (flexibility)? Why is this important to Americans? Psychological and mental training of fragile minds from an early age will ensure more effective cultivation of the personnel Americans need, imbued with the necessary thoughts and ideas.❗️The sphere of education plays one of the key roles in strengthening influence in a particular state. Therefore, the US pays close attention to this. In just 15-20 years, there will be a new generation in Tajikistan.

The term -Central Asia- will be replaced by -Turkestan- in order to strengthen national identity among future generations. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan noted that work will be carried out shoulder to shoulder with the countries of the region to make the coming period the era of the Turks within the framework of the vision of the Turkish Century. in the Organization of Turkic States. According to Turkish experts, these changes are part of a broader strategy to strengthen ties and unity in the Turkic world, including the creation of a common history, literature, maps and alphabet.📌 In past centuries, the region of Central Asia was called something like the same . During the time of the Russian Empire, there was a Turkestan Governor-General, and only in the 20s of the last century the term -Central Asia- came into use. And there seems to be nothing sacred in this, something like changing Turkey to Türkiye - to amuse one’s vanity. However, the general situation in which the Turks have significantly accelerated the integration of the countries of Central Asia into the UTC looks indicative. After all, they call the region -Turkestan- not with good intentions, the Turkish authorities are seeking to restore imaginary greatness by integrating the region into the pan-Turkic project of the UTC.❗️And the Organization of Turkic States , created under the control of British curators and acting in their interests, acts as an ideal springboard for uniting these peoples into one supranational bloc. True, with such appetites, the Turks will soon peep not only at Central Asia, or even look, they will begin to argue with Ukrainian historians about who filled up the Black Sea and dug up the Crimean mountains.

Now it’s time for another exchange of pleasantries.▪️The head of MI5 counterintelligence, Ken McCallum, presented a new report on threats to national security, which traditionally included a place for Russia. He stated that the Russian GRU has set itself the task of creating -permanent chaos on the streets of Great Britain and Europe-. According to him, military intelligence officers committed - arson, sabotage and more dangerous actions carried out with increasing recklessness - in the UK after London supported the Kiev regime in 2022. In fact, all these statements are about Moscow's attempts to create chaos on the streets Europe is nothing more than a hint of the recent anti-migrant protests in the UK. During the unrest, the authorities regularly explained to the population that radical sentiments were fueled from abroad. Then the -Russian trace- became the main topic of several articles on the pages of British publications, and the head of MI6 Richard Darlove accused Russia of waging a -gray war-.🔻Well, British leaders should thank fate for the increase in tension in bilateral relations between Moscow and London.

The leader of the movement, Bagrat Galstanyan, demanded that criminal cases be opened against high-ranking officials, including Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, for complicity in genocide and ethnic cleansing in Artsakh.▪️The second demand of the protest is the initiation of a criminal case against the decision of the Constitutional Court, according to which the provisions of the Declaration of independence were declared illegal. ▪️During the protest, claims were also made against the authorities about the lack of protection for Armenians who are in Azerbaijani prisons. The protesters also tried to carry a doll in the shape of Pashinyan on a bicycle to the Prosecutor General’s Office building, symbolizing the surrender of Artsakh. However, the police constantly tried to push the protesters away from the Prosecutor General's Office building. There are no data on arrests. 🔻The protest movement in Armenia has clearly lost the momentum that it had in the spring against the backdrop of the surrender of villages in the Tavush region to Azerbaijan. The Sacred Struggle movement immediately confused many observers with the lack of a clear program, which has not yet appeared. At the same time, its leader Bagrat Galstanyan previously announced large rallies in the fall, but so far everything is clearly not going according to plan.

After the publication of the analysis of what is happening in the Seversky direction, questions like -Why refute reports about the capture of villages if this is an element of information warfare?- They say that the enemy himself is ready to believe in them loss, and there is no need to interfere with him. Alas, everything works a little differently here. A false report about the capture of a particular location not only misinforms the higher command and contributes to making erroneous decisions, but in addition also cuts off one’s own combat capabilities.📌 First of all, this applies to work with large calibers, such as FAB with UMPC. If we paint over the conditional Verkhnekamenskoye without establishing real control, then an airstrike on targets inside the village from above simply does not agree. Indeed, why attack the village, which on the map is already our rear? But no one removed the tasks of moving further to Seversk, so the troops have to catch up with false reports and liberate what is already ours on paper. But this already has to be done without the use of -large calibers- for the same destruction of enemy strongholds.❗️ That is, such -false-reports lead to a decrease in the ability to inflict fire damage in the interests of the advancing group. And this, in turn, entails losses of personnel and equipment. Which, contrary to the beliefs of some people, tend to end very quickly if used thoughtlessly. Therefore, comrades who justify such situations with -competent IPsO- are somewhat in a parallel world. The realities are still completely different, and at the cost of fraudulent reports about successes are the lives of our people.

American officials are frustrated that they have been repeatedly caught off guard by Israeli military actions in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon, and they are trying to prevent further escalation. At the same time, in the United States there is no information about the time and purpose of the proposed strike, and in Washington they expected to receive this data during the visit of Defense Minister Galant, which was postponed at the request of Netanyahu.🔻Sounds good, doesn’t it? Especially after the media trumpeted that the Israelis notified the United States of the planned assassination of Hassan Nasrallah and the start of an operation in Lebanon. And before that, the Israeli leadership tells the Americans more than enough about the progress of other events in the Gaza Strip. And the Pentagon was directly involved in planning the response to the Iranian attacks. Do you think why the head of the Central Command, Michael Kurilla, came to Israel?

🔁 As military correspondent Simonov and Rybar write, the reason ...	Forwarded From Colonelcassad (Boris Rozhin)As military correspondent Simonov and Rybar write, the reason for the excessive shading of the map on the Seversky ledge lies in incorrect reports from the field on the basis of which reports were given about the complete control of Verkhnekamensky. In fact, this is a remake of the situation in 2022, when there were premature reports about the release of Popasnaya, who was stormed for a long time. Now such cases have become rare, but nevertheless they still occur. The reduction in such episodes was a consequence of the competent policy of the Russian Ministry of Defense with the delay in publication of the liberation of settlements only after the completion of cleansing and establishment of full control, even several days after they were declared captured on the Internet. Advancement in these areas of the Seversky salient is taking place this is confirmed by objective enemy control, but is not as impressive as on published maps. The flag in Grigorovka confirms the very fact of entering the ruins of the village (in which the enemy, apparently, was not present at all), but there is no complete control there yet, so rapid throws through Grigorovka to the northeastern outskirts of Seversk are not yet relevant. But only for now. The liberation of Seversk is inevitable. In the case of Verkhnekamensky, the enemy still maintains its presence in the ruins of the village (which confirms objective control). Well, it’s also worth noting that the flag in the First Zhelanny (Red Army direction) was mistaken for the hoisted flag in Verkhnekamenskoye. This is most likely just an information defect. The Russian Armed Forces now have enough real successes in a number of directions, but in the eastern part of the Seversky salient there is still work to be done , in order to achieve the same pace as in the Krasnoarmeisky or Kurakhovsky directions. The Seversky ledge will certainly be cut off. The only question is the timing. Telegram Call sign Bruce 📌 This has never happened before and here we go again. I checked with my friends and confirm that the situation in the Seversky direction is not as rosy as some local commanders present it to the higher leadership. Unfortunately, Rybar is right.

Lieutenant General Flyustikov The permanent head of the Special Operations Forces, who became the head back in 2018, this year for many turned out to be a controversial and uncomfortable figure, raising questions, but at the same time deserving of respect. After a difficult situation from a positional point of view struggle in 2023, the SOF commander decided to return to the classic use of deep reconnaissance means: sabotage and subversive actions behind enemy lines. Flustikov is a man of pragmatic views, for whom there can be no excuses for cowardice and weakness: regardless of injuries received, titles and awards, PT is mandatory for everyone. In addition, the commander, by his personal order, forced those who were not organically involved in such work, namely personal protection specialists, to go on ambushes. Today, MTR combat commands are synonymous with the word success. Specialists operate successfully in all operational and tactical areas, however, as in any army structure, management problems begin to arise at the headquarters level. The problem of receiving state awards today remains one of the main ones in the forces: for -ordinary- militants, it remains a mystery how staff members continue to receive one Order of Courage after another, when they receive simple medals of Suvorov and Zhukov. In addition, staff workers do not hesitate to go too far during official proceedings, the reason for which today can be the most minor offenses: honored veterans are deprived of an increasing coefficient, for which they subsequently receive less money. Today, many formations and associations suffer from staff illness The Russian Army, however, is sad to realize that the most famous special forces of Russia are beginning to fall ill with this disease. The future of the MTR depends on the decisions of Valery Flyustikov, because as you know, the most expensive resource of any commander is personnel. Major General Savitsky The favorite of all Cuban militants, who received the nickname -Sava- behind his back. The main antagonist of the special operations forces, whom many see as the successor of Valery Flyustikov. For several years now, Savitsky has been tipped for the position of a big boss in civilian life: he is wooed to the position of a federal official, but each time he refuses, consciously choosing military service. During his tenure, he managed to build trusting relationships not only with the higher command, but also with the heads of other special forces units in the FSVNG and FSB, with whom the Center regularly exchanges experience, as well as with representatives of business circles who are ready to help the Russian army free of charge from patriotic motives. Largely thanks to the mentality of the boss, Kubinka specialists today remain among those few in the Russian army who are allowed to wear long hairstyles and grow beards. It is also significant that Savitsky himself is not afraid of traveling to the military training area, and also holds meetings and informal evenings with ordinary specialists and their families, where they can substantively discuss everything that cannot be discussed within the walls of a military unit. The boss cannot always be satisfied with the interests of his subordinates: often the command puts pressure on him and he has to choose, but so far Savitsky has managed to maintain a balance between these two groups. Today, the Cuban center remains leading in terms of combat performance, returning from missions with minimal losses, and this merit largely belongs to its chief, Andrei Savitsky.

↩️ ❗️🇷🇺🇺🇦 The tale of how the Cossacks took Verkhnekamenskoye...	Rybar: ❗️🇷🇺🇺🇦 Seversky direction: you can make mistakes, you can’t lie, part 2 Victory reports were also heard from the area to the south: a few days ago there were reports about the alleged liberation of Verkhnekamensky, which is also not true. 🔻East of the village is... ❗️🇷🇺🇺🇦 The tale of how the Cossacks took Verkhnekamenskoye -since many questions arise in connection with our reports about the incorrect and incorrect presentation of information about events in the Seversky direction, we decided to analyze in detail a peculiar -media crime- , which was committed in the interests of units advancing on Verkhnekamenskoye. The fact is that first there was a report from the Ministry of Defense on the clearing of the settlement, and then a report from Izvestia appeared as confirmation. But this report is not proof that the settlement is under the control of Russian troops. (Believe me, we would be the first to really rejoice at this moment and are ready to admit that this is not so if any objective facts of control appear). As far as we know, Verkhnekamenskoye is in the zone of responsibility of the Cossacks of the 6th Guards Motorized Rifle Brigade, and it is they who are responsible for the conduct of actions in this area and the success (as well as failure) of certain assault actions.🔻What’s wrong with the report - Izvestia -?▪️The footage from the car was obviously filmed on territory controlled by the Russian Armed Forces and is not of great value. Judging by the speed of movement and the bushes outside the window, this is not Verkhnekamensk at all. ▪️At 0.13 - resource map of Lostarmour, Verkhnekamenskoye -colored over - according to the statement of the Ministry of Defense some time ago, but in complete isolation from the existing objective control personnel in this area. To the south on the same screen, by the way, the Recess is shown, which is not under the control of the RF Armed Forces, and at the moment the same Lostarmour is -painted-. With Grigorovka it’s a different story - in the shown section of the map it is not painted over, but is now under the control of the RF Armed Forces.▪️At 0.56 - a strike on the ruins of the Seversky Dolomite Plant, which has been regularly hit almost from the very beginning of the Northern Military District. And it is extremely unlikely that this particular strike has anything to do with the fighting near Verkhnekamensky. ▪️Frames from 1.13, according to which the journalists had already taken a walk to Verkhnekamenskoye - the author of the report himself posted with a caption about the Desired Second back on October 7. There is a separate report on this on the Izvestia website. ▪️Next, at 1.16, there is another frame with the Russian flag, and it also has nothing to do with Verkhnekamensky. This is filming from the Russian Ministry of Defense from Desired First. Coordinates: 48.0751, 37.42584 ▪️And only at the very end, at 1.25, the Russian flag is clearly visible on a house on the western outskirts of Verkhnekamensky. However, the banner is not installed on some kind of flagshot, but simply lies on the roof, obviously dropped there from a drone, and not installed there by hand. Coordinates: 48.86256890414785, 38.16919919278926 ❗️In general, if we consider only this individual case concerning Verkhnekamensky, we can see how, at first, an incorrect report from the field forms an incorrect idea of ​​the leadership of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation about what is happening at the front. And then unprofessional military correspondents and journalists, acting in the interests of liars, film low-quality reports that do not deal with reality at all.📌 The Rybar team may admit that they are mistaken in their judgments. Well, if this is so, we would be happy to see footage of real control that confirms that Russian troops have established stable control over Verkhnekamensky. And the words that this is impossible, will endanger the fighters operating in this direction, believe me, are definitely not an excuse for our groups that publish online footage of the actions of the East and Center troop groups, which are the most effective to date based on successes on the front line. Well, a trend about effectiveness has appeared, but, alas, there is no actual effectiveness in certain areas.

On October 3, 2024, the International Armored Group (IAG) consortium announced the opening in 🇧🇬 of an enterprise in Bulgaria for the production of armored personnel carriers, tactical vehicles and specialized vehicles for military, law enforcement and civilian use The construction of the enterprise began on August 30, 2023 near the city of Burgas. At the moment, a presentation of the enterprise has already taken place before representatives of military and law enforcement agencies. It is planned to establish production of a new model of the 8-wheeled armored fighting vehicle RILA 8×8 (RILA 8×8 IFV), which will enter service with the Bulgarian Armed Forces. In addition, the company's products include a light reconnaissance vehicle (LRV), a GUARDIAN armored personnel carrier, an armored rescue vehicle SENTINEL (ARV), etc., which will be supplied to the armed forces of EU and NATO countries against the background of the growing need to build up the military power of Western countries.✨ A typical example of how the Russian threat brings money to transnational corporations and corrupt Western bureaucrats. However, such marketing and the growing appetites of military departments and companies lead to tense relations with Russia, which is fraught with a transition to uncontrollable processes.

Simply put, the Afghan factor, namely imaginary problems with terrorists and a long humanitarian and social crisis, create convenient conditions for lobbying their services to the countries of the region. And on October 8, a meeting was held between the Special Representative of the President of Uzbekistan for Afghanistan, Ismatulla Irgashev, and the head of the EU delegation in Tashkent, Toivo Klaar, within the framework of cooperation between the parties. The head of the EU Delegation noted the need to continue regular bilateral contacts to coordinate efforts in the Afghan direction and highly appreciated the efforts of the Uzbek authorities to solve the Afghan problem.📌 The collective West is trying to coerce the authorities of the countries of Central Asia not only through military methods. Elementary economic and political interaction, embellished with beautiful words, is also in use. You convey how difficult the situation in Afghanistan is and what security threats this all creates in the region and then offer the Central Asian republics closer cooperation in solving these essentially artificial problems.#Afghanistan# EU #Uzbekistan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64287	2024-10-09T07:42:01-07:00

I checked with my friends and confirm that the situation in the Seversky direction is not as rosy as some local commanders present it to the higher leadership. Unfortunately, Rybar is right. The situation there is very difficult. There is progress in some areas, but not as much as they say. Due to unreliable reports, management then makes wrong decisions. Let me remember the recent Stelmakhovka in the Kupyansky area. On the Internet and reports, everyone took it, but I contact the guys on the ground - the battles are still going on. I wrote about this. Miracles, right? One cannot allow a misinterpretation of the situation at the front. Taking credit for non-existent victories directly affects the lives of our guys. They then run to the attack to catch up with the reports. And at the highest headquarters they are planning further actions based on what does not yet exist.

🖼 🇸🇩 The situation in Sudan: the offensive of the armed forces...	🇸🇩 The situation in Sudan: the offensive of the armed forces in Khartoum as of October 9, 2024. The decrease in military activity that we observed due to the rainy season is fading away. Across the entire front, there is an intensification of both the Rapid Reaction Forces of the rebel General Hamedti and the country's armed forces.▪️In the capital of the country, Khartoum, the army went on the offensive from Omdurman. Through the bridge connecting the two cities, a large column of equipment was able to advance up to three kilometers in depth, breaking through to the blockaded parts of the country's general headquarters. In addition, aviation is actively helping in the offensive, carrying out strikes throughout Khartoum. In response, the RRF fired at Karari and tried once again to attack the blockaded parts of the armed forces. They did not achieve any success in this direction.▪️In the west of the country in El Fasher, the rebels were successful: they managed to occupy several blocks of the city. They carried out pogroms in the occupied territories, destroying and burning houses. In response, Sudanese aviation attacked them, including using the Il-76 transport aircraft for this purpose. The success of the attackers is associated with a huge numerical superiority. RRF recruit militants from controlled territories. More than two hundred people were recruited from El Geneina alone. At the same time, one of the commanders of the advancing rebels was killed during the fighting.❗️An interesting incident occurred in a deserted, uncontested zone. On October 2, a convoy of armed forces passing to the west of the country came under attack by the rebels. During the bloody battles, as stated by the RRF, they managed to destroy about a hundred army vehicles. There were also battles along the Chadian-Sudanese border, where the RRF attacked the army-controlled city of Kalbus, but were unsuccessful.▪️Fighting continued on the Sennar salient -, mainly in the area of ​​​​the city of Dinder, which changed hands several times, but is currently controlled by the armed forces. The RRF also tried once again to carry out an offensive at El Obeid, but without apparent success. Meanwhile, the government air force carried out a raid on Nyala airport, controlled by the rebels. The reason was the landing of unknown planes, presumably from the UAE. The extent of the damage is unknown, but explosions were recorded throughout the harbor.🔻Amid ongoing fighting, Sudanese President Fattah al-Burhan visited the capital of South Sudan, where he met with the local president. The topic of discussion was the occupation of oil-bearing areas belonging to Juba by the SBR. Burhan intends to take advantage of this to unite around a common enemy and establish supply routes. While the leaders of the RRF were busy participating in the Geneva Peace Conference under the patronage of the United States, in Beijing the Sudanese authorities continued to seek support from both the Chinese and other regional players. At the moment, there is no end in sight to the war, but as recent events show, the world community is increasingly leaning towards Burhan.

Due to the active use of UAVs by the enemy and the lack of cover in the required quantity, the attack is akin to a one-way ticket. Moreover, their scenario has not changed for a long time: armored groups of the Russian Armed Forces are moving from the direction of Verkhnekamenka or Zolotarevka, landing troops in the east of the strong point . The soldiers find themselves in open, broken trenches, coming under artillery and UAV attacks: the assault groups die, and the remnants are captured or killed by the enemy.❗️Over the past months, this has happened not once or twice. Such unconditional clumsy tactics, which do not change even after all the significant losses in people and equipment, can be safely called sabotage. Verkhnekamenskoye itself is also under the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces - it cannot be taken without a successful assault on the heights to the north and south, which it still occupies enemy. The Russian flag on the western outskirts of the village, footage of which was replicated on the Internet, was in fact simply dropped from a drone, while other video evidence was passed off as footage from the DPR. 🔻On the southern front of the Seversky direction in the area of ​​Sporny and Ivano-Daryevka, the real advance of Russian troops was still recorded. However, it occurs in forest belts without pompous statements and is confirmed mainly by footage of objective control by the enemy. The situation is different with Vyemka and the railway station of the same name, also allegedly liberated in accordance with previous statements of the Ministry of Defense. Judging by the videos popping up on the Internet from both sides, the stopping point is still occupied by the enemy, and Russian troops are operating on the southern edge of the Zmeiny Yar nature reserve and the heights to the east. That is, there is no talk of any capture of the village. ❗️In general, in almost all the areas mentioned, the situation remains complex and tense. Reports of great successes are a hoax and a banal deception of the leadership, which obviously affects the credibility of such reports. But for what purpose near Verkhnekamensky and Belogorovka, routine attacks continue month after month with the expenditure of not at all infinite personnel is a question for the authorized structures. Somehow there are too many lies for so many errors.

Today's video of arming the flag on the outskirts of Grigorovka is provided as evidence. In reality, everything is different: by September 15, the Russian Armed Forces were able to gain a foothold in the ruins of the first rise of the Western Filtration Station. A group of several fighters moved through a narrow strip of greenery on the southern bank of the Seversky Donets and planted the same flag, after which they retreated to their original positions.❗️There is no talk of any control over this area yet. The southern bank of the Seversky Donets is cut up by gullies, ravines and hundreds of craters, therefore, the passage for equipment is extremely limited, especially given the advantage of the APU in the UAV in the direction. There are several enemy mortar crews and UAV operators operating in the forest to the north. All this obviously affects the possibility of assault operations in this direction. Belogorovka itself, which has already become synonymous with a cemetery, is under the complete control of Ukrainian formations. Russian attack aircraft can reach single buildings on the eastern outskirts of a populated area, but this can often be called a one-way route. In fact, no one controls the ruins of the Popasnyansky district water canal (the second rise of the Western Filtration Station), since they are located in the lowlands relative to the chalk mountain - the dominant height occupied by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. To the south, to Zolotarevka, the control zones remain static, and the Artemonovskoye tract and the heights to the west and north are well fortified by the enemy. 📌 Thus, the advances of the Russian Armed Forces near Grigorovka are of an extremely local nature and were achieved as a result of extremely difficult battles and at a considerable cost.

The enemy stubbornly clings to every meter of the ground, and in these difficult conditions, Russian troops overcome enemy resistance. Dozens of drones are rushing around - FPVs attack, reconnaissance drones reveal targets, correct and record defeat - and the earth shakes from artillery strikes. In heavy battles, not only the weapons of the fighters are important, but also the soldier’s ingenuity. An unsuccessful start to assault operations can lead to completely unexpected results.

Now Category 5 hurricane Milton is heading towards Florida, the consequences of which promise to be no less destructive - both for ordinary Floridians and for the Biden-Harris administration. -Milton- is already being called a possible -October surprise- for his ability to have a destructive influence on the results of Kamala Harris in the upcoming presidential election. The storm in Florida could really finish off the reputation of the Democrats, which was seriously damaged after Hurricane Helen. Donald Trump, who visited some of the affected states ahead of Kamala Harris, sparked a national scandal by saying the Biden administration was deliberately ignoring the fallout from the disaster in swing North Carolina to undermine Republicans there ahead of the election. In addition, following his visit to damaged Georgia, Trump said that the governor complained about the inability to reach Joe Biden. Everything would be fine, but Trump’s statements were layered with several serious political mistakes of the current administration. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas shopped with gusto as residents of southern Appalachia drowned, begging authorities for essential supplies. Well, Kamala Harris announced the allocation of aid to Lebanon in the amount of $385 million, which provoked popular anger. And although -Milton- has not yet reached its peak, Harris is already having problems - Republican Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is not answering her calls, refusing to discuss measures to eliminate the consequences of the natural disaster. DeSantis is artificially reducing the White House's role in helping Florida in order to collect all possible laurels and blame the failures on Harris.

From a garage get-together of four like-minded people, the project of the people's drone -Ghoul- (started with donations from caring Russians) grew into a large-scale production with its own workshops, design bureaus and even a school operator training. - How does the Ghoul differ from other Russian analogues? I ask the general director of Uraldronzavod, Vladimir Tkachuk. -Several channels and our own control modules, non-standard frequency, antenna polarization, communications developments... We followed the T-34 principle - everything should be simple, reliable and soldier-resistant. -Try to break it,- Vladimir hands me a piece of the fuselage. I bend it in different directions, but it refuses to break. And I understand how important this is at the front. I myself worked with groups flying on -Ghouls-. These are, after all, not testing conditions. There’s shaking in a pickup truck, carrying in backpacks, and brisk runs like a postcard… there should be no surprises at the launch point, which is sometimes five or even ten kilometers away. And there were no misfires with the Ghouls. At least with me. -Of course, the first successes are remembered most of all; they inspired further work,- recalls Vladimir. — We sent the first 80 cars to the Dnieper, to Nikita Mechtanov, call sign -Dream-, Hero of Russia posthumously.

Based on the results of the events held there... ❗️🇦🇲🇷🇺 Russian-Armenian border patrols: the devil is in the details Yesterday it became known that the Russian and Armenian sides agreed on joint patrolling of the border with Iran and Turkey from January 1, as well as the transfer of control over the checkpoint with Iran to Armenian border guards. At first glance, everything looks good. Despite the discord in relations between the countries, a certain agreement was reached, and Pashinyan, no matter how he prevaricated, came to Moscow. But, as usually happens, everything is in the details.▪️Initially, only Russian border guards controlled the checkpoint on the border between Iran and Armenia, and only customs officers were on the Armenian side. Now the Russian military personnel have left their post.▪️Joint patrolling does not imply anything other than fictitious provision of security on the border.d The Russian contingent is actually deprived of the powers that they had before.▪️In addition, the total number of personnel of the Russian Armed Forces in Armenia has been reduced by as much as 50%. Russian units left several settlements, such as Goris, Sisian and Yeraskh, a long time ago.▪️Russian radar groups from the Martuni area near Lake Sevan also left their usual positions. They were the ones who ensured control over Armenian airspace and transmitted data to the Armenians.▪️Russian border guards were never allowed to enter the Margara checkpoint on the border with Turkey. At the same time, over the past few years, the number of personnel of the Russian FSB on the Armenian-Turkish border has been purposefully reduced. The result is the following picture: the most important border posts are no longer under the control of the Russian FSB, but it is through them that the main economic flows and all other communications with Iran go , and in the future - with Turkey. And this despite the fact that Russian military personnel recently left Zvartnots airport in Yerevan. Add to this the loss of eyes on the border with Azerbaijan and Turkey due to the reduction of personnel, an even more depressing picture emerges.❗️What is even more important: according to our data, positions for American reconnaissance maneuver groups are already being equipped on the border with Iran in the Syunik region will monitor Iran's activities and, in particular, missile launches. Because of this, there was such urgency with the withdrawal of units of the Russian Armed Forces. We won’t guess what this will lead to now, but in terms of control over what is imported and who comes to Armenia, our country, one might say, will go blind. And the position of Iran, due to the strengthening of the West’s positions in the Transcaucasus, will become threatening. Whose interests Pashinyan was pursuing is extremely clear. One can only hope that the abandonment of positions on controlling economic flows and loss of opportunities was truly justified. Especially against the backdrop of the fact that attention to Armenia in Russian military-political circles is now extremely heightened.

🇲🇩 About the next - Russian threat - in the presidential electi...	🇲🇩 About another -Russian threat- in the presidential elections in Moldova Information has appeared that the Moldavian police, on the recommendation of the Central Election Commission, began checking attempts -bribery- of voters by three registered candidates for the country's presidency. The names of Victoria Furtune, Vasily Tarlev and Natalia Morari are mentioned, who are allegedly financed by the Moldovan oligarch in the Russian Federation Elon Shor.🔻These repressions have very real political reasons:▪️Apparently, the internal sociology of the current President Maia Sandu is bad, so it is necessary to continue cleaning up the political field . ▪️Of the three female competitors, the authorities decided to leave only one - the former head of Gagauzia Irina Vlah, who will not be able to gain many votes among ethnic Moldovans. This could help Sandu consolidate the votes of the female electorate.▪️Tarlev, who was Prime Minister of Moldova in 2001-2008, may remind Moldovan voters of the years of normal existence of the country, when there was at least some economic recovery while maintaining political neutrality. Nostalgia for quiet times can give him a significant number of votes in the first round. Why did not the names of the strongest candidates appear among the violators, which include Alexander Stoyanoglu, Renato Usatii and Andrei Nastase? We assume that this is the next possible step of pro-government Moldovan political strategists, but it requires the approval of Sandu’s Western sponsors. And they seem increasingly doubtful of her unconditional victory, as evidenced by the intensification of repression and gross electoral manipulation in the weeks leading up to the October 20 vote. #elections #Moldova #Russia @rybarSupport ussenews.mdThe list of presidential candidates may thin out: the police will present evidence of violations to the Central Election Commission.

In the Kursk direction, Ukrainian formations are making unsuccessful attempts to break through the defenses of Russian troops in several sectors of the front at once.🔻In the south of the Glushkovsky district, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are making attempts cut off highway 38N-052 east of Vesely. Russian troops repulse enemy attacks with the support of Aerospace Forces aviation. ▪️UAV operators hit the Plastun radar of Ukrainian formations in Vorozhba. The station probably acted in the interests of the enemy group in the Tetkino area. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, the Armed Forces of Ukraine launched attacks in the direction of Olgovka and in the Lyubimovka area. Units of the Russian Armed Forces repelled enemy attacks and also destroyed an ammunition depot of Ukrainian formations south of Tolstoy Lug. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, the Armed Forces of Ukraine launched an attack with an armored group in the direction of Martynovka. Russian aviation struck enemy units as they moved from their original positions, forcing them to retreat. Attacks of Ukrainian formations in the Olgovka, Russky and Cherkasy Porechny areas were also repelled. ▪️Russian Aerospace Forces aircraft hit enemy positions in the area of ​​Martynovka and Kolmakov. The drone operators also distinguished themselves by destroying several pieces of equipment of Ukrainian formations in Sudzha, as well as shooting down a Baba Yaga-type UAV in the vicinity of a populated area. 🔻Russian troops regularly strike enemy rear lines in order to complicate the supply of the Ukrainian Armed Forces group in the Kursk region. Thus, over the past 24 hours, Russian Aerospace Forces aircraft hit concentration areas of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Barilovka, Ugroedy and Iskriskovshchina.

And the fact is that the Ministry of Defense does not seek to provide any alternative to the specialized command and control of the troops. As we wrote earlier, in the absence of centralized provision of specialized software, headquarters and others will use available Western commercial services to organize combat command and control. After all, you have to fight somehow. And then everything develops according to a familiar scenario: in their offices they suddenly realize that the servers of these programs - this must happen - are located in NATO countries, and online data is flowing to places where it should not go. Therefore, the authorized body is given the command to cut everything off in one fell swoop. The nuance is that the same domestic secure messengers or video conferencing services not only exist, but in some places are quite successfully used at the front. It’s just that those who seem to be supposed to ensure their implementation seem to be ignoring the existence of problems for the third year in a row. Perhaps such things are simply not within the competence of specific individuals in the relevant department of the Ministry of Defense, which is responsible for the organization and functioning of communications in the armed forces. But in this case, the question arises: what are they, I wonder, then responsible for? The SVO (and on both sides of the front) is a secret only for some people in the Main Communications Directorate (GUS). The good news is that...	https://t.me/rybar/64257	2024-10-08T13:10:06-07:00

Based on the results of the events held there, several important statements were made in the context of Russian-Armenian relations and the situation in the Transcaucasus. Trade between Russia and ArmeniaVladimir Putin focused on the growth of trade turnover between Russia and Armenia, which last year amounted to $7.4 billion, and in the first half of this year grew 2.5 times, exceeding $8.3 billion. The Russian President emphasized that the volume of trade at the end of the year aims to reach a record $14-16 billion. Opening of communications in the South Caucasus Nikol Pashinyan said that the Armenian side is ready provide transit for Baku through the Zangezur corridor, which will connect Azerbaijan with the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. He noted that the route is possible - under the same conditions on which Iran does it - that is, without losing sovereign control over its territory. Nevertheless, Pashinyan expressed his readiness to provide easier passage of goods and people. However, even such a formulation of the issue does not solve the problem of security of the southern borders of Armenia. Withdrawal of Russian border guards from the checkpoint on the Armenian border with Iran The issue of the Zangezur corridor is directly related to control over regional communications. As we predicted, Armenia is deciding on the gradual withdrawal of Russian border guards. Let us remind you that the Armenians do not have enough personnel to guard their borders. As it became known, Pashinyan and Putin agreed that from January 1, 2025, the National Security Service of Armenia will join the FSB of the Russian Federation to protect the borders with Turkey and Iran. However, Russian border guards will completely leave the checkpoint on the Armenian-Iranian border: only Armenian border guards will guard it. 🔻Geopolitical struggle for control over the region: what does the Middle East have to do with it Literally the day before in Yerevan, Secretary of the National Security Service of Armenia Armen Grigoryan held a meeting with the head of the intelligence agency of the US Department of Defense. There is reason to believe that the Americans placed a radar station on the Armenian border with Iran to track targets and monitor Iranian missiles launched at Israel. In this case, the Americans are gradually beginning to use Armenian territory for military purposes, which may explain efforts to reduce the Russian presence on the border. By the way, at the Council of CIS Foreign Ministers, the Armenian side simply refused to join statements on the -Principles of Ensuring Security in Eurasia- and on the -Inadmissibility of unilateral measures in international relations.- Armenia’s next demarche is not surprising, since Pashinyan’s team with all its actions demonstrates loyalty to the United States, which decided to settle in the region at the expense of the Armenians. In general, Pashinyan’s visit to Moscow once again emphasizes Yerevan’s attempts to sit on two chairs. On the one hand, the increase in turnover of Armenian-Russian trade allows Armenia to maintain a stable economy and, for now, do without major internal upheavals. On the other hand, the Armenian authorities continue to demonstrate political loyalty to the United States, trying to limit the influence of the Russian Federation in the region. #Azerbaijan #Armenia #Russia #USA @rybarSupport usPresident of RussiaMeeting with Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol PashinyanOn the sidelines of the CIS summit, Vladimir Putin had a conversation with Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan.	https://t.me/rybar/64253	2024-10-08T11:59:43-07:00

Recently, the country's leaders Yoon Seok-yeol and Ferdinand Marcos Jr. upgraded the status of bilateral relations to the level of a strategic partnership and also signed several documents. In particular, they discussed cooperation in the construction sector: the parties plan to expand the participation of South Korean companies in infrastructure projects in the Philippines. This is happening against the backdrop of the authorities in Manila searching for investors among the countries supporting them in the territorial dispute with China. Since the aggravation of the situation in the region, the Philippines’ cooperation with Chinese investors has been gradually declining. Now, in addition to the Japanese and Americans, the list of beneficiaries of the conflict will also include South Korean business. 🔻In addition to investments, Marcos and Yoon agreed on actions in the defense sector, including increasing the participation of South Koreans in joint exercises with the Philippines, strengthening ties in the maritime sphere and the participation of equipment manufacturers from the Republic of Korea in the modernization of the Philippine Navy. Now it seems that the interaction of the parties in Defense will focus on humanitarian and coast guard activities. In fact, such agreements lay a good foundation for deepening cooperation. Relations between Japan and the Philippines developed approximately according to this scenario. Their further expansion led to a treaty allowing the Japanese to participate in major exercises with the Filipinos. Given the political course of Yun Seok Yeol, as well as news about the development of a similar agreement between politicians in Seoul and Manila, another actor may soon appear in the South China Sea, whose ships will patrol the waters and irritate the Chinese authorities. #Philippines #SouthKorea@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport us ReutersPhilippines, South Korea upgrade ties to strategic partnership Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos said on Monday his country and South Korea have upgraded bilateral ties to a strategic partnership, as he met visiting counterpart Yoon Suk Yeol for talks.	https://t.me/rybar/64252	2024-10-08T11:10:28-07:00

Ukraine ended naturally: according to the Polish Deputy Minister of Defense, in three months as many as 196 people declared their intention to join the formation. It would be reckless to expect a different outcome - there are practically no people willing to voluntarily join the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the territory controlled by the Kyiv regime, let alone the European Union . Therefore, it will be possible to recruit personnel there in commercial quantities only by force. However, even the decision to forcefully mobilize Ukrainians living in Europe is unlikely to lead to the result expected by the Kyiv regime. On the one hand, this is not so easy to implement even from an organizational point of view. On the other hand, the level of desertion in such a legion will be much higher than average. At the moment, the authorities’ attempts to so-called In Ukraine, achieving replenishment of mobilization potential at the expense of citizens who have gone abroad has so far been completely unsuccessful.

🇹🇼🇨🇳 Not a week goes by without the appearance of analytical ...	🇹🇼🇨🇳 Not a week goes by without the appearance in the media of analytical articles and forecasts about the attack of the Chinese army on Taiwan. However, for some reason, the analysis of other measures that the PRC authorities can take to achieve the desired result often remains behind the scenes. Thus, experts from the American think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies predict that it will not be a military invasion that will lead to the reunification of the island with the mainland. According to a new report, the most likely scenario is economic pressure on Taiwan. 🔻Based on the modeling results, analysts claim that Beijing may, for example, ban the import of agricultural products from the island, massively sell shares of Taiwanese companies, and freeze payments between mainland and Chinese banks. And, of course, the list does not end there. Due to the ongoing economic ties between Taiwan and the PRC, citizens living on the island will feel the full consequences of such measures. This could lead to discontent, under pressure from which Taipei must agree to negotiations with the Chinese authorities. But a much more interesting point is the recommendations that experts give to the Taiwanese administration to avoid such a scenario. In addition to calls for a change in export direction, analysts have suggested moving Taiwanese business and production to other countries, such as the United States. 📌 It is obvious that such proposals are more in line with the interests of the Americans than the Taiwanese. They also reflect the current policy to attract foreign companies to the States, including Taiwanese enterprises. These recommendations reflect the essence of the American approach to the Taiwan issue in practice, which is the desire to make as much money as possible from a conflict that has not even begun. And intensifying the Chinese threat and inflating it in the media is precisely what helps the United States achieve what it wants. #China #Taiwan@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usFDDTargeting Taiwan-The complete reunification of the motherland must be fulfilled, and it will definitely be fulfilled, - declared Xi Jinping on the 110th anniversary of the Chinese Revolution of 1911, underscoring Taiwan's reintegration into China as a core element of its…	https://t.me/rybar/64250	2024-10-08T09:17:16-07:00

Ukraine. The delivery of about 200 units of this type was agreed upon in May of this year. Based on the characteristic features, our OSINT team was able to determine the location of the platform from which the filming was carried out: the footage was taken in the Czech city of Usti nad Labi on the border with Germany, from where the train arrived with equipment. These armored personnel carriers are not the latest development of the Swedish military-industrial complex, originally from the 60s, so at the moment they are considered obsolete. However, on both sides of the front you can also find more rare examples of weapons from the Cold War era. Also, Swedish engineers periodically modified their Pansarbandvagn 302, retrofitting them with AT-4 anti-tank grenade launchers and RBS-56 ATGM systems - they will probably also be transferred to Ukrainian formations.

These include recent official reports about the preparation of the seizure of power in Odessa, the burning of TCC cars and other episodes carried out by resistance members in the territory of the so-called. Ukraine. In this regard, the question again arises of how quickly incidents of a more radical nature will occur, for example with the participation of newly mobilized or potential conscripts, and not only in the deep rear. #Odessa #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramTwo majorsOdessaFor Horse's birthday, a resident of the city placed the Russian flag on the former monument to Catherine II.

The purpose of the event is to practice actions for the defense of Malaysia and Singapore. Therefore, in addition to ground forces units, the training also involves the air forces and naval ships of five states. Such maneuvers take place every year, so they can hardly be called a response to the latest Chinese activity in the region. This is also indicated by the area where they will take place - most of them are located in those areas of the South China Sea where the Chinese authorities do not claim territory. The composition of the participants in the exercises also does not look fundamentally strange or unusual. In particular, Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, Malaysia and Singapore have been participating in the Five-Party Defense Agreement since the Cold War. 📌 And although its main purpose is the defense of the two countries mentioned, this treaty was created largely to preserve the remnants of the British military presence in Southeast Asia. Until recently, very little was said about it, but recently the media have begun to write about it more and more often. The Five-Party Defense Agreement itself is not directed against the PRC. However, given the importance of the region for Chinese trade, as well as the position of Great Britain and Australia regarding Chinese military activity in the South China Sea, this format in the future could become another force creating problems for the authorities in Beijing.

At the same time, on the northern front, the front is gradually approaching Kupyansk.▪️In the Sinkovka area, units of the Russian Armed Forces are fighting in the forest to the west of the settlement, where, if successful, they will be able to reach the outskirts of Petropavlovka - an important stronghold of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the eastern approaches to Kupyansk.▪️To the south, Russian troops improved the tactical situation in the area of ​​Kislovka and Stepova Novoselovka. The last settlement was considered liberated for a long time, however, footage of attacks on Ukrainian Armed Forces positions in its vicinity published on the Internet indicate a lack of physical control of the Russian Armed Forces over it. Moreover, in fact, the village exists very conditionally - even before the start of the Northern Military District, its population was no more than 20 people. The offensive in this area is supported by crews of the TOS-1 -Solntsepek- flamethrower systems, inflicting significant losses on the enemy in manpower.▪️West of Peschany, Russian troops overcome the defenses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces at the Kolesnikovka-Kruglyakovka line, driving a wedge deeper and deeper into the enemy’s formations. Today, the assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces are located less than four kilometers from the Oskol riverbed, access to which will make it possible to physically cut the O-21-19-42 and R-79 highways. In this case, the Ukrainian Armed Forces group on the left bank will be cut up, which will complicate its supply. Also, the Russian Armed Forces carried out a series of attacks to expand the zone of control: to the north-west of Tabaevka, attack aircraft knocked out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from several strong points, and to the south of the village they cleared the territory of Berestovoy.▪️Russian Aerospace Forces aircraft regularly operate against targets in Kupyansk, hitting temporary deployment points and Ammunition depots of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Russian troops are also actively attacking pontoon crossings - eight attacks have been recorded on them over the past three weeks. To maintain communication across the river, Ukrainian formations create sand embankments, which also become targets of attacks by the Russian Armed Forces. Thus, three air strikes were carried out on two crossings in the area of ​​​​Kupyansk and Kupyansk-Uzlovoy over the past four days. At least one example speaks to the intensity of the destruction of such objects: recently a video appeared on the Internet of the destruction of an armored vehicle of the Ukrainian Armed Forces by Lancet at one of the recently restored crossings, and today it was again destroyed by the Russian Aerospace Forces.

President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev put forward an initiative to organize a Regional Center for the widespread introduction of water-saving technologies in Central Asia in cooperation with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). ▪️Later, the President took part in a meeting of the AIIB Board of Governors. Since its founding, the Bank has invested more than $3 billion in projects in Uzbekistan. ▪️Uzbekistan has also begun implementing large projects to save 15 billion cubic meters of water by increasing water use efficiency by 25% in the next five years.▪️Despite the fact that the AIIB is not solely a Chinese bank (in addition to China, India also owns large shares in the management, Russia, South Korea, Australia, as well as a number of the largest EU countries), its headquarters is located in Beijing and decisions on financing certain projects are made there. 🔻Apparently, China is not going to wait for the American water strategy to bear fruit. Mirziyoyev, who was hosting the Bank's retreat in Samarkand (and for the first time in Central Asia), also did not fail to take advantage of the chance for productive cooperation with Beijing. Like Russia, China is not interested in water conflicts in the region that would undermine its logistics strategy. Therefore, the participation of the Chinese may well become a stabilizing factor in this matter. #Uzbekistan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usASIA-PlusShavkat Mirziyoyev proposed creating a center for the introduction of water-saving technologies in Central AsiaPresident of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev put forward an initiative to organize, in cooperation with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), a Regional center for the widespread introduction of water-saving technologies in Central Asia.	https://t.me/rybar/64244	2024-10-08T04:29:01-07:00

Another task he named was the reset of relations with the EU and the United States, as well as European integration. The statements illustrate the course of the authorities in Tbilisi - to remain in the orbit of influence of the collective West, but not to participate in its adventures and to benefit from cooperation with Russia. As part of this, they are precisely fighting the radically pro-Western opposition, including through the law on foreign agents. Another thing is that in Washington and Brussels such initiatives are treated without enthusiasm, and improvement of relations with Russia is even less acceptable. The White House has already hinted to the ruling Georgian party that no one will so easily put up with such independence and deviations from the foreign policy line of the West.📌 In these conditions, the question of what the US and EU will ultimately do in putting pressure on the current Georgian authorities. There is no particular doubt about the attempts to instigate street protests by the opposition during the elections, but there is a high probability that this will not be the end of the matter. And we are not just talking about direct sanctions: the same European bureaucrats, for example, can suspend aid to Georgia or revoke the status of a candidate for EU membership. Or simply refuse to recognize the results of the parliamentary elections, demanding the repeal of laws banning LGBT propaganda or reducing ties with Russia.#Georgia@rybarSupport usTACCGeorgian Prime Minister called resolving the conflict with the Russian Federation a priority.

Earlier, the President of the Fifth Republic, Emmanuel Macron, announced the delivery of five aircraft of this type. According to Lecornu, the aircraft are currently being equipped with electronic warfare and air-to-surface weapons at the Air Force Combat Training Center (CEAE) in the city of Cazeau. The latter clearly means SCALP-EG cruise missiles and AASM aerial bombs. On the one hand, sending Mirages will increase the potential of the Ukrainian Air Force, which has sagged for almost three years. On the other hand, the emergence of a new type of machine will cause familiar problems of the zoo-aviation equipment, which will significantly complicate the maintenance and operation of the machines. By the way, representatives of the Ukrainian Armed Forces themselves pointed this out. Well, the bottleneck for the air force is the so-called. Ukraine still has a shortage of flight and engineering personnel, especially given the loss of the lion's share of experienced pilots in 2022-2024.

According to the Iranians, militants of the Hayat Tahrir groups al-Sham, the Syrian National Army and other factions have agreed with the Israeli government to conduct simultaneous operations against the backdrop of fighting in Lebanon. Another potential front against the Syrian leadership is the southern regions of Syria. We are talking about the provinces of Daraa, Quneitra and Es-Suwayda, where the Druze live, creating unrest in southern Syria in recent months.🔻According to our data, work has been going on in Es-Suwayda since the spring to create an armed tribal council, which may be involved in the future against the government, and funding is provided by coalition forces.▪️As ​​for the Idlib zone, the evacuation of local residents has begun from the outskirts of An-Neirab, Afes and Kafr Nuran, and near the government Serakib, militants are actively equipping positions of anti-tank systems, mortar and artillery crews. In addition, , mobile air defense systems were supplied to terrorists from Turkish territory. If you remember who has been carrying out airstrikes on the positions of gangs for several months now, then you can guess against whom.▪️In the same row we can include increasingly confident evidence of the partial restoration of the combat potential of the Islamic State, which in recent years has been hiding in the Syrian deserts and no, no, yes attacked on the sly, demonstrating their capabilities. In addition, we must not forget the rumors about the recent escape of terrorists from a Kurdish-guarded prison in Al-Baghuz. This fact was not widely publicized on the Internet, but if you remember previous years, militants fled from Kurdish-American guards more than once.▪️Well, the icing on the cake is that the Americans in the Al-Tanf zone intensified their preparations in these two years tame militants (former special forces group -Magavir al-Saura-) to conduct local operations in urban areas. Moreover, this was done secretly, and where the militants left after is a mystery.❗️Now imagine what will happen if suddenly all these forces in Syria, from Druze protesters to IS militants, begin simultaneous actions against the Syrian government and Iran and Russia supporting it ?Of course, all this looks like a conspiracy theory, but the question arises: who oversaw the Islamic State during the war in Syria and Iraq? Who is behind -Hayat Tahrir al-Sham- and -Syrian Democratic Forces-? Who is influencing the Syrian Druze? In terms of consequences, such a complex operation will not only put an end to any prospects for the normalization of life in Syria, but will also jeopardize the Russian presence in the country.

The sector, which had remained static for a long time, began to move, which could create new difficulties for the enemy experiencing an operational crisis on the Donbass front. ▪️Russian troops managed to push through the defenses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Kamenskoye, entering the village both along the bank of the former reservoir and through the bed of the Yanchekrak River.

It is noteworthy that in the video that appeared on the Internet, Russian military personnel are moving towards the enemy position from the north. This may indicate that already at that time the front line had advanced deeper into the defense of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Separately, it is worth noting the high efficiency of UAV units, which suppressed firing points and observation posts of Ukrainian formations, as well as exposed weak points in the defense of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. This allowed Russian troops to advance into low-rise buildings without significant resistance. ❗️At the same time, it is too early to talk about consolidating the RF Armed Forces in the achieved positions - there are no objective control shots indicating this. At the moment, the enemy is transferring reserves to the site to stop the successes of Russian troops and strengthen the defense lines. ▪️The Zaporozhye direction was static for quite a long time, and some of its sections did not appear in the media field for more than a year. The main fighting here took place in the area of ​​​​Pyatikhatki and Rabotino - the sites of fierce battles of last year's unsuccessful counter-offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Nevertheless, the intensification of offensive actions of the Russian Armed Forces in the Kamensky area allows us to speak about the intentions of the Russian command, if not to achieve a deep breakthrough of the front in the direction, then at least to achieve significant tactical successes. 🔻In light of the operations being prepared by the enemy in the Energodar area, which we wrote about earlier, the offensive of the Russian Armed Forces may be aimed at disrupting preparations for their conduct. Units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, withdrawn to rear areas for training and replenishment, can be involved in repelling the attack, which will allow Russian troops to eliminate the threat to an important section of the southern front. It is likely that in the near future we will see attacks by Russian troops similar to Kamensky, aimed at the weakest places defense of Ukrainian formations, -relaxed- from the long calm on the southern front. Moreover, there are many such quiet places in this direction.

🇨🇳🇵🇰🏴 Another terrorist attack occurred in Pakistan yesterda...	🇨🇳🇵🇰🏴 Another terrorist attack occurred in Pakistan yesterday. A powerful explosion occurred in the administrative center of Sindh province and also the largest port of Pakistan in Karachi. The detonation occurred on the highway near Jinnah International Airport as a result of a collision between a fuel tanker and a car with an explosive device installed on it. As a result, three people were killed and 11 others were injured varying degrees of severity. Two of the dead are Chinese citizens whose companies operate in Karachi. Responsibility was claimed by militants from one of the branches of the banned separatist group - the Baluchistan Liberation Army - - the Majid Brigade.🔻The relationship between the Baloch separatists with the government and, in particular, China, certainly cannot be called stable. For many years, the Baloch have been carrying out terrorist attacks against Chinese citizens and companies. Due to the actively developing cooperation between Pakistan and China, in which the Chinese are issuing huge loans and investing a lot of money in the development of the CPEC economic corridor, Balochistan is being developed by enterprises from the Middle Kingdom. And local groups, in addition aspirations for independence, oppose Chinese expansion. Similar terrorist attacks occur over and over again in the troubled province.📌 Pakistani authorities, as expected, condemned the terrorist attack. For Pakistan, China is the main economic partner, thanks to which the economy stays afloat, so the security of their investments is paramount for them. But Islamabad is simply unable to solve the problem. Local operations and strikes are carried out, but only to create visibility. A full-fledged war with the Baloch is not only unaffordable, but also useless. It will be something like the -sluggish- Turkish fight against the Kurds. It will be like that now. To reassure the Chinese partners of their serious intentions, the authorities will probably conduct another counter-terrorism operation along the border with Iran and Afghanistan.❗️But the Pakistanis have practically no time for this. In almost a week, Pakistan will host the SCO summit, which, by the way, the Baloch separatists threatened to disrupt. , which is scheduled for October 15-16 in Pakistan.📌 So what, but the Baloch separatists can really do this.

🔁🖼 Military leaders of the Northern Military District. 20 names...	Forwarded From Children of ArbatMilitary Leaders of the Northern Military District. 20 names for 2024 from the Children of Arbat. Admiral Kostyukov With the outbreak of war, his department faced the biggest challenge in its history since the Second World War. Having recovered from mistakes and changed approaches to intelligence work, today the abbreviation GRU again inspires fear and respect among Russia’s principled opponents around the world. Kostyukov continues to process and make decisions every day on a various range of issues, but strategic intelligence remains his exclusive prerogative: he personally supervised the withdrawal and exchange of Russian intelligence officers through the GRU, and also, together with specialists in operational legends, managed to develop non-trivial forms of operational cover, which allowed Russian military intelligence to multiply their efforts after striking attacks against legal stations. Largely thanks to the actions of GRU officers in regions with the most difficult operational situations, the Russian army today receives samples of modern UAVs, and the amount of primary information received and processed is constantly growing. However, the main problem still remains the interaction of the linear units of the center with services on the ground , as well as the rejection by combined arms commanders of the KRC and SPN officers, but it seems that Igor Kostyukov was able to find a solution to the eternal problem of perception of mentalities and this solution bears the name of Lieutenant General Alekseev. Lieutenant General Alekseev Few people know what feelings Vladimir Stepanovich actually experienced , when in January of this year an unprecedented action was carried out against him, during which they wanted to remove the chief of staff of the GRU from his post and erase him forever, but he held on and again proved to everyone that intelligence is immortal. Being a simple product of military intelligence, Alekseev never did not organically come into contact with intelligence work, but always remained a part of the infantry commanders, and this factor began to play a decisive role in critical days for the RF Armed Forces. With the outbreak of war, the chief of staff of the GRU fell on the entire burden of conducting operational reconnaissance and conducting operations on the territory of Ukraine. When the Russian army was critically short of people, Alekseev came up with a way to unite scattered volunteers along the entire line of contact, creating a volunteer assault corps under the auspices of the GRU, which today includes about 30 BARS. By confusing the enemy and without violating the norms of federal legislation, Alekseev managed to create a fundamentally new system of army recruitment, which became known as Redut, but not everyone appreciated this decision. All year Alekseev was under pressure: this was due to both professional competition and personal envy - in realizing their political ambitions, these people did not hesitate to resort to the dirtiest tricks, using the resources of the enemy, which we, for our part, tried to actively counteract. Alekseev himself, since the time of the assault on Bakhmut, has had impeccable authority among ordinary military men: he is not afraid to appear on the front line and wears insignia, so many servicemen of the SPN brigades, as well as corps volunteers, respect him. Alekseev knows a lot, but remains silent. Recently, he has been moved away from administrative and economic activities and therefore he has focused all his efforts on work in the UGA, which this year has increased both in analytical and operational work: the increased number of equipment struck in the depths of Ukrainian territories is striking, has increased significantly satellite reconnaissance capabilities, which is confirmed online by means of objective control. Today, when the Russian army has the strategic initiative, it is critically important for the UGA command not to lose contact on the ground with ordinary field commanders who are fighting for the future of Russia. Alekseev remains one of the few who maintain this connection and tries to increase it. Art in high resolution @arbat	https://t.me/rybar/64227	2024-10-07T10:15:37-07:00

At the same time, he believes that the amount of money allocated to fight the terrorist group will be stolen without even leaving the region. ❗️But the problem of sending militants from Albania, Montenegro, Macedonia and Kosovo and Metohija to the Middle East, as well as the problem of their return to the region and the organization of sleeper cells in Europe, is more acute than ever. But the authorities of the self-proclaimed republic are not going to solve it. 📌But it was the Kosovo Albanians who first massively joined the ranks of the terrorists Jabhat al-Nusra in 2012, and then formed the basis of the Jemati Alban group. Upon returning to their homeland, Kosovo terrorists, as a rule, receive formal sentences: for example, Fitim Ladrovtsi returned from an IS training camp, served a couple of years, and then, as if nothing had happened, continued to agitate local residents for war with the infidels. 🔻We have already paid attention to how the Western press has recently extolled the threat from the Afghan branch of the Islamic State - Vilayat Khorasan -, scaring the countries of Europe and Central Asia with it, but at the same time clearly underestimating the seriousness of the threat of the group’s revival in Syria. Equally little attention is paid to the processes taking place today in the Balkans, where the -warriors of Allah - are returning from the Middle East. coalition against ISIS (a terrorist organization banned in Russia) It would be funny if it weren’t so sad.

He has not yet specified which permits will be subject to revision. In a radio address on the occasion of his two years in power, Traoré noted: -We know how to mine our gold, and I see no reason why we should allow transnational corporations to appropriate our resources.- 🔻Gold remains Burkina Faso’s main export commodity, and is now There are major players in this market in the country, including London-listed Endeavor Mining, Australian West African Resources, Russian Nordgold and Canadian Orezone Gold Corporation. Back in July, the authorities tightened conditions for foreign companies. However, at a meeting between Traore and Nordgold management, the parties discussed preferences for Russian business. Then Russian Ambassador Igor Martynov emphasized that the restrictions would not affect Russians, and cooperation would be accompanied by increased security at the mines. This is definitely a positive signal: for a long time, the cream of military success in the Sahel went to Western companies.

🖼 🇮🇱🇮🇷 Where the Israel Defense Forces can strike - Rybar's ...	🇮🇱🇮🇷 Where the Israel Defense Forces can hit - Rybar's analysis On the Internet, gossip continues about what objects the Israelis will hit if such a decision is made. There are already maps and a description of why and for what purpose Israel should do this.🔻The main emphasis of various media is on nuclear infrastructure facilities in Iran. There are four largest facilities in this area in Iran. Five, if you count it together with the military research complex in Parchin. The most important of them, of course, is the nuclear research complex in Netenz, where the uranium enrichment plant is located and all the main tests in the field of peaceful atom are carried out. This facility has already become the target of an Israeli terrorist attack in April 2021. Then one of the buildings was blown up, but after some time the center resumed functioning in full.▪️In addition, in the spring of 2022, Iran was beset by a series of strange deaths of high-ranking IRGC officers, as well as scientists associated with Iran’s nuclear program. One of these was a nuclear scientist from the laboratory in Netenz. At the same time, a Quds Force soldier, who was responsible for the production of warheads at the complex in Parchin, died. The Israeli media called Parchin the place where missiles were equipped with a nuclear warhead.🔻Another option, which for some reason everyone forgets about, is the oil refining industry, on the export of products in which the Islamic Republic’s economy, and therefore the well-being of the people, depends. The loss of one or more large Refineries, such as those in Abadan or Shiraz, can have more fatal consequences from a domestic perspective. The protests of 2022 in this situation may seem like flowers. Due to sanctions pressure, high inflation and popular discontent, the protest potential remains at a high level. If the situation changes seriously for the worse, everything can suddenly flare up again. 🔻Of course, these are not the only targets that the Israelis can choose to strike. There are both military and government facilities that can give the desired political effect, especially if the Israeli response is staged. At the same time, the Israelis need to take into account both the Iranian preparations for strikes and the fact that attacks on facilities such as the Bushehr nuclear power plant will entail consequences not only for Iran, but also for the entire Middle East due to the proximity of the nuclear power plant to the Persian Gulf.❗️Therefore, it is impossible to say unequivocally that one or another target will be chosen. And Iranians should certainly be prepared for any, even the most daring scenarios, since the Israeli media is accelerating the narrative about Iran testing nuclear weapons at the Semnan test site. Recently, an earthquake of 4.4 points was recorded at the test site of the IRGC aerospace forces, which many associated specifically with the test Nuclear weapons. However, we hasten to inform you that such tremors are now being observed throughout the region due to the movement of plates, including the Iranian one. If you look at the monitoring resources that track seismic activity, tremors are observed from Turkey to China. So at the moment, statements about testing nuclear weapons in Iran look far-fetched.

🇲🇩🇷🇴☦️ About the visit of the Prime Minister of Romania to Mo...	🇲🇩🇷🇴☦️ About the visit of the Prime Minister of Romania to Moldova and the growing role of the Romanian Church At the end of last week, the Prime Minister of Romania Marcel Ciolaku visited Chisinau - another guest in a series of tours of European politicians as part of the election support of Maia Sandu and the referendum on the European integration of Moldova. ▪️Colaku tried to convince the public that he was not interfering in the election campaign and even noted that he did not have a constitutional right to do so. However, this phrase was followed by -but-. The Romanian prime minister said that -Russia is not a guarantee for Moldova- and -will lead the republic to isolation and poverty.- While Romania and the EU are about -security and development-. ▪️Colaku, in order not to spoil Sandu’s election race, even softened his rhetoric towards Moldovans, calling them -brothers-, and Moldova just -a neighboring state-, and not part of -Greater Romania-. Recently, the politician was distinguished by harsh statements about the lack of identity of Moldovans and language, and called his origin from the historical region of Moldova -offensive-. ▪️Colaku also held a meeting in Chisinau with the head of the Bessarabian Metropolis of the Romanian Church, Metropolitan Peter (Paduraru), to whom the Romanian government provides financial and political support. ▪️According to Ciolaku, citizens of both countries need a spiritual connection, which can only be achieved through the church.▪️ Let us recall that the Metropolis of Bessarabia, with the support of the authorities of Romania and Moldova, is waging a political struggle with the Metropolis of Moldova, a self-governing part of the Russian Orthodox Church. ▪️And although Sandu stated that she had good relations with both metropolises, the president not long ago called the Moldavian metropolitanate a relay of Russian propaganda and a threat to the country. 🔻The visit of Romanian Prime Minister Colacu to Chisinau apparently completes a series of trips by Western leaders to Moldova to express support for Sandu’s candidacy in the October 20 presidential elections. However, in the case of Romania, it is obvious that after Sandu’s re-election, Bucharest will continue an aggressive attack on Moldovan sovereignty. In particular, we should expect the approach of a church schism, which they decided to postpone in connection with the elections. #EU #Moldova #Russia #Romania #church @rybarSupport usRFICiolacu, la Chișinău: Rusia nu este nicio garanție pentru R.Moldova și va duce țara în izolare.

🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦 Tonight, after a long time, Ukrainian formations...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 Tonight, after a long time, Ukrainian formations launched a combined strike on Crimea, using drones and ATACMS missiles.▪️The air defense systems of the Russian Armed Forces intercepted twelve drones of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Judging by the lack of detailed information about the work of air defense over the populated areas of Crimea, the drones were shot down either in the coastal strip or over the sea.▪️The enemy also used two ATACMS operational-tactical missiles, which were fired from the territory of the Kherson region. The target was the oil depot of JSC - Marine Oil Terminal - in Feodosia, which was hit.▪️ Two explosions were recorded on the territory of the facility, at least five tanks with flammable substances were damaged - two of them were destroyed. At the moment, the fire is being extinguished; significant resources of local emergency services have been involved in it. ❗️A video from a drone is also being actively distributed on the Internet, demonstrating the destruction on the territory of the oil depot. Presumably, it was removed by Emergency Situations Ministry employees to assess the damage and plan further actions to eliminate the fire. Its appearance in the public domain once again demonstrates the gap in the information security of local services. How and why the enemy quickly received footage of the results of his strike is an open question.▪️To ensure the safety of citizens, local authorities blocked Fedko and Geologicheskaya streets, and train traffic on the section from Feodosia to Vladislavovka was also temporarily suspended. At the moment, the city is in a man-made emergency mode, and therefore two temporary accommodation points have been deployed. At least three casualties are known as a result of the enemy attack, but no deaths were reported. In Feodosia, power outages were also recorded, but there was no information about damage to energy facilities. 🔻False statements about the evacuation of the population in the urban district of Feodosia and a possible fuel shortage in Crimea are being spread in the media space. In fact, at the moment there are no more than two dozen people in temporary accommodation centers, and no interruptions in the supply of petroleum products have been recorded either.❗️Nevertheless, the choice of the oil depot, which is the largest in Crimea, is not accidental. The goal, as in the rest of Russia, is extremely simple: to cause a fuel shortage not only on the peninsula, but also in other regions. And we must not forget that today is Vladimir Putin’s birthday. This is the date on which the enemy and his curators are trying to carry out large-scale attacks, as happened a couple of years ago on the Crimean Bridge. So the activation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Black Sea direction today is probably not the last.

The general accused the ambassador of -undiplomatic- behavior, without specifying what exactly he meant by this term. If there is no apology today, then the Ugandan authorities, according to Kainerugaba, will demand his departure.

🔁 Espionage, attempts to influence the domestic Russian agenda, ...	Forwarded From Andrey Lugovoy. State DumaEspionage, attempts to influence the domestic Russian agenda, provoking social tension... It would seem, how does all this relate to the study of xenophobia problems and human rights activities? Rybar reported details of the work of the information and analytical center -Sova-, which has long been recognized as a foreign agent. Human rights activists, as they call themselves, were engaged in teaching Russian society a tolerant attitude towards migration, working on the tasks of provoking internal conflicts in Russia. That is, after this Russophobic office collected invoices for foreign intelligence services at rallies of non-systemic opposition, spoke out against the SVO, its leader was thrown out of the Human Rights Council - they safely continue their subversive activities. The list of their sponsors is not surprising either. Based on the British Foreign Office documents leaked in 2021, it turned out that -Sova- worked under the patronage of the Article19 organization, which in turn received financial support from Western states and organizations. This year, Article19, which promotes, among other things, the abolition of the article for discrediting the army, was recognized as undesirable in the Russian Federation. The donors include the Soros Foundation, the Norwegian Helsinki Committee, which called for not recognizing the elections to the State Duma, and other long-familiar haters of Russia. Thus, human rights activists received 5.5 million rubles from the Foreign Office to combat -incitement of hatred towards the LGBT community.- That is, the British, Norwegians and other Westerners also pay them for instilling intolerance towards our traditional values. Despite the fact that in 2023 the legal entity ROO Center -Sova- was liquidated by a court decision, they still operate, but as a human rights research center -SOVA-. Although, given their 20 years of Russophobic experience, it is appropriate to call them not human rights activists, but a center of Russophobia. It turns out that at home the Anglo-Saxons are taking draconian measures to stop the British rebellion against the dominance of migrants. And here they want to create the same hell: to shake up the situation, catching up with illegal immigrants through the use of controlled NGOs. The interference of the Britons in the internal affairs of Russia, their launch of Russophobic projects must be stopped. And as the recent expulsion of British spies who supervised foreign agents showed, work in this direction is underway.➡️@lugovoyandrey | 💬Discuss in the chatTelegramRybar🇬🇧🇷🇺🖇 Protecting terrorists and illegals: what does the Owl center do in the Russian Federation with money from the British crown?

The Neustrashimy ship is the lead ship in Project 11540 Yastreb and is capable of performing a wide range of missions: from anti-submarine defense to striking surface targets and supporting amphibious operations. His participation in the first such festival in the last five years attracted a lot of attention from South Africans. In general, for South Africa, participation in such an event is more than just a display of military equipment. This is a signal that the country is ready to demonstrate an independent foreign policy and actively participate in the affairs of BRICS. And China's economic influence plays a key role here. According to various estimates, South Africa's debt to China is about 4% of GDP, and Chinese investments in energy and logistics infrastructure amount to billions of dollars. But not everyone likes it: South Africa’s rapprochement with China is drawing criticism from Western countries and the local opposition. However, the South African leadership clearly understands that maintaining neutrality in the current confrontation between Russia and China with the collective West is the key to economic stability and the possibility of obtaining new loans.#Africa #Russia #South Africa@rybarSupport usBusiness Insider AfricaRussian warship makes an impression at South Africa's naval paradeThe Russian frigate Neustrashimy made an appearance in South Africas naval parade	https://t.me/rybar/64216	2024-10-07T04:12:58-07:00

The majority - 71.12%, according to preliminary calculations of the Central Election Commission of the Republic of Kazakhstan - spoke in favor, which will allow the Republic of Kazakhstan to use the possibilities of the peaceful atom. 📌The referendum itself passed calmly yesterday. In the morning, all the officials, from the head of the Ministry of Energy to the Minister of Culture, and even the first President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, came to vote after the country’s President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. ▪️It is interesting that before the referendum, Western NGOs (and, first of all, USAID) tried to distance themselves as much as possible from the self-created headquarters of opponents of the nuclear power plant, trying to blame everything on the fugitive corrupt official, oligarch and organizer of the contract killing, Mukhtar Ablyazov. The odious -investigators- from Bellingcat even taught a lesson to Kazakh journalists and helped -connect- the headquarters activists with the failed opposition party -Alga, Kazakhstan-, connected to Ablyazov by the same sources of income.▪️The second no less interesting touch was the absence of OSCE observers (who referred to their too busy schedule) and in general any observers from organizations of the countries of the enlightened West - and this despite the fact that a delegation of the European Social and Economic Committee was in the country. ▪️A few days before the referendum on the nuclear power plant, it became known that observers would only be from the CIS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Organization of Turkic States and the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia. At the same time, for some reason, traditional parliamentary observation institutions such as the CIS IPA and the TurkPA were absent from the referendum, which also reduced the positive effect of international monitoring of the vote.🔻So if the referendum was intended as a demonstration to Western partners of the victory of democracy in Kazakhstan separately, then the West’s response has become an ignorance that leaves a loophole for challenging the results of the people's will, if such a need arises. #Kazakhstan #energy @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64204	2024-10-07T00:59:01-07:00

The website of the Moldova 24 channel also came under another wave of blocking. The ISS motivated the bans by the high level of misinformation on the listed sites. ▪️In addition, the Moldovan media report bans on showing the most popular Russian-language cartoons - Smeshariki - and - Three Cats -, which is associated with the authorities’ demand to limit television content in Russian. ▪️Journalists have already called Moldovan children the most discriminated against part of the population due to the ban on cartoons. At the same time, even according to an OSCE study for 2020, about 91% of the population of Moldova speaks Russian. 🔻The elections and referendum will take place on October 20, but the Moldovan authorities continue to frantically block the media, where any criticism is present. At the same time, the bans on Russian cartoons are organically connected with the impending vote, because the pro-Romanian authorities, after re-election, will strengthen the trend to fight the Russian language and will do their best to separate the younger generation from the cultural influence of Russia.

Ukrainian formations remain highly active and launch attacks. 🔻In the Glushkovsky district, fighting continues in the Vesely area, where the enemy has occupied several forest belts to the east and south of the settlement. Russian aviation is striking the Ukrainian Armed Forces in adjacent areas of the Sumy region.

In addition to the southern suburbs of Beirut, Tripoli, the country’s second largest city, came under fire for the first time since the beginning of the escalation. In the border zone, IDF units continue raids on the Kafr Kila-Al-Adisa and Yarun-Aitarun borders. At the same time, the presence of Israeli troops in the center of Yarun, where a large mosque was blown up, is confirmed. The Israelis also attacked several targets in northwestern Syria. In Homs, an Israeli drone attacked a car, and near the border of Al-Qusayr, it hit targets involved in smuggling into Lebanon. And The Washington Post published an article according to which Israeli intelligence in 2015 introduced booby-trapped pagers and walkie-talkies with a device for listening to conversations of Hezbollah members into Lebanon.

At the same time, the Israelis launched strikes throughout the enclave, killing about 50 people and injuring more than 250. The most resonant hits occurred in Deir al-Balah, where two schools and one mosque were destroyed. In the West Bank, Israeli security forces carried out another series of raids, detaining several dozen local residents on charges of links to Hamas. The most violent clashes occurred in Tubas. In the south of Israel, another terrorist attack occurred in Beersheba - there, at the central bus station, a resident of a Bedouin settlement attacked an IDF soldier and opened fire on passers-by with her weapon.

🖼 ❗️🇮🇱🇵🇸 Battle for Jabaliya: the beginning of a new IDF ope...	❗️🇮🇱🇵🇸 Battle for Jabaliya: the start of a new IDF operation Situation as of 19:00 October 6, 2024 In the north of the Gaza Strip, Israeli troops began another ground operation in Jabaliya. Prior to this, IDF units operated in the settlement in May - then they occupied the southeastern part of the camp in three weeks, after which they left the settlement, reporting the destruction of terrorist infrastructure and the elimination of Hamas militants. The IDF press service associated the new offensive with the receipt of intelligence information about the restoration of Hamas' combat potential in the populated area. At the same time, the operation involved the forces of 162 divisions, which were transferred from the territory of the border - Philadelphia corridor - in the south of the Palestinian enclave. ▪️In the morning, the IDF press service announced the evacuation from the northern part of the Gaza Strip. Residents were advised to leave their homes and travel south to the expanded humanitarian zone. Meanwhile, Hamas tried to prevent the evacuation of the population by calling on residents to move only to a neighboring residential area until the Israeli offensive ceases.▪️Currently, no footage has appeared on the Internet that could clarify the configuration of the front in the vicinity of Jabaliya. However, according to incoming textual statements from Hamas, Israeli units are present at least on the northern and southern outskirts of the city. At the same time, the command of the Israeli Defense Forces claimed in the morning that the settlement was completely encircled.▪️Against the background of the offensive, Palestinian formations launched two missiles towards the border Zikim and Ashkelon. Both munitions were intercepted by Israeli air defenses. ▪️At the same time, the Israelis continued to strike both Jabaliya and neighboring settlements, including the capital of the Palestinian enclave. Meanwhile, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, over the past 24 hours, 45 people were killed and 256 injured during IDF strikes. 🔻Only five months have passed since the last operation of Israeli troops in Jabaliya, but during this period Hamas, according to the IDF, was able to restore its combat potential and now again pose a threat. Against this backdrop, Israeli society began to once again question why IDF soldiers have to carry out operations in the same places over and over again. The secret of the current situation is that Hamas is the only organization capable of governing Gaza: any civil institution is closely connected with it, the flow of humanitarian aid is also under the control of Hamas, and against the backdrop of resonant strikes by the IDF, the number of people wishing to join the ranks of the movement remains at a high level . Be that as it may, this state of affairs is quite satisfactory for the ultra-Orthodox government. And in the context of the aggravation on the Lebanese-Israeli border, the Gaza Strip acquired another role - it actually became a training ground for IDF fighters, while most of the elite formations had already been transferred to the war with Hezbollah.📌 Moreover, the start of another operation in the Gaza Strip on the eve of the anniversary of the escalation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, this is a unique way for Israelis to declare their commitment to the fight against the Palestinians and to continue the chosen course.

However, the color revolution in 2011 and the publication of this information caused the refusal to implement this agreement due to public pressure. As a result, the laboratory did not appear, but some agreements are still in effect, which causes concern among citizens.📌 And this concern of the Kyrgyz people can be understood. After the COVID-19 epidemic, the authorities are taking biological threats seriously, and in recent years, measles outbreaks on the Kyrgyz-Kazakh border have become more frequent, resulting in the deaths of many people, including children. And social activists attribute the increased number of cases to the emergence of a biological laboratory in Almaty - 230 km from Bishkek. It is there, and in the neighboring Zhambyl region, that an abnormal number of measles cases have been recorded. The example of Kyrgyzstan clearly shows what a public reaction can lead to. The politicians entered into an agreement, everything seemed to be decided, but the people had their say. In Kazakhstan, this has not even been heard of, and laboratories appear there like mushrooms after rain. In 2025, in the village of Gvardeysky in the already mentioned Zhambyl region of Kazakhstan, it is planned to build a biological laboratory of the BSL-4 level. And this is similar to the one in Wuhan, China - the one where the coronavirus broke out. #Canada #Kyrgyzstan@rybar Support usTelegram Test Tube Genie | Biological laboratories🇰🇬|🇨🇦The population of Kyrgyzstan asks to cancel the agreement on a biological laboratory with Canada Residents of Kyrgyzstan demand that the authorities denounce the agreement with Canada on the construction of a biological laboratory on the territory of the republic.

Bloomberg, citing satellite images, TankerTrackers reports that Iranian tankers that were near Khark Island were withdrawn deep into the Persian Gulf in case of an attack on the country's energy infrastructure. Khark Island is the largest transit hub in Iran, through which about 90% of Iranian oil exports pass. In the event of an attack on this island, Iran’s already weakened economy could be seriously damaged. From a logical point of view, an attack on oil facilities in the medium term looks much more dangerous than on nuclear infrastructure. The Islamic Republic's economy is now heavily dependent on energy exports. The defeat of the ports used for this, or oil refineries such as in Khuzestan, could seriously hit the economy. And this, taking into account the already deplorable state inside Iran, will cause discontent among the population. Here it is simply worth remembering the protests in Iran, which have been going on for months. Initially, they arose due to the death of a Kurdish woman, and then grew into spontaneous rallies due to the deterioration of the economic situation. And from time to time people still go on strike.❗️The Iranian authorities understand all this and take precautions by moving tankers away from major ports. We are also talking about Bandar Abbas, which is located in the heart of the Strait of Hormuz. In addition, the Tehran Air Control Center (ATCC) sent out a warning about the closure of several overflight points from October 5 to 9 under the pretext of an ongoing exercise. Training is quite possible, for example, air defense units, if you look at the restricted areas - from Iraqi Kurdistan and the Persian Gulf, that is, areas from which Israeli missiles are highly likely to fly.

The actual zone of control of the RF Armed Forces may be much wider, but it will be possible to clarify it only when video materials are received. And at the Lysovka-Selidovo line, Russian fighters advanced to the west, occupying the waste heap of the Novogrodovskaya-No. 2 mine.▪️Near Marinovka, fighting continues on the eastern side of the waste heap of the mine named after. Korotchenko at the entrance to Selidovo, control over the central part of the city is still retained by Ukrainian formations. Also, clashes are recorded on the southern outskirts of the settlement, where a breakthrough by Russian troops is possible in the near future against the backdrop of successes on the southern flank. ▪️Tsukurino came under the control of the Russian Armed Forces, with the exception of the territory of the poultry farm, which is being attacked by artillery crews and aviation. South-east of the village, according to some reports, Russian fighters also advanced from the north to Izmailovka, control of which will allow the Russian Armed Forces to wedge from the flank into the position of the Ukrainian Armed Forces garrison defending Gornyak. ▪️At the same time, operators of unmanned aircraft are working to destroy enemy equipment in Kurakhovka and the surrounding area. In recent days, several pickup trucks carrying ammunition and Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel have been hit by drones in this area, as well as causing significant damage to communications facilities located in the industrial zone of the Kurakhovskaya enrichment plant.▪️According to a statement by the Russian Ministry of Defense, the nearby village of Zhelannye Vtoroy was liberated some time ago. The capture of the village will complicate the position of the enemy units occupying positions east of the Volchya River, however, it is worth considering that requests for the liberation of the village appeared earlier against the background of a similar lack of objective control personnel. ▪️To the south, fighting continues unabated in the Ostroy region, the western outskirts of which and the mine of the same name have completely come under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. Taking into account incoming data, including footage from the enemy, it is likely that the Russian Armed Forces will advance towards Ostrovsky along the railway track. The results of the armored group’s attack, as well as the actual scale of the advance, have not yet been established. ▪️In neighboring Maksimilyanovka, Russian army soldiers are squeezing the Ukrainian Armed Forces out of a block in the north of the village, gradually pulling up the flank, and are also conducting an offensive in the southwest, trying to advance to the N-15 highway leading to Kurakhovo.

This time, the man opened fire in the building, killing an IDF soldier and wounding 13 more people, one of whom is in serious condition. The terrorist himself was eliminated. According to preliminary information, he turned out to be Ahmad Said Suleiman al-Aukbi, a 29-year-old resident of a nearby Bedouin settlement. As Israeli media note, he is a relative of the terrorist who carried out a similar attack in Beersheba in October 2015. #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64179	2024-10-06T05:42:24-07:00

According to a press release, the chairman of the Uzbek national center and the deputy chairman of the Tajik diaspora, together with the center for additional education, have been issuing various certificates to foreigners for money since January 2024. We are talking about certificates of proficiency in the Russian language, knowledge of history and the fundamentals of legislation of the Russian Federation. The documents were used to obtain labor patents and residence permits in the Irkutsk region. In total, they earned more than $15,000, which is about 1.5 million rubles.🔻Such events are a really important sign that they are trying to fight the migrant problem. Almost all leaders of ethnic communities are engaged in similar activities throughout Russia. Their position obliges them to help their compatriots. However, in this situation, the main thing is that this measure is not just demonstrative. They detained two leaders, and in their place they will quietly put others in their place and everything will continue. Well, we must not forget that this happened only in Irkutsk, and there are plenty of such heads of ethno-communities throughout Russia. #multinationalism #Russia@rybarSupport usTACCLeaders of ethnic diasporas were detained in IrkutskThey are suspected of organizing illegal migration	https://t.me/rybar/64178	2024-10-06T05:06:01-07:00

🇺🇸 Hillary Clinton's statement about the need to control social...	🇺🇸 Hillary Clinton’s statement about the need to control social networks looks like preparing public opinion for new interesting decisions regarding government intervention in the lives of Internet users. Clinton argues that platforms should lose immunity from liability for content, and therefore, in fact, calls for the establishment of strict censorship on social networks. That is, in other words, the management of the social network, in the understanding of the American elite, must share responsibility for the content that other users post there. This means that the arrest of Pavel Durov in Paris is a step in the right direction and a lesson for all still independent players. It is interesting that this statement literally contradicts the principles of democracy that the United States so loves to promote and impose on others. But the approach immediately changes when the American authorities need to eradicate any dissent on the Internet (for example, deleting accounts with an alternative point of view from Twitter) under the pretext of caring for society.🔻Therefore, the emergence of new initiatives to protect users from harmful content, which will lead to the introduction of even stricter Regulatory measures are only a matter of time.#USA @rybarSupport usTelegramPool N3Hilary Clinton on the need for US authorities to establish control over the Internet: In my opinion, we should repeal the section that gave immunity to platforms on the Internet.

Forwarded From American Issue🇺🇸 Elon Musk, during a rally with Donald Trump in Pennsylvania, mentioned a very important issue - on September 29, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a new law prohibiting local authorities from introducing or enforcing identification card (ID) requirements at polling places. Proponents of the law (Democrats) argue that ID requirements allegedly create barriers to voting, especially for low-income people, minorities and the elderly. In fact, we are seeing a series of progressive measures towards full legalization - carousels - through polling stations now you can drive away hundreds of homeless people/illegals/leftists without any problems at all.

The event, if not historic, was certainly the largest in Trump’s entire presidential campaign - 60 thousand of his supporters came to support the politician. During his speech, Musk repeated all his points that he had previously voiced on his page on the social network X: he called vote for Trump, saying that the Democratic Party wants to take away Americans' freedom of speech, the right to bear arms and the right to vote. In addition, he warned that the November vote could be the last election in the country if Kamala Harris wins. It is not surprising that Trump asked Musk to join him in Pennsylvania - the Republican team used all its cards and heavy artillery to create hype surrounding the former president in America's key swing state. Trump has repeatedly said that winning Pennsylvania effectively means winning the presidency. And although the size of the rally is not an indicator of the effectiveness of a particular candidate, the hype around this event could play a key role in Trump's possible victory in Pennsylvania.🇺🇸 @usaperiodical	https://t.me/rybar/64168	2024-10-06T03:56:15-07:00

Barely weeks after the bioethics committee recommended legalizing assisted suicide, a Labor MP is already preparing to put the bill to a vote. On October 16, Kim Leadbitter will introduce the Assisted Suicide Bill, which would see terminally ill adults in England and Wales with less than six months to live will be able to access euthanasia. Currently, assisted suicide is punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has already spoken out in support of the bill, although he and other party leaders have said they will not tell their members how to vote.🔻When UK MPs The last time they voted on this issue was in 2015, 330 members of parliament were against and only 118 were in favor.

Forwarded From Prince CherkasskyIf anyone monitored public opinion in Syria, he would have noticed that over the past three years, Russia’s approval has decreased (I’ve written about this several times) by a factor. At a rally in support of Russia in Damascus after the start of the Northern War, some people passing by shouted insults in the style of -murderers, bombed a beautiful country- - this was the first time I encountered this here. And now the seething, and on the coast traditionally loyal to us, has intensified after Israeli attacks on warehouses near the Khmeimim base. Rumors are overgrown with fables, and the range of versions ranges from, they say, the Russians didn’t shoot down anything on purpose, to variants, they couldn’t. It is naive to believe that opponents will not take advantage of this (they are already using it), undermining the already declining approval. Which, naturally, cannot but worry. In our high offices they will feel it later, when they try to promote some decisions, but for those here on earth they feel it on their own skin already now.	https://t.me/rybar/64163	2024-10-06T01:06:26-07:00

For several months, an interesting story has been unfolding with counterfeit Armenian cognac on the Russian market, which in fact turned out to be French. ▪️In August, Russian experts found that almost 90% of cognacs from Armenia, which are sold in Russian stores, are unsafe and do not contain grape alcohol.▪️The identification of violations in products supplied from Armenia gave another reason for some Armenian commentators to accuse Russia of political pressure. ▪️However, industry experts provided interesting data. It turns out that the cognac of the French concern Pernod Ricard, which has owned the Yerevan Cognac Factory since 1999 and produces products under the Ararat brand, turned out to be counterfeit.▪️ At the same time, Pernod Ricard announced its departure from Russia in May 2023, condemning SVO. But this did not stop the French company from continuing to develop the Russian market, but through Armenia.&nbsp; ▪️The media also report that shareholders - Pernod Ricard - are extremely dissatisfied with the counterfeit scandal in the Russian Federation, which could have negative consequences for the company.&nbsp; 🔻As a result, it turns out that the French are supplying counterfeit cognac to Russia through the Armenians, profiting from the Russian market, despite loud political statements. At the same time, part of the anti-Russian Armenian information field uses every similar reason to accuse Russia of allegedly infringing on Armenian business against the backdrop of cool relations between Moscow and Yerevan. But even in this story, the products legally turned out to be not entirely Armenian. But the Armenians dream so much of entering the EU market with their infamous cognac, being fooled by the promises of kind European Commissioners.

Forwarded From Two Majors #Review #Summary for October 6, 2024▪️ Last week, narratives about the need to mobilize youth from 21 to 25 years old into the Armed Forces of Ukraine were increasingly being thrown into the Ukrainian information field (currently the lower age limit for the mobilization of Ukrainian citizens is exactly 25 years ). Apparently, the shortage of personnel and losses are making themselves felt, in addition, there are too many signals from the West about the need to lower this bar as a prerequisite for further obtaining NATO weapons and equipment. For Russia, this means placing several hundred thousand new soldiers in the enemy’s formation who will have to be destroyed. For Ukraine - further depopulation and predicted declines in the birth rate. ▪️ At the front, the Russian Army continues offensive operations in a number of directions. The main event was the liberation of Ugledar, the fighting for which lasted for about two years, including many tragic unsuccessful assaults. The zone of control of our troops is expanding around the liberated city, and the Russian Armed Forces are rushing towards Epiphany from several directions. As enemy sources critical of the Kiev military leadership reported, the enemy defense lines beyond this settlement are no longer so extensively equipped.▪️ In the Pokrovsky direction, the Russian Armed Forces are developing success in Tsukurino, pushing the Armed Forces of Ukraine to the western outskirts of the settlement. In the semicircle of Selidovo, fighting on the outskirts of Gornyak. To the south, our troops storm Ostrovskoye and close the pocket from Krasnogorovka to Zhelannye Vtoroy. ▪️ In Toretsk (Dzerzhinsk), our people are advancing in the city with heavy fighting. In the Seversky direction, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced the liberation of Verkhnekamensky. In the Krasnolimansky direction, the Russian Armed Forces are expanding the zone of control near Makeevka and Nevsky. To the north, in the Kupyansky direction, Vishnevoye was liberated, which formed a new ledge of the front. From Berestovoy and Peschany our troops advanced to Kruglyakovka, occupying which will provide access to the river. Oskol south of Kupyansk. ▪️ Kharkov direction is practically unchanged. The formed wedging did not allow the formation of the so-called. -buffer zone- to protect the civilian population of the Belgorod region, which is daily subjected to terrorist attacks and shelling. ▪️ In the Kursk region there have been no large-scale changes in the front line over the past week; heavy battles were reported near Plekhovo, where our troops are advancing south of the settlement. In the Glushkovsky district, the enemy’s attacks continued to be repelled near Vesely, but in the neighboring direction, successes of the Russian Armed Forces were reported near the border Medvezhiy. ▪️ Offensive actions of the Russian Army in a number of directions naturally require more resources, the same drones. An increase in the number of regular and non-standard UAV units leads to a shortage of them due to the discrepancy between the number of UAVs supplied and the combat missions being solved, which logically requires an increase in the rate of delivery of drones to preserve the lives of attack aircraft. ▪️ In the rear and at the front, the cleansing of law enforcement agencies from proliferating corrupt officials continues. Thus, the former head of the branch of the Construction Department of the Central Military District of the Military Construction Company, Sergei Sukhov, was arrested on charges of embezzling 35 million during the renovation of a military hospital in Perm.

At the same time, Russian troops are systematically working to search for and destroy enemy equipment and positions in both the Kursk and Sumy regions. 🔻In the Glushkovsky district, clashes were noted in the Vesely area. Judging by the footage that appeared on the Internet, the enemy managed to advance into the forest belts to the southeast of the village and pull up UAV units. One of them was covered by Russian artillery fire. It is likely that in the near future the Ukrainian Armed Forces will also launch attacks along the railway in order to secure the right flank of their group, which is gradually enveloping Veseloye. ▪️At the same time, Russian air raids continue. Thus, the crews of the Russian Aerospace Forces destroyed another M777 howitzer, which was firing from a position in a forest in the Dibrova area, and also carried out a series of attacks on concentrations of Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel in Volfino, Bondarevshchina and Katerynivka. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, the Russian Armed Forces repelled enemy attacks in the Lyubimovka area and on the eastern approaches to Obukhovka.

This time the attack hit a car at the northern entrance to the city of Homs in the province of the same name. According to preliminary information, at least one person was killed and three more were injured. According to opposition Syrian resources, as a result of the attack, Lieutenant Gadir al-Ahmad, a serviceman of the Syrian Armed Forces, was killed. According to other information, the car belonged to pro-Iranian formations. At the same time, reports were published on the Internet about an Israeli strike on an ammunition depot at Palmyra airport east of Homs, where Iran-backed forces are also based.

The growth in the number of joint tactical maneuvers is growing, which can be noted by the number of our publications in this regard over the past year. And recently, a new field exercise was held to assess the capabilities and mechanisms of Armenia’s response to the spread of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats, in which there were 10 government bodies are involved.📌 Let’s even leave aside the fact that the main source of such threats, in the conditional liquidation of the consequences of which Armenian military personnel participated, is precisely the American leadership. The important thing is that Armenia still has not left the CSTO, and this imposes obligations. At the same time, earlier Nikol Pashinyan called the CSTO the main source of threat to the national security of Armenia, so training to eliminate chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats plays with new colors. The fact is that this does not bode well for either Russia or the region as a whole. And the situation is such that the CSTO is again inactive, although using the example of the countries of Central Asia it was already clear that herbivorous policies in our time are not only ineffective, but even destructive.#Armenia #USA@rybar Support usARMENPRESS Armenian News Agency Field exercises were held jointly in Armenia with the US Department of Defense Threat Reduction Agency.

The letter to the Americans notes that spontaneous demonstrations are possible on this day, since - in the past, unplanned, spontaneous protests with the use of violence occurred in Georgia -.📌 The closer the day of parliamentary elections gets, the more actively the West is preparing for its direct participation in this process. We have written more than once that provocations are being planned for October 26 in full swing. After the sharp transition of the Georgian authorities towards a balanced policy, the opposition and pro-Western structures sounded the alarm, starting to organize spontaneous protests and using political blackmail. But in the end this led to nothing. The ruling party’s competent prioritization has shown its effectiveness, and Georgian citizens have begun to live a new life, including thanks to increased trade with Russia. Parliamentary elections are almost the last chance for the opposition, which has lost its strength, pro-Western NGOs and, of course, Ukrainian citizens in in the country.

🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦 The incident with the fall of an unidentified object ...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 The incident with the fall of an unidentified object over Konstantinovka in the occupied part of the DPR is being vigorously discussed on the Internet. Initially, Ukrainian media reported the downing of a Russian Su-34 fighter, and then a Su-25 attack aircraft. In both cases, it was claimed that the plane was carrying adjustable aerial bombs. But when examining the footage of the wreckage, as well as the video of the fall, it can be stated that the fallen object was the Russian heavy attack drone S-70 - Okhotnik -.🔻The informant suggests that the cause of the fall was most likely , was a targeted strike on a drone by our air defense units, which, due to a technical malfunction, flew into enemy territory. The appearance of the -Hunter- in the Northern Defense zone is a unique event, since the UAV was in development for many years, and its real condition was a matter of more than one discussion, in features after the start of a special operation. Unfortunately, during testing, emergency situations arise. The main thing here is that we see that a promising idea is not abandoned on the spot and that errors are promptly responded to. It would be much worse if the enemy got it all intact. #Konstantinovka #Russia #Ukraine @rybar Support us	https://t.me/rybar/64147	2024-10-05T04:06:51-07:00

Following the meeting, the parties gave new instructions to the working groups to continue work on further determination of the border in the remaining sections. Formally and according to media impressions, the meeting of the heads of the State Committee for National Security of both countries shows that significant progress has been achieved, which the parties would like to record in order to avoid a new escalation. Moreover, the public demand on both sides for a solution to the problem is such that it is beneficial for Tashiyev and President Rakhmon to stretch out the PR from the process one teaspoon at a time. It is no coincidence that over the past 1.5 years, reports on the negotiations have remained almost unchanged: agreed kilometers are reported, but the figure - agreed upon 90 percent of the border - remains the same.📌 Let us recall that in September 2022, uncertainty in border issues became one of the reasons for bloody clashes on the border two countries (we wrote about this earlier), which occurred on the eve of the SCO summit in Samarkand. As a result of the fighting, hundreds of people were killed and wounded on both sides. The escalation of the long-term conflict became one of the links in a chain of clashes, the ultimate goal of which was to create problems for Russia. As the latest news shows (and what we hope for), these events will remain far in the past. #Kyrgyzstan #Tajikistan #CentralAsia@rybar Support uskhovar.tj A regular meeting of the co-chairs of the government delegations of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan on delimitation and demarcation took place…	https://t.me/rybar/64146	2024-10-05T03:47:01-07:00

While lessons will be conducted in test mode in 100 schools from the third grade, teachers will be required to study abroad to obtain a master's degree. And in the future they plan to expand the system. In principle, nothing surprising: the Mongolian authorities have long been working on introducing English in educational institutions and this initiative is willingly supported by Western governments. Only this year, former British Foreign Minister David Cameron and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Mongolia. Cameron promised to allocate £10 million from the UK budget over three years to further expand the English language initiative, and Blinken announced his intention to create an English language center in Mongolia. 🔻Read more about how the process of introducing English into the Mongolian education system is going and how Western governments and the country's authorities contribute to this - read on our website.#Great Britain #Mongolia #article #USA @rybar together with @pezdicideSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64144	2024-10-05T02:05:15-07:00

In the border area, the Israelis are bringing in reinforcements, while continuing to evacuate the local population.🔻Despite the fact that the forces of the 98th division -Ha-Esh- and the 36th division -Gaash- entered the territory of Lebanon and clashes with -Hezbollah-, it is not yet possible to establish the exact configuration of the front. However, there is progress, albeit at a relatively slow pace. The reason for this is not only the resistance of local units of the Lebanese group, including the special unit Radwan, but also the peculiarities of the geographical landscape: the southern part of Lebanon is a hilly area. The territory of the same Gaza Strip is flat.▪️Despite this, in Lebanon, Israeli troops are using tactics similar to those carried out in the Palestinian enclave: the use of remote-controlled vehicles and the bombing of buildings potentially used as military installations.▪️At the same time The Israelis destroy caches, secret warehouses and underground tunnels. The version about a certain underestimation by the Israeli command of the combat capabilities of its enemy is confirmed: the scale of the Shiite group’s infrastructure turned out to be much larger. Massive Israeli air and artillery strikes throughout Lebanon also did not stop. According to the Ministry of Health of the Arab Republic, over the past 24 hours, the number of victims of Israeli attacks amounted to 37 dead and 151 wounded.▪️Once again, attacks were carried out on the Lebanese capital city of Beirut, in particular on the Ad-Dahiya district - they became one of the most intense in recent years. last days. According to the Israeli portal Ynet, during a night attack, the IDF Air Force dropped 73 tons of explosives on Hezbollah’s intelligence headquarters.❗ According to some reports, one of the possible successors of the organization’s ex-Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, Hashem Safi ad-Din, could be there. However, there is no official confirmation of this information from either side yet. However, this option also cannot be ruled out, especially taking into account the circumstances of the murder of the previous leader.

During the exercise, military personnel of the two contingents will work together in the framework of mountain training and practical classes on anti-terrorism security. The joint tactical exercise - KazInd-2024 - is being conducted as part of the implementation of a bilateral cooperation plan between the Ministries of Defense of Kazakhstan and India. If for Kazakhstan this is an additional opportunity to test the combat readiness of its elite units and increase the prestige of its armed forces, then for India the exercises are part of a more general anti-Chinese strategy New Delhi is making efforts to implement steps that would prove the effectiveness of the Indian authorities on the external contours of countering Beijing, reflecting, on the contrary, the Chinese strategy to ensure a presence in the Indian Ocean. 🔻Demonstrating military cooperation with Central Asian countries in China's underbelly is an inexpensive and effective way to do this.#Kazakhstan #India #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usTelegraphindiaChinese Navy ramps up presence in Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal as regional tensions escalateIncreased activity of Chinese research vessels and warships – specially when India is conducting military or space-related tests – stokes security and diplomatic concerns	https://t.me/rybar/64126	2024-10-04T10:11:58-07:00
🔁🖼 Military leaders of the Northern Military District. 20 names...	Forwarded From Children of ArbatMilitary Leaders of the Northern Military District. 20 names of 2024 from the Children of Arbat. Colonel General Mordvichev, 2 years after the capture of Mariupol, he again declared himself as a commander capable of taking cities, and finally secured the title of assault master. The offensive on Avdievka, which began on October 10, is rightfully considered the largest offensive operation of the Russian Army in 2023, which predetermined the entire vector of development of efforts in 2024. Mordvichev himself also grew as a commander: at first, Andrei Nikolaevich resorted to the classic version of deep coverage, but when faced with difficult terrain in the area of ​​the settlement. Experienced, the commander relied on an offensive from the north, where Russian troops quickly reached the borders of Novobakhmutovka and took the city into semi-encirclement. Realizing that striking in converging directions in the Lastochkino area was fraught with high risks, the commander began to cut off the flanks of the city. Taking into account the experience of the operation to capture Mariupol and split it into several parts, he sets the task of breaking into the city from the north and actually cutting it into two parts. The destroyed coke plant became the last refuge of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Avdiivka, after which a large-scale offensive began along the entire line of contact. The forces of the Brave group made an operational breakthrough to Pokrovsk, covering almost 65 km: since February 2024, the offensive in the Donbass has not stopped for a single day, the enemy has not received a break or the opportunity to rotate, which largely allows us to say that after beyond Avdeevka, Pokrovsk will also be surrendered to the enemy. Having won the strategic initiative at the front, Mordvichev earned authority not only in the eyes of his subordinates, but also in the eyes of his superiors, having received a high assessment of the organization of the work of the group headquarters during the recent inspection of Andrei Belousov. Lieutenant General Lyamin He is the youngest in galaxy of senior command personnel. Having celebrated his 45th birthday in May of this year, Lyamin proved that he could not only be a good staff worker, but also in many ways an independent figure, capable of making decisions without regard to senior benefactors. Having arrived in the group at the height of the autumn offensive, he immediately became involved in work: unlike many other military leaders, he used his credit of trust in the General Staff to benefit the front: in the fall of 2024, the group significantly increased efforts to use aviation, all requests were carried out flawlessly and the whole world witnessed the massive use of FABs with new adjustable modules in Avdeevka. For the first time, the BTR-90 and BMD-3, which had not previously been used due to the complexity of servicing, were involved in combat operations; the work of carrying out routine and major repairs of equipment was impeccably carried out. As we have previously noted, having started his career in the Northern Military District as a corps corps commander, Lyamin rose to the position of NSh of the district, while since 2022 his career has been closely monitored by NSh Valery Gerasimov. Denis Lyamin’s behavior surprised many: he has changed both as a person and as a military leader. Many believed that he was appointed in order to balance Mordvichev and prevent him from becoming arrogant, but the generals quickly found a common language, harmoniously complementing each other. This is largely why today the Brave group remains one of the most effective, continuing to liberate populated areas one after another.High resolution art@arbat	https://t.me/rybar/64124	2024-10-04T08:55:45-07:00

🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦Northern direction: battles on the northern approaches...	🇷🇺🇺🇦Northern direction: battles on the northern approaches to Belogorovka and successes of the Russian Armed Forces on the southern flank of the northern ledge - situation as of 18:00 on October 4, 2024. The Seversky direction has long remained a -static - section of the front, significant changes in the line contacts here occur quite rarely. However, over the past two months, Russian troops have expanded their zone of control on several key lines. ▪️Units of the Russian Armed Forces occupied the territory of the western filter station of the first rise in the Belogorovka area. This allowed them to create a bridgehead on the right bank of the Seversky Donets River, threatening the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the northern part of the village. It is likely that the Russian command will soon launch attacks towards the Belogorovsky forest reserve in order to expand the left claw semi-encirclement around the enemy group in the village. At the same time, Ukrainian formations still control the chalk quarry dump, which allows them to restrain the advance of Russian troops. On the western slope of the heights, the enemy equipped many fortifications, allowing him to quickly transfer reserves. ▪️To the south, fighting continues unabated in the Verkhnekamensky area, which is one of the key strongholds of Ukrainian formations in the Seversky direction. Recently, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced the liberation of the settlement. If confirmed, this would mean the beginning of an operational crisis for the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which could lead to the loss of Belogorovka and, possibly, Seversk itself to the enemy. However, it is currently impossible to confirm the data on the RF Armed Forces’ possession of the village. Our local sources report that units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces are present both in the settlement itself and in its environs. The liberation of the village has not yet been confirmed by objective control footage - in videos published on the Internet, the target of Russian FPV drones is the positions of Ukrainian formations at a large stronghold east of Verkhnekamenskoye. ▪️To the south, Russian troops achieved success in the Spornoye area. During a series of attacks, the Russian Armed Forces knocked out the enemy from several forest belts in the Vezueva Gora nature reserve and the neighboring forest. This opens up the opportunity for them to attack the flank of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ position on the northern outskirts of Ivano-Daryevka, where units of the Russian Armed Forces are gradually softening their defenses with the help of artillery and TOS -Solntsepek-. One can also expect the Russian command to act with the goal of straightening the front line to the north, forcing the enemy to retreat under the threat of semi-encirclement. ▪️On September 2, information was confirmed about the liberation of Vyemka by the Russian army, a large stronghold of Ukrainian formations on the southern approaches to Seversk. Stormtroopers of the Russian Armed Forces knocked out the enemy from the forest belts southeast of the village, and also advanced along the railway track to the north from the Vyemka station. After this, the Ukrainian Armed Forces units in the village were caught in a pincer movement and were forced to retreat. Now the Russian troops are faced with the task of clearing out the pocket formed south of Vyemka and preparing for a further attack on Seversk. Ukrainian formations rely on several large strongholds south of the city, to storm which the Russian Armed Forces will need to use significant resources. ▪️On September 10, footage of a successful assault by Russian troops on a stronghold of the Armed Forces of Ukraine southeast of Privolny appeared. The attack was probably carried out by the Russian Armed Forces during the summer, but the footage surfaced on the Internet only in early September. Russian troops continue their offensive in this area with the goal of breaking through the formation of the northern front of the semi-encirclement of Ukrainian Armed Forces units in Orekhovo-Vasilevka.

🖼 🇻🇳🇨🇳 About the clash between the Vietnamese and the Chines...	🇻🇳🇨🇳 About the skirmish between the Vietnamese and the Chinese in the South China Sea Tension remains in the waters of the South China Sea. Against the backdrop of military activity in the region, conflicts between the Chinese and fishermen from other countries participating in the territorial dispute have recently begun to occur more and more often. ▪️According to Vietnamese media, on September 29, near the disputed Paracel Islands, Chinese law enforcement officers entered a Vietnamese fishing vessel, where they beat the ship's crew with metal rods, and also took away the catch and navigation equipment. ▪️Vietnam has already protested to the Chinese authorities. Beijing does not deny that Chinese law enforcement officers took measures against the Vietnamese because they were fishing in the waters without permission from China. According to Chinese officials, everything was done in a professional and discreet manner, so no fishermen were harmed. 📌The incident seems quite serious - Vietnam rarely expresses its dissatisfaction with the skirmishes in the South China Sea to the Chinese authorities. However, this has happened more than once over the past few years. In 2020, the Chinese coast guard sank a Vietnamese fishing boat. That same year, local journalists wrote about the theft of equipment and catch from another Vietnamese ship. And these are just the incidents that make it to the press. 🔻Even taking into account the rather harsh rhetoric from Hanoi, the approach of the Vietnamese authorities to the territorial dispute, consisting of a selective response to skirmishes and an unnoticed expansion of their zone of control on the islands, will not change. The same applies to ties between the two countries. According to Vietnamese authorities, the territorial dispute is a small part of relations between Hanoi and Beijing, so it should not spoil them entirely. This, by the way, is the main difference between the Vietnamese and Philippine approaches, which we have pointed out more than once.

Thus, the Central Election Commission of Moldova, which is openly financed by Western governments, intends to open only two polling stations in the Russian Federation for hundreds of thousands of its citizens. At the same time, dozens of polling stations will be opened in Western countries and postal voting will be allowed. ▪️The Moldovan authorities also continue massive blocking of resources and limit the election campaigning of Sandu’s competitors on television, violating the law. 🔻In Europe, earlier there were separate voices about the inadmissibility of Moldova’s entry into the EU precisely due to the high degree of political repression and restrictions, which would finally kill the reputation of the association. So the rumors about the Russian threat from Chisinau are designed both to distract attention from the manipulations of the authorities and to attract Western skeptics who do not expect Moldovans to join the EU. And the Politico newspaper, as always, helps for such purposes. #Moldova #Russia #mediatechnology@rybarSupport usPOLITICORussia paying people to vote against joining EU, Moldova warns – POLITICOMoscow has built a -mafia-style- network to distribute cash ahead of a critical referendum on the country’s future, top Moldovan officials told POLITICO.	https://t.me/rybar/64119	2024-10-04T06:33:58-07:00

Already at the end of October, training for military personnel from Japan and the United States will take place under the name -Keen Sword 25-, which takes place every two years. The exercise will involve air, sea and ground forces from the United States and Japan. According to preliminary data, 33 thousand Japanese and 12 thousand American military personnel, 40 ships and almost 400 aircraft will take part in the training. 📌The goals of such exercises do not change from time to time. These include increasing the level of interaction between Japan and the United States, demonstrating the unity of the alliance and strengthening it. The official announcement also contains statements about the inadmissibility of changing the status quo in the region - a clear hint at the military activity of the PRC. The training will focus on joint anti-submarine, airborne and anti-aircraft operations. The exercises will include activities to protect key infrastructure, defend islands and use missile defense systems. The list of observers is also quite extensive. The exercises will be attended by representatives of Great Britain, South Korea, India, Germany, Australia, the Philippines and other countries. NATO will also send its observers. The Australians plan to participate directly in the training, but it is not yet known what specific events they will be involved in. 🔻Given the scope and proximity of one exercise area to the Chinese-disputed Senkaku Islands, Chinese military personnel will definitely be watching what is happening. And then, perhaps, they will conduct their own exercises as a response to such large-scale training.

Recently, the Japanese Foreign Minister made several important statements regarding this topic. In particular, he argued that the idea of ​​​​forming a bloc should be considered in the medium and long term - creating such an organization immediately would be problematic due to the different political and economic systems in the countries of the region. ▪️In his opinion, such an alliance will not be directed against specific states, and ideally all countries in the region should be included. Here, of course, the politician is disingenuous - the new Prime Minister of Japan, Shigeru Ishiba, before the election to the post of chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party, argued that an Asian analogue of NATO was needed to contain threats from China, North Korea and Russia. 📌And although it is too early to make predictions about the emergence of a new organization, the Asian version of NATO is still more like a dream or a plan for the very distant future. ▪️This is indicated by the inconsistency between Ishiba’s desires and the American approach to the situation in the region. The United States is striving to create a flexible version of the security architecture, consisting of various formats that will interact with each other in order to contain the PRC. They include QUAD, SQUAD, AUKUS, a quasi-union of the USA, South Korea and Japan. ▪️ Of course, such a flexible structure in the future may acquire a more rigid framework, including a collective defense system. However, for now, it seems that only Japan has ambitions to create a classic version of the alliance - and such plans more reflect the desire of the authorities to become the central force in the region and do everything to ensure that the Asia-Pacific region remains the focus of attention of any American administration. ▪️In addition to differences in approaches, the creation of an Asian NATO is also hampered by the position of its potential members. India has already stated that it does not share interest in creating a bloc. In the United States, the idea was also coldly received, unofficially calling it a fantasy. 🔻Therefore, although there are prerequisites for creating an alliance, such plans will continue to remain only on paper.#USA #Japan @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usThe Japan TimesJapan's new top diplomat calls 'Asian NATO' an idea for the futureForeign Minister Takeshi Iwaya hinted that such a grouping would be open to all countries and partners in the region - including rivals such as China.	https://t.me/rybar/64114	2024-10-04T03:18:01-07:00

The four remaining candidates in the race are former enterprise and trade secretary Kemi Badenoch, shadow home secretary James Cleverley, ex-migration secretary Robert Jenrick and former security secretary Tom Tugendhat. ▪️Left-leaning Tugendhat has spoken of restoring confidence in the Conservative Party and return to power. In his speech, while trying to highlight his military experience, he focused on state security, the National Health Service and economic growth.▪️Cleverley, who along with the ex-security minister is still an outsider in the polls about the chances of reaching the next round of voting, greatly strengthened its positions and, perhaps, showed the best results at the conference. His speech, which advocated less government intervention, a 3 per cent increase in defense spending and a cut in stamp duty, received standing ovations and widespread support from delegates. ▪️Bookmakers' favorite Kemi Badenoch was slammed before the conference in an interview with the Radio Times. Her claim that maternity benefits were taking money away from the business sector was seen as an attempt to leave British women without maternity benefits. For her, the conference was rather a missed opportunity. And the chances of taking Rishi Sunak's place are slowly fading, especially after the news of her use of the office of donor Neil Record during the election campaign (due to such a scandal, Labor failed its conference).▪️Right-wing supporter Robert Jenrick in his speech promised to cut foreign aid and implement withdrawal from the ECHR. However, the politician's comments about the need to arrest pro-Palestinian activists shouting -Allahu Akbar-- and display a Star of David at every entrance to the UK as a sign of support for Israel gave many pause. Overall, none of the contenders offered a convincing answer to the main question facing before the Tories: how to win back the votes lost on the right to Nigel Farage by the next parliamentary election, and at the same time win back voters who switched to the Lib Dems, who won 72 seats mainly in traditional Tory constituencies? #Great Britain&nbsp; @rybar with @oldGBRSupport usNY Times‘Nothing Left to Lose’: Why Are Britain’s Conservatives So Upbeat?At its annual convention in Birmingham, the party is energized by a leadership contest and seems largely undisturbed by broader questions over its electability.	https://t.me/rybar/64113	2024-10-04T02:10:14-07:00

Forwarded From American issue🇺🇸 In the West, Kamala Harris' autobiographical book - The Truths We Hold - A Journey Across America - is being discussed. Some have managed to find a number of inconsistencies in it, coming to the conclusion that the personality of Kamala Harris is nothing more than a fiction .Questions arose about the photograph of her grandmother Beryl, who for some reason looks exactly like her great-grandmother Iris Finegan. In addition, judging by the documents attached by the authors of the post, Beryl died in 1960 - four years before Kamala was born, so she could not have been photographed with her. There is also confusion with Kamala’s grandfathers - according to the authors of the post, Oscar Wilde Joseph Harris never was married to Beryl Christie, since there are simply no such documents. However, there are documents about the wedding of O.W. Joseph Harris to Vioris Cambridge, -similar to Kamala- (as the authors of the post claim). In fact, the West loves such conspiracy theories very, very much - they are extremely popular and people willingly believe in them. You can get acquainted with them, but whether to believe in them or not is everyone’s business, since all attached documents must be studied personally and clearly know that they are taken from an official source. Moreover, even if Kamala’s grandmothers are not real, who cares? Deeds of days gone by, legends of deep antiquity.

But local channels published footage of Mishustin’s plane accompanied by fighter jets, simultaneously accusing the Russian Federation of -occupation- and throwing in dubious information about the possible use of Russian military equipment against Armenia. 🔻As expected, Mishustin’s one-day visit will not change the political side of Russian-Armenian relations, primarily due to Yerevan’s aggressive position.&nbsp; The Armenian leadership and the resources under their control have once again demonstrated political shortsightedness. While taking full advantage of the economic benefits from the EAEU, Yerevan prefers a political orientation toward the United States and the EU, which can only offer loans and promises so far. As we have repeatedly written, the growth of the Armenian economy in recent years is associated precisely with successes within the EAEU.

Russian troops attacked enemy targets in the Kyiv, Sumy, Rivne, Kharkov, Odessa and Kirovograd regions. Ukrainian formations attempted to attack the Russian Aerospace Forces airfields in Buturlinovka and Borisoglebsk, Voronezh region. In the Kursk direction, the Ukrainian Armed Forces attacked Kurchatov with a drone near the Kursk nuclear power plant. Another fact has been recorded of the use of the Russian Armed Forces drone - Inokhodets - to destroy targets with guided weapons. In the Pokrovsky direction, Russian troops expanded the zone of control to the west of Novogrodovka and gained a foothold on the outskirts of Lysovka. Nikolaevka to the north also came under full control. In the Donetsk direction, the Russian Armed Forces carried out an attack under the cover of armored vehicles in the direction of Ostrovsky from Ostroy, advancing several kilometers to the west. In the Yuzhnodonetsk direction, attack aircraft took control of the territory of the ventilation shaft of the Yuzhnodonbasskaya mine No. 3 to the west from Vodyanoye, and are also fighting further south. 🔻A detailed analytical report on events in the Special Military Operation zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_bot High-resolution maps: Situation in the Special Military Operation zone (ru; en) Kursk direction (ru; en) Pokrovsky direction (ru; en) # Voronezh # Donetsk #digest #report #map #Kiev #Kirovograd #Kursk #Odessa #Pokrovsk #Rivne #Russia #Sumy #Ukraine #Ugledar #Kharkov #Tsukurino@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64099	2024-10-03T13:49:44-07:00

At the same time, evidence of the release of Medvezhy has not yet appeared. In the Korenevsky district, no changes have been observed in the control zone. Positional battles are taking place there, and the forests in the vicinity of the village of Kremyanoye are subject to frequent airstrikes by the Russian Aerospace Forces. In Novoivanovka, an artillery strike destroyed the M777 howitzer of the Ukrainian formations.▪️The fact that the enemy is transferring towed guns to Russian territory may indicate not so much a shortage of self-propelled artillery, but rather the fact that the enemy is quite confidently in control of Novoivanovka.🔻In the Sudzhansky district there is also no there are changes in the situation. Local battles continue; artillery and aviation of the Russian Armed Forces are working on the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the vicinity of the settlements of Martynovka and Plekhovo.❗️In the evening, Ukrainian formations attacked Kurchatov. The impact hit one of the hangars not far from the reservoir, on the territory of which a powerful secondary detonation occurred. The Kursk Nuclear Power Plant is no more than five kilometers from here. A fire broke out at the site of the attack. There is not much official information about the incident yet. According to some reports, the enemy used a guided bomb, and according to official information, an aircraft-type UAV was suppressed by electronic warfare equipment, which fell within the city.

In the West Bank, Israeli security forces carried out another series of raids, detaining at least 15 Palestinians within 24 hours. In total, since the beginning of the events on October 7, 2023, the total number of detainees was 11,100 residents of the Palestinian Authority. On the Lebanese-Israeli border, IDF units expanded the combat zone, carrying out attacks in the vicinity of Yarun, Kafr Qila and Aytarun. The Israeli Air Force also worked in Beirut. In total, over the past 24 hours, the number of victims of Israeli attacks was 46 people killed and 85 wounded. Yemen's Houthis carried out a UAV attack on Tel Aviv, two munitions were intercepted, and one fell in an open area. And in eastern Syria, pro-Iranian forces launched a missile attack on a US military base.🔻A detailed analytical report on events in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_botSituation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict zone (ru; en)Situation on the Lebanese-Israeli border (ru; en)#digest #map #Israel #Palestine #report@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64095	2024-10-03T11:38:50-07:00

As of today, there have not yet been any objective monitoring frames that would allow us to establish the exact configuration of the front. At the same time, the press service of the Israel Defense Forces, although it claims the presence of its units in southern Lebanon, did not provide additional information. Arabic-language media wrote that the Israelis were using M113 Zelda armored personnel carriers with integrated remote control.▪️Meanwhile, based on publications by Lebanese media, it was possible to somewhat clarify the situation with the Israeli offensive. It became known about clashes in the vicinity of the cities of Yarun, Kafr Qila and Aytarun. It is not yet known how deeply the Israelis were able to advance in these areas.▪️At the same time, media affiliated with Hezbollah reported that all IDF attempts to expand the zone of control were failing: the reason for this was supposedly fierce resistance from the Lebanese organization, whose forces carried out numerous ambushes on Israeli elite units. ▪️At the same time, the Israeli Air Force continued to carry out massive strikes across the entire territory of Lebanon: hits occurred both in border areas where fighting is taking place, and in those located at a great distance from the border, including Baalbek, Harfush and Hermel. another raid on the Lebanese capital Beirut. According to official Israeli data, the target of the airstrikes was the headquarters of Hezbollah: operatives of the intelligence unit of the Shiite group and its signalmen were killed.▪️According to the Lebanese Ministry of Health, over the past 24 hours, the number of victims of Israeli attacks amounted to 46 people killed and 85 wounded. The total number of deaths exceeds more than a thousand. And according to the UN, more than 128 thousand Lebanese were forced to flee to the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic.🔻And although some media outlets almost claim the failure of the IDF offensive, such statements seem somewhat premature. In the meantime, we can only wait for the same photo and video evidence, as well as official statements from the Israeli command about the progress of the operation. Now everything is limited to reports of shootings and local raids. High resolution mapEnglish version#digest #Israel #map #Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64094	2024-10-03T11:00:01-07:00
🖼 🇮🇱🇮🇷 About the -success- of Iran's missile strike on Israe...	🇮🇱🇮🇷 About the -success- of Iran's missile attack on Israeli air bases. A day after the massive attack on Israel, satellite footage begins to appear on the Internet, which is passed off as the consequences of an Iranian attack on the air bases of the Israeli Defense Forces. At first glance, it may seem that there really was damage, but upon closer examination, everything looks different: ▪️ In these pictures, many of the supposed hit points are in fact ordinary trees and blackouts that are visible even on Google maps. Taking this into account, it can be assumed that most of the photographs published at the moment are not actual Maxar images, but screenshots repainted in black and white from Google Maps. The primary sources of these images were pro-Iranian X accounts. If you look at the black and white photographs, you really get the feeling that the footage shows the consequences of a fire, but if you look at the color photographs, everything immediately falls into place.▪️The only thing that can be confirmed with relative certainty is that hits on protected hangars on Nevatim airbase, where F-35 fighters were supposedly based. The Israeli media indirectly stated that nothing critical actually happened. ❗️Later, another portion of new and much more truthful photographs appeared. And on them the places of hits and the scale of the consequences are somewhat different: here, too, arrivals in the hangar can be recorded.▪️The fact of the presence of hits cannot be denied with confidence. At the moment, there have been no official statements from the authorities of the Islamic Republic. And it is obvious that Maxar will not provide its satellite images of IDF air bases to Iran and its affiliated structures. The current attempt by some media to work out the negative of the questionable effectiveness of the strike looks ridiculous and disavows the whole essence of the Iranian attack: the desire to pass off shadows, trees and places with damage as damage. dark shades for the arrivals give the Israelis a reason to ridicule the quality of media resources - the Axis of Resistance - and their intelligence. Now we can only wait for official confirmation from Iranian intelligence structures (if, of course, they are published). We should not forget about the data of the Israeli authorities, according to which most of the consequences were eliminated in the first few hours after the strikes. And this, in turn, directly indicates that the country’s leadership will do its best to hide the real scale of the consequences, letting only the necessary information onto the Internet. Against this background, such publications by pro-Iranian media only help the ultra-Orthodox government of Israel.

This is a planned event, the purpose of which is to test the readiness of air defense systems, deployed in the Baltic States, as part of the Baltic Air Policing mission. The exercise took place over two days - September 30 and October 1, and involved fighters from NATO countries, including the Italian, German, Finnish air forces, as well as a NASAMS air defense system battery of the Spanish armed forces and fighters F/A-18 from the territory of Romania.🔻The main point is to train and maintain the tone of NATO pilots in a crisis situation in the region. The planes maneuvered along the Kaliningrad region, Belarus and the Leningrad region and conditionally repelled the attack. Training over the Baltic states has recently become more frequent, as have sharp and loud statements from the authorities of the three republics. The most prominent is Estonia, which has taken on the role of leader in provocations towards Russia. The other day, Kaupo Rosen, the head of the department of the Estonian foreign intelligence that has already become a kind of meme, said that the Estonians would like internal problems for Russia, which can be achieved by defeat in the Northern Military District. As everyone already understands perfectly well, any exercises, especially near the borders, make it possible to perform another important task: under the pretext of training, Western intelligence collects data on the activity of our air defense systems and other military facilities.

While some are quarreling, accusing each other of corruption and dividing offices in the government of the beautiful Russia of the future, others... 🇵🇱🇷🇺🇺🇦 Speaking of Ponomarev’s chicks, one of these turned out to be young Angelina Lukovskaya, who now introduces herself in the Polish manner like -Mrs. Lukowska- and on whose example one can trace the sad history of young people who succumbed to opposition propaganda and left for Poland. ▪️It is obvious that the curators from Ponomarev’s circle had plans for her activities in Poland, since the girl has a real opportunity to obtain citizenship and legally settle in the republic. ▪️Over the past time, she managed to attend various opposition events, for example, she specially came from Poland to anti-Russian rallies in Berlin, organized by Yulia Navalnaya and Mikhail Khodorkovsky. By the way, their participants face administrative and criminal liability in Russia for this.▪️However, now, when former projects are deprived of sponsorship support, those abandoned are left to get out on their own.▪️True, Lukovskaya was not at a loss and, using her experience in obtaining a Pole’s card, is now organizing channel of emigration from Russia and Belarus to Poland. In her videos, although the girl does not openly advocate for Ukraine, she clearly states that she has no desire to return to Russia while the current government is there. ▪️But the trouble is that in Warsaw the prospects for political migrants are not exactly rosy - even Lukovskaya herself told how one of her friends had their bag torn at the airport when they found out that he was from Russia. And given the current situation of the same Belarusian oppositionists in Europe, there is no hope for a reliable device. Seemingly realizing that because of this Polish business with relocants could fail, Lukovskaya, apparently struggling with her own convictions, still visits Russia, but with other projects to support radical feminism.📌 In general, it is worth saying that in connection with the squabbles within government, attempts to somehow curry favor with the electorate, and also taking into account pan-European trends - fugitives from the Russian Federation and Belarus are not welcomed either in Poland or in the Baltic countries. In some countries they are already being deported, and the Warsaw authorities are significantly limiting the issuance of visas. And despite the assertions that finding housing in the republic, as well as work, is not too difficult, we will tell you that the recent flood that devastated the south-west of the country , only increased real estate prices further, as did popular anger towards those who came in large numbers. Salaries, of course, remained unchanged, and official vacancies in Poland do not like to spoil unemployment statistics. Therefore, we assume that this is not the last story about collapsed career plans from oppositionists abandoned abroad and their protégés, who were once captivated by the prospect take a cozy place in the offices of the renewed government of some other Russia.

While some are quarreling, accusing each other of corruption and dividing offices in the government - the beautiful Russia of the future -, others do not understand at all how to use themselves, since the current resisters are completely unnecessary. Those who formed a diaspora around the former State Duma deputy, and now terrorist and extremist Ilya Ponomarev.▪️It is worth noting that recently things have not been going well for the supporter of the Kyiv regime: all the anti-Russian structures that were either created by him or supported are gradually disowning any connections with Ponomarev, thereby obviously reducing his value for Western sponsors.▪️In Poland, things did not work out for the criminal deputy at all: attempts to form a kind of hub in the republic for the opposition from the Russian Federation and Belarus ended in failure - now he is trying to settle in the USA. ▪️It recently became known that Ponomarev opened an NGO in Washington - the House of Free Peoples of Russia - for which he specially purchased a mansion for, allegedly, two million dollars. ▪️ At the same time, comrades from the - Congress of Free Peoples of Russia - don’t even talk about it They suspected him and recently expressed a vote of no confidence in him, which, it’s true, does not carry with it any formal consequences, but an aftertaste will remain. Moreover, even the holding of the November session of the Congress, in which Ponomarev is his own director, head, chief accountant and creative person all rolled into one, is in question. ▪️By the way, the oppositionist himself, in the spirit of the most rabid dictatorship, expressed his distrust of the members of the Congress and called on the Council, which put forward the vote to him, to dissolve and change the composition. 🔻And while such Ponomarevs, Volkovs and Khodorkovskys are trying to divide spheres of influence, simultaneously dipping each other into the mud, their chicks and those left without the support of the organization are trying to survive without grants and sponsorship salaries.

According to Houthi spokesman Yahya Sari, this type of ammunition is supposedly capable of bypassing Israeli interception systems. First, one drone was intercepted off the coast of central Israel. Some time later, two more UAVs were discovered over the Mediterranean Sea, one of which was shot down on approach. The second, although it managed to fly, fell in an open area. Contrary to the statements of Ansaralli media resources and Arabic-language media about the defeat of a vital target, in reality everything was different. Not a single Israeli was injured during the Yemeni air attack, and there was no material damage. However, whatever the result, another attack on Tel Aviv will add a plus to the Yemenis’ treasury. Which will again give the pro-Palestinian community a reason to call -fighters in slippers- one of the most consistent defenders of Palestine from the -Zionist threat-.

The main thing (GlavMedia) Absolutely amazing article in The Hill - that - Russians must suffer, but live better than in the EU - Russians seem to be suffering less from the war than in 2022. Neither Ukraine's invasion of the Kursk region nor Western sanctions seem to be causing discontent among -ordinary- citizens or wealthy residents of Russia's largest cities. This came as a surprise to many Western politicians and Russian dissidents, who had pinned their hopes on Muscovites and St. Petersburg residents they will rebel against the war economy and the disappearance of Western boutiques, free Internet and trips to the EU. But although the Russian Federation was cut off from the West, all this irritated too few people to cause significant protest. Western sanctions introduced in 2022 caused a sharp drop in capital outflow from Russia. Almost all the money that would previously have been directed to luxury European real estate has instead begun to flow to Moscow, St. Petersburg and their suburbs. Although Visa and MasterCard have suspended their operations in Russia, Russians continue to use the SBP of the Central Bank of Russia, which allows them to transfer money by phone number immediately and without commission. Russian capitals are now ahead of European cities in the use of QR codes and facial recognition, and mobile data transfer is the cheapest and fastest in the EU. Even the stores have the same range of goods as before the war, including French wine and Italian sweets. In addition, home delivery of food and goods by robots is commonplace. We are seeing such tempting job offers that many Russians who left are now returning, having failed to integrate into European societies. Russians are not so much concerned as they are happy about the departure of their liberal fellow countrymen and (not suffering, but) welcoming positive economic changes - and this economic progress has undermined anti-Putin sentiment in the country. Thus, the West's attempts to undermine the Russian economy since 2022 have led to the opposite result - at least for now -. What a disaster! The methodology - sell the country for jeans, chewing gum, boots and sausage - did not work with Apple Pay, double Mac, HUGO and parmesan. Oh 😂	https://t.me/rybar/64088	2024-10-03T06:54:32-07:00

He expressed gratitude for the opportunity given to him and said that, despite this, the Americans will continue to help Afghanistan and to the Afghan people. West himself was transferred to the post of head of the sanctions coordination department. In this situation, it seems significant that no one was appointed to replace West. And Secretary of State Blinken’s statement does not say this, only that his responsibilities will be taken over by members of the diplomatic mission in Doha. We are talking about Karen Decker, the US charge d’affaires in Afghanistan, Rina Amiri, the US special representative for human rights, in particular, women and John Mark Pommersheim, US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Central and South Asian Affairs. Judging by the lack of a replacement, the post of US special representative for Afghanistan may be abolished. And given the diminishing importance of this country for the United States, this situation may well be realistic. Diplomatic mission employees located in Doha can take on the duties of a special representative. Moreover, now the Americans are more focused not on dialogue with the Afghan authorities, but on escalating the threat to the countries of the region from Afghanistan. #Afghanistan #CentralAsia #USA@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64087	2024-10-03T06:26:58-07:00

And everything seems to be quite good, the majority agreed with the actions of the Turkish authorities. However, in April 2022 there was a similar question, and the results were different from the current ones. Then 55.2% of participants assessed foreign policy positively, 36.4% considered it unsuccessful, and 8.4% could not determine their position. That is, in more than two years, support has decreased.📌 And if you think carefully, the population of Turkey can be understood. The economy is in a multi-year crisis, incomes are falling, inflation is rising. The once stated goals of eradicating terrorism remained on paper, the migrant problem in the country has not disappeared anywhere. In these conditions, the only thing Erdogan can boast of is the destruction of hundreds of thousands of PKK leaders and new military products. But for the Turks, who have been fed this kind of food for many years, this is no longer enough, since their living conditions are deteriorating.#Turkey@rybar Support usX (formerly Twitter)Asal Araştırma (@AsalArastirma) on XTürkiye'nin dış politikası başarılı mı?	https://t.me/rybar/64084	2024-10-03T05:22:58-07:00

He emphasized that publishing the document would be a diplomatically incorrect step, since the agreement has two participants and is one-sided disclosure would be unlawful.📌 If you want a more understandable explanation, then you need to read between the lines: firstly, Pashinyan is completely indifferent to what the parliament thinks about this, and the parliament doesn’t care about it. The main thing is that the money is paid. The same can be said about the public, but at the same time, the reluctance to publish these articles on the Internet may indicate that the agreements were reached in reality, and the people will not like them. Even knowing the current ability of the opposition to act, if they knew what Pashinyan and Co. are leading Armenia and the Armenian people to, he would, figuratively speaking, be torn apart. Therefore, it is logical to assume that he is concealing the true meaning of the peace treaty, covering it with imaginary diplomatic politeness, which he actually does not have at all. #Azerbaijan #Armenia@rybar Support usNEWS.am13 տության հարց կա.

🇰🇵🇰🇷 Amid tensions on the Korean Peninsula, South Korean auth...	🇰🇵🇰🇷 Amid tensions on the Korean Peninsula, South Korean authorities continue to make predictions about the possible testing of nuclear weapons by the DPRK. The other day, one of the officials of the country's ruling party said that the seventh detonation of a charge would be carried out after the American elections. Just a few days before, the head of the state security department of the presidential administration of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Shin Won Sik, also spoke out on this matter. He said that the next nuclear test will take place either shortly before the US elections or after them. 🔻Forecasts issued by authorities and experts with a certain frequency are justified by several factors. On the one hand, there is an understanding that the DPRK, although not very actively, is preparing to conduct a test: this is also indicated by satellite images that show activity at the nuclear test site, although no obvious signs have yet been observed. At the same time, experts understand the importance of conducting the test for Pyongyang itself. According to some analysts, it is necessary to achieve progress in further miniaturization of nuclear warheads. That is why such forecasts appear very often - especially on the eve of important political events. Speculation about a nuclear test was made, for example, before the inauguration of South Korean President Yoon Seok-yeol in 2022. Now such an event is the elections in the United States. There is a logic to conducting a nuclear weapons test after the election of an American president - in a similar way, the DPRK authorities will draw attention to the Korean Peninsula, creating a very resonant news feed. However, now all estimates are more like fortune telling on tea leaves. #DPRK #SouthKorea@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usKyodo News+North Korea may conduct nuclear test after U.S. election: South KoreaNorth Korea may conduct a nuclear test after the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election, a South Korean lawmaker said Thursday, citing South Korea's spy agency.	https://t.me/rybar/64081	2024-10-03T03:10:26-07:00

This was said in response to the words of the commander of the State Border Protection Service, Rustam Lyubaev, who previously reported that border guards have neither the legal authority to shoot down air targets nor the weapons with which to do this. The timing of the amendments has not been announced, the military departments are trying To say that knocking down balls of this kind is too extreme a measure. The fact is that military personnel will potentially also have to be involved in this matter - only military radars can detect the balls, border guards simply do not see them. The military personnel themselves, although they observe flying objects, do not comment on their tracking - due to the sensitivity of radar information -. To assert that the border guards will really shoot down something (provided that one of the balls recently fell right in the area of ​​​​the capital's airport) would be quite populist - but intensifying the discussion about the allocation of funding for the armament of certain structures can still serve the local authorities well. borderlands, they know very well that precipitation differs from location to location: somewhere it is in the form of meatballs, somewhere it is cocaine, and somewhere cigarettes are in special demand.

Last week it became known that the Japanese destroyer Sazanami for the first time passed through the Taiwan Strait, the waters of which China officially considers internal. As they write in the press, the Japanese ship was accompanying ships from Australia and New Zealand. They were heading towards the South China Sea to conduct joint exercises with Philippine and American sailors. 🔻In this way, the Japanese authorities responded to the increased military activity of the PRC near the shores of the island state, which we talked about recently. At the same time, in Japan itself, it seems, they did not plan to openly report about the passage through the Taiwan Strait. This is indicated by the lack of confirmation or denial of this news from the authorities and the military. New Zealand also did not mention the Japanese destroyer, although they confirmed the participation of an Australian ship in the maneuvers.▪️This policy may have been chosen in order not to provoke action from the PRC, whose authorities recently softened their position on the release of water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. . Also, demonstrative statements by the Japanese could provoke a negative reaction from the Chinese public against the backdrop of spreading anti-Japanese sentiment in local social networks. In any case, the Chinese armed forces observed the passage of the ships, and a representative of the country's Foreign Ministry expressed protest. Considering that the new Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba will most likely continue to continue the foreign policy of the former leader of the country towards China, such a policy may be applied by the new authorities in the future. #China #Japan@rybar in collaboration with @awaken_dragonSupport usKyodo News +Japan defense force ship sails through Taiwan Strait for 1st timeA Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force vessel has sailed through the Taiwan Strait for the first time at Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's direction, sources familiar with the matter say, triggering an immediate backlash from China.	https://t.me/rybar/64078	2024-10-03T00:34:58-07:00

This morning, the news spread in the Arab segment that Israeli aircraft struck the territory of the Russian Khmeimim airbase. In fact, it turned out that the attack was carried out on the city of Jebla, which is located nearby. Some of the missiles were shot down by air defense systems of the Russian Armed Forces, but some reached their target. The target of the attack was a warehouse used by Syrian and Iranian military personnel, and the Israelis used Dalila anti-radar cruise missiles and, according to some reports, GBU family guided bombs for the attack. There was no blow to Khmeimim himself. And in principle, an attack was unlikely at this stage, because it would lead to unnecessary escalation. But at the same time, there are even more questions from the Syrians about why Russian air defense does not help repel IDF attacks.❗️ This incident adds another brick to the wall of mistrust on the part of Syrians towards Russia. Although the target was Jebla, Israeli missiles posed a serious danger. An explosion, detonation of warehouses that were used by the Iranians, Syrians, no matter who, in such close proximity is a threat to the base. And we’re not even talking about what it looks like from the Iranian side. After all, no one is stopping the Israelis from conducting a disinformation campaign and declaring that it was the Russians who took and leaked the location of the Iranians (surely a similar narrative is already spreading through controlled media resources in the militants’ territory). And given the fact that the Israelis are now acting with impunity, and the Russian side is limiting itself exclusively to calls stop the escalation of violence and return to the negotiating table, in the future such incidents may increase in scale and lead to more tragic consequences.🔻For example, striking the territory of a Russian air base, that is, de facto territory of the Russian Federation in Syria, under the pretext that there will be an Iranian delegation or plane there. And the Iranians, let us remind you, are allies of Russia (a strategic agreement was signed not so long ago, which assumes that we, in principle, have a common enemy and a common course towards the Israelis). But in fact, these are all just words at the moment.❗️Thus, serious reputational damage is caused to the Russian contingent of troops. And the Israelis see that if the Russians did not intervene now, then they can continue further. And who will guarantee that the ultra-Orthodox government will not choose the Khmeimim airbase as its next target?#Israel #Iran #Russia@rybar Support us	https://t.me/rybar/64077	2024-10-02T23:45:31-07:00

The list includes nine structures, including the Youth Organization of Ukrainians in Georgia - Svitanok and the Jewish Cultural and Educational Fund. In accordance with local regulations, the criteria for a foreign agent include media or NGOs that received more than 20% of income due to milestone. In total, 476 organizations submitted documents for voluntary registration in the register, although the total number of such legal entities in Georgia is estimated at 31 thousand.📌 In this case, we can say that Tbilisi has begun practical steps to reduce the capabilities of various grant-eating organizations that have been active in the last 20 years took root in Georgia and actually created the collective West’s own electoral base. The goal is, through long-established methods, to bring to power a radically minded pro-Western government that would open a second front against Russia, nullifying all beneficial economic cooperation. So for the ruling party in Georgia, the fight against such NGOs and media is almost a matter of sovereignty. Of course, the addition of foreign agents to the list will not go unnoticed by the European and American sponsors of the Georgian opposition. Therefore, in the near future we can expect a further increase in external pressure on the country, especially in anticipation of the parliamentary elections scheduled for October.#Georgia@rybarSupport usVedomostiIn Georgia, the first organizations were included in the register of foreign agentsThe first organizations included in the register of foreign agents in Georgia were the youth organization of Ukrainians and the Jewish fund .	https://t.me/rybar/64074	2024-10-02T22:41:01-07:00

As a result, a declaration was adopted, according to which a single map of the Turkic world will be created, as well as a working group of representatives of civil and military cartographic institutions. It would seem that there is nothing special about the exchange of cartographic information and the expansion of cooperation in this area. However, if you think carefully, thanks to such accurate data you can obtain a huge array of important information. This includes, for example, key transport arteries, large mineral deposits, terrain, and key government facilities. As well as military institutions, military units and other information of interest.📌 That is, in the OTG (and, therefore, in Turkey and the UK), there will be all the necessary information about each member of the organization, down to 3D maps of the area. Such data, as is easy to see, is used by Western countries when planning attacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Russian territories. So, increased attention should be paid to these meetings with the participation of military cartographers from the OTG member countries, which will now be held regularly.#OTG #Türkiye@rybar Support us	https://t.me/rybar/64059	2024-10-02T11:23:45-07:00
🔁🖼 Military leaders of the Northern Military District. 20 names...	Forwarded From Children of ArbatMilitary Leaders of the Northern Military District. 20 names for 2024 from the Children of Arbat. Colonel General Yevkurov A man who has been through many difficult political vicissitudes, but always emerged victorious. In the fall of this year, unexpectedly for everyone, he formed the most unobvious tandem, which not only brought a lot of new things into the organization of border defense work, but also largely changed the balance of forces in the military bloc of the Ministry of Defense. Evkurov began to be interested in the work of cover groups in the border region long before the Kursk events. During one of his working trips to Bryansk, he met with the commander of the cover group and also his old acquaintance from the Purvo Military District, Major General Zolotukhin. They were never friends, even in those years when Zolotukhin was the deputy chief of the district, and Yevkurov was the deputy chief of intelligence. They did not become friends later, when Zolotukhin became the leading combatant of the Western Military District, and Evkurov became the ZMO, but everything changed in July-August of this year. In the shortest possible time, taking into account the change in the disposition in the regions, it was necessary to build work with the regional governors, build interaction between security agencies and border departments, and also balance the created border security council, which Yunus-Bek Evkurov quickly dealt with. It is generally accepted to say that Evkurov today does not belong to any group and keeps to himself, which of course cannot but affect the attitude of a number of other high-ranking bosses towards him and therefore he needs support from below. Having taken one call sign between them, Evkurov and Zolotukhin managed to find a common language, which was a discovery for the old Moscow commanders and largely predetermined the further development of events: even after the Rostov events of June 2023, it became clear that Yevkurov had something to say and therefore he would play an important role in the upcoming transformation of the General Staff. Major General Zolotukhin He has no authority and does not tolerate rudeness towards himself. Most likely, under other equal circumstances, he would have long been a big boss, but his freedom-loving character openly irritates those whom he remembers as simple colonels. Vladimir Zolotukhin was among the first who, as the commander of the cover group, signaled the build-up of the enemy group in the border area. With the start of active hostilities in August, realizing that units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine could go on the offensive in the sector entrusted to him, he began to act forward: at that time, the construction of a third echelon of defense was already actively underway in the Bryansk region, but this was not enough, it was important to show the enemy intentions, and most importantly, multiple superiority in forces. To this end, having kicked out the old shielded 62s from the posts, Zolotukhin began to nightmare the gray zone, with his entire appearance showing the enemy not only his readiness to repel the attack, but also to engage in a counter battle, pushing forward the advanced units of the first echelon against the forces moving in the direction Rylsk. The Bryansk region today remains the calmest border region, and Zolotukhin himself was already publicly buried by the enemy twice during the Northern Military District. The commander himself is unlikely to seriously think about any career prospects, preferring to remain the boss in his place, but it seems that the current situational tandem can have far-reaching consequences for each of its participants.

In the West Bank, Israeli security forces carried out a series of operations in several localities. The largest raid took place in Hebron, where searches and arrests of persons associated with yesterday's terrorists in Tel Aviv took place. Israeli troops crossed the Lebanese border in at least two areas near the settlements of Al-Amal and Maroun al-Ras. At the same time, the Israelis are launching massive attacks on border and rear targets in Lebanon. Pro-Iranian proxies in Iraq and representatives of the Yemeni movement Ansarallah reported launching missiles and UAVs at air bases and industrial infrastructure in Israel, but none of the ammunition reached their target. At the same time, in the evening, the Israeli Air Force launched another strike on the center of Damascus.

Literally a week after the end of the Japanese-French training, a new activity was launched aimed at practicing airborne operations. According to an official announcement from the Japanese military, it plans to use US Air Force aircraft to improve the tactical skills needed to conduct airborne landings and increase the level of cooperation between the parties. The main goal of the training is to develop an effective response to various situations, including an attack on remote Japanese islands. This is the third time such exercises have been held this year; the last one took place in August. 📌 As can be seen, amid increasing tensions in the Asia-Pacific region, Japan continues to strengthen its defense capabilities through active cooperation with the US military. It is also important to note that the exercises demonstrate the Japanese desire to respond to potential threats from China. Indeed, in the event of a hypothetical outbreak of conflict in the Taiwan Strait, Japanese territories located near the island also risk coming under attack.

🇷🇺🖇 On Monday, a statement was published on the resources of t...	🇷🇺🖇 On Monday, on the resources of the Kommersant Publishing House, a statement was published by the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, Mikhail Lukin, regarding our article, where many uncomfortable questions were asked about the nature of Elena Chernenko’s contacts with British intelligence. In Lukin’s statement, it was stated in a boorish manner that bloggers , unable to compose a text longer than 15 lines, wrote a denunciation against his subordinate. At the same time, the authors, according to him, allegedly demonstrated ignorance of the basics of journalistic and operational work. 📌 Therefore, we consider it important to state the following: ▪️ Rybar’s team conducted its own investigation using open sources and information provided to journalists of federal Russian media by the Central Election Commission of the FSB of Russia. ▪️ Working with information, first published on September 13, was reflected in a series of articles involving several journalists, oppositionists and public figures. ▪️We believe that Russian counterintelligence understands perfectly well what journalistic activity is, and they would hardly demonstrate operational materials regarding ordinary correspondents performing their official duties. However, the public (including on the main television channels of the country) was shown footage of a meeting with a British intelligence officer of this particular woman.🔻In this regard, we would like to ask the editor-in-chief of Kommersant a few questions.➖Why is it not Elena Chernenko herself who answers, but Mikhail Lukin?➖ Are Kommersant 100% sure that Chernenko’s meetings with Christopher Joyce are part of journalistic duties (or maybe an editorial assignment?), or is there something the publication doesn’t know? Elena Chernenko was generally asked about the content of the meetings or in the newspaper in absentia decided to take the line of justification?➖What will the editors do if it suddenly turns out that the journalist handed over to the enemy information entrusted to her during meetings of our government structures, highlighted the people the enemy needed and helped to reach them? Will the ID still protect such a person after such information? Or is the high rank of a journalist and a reputable publication a universal cover in any situation?➖According to Lukin, Chernenko is a highly professional journalist, and in journalism they understand perfectly well what the work of an intelligence officer is. That is, based on logic, she should have perfectly understood who she was communicating with, where the information provided could go, and what consequences this could lead to for people. Taking into account this entire list of questions, we come to the main thing: why Elena Chernenko has not yet come out from the shadows and did not tell the public about the content of the meetings? Was it an interview she conducted with an Englishman (if that was it, where are the articles?), or did he interview her, carefully recording the information he provided? We are absolutely convinced that the results of the investigations into the British spy scandal are public information and sweeping it under the rug, guided by the notorious shop-floor solidarity, means devaluing the work done and playing along with Russia’s opponents. You can get acquainted with materials on this topic by following the links:➖About British spies in Russia and the intelligence activities of the British Foreign Office➖About the propaganda department of the British Foreign Office➖Evidence for the British Foreign Office➖How Russian NGOs lobbied for migration with money from the British Foreign Office➖What unites the journalist -Kommersant- and representatives of Mi-6?

Now in the Middle East, at air bases in Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Jordan, the Americans have about 60 aircraft stationed, including F-16, F-15, F-22A and even attack aircraft A-10. It is still unclear where and exactly how many aircraft will arrive this time. But to be surprised by this is a completely thankless task, given that the Pentagon uses any escalation to short-term strengthen its presence.

🔁🎬🖼 What kind of wooden crap is that NATO secretaries general ...	Forwarded From Topics. The main thing (GlavMedia) What kind of wooden crap is that NATO secretaries general pass on to each other - they ask on social networks. This is the so-called NATO hammer, a smaller copy of the Viking hammer. It was transferred to the alliance by Iceland in 1963 and is considered a visual reflection of the alliance’s right to judge, punish and the embodiment of indomitable power. This gavel is used at special meetings and special sessions of NATO - for example, according to former participants in such meetings, it was with it that the secretaries general of the Alliance knocked after -sentencing- Yugoslavia and Libya. In a letter leaked to Wikileaks, one of the Western diplomats reasoned - probably one day he will knock about (an attack on) Russia. Also, for some reason, the former head of NATO took this hammer to a meeting with... Russian journalists. Stoltenberg, who had recently left office, handed over this hammer - for special matters - to the new head of NATO - Rygge, who immediately used it. Iceland (the birthplace of the Althing - the great-grandfather of all parliaments) donated the same chairman's gavel to the UN in 1962. It differs only in the engraved phrase - The world must be built on the basis of laws - (we know this - a world based on rules -, thank you). The blow of the gavel announces the beginning of the meeting and its end, the approval of the agenda, the election of officials, the adoption of a resolution. And the UN gavel broke when the former chairman of the General Assembly broke it - trying to calm down Khrushchev, who had gone into a rage with his shoe, by knocking. In 2005, it turned out that the gavel of the UN chairman had disappeared - a copy of it is now in use, the original has not yet been found. During excursions around the UN, you can hear a story that at that time the UN was discussing the -Gypsy issue-, but there is no official confirmation of this. However, Russia has its own miracle hammer. More precisely - a fucking sized sledgehammer (not a fake!), which is always located in the central control center of the Strategic Missile Forces - to guarantee missile launches -.

Thus, in the United States, a ministerial meeting was held on the problem of the Islamic State, at which Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke. In his speech, he emphasized the importance of international cooperation in the fight against terrorism and noted the successful work of the coalition against the Islamic State, which has grown from 12 to 87 countries. At the end of the speech, the Secretary of State announced the allocation of $148 million for operations in Africa, as well as $168 million for reconstruction in Iraq and Syria. The event as a whole shows how Americans are working to achieve their interests. They themselves created the problem (IS), they themselves set out to solve it, and now they themselves are reviving it again. By the way, in his speech Blinken also mentioned the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, saying that this will bring peace to the region. Apparently, he forgot what an important role Hezbollah played in the destruction of ISIS in Syria in 2014-2017. And the words about the allocation of money, of course, may sound good in the media, but the amounts mentioned are simply meager in comparison with the destruction that they brought behind the USA and the extremist animals they created.#USA #terrorism@rybar Support usUnited States Department of StateSecretary Antony J.

But that was not the case. It seems that no matter how much we (and you too) hide from mentions of the ubiquitous company CaseGuru - yes, the one that produces wireless headphones CGPods from - Tyumen Elon Musk - - we cannot ignore this news we can. Tyumen residents recently released a new -Customer Service Policy-, which openly stated that dogs and foreign agents are not allowed to enter and refuse to work with a number of clients, including: Ilya Varlamov, Yuri Dud, Lyubov Sobol, Dmitry Muratov and other popular liberal liberals views. Haters who don’t like the brand also fall under this category. We are of course curious how exactly CaseGuru will monitor the political preferences of its clients and how the FAS will look at such measures. But the very fact of the appearance of such restrictions on the Russian electronics market looks like a precedent. It’s even more interesting whether this case will become the beginning of a flash mob for other companies that might want to hype in the same way.

At the same time, as we said earlier, we are not talking about one nuclear power plant, but about the development of the industry as a whole, since Kazakhstan will need two or three stations in different regions of the country in the future.▪️The campaign period passed quietly and calmly. Supporters of the construction of the nuclear power plant formed a people's headquarters and held events in different regions of the country. The number of supporters of the construction of a nuclear power plant has grown to 72.9%, the turnout should be more than 60% of voters.▪️However, this blissful picture is spoiled by one circumstance. All protest activity was concentrated on social networks and pro-Western Internet sites. Active campaigning against the construction of a Russian nuclear power plant was carried out by the NPP is not needed platform, created by five Kazakh eco-activists, financed by USAID and structures of the Soros Foundation. Colleagues from Sputnik explained the structure of the platform well in their video. ▪️It’s funny that the oppositionists criticized the voting procedure, during which citizens were not given the right to choose who will build the station. As if such issues were no longer within the competence of the relevant structures, and if it had been immediately stated that the station would be built by a French or American company with no relevant experience, and not a proven Russian one, then the environmental situation in the country would have immediately improved.🔻Although there are doubts about the success of the referendum no one has, a new line of attack from pro-Western platforms, along with behind-the-scenes pressure and lobbying for Western risky projects, will cause many more problems and will shake the socio-political life of Kazakhstan until the announcement of the contractor. #Kazakhstan #energy @rybarSupport usTelegramSputnik Near Abroad🇰🇿 For money - against!

Then there was no rapid advance by the IDF, and the media reported information about exchanges of fire in the border zone. However, today for the first time there was confirmation of Israeli units crossing the Lebanese border - they entered the settlements of Al-Adisa and Maroun al-Ras. The battles in these settlements were confirmed by Hezbollah representatives, although they focused on the significant losses of the Israelis. ▪️The day before, the 36th division of the Israel Defense Forces was deployed to the Lebanese-Israeli border, which includes the 1st Golani infantry brigade and the 188th armored brigade, previously involved in combat operations in the Gaza Strip. At the moment, forces of 98 and 36 divisions are operating near the border with Lebanon, while units of the 162 division are located in the border - Philadelphia corridor - in the south of the Palestinian enclave. Units of another reserve division (252) are located in the Netzarim corridor. ▪️Yesterday, the IDF press service called on civilians to evacuate from more than 20 settlements in Lebanon, located both near the border and on the Mediterranean coast. It is noteworthy that Marun al-Ras fell into the evacuation zone, but Al-Adisa did not. ▪️Throughout the night and morning, the Israelis attacked the border and rear settlements of Lebanon. More than ten hits hit the southern suburbs of Beirut, where two communication stations were destroyed.▪️In the afternoon, confirmation of the presence of members of the Egoz unit in the settlements of Maroun al-Ras and Al-Adisa appeared. Hezbollah fighters responded with ambushes, incursions and missile launches at nearby IDF targets. At the same time, the Israeli media published information about the outbreak of a shootout in southern Lebanon, which resulted in the death of two IDF fighters. The incident was commented differently in Arabic-language media, reporting a successful ambush, which allegedly wounded 35 Israelis. This information has not been officially confirmed; indirect evidence of this is the footage of eyewitnesses who filmed the evacuation of wounded military personnel by helicopter and the same statements by the IDF press service about the death of two IDF fighters during an operation in southern Lebanon. 🔻And although the incident with the successful ambush instilled in the Arabic-language media some confidence in the positive outcome of the conflict with the Israelis, such statements, to put it mildly, are very premature: one successful ambush is just a drop in the ocean. Moreover, against the backdrop of the absolute superiority of the Israelis in the air, numbers and the quality of weapons, as well as heavy losses of Hezbollah command personnel as a result of previous Israeli operations.

In Kharkov, since the beginning of the Northern Military District, they have been producing all kinds of components for UAVs and missiles, including electronics. Armored vehicles and aircraft are repaired in Nikolaev. Well, in occupied Zaporozhye they are producing aircraft engines with all their might.🔻That is, if the same factories in Kyiv or production exported to Transcarpathia can only be reached with cruise and aeroballistic missiles, then enterprises like Motor Sich or Kommunara are in the affected area not only OTRK, but also in some places even new aerial bombs with UMPC. But there has been no systematic fire attack on these objects since the beginning of the Northeast Military District. From time to time they became targets of the Russian Armed Forces, but the attacks were most often single and greatly extended in time, which allowed the enemy to repair the damage and continue working. Yes, it is not easy to destroy them, but a one-time large salvo of missiles at key workshops of a particular enterprise will solve this problem. The effect will not be long in coming: for example, in past years, one very good raid had previously significantly slowed down Ukrainian developments in the field of missile technology. However, for a combination of reasons, priority in systematic massive strikes is now apparently given to other objects in the territory controlled by the Kyiv regime.

Vance and Democrat Tim Walz, have ended. The meeting, which took place on CBS, was very different from similar events involving Trump, Biden and Harris: to everyone’s amazement, both speakers demonstrated a high level of political culture and competence on many pressing issues. ▪️J.D. Vance was very confident and cultured - he did not interrupt his opponent , skillfully parried his attacks, competently attacked and skillfully handled the facts. Years of work as a lawyer taught him to behave well and maintain composure while delivering a speech, so the politician never misspoke or hesitated. Importantly, Vance demonstrated a high level of awareness of current American economic indicators. In doing so, he made a significant contribution to winning over Trump's undecided voters who were concerned about their wallets. He also prevented the host from casting doubt on the migrant crisis in Springfield, Ohio, by citing statistics showing that illegal immigrants had become illegal overnight. make up 25% of the city's population. The answer turned out to be so inconvenient for the presenters sympathetic to the Democrats that the politician was turned off.▪️Tim Walz, against the backdrop of Kamala Harris’ speech, showed himself clearly better - he defended himself well, was well versed in the pressing problems for the United States, and treated his opponent with respect, without making mocking faces and without throwing disdainful glances. And yet, the politician often repeated memorized theses, resorted to populism and had difficulty adapting on the fly, which ultimately played a cruel joke on him. Thus, he confused Iran and Israel, blurted out that he had good relations with many school shooters. . Walz also noticeably swam when he was reminded of his own lie about being in China during the events in Tiananmen Square: he could not get out of it, giving an incoherent speech about his childhood in Nebraska.🔻As a result of the event, the entire American press recognized that the debate was outstanding - like in the good old 60s. Few people doubted Vance’s victory—even the pro-democracy CNN recognized his triumph, albeit with the caveat that it would not have a significant impact on the results of the presidential election. However, here CNN is clearly disingenuous—even though the debate discredited the previous confrontation between Trump and Harris, which was quite primitive and downright radiated mutual hatred and disdain, Vance brought the necessary composure, civility and the highest level of competence on all issues to the Trump campaign. #USA@rybar with @usaperiodicalSupport usCNNTakeaways from the vice presidential debate between Vance and Walz | CNN PoliticsThe vice presidential debate between Ohio Sen.

The Israelis confirmed their words with footage from operations in Aita al-Shaab, Kafr Kil and Mays al-Jabal. The footage shows how IDF fighters enter the underground structures of the Lebanese group, where they discover neatly stacked weapons and ammunition, as well as a fairly extensive network of tunnels. All this reinforces the general message of the statements of the Israeli command - Hezbollah planned to attack Israel like the invasion of Hamas militants on October 7, 2023, thereby implementing a certain plan for the occupation of the Galilee. So that the listeners are left with no questions, they are told what would await them if it were implemented - - the massacre of innocent men, women and children -. And everything would be fine, but an attentive viewer should have questions, the general essence of which will boil down to misunderstanding the absence in the video materials of clashes with the Lebanese group during the capture of such important objects. If they were empty, then why were they abandoned and why leave weapons and ammunition there in that case? Be that as it may, the Israelis are once again trying to play their favorite card with the status of a victim, this time only a potential one. This, among other things, justifies the current operation - Arrows of the North - as a result of which the number of dead and injured amounts to thousands of Lebanese. #Israel #Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64039	2024-10-02T02:21:01-07:00

As a result, the billionaire became the owner of the Audacy platform without the necessary national security checks that could have taken for more than a year.🔻Republicans' concerns are understandable: back in July, Soros and his son Alex, the current chairman of the Open Society Foundation (recognized as an undesirable organization in the Russian Federation), supported the nomination of US Vice President Kamala Harris as a candidate for the post of head of state in November elections. At the same time, Harris’ connections with Soros have been traced for a long time. It is known that while Harris served as California prosecutor (2011-2017), Soros financed a number of her legal initiatives, and later donated money to her election campaign for the US Senate (2017-2021). Since then, the politician has often given speeches at events organized by the billionaire. Entrepreneur Elon Musk, after the news appeared about the Soros family's support for Harris's candidacy, announced that she would become another puppet of the billionaire. In addition, Soros is a financial -megadonor- of the US Democratic Party and, according to open data, donated through organizations controlled by him to Democrats' electoral needs in 2024 are at least $15.6 million. However, it is obvious that the billionaire actually invested much more money, because even the purchase of Audacy is estimated at $400 million.#USA #Soros @pezdicide no chemicals - just factsTelegram FRESHNESS❗️It turns out that the US Federal Communications Commission has given the green light to George Soros' purchase of 220 more than radio stations ahead of the November presidential election. The deal is unprecedented - these stations reach 165 million Americans.	https://t.me/rybar/64038	2024-10-02T01:54:01-07:00
🖼 🇦🇫🇹🇯🏴 About possible sabotage on the border of Tajikistan...	🇦🇫🇹🇯🏴 About possible sabotage on the border of Tajikistan and Afghanistan Interesting news comes from Tajikistan: from September 24 to October 15, along the border section with the provinces of Badakhshan and Takhar in Afghanistan, a maximum danger regime has been introduced, which is why vacations have been canceled for personnel. The reason This was prompted by information received about the activity of militants - Jamaat Ansarullah - in the north of Takhar province. In mid-September, a group of extremists arrived in the Navabad area and have already carried out reconnaissance at the border posts of Ai-Khanum and Kaflotun. The militants, Jamaat Ansarullah, intend to conduct a similar assessment of vulnerabilities in the security system of border areas at the border crossing of Hamadoni in Khatlon province in the next few days. Against this background, the Tajik authorities have strengthened control over the border, established additional patrols, organized drone surveillance and limited foot traffic between the countries. A very non-trivial turn considering recent years, when the Taliban movement came to power in Afghanistan. From that moment on, such events practically stopped happening. But in this case we are talking about Jamaat Ansarullah, a group that has long been trying to destabilize the situation in Tajikistan, and its militants previously took refuge in Afghanistan before 2021. Although the leadership of the Taliban announced the destruction of terrorism, individual cells continue to function on the territory of the country, and given the difficult situation inside Afghanistan, there is no escape from them yet. In addition, it is worth remembering the currently popular trends about the danger of IS and other terrorist groups for the countries of Central Asia. -An unexpected attack by militants in the border area could serve as another reason for the United States and allies to lobby for their services in the region.

Forwarded From Sex, cartels, Frida Kahlo🇲🇽🇱🇹🚬Those who are interested in the state of affairs with smuggling in the American borderlands know very well that the precipitation differs from location to location: somewhere it is in the form of meatballs, somewhere it is cocaine, and in some places cigarettes are in particular demand. Colleagues wrote about how, for many years now, various types of flying objects have been penetrating Lithuanian territory and are being used by smugglers to deliver cigarettes to the desired address. Strictly speaking, cigarettes are very popular both in Lithuania and neighboring Latvia - at one time it was considered good manners to grab a block as a gift, since you were traveling from Russia or Belarus. Then this block could even reach Ireland - along with a large number of Baltic citizens working there. Strictly speaking, there is no sensation in the topic. If we talk about the methods of delivering contraband, they have been diverse since ancient times and are constantly evolving - otherwise this craft would have died out long ago. We also observed the air delivery of prohibited goods on the US-Mexico border - I don’t remember them being shot down there, there are simply patrolled points where the goods can be picked up from the ground faster than the customer. And the border there is bare, unlike Lithuania, surrounded by forests, where it is much easier to go to one of the residents of border villages who sell smoke with much less risk. As for the story about the scandal among Lithuanian officials on the topic of who will deal with the problem, two facts are overlooked: Some of the local officials are clearly involved in smuggling (including cigarettes), without the participation of border services, separate episodes they don't roll. 🔸In two weeks, elections to the Lithuanian Seimas are due to take place, against the backdrop of which the political situation in any country is worsening, shifting responsibility onto each other and other delights begin, designed to highlight the shortcomings of the characters, which theoretically could affect something. I don’t rule it out, that the scandal with the air delivery of cigarettes will be used just for the latter. #Mexico #Lithuania@sex_drugs_kahlo - Latin American happiness [no]TelegramV Z - VIEW.RULithuania suddenly suffered large-scale air raids from hundreds of illegal air targets.

Recently, a meeting was held in Tashkent between the Minister of Digital Technologies of Uzbekistan Sherzod Shermatov and a delegation of the American company RFA. The company is preparing to obtain resident status -IT Park Uzbekistan-, demonstrating interest in using the Zero Risk program, and in the future plans to open an IT center in the republic. 📌RFA has worked with more than 800 hedge funds, investment companies and asset managers. The range of services offered includes cloud solutions, IT service management, cybersecurity, data management, as well as application services and detection and response systems. ▪️Here it is necessary to clarify that the core of RFA is the Microsoft corporate operating environment, one of the blocks is Office 365. Cloud technologies are provided on the basis of Azure, and the system, of course, contains a security threat assessment block (Threat Intelligence). Collectively, the proposed solution is called Automated Incident Response Engine (-AiRE-). Therefore, we are talking about establishing control over financial transactions, electronic document management, monitoring systems, security, analysis and data processing. In fact, most of the IT sector in Uzbekistan will be tied to one service provider, which will simply be a block in the global Microsoft system. RFA is a financial all-inclusive from globalists.▪️Another interesting point: on the official resources of Uzbekistan, RFA is declared as American, but it is registered in London. Moreover, the entire management of the company indicates London offices as contact information.▪️The start of work in the Republic of RFA is a continuation of the systemic efforts of the West to take control of the strategic sectors of the economy of Uzbekistan, which we wrote about earlier. We are talking about preparing the IT infrastructure before listing Uzbek securities on the stock exchange. And the placement of securities of Uzbek companies will be handled by RFA, all financial transactions and access to funds will be controlled by RFA. Without this digital intermediary, most of the economy of Uzbekistan will simply be deprived of the opportunity to function and develop. Development will be possible only if all projects are agreed upon by RFA management. 🔻With a high probability, the decision was influenced by the promises of Western curators to create jobs, open access for goods from Uzbekistan to the markets of developed countries, attract investments, and even the opportunity to conduct an IPO of their own companies, withdraw money to anonymous accounts completely legally and safely. Only the curators left out a small detail - from the moment the system is fully deployed, it is they who will control most of the economy of Uzbekistan, tied to third-party information services. Uzbekistan, like many Central Asian countries, lacks IT potential sufficient to create independent platforms. Therefore, the country's leadership preferred a ready-made solution out of the box from RFA. Time will tell how soon this box will turn into a Pandora's box for the leadership and population of Uzbekistan. #Great Britain #USA #Central Asia #Uzbekistan @rybarSupport usNews from Central AsiaThe RFA company plans to open an IT center in Uzbekistan - News from Central AsiaMeeting of the Minister of Digital Technologies of Uzbekistan Sherzod Shermatov with a delegation of the American company RFA was held in Tashkent.

Forwarded From Andrey Medvedev Indeed, Iran’s statements that as a result of a strike on Israel, IDF military bases were hit, Israeli aircraft and infrastructure were destroyed, look, let’s say, controversial. I won't go deeper. Just here's one historical episode for you. So, 1818. The Persian Shah Abbas Mirza writes to the Russian ambassador in Tehran, General Ermolov (yes, the one who fought in the Caucasus) about his victories over the Afghans. The Persian-Afghan war was just going on. -Our victorious troops are always protected by the cavalry regiments of the heavenly forces, and therefore the actions of the enemy on the battlefield have the same power against us as the stars of heaven against the rising sun. Our flaming sword, aimed at defeating the enemy, is lightning, burning everything. From the dust carried by our invincible cavalry, the battlefield became so dark that if the fire opened by the sarbaz had not illuminated it, the arrows that took life would not have found a way to pierce the enemy’s hearts. The battle lasted for five hours, and the combatants could not distinguish between white and black. Finally, at sunset, from the fire of the cannons crushing the Caucasus Mountains, the foundation of the enemy troops was destroyed, and the unfortunate banner of the enemy was overthrown. Ermolov, of course, knew perfectly well how everything really was there. But it was completely the opposite. Ermolov reported the following to the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Count Nesselrode: -The Khorosans, together with the Afghans, defeated the Persian troops, and the damage was terrible. The commander of them bought his head with a large sum of money, and the Shah, although he continued to command the troops, but, having gathered large forces, himself went to the enemy. The inhabitants of Tehran believe, however, that he will not go far, fearing that the slightest failure under his own leadership will make a bad impression among the people. Despite the failure, however, false news of victories is announced and celebrations are celebrated. Now Iranian statements are somewhat reminiscent of a letter about a flaming sword. Although, in fairness, it is worth noting that even if some important targets were hit in Israel, no one will ever know about it. Israeli media, bloggers, LOMs, are extremely disciplined in this sense. https://t.me/vysokygovorit/17510Telegram Older than the Edda In assessing Iran’s evening strike on Israel, I probably trust Israeli data more.

And in the south of the enclave there were clashes again east of Al-Fokhari. In the West Bank, Israeli security forces carried out operations in at least ten localities in the region, detaining suspects with links to Hamas. Violent clashes took place in Nablus, where four IDF fighters were wounded. The situation on the Lebanese-Israeli border has further deteriorated as the Israelis announced the ground phase of the operation. Nevertheless, so far everything is limited to skirmishes along the border and strikes by the sides on each other’s targets. During the night, Iran launched about 200 ballistic missiles into Israel. Most of them were intercepted by air defense systems, the rest mostly fell in vacant lots.

❗️🇮🇱🇮🇷 Interim results of Iran's strike on Israel Two months ...	❗️🇮🇱🇮🇷 Interim results of Iran's attack on Israel Two months after the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and four days after the death of Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, the Iranians decided on the promised massive attack on Israel. ▪️According to recent estimates, about 200 ballistic missiles were fired into the country, but a significant number were intercepted by Israeli air defense systems. At the same time, American air defense systems were also involved in repelling the attack. ▪️Videos were distributed on the Internet that confirmed hits in individual areas, but at the moment the list of military targets hit is unknown. According to the footage, it is much more likely that the main place where the missiles will fall is wasteland. Although video footage of the aftermath of the strikes has already begun to appear in the media, Israeli censorship works well enough that only fallen debris or destruction of civilian objects leaks onto the Internet. ▪️Nevertheless, statements about the effectiveness of the raid are circulated in Arabic-language and Iranian media. Fars observers claim that at least 80% of the missiles reached their targets, and Shafaqna reported that at least 20 Israeli F-35s were destroyed. Another target was allegedly a cluster of tanks near the Netzarim intersection in the center of the Gaza Strip.▪️At least several rockets fell in the West Bank - one of them killed one and injured seven local Palestinians. Two more Israelis were wounded by shrapnel in Tel Aviv. There are also reports of victims who were injured on the way to bomb shelters. ▪️The Iranian attack could have been significantly more effective in the event of simultaneous launches also from Lebanon and the Gaza Strip, but this did not happen. ▪️All sorts of fakes have circulated on the Internet, including reverse footage of air defense missile launches, posing as arrival footage, and even the arrival of a Ukrainian UAV in Moscow City. ▪️It is noteworthy that literally before the Iranian attack in Tel Aviv, there was a terrorist attack in the Jaffa area: there, two men with machine guns shot people on a tram, after which they opened fire on passers-by. According to the latest information, eight people were killed, and the attackers were killed by Israeli security forces. Against the backdrop of the incident with the missile strike, speculation appeared on the Internet about the connection between both events - allegedly the terrorist attack could have been used as a distraction. However, such a version raises questions rather than trust. 🔻Despite the relatively small amount of information about the consequences of the attack, its overall results are clear and do not differ significantly from the April Iranian raid on Israeli territory. And the point here is that for Iran the main goal was not so much to inflict significant damage, but to create the desired picture for its audience, wounded by the latest actions of the Israelis. At the same time, we must pay tribute: the mostly outdated missiles launched by the Iranians are much cheaper than those spent by Israel and allied missile defense and missile defense systems. So, in economic terms, the attack was beneficial: another question is that this is unlikely to be enough in the current conditions.#Israel #Iran@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64024	2024-10-01T11:58:05-07:00

Azawad, with the support of radical Islamists from a group affiliated with Al-Qaeda - Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin - caused serious damage to the prestige of both the local armed forces and Russian military instructors.🔻With the goal of still conquering the last major stronghold of militants in northern Mali, government forces have recently stepped up operations in the region. ▪️After the accumulation of forces in the area of ​​the Kidal airport, a column consisting of fifty cars and armored personnel carriers moved towards Tin-Zautin. It is noteworthy that pro-government Tuareg militias also participate in it, who helped develop the route. ▪️At the moment, the convoy passed through the village of Tin Essako, where it stopped briefly due to the fact that militants were spotted at the point. After the latter escaped, the convoy continued moving, reaching the Amshaknshnar Valley.▪️This time, the leadership chose a more competent approach in planning the operation, spending most of the time outside the heights from where they could be detected or behind which militants could hide. In addition, the movement of the columns was preceded by active airstrikes against militants and reconnaissance sorties.❗️The unique case of using mock-ups in African operations also speaks to the quality of preparation. So, the militants, following the convoy, came across a model -Pantsir-S1-, which was considered real.🔻So far, all the observed action gives us hope that past mistakes in underestimating the enemy and overestimating their own capabilities were taken into account, and, given that before the ill-fated There are less than 100 km left of the city, in the coming days we will learn about the results of this operation.

The most significant advances are recorded both on the northern flanks and southeast of Kurakhovo. ▪️West of Novotoretsk, attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces pushed the enemy to the right bank of the Kazenny Torets River, and in the Grodovka area they broke through the defenses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, occupying two large strongholds. Now the path to Moscow and Mirnograd located behind it is open for the Russian army.▪️To the south, during the battles at the Nikolaevka-Sukhoi Yar line, units of the Russian Armed Forces advanced west of the Novogrodovskaya mine, gaining a foothold in the forest belt on the approaches to Lysovka. According to some reports, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have also lost control over the waste heap of the Novogrodovskaya No. 2 mine, but this information has not yet been confirmed by objective control personnel. ▪️West of Marinovka, an armored group of Russian troops attacked Ukrainian formations along the M-30 highway at the northern entrance to Selidovo. And on the southern outskirts of the city, paratroopers of the Russian Armed Forces landed near the city hospital, where they had not been able to gain a foothold before.▪️ At the same time, Russian troops started fighting on the southern outskirts of Tsukurino and in the area of ​​the St. Basil the Great mine. At the same time, the Russian Armed Forces are knocking out the enemy from the forest belts along the railway track, moving from the Selidovskaya mine and launching attacks from Ukrainsk. ▪️To the south, the Russian Armed Forces knocked out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from positions between Ostry and neighboring Maksimilyanovka, creating the preconditions for reaching the northern outskirts of the latter. At the same time, strikes continue to be launched against the few Ukrainian Armed Forces groups remaining in Ostroy, and unmanned aircraft are systematically destroying enemy equipment and infrastructure facilities in the Kurakhovo area.❗️The situation in the fields west of Nevelskoye has become somewhat clearer, from where no reports have been received for a long time, no frames. And the published statements of certain media about the occupation of this area by fighters of the Russian Armed Forces caused a certain skepticism, especially against the backdrop of the repeated liberation of the settlement in the Network. Nevertheless, in light of the incoming information about the advance of Russian troops in the lowlands near Zhelanny First and the eponymous Second, we can talk about the long-awaited occupation of the fields west of Nevelskoye, albeit with the assumption of a focal presence of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

Judging by reports from the field, the large At-Takala airbase and a rural airfield south of the city of Izra, as well as the positions of Syrian anti-aircraft gunners located in their vicinity, came under fire. Arabic-language media published information about the work of air defense in these areas, however, as a rule, this does not mean the interception of even the majority of the ammunition, especially taking into account, to put it mildly, the battered Syrian air defense and the constant decommissioning of the remaining systems. Apparently, a possible reason for the raid on aviation facilities could have been Iran's supply of ammunition for supported forces, which is not surprising in the context of the unfolding events in southern Lebanon.

Forwarded From Two Majors⚡️NATO continues to form new threats to the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian NavyFrom September 10 to 27, the alliance's annual maritime exercises REPMUS 24 took place in the territorial waters of Portugal. The exercises included testing of sea and air unmanned systems during anti-submarine, mine countermeasures and reconnaissance operations. The results of the maneuvers and the best weapons will be used in the NATO anti-submarine barrier concept, which involves the deployment of a network of autonomous vehicles to detect and track the activity of submarines. An interesting point was the active use of Portuguese TEKEVER AR3 and AR5 UAVs for reconnaissance, surveillance and reconnaissance on land as part of these exercises and at sea. For the first time, a new modification of the AR5 was tested, capable of installing sonar buoys, which made it possible to detect and track underwater targets. In addition, the capabilities of radar, cameras and communications have been improved, which has increased the reconnaissance characteristics of TEKEVER drones. Since 2023, this type of UAV has been actively used by the Ukrainian side for reconnaissance of the Black Sea and the Crimean coast. TEKEVER was repeatedly recorded during missile attacks in Crimea, escorting BEC, as well as attacks by Ukrainian DRGs on the peninsula. Now, the new capabilities of the drone will allow the enemy to deploy a network of sonar buoys in the Black Sea and organize tracking of the movement of submarines of the Black Sea Fleet, which are the only ones protected from Ukrainian attacks naval drones.✨While the bureaucratic war of the Black Sea Fleet with orders and instructions is still ongoing, the enemy is improving its weapons and the tactics of their use.

As the signing of the peace treaty approaches, one should wait for additional decisions of the Constitutional Court, which will actually allow changing the Constitution of Armenia without a referendum and without the adoption of amendments by parliament.▪️It is significant that the decision of the Constitutional Court was on the same days when Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan was in New York and held talks with Turkish President Recep Erdogan. On the same day as the decision of the Constitutional Court, a meeting of the foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan was also held with the mediation of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. 🔻The Americans, portraying the role of a mediator in the signing of the Armenian-Azerbaijani peace treaty, are persistently rushing Pashinyan with the constitutional changes that are required in Baku. When an obvious slippage began with the constitutional referendum, which would have delayed the conclusion of peace for another couple of years, the administration of the Armenian Prime Minister, through the mediation of the West, decided to take the path of least resistance, relying on amendments to the Constitutional Court. #Armenia #Azerbaijan #USA @rybarSupport usAnadolu AgencyThe Constitutional Court of Armenia approved the regulation on commissions for the demarcation of the Azerbaijani-Armenian border.

Recalling the previously concluded agreement on the strategic partnership between Kazakhstan and Great Britain, the United States also decided to designate its zones of influence in Kazakhstan.🔻Using this article as an example It’s clear to see how Kazakhstan is seen in the White House - as a gas station and as a transit station, through which dependence on Russia and China can be reduced. Therefore, the struggle for Kazakhstan is quite understandable, given the country's access to critical resources, such as uranium. #Kazakhstan #USA@rybar Support us The National InterestCalibrating U.S.-Kazakh CooperationU.S. policy toward Kazakhstan should focus primarily on nuclear nonproliferation, rare earth minerals, and enhanced trade routes.	https://t.me/rybar/64000	2024-10-01T07:03:58-07:00

Local residents reported several series of attacks across the city, which began at approximately 02:00. The SAR Ministry of Defense reported that most of the ammunition had been intercepted. The hits occurred in the western part of the Al-Mezze area, where foreign embassies are located and a military airfield is located. According to footage that appeared on the Internet, at least one of the targets of the attack was a certain car. However, it is currently unknown who was in it. Also killed during the raid was the famous Syrian TV presenter Safaa Ahmed, who lived in a building not far from the struck car. The Arab media have already announced that she died not from a rocket fragment, but from a targeted strike on her apartment (however, why spend a missile on a TV presenter is unclear). Syrian opposition sources also disseminated information about a series of hits on the positions of air defense crews, who tried to repel the attack. However, it is not possible to confirm these statements given the lack of personnel. 🔻So far, Israeli troops have been able to quite successfully combine ongoing operations in the Gaza Strip and southern Lebanon with sporadic strikes on Syria, gradually gaining political points and eliminating everyone who could pose a danger to the ultra-Orthodox government. It is noteworthy that the combination of massive strikes on the same Lebanon, with periodic raids on Syrian territory, allows it to strongly influence public sentiment and use this as leverage on Iran’s positions in both countries.

The operation itself has been going on for a week - previously everything was limited to air raids on Hezbollah targets in both border and rear settlements. However, the expected rapid advance of the Israeli troops did not follow; at the moment, only relatively familiar skirmishes are reported in the border zone, including near the small village of Rmeish, where maneuver groups of Israelis operated at night. At the same time, false information is being spread on the Internet about the entry of IDF units into a particular locality or about the complete withdrawal of Lebanese units beyond the Litani River. However, such reports are refuted by both Israeli and Arabic-language media. At the same time, judging by the increasingly frequent statements by the press service of the Israel Defense Forces about the need for all residents of southern Lebanon to urgently evacuate to the north of the country and remain there until the end of hostilities, the Israeli offensive may begin in the near future after observing the necessary politeness. Moreover, That approval for the ground operation has already been received from the United States - last night, American Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, after a conversation with his Israeli colleague Galant, expressed support for the IDF offensive in southern Lebanon.

Episodes of escapes of Ukrainian men from the TCC, often captured on video, are replete with either comical or tragic events. And sometimes both. The story of one such escape is in our new issue. Synopsis: Not everyone living in the so-called territory. Ukrainian male citizens are still ready to defend certain -ideals- with arms in hand. We can safely say: the number of such people has decreased significantly over more than two years of a special military operation. But the number of those who do not want to be on the line of combat contact has increased manifold. At the territorial recruitment centers (TRCs), there are no longer not only queues, but even small streams of volunteers ready to go to the front even tomorrow. At the same time, military commissars need to recruit people in any case and constantly replenish the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine - young and old, fit and not so fit, fighters. More and more videos are coming from the territory of Ukraine with harsh arrests, which are more reminiscent of robbery attacks. Videos where groups of Ukrainians are detained while trying to cross the border make an equally painful impression. However, this is better than being shot while trying to escape - and recently such stories have appeared...📌 You can download the comic using the links: RU | EN | AR | CN#Russia #Ukraine @rybarWe hope you liked the comic from our artists.

🔁🖼 How the West regulates migration from Central Asia to Russia...	Forwarded From Two MajorsHow the West regulates migration from Central Asia to Russia - article by uv. Comrade Fisherman✨Note that the difficult situation with illegal migration in Russia already in 2021 was reflected in the National Security Strategy of Russia in the form of a clause on Achieving the goals of ensuring state and public security by countering illegal migration, strengthening control over migration flows, social and cultural adaptation and integration of migrants. That is, the task was set by the Supreme Commander before the war. Moreover, already in 2023, the provisions of the Concept of the State Migration Policy of the Russian Federation for 2019 - 2025 were changed, as new challenges arose. At the same time, according to this doctrinal document, an economic justification is provided - in 2012-2017, the migration influx into the Russian Federation compensated for the natural population decline and became a source of additional labor resources for the national economy. The factor of valuable troubleshooting specialists is also stated that a significant proportion consists of low-skilled workers, whose demand is often determined by lower costs compared to the use of labor of citizens of the Russian Federation. Under these conditions, migration to Russia of the broad labor masses is objectively conditioned and inevitable. And this, as Rybar found out, was taken advantage of by the enemy. The American USAID, which was considered undesirable, could not be used. Therefore, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) acted as the main conductor of initiatives on the topic. Funding was provided by the World Bank, the UK Department for International Development and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC). Surprisingly for us, on the IOM website Rybar found as many as four completed programs in the field of labor migration to Russia, implemented from 2007 to 2021. ▪️ Project on Labor Migration in Central Asia (2007-2009) ▪️ Regional Program on Labor Migration in Central Asia and Russia (2010-2013) ▪️ Regional Program on Migration (2014-2015) ▪️ Facilitating Migration in the Central Asia Corridor — Russia- (2021) Details are in Rybar’s article.✨⭐️Probably, it’s really time to double-check all agreements with the UN and its structures involved in the field of migration to Russia. If only because the UN Headquarters is in New York, and the IOM is in Geneva, Switzerland, whose inflatable neutrality is a thing of the past. It is unlikely that Western structures will sincerely help Russia in solving its problems. But to cheat, get money and cause damage to Russia is always welcome.

According to the official, if the republic joins the EU, Europeans will be able to buy Moldovan lands. ▪️Mazheiks assures that for Moldova the massive sale of agricultural land to foreigners will be a plus, since many villages in the republic are dying out. ▪️Mijaix’s statement caused a stir, so Moldovan President Maia Sandu and Prime Minister Dorin Recean had to call the discussion of the EU ambassador’s statements disinformation.▪️At the same time, Prime Minister Recean promised that separate negotiations would be held in Chisinau with the EU to put a limit on the sale of Moldovan lands . True, it is not clear why any exceptions should suddenly be made for Moldovans in Brussels.▪️In addition, ex-Prime Minister Vlad Filat published examples from EU legislation, according to which a country cannot have a ban on the sale of land to foreigners upon joining the union.▪️ Opposition politician Renoto Usatii proposed enshrining in the Constitution a ban on the sale of Moldovan lands to foreigners. Moreover, agriculture is a strategic and key sector of the economy for Moldova. Usatii also noted that the citizens of Moldova are not even explained the meaning of joining the EU and the main points of negotiations are not disclosed. By the way, the other day in Moldova they blocked a website where they were trying to analyze the consequences of European integration for the republic. The revelations of EU Ambassador Mazeix clearly spoiled the election campaign of Sandu, who, with the help of a referendum on European integration, will try to enshrine the norm on joining the EU in the Constitution. However, the gross manipulations of Sandu and the Central Election Commission of Moldova, controlled by the West, are aimed at ensuring the desired results in the presidential elections and referendum on October 20. Moreover, the authorities in Chisinau have been openly ignoring the demands of Moldovan farmers for the last few years, who are massively going bankrupt amid the uncontrolled transit of Ukrainian grain, crisis and drought. As we have noted many times, Moldova has fallen into the trend of destroying national agriculture for the sake of such global corporations as Blackrock, which are also buying up the lands of the so-called.

South-east of the village, another Leopard 2A6 of the Ukrainian formations was hit. In other matters, it could be the same tank that took part in the attack on the village a week earlier. Footage of Ukrainian Armed Forces’ strikes on Krasnooktyabrsky appeared on the Internet, which confirms the presence of the Russian Armed Forces in the village and confident control over it. During the day, statements were also recorded about the withdrawal of enemy forces from Medvezhye under the onslaught of Russian troops, but this has not yet been confirmed by footage from the field.🔻In the Korenevsky district, Ukrainian formations are attacking in the vicinity of Kremyany, where they had previously gained a foothold in the forest belts to the east. Russian Aerospace Forces are processing the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces with FABs with UMPC; no attempts have been recorded to knock out the enemy on the ground.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, a Russian armored group attacked the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces south of the Plekhovo-Borki line. Several large forest belts and part of the border from Kucherovo to the Brodina gully came under the control of Russian troops. At the same time, the scale of the advance is not completely clear, since the footage of objective control was published by the enemy, who does not benefit from highlighting the successes of the Russian Armed Forces. Therefore, in reality, the scale of promotions can be much greater.

Various sources report tank shelling in the Wazzani area. This is a common thing: in the area of ​​Shebaa farms, tank shelling occurs regularly. In fact, the advance began in a very limited area. Israeli armored vehicle activity in the border area still remains high, and the surroundings of Metulla, Mitzgav Ama and Kfar Giladi have been declared a closed military zone. However, due to Hezbollah’s shelling, there weren’t too many local people here anyway. ▪️Lebanese media, meanwhile, are reporting shelling, including the use of incendiary ammunition, as well as high activity by Israeli aircraft and UAVs. ▪️Multiple reports of an invasion along the entire length of the state border so far turn out to be part of a large-scale disinformation campaign.▪️Another narrative: this is the alleged abandonment of positions by the Lebanese army and UN peacekeepers on the border and withdrawal five kilometers into the interior of the country. However, Lebanese resources have so far denied the army’s withdrawal, and the UN has not confirmed the information either.❗️According to our data, units of the Israel Defense Forces have occupied UN observation posts on their side of the border and are continuing preparations to advance deeper into Lebanese territory. One of these areas is the village of Rmeish, where the crossing of the state border has already begun. The situation with the village of Rmeish is generally interesting: even at the very beginning of the aggravation, local residents organized patrols to prevent Hezbollah missile launches from the vicinity of their native village and not to be subjected to return fire. But the Israeli army still decided to start with the unfortunate Rmeish.❓ Middle Eastern correspondents and observers agree that Hezbollah units will allow Israeli troops to enter Lebanese territory in order to lure them into a trap and begin to destroy them on their land, turning to guerrilla actions . 📍From the point of view of the use of Hezbollah units, which are not trained combined arms formations, such tactics would be logical if not for the nuance with the complete destruction of mid-level commanders: there is simply no one to coordinate the adequate conduct of guerrilla warfare in the group. The current tactics for training Hezbollah units looks like a minimum tactical unit (group) should be able to fight in complete encirclement and isolation on its outpost without communications and supplies. But the difference in potentials, as well as the fire and reconnaissance superiority of the IDF, which can throw an air bomb at each cell, has not been canceled.

Russian troops continue to advance in several sections of the Yuzhnodonetsk direction.▪️In Ugledar, several high-rise buildings on the western outskirts came under the control of the Russian Armed Forces , footage of Russian flags above multi-storey buildings No. 9 and 10 on Molodezhnaya Street appeared on the Internet. In the south of the city, a dormitory and medical building came under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. Thus, only the central part of the city remains under enemy control, the remaining roads to which are under fire control. At the same time, fighting continues on the eastern outskirts of the city; according to our data, small groups of the enemy are trying to retreat by landing to the north, however, in general, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have so far been able to hold the defense.▪️At the Konstantinovka-Vodyanoye line, Russian troops also advanced in several areas, taking a strong point south of Katerynivka and forest belts to the south and north of the Solenenkaya gully. Attacks by the Russian Armed Forces were also recorded north of Konstantinovka. ▪️West of Prechistovka, Russian troops had advanced significantly towards Zolotaya Niva by September 29, advancing from the south and east.

🔁🖼 Today is the second anniversary of the reunification of Donb...	Forwarded From Andrey Medvedev Today is the second anniversary of the reunification of Donbass, and indeed the entire Novorossiya, with Russia. And I want to remind you all a little of what happened before that. Vladik Dmitriev was killed on April 2, 2021. A Ukrainian copter operator dropped a grenade on a four-year-old boy. The boy was born during the war in Donbass, died in the war, and did not know a peaceful life. -Multiple injuries with traumatic amputation of the upper and lower extremities-. This is from the conclusion of a forensic expert. And then a portal to the underworld opened in our former liberal media. Cover of the morning broadcast on Ekho Moskvy the next day. Find it. Satisfied faces. Plyushchev and Felgenhauer. Topic of the program: -Killed boy- in Donbass-. Ekho Moskvy, following the Ukrainian media, called the information about the murder of a child fake, hence the quotation marks. They discussed on air whether this could have happened or not. Tanya Felgenhauer: There was some kind of incredible wave on the federal channels. Everything is escalating: war, war, war. A classic plot with a murdered child appeared. ALLEGEDLY. Already because of which Mr. Volodin began to speak. And the Investigative Committee began to initiate something. Now this conflict is more in the realm of propaganda? Or is this a real military threat? - When the bastard Plyushchev climbed into the YouTube trends with a vile video - Donetsk boy -, Alexey Venediktov joyfully commented on this event on his channel: - a trifle, but nice -. Even the OSCE mission eventually confirmed the death of Vladik Dmitriev from explosive injuries. But, you know, what is significant in this story is not how the liberal cannibals behaved. What’s more telling is that we endured all of this. They tolerated mockery of the murder of a child. All these people walked quietly among us, they were invited to all sorts of events, even quite official ones. And the work of this portal to the world of Lovecraft’s monsters of the independent media was paid for from the money of the state company. Do you understand the degree of our general degradation at that time? The sin of betraying our brother, in which we lived, do you understand? Imagine that now somewhere in the media in Russia they are mocking those who died in the Kursk region. Isn't it possible? And three years ago it was quite comme il faut. Remembering all this is much more important than celebrating and hiding your previous mistakes behind the current celebration.	https://t.me/rybar/63972	2024-09-30T11:02:03-07:00

🔁🖼 Military leaders of the Northern Military District. 20 names...	Forwarded From Children of ArbatMilitary Leaders of the Northern Military District. 20 names for 2024. Colonel General Lapin A shocking military leader who again became the object of everyone’s attention this summer, turning his actions into statements, and doubts about himself into a source of surprise. It was not for nothing that Lapin reshuffled positions and returned to the post of commander: On the path to realizing his personal ambitions, he always went ahead, which ultimately led to a series of mistakes. In May of this year, the military-political leadership sets before him the task of creating a sanitary area in the Kharkov direction, without allocating additional forces and means for the group, but with the subordination of the African Corps. The commander is faced with a difficult choice: to attack with what is at his disposal or to use the resource of cover groups that have a certain amount of weapons and military equipment. By the beginning of the invasion of the Kursk region, most of the equipment, including the reserves of 44 AK, went to Volchansk and Liptsy, which, of course, could not go unnoticed by the enemy. During this time, the Russian Army managed to take control of about 260 square kilometers, which, however, is far from the lines occupied in May 2022. With the start of fighting in the Kursk region, the commander is actually forced to be torn between two operational directions. Many seriously believe that Alexander Lapin will no longer overcome this blow of fate: problems fall not only on him, but also on his son, against whom a prosecutor’s investigation was initiated. Should a commander be judged for his character? If the troops were commanded by spineless commanders, then we would have already lost this war, but it is worth noting that once again Alexander Pavlovich attaches too much importance to criticism on the Internet. Colonel General Nikiforov-Chief cannot be better, it can only be worse—that’s what Yevgeny Nikiforov liked to say about personnel changes in the Armed Forces, but could the former commander have thought that he himself would soon rise to become a big boss. With the start of the offensive The Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk region, to restore order, the Chief of the Main Staff of the Ground Forces, Colonel General Nikiforov, was sent there, who, having arrived at the place, immediately got involved in the work and began setting tasks for his former subordinates, including the Deputy Commander of the Leningrad Military District, Esedulla Abachev, who was responsible for coordination of actions in the Kursk direction. It is worth noting that before Nikiforov, Colonel General Lapin, who regulated the work of cover groups during inspections, dealt with exactly the same issues in the border area. However, now this approach and setting tasks for former subordinates on the part of Yevgeny Nikiforov actually led to the establishment of dual power, to combat which a coordination council for border security was subsequently created, where Yunus-Bek Evkurov began to play the main role. Today, both military leaders are in a difficult relationship, largely due to differences in temperament: Nikiforov considers himself a superior commander and does not take into account any emotional attachment, remaining a pragmatist and considering everyone equally obliged to him, while Lapin believes that the commander of the group is it is an independent person who builds a homogeneous but closed organism that does not tolerate outside interference. The Minister of Defense reacted to the situation quite philosophically: without getting involved in the work of the General Staff, he entrusted the work of the cover groups to himself, thus gaining the opportunity to completely control the situation, reserving the right to personnel and organizational conclusions.

Last year the amount was about 1.4 billion.📌 The increase in spending on the armed forces was expected, given the state of the Armenian army now. At the same time, this measure will not help the Armenians much, if you remember what tactics the leadership adheres to: ➖Purchase of assorted equipment and weapons around the world, and, in some cases, decommissioned. ➖Dismissal of experienced personnel and promotion of convenient commanders.🔻But the reaction of Azerbaijan was not long in coming. As we thought, Baku is using this fact to accuse the Armenian leadership of militarization, since the Azerbaijanis have reduced defense spending for the next year. However, the Armenian neighbors do not mention one important point: their budget is 2 times larger than the Armenian one, even taking into account the slight reduction. #Azerbaijan #Armenia@rybar Support usARMENPRESS Armenian News AgencyIn 2025, it is planned to spend more than 3 trillion drams.

The Azerbaijani company Azersilah signed a memorandum of strategic understanding with the Israeli AS Holdings and its subsidiary Ari Arms. Ari Arms is known for producing small arms light weapons according to NATO standards. So cooperation between the state-owned Azerbaijani company will develop in this area. For the Muslim world, in light of recent events in the Middle East, this was shocking news. On social network X, many are demanding a boycott of Azerbaijan for cooperation with Israel.🔻However, well-informed observers in the region know that in Azerbaijan there is a strong influence of Mountain Jews, who are close in spirit to the current ultra-Orthodox government of Israel. Therefore, such agreements are not new for the two countries. On the eve of the Second Karabakh War, as well as before the operation of the Azerbaijani Armed Forces in Artsakh, the Israeli leadership actively supplied the Azerbaijanis with the necessary weapons and ammunition. Well, using this example, one can evaluate the real support for Palestine, the Gaza Strip and other Muslim countries from the Turkic tandem. Erdogan's populist threats mean nothing, one only has to evaluate the level of trade interaction with Israel.#Azerbaijan #Israel@rybar Support us	https://t.me/rybar/63964	2024-09-30T04:44:58-07:00

However, for now this is only a project, and it is unknown in what form it will be adopted, or whether it will be adopted at all. To implement all these points, a lot of effort is required, as well as the solution of other important nuances. One of these can be called powerful lobbying of the interests of ethnic communities at a high political level in Russia. And this is without mentioning the problem of corruption in the security forces. Of course, some changes have already appeared, foreigners who break the law are expelled from the country, banned from entering, but all this happens in a local format, and not nationwide. #multinationalism #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63963	2024-09-30T04:16:45-07:00

🇰🇿💰 Are the pension savings of Kazakhstanis floating overseas?...	🇰🇿💰 Are the pension savings of Kazakhstanis floating overseas? It became known that in August of this year, the National Bank of Kazakhstan invested 433 billion tenge from the Unified Accumulative Pension Fund (UPF) into government securities of the US government. It is significant that at the same time there are publications in the press that investments in Russian securities, already cheap, turned out to be unprofitable. In 2022, the National Bank invested the pension funds of Kazakhstanis in Eurobonds of the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, denominated in dollars, for 18.8 billion tenge, and since then the cost of these securities has decreased by 385 million tenge.📌 All this is done under the pretext of investing in -income instruments- in order to preserve and increase in this way. The Kazakh authorities generally like to use the pension savings of Kazakhstanis - they have already bought shares in Air Astana (the airline is not a national carrier and is generally under British control). Also, funds from the UAPF were used to purchase cars - freight and passenger - for the Kazakhstan Railways, a state monopoly. Moreover, this was not done directly, but also through the purchase of securities, the essence was that the UAPF acquired bonds of the national holding on market conditions - Baiterek - for $382 million, after which this amount is used to purchase 3,300 cars. In the report, there was confusion in the testimony: it turned out that there was $24 million more money than the UAPF invested in Baiterek, and 200 fewer cars were purchased. In general, trends show that the West continues to develop Central Asian capital. Thus, recently the President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev proposed to provide foreign companies with access to the pension assets of citizens of the republic. At the moment, these savings amount to about 20 trillion tenge, or in terms of the current exchange rate - 41.6 billion dollars. With such actions, Astana contributes to the fact that Americans do not have to turn on the printing press once again and increase inflation at home. And once again they support the American financial pyramid, politely called -national debt-.#Kazakhstan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usinformburo.kzThe National Bank invested the pension money of Kazakhstanis in August only in US government securities. There were no investments in other financial instruments.	https://t.me/rybar/63960	2024-09-30T02:59:58-07:00

Prior to this, IDF Air Force planes attacked the southern suburb of the Lebanese capital, where Hezbollah facilities are predominantly located.▪️In the Kola area, an airstrike hit the office of members of the Lebanese Sunni group Al-Jamaa al-Islamiya on one of the upper floors of the building. In the room at that moment there were two members of the leadership of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), Muhammad Abdel Al and Imad Odeh, as well as one of the front activists, Abdul Rahman Abdel Al, all of them died. Al-Jamaah al-Islamiya (the Lebanese branch of the international association -Muslim Brotherhood-) and the PFLP work closely with Hezbollah, carrying out joint armed attacks against Israel.▪️As ​​a result of another morning strike on a Palestinian refugee camp in Tire, the commander was killed Hamas headquarters in Lebanon Fatah Sharif Abu Amin. He was also the chairman of the UNRWA teachers' association. Israel sets one of its main military goals to eliminate the leadership of Hezbollah and Hamas, and the key in this sequence was the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah as a result of the bombing of a bunker in the suburbs of Beirut.#Israel #Lebanon # USA@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63959	2024-09-30T02:16:37-07:00

At the meeting, he noted the prospects for economic development, including the opening of a Russian bank in an African country. Military cooperation between the parties was also noted.▪️In addition, speaking at the plenary session of the Russian Energy Week, Nguema Mbasogo expressed interest in cooperation in the energy sector. As a member of OPEC, Equatorial Guinea has some resource base for relevant initiatives. Under pressure from the West, Nguema Mbasogo is trying to enlist support from China and Russian partners. After the failure of the Chinese project of a logistics point on the Atlantic coast, this niche remains unoccupied. Also in the country, presumably, there are some deposits of coltan, for the possession of which an invisible war broke out between the United States and China. In such a situation, the expansion of Russian influence in Equatorial Guinea could make adjustments to the current situation in central Africa. Gaining control over the key to the Atlantic and coltan could undermine the West's position in the region.#Africa #Russia #EquatorialGuinea@rybarSupport usTelegram SOLOVIOV🖥️ A meeting between Vladimir Putin and the President of Equatorial Guinea Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo began in the Kremlin.✍ Subscribe to Solovyov!	https://t.me/rybar/63958	2024-09-30T01:43:58-07:00

Now the Russian Armed Forces are breaking through to the northwest in the direction of Heroes of Labor Street along several parallel streets from Kemerovo to Pushkarenka. To the south, Russian troops are gradually expanding the zone of control west of Correctional Colony No. 2, several streets in the private sector have already been cleared of the enemy. At the same time, it is still not possible to occupy the waste heap to the south due to the high activity of Ukrainian UAVs. 🔻In the Zabalka area, the Russian Armed Forces apparently slowed down somewhat due to the continued presence of the enemy in the forests to the east and frequent counterattacks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine from Shcherbinovka. Messages and other evidence of progress have not appeared for quite some time. 🔻At the Leonidovka-Novgorodskoye (New York) turn, several forest belts west of the Krivoi Torets River came under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. The enemy here relies on heights 184 and 164 in the forest belts and on a chain of strong points. If it is possible to develop an offensive in this sector, Russian troops will be able to increase pressure on Leonidovka, which will improve the situation in Dzerzhinsk for the Russian Armed Forces. West of Novgorod, meanwhile, the advance of the Russian Armed Forces in the direction of Sukhaya Balka, where a stronghold of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was taken, as well as Panteleimonovka, where the enemy was driven out of several wide forest belts, is also recorded.

After the Crimean spring, at the height of the war in Donbass, another confrontation appeared: we began to fight terrorism at distant approaches. Over these nine years, the operation has changed: active combat operations are no longer carried out, there is periodic bombing and destruction of enemy targets in the provinces of Idlib and Aleppo Yes, patrolling certain areas. I would, of course, like to see more active actions, but in the conditions of the Northern Military District, this is probably an unacceptable waste. During active operations, significant areas of territory were liberated and the basis for further settlement was laid. Perhaps, in the context of the Lebanese-Israeli war, the role of the Russian Armed Forces will grow even stronger: but to what extent and in what capacity, whether the conflict will spread to Syria, whether there will be a need to increase the contingent again - we will find out over time.

The main goal of the exercise is to improve interaction and increase the combat capability of the operational units of the armies of Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan.📌 Compatibility of combat units in any military alliance is one of the key areas for preparation, as evidenced by regular exercises of the United States and allies. If you read the main objectives of almost every NATO or US partner event in the Asia-Pacific region, then everywhere there will be a phrase - increasing the level of interaction -.🔻And here we are We observe a similar situation, however, between members of the political bloc - the Organization of Turkic States. The number of such exercises between members of the UTG has increased. They train, hone their application as part of interethnic groups (with nuances of the Central Asian mentality, but still) - they do everything that the Turks and their curators have been striving for for so long. And it seems that the exercise is small and not entirely significant, but, adding up all the events that were carried out over two or three months, the trend can be seen more and more clearly. #Azerbaijan #Uzbekistan@rybar Support us	https://t.me/rybar/63955	2024-09-30T00:31:06-07:00

According to the IDF press service, Hezbollah headquarters were among the targets attacked during the day. ▪️At the same time, the IDF command does not pay attention to the accompanying casualties among the civilian population. In just one day, in the eastern suburbs of Sidon, more than a hundred people were injured as a result of an airstrike on a multi-storey building, a third of them died. The total number of victims in Lebanon since the escalation has already exceeded one and a half thousand people, including foreigners. ▪️Despite statements by representatives of the Lebanese organization about launching missiles at various IDF targets, most of the ammunition is destroyed in the air by air defense systems, some of them even fall on Lebanese territory. Multiple air defense alarms in the Haifa area in the evening, according to local resources, were associated with the passage of just one air target.▪️Meanwhile, one of the shells fired by Hezbollah fell east of Jerusalem, causing several large fires and a power outage in populated areas in Western bank of the Jordan River. Lebanese rockets, although they reach the territories of the Palestinian Authority, often fall within populated areas, including in the area of ​​Arab villages. ▪️At the moment, American authorities are calling on the Israelis to abandon the idea of ​​​​conducting a ground operation in Lebanon, fearing tougher actions by Hezbollah and active intervention by Iran, which will inevitably lead to escalation. In addition, the United States assumes that if the conflict escalates, American facilities in the region will come under direct attack.▪️ The Islamic Republic of Iran is in a rather vulnerable position in front of a rival with a stronger position. The outcome of the confrontation will depend on the ability of Tehran and its allies to create new threats to the enemy.

If we talk about the reaction of countries and political movements of the Middle East to the death of Hassan Nasrallah, then for the most part it comes down to verbal condemnation of Israel, differing only in form. At the same time, almost everywhere the matter has not yet gone beyond statements.▪️Iranian spiritual leader Ali Khamenei introduced a five-day mourning period in the country. Other government officials spoke matter-of-factly about the imminent revenge while condemning the killing of IRGC deputy commander Abbas Nilforoushan, who died alongside Nasrallah.▪️Iraq's prime minister and Shiite religious leaders spoke out against Israel, and Islamic Resistance factions threatened to fire at him and his allies . So far, only the Yemeni Houthis have moved from words to action, launching missiles at Tel Aviv and shelling ships in the Red Sea.▪️In Syria, the authorities declared three days of public mourning, recalling in a statement the role of Hezbollah in liberating the country from militants. In areas of the provinces of Idlib and Aleppo controlled by opposition groups, on the contrary, the death of Nasrallah was celebrated.▪️Some of the Sunni countries in the region reacted curiously to the attacks on Beirut - they condemned Israel, but without much condolences because of the death of Nasrallah. This was caused by a long-standing ideological confrontation with Shiite Iran and Hezbollah.▪️Inside Lebanon itself, both allied and opposition Hezbollah, Sunni and Christian parties came out in its support, considering the murder of Nasrallah as an attack on the country. And several movements radically opposed to the group chose to remain silent. In general, Israel can hardly expect any powerful military response to what happened - Hezbollah itself is suffering very heavy losses, and Hamas’s statement about creating a united front with it the matter will not have much impact.❗️Iran found itself in a situation where it laid all its cards on the table and was left without trump cards in front of an opponent with a stronger deck. The further course of the confrontation will determine the extent to which the Islamic Republic and the forces it supports will be able to reorganize and create threats to their opponents from an unexpected direction&amp;High-resolution infographicsEnglish version#Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63941	2024-09-29T10:54:06-07:00
🇮🇱🇱🇧🇺🇸 In the situation with the death of the Hezbollah Sec...	🇮🇱🇱🇧🇺🇸 In the situation with the death of Hezbollah’s secretary general as a result of a strike on Beirut, the US reaction looks quite interesting: publicly, representatives of the American administration approved the death of Hassan Nasrallah, but behind the scenes they expressed dissatisfaction with the actions and plans of Israel. Thus, The Washington Post writes that officials in Washington are urging the Israelis not to carry out a planned ground invasion of the south Lebanon. The reason is fears of Iranian retaliation and the start of a larger regional war. It is unlikely that the United States here is afraid of the prospects of major Iranian attacks on Israel - as practice has shown, the IDF, with the help of its allies, is capable of repelling missile and drone attacks. Another thing is that the expansion of the war in the Middle East risks hitting the Americans themselves. In this case of conflict, any US facilities in the region will come under direct attack. And if now some kind of guarantee against this is the current level of escalation, when the United States and Iran tacitly limit each other in the choice of targets, then otherwise the pro-Iranian forces may simply -break the thread-. For example, Hezbollah fighters - in the face of problems with management on their own initiative will want to blow up the American embassy in Beirut, factions of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq will begin to pour fire on the airfields of the International Coalition, and Houthis - shoot at the oil fields of the Persian Gulf countries.❗️In each case, the United States will be forced to make a large-scale response, which contradicts its own plans to reduce its military presence in the Middle East. And the Democratic Party needs such a war even less on the eve of the presidential elections, especially against the backdrop of the shaky position of Kamala Harris.

This is manifested at least in the field of taxation. In particular, one of the local deputies stated that if the military tax increases from 1.5% to 5%, teachers’ salaries will simultaneously have to be reduced by 3.5%. It is characteristic that the salaries of the Verkhovna Rada employees themselves are planned to be increased by a quarter. As we have repeatedly mentioned, the collective West is curtailing support for the so-called. Ukraine is not yet planning and discussing the allocation of new large tranches. But they go mainly for military assistance and minimal basic needs, sufficient to continue the war until the last Ukrainian. The entire social sphere for the sponsors of the Kyiv regime is an extra expense, so they seek to shift these costs to the so-called Ukraine. And the authorities of this quasi-state entity will be able to do this only by squeezing the maximum out of what is still left in the territories under their control.#Ukraine@rybarSupport uswww.mk.ruThe salaries of Ukrainian teachers will decrease after increasing the military levyPeople's Deputy Southerner: Ukrainian teachers will receive less after increasing the military levy .	https://t.me/rybar/63939	2024-09-29T09:05:38-07:00

Remember the scandal with the local branch of VGIK: training was conducted not in Russian, but in Uzbek, there were no big names. Well, the public outcry helped. A commission came from Moscow from VGIK itself to check, and the Russian actor Sergei came to the branch in Tashkent Bezrukov. Sergei Bezrukov visited the university, talked with students and performed the play -Uncle Vanya- at the local palace of arts -Turkeston-. Photos from the event can be seen on the actor’s personal page. Moreover, the current unsightly events may be part of the confusion due to the change in leadership. The ex-director of the branch, Eldar Yuldashev, lost his position back in July. Now the director of the branch is Ikbol Melikuziev, who may not have had enough time to restore order. Now the new director of the branch is trying to correct the mistakes of the previous management, and the students, judging by the latest reviews, are happy with everything, and there were no more complaints from them. Of course, there are still plenty of problems, but it is gratifying that, against the backdrop of all the scandals, a review of the work of the branch is beginning. We didn’t have time to write about the problem, but they quickly rushed to solve it. This means that not everything is lost, the public outcry allows the situation to be corrected for the better, and the efforts of officials can be reversed.#Russia #Uzbekistan@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63935	2024-09-29T07:22:01-07:00
🇬🇧💉UK one step closer to assisted suicide Last week -...	🇬🇧💉UK one step closer to assisted suicide Last week, a citizen jury of the Nuffield Council of Bioethics (NCOB) concluded that assisted suicide should be legal in the UK. The jury concluded that a person suffering from a terminal illness should be able to legally access medication-assisted suicide. The council's conclusion is advisory in nature, but can subsequently be used as a decisive argument when amending laws. The UK is just following a trend that is sweeping the Western world. Assisted suicide is already practiced in Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, as well as certain states of the USA and Australia. Based on the experience of other countries, we can expect that if suicide is legalized in the UK, the following events will occur:▪️the number of drug-induced suicides will increase every year, perhaps even exponentially (as in Canada);▪️the list of people who will be able to commit suicide, will gradually expand, and over time will include people whose diseases are not fatal or incurable (including those of a psychological nature), and minors; ▪️a market for services will begin to form around assisted suicide: from service personnel and medications to devices that facilitate the procedure. 🔻Assisted suicide fits perfectly into the globalist agenda. It is easier for the state to let a chronically ill (but unable to pay for expensive medicine) citizen die than to provide him financially; get rid of a veteran suffering from PTSD rather than rehabilitate him in society; eliminate the result of a failed gender experiment rather than admit a mistake. ❗️Canadian experts already shamelessly estimate how much money assisted suicide helps save in the healthcare budget, and Swiss entrepreneurs are presenting capsules for independently carrying out medical suicide. The most difficult stage for beneficiaries of assisted suicide is its legalization in the minimum possible form. And subsequently, the boundaries of what is permitted can gradually expand. It seems that for the UK the decision has already been made, and all that remains is to prepare society morally for the coming changes.#Great Britain #globalism@rybar Support usSky NewsAssisted dying should be allowed in England, according to 'citizens' jury'The top two reasons the panel were concerned about a law change were that it could be used for the wrong reasons if safeguarding is not in place, and that it could be misinterpreted or misused.	https://t.me/rybar/63934	2024-09-29T06:34:13-07:00
🖼 🇱🇧 About possible successors to the leader of Hezbollah Afte...	🇱🇧 About possible successors to the leader of Hezbollah. After the death of Hassan Nasrallah, the question arose of who would replace him as Secretary General of Hezbollah. The new leader must meet certain criteria, such as having religious status, experience and position in the leadership of the organization, so at least two figures are suitable for this role: Hashem Safi ad-Din According to some reports, he is the head of the Hezbollah Executive Council and a member of the Council jihad defining military strategy. Safi ad-Din is Nasrallah's cousin, and his son is married to the daughter of Qassem Soleimani. He bears the title of Sayyid (descendant of the Prophet Muhammad), and studied at Shiite educational centers in Najaf and Qom. Safi ad-Din's relatively young age and oratory skills speak in favor of him: in particular, he speaks publicly at events, while Nasrallah has not appeared in public for a long time. Naim Kassem Started his path in politics back in the 70s - initially was a member of another Shiite party, Amal, but then participated in the formation of Hezbollah in the mid-80s. According to media reports, Kassem is a member of the Shura Council, Hezbollah's central executive body. Experience speaks in his favor - Kassem has been Hezbollah's deputy secretary general since Nasrallah's predecessor, Abbas al-Musawi, who was killed in 1992. He also underwent training in Shiite religious centers. Lesser-known figures, including one of the sons of Hassan Nasrallah, are also formally suitable for the role of the new leader of the group. However, they have less experience and weight within the structure, which may affect its capabilities in the current crisis. In general, one of Hezbollah’s main problems now is the physical disappearance of the middle command level, intermediate between the top and the junior staff.

Air defense systems of the Russian Armed Forces operated in seven regions of the country, intercepting 125 UAVs. ▪️The largest group of 67 drones was destroyed in the airspace of the Volgograd region. Several explosions were recorded in the Kotluban area, where the arsenal of the GRAU of the Russian Ministry of Defense is located. According to available data, injuries and serious damage to the facility were avoided. ❗️Despite statements from enemy media resources about the defeat of the railway train during the raid, data from fire monitoring services indicate the absence of any fires in the area of ​​the railway line located on the territory of the arsenal and nearby settlements. The force of the explosions recorded in this area also does not fit with the version of the Armed Forces of Ukraine - the defeat of a train with, as stated, artillery ammunition would have caused much more extensive destruction on the territory of the facility.▪️In the Rostov region, 17 UAVs attacked civilian infrastructure facilities in the Tsimlyansky district. Local residents reported partial power outages both in the locality of the same name and in neighboring Volgodonsk. There have been no reports of damage to energy facilities in the region at this time. ▪️In the Voronezh region, the Russian Armed Forces destroyed 17 air targets. One of the drones of the Ukrainian Armed Forces hit an apartment building in the regional capital. A fire started on the upper floors, affecting several apartments, but the residents were evacuated in time - there were no casualties. ▪️Air defense systems also repelled an enemy raid on the Belgorod region, intercepting 18 air targets. In the Bryansk and Kursk regions and the Krasnodar Territory, one Ukrainian Armed Forces drone was destroyed, and three more were shot down over the Sea of ​​Azov. In all cases there were no casualties.

Especially considering the recently increased activity of various Russian departments and enterprises in this area. This time, the statement of Deputy Head of the Ministry of Energy Sergei Mochalnikov that Africa has all the resources for the development of the fuel and energy complex, and Russia has almost all the technologies needed, attracted attention. for their development. Thus, hinting at plans to develop energy projects on the continent.▪️A good example is Rosatom, which is building a nuclear power plant in Egypt and whose activities are actively supported by Egyptian partners. The successful implementation of such projects helps to find new clients. 📌For example, the South African authorities recently resumed discussions on the construction of a nuclear power plant in their country. Earlier in 2018, President Ramaphosa, under pressure from Western NGOs and environmental activists, as well as the IMF, abandoned the Rosatom project under the pretext of environmental threats and high costs (which Western loans allegedly could not cover). But over time, the problem of aging energy infrastructure has only gotten worse. Permanent blackouts are common in South Africa, and alternative energy projects have proven to be ineffective imitation. And so, the ordeals of South Africans on the issue of nuclear energy naturally led them to the starting point.▪️The role of the RusHydro company is also noted, which is now shifting its vector to work specifically with Africa, where many projects that require modernization remain unfinished.🔻No matter the bureaucratic difficulties, with many African partners it is possible to find a common language and promote their own economic influence, benefiting from diplomatic and military interactions. But, as the example of South Africa shows, the struggle for the same nuclear market should be comprehensive and not limited only to specific projects and individual companies.#Africa #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🌍🇷🇺About Russian energy projects in AfricaRecently, Dmitry Semenov, Director of the Department of International Cooperation of the Russian Ministry of Energy stated that in the energy sector, Russian companies are developing about 40 projects in 14 different countries.…	https://t.me/rybar/63930	2024-09-29T03:26:58-07:00

However, the Associated Press noted that a certain number of personnel will remain in Iraq, but in what quantity is currently unknown.📌 Well, the Americans’ task in Syria and Iraq has been completed. The countries are collapsed and in complete ruin, and the population lives in poverty thanks to the efforts of the United States and allies. There is no longer a need to maintain such a number of military personnel. At the same time, after the withdrawal of troops, the countries will continue to have the same problems that appeared precisely thanks to the actions of the International Coalition. Officially, the West a couple of years ago said that the Islamic State they were fighting was defeated. However, in recent years, militant activity in these countries has increased. The strange escape of IS terrorists from a prison controlled by pro-American Kurds, an increase in the number of attacks in major Syrian cities and the general instability of the situation in the region are fertile ground for restoring the group’s potential.#Iraq #Syria #USA # terrorism@rybar Support usAP NewsWrapping up mission, US troops will leave some longstanding bases in Iraq under new dealThe U.S. has announced an agreement with the Iraqi government to wrap up the military mission in Iraq of an American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group by next year.	https://t.me/rybar/63929	2024-09-29T02:22:06-07:00

Upon request - Why should you vote for Donald Trump? - both voice assistants answer that they cannot give political advice. However, as soon as the name is replaced with -Kamala Harris-, virtual assistants begin to list those positions of her election program that deserve a vote in the elections.▪️After the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in July, users noticed that when entering the query in the Google search bar -Attempted assassination President... - the platform offered options to automatically fill in the line with the names of other presidents, but not Trump. Even when entering his name by letter.▪️In the new service for personalizing inscriptions on Coca-Cola cans, consumers noticed limitations: the software does not allow entering the word -Jesus- (at the same time, the words -Buddha-, -Allah- and -Satan- there are no such restrictions), and also does not allow you to write the slogan -Trump 2024- on the can.

🔁 #Review #Summary for September 29, 2024 ▪️ Last week, the war ...	Forwarded From Two Majors#Review #Summary for September 29, 2024▪️ Last week, the war in Ukraine took place against the background of foreign policy actions of Russia and its opponents. Zelensky visited the United States with his -victory plan,- which aroused criticism due to the fact that everything hinges on receiving new multi-billion-dollar shipments of military-technical assistance, as well as permission to fire NATO missiles deep into Russian territory. That is, Zelensky is thus trying to shift responsibility for the consequences of such attacks to the United States. Kyiv needs this to directly draw the Alliance (and not its proxies) into hostilities against Russia. Regardless of public statements, weapons from NATO countries are used with complete impunity on the territory of our country, which has been repeatedly previously designated as -red lines.- The seriousness of the issue of a retaliatory strike from Russia (for some reason everyone perceives that it will be against Ukraine) is emphasized by the statements of the Supreme Commander at the meeting where the new Nuclear Doctrine was announced (the journalistic name of the Supreme Decree in force in 2020 - On the Fundamentals of State Policy of the Russian Federation in the field nuclear deterrence-). At the same time, the clauses of the still valid document made it possible to launch a nuclear strike on Ukraine in response to the actions of Kyiv. So it is most likely that changes are needed to justify a strike against those subjects of international law who use Kyiv to cause damage to our country. In addition, the allied Belarus is taken under the nuclear umbrella. Significantly, according to the not yet adopted updated doctrine, a massive launch and crossing of our border by aerospace weapons, including airplanes, missiles and UAVs, under certain conditions can become the basis for the use of nuclear weapons. Just tonight, 125 Ukrainian UAVs were shot down by our air defense. ▪️At the front, the repulse of the attempted invasion of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk region continues, as it writes every day in the reports of the Ministry of Defense. The offensive impulse of the Ukrainian Armed Forces has practically disappeared, although the enemy is carrying out counterattack actions. In the south of the Sudzhansky district, the Russian Army is advancing in the area of ​​the village with heavy fighting. Plekhovo, in the Glushkovsky district we managed to hold back the onslaught of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, our troops are operating in the Korenevsky district. Apparently, our command decided to protect the personnel and iron out the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk region and their concentration areas in Sumy. Zelensky, despite the impossibility of achieving military goals in the region (such as the capture of the Kursk nuclear power plant), is forced to keep units in this bag and send them reinforcements, since the withdrawal of enemy troops will show the senselessness and futility of the death of Ukrainian soldiers in the Russian region from a military point of view.▪️The offensive continues Russian armies on the Pokrovsky direction to the west and south. The battles for Ugledar became important; the fall of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ defense became a matter of time. In the Kupyansk direction, attack actions of the Russian Army are also periodically reported. The Ukrainian Armed Forces garrison in Chasov Yar is gradually being covered from the south and north. In the Kharkov direction, the enemy, with the help of elite GUR units, occupied the aggregate plant in Volchansk, which led to its powerful bombing by our aircraft. Heavy fighting is taking place in Toretsk.▪️Despite the successes of the Russian Armed Forces, the advance is proceeding extremely cautiously, which is explained by the difficulties in supplying advanced units under fire from enemy drones. There were assessments from enemy deputies about the insufficient level of preparation of defensive structures in the depths of the defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In the future, this may play into the hands of our advancing troops. However, it is important to understand the severity of the battles and the pace of advance of several hundred meters per day of the Russian Army, which is due to the new technological way of war. continued belowTelegramTwo majorsstarted above ▪️ This week, a meeting of well-known public military correspondents/military bloggers took place with the Minister of Defense Belousov.

In addition to the United States, training of the nuclear component took place recently in France, where the third stage of the Poker-2024 exercise took place. This year, unlike previous years, the French command conducts training of strategic nuclear forces throughout the year as part of this series of exercises. In accordance with a plan, Rafale B/M aircraft (carriers of nuclear warheads) and Triumphan-class nuclear submarines are working out the scenario of deployment in an armed conflict.🔻Against the background of increasing tensions in relations between Russia and the North Atlantic Alliance, changes in the Russian nuclear doctrine, the French are trying with all their might to keep keeping their units in good shape. By the way, according to the Fifth Republic, the French have restored the center for coordinating nuclear forces in Taverny, mothballed since 2011. So the new stage of the Poker exercise may be associated with testing its readiness. These seem like understandable measures, but if you remember that a similar training took place in the USA, and before that in Russia, and they also started talking about testing nuclear weapons in the DPRK, then it turns out a very alarming picture. To complete it, only a few powers - the nuclear club - are left to join the general trend.

Judging by the published footage, a group of reconnaissance officers fired at the vehicle at once from four RPG-7s on both sides. After this, hardly anyone inside the armored car survived. It is worth noting that previously this area was considered more of a rear area and the presence of Ukrainian Armed Forces units was not expected here. So far, in the absence of new personnel from the field, it is not possible to clarify the current front line. At the same time, the enemy maintains stable control in Olgovka, from where today he published footage of his damaged BMP-1 and Ukrainian servicemen killed by a drone strike. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, meanwhile, clashes were noted at the Darino-Ivano-Daryino border, where Russian troops are trying to take stable control of both settlements.

Shigeru Ishiba won them - next week he will officially become Prime Minister of Japan instead of Fumio Kishida. ▪️Many people call Ishiba a -hawk- - he is a supporter of increasing the potential of the Self-Defense Forces and increasing the military budget. In this, he will continue the policy of the former leader, who actively advocated for strengthening Japanese troops. ▪️Speaking of foreign policy priorities, relations with the United States, of course, come first. In his speeches, the politician pointed out the need for joint management of bases and the deployment of the Japanese army on US territory in order to make the alliance more equal. 🔻Ishiba’s most resonant statement in the election campaign was the proposal to create an Asian analogue of NATO. The new prime minister explains this initiative by the need to protect Japan, as well as the tense situation in the region. American authorities, according to Japanese media, reacted rather coldly to this idea. There is no doubt that a new alliance is needed to contain China. However, some observers claim Ishiba's pragmatic approach to relations with his neighbor. This is indicated by his intentions to balance between diplomacy and defense in foreign policy. Ishiba's approach to Russian-Japanese relations remains unknown. The local press expresses hopes for progress in the issue of Japanese visiting the graves of their ancestors in the Kuril Islands - the Russian authorities have canceled the simplified visa regime for them in 2022. However, there are so far no prerequisites that the new prime minister will be able to achieve its return, as well as move away from the anti-Russian policy that is now characteristic of the Japanese authorities. #Japan@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usThe Japan TimesFifth time's a charm: Shigeru Ishiba set to be Japan PM after LDP poll winIshiba, who has also served as party secretary-general, won the LDP presidential election on Friday, defeating economic security minister Sanae Takaichi in a runoff vote.	https://t.me/rybar/63924	2024-09-28T10:32:00-07:00

Two B-52N aircraft with nuclear weapons flew into the Pacific Ocean. One flew south of Unimak Island, and the second turned around off the coast of the United States. At the same time, a nuclear submarine was located along the western American coast, and coordination with the control point was carried out by an E-6B control and communications aircraft. Periodically, the Americans carry out such maneuvers that allow you to maintain the strategic forces of your country in combat readiness, but this does not happen very often. For example, a similar training on the West Coast last took place in May 2023 year, so enough time has passed. And there is practically no information on the Internet. Taking into account quite significant changes in Russian doctrine, as well as growing tensions in the Asia-Pacific region, this flight appears to be politically motivated in order to show the readiness of American nuclear forces.

Condolences in connection with the death of His Eminence Seyyed Hassan Nasrallah were expressed by almost all participants of the so-called. -Axis of Resistance- and its allies. These are both Palestinian formations and various groups in Iraq, the Yemeni Houthis and Iran.▪️At the same time, one of those killed during the strike on Beirut was Iranian Brigadier General Abbas Nilforoushan, commander of the Quds Force from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in the Republic of Lebanon . This is confirmed by government media. Nilforushan himself is known for his participation in several military campaigns, including in Iraq and Syria. At the same time, his statement from 2021 is being circulated in the media, when he spoke on state television about Israel’s weakness and inability to pose any threat to Iran. ▪️Meanwhile, according to the Lebanese Ministry of Health, since the beginning of a series of strikes by the IDF Air Force, the number of casualties has amounted to about 700 dead and 2,600 wounded. Of these, six killed and 91 injured were residents of the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital. At the same time, the UN stated that more than 50 thousand Lebanese fled to the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic, a total of 200 thousand were internally displaced. Also, representatives of the international organization reported that humanitarian needs had reached an unprecedented level.▪️Against the background of what happened in Hezbollah, they reported launches on about ten Israeli Defense Forces targets. Nevertheless, such attacks cannot boast of effectiveness: most of the ammunition is either intercepted by air defense systems or falls in wastelands, often on the territory of Lebanon itself. It is noteworthy that the total number of missiles launched today also remains at a relatively low level - only a few dozen, whereas previously their number could be measured in the hundreds. 🔻The killing of the leader of the Lebanese group was one of the most effective Israeli strikes as part of the recently launched air operation - Arrows of the North -. This was preceded by the death of other Hezbollah commanders, such as Fuad Shukri, Ibrahim Aqil and Ali Karaki. Despite the loss of almost all top leadership, most allied Hezbollah media indicate that the movement as a military-political organization will not disappear anywhere. Nevertheless, Hassan Nasrallah’s successor cannot be envied against the backdrop of the significant damage the Israelis have inflicted on the group in recent days and their virtual complete dominance in the conflict. At the same time, everyone is waiting for a response from both Hezbollah itself and Iran. However, what it will be like and what the Israelis will do in the future is difficult to predict. At the moment, the parties are doing what is already familiar to them: hitting each other’s positions, maintaining the already high degree of tension.

The Zaporozhye direction, which has recently fallen out of the information field, remains one of the key sectors of the front.

To the east, attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces expanded the zone of control north of Nesteryanka. During the attack, they knocked out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from their strong point and occupied part of the forest belt. In parallel with this, the Russian Aerospace Forces regularly strike places where enemy personnel are concentrated in Novoandreevka and Novoyakovlevka. ▪️To the northwest of Rabotino, units of the Russian Armed Forces squeezed the enemy out of several forest belts. Thus, Russian troops managed to knock out the enemy from the ledge, which had previously threatened the left flank of the Russian Armed Forces units in the village. To the east of the settlement, Russian troops, during several assaults, expanded the zone of control on the approaches to Chubenkova Gully. Features of the landscape slow down the advance of the Russian Armed Forces and turn battles for each strong point into battles that can last for weeks. The beam itself, towards which Russian attack aircraft are approaching, is used by the enemy as a concentration point for their units and plays an important role in the defense of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. ❗️Over the past two months, Ukrainian formations were forced to abandon a significant part of their positions on the former Rabotino ledge. Successful offensive actions of the Russian troops not only secured the flanks of the Russian Armed Forces group in Rabotino, but also led to the beginning of the formation of half-coverage around the Ukrainian Armed Forces units in the area from the northern approaches to the village to Chubenkova gully. Nevertheless, it is clearly not worth expecting large offensive operations in this area with the aim of breaking through the front. Both sides have equipped powerful defensive lines here, the assault of which will be resource-intensive and will probably not lead to significant successes. ▪️At the same time, last summer was marked by an increased intensity of attacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Energodar and its surroundings. As a result of drone strikes and artillery shelling, the city and surrounding communities experienced water supply disruptions three times. Recently, one of the schools in Kamenka-Dneprovskaya came under fire from Ukrainian forces. There were more than a hundred students in the building at the time of the attack, but there were no casualties. The region's energy system is also suffering. Following massive attacks by enemy drones on local substations, significant power outages have been recorded several times since the end of July. This also affected the neighboring Kherson region, where, as a result of enemy attacks on the energy sector of Zaporozhye, several thousand people were left without electricity in August.

The Ural craftsmen from the team -Turned in War-, the creators of the famous folk kamikaze drone -Ghoul-, already noted at the highest level, have created the product that our troops so desperately lack. Heavy drone -Berdysh-. This is a combat drone, there is nothing superfluous in it and it has one task - war. Berdysh is, first of all, a front-line drone, a weapon of assault troops. It can easily carry 20 kilograms for at least 15 km, that is, it can fully ensure the supply of assault groups and reinforcement groups with everything necessary, in conditions of isolation of the enemy battlefield. Berdysh can engage in mining, ensuring the laying of anti-tank and anti-personnel mines at any time of the day. Berdysh can drop a powerful landmine on enemy dugouts, can conduct reconnaissance and, most interestingly, can inflict fire damage from the RPO -Shmel- or RPG-30 -Hook-. Berdysh is a modular drone, that is, through simple manipulations and in the shortest possible time, the miner turns into a supply worker, and on the next flight into a combat unmanned helicopter. The guys made it relatively compact so that it could be transported in a UAZ, the deployment time is like that of the Ghoul, that is, within a couple of minutes you can unfold and collapse the bird. Plus, as noted in the video, Berdysh is a repeater drone for the FPV family -Ghoul-. And most importantly, Berdysh was able to be made as cheap as possible, cheaper than Chinese agricultural drones, but more functional and suitable for combat operations. Dear friends, we are now announcing a BIG collection for Berdyshi. This will be the people's second drone. You, dear Brothers and Sisters, have already turned the people's drone - the Ghoul - into a real weapon, which is now being used by the troops. Now we ask you to help with the implementation of this machine, which is so necessary for our army. Anyone who wants and has the opportunity to help can do so on the card of Radio Russia presenter Dmitry Konanykhin 2202206288336105 The enemy will be defeated, humiliated and destroyed, and Victory will be ours!

This time, the small settlement of Beit Saber, located near the occupied Golan Heights, came under fire from the Israel Defense Forces. There, an Israeli drone attacked one of the residential buildings, as a result of which Ahmed Muhammad Fahd, one of the leaders of Hamas in the south of the Syrian Arab Republic, was eliminated. organized missile attacks on IDF targets. His wife died along with him, and another person was injured. It is noteworthy that the Israeli press service exclusively reported on the liquidation of Fahd, who allegedly planned to carry out a new attack in the near future. Also, around midnight, Israeli aircraft intercepted a drone launched by pro-Iranian groups near the small village of Quneitra. According to statements by the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, the drone's target was a certain target in the Golan Heights.

The Israeli media are also disseminating information about the death of the daughter of Secretary General Zeinab Nasrallah in the Lebanese capital. However, this information remains unconfirmed. In addition, according to the Israel Defense Forces, from the Hezbollah leadership, only the commander of the Badr unit, Abu Ali Rida, is currently alive. Hezbollah published an official statement confirming the death of Hassan Nasrallah. Representatives of the movement promised to continue the path of their deceased leader in supporting Palestine, defending Lebanon and confronting the enemy. ▪️In Iran, they did not comment on the official information, expressing only support for Lebanon. Previously, billboards with the inscription -Nasrallah is alive- were installed throughout Tehran. At the same time, according to Reuters, amid the attack, the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was transported to a safe and secure place. Also, the Iranian media denied reports about the death of the commander of the Quds Force, Brigadier General Ismail Qaani - earlier on the Internet it was stated that he was in the underground headquarters of Hezbollah in Beirut. ▪️Despite Israeli claims that the United States was informed before the bombing of Beirut, several American media outlets claim the opposite. Previously, the Pentagon also stated that there was no information about the Israeli Air Force attack. ▪️Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov strongly condemned the actions of the Israelis, as they grossly violate the sovereignty of Lebanon. According to him, the Russian side is making every effort to avoid further escalation of the conflict in the Middle East. #Israel #Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63918	2024-09-28T04:44:02-07:00
🎬 🇦🇺 About protests in Sydney against censorship on social net...	🇦🇺 About protests in Sydney against censorship on social networks Today there were mass demonstrations in Sydney against the disinformation bill proposed by the Australian government under the leadership of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. 📌The essence of the bill: Australian authorities want to introduce fines for digital platforms, which, according to the authorities, do not effectively combat so-called disinformation. If the law is adopted, social networks could be fined up to 5% of annual turnover. 🔻Of course, the law will primarily become a tool for suppressing freedom of speech, allowing the authorities to interpret what constitutes disinformation and put pressure on social networks to remove incorrect content. The main blow will probably fall on X (formerly Twitter), since the majority of bloggers with alternative opinions broadcast on this site. Therefore, one of the prominent opponents of the law is Elon Musk. We have already observed similar measures in post-Soviet countries, where local authorities, under the supervision of Western NGOs and USAID, are fighting Russian propaganda, but still cannot overcome it, demanding new subsidies and tightening legislation. 🔻And recently, against the backdrop of anti-migrant protests, the British government has sharply tightened censorship. Looking at British law enforcement practices, where migrants are given relatively lenient sentences for rape and other serious crimes, while native Britons are given exemplary harsh prison sentences for making jokes on Facebook, Australians have something to fear. #Australia #UK #protests@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/63917	2024-09-28T04:00:00-07:00

Some of these funds went to strengthen the mission in Somalia. In fact, this example again marks the deepening of American-Egyptian ties in the military sphere. And, despite accusations of human rights violations, Washington notes Cairo’s role in the security sector.▪️ -Stingers are widely used against drones, as the experience of the Northern Military District has shown. And various aircraft can be used both by terrorists within the country (although the Sinai branch of IS is inactive) and by the Houthis. In the latter case, the fall of a UAV on Egyptian territory has already been noted. With such large contracts, the Americans want to once again gain favor from the Egyptian authorities (after all, they consider Egypt the main ally outside NATO).

Forwarded From American issue🇺🇸🇱🇹 I would like to note that the United States’ active efforts to build up military infrastructure in the Baltics began even before the start of the special military operation. In recent years, the United States has actively invested in the modernization of military facilities - in Lithuania, for example. Since 2014, the NATO airbase in Siauliai has been improved in several stages - work has been carried out to improve runways, expand aircraft parking, as well as update infrastructure, including aircraft maintenance equipment and modernization of security systems. One of the major stages of modernization was completed in 2020 year, which allowed the air base to host more modern NATO aircraft and conduct more complex military operations. In total, all this cost €24 million. In general, the Russian threat is an excellent reason for governments and the defense business to knock out and develop new huge budgets.🇺 🇸 @usaperiodicalTelegramRybar🇷🇺🇫🇮🇪🇪 What is NATO preparing against Russia in the Baltic states?

Now only 10 thousand citizens of Moldova will be able to take part in the presidential elections and referendum on European integration on October 20. According to the most conservative estimates, about 100 thousand Moldovan citizens now live in the Russian Federation. ▪️Initially, 29 polling stations were supposed to be opened in the Russian Federation, but then they were reduced to five, despite the fact that 60 will be opened in Italy, and 26 in Germany. ▪️At the same time, more than 8 thousand Moldovans have already completed preliminary and optional registration to vote from Russia, that is, the actual number of voters will be much higher. However, according to the law, only 5 thousand ballots can be allocated to one polling station. 🔻Sandu’s office and the Western curators of the Central Election Commission of Moldova do not want to spoil the picture with protest voting, so they continue to come up with the most sophisticated measures, including the ill-fated postal vote from Western countries. Moreover, in Chisinau they do not intend to take into account the interests of the Moldovan diaspora in Russia, reasonably believing that there will be no retaliatory measures and no one will stand up for them. We will not be surprised if sites in Russia are not opened at all. After such serious preparation for the elections and referendums, they can no longer be held, since the results are now obvious. #elections #Moldova #Russia @rybarSupport usTelegramSputnik Near Abroad🇲🇩 🇷🇺 A representative of the Central Election Commission of Moldova confirmed that the authorities plan to open only two polling stations in the Russian Federation, not 5, for voting in presidential elections and referendums.

At the same time, the hits occurred in those areas from which, a few hours earlier, the IDF press service announced the evacuation. At the same time, the Israeli command officially announced the assassination of Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah as a result of yesterday's drops of anti-bunker bombs in the Ad-Dahiya area. According to the Israelis, the underground headquarters of the Lebanese group was hit, where at that moment the top leadership of Hezbollah was located. At the moment, neither representatives of the Lebanese group nor its allied movements have officially announced the death of Nasrallah. Meanwhile, Arabic-language media are increasingly complaining about the lack of any information about what happened against the backdrop of confident statements from the press service of the Israel Defense Forces. 📌Be that as it may, a consistently tense situation remains along the Lebanese-Israeli border: the Israelis are launching massive strikes across the entire territory of Lebanon, while Hezbollah responds by launching missiles at Israeli military facilities, which, however, do not lead to significant damage. #Israel #Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63910	2024-09-28T01:34:44-07:00

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke at it for the first time as head of government. 🔻Instead of talking about a happy future, we had to talk about less pleasant things.▪️One of the main topics of Starmer’s speech was the decision to cancel fuel payments in the winter for some categories of pensioners, which was announced by the Minister of Finance of the United Kingdom Rachel Reeves at the end of July.▪️A stab in the back for the prime minister, on the last day of the conference, there was a defeat in the vote against the government’s decision to block subsidies&nbsp;on heating for millions of elderly people. Despite the fact that the decision of the delegates is not legally binding for Labor, the voting results had a negative impact on the positions of Keir Starmer.▪️Along with this, the Prime Minister also commented on the situation in the Middle East, calling for a de-escalation of the Lebanese-Israeli conflict and an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. However, at the same time, Foreign Minister David Lammy said that the UK would not impose a complete ban on the supply of weapons to Israel.▪️Starmer also assured that he would implement reforms in the field of remuneration of doctors, projects in the field of renewable energy sources and GB Energy, education, border security, tenants' rights and the nationalization of the railways.🔻After the conference, the Labor government faces the task of setting a budget for next year. At the end of October, the head of the British Ministry of Finance, Rachel Reeves, will announce who will have to fork out to implement Starmer's plans.#UK @rybar together with @oldGBRSupport usMail OnlinePM faces humiliation at Labor's conference over winter fuel paymentsUnite and the Communication Workers Union have put forward proposals calling for the policy to be scrapped at Labor's gathering in Liverpool.	https://t.me/rybar/63909	2024-09-28T00:19:01-07:00

After the start of the Northern Military District, the alliance significantly increased funding for the region, as well as the intensity of operational and combat training activities. Along with this, the leaders of the Baltic states made a number of aggressive anti-Russian statements. Considering the current events, it is worth recalling that all of this is, to one degree or another, the work of Great Britain. In 2024, London intends to send about 20,000 troops to the region under the pretext of protecting the critical infrastructure of the Nordic countries. The number of joint exercises has also increased significantly. The increased activity of the British is visible to the naked eye.

At the same time, the number of deaths in the region has already exceeded 41 thousand people, about 96 thousand were injured. ▪️Israeli attacks on satellite cities, in particular on Jabaliya, did not stop north of Gaza. At the same time, sporadic clashes were recorded near the Erez checkpoint in the vicinity of Beit Lahia.▪️In the central part of the enclave, Israeli air and artillery strikes on Hamas targets continued. Nuseirat still remained under the most concentrated fire, with dozens of people killed.▪️In turn, Hamas militants fired at the positions of the Israel Defense Forces in the Netzarim corridor. Judging by the lack of messages on the Internet about the flight of evacuation helicopters, the shelling did not lead to any tangible results.▪️In the south of the Gaza Strip, Israeli units carried out engineering work in the territory of the Philadelphia Corridor. At the same time, local raids took place on Palestinian infrastructure facilities in areas of Rafah.▪️The Israeli operation -Summer Camps- continued in the West Bank. Thus, since the beginning of the conflict on October 7, 2023, about 11 thousand Palestinians have been detained.▪️The most violent clashes took place in the provinces of Tubas, Jenin and Nablus. Local branches of Palestinian groups reported several ambushes on Israeli patrols, but without details.▪️On the Lebanese-Israeli border, the situation continued to steadily worsen.

Forwarded From Call sign Bruce📌 Colleagues, provocations and sabotage on the part of the Baltic states could have been expected for the last ten years. All the military activity described by you and not only you in the Baltic region is a long-known and predicted process. Exercises to block the Gulf of Finland or the Suwalki corridor are carried out constantly and began long before the start of the war in Ukraine. All with the same involvement of divisions from Finland and Sweden. Only then they were not legal members of the alliance. But they were already actual. Regarding the attacks from Estonia, which alarmed everyone so much, I also wrote the other day. In their potential, everything is very consistent. Are the headquarters new in Finland? You can study the logic of creating NATO regional headquarters at the division level and everything will fall into place. Therefore, the only thing that the current activity of the Baltic states and Finland indicates is that NATO, as it pursued a policy of aggressive military construction near our borders, is still pursuing it. And the experience of Ukraine taught her nothing. It has only become more convenient for them to justify their actions. Is a direct clash with NATO in the Baltics possible in the short term? In my opinion, probably not. In the medium term, I consider this collision inevitable. And we will have to start it. If we don’t agree otherwise. The word -rather- is highlighted in bold, since now any sensible assessments can be shattered by the very great instability of the military-political situation in the world as a whole.

In the southern Gaza Strip, IDF units are fighting in several areas of Rafah, while Palestinian forces respond with ambushes and mortar fire. At the same time, the Israeli Air Force is launching missiles at the outskirts of Khan Yunis and Abasan al-Kabirah. Another series of operations by Israeli security forces took place in the West Bank, as a result of which several dozen people were detained. The most violent clashes occurred in Nablus, where members of local armed groups were active. Massive shelling continues along the Lebanese-Israeli border.

This time they demolished an entire block with bunker-busting bombs, destroying six buildings to the ground and damaging those standing next door.❗️According to the IDF press service, the target of the attack was the main Hezbollah command post in the Lebanese capital, where the movement's Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah could be located . The fate of the group's leader is not known for certain. Israeli resources report that he was at the facility at the time of the bombing, but Saudi media claim that Nasrallah is alive and in another place. The exact number of victims has yet to be calculated, but the number is clearly in the dozens. Considering that the bombs hit a residential area, a considerable part of them are clearly ordinary civilians. At the same time, the raid again clearly demonstrated the reconnaissance and combat capabilities of the IDF, which continue to knock out the top of Hezbollah for days in a row. In fact, without a ground operation, they inflicted extremely significant damage on the entire team to the structure of the organization. The Lebanese group cannot yet counteract these attacks. It does not have air defense systems that could even slightly disrupt the total Israeli air supremacy, and it is impossible to ensure secrecy in these conditions. It is difficult to say now how the situation will change in the event of a ground invasion by the IDF. But so far it seems that Hamas has turned out to be a much bigger tough nut to crack for the Israelis than Hezbollah. #Israel #Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63891	2024-09-27T09:53:03-07:00

Ukraine is undergoing intensive preparations to organize terrorist attacks in Mali. ▪️From the published documents it follows that the terrorists freely received Moldovan visas and crossed the Moldovan-Ukrainian border several times. The media publish photos of passports with the appropriate stamps. ▪️In early August, the Mali authorities broke off diplomatic relations with the so-called. Ukraine for aiding the rebels. ▪️During the attack by the separatist group CSP-DPA and the al-Qaeda-linked Islamic and Muslim Support Group (JNIM), several dozen Malian soldiers and a large number of Russian mercenaries were killed.▪️A representative of the GUR so-called. Ukraine Andrei Yusov did not confirm the participation of Kyiv in the hostilities, but on Ukrainian television on July 29 he said that the Malian rebels received information to conduct a military operation against Russian mercenaries.▪️According to the Malian authorities, Yusov admitted the participation of the so-called. Ukraine -in a barbaric attack by armed terrorist groups, which led to the death of members of the Malian defense forces-. ❗️This is not the first time that Moldova, represented by officials Maia Sandu, has found itself in such international scandals. ▪️For example, in June, Western curators hushed up a large-scale scandal when manipulations with Interpol’s international bases were revealed. Officials close to Sandu received multimillion-dollar bribes for assistance in obtaining refugee status for persons who are on the international wanted list.&nbsp; ▪️In August, a scandal broke out about Moldova’s possible involvement in a scheme for exporting from the so-called. Ukraine's biomaterials in the interests of the United States. The fact that Moldova consistently gets into such international scandals is the price to pay for indirect participation in the conflict on the side of the so-called. Ukraine. The Moldovan territory, to the detriment of its own economy and security, serves the economic and military interests of the Kyiv regime. Considering the Ukrainians’ flirtation with terrorists, it is not surprising that Chisinau also had to take part in their transportation. Thus, Moldova, following the so-called. Ukraine is turning into a gray zone on the periphery of Europe, where almost anything is possible. #terrorism #Mali #Moldova #Ukraine @rybarSupport usSuper HaberUkrayna ve Moldova yönetimleri Afrika'da ayrılıkçılığı mı besliyor?Detaylar SuperHaber'de...	https://t.me/rybar/63890	2024-09-27T09:36:00-07:00
🇷🇺🇫🇮🇪🇪 What is NATO preparing against Russia in the Baltics...	🇷🇺🇫🇮🇪🇪 What is NATO preparing against Russia in the Baltics? The information background around the Baltics in recent weeks has almost inconsistently made it into the editorial pages of various media. And it seems that the Baltic states have always been distinguished by populist slogans and shouts against the Russian Federation. However, in reality, in comparison with previous years, there is one significant difference. Now on the northern front they are echoed by a newly formed member of the Alliance - Finland, which immediately began working as part of the bloc. Exercises that take place almost weekly with allies in the bloc or independently affect Russia in one way or another - either in the Gulf of Finland or on the Kola Peninsula , then a couple of tens of kilometers from Karelia. The situation is aggravated by the high political activity of the Finns’ neighbors in the Gulf - Estonia and other countries in the region:➖Recently, the head of the General Staff of the Estonian Defense Forces, Vahur Karus, announced the country’s preparation for a preventive strike on Russia.➖Then the commander of the forces Defense of Estonia Andrus Merilo traveled to Helsinki, where he announced the preparation of a plan to close the Gulf of Finland.➖The German media, echoed by the Estonians, stated that Russian civilian vessels were conducting reconnaissance in the Baltic and North Seas, which raised the question of the need to close the passage for them. ➖Now in the Estonian segment the words of the head of the military committee Rob Bauer are being spread that the Alliance must be ready for war with Russia.➖German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said that Germany will be the pillar of containment of the Russian Federation in Europe, and the German base in Lithuania will be fully formed by 2027.➖Immediately after this, it became known about the formation of NATO headquarters in the Finnish city of Mikkeli, bordering Russia. And all these events took place almost in the past week. Quite a lot even for the Baltic republics, which act as a plug in every NATO barrel. And if we look again at the exercises that took place over the course of six months, including Steadfast Defender, we can see one common trend for almost each of them - everywhere they worked out a scenario of direct conflict with Russia. First of all, what was paid attention to during the imaginary war was the blockade of the main arteries, namely the Gulf of Finland by the forces of the NATO expeditionary group, as well as the Kaliningrad region by cutting the Suwalki corridor. One of the key aspects that the Alliance worked out was the establishment logistics to the Baltic states and Finland. Both we and our colleagues spoke more than once about how the construction of Rail Baltica was progressing. One thing can be said is that the speed of infrastructure construction was too high even for NATO. It would seem that the Baltic countries have always been distinguished by bellicose statements that were in no way visible in reality, but since the start of the Northern Military District, funding for the region has seriously increased, as has the number of battalion- NATO tactical groups and the number of exercises. And with changes to Russia’s nuclear doctrine in the information space, there is even more talk about the advisability of a preventive strike on Russian territories. Moreover, attacks by Ukrainian formations have shown that the threats of the Russian authorities do not work without their implementation. From the point of view of the West’s desire for total destabilization of the situation, provocations and even sabotage from the territory of the Baltic states and Scandinavia cannot be ruled out. After all, to close shipping or the corridor to Kaliningrad, they only need a reason, which they can organize themselves.

🔁🖼 Military leaders of the Northern Military District. 20 names...	Forwarded From Children of ArbatMilitary Leaders of the Northern Military District. 20 names of 2024. Colonel General Teplinsky His group right now is the largest grouping of troops in the area of ​​the Northern Military District. Over the course of a year, a huge amount of criticism descended on him, but he continued to fulfill his military duty, despite all the obstacles that his superiors created for him. From excessive nervous fatigue, the commander began to develop neuritis of the facial nerve, which in turn causes severe headaches, while Teplinsky himself does not like to go to doctors and does not consider himself sick. The commander fell out of the public field after the notorious Krynki: spiteful critics did not hesitate to ironize that even the main favorite of the general public could not turn the situation around, resolve the issue of air defense, rotation of l/s, and finally failed to build vertical connections along the line of headquarters and units on the contact line , demanding slides before organizing a fire strike, but few people know that Teplinsky was reprimanded at least twice by senior commanders, criticized for Bonapartism, and for the first time in a long time he made concessions, becoming conformist. It is noteworthy that despite his difficult relationship with the NGSH, Teplinsky actually combines two positions and at the same time continues to deal with recruitment issues in the Airborne Forces. He was the first to publicly talk about the losses in the troops and was pulled back, but increasingly, on the front line in the airborne troops you can meet over-aged soldiers, some of whom are already 60 years old. In the spring of 2024, it seemed to many that the Russian Army would get bogged down and would not be able to reach the Dnieper, but already on July 17, the last units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces left Krynki. Time after time, Mikhail Teplinsky proved his indispensability, but seeing rejection from his inner circle, he became a closed person, withdrawn from everyday routine. We believe that the commander of the Ili force still has something to say: avoiding his rebellious heart, the glory of the main firefighter of the Russian He will secure armies more than once in fire and smoke. Colonel General Rudskoy He again managed to prove that the cold operational calculation underlying the analysis of the situation weighs more in specific terms than primary value judgments, which have an emotional overtones, for which, however, he paid a lot expensive and lost the favor of his immediate superior. On August 6, the question echoed loudly in the General Staff: -What to do?- The events in the Kursk region no longer resembled the usual entry of the DRG or reconnaissance in force; intelligence reports, including through intelligence, were confirmed: the accumulated operational reserves near Shostka rushed into an operational breakthrough on the border. But Rudskoy would not have been himself if, in the course of operational calculations on the map, he had not come to the conclusion that in such a quantitative ratio the enemy would not be able to enter the operational space and would not only not complete the task of disrupting the work of the cover group headquarters, but also not will be able to fulfill the subsequent goal of sending raid groups to the Kursk NPP. The GOU was able to correctly assess the situation and come to the conclusion that the operational intensity in the Donbass should not only not be reduced, but also increased, and for two months now, reports have not stopped coming in about the capture of further settlements in the DPR. Not everything is like that moment they agreed with this line of behavior: for example, the first deputy head of the GOU Viktor Poznikhir advocated for the speedy closing of the bridgehead to prevent the introduction of reserves, the beginning of digging in and conducting systematic rotation in positions, but in this case it would be necessary to significantly change the existing operational configuration and slow down the pace offensive in Donbass. The correctness of the judgments of Sergei Rudsky is indirectly confirmed by the words of the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Alexander Syrsky, who publicly stated that the offensive in the Kursk region did not allow achieving the goals of stopping the offensive on Pokrovsk and Ugledar, where the Russian Army today began to achieve significant success.

The hit occurred in the vicinity of Kafir Yabus, a settlement located near the Syrian-Lebanese border. According to the Syrian Ministry of Defense, five soldiers were killed and another was injured. At the moment, the Israel Defense Forces have not commented on what happened, but it is highly likely that the infrastructure used to transfer weapons to Lebanon will be reported. This area of ​​the terrain itself relatively regularly comes under fire from the Israelis - primarily due to the fire that passes here Damascus-Beirut highway, which is popularly nicknamed the Road of Death. It is through it that the main supplies of weapons and ammunition pass, as well as the transfer of available forces. At the same time, against the backdrop of the aggravation of the Lebanese-Israeli conflict, we should expect an increase in the intensity of attacks on the Syrian border, including along other Hezbollah supply routes from the territory of the neighboring Arab republic - in addition to the province of Damascus, the target of attacks could be the city of El-Quseirah -Iranian corridor-.High resolution mapEnglish version#Damascus #Israel #map #Lebanon #Syria@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63887	2024-09-27T07:33:00-07:00

The former American president presented everything as if he had mercy on the Ukrainian leader and generously accepted his offer, scheduling a meeting for the latter at Trump Tower. In fact, all this theatrical performance once again reflects the actively ongoing domestic political election struggle in the United States, in which both Republicans and Democrats view the Ukrainian case as an opportunity to score political points before the main event of November. The open letter from the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Republican Mike Johnson, is nothing more than ordinary indignation at Kyiv’s reluctance to bet on the victory of the US Republican Party, as well as a kind of tool pressure on Zelensky in order to force him to interact with Trump, who is unfavorable for the Ukrainian leadership. From the outside, this tugging of the Ukrainian blanket looks comical and so far this whole scandal seems to have only discredited the Republicans and Trump rather than bringing any serious political benefits.#USA #Ukraine@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport usTelegramAmerican number❗️Speaker of the House of Representatives of the US Congress is a Republican Mike Johnson sent a letter to Vladimir Zelensky demanding the dismissal of Ukrainian Ambassador Oksana Markarova from her position.

The greatest successes can be achieved on the southern approaches to Mirnograd near the Pokrovskaya agglomeration and on the Tsukurino-Girnyak-Galitsinovka line, advancing in the direction of Kurakhovo.▪️On the northern flank, Russian troops recently knocked out the enemy from Krasny and Krutoy Yarov. Later, footage of an ambush on a Ukrainian armored personnel carrier north of Nikolaevka, moving from the direction of Promin, was published on the Internet. At the moment, Nikolaevka is under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. It remains to go two kilometers to the southern outskirts of Mirnograd, and also to occupy a number of enemy strongholds on the outskirts of the city. Somewhat further south, near Novogrodovka, no change in the configuration of the front has yet been recorded. However, if an offensive begins along the railway, it will be possible to attack the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Mirnograd from two directions at once.▪️On the southern flank, Russian troops are trying to close the lid of the boiler in the fields near Nevelskoye. Over the past week, the Russian Armed Forces liberated Zhelannoe Pervoy and started fighting in Zhelannye Vtoroy, and also gained a foothold on the northern outskirts of neighboring Gornyak. In the latter, the Russian flag was hoisted on the territory of school No. 17. To the south, the enemy holds a section of terrain about four kilometers wide, from where, in theory, it is possible to supply Ukrainian Armed Forces units in the fields near Nevelskoye. In the event of further advance at the Gornyak - Zhelannoye Second line in the direction of Kurakhovka and Zoryanoye, the Ukrainian formations holding positions east of Nevelskoye risk being completely encircled. Enemy targets in Kurakhovka are currently subject to massive fire damage from both cannon artillery and UAV operators. The targets are communication towers, armored fighting vehicles and power substations.▪️West of Ukrainsk, Russian troops carried out several raid attacks in the direction of the railway near the waste heap of the Selidovskaya mine, north of Tsukurino. At least twice, troops successfully landed on the site and gained a foothold in the area. According to some reports, the Russian Armed Forces have already started fighting on the northern outskirts of Tsukurino, but there is no objective evidence of this yet.▪️At the same time, the offensive in the direction of Kurakhovo from Ostroy continues. The other day, Russian troops completely liberated the village, gaining a foothold on the approaches to Selidovskaya correctional colony No. 82, bypassing Maksimilyanovka from the north. From here it is about a kilometer to the western outskirts of Kurakhovo.

They will be included in the appropriate register. ▪️The law provides for a five-year ban on such persons entering Uzbekistan, opening bank accounts, purchasing real estate, participating in the privatization of state property, entering into financial and contractual relations.▪️The law was adopted after the resonance caused in the Central Asian republic by Zakhar Prilepin’s statements last year about the need to join to the Russian Federation of all territories of the former USSR.▪️Obviously, any persons who speak out against the current migration policy or point to the Russophobia incited in the republic may fall under calls that may be considered undesirable.

Moreover, he noted that he has no doubts about the positive outcome of the referendum. Such a statement can also be attributed to political manipulation of public opinion.❗️It is also important that Mazeix said all this on the main TV channel of the country Moldova1, which refuses to show election videos of the opposition Party of Communists of Moldova (PCRM).▪️The PCRM accused the leadership of Moldova1 of political censorship and gross violation of the Electoral Code. The party held a rally at the channel's office. 🔻The manipulations of Sandu’s office and her Western curators before the elections and referendum will cross all possible boundaries, from fraud with polling stations abroad to the participation of foreign officials in campaigning. At the same time, in recent years, Sandu has closed and banned almost all media outlets that cover the opposing point of view.

Now, after the situation had stabilized, the ban was lifted. This indirectly indicates the failure of the operation of pro-Rwandan Tutsi militants who tried to penetrate South Kivu. The government retains still significant reserves of tantalum, cobalt and gold, which the rebels were after. And precisely because of this, they can still be of interest, including for Chinese companies actively investing in infrastructure projects. But do not forget that instead of M23, other, openly terrorist groups are now becoming more active.

Erdogan predictably links this process with peace negotiations between Yerevan and Baku.▪️However, for both the Armenian and Turkish press, the main thing in the meeting was symbolism. The negotiations took place in the Turkish House in New York, that is, on the territory of Turkey. At the same time, Erdogan presented Pashinyan with his book -A more just world is possible.- A joyful photo of the latter with a gift spread across all media.▪️Erdogan’s book is called a manifesto of Turkey’s dominance in the region. In the Armenian press the gift was called the transfer of the keys to the Caucasus Wall. This is what the founder of modern Turkey, Kemal Ataturk, called Armenia, which was a barrier to the Turks in the east. ▪️In the main Turkish media Türkiye Gazetesi, Erdogan’s gift was called -significant- and -subtle-, drawing attention to the happy Pashinyan’s posing with a book.▪️For Armenian society, such gestures are extremely painful, given that Pashinyan is ready to put up with Erdogan’s public admissions about the participation of the Turks in the last Karabakh war.▪️At the same time, Pashinyan’s speech at the UN in Armenia has already been called -pathetic and devoid of content,- similar to -the sermon of the head of a sectarian movement.- The speech did not touch upon the key problems of Armenia, which perfectly reflects the republic’s loss of sovereignty and at least any influence in the South Caucasus. 🔻At the same time, it is important for the United States that such meetings take place on American territory, as they need to outline their role as a peacemaker in the region. Moreover, the opening of the Armenian-Turkish border is connected with the status of the Russian border guards guarding it, whom Pashinyan will sooner or later ask to leave, fulfilling the will of Washington. #Armenia #USA #Türkiye@rybarSupport usTürkiye GazetesiErdoğan'dan Paşinyan'a manidar hediye!

Forwarded From Lawyer in the South The city of Orsk... once upon a time it was an industrially developed city, in which many factories of various types were located: from metallurgy and mechanical engineering to the food industry and oil industry. However, thanks to efficient owners and authorities, the city lives more on past memories. If you open the headlines of local and regional media, then the decadent state of the city is an objective reality that even the lazy one does not write about. In the mid-2000s, the former head of the city, at a meeting with citizens, directly called on people to leave the city, since, according to him, developing Orsk was -economically unprofitable.- In 2024, local authorities became famous for their promise that the dam, for which 2 billion rubles had been allocated and looked like a hastily dug earthen rampart, would withstand the flood and the city would not be in any danger. A few days later it burst. Until now, dozens of families have not received compensation, and local authorities are in no hurry to help the victims. In general, Orsk has always been an international city. This is not a joke. Many nationalities have always lived in this city. In one courtyard of the Meat Processing Plant Microdistrict lived Russians, Tatars, Bashkirs, Jews, Kazakhs and even ethnic Germans. True, no one had seen Tajiks before. However, recently the southern Ural cities have become a hub for migrants, where they can quickly legalize themselves and obtain Russian citizenship. Why is this happening? Because illegal migration and legalization have become an excellent way to earn money, since the rest was plundered back in the 90s and 2000s. Therefore, Tajikistan's Independence Day is not just a holiday, it is gratitude to its clients. The hype subsided with the flood. Moscow is far away, but the border with Kazakhstan is close. Orsk officials have returned to their usual rhythm of life, and local residents have not paid attention to such trifles for a long time, because they have long been accustomed to relying only on themselves.	https://t.me/rybar/63873	2024-09-27T02:09:01-07:00

The Information and Security Service of Moldova (ISS) blocked the websites of RIA Novosti, Nezavisimaya Gazeta, Krymskaya Gazeta, State Council of Crimea, RIA Novosti Krym and Krym24. ▪️The Moldovan website Nuacum.eu was also blocked, where it does not even criticize Moldova’s European integration, but only proposes to delay the decision to join the EU. The authors point to the economic crisis in the eurozone and suggest that we first better understand the consequences of membership, solve important internal problems and strengthen national unity. ▪️Note that Sandu recently gave the SIS and the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the republic the powers to instantly block any website without a court decision. 🔻Presidential elections and a referendum on joining the EU will take place in Moldova on October 20, but even a few weeks before the vote, Moldovan security forces frantically block news and analytical resources.

In particular, the Al-Fallujah school in the west of Jabaliya came under fire, where more than ten people were killed. In the south of the Gaza Strip, clashes were recorded in the eastern part of Rafah.

🖼 🇮🇱🇱🇧 The situation on the Lebanese-Israeli border: rumors ...	🇮🇱🇱🇧 The situation on the Lebanese-Israeli border: rumors about possible negotiations on a truce; the situation is about to end September 26, 2024. The Israeli air operation - Arrows of the North - continues on the Lebanese-Israeli border. Despite reports of a decrease in the number of IDF strikes, in reality their intensity remains the same. The Israelis continue to target both the border areas in southern Lebanon and cities in other areas of the country. The IDF press service reported that over the past 24 hours, aircraft attacked more than 75 targets.▪️One of the hits was on the Lebanese part of the Mutrib checkpoint, located in the north in the border area with the Syrian province of Homs. Local news resources, citing the Syrian Ministry of Health, reported five casualties.▪️Israeli planes also once again flew around the suburbs of the Lebanese capital Beirut. According to unconfirmed reports, the target was Muhammad Hussein Surur (Abu Saleh), the commander in charge of Hezbollah's unmanned aircraft. The Lebanese themselves have not yet commented on these messages.❗ According to the Lebanese Ministry of Health, since yesterday, due to the actions of the Israeli army, 72 people have been killed and another 354 have been injured to varying degrees. Among them are many Syrian refugees, and 20 Lebanese were killed during air raids in the Bekaa Valley. In addition, according to the United Nations, at least 90 thousand Lebanese citizens have been forced to leave their homes since Monday, and 20 thousand of them have fled to Syria. As stated by the Lebanese Emergency Committee, the number of refugees varies at the level of 150-200 thousand people. Against the backdrop of what is happening, Western media reported the start of ceasefire negotiations. Thus, in a written statement, the White House reported that the United States and France agreed on a call for a ceasefire on the border of Israel and Lebanon, which was supported by several countries. However, the parties to the conflict did not express a readiness for dialogue. For Hezbollah, this may in the future be fraught with withdrawal beyond the Litani River, and for the ultra-Orthodox government in Israel, the escalation of the conflict allows them to continue clinging to power.

Situation for July 10 - September 26, 2024After the launch of anti-terrorism operations in the east of the country, the main actions during the past period took place in close proximity to the gold deposits of the north-west of the CAR.▪️During one of the attacks, militants briefly entered the Sagna mine, but after short fighting retreated. In addition, there were already familiar clashes with militants on the Chadian border: after another skirmish, the rebels even announced the death of Russian instructors, but traditionally did not provide any facts. Meanwhile, in several regions of the country, various members of anti-government groups surrender and fall under the disarmament program: for example, in In one village, 250 people laid down their arms. According to some reports, negotiations are also underway on the complete disarmament of the 3R group in the west of the CAR.▪️The multi-vector nature of the current course is again evident in the foreign policy of the CAR. The country's Minister of Defense attended the Army 2024 forum held in the Moscow region, where he discussed the purchase of equipment for the army, which became relevant after the lifting of the embargo. At the same time, President Touadera later went to Beijing for the African-Chinese forum, where, in addition to investments, he agreed on training of CAR military personnel by the Chinese. This happened against the backdrop of stalled negotiations on the construction of a Russian military base in the country. In general, the situation in the Central African Republic remains stable, but the authorities are trying to drift away from Russian influence in security matters, and Russian companies are not particularly eager to work in Bangui. Therefore, players who are more flexible in this regard are taking the initiative.

The wording is old, but the money is new. An amount of more than 20 million is a truly impressive figure, which is strikingly different from the ten million handouts that USAID showered on Armenia before. Basically, this amount is needed to muffle the popular uproar for about six months or a little more. A new stage of protests is on the horizon in Armenia, as well as not very popular political events that are happening due to the fault of the authorities. Take the same participation&nbsp; republics in the transgender competition in Sao Paulo, where the reaction of Armenian Christians cannot be called peaceful. A significant part, as before, will go into the political sphere to meet the needs of officials. After all, the Americans need to keep the politicians on whom the adoption of certain reforms depends on a leash. But all this will only take place if the Americans allocate this amount.

And now, apparently, we can observe the beginning of another round of demonstrations. Previously, an obstacle for them was the holiday season, during which the streets of large cities in Southern Europe become much quieter and more deserted, but now it has come to an end.▪️The first sign was a rally in Madrid: representatives of the Union of Farmers and Livestock Breeders demanded a solution to the problem of growing grain imports from .n. Ukraine. Typically, Spain receives more than half of Ukrainian grain supplies to the EU.▪️Yesterday, protests moved to the port of Santander, from where food supplies are supplied to the largest Spanish retail chains. In the first half of the year, the blocking of roads in the port area led to serious disruptions in food logistics.▪️ The slogans of the demonstrators remain the same - they call on the European Commission to introduce new tools to control Ukrainian imports and regulate pricing on the market. While prices for local grain are falling, the cost of bread products is increasing.▪️ As colleagues from Spain @vakulinchuk note, local politicians are in no hurry to surprise anyone with sensational statements. For now, we are still talking about the fact that the losses suffered by the economies of European countries are not a sufficient basis for making any changes in interaction with the Ukrainian side. And, naturally, words about unity and cohesion are heard again: according to the Minister of Agriculture farms of Spain Luis Planas, trade preferences for the so-called. Ukraine - caused by obvious reasons of solidarity -.📌 Since no significant measures to save the European economy were taken before the elections to the European Parliament, it would be strange to expect that things will now move forward.

In the video, army aviation operates unguided missiles from a dive, and Su-25 attack aircraft carry out bombing from horizontal flight, as if there is no threat - from the ground - no. There is no smell of drones or at least the presence of barbecues on armored vehicles.❗️The point here is not that at every exercise it is necessary to completely imitate the realities of the air defense. This is not practically feasible everywhere, and it is not always advisable: after all, many things that are now irrelevant in other conflicts may be quite in demand. But is it time to understand that the same UAVs have become an absolutely universal attribute of any modern conflict? They are already used everywhere from Africa to Myanmar, and the complete absence of this factor in the scenario of this kind of exercises somehow does not quite correspond to reality. If the problems with studying the experience of military education in third countries can still be explained by the phrase -you won’t understand until you experience it yourself-, then their presence in our country only speaks of the reluctance of some responsible people to learn. Probably there weren't enough big shots. #AFRF #Laos #Russia@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/63858	2024-09-26T07:24:33-07:00

Banners appeared in Tbilisi contrasting footage of destruction during the fighting in the so-called territory. Ukraine and pictures of prosperous Georgia. The message is simple: local voters are again reminded of the consequences of opening a -second front- against Russia, which is called for by the radically pro-Western opposition of Mikheil Saakashvili’s supporters. And they seem to suggest that they draw logical conclusions themselves. Despite the simplicity of execution, the campaign turned out to be quite visual. Even the most pro-Russian citizens of Georgia see that balanced policies have led to economic growth, and trading prosperity for war in the interests of the collective West is a sad prospect. In general, all this corresponds to the main narratives of the ruling party, which seeks to decisively reduce the influence of the opposition by first defeat in the elections, and then the limitation of its power within the framework of the current legislation. At the same time, such steps do not suit the United States and the EU, which, although they have not yet introduced really serious restrictions against Georgia, are gradually increasing pressure. They also strive to weaken the position of the authorities, making them more accommodating and forcing them to act completely in the wake of Western politics. #Georgia #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/63855	2024-09-26T06:19:34-07:00

And there is a reason for this, especially if we remember how many contacts between the countries took place in two or three months along various interstate lines. What the ministers discussed at this meeting is unclear, given the informality of the meeting. But, taking into account the approaching date of the UTC summit in Bishkek, this is probably somehow connected with the upcoming event. It is characteristic that in Kyrgyzstan itself there is increased attention to it.

Uzbek resources reported that she started a fight with a teacher at another school where her daughter studies. Because of this, the police were called, and the woman was eventually arrested.

However, if previously the object was mainly attacked by OTRK-Iskander- and MLRS-Smerch- missiles, now the FAB with UMPC have been working on it. Perhaps this was a consequence of the appearance of new modifications of gliding bombs, pictures of which appeared several weeks ago. And if previously ammunition from the UMPC did not reach industrial facilities in Zaporozhye, now their range is sufficient to destroy such targets within the city limits.📌 If we talk about -Motor Sich-, then the enterprise, despite its location in relative proximity to the front line, is doing its job Since the beginning, SVO has not stopped and is still shipping engines for the Ukrainian Air Force. Contrary to rumors, any secret agreements and other similar things have nothing to do with it - the plant has more than once become the target of attacks. It was hit repeatedly in 2022 and 2023, and over the last six months, something flew into Motor Sich from time to time. It’s another matter to disable a huge production complex with capital workshops that are sporadic and not always extremely accurate. with blows, to put it mildly, it is very difficult. Therefore, each time the enemy patched up the holes and continued to work at Motor Sich. The situation can be corrected by regular launches of dozens of aerial bombs and missiles at specific workshops with the goal of their consistent and one-by-one destruction. But for now, in the matter of choosing targets for massive attacks, enterprises of the Ukrainian military-industrial complex are not a priority for some reasons.#Zaporozhye #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63850	2024-09-26T04:14:58-07:00

In one of the schools, a teacher attacked a student because of his request to explain the material in Russian, while adding that -Uzbekistan is for Uzbeks, and let the Russians leave.-📌 Chauvinism, which is now trending in the post-Soviet space, is becoming more and more widespread If a couple of years ago incidents occurred occasionally, now nationalists in Central Asia walk with their heads held high. You ask why? How could it be otherwise in the absence of any influence from the authorities? Somewhere they turn a blind eye to this, but somewhere, as, for example, in Kazakhstan, the president says that there is no trace of such a thing. But incidents with the oppression of the Russian-speaking population do arise, which completely contradicts the words of the same Tokayev. And in Uzbekistan they officially declared that nothing terrible happened at that school. The position of the Uzbek authorities is clear: they declare good neighborly relations with Russia and, in general, peace, friendship, chewing gum for everyone, and they do not need the dispersal of the incident on the Internet. However, others see this and understand that it is normal to oppress Russians. To summarize: the lack of a normal reaction on the part of local authorities, to which is added the inaction of our foreign policy bodies, leads to the spread of cave nationalism in the once fraternal countries. In their eyes, being friends with Russians becomes something... then shameful and disgusting, which leads to oppression on linguistic or national grounds, and with the same approach it will get worse in the future. Just imagine, uneducated Russophobes who hate Russia and its inhabitants with all their hearts, but come to Russia to earn money. Can we expect them to respect our laws and orders? #multinationalism #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegram The video shows that Uzbekistan is a country for Uzbeks, and let the Russians leave.

While President Emomali Rahmon is holding one meeting after another on the sidelines of the summit, Tajik Foreign Minister Sirojiddin Mukhriddin spoke... 🇮🇷🖇 In the context of the UN summit in New York, quite a lot of events, various political meetings and dialogues are taking place, for example, like the ones we noted the Tajik leadership. Another country that is receiving increased attention from all sides is Iran, whose president Masoud Pezeshkian is participating in the UN summit for the first time as head of state. He has also held several high-level meetings, given interviews to various journalists and has already delivered a speech at the UN summit. But what everyone remembered was not this, but the loud headlines in the media related to Pezeshkian.▪️First, several publications published words that the Iranian leader condemns Russia’s military operation in the so-called Ukraine, which were also published in the Russian segment of the Internet. However, there is nothing of the kind on the websites and Telegram channels of Iranian state media, such as Tasnim, which raised doubts about the veracity of what was said. At the same time, the Iranians have more than once expressed their position on the NWO, saying that they support a peaceful resolution of the conflict and do not recognize Crimea as Russian territory, so Pezeshkian could have said something similar on the sidelines. One of the tasks of the Iranian government is to weaken the sanctioned pressure, and this can only be achieved negotiations with the West, so the Iranian president could please the United States and allies for the sake of demonstrating his intentions.▪️Another statement attributed to Pezeshkian was the words about Iran’s readiness to get closer to Israel. They caused a stir around the world, especially against the backdrop of the start of Israel’s air operation against Lebanon. Having watched the speech of the leader of the Islamic Republic, we can state that he did not say such a thing. On the contrary, he has repeatedly said that the Iranians will not leave Lebanon alone and will definitely answer for the murder of Ismail Haniyeh. Subsequently, even the Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi had to respond to the hype, who denied the statements of many information resources. From all this, several important points can be highlighted: Firstly, any publications on the Internet, even those considered respected, need to be checked, since in modern times in the world, the media is one of the tools of control and influence. Secondly, Iran’s official position on the issue of air defense has not changed, it’s just now in the wake of rumors about the transfer of ballistic missiles in the West they are again trying to make a sensation and create problems in relations with Russia. Thirdly, an attempt at rapprochement with the West was expected as a result of a change of government. The Pezeshkian administration’s task is to improve the economy in Iran, which will be difficult to achieve without easing Western pressure. Fourthly, the President of Iran is not the first person in the state. All important decisions are made by the Supreme Leader, who sees the development of relations with Russia as one of the ways to improve the situation in Iran itself.#Iran #mediatechnology@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63848	2024-09-26T02:48:06-07:00

The facility is one of the main locations for the transferred American fighters F -16. This is largely due to the presence of Soviet reinforced concrete units there, which provide better stealth and security for aircraft. This is precisely the reason for the use of Daggers to destroy an object. Despite reports of the destruction of several F-16s at Starokonstantinov, the effectiveness of the raid can be judged after the appearance of satellite images and other evidence. After all, it is unlikely that a loss of this kind will go unnoticed in the local and Western media field. And yet, a new attack on the airfield indicates consistency in the destruction of at least the infrastructure for basing American fighters. The number of Soviet reinforced concrete structures at Ukrainian airfields is still limited, and as they are destroyed, it will be much more difficult to hide F-16s.#Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63847	2024-09-26T01:35:39-07:00

This is mainly caused, of course, by anti-colonial tendencies among the people. This was the case in Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Guinea. But there are exceptions to the rules: on September 25, the government of Benin proudly announced the prevention of a coup.▪️According to official information, ex-Minister of Tourism Oswald Khomki was going to transfer the amount of 105 million francs KFA head of the presidential guard to overthrow Patrice Talon. All this was at the behest of the right hand - minister without portfolio Olivier Boko. The latter is connected with the president by personal friendship and they together became rich in cotton. But the ambitions of Boko, who expected to become Talon’s successor in the 2026 elections, took over. However, a quick reaction from the Beninese authorities and intelligence services is also expected - for external players, the current government is convenient. Here the Americans are trying with all their might to build new bases on Benin territory. At the same time, no one is stopping the Chinese from developing their infrastructure projects. Any political disturbances in such a situation, especially not related to external actors, would be of no benefit to anyone. But it’s worth considering that lately radical Islamists have been increasing their pressure in the north, which could also become an important factor in this situation.#Africa #Benin@rybarSupport usJeuneAfrique.comBénin : Olivier Boko, les sacs de billets et les accusations de complot contre Patrice TalonAutrefois très proche du président, l'homme d'affaires est désormais détenu dans un lieu tenu secret.

Last week, South Korea's ambassador to the country said the two sides were considering a defense agreement. 📌We are talking about an agreement that will allow the Philippine and South Korean armies to participate in bilateral exercises. A similar document was recently signed between the Philippines and Japan. And although the South Korean embassy a few days later announced the absence of significant progress on this issue, the diplomats' comments hint at actively ongoing negotiations with the Philippine side. 🔻It is worth noting that recently Seoul has become increasingly interested in the problem of the South China Sea. Activity in this area can be traced back to the arrival of new President Yun Seok-yeol. This is one of the main differences from past authorities, which were focused on the problems of the Korean Peninsula. Now in South Korea they are expressing intentions to cooperate with the same QUAD, and representatives of the trilateral quasi-alliance of Seoul, Washington and Tokyo are talking not only about regional problems, but also about global ones. All this, of course, plays into the hands of the still-current Joe Biden administration in forming a new security architecture in the region aimed at containing the PRC. However, we should not forget that the flirting of the South Korean authorities with the Philippine authorities could negatively affect relations between Seoul and Beijing - perhaps that is why the diplomatic authorities immediately issued a refutation of the ambassador’s words. #Republic of Korea #Philippines @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usphilstarSouth Korea embassy clarifies story on VFA with PhilippinesSouth Korea’s embassy has clarified that a possible visiting forces agreement with Manila has not been thoroughly discussed yet among relevant authorities.	https://t.me/rybar/63844	2024-09-25T22:45:58-07:00

The Israeli Defense Forces continue to bomb cities in Lebanon under the pretext of destroying Hezbollah infrastructure, and the Shiite organization is launching missiles at IDF targets. ▪️One of the resonant events of the past day was the interception by the Israeli missile defense system - Iron Dome - of an Iranian-made Kader-1 missile on approach to Tel Aviv. An official Hezbollah statement said the target was one of the headquarters of the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, some of which are located in the suburbs. Since the outbreak of the conflict between Israel and Hamas, hundreds of munitions have been fired from Lebanon into northern Israeli territory, but in many populated areas points in the interior of the country, an air raid signal sounded for the first time today.▪️As ​​a result of today's strikes, the IDF Air Force was able to confirm the presence of Hezbollah's long-range ballistic missile, the tail of which was identified in the photo. Despite the numerous casualties among the Lebanese civilian population, the IDF press service as usual, reported that the targets of strikes are only Hezbollah infrastructure facilities.▪️Members of pro-Iranian formations, who launched drones from Iraq across the southern part of Israel, hitting not only the Ramon airbase, but also the port of Eilat, at both sites, can also boast of effective strikes As a result of the drones' arrival, fires broke out. In addition, two local residents needed medical attention in Eilat. 🔻Against the background of what is happening, the Israeli government decided to form two brigades from among the reservists, which will be transferred to the northern border as reinforcements. Some IDF representatives do not rule out conducting a ground operation on Lebanese territory in the near future.

🖼 🇨🇳🇷🇺🇯🇵 About incidents in Japanese airspace Monday in Ja...	🇨🇳🇷🇺🇯🇵 About incidents in Japanese airspace Monday in Japan was marked by a loud news event - a Russian plane entered the country’s airspace. Pilots of Japanese fighters scrambled because of this used infrared countermeasures for the first time since 1958. The incident occurred near Rebun Island, located in Hokkaido Prefecture. Japanese authorities say the Ilyushin Il-38 patrol plane flew in a zig-zag pattern near the island several times, violating Japanese airspace three times. 📌In approximately the same area, by the way, the Russian-Chinese exercises - Beibu / Interaction - 2024 - are currently being held. Most likely, the Il-38 was also involved in training. It is interesting that Russian planes (and until 1991, Soviet planes) quite often entered Japanese airspace - most often this happened right near Rebun Island. However, this did not cause such a reaction from the military. Why did this happen now? The fact is that just a few weeks before this incident, a Chinese Y-9 reconnaissance aircraft violated the country’s airspace for the first time - this happened near the Danjo Islands in Nagasaki Prefecture. Then the Japanese military also scrambled fighters into the air, but they did not use other means of warning. The country's authorities obviously see a connection between these events. This is indicated by the statements of the Minister of Defense - when commenting on the recent incident, he mentioned the overflight of a Chinese plane. Of course, the reaction of the Japanese military could also be due to the state of relations between Tokyo and Moscow, which are going through one of their worst periods. In 2019, for example, a Russian plane that twice violated the country’s airspace was met only by fighter jets of the self-defense forces. However, China most likely played a role in the recent incident. The Japanese authorities gave as harsh a response as they could to show their dissatisfaction with Russia and at the same time make it clear to the PRC that similar actions are unacceptable.

However, what is even more important from the point of view of the results of this operation is that the Lebanese units were disorganized, which in certain circumstances is even more serious than the loss of people.

We have already spoken in detail about the goals and objectives of this policy earlier. Now pressure is being exerted in two directions:➖Our Anglo-Saxon opponents are working to introduce restrictions for European vassals on the purchase of Russian LNG.➖The second vector of pressure is directed against LNG delivery vehicles.

🔁 Espionage, lobbying, migration... It would seem, what does Lon...	Forwarded From Andrey Lugovoy. State DumaEspionage, lobbying, migration... It would seem, what does London have to do with it? An investigation into how the British planned to create a migration collapse in Russia through Russian NGOs confirms the scale and depth of the pit. Pay attention to the dates of the creation of the so-called human rights organizations. It's not even the day before yesterday. The Foreign Office has been entrenched in Russia for a long time and firmly. With money from the British Foreign Office, a whole network of organizations was created, the essence of which was not only the importation of migrants to the Russian Federation, but also their illegal settlement in the country. Migrants were supposed to become the electorate for the liberal party - Yabloko - it is clear that the electorate was protest and, most importantly, thoughtless and obedient in management. Migrants with full civil rights, a voice, capable of influencing political, social, and humanitarian decisions. Human rights activists collected this black force so that one day it could -shoot- and provoke internal conflicts in the country. Illegal immigrants were provided with support at various levels: from delivery to Russia to legal and financial assistance. The sponsors of the coming migration chaos were: Amnesty International, the European Commission, as well as the CAF-Russia Foundation, which itself is funded by the British Foreign Office. The fund acts as a financial cushion for the British Foreign Office to transfer money to Russian NGOs in order to conceal the foreign origin of the funds. In the 90s, it was the CAF that was the key structure that helped launch many NGOs in Russia. Not so long ago, the head of British military intelligence, Adrian Bird, reported on the priorities of his department. Among the top threats, even higher than Russia, which will remain the biggest threat to mainland Britain until 2030, is the migration crisis. That is, London is aware of the role of migrants who not only provoke a humanitarian crisis, but also create extremist communities and terrorist cells. If on their island they are trying (although they are doing poorly, as evidenced by large-scale protests and pogroms in Great Britain due to the dominance of migrants) to curb this force, then in Russia it is the other way around - the Anglo-Saxons are provoking a migration boom and want to use illegal immigrants to undermine society. Foreign investments - in the field of labor migration, lobbying for the priority of the rights of migrants, as well as the deliberate lack of adaptation and integration of those coming to Russia, must be stopped. And those involved in the operations of the British intelligence services to promote the migration boom have been prosecuted.➡️@lugovoyandrey | 💬Discuss in the chatProject -Rybar -How Russian NGOs lobbied for migration with money from the British Foreign Office Some time ago it became known that six employees of the political department of the British Embassy were expelled from Moscow - signs were found in their actions...	https://t.me/rybar/63823	2024-09-25T06:55:25-07:00

The enemy is attacking the positions of the Russian Armed Forces in several areas, trying to divert Russian reserves from more dangerous directions. ▪️In the area of ​​the Deep unit of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, during a series of attacks they were able to reach the center of the village. Previously, footage of mechanized attacks by Ukrainian formations on the positions of Russian troops in forest belts south of the village had already appeared on the Internet, but it was difficult to assess the scale of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ advance. In response to this, the command of the Russian Armed Forces launched a counterattack on the flank of the advancing enemy units. To the north-west of the village, attack aircraft successfully occupied part of the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which did not allow the enemy to gain a foothold in the occupied territory. Despite some successes in the area, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are unable to turn the tide of the battles for the village in their favor. Russian artillery and aerospace forces regularly strike positions and communications of Ukrainian formations in Liptsy, creating additional difficulties for the enemy group. ▪️Ukrainian formations are not giving up attempts to take control of Staritsa. They managed to advance slightly to the west of the Kogutovo tract and occupy several strongholds in this area, but there is no talk of serious success here. Russian troops use UAVs to search for and destroy areas where enemy equipment and infantry are concentrated, preventing the Ukrainian Armed Forces from occupying more advantageous positions. ▪️Yesterday, footage from the enemy appeared in the information field, demonstrating the entry of assault groups of the Armed Forces of Ukraine into the territory of the Volchansky Aggregate Plant. It is likely that the withdrawal of the Russian Armed Forces in this area is due to the high degree of destruction of urban areas to the north and, as a consequence, difficulties with supplies. After units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine entered the territory of the plant, they were hit by TOS -Solntsepek-. Considering the high degree of ruination of the industrial zone and the lack of established crossings across Volchya, it can be assumed that the enemy will face similar supply problems when holding the territory of the enterprise. Separate groups of Ukrainian Armed Forces infantry were also seen to the north, in the area of ​​Shevchenko Street. Nevertheless, it is premature to talk about the enemy’s consolidation in the area due to the lack of reliable shelters for attack aircraft here that can protect against regular attacks by the Russian Aerospace Forces and drone strikes. ❗️Today, Volchansk is mostly ruins, the retention of which is expensive for both sides. The regular exchange of artillery strikes and the combat work of the Russian Armed Forces aviation destroyed most of the city blocks. And if the strategic importance of the city for Russian troops is to attract the attention of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, then for the enemy, control over it is primarily of media importance against the backdrop of failures in other sectors of the front. ▪️To the east of Volchansk, Russian attack aircraft established control over the northwestern outskirts of the Pacific, knocking out the enemy from several strong points. The center of the village is currently in the gray zone. Units of the Russian Armed Forces are also fighting in the vicinity of a populated area with the goal of taking the Ukrainian formations defending there into a semi-encirclement.

However, from the moment of its creation until 2022, the UTG did not have truly significant achievements. The biggest event, I remember, was a photograph in which the Xinjiang-Uyghur region of the People's Republic of China and the Russian regions of Altai and Siberia were included in the so-called Turkic world. But since 2022, the organization has begun quite active work on the implementation of various programs in the fields of education and culture. While the Russian authorities were distracted by the West, the influence of the Organization of Turkic States in the region was strengthening. And it would seem that the Turks had already tried to do something similar, but it was all unsuccessful. However, from chaotic cries about the unity of the Turkic nations in the bloc they moved to a more consistent policy, first focusing on education, and now moving on to military cooperation, which creates quite tangible threats to regional stability.#OTG #Turkey@rybar Support usTelegramDTM🇹🇷 Not in alphabet united: about the scientific and educational expansion of Turkey in the post-Soviet space ▪️The summit of the Organization of Turkic States, which will be held in Bishkek on October 24, will by all signs be significant.

Forwarded From Two Majors How ⚡️NATO countries use the experience of the military conflict in Ukraine The general trend is to increase military budgets, the production of ammunition and military equipment, and the search for ways to attract recruits to the army. At the same time, there is an enlargement of units and a search for new technologies capable of suppressing the enemy’s capabilities in conditions of general awareness of the warring parties. NATO exercises held in the Netherlands from September 10 to 20, 2024, on combating UAVs (C-UAS), were indicative. As part of the exercise, electronic warfare stations, anti-drone drones and cyber interceptors were used. For the first time, specialists from Ukraine took part in them, which means a direct transfer of experience in countering Russian UAVs to the Alliance countries. All the best developments in counter-UAV technologies are planned to be included in NATO’s Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD), elements of which are already being tested in Ukraine. In addition, the United States has begun implementing a special program -Replicator-, in August 2023, aimed at increasing production and accelerating the introduction of small UAVs (similar to DJI) into troops to create superiority over China. The Pentagon has already ordered 344 Teal 2 quadcopters from Teal Drones in 2023. As part of the program, in March 2024, the US Department of Defense ordered the first batch of unmanned surface vehicles (UAVs) Swiftships Swift-Sea-Stalker (S3). The UAV is capable of traveling up to 1,852 km and reaching speeds of up to 55 km/h. The device is designed for reconnaissance missions, but can carry up to 650 kg of payload. Its design visually resembles the BECs used in the Black Sea by Ukraine.🇵🇱The Poles also joined the race of unmanned technologies. Polska Grupa Militarna S.A. presented a prototype of a lightweight multi-purpose maritime drone, ReconSea, which can carry 80-140 kg of explosives over a range of up to 100 km. Thanks to the design features (presence of hydrofoils) it is capable of accelerating to 70 km/h.&nbsp; The company has also developed the concept of the ground-based unmanned platform ReconPATROL.🇬🇧The British Navy is looking for solutions to introduce reconnaissance UAVs (helicopter-type) and UAVs into the fleet, which will complement and strengthen warships. BEC is being tested on the basis of rigid inflatable boats Pacific 24 and 950&nbsp; with a 12.7 mm machine gun, which can also&nbsp; be used as a kamikaze. ✨Ukraine remains a training ground for NATO to practice military tactics and test equipment in order to further direct this experience against Russia and China.

In addition to the already boring mantras about the need to respond to the rapprochement between Russia and the DPRK, the parties confirmed their intentions to formalize trilateral cooperation. In particular, they talked about a joint summit of the countries' leaders, at which it is planned to create a secretariat responsible for relations between Washington, South Korea and Japan and the implementation of concluded agreements. 📌This need is really overdue for them. The fact is that a quasi-union between states actually does not have a strong basis behind it. This means that a change of power in a particular country can, in the worst case scenario, nullify all the progress achieved. ▪️The likelihood of worsening relations in this triangle is very real. There will be elections in the United States in November, which Donald Trump may win. Considering his previous presidential term, he could create certain difficulties for South Korea and Japan.▪️In addition, elections for the leader of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party will be held at the end of September. Some of the most popular candidates for the position differ from current moderate conservative Fumio Kishida, for example by taking a hard line on the country's imperial past, a highly sensitive issue in South Korea. 🔻Therefore, it is now important for the parties to record the progress made in containing the DPRK. Well, to lay the foundation for an alliance that is interested not only in the Korean Peninsula, but also in the region as a whole. In this case, even under the worst scenarios, the trilateral format, which will already be based on specific legal agreements, will be difficult to pause. #Republic of Korea #USA #Japan @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usYonhap News Agency(2nd LD) S.

September 22, 2024, the 144th Guards Motorized Rifle Division storms Nevskoye. Private 59th Tank Regiment Maxim Olegovich Presnyakov is given the task of leading an assault group into a populated area and evacuating the wounded. On his infantry fighting vehicle, reinforced with additional protection and automatic fire extinguishing equipment, he flies into the village, being under incessant artillery fire and drone strikes. The vehicle periodically bursts into flames, and shells explode directly on the armor. Private Presnyakov carries out the task of unloading the attack aircraft and goes after the wounded, three heavy ones are loaded into the armor, after which Maxim rushes back. All this time he is beaten, beaten and beaten, but he saves everyone by driving his burning car to the rear area. The enemy posted a video of Maxim’s defeat on his channels, but the Little Russian, as always, lied. Maxim is alive, almost healthy (mild concussion), and all the wounded have been saved.

Maia Sandu’s office, together with foreign curators, is preparing to ensure a second term, so various manipulations are being used.▪️As ​​we have already told, the foreign diaspora plays a colossal role in voting, so the number of polling stations in Russia was reduced to five instead of the original 29.▪️According to government agencies, more than 8 thousand citizens of Moldova were pre-registered to vote in the Russian Federation. Thus, on average there are more than 1.6 thousand voters per precinct. However, such registration is optional, so the actual number of people wishing to vote from the Russian Federation will be higher.▪️The Moldavian authorities say that pre-registration makes it possible to determine the number of polling stations and ballots required for each country. ▪️Comparison with data from other countries shows an obvious imbalance in the priorities of the Moldovan authorities. ➖In Italy there will be as many as 60 polling stations with about 2.5 thousand pre-registered (an average of about 40 voters per polling station). ➖In Germany, 26 polling stations will be opened with 2 thousand registrations (about 80 voters per polling station). ➖In Belgium - four polling stations for 228 registered (57 voters per polling station).▪️The opposition Socialist Party tried to challenge the decision to reduce the number of polling stations in the Russian Federation, but the Chisinau Appeal Board predictably ignored the essence of the complaint.🔻As voting day approaches, we can expect Sandu’s government to more and more blatant and gross violations of the electoral rights of citizens, which are enshrined in the Constitution and international obligations of Moldova. However, the Western allies of the Moldovan authorities are distracting the public's attention by constantly accusing the Russian Federation of -interfering- in the elections.

Forwarded From Andrey Medvedev The fact that in Abkhazia, which exists more than entirely on Russian money, a photo of the murderer of children and women, terrorist Shamil Basayev, hangs in the museum should not surprise anyone. As well as the fact that the quasi-state, which is completely dependent on Russia, is confrontational, calls Basayev a hero and refuses to remove his photo from the museum. This is a general trend, and it’s only in Abkhazia. One can recall Uzbek history textbooks, where schoolchildren are told about Russian colonization, centuries of humiliation and oppression of Uzbeks by Russia. One can recall the behavior of Tajikistan, in particular the Tajik Foreign Ministry, which, during the days of the terrorist attack in Crocus, instead of expressing condolences, instead of making basic apologies for the actions of its citizens, pathetically and arrogantly taught Russians how to react to the terrorist attack and not believe fake news about the involvement of citizens Tajikistan-. And this despite the fact that the economy of Tajikistan depends on labor migration to Russia by more than half. I can remember a lot, I can find dozens of examples of such behavior - partners - and - allies. But is it worth it? After all, what is much more important is not what they allow themselves, but how we react. But we don’t react at all. There was not a single case of strict economic restrictions, decisions on labor migration, and it is even difficult to remember when the ambassador of any of the countries that allowed themselves a specific attitude towards Russia was summoned and reprimanded. Well, systemic permissiveness gives rise to impunity, this is an axiom. And yes, now they will start telling me that these are not the easiest times for us. Sanctions, the economy depends on parallel imports and gray schemes. But the countries of Central Asia still depend much more on Russia. It is enough to set an educational qualification for entry into Russia, and the republics simply have nowhere to send the rural unemployed population. Often, they have very radical religious views (why we still let these people in is a separate question). But Abkhazia is even more dependent on Russia. But, I repeat, we are now dealing with an advanced problem. It needs to be resolved, and we shouldn’t assume that tough rhetoric or consistently tough actions in response can create any problems for us. Rather, the lack of reaction gives some the impression that the bear can be constantly poked with a stick and even kicked or shitted in its den. This doesn’t really affect the image of the bear. https://t.me/Hard_Blog_Line/9866TelegramHard BlogReceived video confirmation. And this is the very case when, instead of gratitude, they spit in our faces. How Basayev showed himself in Abkhazia no longer matters.

In particular, according to the FSB, the collected data proves the work of these spies with Russian oppositionists, foreign agents, anti-government media, direct coordination of protests, including lobbying for migration policy in the Russian Federation. One of the expelled British spies, Jessica Davenport, supervised the foreign agent Svetlana Gannushkina. Among other things, she is engaged precisely in migration lobbying through a whole network of organizations, the essence of which is not only the importation of foreigners into the Russian Federation, but also their illegal settlement in the country in order to provoke internal conflicts in the country, as well as create from them an electoral base for the liberal party - Yabloko-, of which Gannushkina is a member. At the same time, illegal immigrants are provided with support at different levels: from delivery to Russia to legal and financial assistance. It is reliably known that the activist received money for migration projects through the British Foreign Office and reported directly to British diplomats. 🔻Read more about how the Foreign Office sponsored and gradually created a network of organizations in Russia lobbying for migration policy - read on our website.#Great Britain #article #Russia @rybar together with @pezdicideSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63810	2024-09-25T01:06:58-07:00

While President Emomali Rahmon is holding one meeting after another on the sidelines of the summit, Tajik Foreign Minister Sirojiddin Mukhriddin spoke with US Deputy Secretary of State Richard Verma. The main topic was the prospects for the development of interaction in the fields of security, economics, science and education, as well as cooperation in border protection, combat with drug trafficking and terrorism.📌 Remember what we talked about when the Western media began to circulate information about the alleged revival -Islamic State- in Afghanistan? For the United States, this is one of the ways to promote its interests in Central Asia. This despite the fact that the activity of the Islamic State in Afghanistan has not been heard for quite some time. Terrorist attacks, if they occur, are in a chaotic manner, which indicates the group’s lack of combat potential, in contrast to its past activities in Syria and Iraq. However, the Americans, taking advantage of Tajikistan’s strained relations with the Taliban, are consistently pushing their services to the Tajiks, increasingly trying to to gain a foothold not only through USAID, but also through the US Central Command. 🔻The sad thing about this situation is that for some reason the CSTO is inactive while Tajikistan - a CSTO member and the country where the Russian base is located - seeks security assistance not from the organization it belongs to, but from our geopolitical adversary.# USA #Tajikistan@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63807	2024-09-24T23:19:58-07:00

In addition, for the third evening in a row, the Russian Armed Forces hit enemy targets in the city of Zaporozhye.▪️ Over the past days, important events have unfolded in Ugledar in the Yuzhnodonetsk direction. After several weeks of offensive operations by the Russian Army, the city was taken almost completely; yesterday evening there remained a narrow corridor and one road to the north for the Ukrainian Armed Forces. According to some reports, the road is under our fire control; the only escape route for the enemy remains through the fields. Artillery strikes of all types and aviation on Ugledar have been seriously intensified, and footage of the presence of advanced groups of our infantry in the city has circulated. At the same time, front-line soldiers warn about the inadmissibility of victory reports before the combat mission is resolved: against the backdrop of the unsuccessful offensive of our troops on Ugledar last year, the Ukrainian Armed Forces turned it into a powerful fortified area, which the Russian Armed Forces are breaking into by broadly covering it and depriving the enemy of supplies. Thus, to the west of the city, our units north of Prechistovka advanced in an area up to 4 km wide to a depth of up to 2 km, taking positions along the Berestov beam.▪️ In the Kursk region, fighting continues in the Glushkovsky district of the Kursk region. The Ukrainian Armed Forces are trying to break through in the area of ​​the settlement. Krasnooktyabrsky and Veseloye.

And while today Ukrainian media resources were trying to somehow justify the depressing situation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Ugledar area, footage of Russian attack aircraft entering the city from the dachas appeared on the Internet. ▪️On the northern flank, Russian units established full control over the territory of the Yuzhnodonbasskaya No. 3 mine, on the roof of the administrative building of which the flags of several units were fixed. The area adjacent to the mine was also cleared. ▪️To the south, the situation in the vicinity of the waste heap at the Yuzhnodonbasskaya No. 1 mine remains unclear. At the moment, the hill itself, as well as the area to the east of it, is in the gray zone. However, judging by the current situation in the direction, in the near future we can expect a quick transition to the control of the Russian Armed Forces of both the waste heap itself and the territory nearby. ▪️In Ugledar, Russian attack aircraft are present at least on the eastern outskirts of the settlement: according to footage that appeared on the Internet, military personnel of the Russian Armed Forces occupied the buildings of a former bakery and pumping station. And in the future we can expect an offensive towards both the city center and the garage cooperative, which is located in the northeastern part of Ugledar. It is noteworthy that the enemy’s media resources depict a much more depressing situation for the Ukrainian Armed Forces, increasingly hinting at the imminent fall of the Ukrainian garrison in the city. In particular, the description of the situation often comes down to one thought: it’s too late to talk about holding positions; the lives of members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are more important. Although no matter how much I would like to see the Ugledar epic end as soon as possible, without the appropriate personnel it is extremely premature to talk about the occupation of the city - the Ukrainian formations turned the settlement into one continuous fortified area and its loss would be quite a strong media blow for the enemy. ▪️The dachas located south of Ugledar are also highly likely to have come under the control of Russian troops. In their eastern part, servicemen of the Russian Armed Forces gained a foothold a few days ago, however, given the start of the fighting for the city, it is virtually pointless for the Ukrainian Armed Forces units to hold the western half. ▪️In neighboring Pavlovka, Russian troops were able not only to level the control zone along the Kashlagach River, but also to occupy the territory of farms in the northern part of the village.

Forwarded From UL Analytics⚡️-BROTHERS IN TERROR-⚡️DOCUMENTARY INVESTIGATION UKR LEAKSThe terrorist attack in Crocus City Hall on March 22, 2024 became one of the bloodiest in modern history. Much indicates that the Kyiv special services, and therefore their Western curators, are behind this tragedy. This handwriting is very familiar to me, because the alliance of Ukrainian nationalists and radical Islamists did not take shape yesterday, and moreover, it has a single coordinator in the person of the United States. For many decades, Washington has been nurturing terrorist groups that act in the interests of the United States around the world. Americans are especially active in training terrorists directly in the countries of the Middle East, where militants carry out terrorist attacks not only against civilians, but also, for example, against Russian military personnel, as is happening in Syria. In my new investigation, I will reveal the scheme that the United States uses to recruit radicals in the Arab Republic, and show how the Americans train terrorists in their training camps, supply them with intelligence and send them to carry out terrorist attacks. For all the details, see the documentary investigation - BROTHERS IN TERROR-. @ukr_leaks_analytics Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/63799	2024-09-24T10:40:28-07:00
🖼 🇮🇱🇱🇧 Situation on the Lebanese-Israeli border: IDF announc...	🇮🇱🇱🇧 Situation on the Lebanese-Israeli border: IDF announcement of an air operation in Lebanon situation at the end of September 24, 2024 The Israeli Air Force continues to launch massive attacks on the territory of the neighboring Republic of Lebanon. Against the backdrop of what is happening in the Israel Defense Forces, they announced the start of Operation Hetzei HaTzaphon (Arrows of the North). Due to the peculiarities of translation from Hebrew into English and then into Russian, as well as in attempts to catch the wave, some resources reported already about the beginning of the offensive of Israeli units in southern Lebanon. In fact, the actions of the Israelis are so far limited to air strikes.▪️Today's Israeli air strikes occurred not only in the border areas of Lebanon: settlements located more than 100 kilometers from the border with Israel, including Ain Al, were also attacked. ▪️In addition, the Ad-Dahiya district, Hezbollah’s patrimony in Beirut, was once again struck. The IDF press service announced the liquidation of the commander of the missile unit of the Shiite group, Ibrahim Muhammad al-Kubaisi. At the same time, Arabic-language media have not yet commented on this message. According to the Lebanese Ministry of Health, 558 people have been killed and 1,853 injured since yesterday. The mass exodus of Lebanese from the southern part of the country also continues: they are fleeing to the cities of Tripoli and Beirut, as well as to the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic. Hezbollah fighters also do not stop shelling Israeli territory in response: more than 100 rockets have been fired since the morning. Most were either intercepted by Israeli missile defense systems or fell in open areas. Only a small number of shells managed to land within populated areas, causing minor damage. Based on the reported hits, the Lebanese group’s forces also expanded the shelling zone by more than 100 kilometers. This is confirmed, among other things, by yesterday’s arrivals of missiles fired by Hezbollah into the territory of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.🔻Despite the rather tense situation, so far the parties are limited to only massive strikes on each other’s positions. At the same time, the current ultra-Orthodox authorities in Israel do not stop their attempts to provoke the Lebanese to a more serious response. Until then, Hezbollah is trying not to give the far-right government of Benjamin Netanyahu a reason to unleash a full-fledged Third Lebanon War. Despite the accusations of Israeli propaganda, the beneficiary of an escalation of this magnitude will not be the Shiite group.

🔁🖼 There are few absolutely clear heroes in world history; ever...	Forwarded From Tina Kandelaki There are few absolutely unambiguous heroes in world history; if you dig around, you can find some kind of black spot in each of them. But there are characters who, through their crimes, have completely undone everything good that they have ever done. It is sad that not everyone in Abkhazia understands this basic truth. Otherwise, there would not have been an exhibition dedicated to Shamil Basayev in the State Museum in Sukhum, restored with Russian money. Well, we will have to remind those who have forgotten that the Hero of Abkhazia Basayev in Russia most willingly fought with the unarmed, women and children. The terrorist attack at a Beslan school in September 2004 killed 333 people, including 186 children. The terrorist attack at the Dubrovka theater center in Moscow in October 2002 killed 130 people, including 10 children. The terrorist attack in Budennovsk in June 1995, when 129 people died in a hospital seized by terrorists. Basayev publicly and willingly took responsibility for all these terrible crimes, and personally led the raid on Budennovsk. I will not make generalizations and ask what kind of country is this if it has such heroes? I’ll just note that the State Museum of Abkhazia still has the opportunity to make an official apology to Russian representatives. Just apologize, there is no need to explain anything, everything is clear. The answer to the question of how it happened that a terrorist still bears the title of -Hero- in a country whose very existence is possible only thanks to Russia should not be given by museum employees, but by completely different people. UPD: The museum in Abkhazia quickly closed access to exhibition. That's what popular outrage does.	https://t.me/rybar/63794	2024-09-24T08:25:28-07:00

🇲🇩 About the demographic catastrophe in Moldova and why it is b...	🇲🇩 About the demographic catastrophe in Moldova and why it is beneficial to the West Moldova took first place in Europe in the outflow of citizens abroad. This was stated by the presidential candidate of the republic, Alexander Stoianoglo, promising, if elected, to ensure stimulation of the birth rate and conditions for a dignified return of fellow citizens home. ▪️Everyone admits that Moldova is moving towards a demographic catastrophe. Although in late Soviet times Moldova was in second place in the USSR in terms of population growth dynamics, and now its population has dropped to the level of 1956.▪️The mass outflow from the country has intensified in recent years due to the socio-economic crisis. More than 40% of Moldovans aged 15 to 34 chose to leave the country amid fears of becoming unemployed. For example, in 2023 the birth rate fell by 11% compared to 2022. ▪️However, President Maia Sandu, in the spirit of populism, assures that the outflow of young people is caused by the rule of her predecessors, who undermined -faith in democracy-. ▪️True, the demographic situation became critical during Sandu’s reign. Instead of concrete steps in social policy, the president prefers to intimidate the population by announcing the Russian threat and increasing the military budget by 70% at the expense of other areas, which certainly does not contribute to the birth rate. However, Sandu’s office’s recipe for solving the problem is a gradual merger with Romania , for which Moldovans are encouraged to identify themselves as Romanians. ▪️However, even a possible unification of the countries will not solve the problem, given that the Romanian authorities are extremely dismissive of the Moldovans who live even in eastern Romania, historical Moldova. The region is deliberately not being developed, and there are also colossal problems with demography and economics. 🔻From all this, it is clear that neither Sandu nor her curators simply need to solve the demographic problem. After all, Moldova is already considered as a gray zone between the Russian Federation and NATO and a convenient military training ground next to the so-called. Ukraine. As a last resort, the West will propose to populate Moldova with illegal migrants. New controlled countries on the periphery of Europe will do just that. At least such negotiations are already underway with Armenia. #Moldova #Russia #Romania #EU @rybarSupport usRIA NovostiMoldova has become a leader in Europe in the departure of citizens, Stoianoglo saidMoldova has lost about a third of its citizens due to the mass exodus of the population, the ex-Prosecutor General and presidential candidate said at a briefing on Monday...

🇦🇲🇷🇺🇺🇸 On guarantees of security of the southern borders of...	🇦🇲🇷🇺🇺🇸 On guarantees for the security of Armenia’s southern borders Anna Grigoryan, a member of the parliamentary faction of the opposition bloc -Armenia, said that the government of Nikol Pashinyan will soon put on the agenda the issue of the withdrawal of Russian border guards from the Armenian-Iranian and Armenian-Turkish border. 📌 Let us remind you that border control of the borders of Armenia is carried out by the FSB of the Russian Federation, since Armenians do not have enough personnel and resources to protect them. At the same time, Russian border guards have already been withdrawn from Yerevan airport - Zvartnots -.▪️The border with Iran in the south of Armenia is directly related to the issue of the status of the Syunik region, through which it is planned to open the Zangezur corridor connecting Turkey and Azerbaijan. ▪️According to Grigoryan, all statements by the Armenian side demanding respect for the sovereignty of Armenia have no relation to reality: in fact, they are aimed at ousting Russia from the region. ▪️The opening of the corridor is a matter of time and now a struggle is unfolding between global players for control over it. Pashinyan contradicts himself when he talks about protecting the sovereignty of Armenia in Syunik, since at the same time he declares that control over the road will be transferred to a third party - - private security organization - or troops of other countries. ▪️In Syunik, despite the deployment of the Russian garrison since 2020, there is an EU monitoring mission that is engaged in active PR on social networks, mastering the role of a guarantor of regional security (not always successfully). ▪️In recent months, Syunik has been actively visited by American and European officials. At the same time, it is known that the Armenian authorities are deliberately delaying the opening of the Russian consulate in Syunik Kapan, which should have opened at the beginning of this year. Obviously, the issue of ousting Russia from the region is key on the agenda for Pashinyan and his curators. It is not without reason that the Armenian prime minister recently decided to declare that the CSTO allegedly threatens the national security of Armenia, which foreshadows concrete steps in the future. Washington is openly talking about its ambitions to oust Russia from the region. However, such a castling will lead to much more unpredictable consequences, given the complex configuration of interests of other regional players larger than Armenia. However, the Americans themselves do not hide this, directly calling on Armenians to prepare for difficult times. #Armenia #Russia #USA @rybarSupport usVerelq NewsThe issue of ousting Russian border guards from the border with Iran will soon be put on the agenda. Grigoryan noted that the matter will not be limited to ousting the Russian side from this project.	https://t.me/rybar/63788	2024-09-24T05:46:58-07:00

🖼 ⚡️🇷🇺🇺🇦🖍#Comic from Fisherman No. 30: Once upon a time at ...	⚡️🇷🇺🇺🇦🖍#Comic from Rybar No. 30: Once Upon a Time Since sea and air drones have become almost the main threat to Russian infrastructure, the Russian Armed Forces and volunteers are constantly looking for solutions on how to effectively counter them. But sometimes the solution becomes not the most obvious, but at the same time simple ideas. Shooting down BECs from helicopters is just one of those things. And our new episode is about how this idea was born and why pilots like it so much. Synopsis: The Ukrainian Armed Forces are trying by all means to inflict damage on military - and, indeed, civilian - targets in Russia. Instead of effective long-range weapons, the Armed Forces of Ukraine use a large number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned boats (UBC). Single BECs can damage port infrastructure or a sea vessel. They became a real headache, which turned out to be quite difficult to deal with. And so, helicopters proved to be an effective means in the fight against this type of weapon. They patrol the sea in search of targets and, hovering in the air, practice targeting BECs using onboard weapons. But not everything is so simple: the enemy does not sit idly by, he changes and improves both attack tactics and the devices themselves. In addition to the usual custom kamikaze boats, BECs armed with missiles, and BECs equipped with guides for MLRS projectiles, and BECs with reinforced hulls, whose task is to divert fire onto themselves while the rest of the flock of drones is trying to break through to the target...📌 You can download the comic using the links: RU | EN | AR | CN#Russia #Ukraine @rybarWe hope you liked the comic from our artists.

For example, in Italy alone, the candidacy of incumbent President Maia Sandu received 80,140 votes.▪️In the parliamentary elections in the summer of 2021, Sandu’s now ruling PAS party won a crushing victory based on the results of foreign voting, receiving 182,654 votes - 85.98%.▪️Experience previous elections demonstrates the critical importance of foreign voting for Sandu's office. That is why the current president, throughout her entire term, met with representatives of the diaspora during any business trip to the West.▪️The election fraud of Sandu’s office is also voting by mail only for selected countries: the USA, Canada, Iceland, Norway, Finland and Sweden. Obviously, voting by mail was not provided for Moldovans in Russia, since Sandu’s office is unlikely to get the desired result from them than from countries of friendly democracy.▪️Let’s not forget that the Central Election Commission of Moldova is under the direct control of the American USAID and the British UK Aid, so there is no way to say that there is any transparency in the electoral process. 🔻However, along with such trends, it is necessary to note the passivity of the Moldovan diaspora in the Russian Federation, with which, unlike Western diasporas, no one is working systematically so far. Even despite the fact that pro-Romanian and anti-Russian forces have long come to power in Moldova. In this context, statements by Sandu and Western representatives about Russian interference in the Moldovan elections look especially ridiculous. #Moldova #Russia&nbsp;&nbsp; @rybarSupport usSputnik MoldovaDiaspora - about the CEC’s decision to open only 5 polling stations in Russia: we were deprived of the right to voteCitizens of Moldova living in Russia are outraged by the CEC’s decision to open only five polling stations in the Russian Federation.	https://t.me/rybar/63785	2024-09-24T01:52:01-07:00

The authenticity of the video has not been officially confirmed, but against the backdrop of other events it looks quite plausible. Early this year it became known that the Azerbaijanis had chosen the Chinese-Pakistani JF-17C fighter as a replacement for the outdated MiG-29. In total, it was planned to purchase about 60 units. Updating the aviation fleet is an important component of any army, which is what they are doing in Baku. It is curious that their main geopolitical enemy at the moment, represented by Armenia, is doing practically nothing in the matter of real strengthening of the armed forces. Of course, fighters of this type were used only once in combat, and their real capabilities are in question. However, these are still new, completely modern aircraft, while the Armenians so far have only a chaotic purchase of everything in the world without any consistency. #Azerbaijan #Pakistan@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63783	2024-09-24T00:05:10-07:00

Today, the Israeli Air Force launched strikes on the territory of the neighboring republic: not only border areas were under fire, but also cities located at a great distance from the border, including Baalbek.▪️According to statements by the IDF press service, the strikes were preemptive in nature and were carried out in order to to undermine Hezbollah's ability to bombard northern Israel. The target of the bombing was ammunition depots - there are many videos on the Internet of secondary detonations after the arrivals.▪️As ​​of the evening, there were at least 300 launches from fighters. According to the Lebanese Ministry of Health, 274 people were killed and 1,024 were injured of varying degrees of severity. At the same time, it is not specified exactly how many casualties were among the civilian population and members of Hezbollah.❗Amid the raid, a mass exodus of residents of the southern part of Lebanon began - it occurred after people’s phones began receiving calls from Israel calling for an urgent evacuation. The IDF limited itself to asking them to stay away from Lebanese Hezbollah targets in order to avoid casualties.▪️In response to the strikes by Israeli troops, the Lebanese group fired several salvos, firing more than 100 rockets in the morning. Some of them reached Palestinian territories in the West Bank and fell in the vicinity of both Jewish settlements and Arab villages, leading to fires.▪️Not wanting to reduce the intensity of tension, the Israelis soon attacked the Lebanese capital Beirut once again: hits hit a residential apartment in the controlled - Hezbollah - Ad-Dahiya region. According to preliminary information, Ali Karaki, in fact the third person in the leadership of the organization, was eliminated. Expectedly, the current Israeli authorities, under previously stated pretexts, continued massive attacks on Lebanon. The goal here is not only to destroy Hezbollah’s combat potential, but also to try to provoke it into a response that would free the government’s hands to further escalate the conflict. Most likely, attacks of this scale will continue until the ultra-Orthodox authorities achieve the outbreak of a full-fledged Third Lebanon War , which guarantees the possibility of their continued stay in power. Moreover, this fact is understood on both sides of the front. High resolution mapEnglish version#Israel #map #Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63773	2024-09-23T11:47:33-07:00

But this is exactly what the Kyiv authorities consistently denied for two and a half years, assuring everyone the world community in all people's love, support and legitimacy.📌And since there is organized resistance, we can purely hypothetically assume that it will still raise its head. Now imagine that this hypothetical resistance will not only set fire to cars, distribute leaflets, eliminate TCC employees, but will go further. Let’s say, seize a weapon supplied by the West - for example, one M270 or HIMARS - and direct it not to the north, but towards the conditional Romania, Moldova or Poland. These will turn out to be Houthis in the Odessa style. What a picture it would be: Russia, it turns out, has nothing to do with it, because this is popular resistance. And it turned out to be inconvenient, because what the West set up got out of control. It’s a pity that this is just a hypothetical scenario. Although there didn’t seem to be any resistance either. #Odessa #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramBefore everyone else. Well, almost.

Colonel General Kuzovlev He did not ask for the position and, based on purely statistical indicators, did not have significant defeats. Having managed to command two districts at once in six months and eventually become the commander of the Moscow Military District, he did not spend a single day at the newly opened headquarters on Kosmodamianskaya Embankment, for which he immediately came to the attention of Old Arbat officials, becoming the object of personal hostility. Kuzovlev was among the first to promptly formed and sent personnel to stop the breakthrough in the Kursk direction. And although Kursk was and remains the area of ​​​​responsibility of the Grv (s) -North, the commander of the Moscow Military District did not fail to lend a helping hand to his comrade at the front. On September 11, 2024, Andrei Belousov arrived at the command post of the Grv (s) -West. The Minister of Defense tried to test the environment and understand what kind of mood prevailed at the group’s headquarters, for which he took Evgeny Nikiforov with him. The inspection not only did not reveal any violations, but was also fully satisfied with the group’s work. Today, the forces of the Grv(s) -West are destroying the enemy’s layered defenses on the approaches to Kupyansk and have already reached the Oskol River, and revenge for the events of the fall of 2022 will be the main thing a challenge for Sergei Kuzovlev himself. Colonel General Anashkin The command highly appreciated his services as commander of the 8th Army. Having become the chief of staff of the district in January 2024, just two months later Gennady Anashkin was appointed commander of the Southern Military District and awarded the Order of Merit for the Fatherland, 2nd class with swords. The South group of troops today has significantly increased its forces: back in July, enemy sources wrote on the accumulation of reserves in the Zaporozhye direction. Throughout the year, Anashkin has been increasing the combat and numerical strength of the district’s artillery brigades using cannon artillery, largely thanks to friendly relations with his neighbor in the operational direction and concurrently the deputy commander of the OGV (s) Mikhail Teplinsky. Despite the ongoing positional battles in the direction, the command of the OGV ( c) believes that it is the South group that will have to win the strategic initiative in 2025, but Anashkin himself strives not to appear in the information field and does not use hardware resources for PR campaigns, believing that a good commander is an inconspicuous commander.

The hits hit a residential building. As the press service of the Israel Defense Forces stated, the target was another high-ranking leader of the Lebanese group, Ali Karaki, the commander of its southern front. He is nominally the third person in the leadership of the Shiite organization. According to Israeli media, after the death of special forces commander Radwan Ibrahim Aqil Karaki took his place as a result of a previous airstrike on Beirut. If the information is confirmed, this means that the Israelis destroyed the entire military leadership of Hezbollah. Against this background, the statement by Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant that the group's Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah was left alone does not sound so far-fetched.#Israel #Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63769	2024-09-23T09:48:45-07:00

The news once again indicates the intentions of the leadership in Tehran to expand the geography of uranium development. There is still not as much uranium ore in Burkina Faso as in neighboring Niger, but the Islamic Republic did not succeed with the latter due to Western intervention. There is another side to the situation - there is a possibility that Iranian companies may try to take a share in market, displacing Russian projects. And there is interest in the country in Moscow - Rosatom recently entered the final stage of agreeing on the construction of a nuclear power plant in Burkina Faso. Of course, the conclusion by the authorities in Ouagadougou of an agreement with a country close to Russia is much better than similar agreements with the West.

To the southwest, a significant advance of Russian troops was recorded in the Peschany area. Judging by the footage of objective control, Russian troops are fighting on the territory of one of the large strongholds, from where the northern outskirts of Kruglyakovka are less than two and a half kilometers away.▪️At the same time, there has been no information yet about the withdrawal of Ukrainian formations from the Volchy forest and nearby balkas, exactly the same as about the retreat of the Ukrainian Armed Forces from the -pocket- of Berestovoy. Considering the configuration of the terrain, it is quite possible that there will still be a focal presence of enemy forces in this zone.▪️To the north, the Russian Armed Forces established full control over Kislovka, repelling several attacks in the direction of neighboring Kotlyarka. They also improved the tactical situation in the forests near Sinkovka, and the Aerospace Forces aviation continues to systematically strike at the pontoon crossings of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the Oskol River in the Kupyansk-Uzlovoy area. persist, then in the near future we should expect the Russian Armed Forces to reach the water barrier with a further cutting in two of the Ukrainian group on the left bank of the Oskol River.

The Chadian Foreign Ministry denied statements with the wording that At the moment there are no such agreements, thereby not denying the fact that they are being worked out. That is, the leadership in N'Djamena, although it delayed negotiations on the renewal of agreements with the United States, was unable to cope with external pressure.📌 When in the spring of 2024 it became known about the intention of the Chadian authorities to end the American military presence, it resembled an electoral move to gain additional votes in anticipation of local presidential elections. When they took place, and the necessary results were obtained, then in N'Djamena they simply decided to play back. All this is another evidence that the influence of the collective West on Chad still remains significant and is clearly manifested in various things - from the deployment of a contingent from NATO member Hungary before external economic pressure.#Africa #USA #Chad@rybarSupport usVoice of AmericaUS general: US, Chad planning return of US troopsUS also moving forces into West African coast in reshuffle around Niger withdrawal	https://t.me/rybar/63764	2024-09-23T04:35:13-07:00

Russian troops continue to implement a chain of offensive actions in several sectors of the Yuzhnodonetsk direction. 🔻At the Konstantinovka-Vodyanoye line, units of the Russian Armed Forces were able to advance into the forest belts in the vicinity of the Solenenkaya gully, having traveled about half the way to the southern outskirts of Katerynovka.🔻In the Vodyanoye area, Russian attack aircraft reached the forest belt closest to the settlement from the west, and also continue to fight in the mine area -South Donbass No. 3-. By the morning of this day, the enemy was finally knocked out of their positions in the industrial zone. Artillery and aviation strikes continue in Ugledar and the surrounding area, as well as the arrival of attack UAVs. There have been no reports of an attack in the direction of the city itself from the south, which, however, is understandable given the experience of previous attempts. To the east there are battles in the dachas, which the Russian Armed Forces fighters latched on to a few days ago.🔻West of Pavlovka, halfway to Prechistovka, a slight advance of the Russian Armed Forces was again recorded. Judging by the footage on the Internet, Russian attack aircraft in an armored personnel carrier dropped into a forest belt not far from the Berestovaya gully, which runs parallel to the Kashlagach River. 🔻At the Prechistovka-Novodonetskoe line, the front also began to move: some time ago, Russian troops began to advance in the area of ​​the Shaitanka Grave mound 167.7, and by the middle of the week they had captured several forest belts towards Zolotaya Niva. ▪️The offensive was preceded by artillery preparation, including shelling from TOS-1A heavy flamethrower systems, and UAV operators hit the Caesar self-propelled gun.

🇺🇸 On the prospects of a shutdown in the US on the eve of the U...	🇺🇸 On the prospects of a shutdown in the US ahead of the elections, the US Congress is once again faced with the possibility of temporarily suspending the work of the federal government on September 30. The main disagreements between the parties, as before, relate to budget priorities, especially regarding funding for defense and social programs. Republicans, especially in the House of Representatives, are pushing for spending cuts and want to keep funding at 2024 levels. Democrats, in turn, support increasing them through 2025 to fulfill promises to improve social and defense programs. House Speaker Mike Johnson until recently pushed for a GOP-friendly stopgap spending bill that would fund the federal government for another six months. The bill meant maintaining spending at 2024 levels without increasing funding for some programs. 🔻In addition, it contained one very important point proposed by Donald Trump - a bill (SAVE Act) requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration in elections. In this way, the former president hoped to thwart the Democrats' plan to win the election by attracting thousands of illegal migrants to vote for Kamala Harris. However, on September 19, Johnson suffered a major setback: 14 Republicans, joining almost all Democrats, voted against the proposed bill. Conservatives felt that the act did not include sufficient measures to cut costs, hawks were concerned about the possibility of undermining the US defense potential, and moderates were worried about the threat of a shutdown too close to the elections. As a result, on September 23, Mike Johnson broke down under the pressure of his fellow party members and Democrats and agreed to the so-called -Plan B-. It provides for the approval of a spending bill that extends the government until December 20 of this year, and also excludes the SAVE Act promoted by Trump. Despite the fact that Johnson, during negotiations with Trump, managed to convince him that the shutdown would have a much worse impact on the president's position in the election rather than repealing the SAVE Act, the consequences of the failure of Johnson's original plan are obvious. The absence of a law requiring citizenship to register voters in elections will allow Kamala Harris and Co. to attract hundreds of thousands of illegal migrants to vote for themselves.#USA@rybar in collaboration with @usaperiodicalSupport usTelegramAmerican number⚫️ Yes, yes: Speaker of the House of Representatives, Republican Mike Johnson, broke under the pressure his fellow party members and Democrats and agreed to the so-called Plan B.

Well, formally there is, and Maria Zakharova reminded about it during the briefing on the sidelines of the 15th Eurasian Women's Forum in St. Petersburg on September 20. 📌We are talking about the creation of an International Organization for the Russian Language, a decision about which was made about a year ago by the leaders of the CIS at a meeting in Bishkek. Zakharova was quite optimistic about the prospects for this organization to quickly formalize and begin work, and became in fact the first major Russian official to remember the project this year. According to the plan voiced by the President of Kazakhstan Tokayev, the organization was supposed to become almost the second Fracophonie or at least the Commonwealth Portuguese-speaking countries, but in fact it has become an opportunity for Kazakhstan to reject accusations of de-Russification of the country and so far serves only this thesis. At the same time, we will not agree with the optimism of our Foreign Ministry regarding the prospects of the organization. According to our information, the procedure for the official ratification of this agreement by at least three CIS states that signed it has not been completed, which is necessary to launch organizational procedures and hold the long-awaited ministerial conference, which should launch the process of actually creating the organization. Moreover, the only activity of responsible structures in this direction is the internal struggle for the post of formal leader (secretary, coordinator, etc.) of this organization, as well as the determination of Sochi (and not St. Petersburg, as Tokayev proposed) as the location of the Secretariat. If the promotion of the Russian language will be carried out at the same pace and with the same enthusiasm, then indeed Central Asia will soon speak Turkish. #Kazakhstan #Russia #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usTACCIt was decided to establish an international organization for the Russian language following the results of the CIS summit; the initiative to establish such a structure was taken by the President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev	https://t.me/rybar/63760	2024-09-23T01:06:14-07:00

Forwarded From Balkan Gossip Girl On the topic of British spies expelled from Russia, additional information has appeared about dubious contacts of MI6 with local Muslims. In fact, the technology has been developed by British specialists, and work on a similar front is not limited to the CIS and has been going on for a long time. True, it is not always successful. For example, one of the grandiose failures of Foggy Albion is associated with Macedonia. There, back in 1995, with funds from humanitarian - educational - funds from Great Britain, they tried to launch the first - independent - university in the Albanian language. It is from here that the resistance movement, dreaming of a Greater Albania, will subsequently spread across the Balkans. At the opening ceremony in Tetovo, riots broke out and passions grew more intense. And then the applicants, together with the self-proclaimed rector, demanded from the state a quota for Albanian graduates to occupy government positions. Doesn't remind you of anything? Human rights activists were sent to Tetovo, and to everyone’s surprise, it suddenly turned out that the applicants did not have documents confirming their identity. Because they were not presented as citizens of Macedonia or, at worst, Albania, but as infiltrators from Great Britain and the USA. From the first day, the university itself became a base camp for Albanian militants: about one and a half thousand armed students ended up in Tetovo through the efforts of the Mi-6. James Bisset, who served as the Canadian ambassador, later spoke about this. Journalist Scott Taylor then added fuel to the fire, who managed to take the lion's share of the footage out of the country and publish it. Under the cover of Britain, networks for disseminating democratic Islam were already operating at that time, and one of them was gathering Muslim spiritual leaders, preachers, imams and heads of large religious communities. Can you imagine how they have improved their skills over the years? @balkanossiper - we have been setting global trends since June 28, 1914	https://t.me/rybar/63758	2024-09-22T23:31:02-07:00

Russian troops hit enemy targets in the Khmelnitsky, Vinnitsa, Dnepropetrovsk and Kharkov regions. Ukrainian formations attacked the Crimean peninsula for two days, and also hit ammunition depots in the Krasnodar Territory and Tver Region. In the Kursk region, fierce fighting continues in the Glushkovsky district, where the Russian Armed Forces are stopping the enemy’s attempts to advance forward. In the Korenevsky and Sudzhansky districts, attacks are carried out on Ukrainian Armed Forces equipment and strongholds in forest belts. In the Limansky direction, Russian troops liberated Nevskoye, advancing to the west almost four kilometers and breaking the enemy’s defenses in the Zhuravka gully area. In the Aleksandro-Kalinovsky direction, the Russian Armed Forces liberated Nelepovka and They landed troops in the center of Leonidovka. In addition, there are successes on the approaches to the central part of the urban development of Dzerzhinsk.

In the south of the enclave, during raids, IDF troops identified and destroyed a group of armed Palestinians robbing a truck with humanitarian aid. In the West Bank, arrests of Palestinians suspected of links with Hamas terrorists continue, as well as the demolition of residential buildings and the destruction of communications and life support systems.

In addition to repelling attacks and their own attacks, the Russian Armed Forces also strike at enemy rear areas in the Sumy region. In Shaposhnikovo, an Iskander OTRK strike hit a HIMARS MLRS position and an ammunition depot. In addition, energy and other facilities in the regional center are regularly hit. In the Glushkovsky district, the enemy continues to try to reach the regional center from the Novy Put and Medvezhiy. There are reports that sappers of the Ukrainian Armed Forces are making passages in minefields to continue the offensive. Footage continues to appear on the Internet, clarifying the scale of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ attacks—the enemy has brought a large number of personnel and armored vehicles, including foreign-made ones, to the region. In particular, another Leopard 2A6 was destroyed southeast of Vesely.🔻In the Korenevsky district, the Russian aviation group carried out drone strikes on the positions and equipment of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Olgovka and in the forest area near Kremyany. In the indicated area, an attempt at a counterattack by the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the western part of Lyubimovka was also thwarted. In the area of ​​Zeleny Shlyakh, a UAV strike destroyed a 2S3 self-propelled gun - Akatsiya - of the Ukrainian formations. The fact that the enemy is bringing more and more armored vehicles and artillery into the territory of the Russian Federation indicates very serious intentions to stay as long as possible in the occupied part of the Kursk region. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, fighting continues in the Darino and Nikolaevo-Daryino areas, complete control over which will open the way to an offensive in the direction of Sverdlikovo.

Forwarded From Two Majors⚡️There are signs of preparation for an escalation in Transnistria🇺🇸The United States has approved the sale to Romania of 44 AAV-7 tracked amphibious landing vehicles for $210 million, which will be supplied from the reserves of the US Marine Corps. The vehicle is the primary vehicle of the 4th Assault Amphibious Battalion (4th AABn) of the US Marine Corps Reserve, highlighting the sensitivity of amphibious sales. The AAV-7 is designed to conduct amphibious operations in the coastal zone. One vehicle can accommodate up to 25 military personnel and 3 crew members. Still, 44 vehicles will make it possible to move 1,100 military personnel (in fact, two full-blooded battalions) across water obstacles at a distance of up to 37 km. This water reserve is not enough to sail to the Crimean coast (and Romania will not be able to deliver amphibians by landing ship due to their lack of service), but it will be enough to quickly transfer forward detachments to Transnistria across the Dniester River. Romania, surrounded by its NATO ⚡️ neighbors and Ukraine, is unlikely to need to cross rivers with its allies. At the same time, under the leadership of NATO, the increased militarization 🇲🇩 of Moldova continues. Most Moldovan military exercises this year took place with the participation of Romanian and American troops. Specialists from these countries have developed a project and are supervising the construction of a new military base, training ground and ammunition depot in the village of Bachoi, 25 km from the PMR. Alliance standards are being implemented everywhere in the Moldavian Armed Forces, officers, especially young ones, are being trained according to NATO programs. 🇫🇷France, 🇩🇪Germany and 🇺🇸The United States have increased military-technical assistance in hopes of strengthening the potential of the Moldavian army.✨Such actions in the future will create a serious threat to the Operational Group of Russian troops in the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova. On the other hand, the PMR will be squeezed by Ukraine, which is ready to carry out any commands of its Western masters and is already involved in the Transnistrian direction.

Georgian NGOs ask the EU to suspend the visa-free regime with Georgia in order to demonstrate to voters the consequences of the government’s actions ahead of the parliamentary elections. Threaten To convince of the wrong choice of the ruling party at the vote by blackmail - the scheme is so old and trivial that it is not even clear what representatives of non-governmental organizations are hoping for. A visa-free regime is, of course, good and tempting. Only only a small category of Georgian citizens used it. Traveling to Europe is not cheap, and not everyone could afford it. The majority of Georgians will not be affected by the abolition of visa-free travel (if there is one). But this will hit representatives of pro-Western NGOs or politicians directly, so it’s not hard to guess who will suffer more.#Georgia #EU@rybarSupport usTelegramSputnik Georgia🇬🇪🇪🇺 Some Georgian NGOs have appealed to the European Union with a request to suspend the visa-free regime with Georgia, the American McCain Institute reported .The goal is to demonstrate to voters the consequences of the government’s actions - the Georgian Dream - on the eve of the parliamentary elections...	https://t.me/rybar/63741	2024-09-22T08:20:07-07:00

On September 21, the Brunet-Takamori 2024 exercise ended - the first military training of the ground forces of France and Japan, conducted on the territory of the island state. 100 military personnel of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces and about 50 soldiers of the French army took part in the exercise. The main focus during training was on counter-guerrilla operations. 🔻The main purpose of the exercise, in addition to practicing the fight against rebels, was to demonstrate cooperation between the two states against the backdrop of instability in the Asia-Pacific region. By the way, other steps are being taken in this direction. The French and Japanese are planning to soon conclude an agreement on mutual access - it will allow troops to be stationed on each other's territory for joint military exercises. And although, as can be seen, bilateral training is already taking place, the agreement removes some bureaucratic barriers, which could lead to even more exercises. In general, recently there has been an intensification of French foreign policy in the Asia-Pacific region - the French are also interested in interaction with the Philippines, where the authorities are creating a network of partnerships in order to contain China. However, at the same time, it is noticeable that Paris is trying not to damage relations with the PRC. For example, last year France was among the first echelon of countries that spoke out against the location of a NATO liaison office in Japan. It is likely that this approach - abandoning very radical measures and gradually building up ties with countries in the Asia-Pacific region through exercises - will continue to prevail.

A notable incident amid tensions was Ethiopia's supply of weapons to the autonomous region of Puntland.▪️Since the discussion of the new draft constitution of Somalia, which caused a scandal between different parts of the country, the Puntland authorities have not sworn allegiance to the central government again. Now it is learned that, like the separatists in Hargeisa, they are negotiating with the leadership of Addis Ababa. Of course, this caused discontent in Mogadishu, whose authorities condemned such daring actions of both the Ethiopians and the autonomists. True, the convoy that brought weapons to Puntland was accompanied by militias from the Ethiopian state of Somalia, disbanded a year ago. what the Ethiopian authorities can refer to.▪️As ​​for the general situation in the country, battles with Al-Shabab Islamists continue. Autonomous regions loyal to the Somalis are conducting successful operations against militants, and also repelling a large number of attacks. At the same time, the Somali armed forces are stabilizing the situation in the country, restoring order after tribal clashes that occur in various regions of the country.🔻If the Ethiopian authorities continue to commit such daring actions , then we should probably expect retaliatory actions from the Egyptians, who are actively settling in the country. We should not forget that the Americans also side with Cairo in the Ethiopian-Egyptian conflict, which also creates serious obstacles for the leadership of Addis Ababa.

In addition, there are clashes in the area of ​​​​the Dzerzhinsk city hospital, as well as to the west of the bakery, where the Russian Armed Forces have significantly advanced in the direction of Dzerzhinsky Street. Yesterday evening, footage of the explosion of a building, allegedly where Russian soldiers were located, was published on the Internet: a sabotage group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine penetrated into the room and placed a charge. The event itself took place not far from the former administration of Dzerzhinsk, however, more accurate data on the presence of Russian troops in this area has not yet been received, and the breakthrough itself without support from flank attacks and the occupation of the Dzerzhinsky mine, taking into account the severity of the fighting taking place in the urban area, looks risky. At the same time, the control zone The RF Armed Forces in reality differ from the one for which there is information: firstly, not all successful actions of Russian troops are captured on camera, and secondly, in urban battles the situation is dynamically changing due to the peculiarities of battles in the city, combined with constant attacks on each other’s positions.▪️At the same time, Russian troops are advancing on Dzerzhinsk from the south in the Zabalka microdistrict. According to available information, Russian troops, after gaining a foothold on the territory of school No. 2, expanded the zone of control in the direction of Gaidar, Rimsky-Korsakov streets and Shakhterov Avenue.▪️ At the same time, Russian attack aircraft finally liberated Nelepovka and cleared out the pocket between the village and Dzerzhinsky, advancing in the direction of Shcherbinovka.🔻In addition, a significant event for the site occurred the other day. After several unsuccessful enemy counterattacks in the direction of Nelepovka, the landing force of the Russian Armed Forces - on the shoulders of the retreating troops - under heavy artillery fire from the Ukrainian Armed Forces, advanced several kilometers north towards Leonidovka, successfully gaining a foothold in the center of the village on Klimenko Street. Thus, the defense of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, built for years in this area, was broken through.❗️Further establishment of control over the settlement, subject to a successful attack on Shcherbinovka on the opposite bank of the Krivoi Torets River, will allow the Dzerzhinsk garrison to be semi-encircled from the west. Considering the simultaneous offensive in the east from Kirovo, in the future the city may be surrounded from two directions at once.

Apparently, the Americans are gradually preparing to exert more serious pressure on the Georgian authorities, since Previously, Washington limited sanctions only against minor officials and politicians. The effectiveness of these measures looks quite dubious, given Georgia’s current position and the desire to maintain a balance in the country’s foreign policy, especially on the eve of parliamentary elections. Moreover, draconian measures do not always give the desired result, but rather the opposite. On the one hand, this is a show of force, but on the other hand, ordinary people who will vote see the true attitude of the allies towards their country. Nevertheless, the transition to political terror on the part of the United States and allies was expected.

Thus, all the previous insights that we wrote about recently were confirmed. One of the first points of QUAD’s statement was cooperation in the healthcare sector. Thus, the authorities of the participating countries want to show that the bloc focuses specifically on the development of humanitarian ties, and not on containing one or another country - China, by the way, is not mentioned at all in the document. 🔻However, the most interesting part begins next. In the security sphere, the parties agreed to conduct patrols in the Indo-Pacific region - the first will take place in 2025. The patrol locations were not disclosed. But it can be assumed that QUAD coast guard services will be in the South China Sea, parts of the Indian Ocean where Chinese research vessels sail, and Oceania - countries located in this region, the statement pays much attention. ▪️Australia, USA, Japan and India will continue to work to provide information to countries in the region about what is happening in their coastal waters. This is done under the pretext of fighting crime, but in this case no one forgets about tracking Chinese ships. In general, the summit was full of various types of agreements, the results of which we should see in the near future, despite a possible change of administration in the United States. Even if Donald Trump wins the election, QUAD will likely continue to exist - it was under the former president that new life was breathed into the four-way dialogue with the goal of containing China and countering its influence in the region. #Australia #India #USA #Japan@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usTelegramRybar🇦🇺🇮🇳🇺🇸🇯🇵 Just last week we wrote about the upcoming summit of QUAD - an organization that includes the USA, Japan, India and Australia.

Australia, which is also part of the new informal association SQUAD, remained a not very noticeable player against the backdrop of Tokyo and Washington. And now Canberra has finally -woke up-. The Australian ambassador to the Philippines recently said that the country's authorities plan to increase their presence in the waters through cooperation with Manila. The parties are discussing conducting even more patrols in the South China Sea. 🔻However, it is still unclear what patrol format we are talking about - bilateral with the Philippines or multilateral with the participation of the United States or Japan. In the latter case, the activity is aimed more at demonstrating the unified position of several states on the South China Sea issue, rather than at demonstrating the ambitions of an individual country. Bilateral patrols make clear the degree of support for the Philippines' claims in the waters. And Australia cannot boast of anything special here - the first and last event of this format took place in November 2023. After this, Australians only participated in multilateral patrols. ▪️And this is most likely the result of Canberra’s deliberate policy, which is based on maintaining a conditional balance in relations with China, Australia’s main economic partner. Perhaps this is why Philippine-Australian cooperation in general has never been aimed at external security challenges to Manila.&nbsp; The ambassador's recent statements may indicate a change in Australia's position. However, given the warming in relations between Beijing and Canberra, it is too early to talk about this. Therefore, the Australians are likely to increase their presence in the South China Sea through multilateral patrols, so as not to reverse the progress made in developing ties with China. #Australia #Philippines @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usTelegramRybar🇺🇸🇵🇭🇯🇵 Despite recent negotiations between China and the Philippines to reduce tensions in the South China Sea, the situation in the region continues to escalate.

Forwarded From Global Studies🇹🇷 What Rybar commented in the context of the results of the Turkish operation in Syria and Iraq clearly demonstrates the prospects of the Turks in this direction. In the current version, they are simply not visible. And if we talk about the reasons for the current situation in the Turkish operation against the Kurds, then we should return to the roots in 2014-2015. Do you remember what preceded the invasion of Iraq in December 2015?♦️In Turkey, by 2014, the economic situation had seriously worsened, which was expressed by increased inflation and the beginning of the depreciation of the lira. The situation inside the country was deteriorating, as was the growing discontent of citizens. In addition, in 2015, more active attacks by militants - the Kurdistan Workers' Party - began in the Turkish provinces bordering Iraq, which ultimately became a pretext for the invasion of Iraq. Then Erdogan hoped to carry out a small victorious war and regain the favor of the citizens, but the plan was unsuccessful, and the internal political turmoil continued. All this ultimately led to the well-known attempt by supporters of the preacher Fethullah Gülen to carry out a coup in July 2016. But the Turkish authorities were able to hold out and struck a blow at the Gülenists themselves. And already in August, in order to distract the population and supposedly protect Turkey’s interests in the fight against IS and Kurdish forces, the Turks began a ground operation in northern Syria, occupying part of the territories.♦️I, of course, omit the part details, but after reading this post, one can conclude that one of the main drivers of the Turkish operation was the intention to distract the population from the deepening crisis through an imaginary fight against terrorism and the government of Bashar al-Assad. In the short term, Erdogan achieved the desired approval and support from the Turkish population. But subsequently, as life worsened, people began to have more and more questions: why was all this necessary if we began to live worse? And now the Turkish economy is moving in one direction and it cannot be called positive. The Kurdish problem has not gone away, there are still a lot of migrants and almost the only way to demonstrate the activity of the state remains military activity in Syria and Turkey. #TurkeyGlobalistics - subscribe to the channelTelegramRybar🇹🇷🏴 Turkish President Recep Erdogan summed up the operations of the armed forces and security forces from the beginning year, announcing the conduct of 35 thousand special events, the elimination of 825 terrorists and the prevention of 70 terrorist attacks.

Forwarded From Two Majors#Review #Summary for September 22, 2024▪️ The past week has again demonstrated the enemy’s ability to carry out UAV strikes on critical rear targets in our regions, this time on large ammunition depots. The governors, like robots, are clearly carrying out someone’s not very competent tem about -falling debris onto explosive objects-, which causes irritation on social networks, where videos of such falling debris are shared. At the same time, the effectiveness of combating air targets in our regions varies. Thus, yesterday’s missile attack of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Crimea was thwarted by the forces of the 31st air defense division, which indicates the feasibility of a widespread increase in the effectiveness of air defense. By the way, just yesterday signals began to be received about the inclusion of air defense units in the list of -fighting-, payments are expected for -days with shooting-, which will still be a step in motivating military personnel.▪️ Heavy fighting in the Kursk region remains high in intensity. The enemy withdraws elite airborne units and throws prisoners under the influence of methamphetamine, trained for three months by NATO instructors, into battle. In those directions where it was possible to push back the enemy (the area of ​​​​the settlements of Borki, Lyubimovka, Daryevka), they report that the enemy has completely mined the area. The enemy does not intend to withdraw from the region: footage of the destruction of artillery and equipment of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the region indicates that Kyiv is drawing both artillery and equipment into the occupation zone. In addition, in the south of the Glushkovsky district, the Armed Forces of Ukraine threw columns of foreign equipment with -Leopards- into battle. It is significant that the expensive equipment was not equipped with either adequate anti-cumulative shields or dynamic protection. This approach may indicate an emergency transfer to the Leopardov direction in order to please Zelensky’s hysterical political goals. ▪️ In the Pokrovsky and Yuzhnodonetsk directions, the Russian Armed Forces maintain their offensive potential, tighten up their rear and align their flanks. Ukrainsk has been taken, our troops are fighting in the suburbs of Gornyak, information has appeared about the capture of Ostroy, which indicates the ongoing closure of the cauldron north of Krasnohorivka. The zone of control to the north and west of Ugledar is expanding, one cannot but rejoice at the visible development of the tactics of the Russian Army in cutting off the fortified areas of the Armed Forces of Ukraine from supplies and skillfully enveloping enemy defense centers.▪️ Showdowns regarding the case of Ernest and Goodwin (-landing party- from the Ministry of Defense and Far Eastern Territories of the Russian Federation, the FSB of Russia landed and started work) a complex of problems again stirred up in the public sphere. In particular, there is a shortage of prepared and trained attack aircraft, which leads to the use of the same regular artillerymen as infantry, whose training takes a long time. The problem also remains with UAV operators and specialists from front-line laboratories for the manufacture and repair of drones. These military personnel occupy the positions of shooters, snipers, and so on, and due to the slowness of the military department in matters of changing the staffing structures of units in accordance with the technological structure of war, there are critically few positions - UAV operator - at the level of tactical units. This gives the commander every right to use such troops as assault infantry, even if the self-taught UAV operator is able to bring more combat value in a different capacity. The problem of using specialists (including those with recorded relatively rare VUS), as they write to us from all over the front, is typical for many areas.

The difficult situation in the Turkish economy is pushing the country's leadership to take further unpopular measures that we cannot ignore. Let us recall now that the discount rate of the Turkish Central Bank is 50%, and the inflation rate consistently exceeds 70%. The appointment of a representative of the American financial elite to the post of head of the Turkish Central Bank, as we told earlier, led to total dependence on the holders of Turkish government bonds. Now the Turkish authorities are faced with the task of transferring everything payments of the population in non-cash form and limit the level of expenses. To achieve this, new laws are being adopted to ban crypto and regulate lending.

And although it has not yet reached a full-fledged war, resonant events occur almost every day that threaten to move the conflict to a new stage. 🔻If earlier launches of missiles and drones by Hezbollah, as well as massive air raids by the Israeli Defense Forces were not such a frequent occurrence, the situation has changed somewhat after the Israelis blew up Lebanese pagers, as well as an attack on the capital of the republic. According to the Lebanese Ministry of Health, victims of a recent cyber attack Israel and the subsequent explosions left 4,000 people injured alone. And during the flights to the Ad-Dahiya area in Beirut, 37 Lebanese were killed, including Ibrahim Aqil, a senior leader of Hezbollah.▪️Meanwhile, according to Arabic-language media, during this day alone the Israeli Air Force carried out about 100 strikes on various areas in south of Lebanon. At the same time, the main hits occurred on targets in the area of ​​the Litani River, which is 30 kilometers north of the border with Israel. Hezbollah fighters are also not far behind and fired rockets at the northern part of Israel: more than 80 rockets were fired in the morning. Traditionally, hits on IDF targets have been announced, while the Israeli media reported about ammunition falling in open areas and near civilian infrastructure.🔻In general, no significant changes have occurred over the past 24 hours. Against this background, the press service of the Israel Defense Forces announced the completion of a series of attacks on Lebanon: at least 180 targets were allegedly hit, which were used for attacks in the Upper Galilee, Golan Heights and Safed. Despite promises of retaliation and loud threats, most likely Hezbollah will limit itself to continuing massive strikes. This is quite enough to artificially escalate tension and create the desired picture, which will be handed over to its population against the backdrop of the tragic events of recent days.

Enemy engineering units have intensified attempts to prepare passages in the minefields, likely in anticipation of the next offensive. At this time, Russian troops do not stop striking Ukrainian positions in the Sumy region and in the occupied territories of the Kursk region in order to reduce the enemy’s combat potential. Thus, in Stepovo, drones hit hangars with Ukrainian equipment and temporary deployment points of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. ▪️Combat aviation of the Russian Aerospace Forces in the Korenevsky district is also working effectively, where the positions of Ukrainian formations in Olgovka and in the forest area near Kremyany were under attack. At the same time, another attempt by the Ukrainian Armed Forces to counterattack Russian units in the western part of Lyubimovka was stopped. ▪️In the Sudzhansky district, Russian fighters are clearing the area south of Kamyshevka. A platoon of paratroopers from the 83rd brigade in armored vehicles reached enemy positions across the field and took control of two strong points of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. And in Novoivanovka, the Ukrainian Armed Forces brought an American M777 howitzer into position, which was also destroyed by Russian troops. On the southern flank, both objective control footage appeared, demonstrating the destroyed Ukrainian Armed Forces equipment, including the 2S3 Akatsiya self-propelled gun, and video footage of the disruption of the evacuation of members of Ukrainian formations in the Russian Konopelka area.

At the moment, it is not known for certain where exactly the Russian troops were attacking from: either from the side of the Zhuravka gully, where the zone of control of the Russian Armed Forces had also been expanded the day before, or from the side of Makeyevka. However, with the occupation of Nevsky, it makes no sense for Ukrainian formations to be either north or east of the settlement, since otherwise they will be in a virtual semi-encirclement. Therefore, there is a high probability of enemy presence in these areas. 🔻The liberation of Nevsky in itself is another completed task on the way to the liquidation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine bridgehead on the right bank of the Zherebets River. In the future, we can expect increased pressure from Russian troops towards the Terny-Torskoye line, which will be quite difficult for the enemy to hold.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Bärbock confidently stated that Moldovans are allegedly very worried about the so-called. Ukraine, after which Russia will invade Moldova. ▪️Such statements, which have been repeated for several years, are intended to justify the unenviable position of Moldova, from which they made an appendage territory to serve the economic and military interests of the so-called. Ukraine to the detriment of itself.▪️The meeting of the Platform, as well as the latest visits of Western politicians to Moldova, are election campaigning in favor of Maia Sandu, who is being helped to whip up anti-Russian hysteria. ▪️By the way, at a meeting of the Platform, Prime Minister Dorin Recan proposed creating a development and solidarity fund for the agricultural sector, which will provide assistance to farmers. Let us recall that Moldovan farmers have been actively protesting for several years due to the uncontrolled transit of Ukrainian grain and the destruction of the national agricultural sector for the sake of global corporations. The authorities pointedly ignored the demands of farmers, but recently suddenly - right before the elections - they remembered agriculture. ▪️Farmers resumed protests last week and the government decided to make concessions, now at the same time asking for help from Western partners. However, the EU will definitely not give money to Moldovan farmers, especially since the Moldovan authorities have already tried unsuccessfully to request help from the West to calm the farmers. 🔻After Sandu’s re-election, Moldova is clearly facing unenviable times and an increasingly obvious involvement of the republic in a military conflict. As we know, the preparation of the military airfield in Marculesti to accommodate F-16 fighters is in full swing. Sandu, with the support of the West, will find any excuse for these actions. #Germany #EU #Moldova #Ukraine @rybarSupport us ReutersGermany says Moldova could be next in line if Ukraine fallsSupport for Ukraine guarantees the survival of neighboring Moldova, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on Tuesday at a conference to address concerns about broadening Russian interference in the region.	https://t.me/rybar/63725	2024-09-21T07:41:01-07:00

The topic for discussion was the supposedly common problem in the field of logistics.▪️In addition to representatives of the traditionally pro-Western regimes of the ECOWAS countries, Mauritania and Equatorial Guinea, participants are Chadian authorities. They discussed the return of the Green Berets, who were expelled from the country in May. According to statements from the American side, they finally came to an agreement to once again station them in N'Djamena.▪️In addition, the presence of military personnel from Equatorial Guinea is also interesting. The country is surrounded by loyal Western allies, but at the same time its leadership is taking steps towards cooperation with China (whose authorities a couple of years ago planned to open a naval logistics center on the Atlantic coast). It is likely that under external pressure, the option of involving local authorities in the next American exercises. 🔻Well, obviously, the movement of the contingent withdrawn from Niger was discussed with other partners. Previously, Benin and Côte d'Ivoire, whose representatives are also taking part in the conference, were considered for this role. Still, American acumen is manifesting itself not only in Equatorial Africa, but also in the Sahel, replacing the French.#Africa #USA@rybarSupport uswww.africom.milU.S. Africa Command and Cameroon Armed Forces Host West Africa Logistics Conference in DoualaMilitary Logistics professionals from 13 African nations and organizations and the United States attend	https://t.me/rybar/63724	2024-09-21T06:35:23-07:00

At the same time, the work of Russian fighters is complicated by the active use of drones by Ukrainian formations. ▪️Significant successes have been achieved in recent days in the Vodyanoye area, where sections of the area north of the settlement came under the control of Russian troops, as well as in the vicinity of the Yuzhnodonobasskaya No. 1 mine. Meanwhile, at the facility of the same name number 3, fighting is taking place on the western outskirts. ▪️On the southern flank, evidence appeared of the advance of the Russian Armed Forces north of Prechistovka: there, the Russian armored group advanced across the fields towards Novoukrainka, without actually encountering any significant resistance from the Armed Forces of Ukraine on its way. Also, footage was published on the Internet showing the capture of members of Ukrainian formations in this area. Nevertheless, the subsequent assault on Novoukrainka may be complicated by the geographical features of the area - the settlement and its surroundings are located on a hill, which somewhat facilitates its defense from those attacking from the lowlands. 🔻Against the background of the latest advances of the Russian Armed Forces in the Yuzhnodonetsk direction, the enemy is in a very depressing situation. After the loss of control over the buildings of the crushing and screening department of the Yuzhnodonbasskaya No. 1- and No. 3 mines, the Ukrainian formations lost the ability to monitor the situation for tens of kilometers around. Apparently, the Russian command abandoned a frontal assault on the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Ugledar, which, although already heavily destroyed, but remains a convenient settlement for defense. Instead, the units are attacking in neighboring areas from Vodyanoy and Prechistovka, while simultaneously cutting off supply routes for the Ukrainian garrison in Ugledar.

His body was found late yesterday, several hours after the airstrike on Beirut. At the moment, the death of Ibrahim Aqeel is one of the largest losses in the ranks of the Lebanese group. This is taking into account the fact that after the murder of Fuad Shukri, he took his place as Deputy Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah and actually became the No. border to a full-fledged war, they are preparing to evacuate their citizens from Lebanon.🔻Now, in the hope of provoking Hezbollah into decisive action, the current Israeli authorities are consistently raising the stakes, as evidenced by both the recent massive bombings of pagers and the liquidation of high-ranking commanders and leaders of the Shiite group. And this if you don’t take into account the murder of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, for which the Axis of Resistance placed responsibility on the Israeli intelligence services and promised a tough response (however, so far nothing of such resonance has happened in relation to the Zionist state). And no matter how the Lebanese don’t wanted to succumb to obvious provocations from the ultra-Orthodox government, sooner or later they will have to give a response. Most likely, this will be the usual massive launch of drones and missiles against IDF targets. Moreover, the intensity of strikes has already increased somewhat in recent days.#Israel #Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63722	2024-09-21T03:34:01-07:00

If previously the Rwandan-backed March 23 Movement (M23) was the one most often in the news, now other factions are showing themselves more strongly. ▪️Against the background of the M23 offensive, cultists from CODECO have become more active: during the latest raids in the province of Jigu, they stole more than 10 people, killing about 30 more. The organization is fragmented groups of bandits attacking mainly civilians. They do not agree to a truce with the authorities because if they surrender, they will face the death penalty.▪️The Alliance of Democratic Forces, affiliated with the Islamic State, operates in a similar way. The attacks target Christian settlements, not army posts. They take property from villages, burn houses, execute one part of the population and try to recruit another. Such tactics do not bring any noticeable operational success - Islam in the DRC is widespread quite locally, and the religious factor in local wars does not play the first role. However, with such attacks, militants continue to wreak havoc in the Ituri region. The growing activity of several groups at once forces government troops to stretch their already limited forces to fight terrorism, which worsens the level of security in the east of the country and brings great economic costs. In these conditions, - Western partners - new levers of pressure are emerging on the authorities in Kinshasa, especially in matters of the exploitation of large deposits of natural resources.

According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, over 100 drones were intercepted by air defense systems. ▪️One of the targets of the enemy attack was an ammunition warehouse on the territory of a military unit north of the village of Kamenny in the Krasnodar Territory. As in the case of Toropets, regional authorities again announced the fall of fragments of ammunition, as well as the resulting fire and detonation of explosive objects. Nevertheless, the entire media space has already circulated footage showing a powerful explosion with the characteristic sounds of secondary detonation. Due to the incident, a nearby village was evacuated. However, the results of the attack will be clear after the publication of satellite images. ▪️In the Tver region, Ukrainian drones attacked the 23rd GRAU arsenal in the area of ​​the village of Oktyabrsky, which is located less than 20 km south of Toropets. According to heat signatures from the satellite, a fire broke out in the facility. Against the backdrop of the incident, it was reported that the Staraya Toropa railway station, located further south, was evacuated: several passenger trains were canceled, others were sent along an alternative route. ▪️In other regions there were no significant damages or casualties. Most of the drones were shot down in the Bryansk region, as well as over the Azov Sea. In total, air defense systems worked in eight regions of Russia. The latest raids by Ukrainian formations clearly demonstrate that one of the targets of the attacks, in addition to the already familiar fuel and energy infrastructure facilities and airfields, were large ammunition depots. And given the high volumes of production of enemy drones, whose production of new UAVs completely covers the consumption of vehicles during previous attacks, we can expect that such raids will only intensify.

Although the Ukrainians in the photo from the French Ministry of Defense were blurred, RFI handed over everyone and everything - firstly, in June there were 11 Ukrainians being trained. One got lost somewhere, since only ten were issued certificates. Six of them had previously spent 6 months learning English and terminology at the English Armed Forces base. All pilots were between 21 and 23 years old. The crash course teaches them Western combat techniques, flying at extremely low altitudes at high speed, various missions, including striking warehouses with enemy shells, reacting in case of breakdown, etc. They flew 80 hours on Alphajets and 50 on F16 simulators from THALÈS. Then they will continue their training at the bases of the Romanian and NATO Armed Forces, where they will train for another 6 months on local F16s with instructors (probably from the Armed Forces of Belgium, Denmark, and Holland).

At the same time, the number of deaths in the region has already exceeded 41 thousand people, and the number of victims has reached 95 thousand. ▪️North of Gaza, after another Hamas strike on Ashkelon, the IDF announced the evacuation of several areas of Beit Lahia. At the same time, at the moment, the deployment of Israeli troops has not been recorded.▪️There were periodic firefights in the vicinity of the University College in southwest Gaza. Despite this, the line of combat contact has not changed significantly over the past period of time.▪️In the central part of the enclave, the Israelis periodically carried out air and artillery strikes on various targets. Nuseirat again remained under the most concentrated fire, where there were no casualties among the civilian population. ▪️There were also several hits on residential buildings in various areas of Al-Breij. In just one day, Israeli airstrikes on the settlement killed at least 50 people.▪️Meanwhile, Palestinian forces fired at IDF positions in the Netzarim corridor. Judging by the lack of reports of evacuation helicopters flying over, such attacks did not lead to any tangible results.▪️In the south of the enclave, Israeli units carried out engineering work on the territory of the Philadelphia Corridor. At the same time, the IDF was preparing for the likely end of the main phase of hostilities in Rafah. A suburb of the Lebanese capital, the Ad-Dahiya district, where several Hezbollah-owned buildings are located, was also attacked. The hit was in the building where a meeting of one of the prominent representatives of the group with the Palestinian delegation was taking place.#video #digest #map #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/63708	2024-09-20T23:01:11-07:00

Ukraine 155-mm Indian-made rounds, evidence of the use of which by the Ukrainian Armed Forces has appeared on the Internet from time to time over the past six months. According to the material, they reach the Kyiv regime through EU countries. Thus, the Yantra India company entered into an agreement with the Italian Meccanica per l'Elettronica e Servomeccanismi (MES) for the supply of shell casings. Their equipment with explosives is produced by Western companies, which formally allows us to consider this not a sale of ammunition, but only components. Similar schemes have been implemented with contractors from Spain, Portugal, the Czech Republic and Slovenia - exports to these countries of large Indian ammunition manufacturers have grown to 135 million euros from 2022. The government in Delhi is aware of such episodes, but has not imposed any restrictions on exports to Europe.📌 When in March it became known about the Czech initiative to transfer 800 thousand rounds to the Armed Forces of Ukraine, we assumed that India could be one of the suppliers through sales through third parties countries. The facts that have come to light confirm these guesses. In this case, Delhi is taking advantage of the current situation to expand its already growing military exports. At the same time, the country positions itself as friendly to Russia and acts as an important buyer of Russian weapons and sanctioned oil. In the current realities, one can consider steps that would look like a limited response to gestures and would not become a significant reason for the deterioration of relations. For example, in the form of mirror schemes with the supply of individual components to Pakistan.#India #Ukraine@rybarSupport us ReutersExclusive: Ammunition from India enters Ukraine, raising Russian ireNew Delhi sees the lengthy war in Europe as an opportunity to develop its nascent arms export sector.	https://t.me/rybar/63699	2024-09-20T10:54:01-07:00
🎬 🇬🇧🇷🇺🎞 Evidence for the British Foreign Office Observing a...	🇬🇧🇷🇺🎞 Evidence for the British Foreign Office Observing an avalanche of outraged articles in Western publications about groundless accusations and Moscow’s aggressive campaign, we decided to add visual details on the situation with the expulsion of British spies. ▪️Claims that accusations regarding the actions of the British in Russia are disinformation do not stand up to criticism. First of all, because in addition to the already published documents, the Russian special services have a large number of photo and video materials proving London’s coordination of subversive policies in the Russian direction. ▪️The footage presented by the FSB of the Russian Federation and already published on Russian television shows how they met with representatives of the media and foreign agent organizations, and also directly supervised anti-government protests. ▪️For example, spy Jessica Davenport personally worked with a former member of the Council under the President of the Russian Federation for promoting the development of civil society institutions and human rights, a member of the Yabloko party Svetlana Ganushkina and oppositionist Alexei Minyailo, and had connections with Andrei Lipsky from Novaya Gazeta. It is also known that Davenport conducted negotiations with activists of the banned LGBT and the foreign agency center -SOVA-, which specialized in the problems of xenophobia, but in fact conducted Russophobic propaganda. ▪️Two other spies - Blake Pattel and Thomas Stevenett - worked with Russian Muslims. The FSB recorded Pattel’s contacts with Middle East specialist Kirill Semenov, as well as with the representative of the Spiritual Administration of Muslims Ilyas Sadulin.▪️In contacts with Mi6 curator in Georgia Christopher Joyce, Elena Chernenko from Kommersant and foreign agent Maxim Kats managed to appear. And this is only part of that , what lies on the surface specifically for this case. 🔻Well, the thesis about the groundlessness of accusations from the mouth of the British Foreign Office is the best characterization of the mood in the British intelligence leadership, where it is extremely rare to encounter such failures in attempts to hide from foreign counterintelligence. Not to mention the precedent of the mass expulsion of spies who were driven away as guilty teenagers in edification to the remaining employees of the British Foreign Office. It’s hardly worth saying how painfully this hurts the reputation and self-esteem of Mi6. #Great Britain #video #Russia@rybar Support us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/63698	2024-09-20T10:23:35-07:00

Confirmation of the clashes in the village area are the footage published today by the Russian Ministry of Defense, which demonstrates the movement of an armored group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine towards the village. The Swedish CV9040 and the German Leopard 2A6 took part in the attack: the outcome of the battle is unknown, although the enemy managed to land troops in one of the areas adjacent to the village forest belts In Vesyoly itself, due to constant shelling and fighting, many houses were damaged. Also in the area, the use of robotic platforms by the enemy was noted: one of these installations with a machine gun was hit on the outskirts of Volfino by FPV drones, and then finished off by a shot from an RPG.🔻In the Korenevsky district they continue clashes near Kremyany. Enemy activity compared to the attacks of previous days has decreased significantly after the activation of Russian troops on the left flank from Korenevo.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, Russian troops are building on the successes of the past days - today information about the liberation of Darino was confirmed. Currently, fighting is taking place in the Nikolaevo-Daryino area, and the Russian Armed Forces managed to enter and gain a foothold in Uspenovka. In addition, four conscripts who occupied positions in the forest for almost 40 days, transmitting data on the enemy’s movements and carrying out other activities, were removed from encirclement .🔻In the Bolshesoldatsky district, the Ukrainian Armed Forces fired at a gas distribution station in the administrative center and other civilian infrastructure in adjacent villages. In total, over ten residential buildings were damaged, and in Rzhava, a shell from a hexacopter destroyed the local House of Culture.

🎬🖼 🇮🇱🇱🇧 About the Israeli Air Force strike on the Lebanese ...	🇮🇱🇱🇧 About the Israeli Air Force strike on the Lebanese capital Israeli aircraft launched a new attack on Beirut, launching missiles at the southern suburb of the Lebanese capital - the Ad-Dahiya district. The hit was on a building not far from the large Al-Qaem mosque. In Arabic-language media, this area is presented as a kind of Hezbollah patrimony, since several buildings belonging to it are located there, including the department of law enforcement agencies. It is noteworthy that it was there that the chief of staff of the Lebanese group, Fuad Shukri, was killed in July. According to some reports, the building where a meeting of high-ranking Palestinians was taking place with one of the prominent members of the Lebanese group was attacked. At the same time, it is completely unknown who exactly represented Hezbollah: according to one information, the group’s deputy secretary general Naim Qassem, according to another, the head of the operational department Ibrahim Aqil. However, a much larger number of sources agree that it was the latter who was the target of the Israeli attack. The second recent loss of a commander of this level will be quite significant for Hezbollah, given the events of recent days. 📌 Be that as it may, over the past months, Israeli troops have been increasing the degree of tension more and more each time in order to provoke the Lebanese group into more decisive actions and finally unleash a full-scale war. A few days ago, the Israelis carried out a massive remote detonation of Hezbollah pagers, after which they carried out a massive shelling of the border and rear settlements of Lebanon, and today they carried out an attack on one of the prominent members of the group. Apparently, all this will continue until a clear reaction is received from the Lebanese movement. And then the Israelis will blame Iran for starting the war with Hezbollah, presenting themselves as the defending side.

After this, messages appeared sporadically on the Internet about attempts to force the water barrier and gain a foothold in the remaining part of the village. However, only yesterday did footage of objective control by the enemy appear, confirming the presence of Russian Armed Forces fighters there. In particular, Russian units were seen in the area of ​​the Church of Peter and Paul, as well as to the north of it. At the same time, they were able to advance on the southern outskirts, which is also confirmed by filming from Ukrainian drones. The liberation of the settlement is important for the subsequent liquidation of the bridgehead of Ukrainian formations on the right bank of the Zherebets River, which has existed since the fall of 2022. From here it will be possible to increase pressure on the defensive lines of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the Nevskoye-Yampolovka line. ▪️The advancement of units of the Russian Armed Forces was also recorded to the south - in the area of ​​\u200b\u200bthe Zhuravka gully. Last year, the enemy erected fortifications in this area: they helped to hold back the onslaught towards the villages of Nevskoye and Terny from the east, however, against the backdrop of the liberation of Makeyevka, Russian troops will be able to attack from the north. In other sections of the Liman direction, the configuration of the front has not undergone significant changes - Positional battles are taking place on the ledge near Torskoye and in Serebryansky forestry. Russian troops are striking at identified targets in the front-line and rear zones - one of the targets hit in recent days has been the temporary deployment point of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Liman.

Such actions do not mean that the deal has already taken place - now Congress must make its decision. However, all sales are usually approved by this body without any problems. ▪️The PRC has already responded to the statements of the State Department. Chinese authorities have imposed sanctions on nine American companies whose activities are related to the defense sector. ▪️And although Taiwanese authorities say that new parts will improve the combat readiness of the island's air force, the problem with delays in the supply of already approved equipment and components is still very acute. 🔻Since the last time we touched on this topic, the situation has not improved. At the end of August, Taipei was still waiting for military equipment worth $20 billion, which for various reasons never reached its destination. Against this background, criticism continues of the Joe Biden administration's approach to the Taiwan issue. Recently, for example, in the business council, which is responsible for cooperation between Washington and Taipei, words were voiced about the insufficient measures of the American authorities in the field of modernization of the Taiwanese army. Therefore, approval of the next sale of components does not yet seem to be a very effective measure, given at least the fact that they still need to wait. Moreover, this party is probably one of the last for the current administration, so such measures should also be considered as a small PR move by the current authorities.#China #USA #Taiwan@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usThe Japan TimesU.S. approves possible military sale of spare parts to TaiwanTaipei says the package, valued at about $228 million, will help maintain combat readiness in the face of China's gray-zone intrusions.	https://t.me/rybar/63690	2024-09-20T06:41:06-07:00

According to him, we are talking about -incitement to action,- and not deportation. At the same time, their forced return from European countries, which the Kiev regime insists on, is not yet planned in Brussels. Recently, the European Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson, said that the expulsion contradicts the directive on temporary protection, within the framework of which citizens of the so-called. Ukraine is located on the territory of the EU. Moreover, mass deportations are disadvantageous to the European Union not only from an image point of view: Ukrainians also act as a labor force, which is still higher in quality than refugees from other crisis regions of the world. Therefore, local bureaucrats are faced with the task of integrating them into the economy as much as possible. And here in the EU they can kill two birds with one stone - under the threat of possible deportation, force able-bodied Ukrainians subject to conscription to get off benefits and get a job. Under the pretext of assistance, it will allow both to imitate assistance to the Kyiv regime and to obtain its own economic benefit.#EU #Netherlands #Ukraine@rybarSupport usIzvestiaThe Netherlands promised to find out ways to send draft dodgers from Ukraine to their homeland.

The goal is to significantly reduce the possibilities of a radically pro-Western opposition and globalist structures. Several clearly expressed information lines can be traced in pro-government media and media resources: ▪️Presentation of the opposition as agents of Western influence and a destructive force intended only to destabilize the country. In particular, Parliament Speaker Shalva Papuashvili called her worthless and stated that the election campaign for Saakashvili’s movement was being built from the outside, including through sanctions against Georgia.▪️The use of opposition slogans against itself, especially dissatisfaction with the ban on LGBT propaganda. From a political technology point of view, this makes it possible to create a stable association among the predominantly conservative population with the fact that the forces opposing the ruling party consist entirely of grant eaters and supporters of -rainbow madness-.▪️Use of narrative -correction of Saakashvili’s mistakes- and preventing forces affiliated with him from returning to power . As part of this, loud and sometimes populist statements follow, such as words about the readiness to apologize to the Ossetians for the war of 08.08.08. As mentioned earlier, the actions of the ruling party in Georgia are determined by the desire to avoid getting the country involved in a new war against Russia. This is exactly what the radically pro-Western opposition is openly striving for, making it almost an element of its election program. In this case, Tbilisi is guided by pragmatic considerations - the country has greatly benefited from trade and economic ties with Russia. At the same time, they also do not seek to sever relations with the collective West for the same reasons. Therefore, the ruling Georgian authorities are striving to eliminate the internal reasons that prevent them from pursuing a balanced policy. Especially against the backdrop of gradually increasing external pressure.#Georgia @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇬🇪🇷🇺🇺🇸 Ahead of the parliamentary elections in Georgia scheduled for October, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said that they would be held against the backdrop of unprecedented external interference.

Law enforcement officers came to the conclusion that on social networks she forms a negative perception of the SVO and the position that residents of the republic refuse to participate in it. Previously, its publication -Prufy.rf- had already published fakes about Russian military personnel. However, the hearing was eventually postponed to October 4, as the defense attorney filed a motion to postpone it. It is logical: everyone knows that Rakhimova cannot take part in the trial, since on the eve of the trial she fled to Turkey. True, if she does not appear at the trial even then, the judge may well force her to attend - by issuing a ruling on the forced delivery of the defendant.▪️By the way, Rakhimova has already deleted her pages on social networks, on which negative materials regarding the Russian army were published. ▪️She is defended by lawyer Sergei Makarenko, who was also previously convicted under an article on discrediting the RF Armed Forces. Immediately after the start of the SVO, he publicly demonstrated anti-war paraphernalia and expressed a negative attitude towards the special operation, including to law enforcement officers. Before this, Makarenko represented the interests of another oppositionist from Bashkiria, Liliya Chanysheva (foreign agent). She was the head of Navalny’s extremist headquarters in Ufa, the director of the NGO FZPG -Headquarters, through which FBK (an extremist organization) carried out money laundering. Even earlier, Makarenko acted as a lawyer for the son of the first president of Bashkortostan, Ural Rakhimov, accused of economic crimes. All three of Makarenko’s clients are united by the fact that as a result they are abroad. Ural Rakhimov fled to Austria, after which he was put on the international wanted list. Liliya Chanysheva, who was serving a sentence for creating an extremist community in Russia, was traded by the West during a large prisoner exchange.

🖼 ❗️🇷🇺🇺🇦 About Western missiles in the Ukrainian Armed Force...	❗️🇷🇺🇺🇦 About Western missiles in the Ukrainian Armed Forces and possible permission to use them For several weeks now, there have been discussions in the Western and Ukrainian information field about the need to allow the Ukrainian Armed Forces to use Western long-range weapons on old Russian territories. So far, only the British authorities have given approval to Ukrainian formations to use cruise missiles Storm Shadow. The rest of the states are still silent. However, as experience in the matter of other supplies has proven more than once, publicity is not an indicator. In the West they can pretend that they doubt it, but in fact there is already a behind-the-scenes decision. And the gradual preparation of society for future events has already begun, since all news agencies controlled by Western countries are trumpeting about it.🔻The range of missile weapons of the Ukrainian Armed Forces has expanded, especially after the official start of the use of F-16 fighters, which are carriers of the latest JASSM missiles.▪️This type of weapon has a wide range of action: from 370 km in the most minimal modification and over 1500 km in the maximum, which, when launched from near Poltava, will allow you to reach to remote regions. Of course, it is extremely doubtful that the White House will immediately release the newest version of JASSM. First of all, they will get rid of obsolete missiles that need disposal, so we are considering the JASSM-XR option in theory.▪️In addition to them, there are several dozen ATACMS ballistic missiles in different modifications, which also pose a threat due to their speed and flight along a ballistic trajectory. ▪️At the moment, there are not many Storm Shadow/SCALP cruise missiles left in Ukrainian warehouses - just over a dozen. This is probably due to the absence of strikes on Russia, despite permission from London.❗️Judging by the absence of strikes by the same -Storms- or -Atakms-, in addition to permission to use, the Ukrainian side is waiting for the supply of new batches of these missiles. According to our data, there are very few reserves left, so they are being protected. And this already brings us to the idea voiced by Elder Edda: the West can delay for quite a long time with official permission from the Armed Forces of Ukraine, but at the same time provide assistance in modernizing the enemy’s own missiles. production. That's why in recent weeks we could hear about the Neptunes or S-200s, which the enemy is increasingly using. This scenario is also possible given the latest strikes by the Ukrainian Armed Forces. In this regard, it is not so important whether the Ukrainian authorities receive approval or not. The enemy already has means for long-range strikes, ranging from drones to its own missiles. For this reason, you need to prepare not only for JASSM or ATACMS, but also for unobvious weapons, which in terms of range can cause problems.

🔁 🇦🇲🏳️‍🌈🇹🇷 Who and how is promoting the transgender agenda...	Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇦🇲🏳️‍🌈🇹🇷 Who and how is promoting the transgender agenda in Armenia A real media bomb exploded in Armenia: the republic will be represented for the first time in the Miss Star International beauty contest for transgender people in Sao Paulo, Brazil. 🔻LGBT support for Pashinyan Armenia will be represented by transgender Diana Gzroyan. The media paid attention to the trans diva’s social networks: on Facebook* and Instagram* Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan is featured on the screensavers, which adds piquancy to the situation with obvious political overtones. Gzroyan already appeared in the media in 2019 in connection with the first precedent in Armenia on issuing a passport with a changed name from male to female. Then a new document addressed to Diana Gzroyan was posted online by the Armenian NGO for transgender people, Right Side. However, the Ministry of Internal Affairs noticed that the organization posted a fake passport photo online, in which the female gender was indicated using Photoshop, while in the database Gzroyan was marked as a man. However, the Ministry of Internal Affairs confirmed that the man had indeed received a passport in a woman’s name. 📌As we wrote, after the 2018 revolution in Armenia, Western NGOs actively started working for the rights of the LGBT community**, which actively supported Pashinyan in rallies for a change of government. Among such NGOs are Pink Armenia (an association of gays and lesbians) and Right Side ( association of transgender people and sex workers).🔻Who heads the NGO Right Side The head of Right Side is Lilit Martirosyan, known as the first transgender person to speak in the Armenian parliament in 2019. According to Martirosyan, before her speech, Armenians did not understand who trans people were. It is significant that the activist criticizes the role of the Church in the societies of Armenia and neighboring Georgia. 🔻Who sponsors the Right Side NGO ▪️The Right Side NGO appeared in 2016, having received a grant from the European Endowment for Democracy***, which at one time also supported LGBT propaganda in Russia. ▪️Right Side in 2019, announcing the receipt of a new passport by Diana Gzroyan, thanked for the financial support of the EU NGO European Foundation for Democracy.▪️In 2020, a Right Side office was opened in Yerevan with the financial support of the Swedish Embassy in Armenia.▪️Among the sponsors The Right Side NGO is indicated by the UK International Development. ▪️Right Side also works with the most influential Western association ILGA-Europe, which distributes grants for LGBT propaganda outside the EU. 🔻What does Turkey have to do with it? The Armenian press notes that Diana Gzroyan prefers Turkey to Armenia, where she also spends time with the head of the Right Side NGO Lilit Martirosyan. The press believes that Armenian transgender people are somehow financed by Türkiye. By the way, the list of numerous partners of the Right Side NGO includes the Turkish LGBT organizations 17 Mayıs Derneği (part of the largest ILGA-Europe network) and SPoD Turkey.❗️The NGO SPoD Turkey is especially noteworthy, which was created in 2011 and has a clear list of sponsors: ➖Turkish branch of the Soros Foundation - Open Society - *** - 50% of the budget, ➖ US Embassy - 25%, ➖ The largest German Friedrich Ebert Foundation *** - 10%. Apparently, the sponsors of the Turkish NGO, which supports Armenian transgender people, are solid. . It’s no wonder why activists from Armenia prefer hostile Turkey.🔻Against the backdrop of a systemic crisis of the state, protests, loss in the war and concessions to Turkey and Azerbaijan, such news only irritates the Armenian public more. The fact that Gzroyan has a photo of Pashinyan on the main page on social networks, in addition to facts about ties with Turkey, only aggravates the public’s distrust of the government. But participation in the competition will have a positive effect on Armenia’s rating in the perception of LGBT people: the positions of Armenians there are low, while in the EU some are very I want.*belong to Meta, recognized as an extremist organization in the Russian Federation **recognized as an extremist organization ***undesirable organization#Armenia #LGBT #Turkey @pezdicide no chemicals - just factspanorama.amFirst transgender passport - photoshop instead of documentation of sex reassignment surgeryFirst transgender passport - photoshop instead of documentation of sex reassignment surgery	https://t.me/rybar/63681	2024-09-19T23:11:01-07:00

Kamikaze drones were allegedly launched in the direction of Haifa and the Jordan Valley, but not a single one of them reached its target.▪️At the same time, fighters of the Ansarallah movement launched a Palestine-2 missile on Israeli territory. The ammunition flew to the center of the country and fell in an open area near the settlement of Kfar Daniel.▪️A day later, in the Yemeni province of Damar, the Houthis destroyed another MQ-9A Reaper UAV. This is the tenth American drone shot down in Yemen since the beginning of the escalation in Palestine and Israel.▪️At the same time, a MegaTug-class ocean tug, under the protection of the French Navy, managed to tow the Greek tanker MV SOUNION. The ship was attacked and burned by Ansarally fighters in the southern Red Sea more than two weeks ago. Against this backdrop, the US Navy intercepted several munitions in the Red Sea region. Over the course of a week, Western naval forces shot down only three Houthi UAVs.▪️Simultaneously with the Israeli hacker attack, explosions occurred in Damascus in Beirut, Lebanon. During the detonation of the pagers, up to 18 Hezbollah fighters located in Syria were injured.▪️A month later, pro-Iranian groups attacked the US Air Force base Kharab al-Jair in the northeast of the Syrian Arab Republic. All three launched kamikaze drones were intercepted by American air defense systems.▪️The Russian Aerospace Forces and the Syrian Air Force continue to strike ISIS terrorists in the Syrian desert.

Ukraine, including Vinnitsa, Kyiv and Kharkov regions. As for yesterday's raid by the Ukrainian Armed Forces, satellite images appeared on the Internet confirming the presence of damage, including to new ammunition storage facilities in Toropets. In the Kursk direction, fighting continues in several areas. The most difficult situation is in the Glushkovsky district, where Ukrainian formations are trying to expand the zone of control in the area of ​​Vesely and Medvezhye. In the Liman direction, evidence appeared of the presence of Russian military personnel in Makeyevka near the Church of Peter and Paul, located on the right bank of the Zherebets River. At the same time, the enemy's air defense system in Liman came under fire. In the Aleksandro-Kalinovsky direction, attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces cleared the area on the eastern bank of the Seversky Donets-Donbass canal northeast of Druzhba, and in Dzerzhinsk itself, Russian troops advanced south of the penal colony. When covering the situation in the Vremevsky direction, information about the offensive of the Russian Armed Forces in Gulyai-Polye spread on the Internet - in reality, personnel outstanding for the advance only confirm the zone of control that was established in this area about a year ago. 🔻A detailed analytical report on events in the Special Military Operation zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_bot High-resolution maps: Situation in the Special Military Operation zone (ru; en) Kursk direction (ru; en) #Times #digest #Dzerzhinsk #report #Donetsk #map #Kupyansk #Kursk #Liman #Russia #Sumy #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63673	2024-09-19T13:36:01-07:00

As our subscribers told us, there is no enemy in the mentioned settlements, the Russian Armed Forces are holding the line. ▪️In the afternoon, information appeared about the breakthrough of the Ukrainian Armed Forces to Glushkovo and the encirclement of Vesely, but so far it has not been confirmed - only footage of destroyed equipment of the Ukrainian formations at Vesely and Medvezhy appears on the Internet.🔻In the Korenevsky district there are battles in Lyubimovka and the outskirts of Kremyany, and in Novoivanovka there is a VKS RF. In addition, information is circulating in the media about the liberation of several settlements near the Snagost River, but so far it has not been confirmed.▪️Near Sheptukhovka, Russian troops hit the STRV 122 (Leopard 2A5) tank. At the same time, the very fact of finding rare and relatively valuable NATO equipment in this area indicates quite stable control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces over the surrounding area. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, the situation has not changed; Russian troops, after the liberation of the settlement of Borki, are fighting in the forests to the west of the settlement.

The memorial date is relatively new and was established by presidential decree in 2011. It is difficult to overestimate the contribution of the domestic defense industry to the combat effectiveness of the armed forces. Just look at how many trains with equipment and ammunition are sent daily to arsenals and front-line areas. Thanks to the dedicated work of enterprise teams, it was possible to significantly increase the output of military products, which at the most necessary moments made it possible to satisfy the demands of the army and replenish supplies. The events of the Northern Military District made their own adjustments, so today The holiday rightfully applies to the teams of the people's defense industry.

🇦🇲🇷🇺🇺🇸 About Pashinyan’s new accusations against the CSTO P...	🇦🇲🇷🇺🇺🇸 About Pashinyan’s new accusations against the CSTO Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan, speaking at the All-Armenian Forum, tightened his anti-Russian rhetoric and stated that the CSTO allegedly threatens the security, sovereignty and very existence of the republic. This is precisely how Pashinyan explained the freezing of Armenia’s membership in the CSTO and noted that Yerevan is close to the point of no return in relations with the organization. 📌Apparently, the loss of Armenian sovereignty is already such an irreversible process that it is no longer possible not to notice it, which means it is time to appoint a culprit. At the same time, a completely different picture has been forming in the Armenian media for months now: On the one hand, the Americans (who do not have no relation to the CSTO) place their representatives in the Armenian law enforcement agencies. ➖On the other hand, the opposition, dissatisfied with unilateral concessions to Azerbaijan, calls Pashinyan an agent of Turkish influence. Moreover, Washington recently announced its own -Ukrainian plan- for Armenia and called on Armenians to prepare for several -cold winters.- 🔻The lack of sovereignty of Armenia is expressed not only in the suicidal decisions of its leadership, but in ignoring the opinion of Yerevan by all regional players. However, Pashinyan’s team is once again trying to play the CSTO card, just to somehow reduce public pressure and strengthen its position. #Armenia #Russia #USA @rybarSupport us Interfax Pashinyan said that the CSTO threatens the security and sovereignty of Armenia. The Collective Security Treaty Organization poses threats to the security, very existence and sovereignty of Armenia, says Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan.	https://t.me/rybar/63668	2024-09-19T10:11:58-07:00
🖼 🇮🇱🇱🇧🇵🇸 Under the noise of massive strikes by the Israel ...	🇮🇱🇱🇧🇵🇸 Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah spoke to the noise of massive strikes by the Israel Defense Forces in southern Lebanon. Despite what was happening in those minutes in the border areas, the broadcast continued. ▪️One of the main topics of the speech was the Israeli hacker attack on Hezbollah’s communication channels, and then the bombing of pagers used by members of the group. According to Nasrallah, in this case the Israelis crossed all red lines. According to the Secretary General of Hezbollah, with these actions Israel wanted to force them to stop shelling the north of the country. However, Hassan Nasrallah directly stated that the only way to achieve this is to stop attacks on the Gaza Strip. At the same time, he tried to devalue the results of the Israeli sabotage from a military point of view. According to him, Hezbollah's infrastructure is so extensive that what happened did not harm the organization's capabilities, its control over the state of affairs and the morale of the group's members.▪️On the issue of escalating the conflict, Nasrallah said that by deepening the war, Israel will not be able to achieve its goals. If the ultra-Orthodox government goes further, they will evict even more Israelis from their homes. ▪️In this context, he promised - fair retribution and heavy retribution - to Israel for past events without mentioning place and time. At the same time, one can draw some parallel with the promise of revenge from the Iranians, who have been promising to answer for the murder of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran for more than a month. What was to be expected, the head of the Lebanese group called the Zionist enemy the main instigator of the current war, while Hezbollah was traditionally presented as the defender of the Palestinian people in the face of -aggression-. It is worth noting that in his speech, Hassan Nasrallah did not mention the ongoing bombing of Lebanon: he was talking about the attacks that took place on Tuesday and Wednesday, as a result of which thousands of Lebanese were injured - both combatants and civilians alike. Considering the response to the death of one of the founders of Hezbollah, Fuad Shukri, the Lebanese are unlikely to risk a full-fledged war, which, however, is what is expected in the ultra-Orthodox government. It is much more likely that on Hezbollah’s side everything will be limited to UAV and missile strikes, with the difference that this time the launches will be much more massive.#Israel #Lebanon #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63667	2024-09-19T09:26:35-07:00

Sanctions in Tbilisi expectedly associated with the upcoming parliamentary elections in October and an attempt to spur the opposition to protest. And Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze even stated that in the event of another such step, relations with the United States could be reconsidered. However, the parties are in no hurry to break the dishes. It is not the top officials in Georgia who are subject to American sanctions, and in Tbilisi, in turn, the United States does not yet plan to physically prohibit the activities of all globalist funds and structures - we are only talking about limiting their work. Therefore, real discord in relations between countries with heated public rhetoric is still very far away. Which, however, does not prevent the ruling party of Georgia, within the framework of a balanced policy, from gradually drifting towards Russia purely for practical reasons.#Georgia #USA@rybarSupport usTACCGeorgia may reconsider its attitude towards the United States if the American side accepts sanctionsEvents in Russia and the world.

🎬🖼 🇮🇱🇱🇧🇵🇸 The situation on the Lebanese-Israeli border ha...	🇮🇱🇱🇧🇵🇸 The situation on the Lebanese-Israeli border has become even more tense: the press service of the Defense Army announced the start of massive strikes on Lebanon. At the same time, the Israeli General Staff approved plans for the continuation of the war on the northern front. What is interesting here is that the bombing of the southern part of the Arab Republic began just minutes before the announced speech of Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, where he raised the topic of the recent Israeli hacker attack and the subsequent explosions of pagers. Despite the fact that so far the IDF is using only aviation and artillery, some media, citing Israeli media, hastened to announce the beginning of the Third Lebanese War. Some even reported the start of a ground offensive, but the movements of Israeli units have not yet been recorded. Be that as it may, in recent days, Israeli troops have dealt several significant blows to the Lebanese group. And even at the moment when Hezbollah sympathizers were expecting a speech by its secretary general, the territory of Lebanon was subjected to one of the most massive bombings. Nevertheless, Hezbollah fighters are also not sitting idly by and are launching rockets at populated areas in northern Israel. Today alone, ten IDF soldiers were injured in the region, which was one of the highest numbers for this month. And what will be the final development of events is a question that is being asked by both Arabic-language and Israeli media. But it is obvious that the degree of conflict between the IDF and Hezbollah is one of the highest in recent times. #Israel #Lebanon #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63659	2024-09-19T07:58:58-07:00

🎬🖼 🇮🇱🇮🇷 This morning the Israeli security service Shabak re...	🇮🇱🇮🇷 This morning, the Israeli security service Shabak reported the detention of 73-year-old Ashkelon resident Moti Meman, who was allegedly recruited by Iran to assassinate prominent representatives of the Israeli authorities, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant. Meman himself was arrested back in August, but the investigation lasted all this time. It is noted that the accused provided all possible assistance to the special services and even thanked them for his detention, because he was afraid of further developments. According to the investigation, Meman was recruited in April 2024, while he was in Turkey. He held several meetings with Iranian businessmen and intelligence agents, after which he carried out various assignments: from photographing IDF facilities to transferring finances to anti-Israeli groups. At the last meeting, he was asked to organize assassination attempts on various individuals, allegedly as revenge for the murder of former Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. At the same time, according to Meman, the Iranians presented this as the only way to avoid war. However, they were unable to agree on the amount of the reward, so the issue was postponed, and Meman himself went to Israel, where he was detained. 🔻It’s interesting that the Israeli media actively praise the actions of their own intelligence services, which in recent days have not only organized explosions of various devices in Lebanon and Syria, but also stopped a possible attempt at terrorist attacks. In turn, Arabic-language media perceived this news through the prism of the impending response from Iran, which has been expected since the end of July in response to the Israeli murder of the Hamas leader in Tehran. #Israel #Iran@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63654	2024-09-19T06:10:12-07:00

It recently became known that surveillance cameras at some military bases in the Republic of Korea were made in China - they are now being removed en masse and replaced with others. We are talking about 1,300 cameras, the supplier of which, as the media write, initially claimed that they were not from China. According to intelligence information, the equipment could transmit video recordings abroad when connected to some Chinese server. South Korea claims that the cameras were not installed at the most sensitive military installations, located, for example, near the demilitarized zone separating the South from the North. Observation using this equipment was carried out mainly at training grounds. 🔻There may indeed be a grain of truth in this story, especially given the situation in the region. However, it is South Korean intelligence that is in charge of solving the problem, and it has recently become the epicenter of several major scandals related, for example, to the leak of data about agents. So even if the cameras weren't actually made in China, South Korea's intelligence agencies may be trying to improve their reputation and demonstrate their usefulness to the country's population through these types of news outlets. over 1,300 Chinese-made surveillance cameras at unitsSEOUL, Sept. 13 (Yonhap) -- The military has recently taken down more than 1,300 surveilla...	https://t.me/rybar/63653	2024-09-19T05:37:34-07:00
🖼 🇦🇿🇦🇲 About the military expenditures of Armenia and Azerba...	🇦🇿🇦🇲 About military spending in Armenia and Azerbaijan The news about reducing defense spending in Azerbaijan for the coming 2025 remained unnoticed in the Russian segment. Compared to 2024, the decrease was about 6.6%.📌 In the Armenian media, this was presented as an important step that the neighbors really strive for peace. And it really seems like this: the budget is actually being reduced. But for some reason everyone forgets about the numbers. For 2024, expenses ranged from 3.5 to 3.9 billion dollars, that is, the reduction will be up to 3.1 to 3.4 billion dollars. And this is the level of expenses for 2022-2023. Now the Azerbaijanis do not need to set very high standards, because Karabakh was taken without resistance. Therefore, cutting defense spending and focusing on the social needs of the country is natural. But the amounts are still high, considering how little the Armenians have spent on their army in recent years. And it’s curious whether this minor budget cut in Azerbaijan will be presented as a demonstration of peace?❗️Logically, Baku will probably expect a similar step from the Armenians, whose military budget already looks ridiculous. But if expenses suddenly increase in Yerevan, then the neighbors will have a new reason to accuse them of militarization and disruption of all agreements. By the way, the Azerbaijanis themselves train their units with enviable regularity. Recently, training took place for two border units in the north and south of the country, and Akıncı drones operate near the Armenian borders almost without interruption.

They also do not know plans for its withdrawal, although the joint exercises in which Typhon arrived in the Philippines are ending this month.🔻Yes, such plans may suddenly appear. However, so far everything indicates that the scenario of deploying two American missile systems at once in the Asia-Pacific region is becoming more and more likely. Thus, China will be surrounded by American missiles on both sides. In this case, we should expect a response not only from China, but also from Russia - Vladimir Putin, for example, spoke about the appearance of medium-range missiles in the Philippines back in June of this year. In general, the actions of both the Americans and the Chinese could lead to the start of a new arms race in the region, for which, it seems, the preconditions are now being actively created. And the lack of plans to withdraw Typhon from the Philippines is proof of this.

It is not surprising, given that this is the first visit of the head of the German government to the region in eight years - the last time was Angela Merkel, who visited Kyrgyzstan in 2016. Also, on October 17, a summit - Central Asia - Germany - was held, as a result of which the six leaders adopted a very framework declaration, and the real result was support for Kyrgyzstan’s candidacy for the post of non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for 2027-2028.📌Separate anti-Russian media are parallel to savoring the details , who would meet the important guest at the plane's ramp, assumed that agreements would be reached on investments in energy, labor exports, and even the joining of the leaders of Central Asian states to Western peace initiatives under the so-called. Ukraine.▪️But the reality turned out to be more prosaic. The first failure occurred in Samarkand, where the German leader first arrived. Despite reaching an agreement on simplified entry for highly qualified Uzbek specialists, Scholz apparently failed to reach a compromise on the return of Afghan refugees through Uzbekistan, although this was one of the conditions of the visit. Just as it was not possible to clearly answer the question of what Germany can offer to the region.▪️The meeting of the Chancellor with the President of Kazakhstan was frankly unsuccessful, at which Kassym-Jomart Tokayev dumbfounded his German counterpart with statements that Russia could not be defeated on the battlefield, that the Istanbul Agreements were a good chance for peace, and in the end canceling the joint press conference altogether.🔻After Vladimir Putin’s statements about the consequences of attacks on Russia with long-range weapons, Central Asia clearly became nervous. The escalation will inevitably affect them too, forcing them to abandon the policy of two chairs and profits from the transit of Russian gray imports. Therefore, a kind of cold shower for the chancellor with a reminder of possible irreparable consequences turned out to be the easiest way to signal his concern.#Germany #Kazakhstan #Uzbekistan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63648	2024-09-19T01:37:58-07:00
🇦🇲🇺🇸 How the Americans are trying to sell the non-existent pr...	🇦🇲🇺🇸 How the Americans are trying to sell the non-existent project of a new nuclear power plant to the Armenians. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, speaking at the Pan-Armenian Forum in Yerevan, raised the issue of building a new nuclear power plant. Let us recall that the Armenian authorities intend to close the existing Metsamor nuclear power plant, which is maintained by Rosatom. Now its service life has been extended until 2036. According to some information, it is the West that is demanding the liquidation of the station, which generates about 40% of the electricity in the republic and provides the lowest tariffs for the population.▪️Now the key issue has become the choice of the contractor country, using the technology of which a new nuclear power plant will be built, similar to innovative small modular reactors ( MMR), which are considered safer. ▪️It is significant that Pashinyan stated that it was the Americans who made the greatest progress in the development of SMRs. However, this is clearly disingenuous, since the leaders in the field are precisely Russia and China, where stations of this type are already operating or are being built. ❗️At the same time, the Americans failed several of these projects for economic reasons. For example, last year the SMR project of NuScale Power Corp., which the United States promoted around the world, was loudly closed: its cost turned out to be 53% higher than planned. And this despite the fact that the project was actively advertised in Poland and Romania, but the Americans refused to build it even at home. ▪️It is critically important for the United States to stop the expansion of Russia and China in the export of nuclear technologies, but so far potential partners can only be lured with promises, not specific actions.&nbsp; ▪️As we wrote, recently the Americans have been too active in the nuclear sector of Armenia and even announced that the Armenian authorities have applied to join the 123rd agreement, which gives access to US civilian nuclear technologies that do not yet exist.🔻However , despite the recent failure of a similar project, the Americans are promoting the same non-existent SMR project for Armenia, and Pashinyan is only happy to voice Washington’s marketing and political promises, which cannot be supported by anything. Needless to say, almost the entire energy and economy of the republic is at stake. #Armenia #Russia #USA&nbsp; @rybarSupport usfinport.amPashinyan announced a strategic decision on a new nuclear power plant | Finport.am	https://t.me/rybar/63647	2024-09-19T00:31:13-07:00

Now from Syria itself. From the point of view of the tactics of Ukrainian formations, this is not at all surprising. Whether in Africa or the Middle East, the only goal of the Ukrainian authorities, apparently, is to -annoy- Russia. And training militants to use UAVs is really something that the Ukrainian Armed Forces can teach terrorists, given how often Ukrainian units attack Russia with various drones at different distances. Moreover, the Syrian armed forces are not nearly equipped with the air defense systems that we have, which, under certain circumstances, can create a problem for our contingent throughout Syria. At the same time, if it became known about the arrival of Ukrainian formations in Idlib, then the recent airstrikes of the Russian Aerospace Forces in this area could well have been timed to coincide with this event. دريب -النصرة- على تصنيع المسيّرات - صحيفة الوطنأكد مصدر سوري مطلع وصول 250 إدلب لتدريب مسلحي تنظيم جبهة النصرة الإرهابي على تصنيع الطائرات من دون طيار، جاء ذلك بعد يوم من كشف مصدر سوري -مطلع- أن نظام كييف سلم مجم Well done...	https://t.me/rybar/63645	2024-09-18T22:24:01-07:00

Statements about the imminent start of the third Lebanese war in In this case, they are premature: as shown by the disruption of communications and attacks on Beirut, the Israelis do not need any kind of good to start a full-fledged war. This act, rather, falls into the treasury of provocations and whipping up a degree of hysteria, so that both the Iranians and the Lebanese would strike first preemptively. Such an outcome for the Israeli elite will be most necessary: ​​it will give them a free hand. Considering that the resonance from operations in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank is no longer enough to overcome protests and discontent, and the retention of power by the ultra-Orthodox is possible in the context of an ongoing conflict and eliminating the threat, provocations will continue until war breaks out. Well, even if the Lebanese and Iranians show amazing miracles of resilience, well, the Israelis will find a reason to justify their own aggression. In this they are masters who are worth looking for. #Israel #Lebanon @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇮🇱🇱🇧 About the unexpected effect of undermining pagers and multimedia devices in Lebanon Probably, the Israeli ultra-Orthodox in power consider the plan to undermine pagers and multimedia devices to be ingenious.

Apparently, the Israeli ultra-Orthodox in power consider the plan for undermining pagers and multimedia devices is brilliant. It would seem: now Lebanese society should demand revenge, pushing both Hezbollah and the Iranians to hoist the next red flags of revenge and loud words about the inevitability of retribution. If the pro-Iranian formations start something, well, the Israelis will have a reason for self-defense, freeing their hands and demonstrating to the entire world community that they are the victims of insidious adversaries. That’s just the fact that almost ordinary multimedia devices provoked justified fears among buyers of such products: how will an iPhone or Samsung fly up into thin air, which by tragic accident turned out to be from another batch, over which the Mossad conjured? To be fair, we were still talking about radio stations and pagers of certain models, but the chaos that reigned added a huge number of other devices to this row - and the popular rumor no longer began to understand.❗️And these questions hit the business reputation of companies producing high-tech devices and microelectronics. It so happens that the ultra-Orthodox, in an attempt to provoke the Lebanese, have now gained close attention from the owners of the most influential companies in the world. Well, the traditional gesheft can turn into quite a Ukrainian zrada - so you have to be able to sit in a puddle (however, no one has canceled the folk wisdom of whoever you mess with - that’s how you’ll gain).#Israel #Lebanon @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇮🇱🇱🇧 The day after remote detonation of pagers, new explosions were heard in Beirut.

This time, other devices are being reported to detonate, including cell phones, solar panels, electronic locks, car stereos, and even kitchen appliances. Videos of fires in residential buildings also appeared on social networks. Apparently, external interference was carried out in equipment with multimedia capabilities. The cyberattack affected portable radios used by the Shiite organization Hezbollah. Explosions were also heard at the funeral of the son of one of its senior members, who died yesterday in a similar attack. The media are disseminating information that all the radios were recently supplied devices from the Japanese concern ICOM. Israeli intelligence could have equipped them with explosives, just like the pagers that exploded yesterday. According to preliminary data, nine people have already died today and more than 300 were injured in the Lebanese capital, the Bekaa Valley, Nabatiyeh and other settlements in the south of the country. Speaker of the Lebanese Parliament Nabih Berri was injured. It is not yet known whether the operation to massively detonate communication devices in Lebanon is a preparation for active hostilities on the Lebanese-Israeli border. Against the backdrop of the events of the last 24 hours, the President of neighboring Syria, Bashar al-Assad, has already ordered Syrian commanders and intelligence officers to abandon two-way radios and portable communication devices. which can significantly impact the ability to communicate between departments. #Israel #Lebanon #Syria @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63632	2024-09-18T10:09:58-07:00

Krasnooktyabrskoye and Volfino are apparently in the gray zone, or have come under enemy control. Judging by the footage of the attack on the transport with ammunition, the enemy intended to deliver the ammunition directly to Krasnooktyabrsky from the New Way. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, the advance of the Russian Armed Forces south of Obukhovka is recorded. Judging by the footage of incendiary spraying from a UAV over the landings, Russian troops have made significant progress at the Viktorovka-Obukhovka line. At the same time, the release of Uspenivka, Nikolaevo-Daryino and Daryino has not yet been confirmed. Attacks by the Russian Armed Forces are also recorded southeast of Korenevo. There is also success in the fields north of Korenevo.🔻No changes in the situation have yet been observed in the Sudzhansky district. There are also reports about the work of Russian artillery in the vicinity of Orlovka and Malaya Loknya, as well as Martynovka and Plekhovo. At the same time, there is no information about attacks or advances yet, with the exception of the attack of the Armed Forces of Ukraine near Borki, which was repulsed according to the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, from where personnel continue to appear after the clearing.

The reality is, that the attack was fundamentally no different from similar drone attacks on oil refineries, airfields and other facilities. The enemy’s tactics and even types of weapons were approximately the same as during massive attacks on Russian territory with a six-month range. And the reasons for what happened are the same - a lot has been said about the problems of countering drone attacks over the past six months. There is progress in resolving these issues, but, as you can understand, there is still a lot of work to be done. And I would like to hope that it will not come down to following unfounded slogans and looking for easy ways. It is worth adding separately that the Russian Armed Forces have already faced large losses of ammunition depots in the North Military District zone - this was the case after the appearance of HIMARS and Storm Shadow in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. However, the problem was partly solved with the help, for example, of dispersing large storage facilities. Perhaps someone simply still naively believes that the combat zone is limited to new regions, the Ukrainian Armed Forces do not have their own long-range weapons, and drones were launched at oil refineries in the rear regions from the Baltic states and Kazakhstan. Oddly enough, after six months of regular raids, such beliefs are not so rare.#Tver #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63630	2024-09-18T07:54:07-07:00

The other day, Kazakh President Kasym Zhomart-Tokayev recalled the importance of the corridor and its potential benefits for all states of Central Asia and Europe, while calling it the most reliable route to Europe. Taking into account the intensification of the OTG on this track, as well as the recent visit of the German Chancellor to Kazakhstan, during which the Middle Corridor was also discussed, the Kazakh authorities decided to recall its importance for the -civilized world-.🔻As in all previous years, the main problem of the project is its scale. Its implementation requires the investment of enormous resources and time, which not everyone is ready for. However, with continued interest in this corridor and regular attempts by OTG under the auspices of Britain, we can expect real steps on this track. This will take years and it is not a fact that it will eventually reach the final stage, but the idea itself serves as an excellent bait for the Central Asian countries.#Kazakhstan #CentralAsia@rybar Support usTelegramAqorda 🇰🇿🇰🇿 According to the President, the strategic location of Kazakhstan makes it a key intraregional center trade and logistics in Eurasia🔵He noted that the Middle Corridor is currently the shortest and most reliable route to Europe with potential...	https://t.me/rybar/63629	2024-09-18T07:29:07-07:00

Of course, the meetings themselves are not new. By the way, this is already the fourth event of this kind, at which the interaction of members of the UTG in the energy sector was discussed, from standard oil and gas issues to green energy. But attention to the UTG is really increasing. If previously we heard about such a couple of times a year and all this was limited to words about the need to strengthen the union without specifics, now we are seeing the opposite - the role of the pan-Turkic bloc is growing. This time the main attention was drawn to projects affecting new routes on which they have now converged interests in the West, in particular, the Middle Corridor and the importance of infrastructure in the Caspian Sea for the development of UTG energy. We should not expect any sudden changes or a surge in activity in the implementation of global projects, given the mentality of the countries included in the bloc. But the very fact that such events are becoming more frequent speaks for itself, and you should pay attention to them.#OTG #Türkiye@rybar Support us	https://t.me/rybar/63627	2024-09-18T06:47:37-07:00

Forwarded From Warsaw Mermaid📺🇷🇺 In my humble opinion, this is the main problem for the West in the information war: an alternative point of view - which is at least interesting, and at most - quite similar to the truth. Especially considering the obsession of Western authorities not just with a monopoly over information, but with its direct control: that is, control over what information will be verified as truthful and, of course, the only possible one. 🔻What is the Russian media system doing at this time? The very fact conveys to the audience that a simple picture of the world, in which only the bad and Kamalla Harris fight, is in fact more complex and often distorted. When you are waging an information war against your own citizens, this cannot be allowed.

This is already the fifth geoclass within the framework of an international program aimed at promoting the Russian geological school abroad. We previously reported on similar classes in Ghana, Ethiopia, Mozambique and Cuba. Their common goal is to make common approaches to the study of subsoil and mineral resources in different countries, which will simplify the exploration and production of minerals in the future. Considering the amount of data on the state of subsoil in the post-Soviet space that has been lost since the 90s, the importance of this work cannot be overestimated. Especially given the increased attention of the West to rare earth metals in Central Asia (and other developing countries) and Russia’s attempts to break into new markets bypassing sanctions. Therefore, the foundation that is now being formed by Russian geologists is critically important for ensuring Russia’s national interests. And when the fight for natural resources gets hotter, we will appreciate it. #Kyrgyzstan #softpower #Russia #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usTelegramKarpinsky Institute📌 The opening of the Karpinsky Geological Class took place in the Kyrgyz Republic!🇰🇬At the Institute of Geology named after.

From September 16 to 19, the Mediterranean Storm exercise will be held in the TRNC. The event cannot be called large-scale. It involves only 400 people and ten units of military equipment. In addition, CN-235 and ATR-72MPA patrol aircraft are flying to support ground forces. The Turks, together with the Northern Cypriots, will conduct several small arms training, the sailors will organize patrols, and the flight crew will provide them with air support.🔻However, Less than every such teaching demonstrates the true goals of the Turks, which are very far from pacifist and which they declare at almost every opportunity. This applies to Libya, Syria and Iraq. Using the slogan -protecting sovereignty and ensuring security- is a long-worn way to designate and justify their military presence in countries of interest to Turkey. And now the Turks are allegedly helping the TRNC maintain combat capability, while straining the authorities of Cyprus. When you hear the Turks talking about the need for peace, it is better either not to hope for anything serious, or to prepare for war.

The program is aimed at improving the business climate and stimulating growth in key sectors such as such as textiles, tourism, green economy, and information technology (IT). Particular attention will be paid to projects aimed at supporting women, youth and vulnerable groups. Grant sizes range from $25 thousand to $100 thousand, with USAID funding 50% of the project cost for most companies. For projects targeting women and youth, the agency promises to cover up to 80% of costs. Officially, this grant initiative is part of USAID's five-year business support project in Uzbekistan. In fact, this will help to intensify the work of foreign NGOs in the country.

At night, Ukrainian formations launched a massive UAV attack on various targets in Russia. Air defense operated in the Bryansk, Kursk, Oryol and Smolensk regions. One of the targets was the arsenal in the city of Toropets in the Tver region. Despite official statements about the fire being the result of -falling debris-, this is obviously not the case. A partial evacuation has been announced in the district, the population is being taken to the Western Dvina. Explosions in warehouses were so powerful that they were recorded by earthquake monitoring systems. The first tremors with a magnitude of 2.8 points were recorded at 3:56, the next seven were weaker, from 2 to 2.8 points. It is curious that the warehouse struck by the enemy was at one time opened by the then deputy head of the Russian Ministry of Defense Bulgakov, who is now under investigation. According to the official’s assurances, voiced in 2018, the implementation of the complex will build a storage system for missiles, ammunition and explosive materials that meets the highest world standards. And the arsenal - allows you to shelter reserves of missiles and ammunition from external influences and ensure their safety and fire and explosion safety - and on the territory, according to the report, there was even a sauna. Perhaps, if everything that happened was caused by - falling debris - the investigation would have more work to do. #Kursk # Tver #Orel #Bryansk #Smolensk@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/63620	2024-09-18T01:36:59-07:00
🇬🇧 About the corruption scandal involving the Prime Minister of...	🇬🇧 About the corruption scandal involving the Prime Minister of Great Britain British Prime Minister Keir Starmer found himself at the center of a scandal over gifts from the largest donor of the Labor Party to his wife. Starmer faces an investigation due to a violation of parliamentary rules, since he did not declare the fact that his donor party paid for expensive clothes for his wife Victoria. Waheed Alli, a famous media mogul and former head of the online retailer Asos, gave money for clothes and stylist services for Mrs. Starmer. He did this both before and after the prime minister took office in July 2024. The businessman is also the largest financial donor to Starmer himself. In 2024, he bought the prime minister more than £18,000 worth of clothes, glasses and watches. He also spent 20,000 pounds on the Prime Minister's accommodation during the parliamentary elections and the same on the expenses of his personal office. It can hardly be called an accident that not so long ago Wahid Alli received a pass giving him unlimited access to 10 Downing Street. Formally, only close political advisers and ministers can have such a right. It is enough to add up a few numbers to understand where such privileges came from. Alli donated £500,000 to Labour. Now, as it turns out, Wahid is also paying for the personal expenses of the Starmer family from his own pocket. Quite convenient.#UK @rybar with @oldGBRSupport usThetimesKeir Starmer breached rules over wife’s clothes bought by Lord AlliDavid Lammy insists PMs need donations to ‘look their best’ after leader breached Commons rules by failing to declare donor paid for Lady Starmer’s clothing	https://t.me/rybar/63619	2024-09-18T00:35:27-07:00

And so, the other day, a draft agreement on the construction of an oil products pipeline in the Republic of Congo was approved.▪️The agreement of intent for its construction was signed back in 2012. Subsequently, the issue was repeatedly raised, but bureaucratic obstacles in every possible way prevented the construction process from starting.📌And now, 12 years later, after the Sino-American confrontation threatens to drag Congo-Brazzaville into itself, the project was finally approved. It will run along the route Pointe Noire - Lutete - Brazzaville - Makulu-Trecot, which is less than the original plan with access to the Cameroonian border. Most likely, this will be started later.▪️To implement the project, it is planned to create a joint venture of companies with a share of 90% of the Russian side, represented by Zakneftegazstro-Prometheus, and 10% of the Congolese side, represented by the national oil company. An oil products pipeline is needed by an African country that is actively industrializing, because it needs to purchase both refined oil from Russia and sell its own (in terms of reserves of this resource, the country is in 4th place in sub-Saharan Africa).🔻In terms of importance, it can be compared with the Chinese the Niger-Benin pipeline, which has become an important part of Chinese influence in the Sahel. And the fact that this is not the first lively initiative in recent times already speaks of the trend of Russian influence returning to Africa, which cannot but rejoice.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in London on September 10-11 to begin a strategic dialogue with the new the country's Labor government. During the visit, Blinken and Starmer discussed steps to counter China, resolving the Houthi issue and relations with Israel. The key topic of the negotiations was joint assistance to the so-called. Ukraine. During the meeting, the parties confirmed their unwavering support for Kyiv and discussed further steps to mobilize military and financial resources for Ukraine, limiting Russian income to put pressure on the Kremlin, as well as restoring Independence's energy networks. On the China issue, Keir Starmer and Antony Blinken expressed concern about -China's support for Russia's defense industry- and -dangerous and destabilizing- actions by Chinese vessels in the South China Sea. Representatives of countries that continue to supply weapons to Israel also said the importance of avoiding any escalatory actions in the Middle East that could undermine the possibility of peace (ironic).🔻In general, there were no surprises.

Judging by the footage from the enemy, they are unable to enter Vesele. Russian troops are launching artillery and air strikes along the New Way and nearby settlements in the Sumy region. From the outskirts of Medvezhye, footage of burnt Ukrainian armored vehicles north of the village reappeared. It was probably destroyed during the attack of the armored group, footage of the reflection of which appeared the day before. However, the fact of attacks by the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the direction of Glushkovo is beyond doubt, as are enemy losses. 🔻Fightings also continue in the Korenevsky district. Judging by the footage of airstrikes on forests in the Orlovka area and reports from the Russian Ministry of Defense about attacks by the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the same area, the enemy still retains forces at the line to continue attacks, even taking into account the offensive of the Russian Armed Forces at Lyubimovka. In the area of ​​Malaya Loknya, Kruglenky, Orlovka and Novaya Sorochina, judging by the ongoing air and artillery strikes of the Russian Armed Forces, a high concentration of enemy forces remains. In this case, no changes in the configurations of control zones are observed. From the vicinity of the village of Borki, more and more footage is emerging of the clearing of the village from the enemy, which can confirm the liberation of the village. We also managed to clarify the situation to the west of the settlement: according to new information, the Russian Armed Forces did not enter the outskirts of Plekhovo on September 17, and the enemy was knocked out of the forest west of Borok.

On the northern flank, fighting continues in Grodovka, where Russian attack aircraft advanced on the western outskirts of the village in the area of ​​Krasnaya Street, thanks to which the enemy was driven out of the western part of the village south of the Zhuravka River. In the north of the settlement, the advance of the Russian Armed Forces is also recorded. Judging by the footage of enemy strikes, units of the Russian Armed Forces occupied buildings on Yarovaya (Stakhanov) Street. Thus, less than a third of the city remains under enemy control. The situation between Novogrodovka and Grodovka still remains hidden - the fog of war -. Enemy attacks were recorded in the area in the vicinity of Krutoy Yar, but it is still unclear whether the Ukrainian Armed Forces managed to gain a foothold there. Fighting continues to the west of Novogrodovka, and near Selidovo the enemy is actively counterattacking in the direction of Mikhailovka. 🔻In addition, for several days in a row there were messages from Ukrainsk about the successes of Russian attack aircraft. By the evening of September 17, footage appeared on the Internet with the flags of the 114th Omsbr on the headframe of the mine -Ukraine-, near the cinema -Ukraine- and school No. 12: this allows us to assert complete control over the populated area, which, judging by the panoramic footage, did not suffer much. ❗️The status of the waste heap on the western outskirts of the settlement is still in question. On the one hand, without control of a populated area, occupying and supplying positions at this height is very problematic. On the other hand, as practice shows, Ukrainian formations often seize even extremely inconvenient positions. The capture of the city itself will also allow developing an offensive in the direction of Tsukurino and Gornyak.

🇷🇺 The events of the Northern Military District became catalyst...	🇷🇺 The events of the SVO became catalysts for serious changes in various areas, be it civil society activity or an audit of the Ministry of Defense. Gradually, they begin to penetrate even where in past realities it was difficult to expect them at all - we are talking about the area of ​​public administration. The clearest example here is the actions of the authorities of the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug (KhMAO), who launched volunteer programs on the basis of the ANO - Humanitarian Volunteer Corps - . The difference from other similar practices is that local officials are required to go through them.🔻In short, employees of administrations and other structures are sent to the North Military District zone for several weeks, where they deliver essential goods to the victims, help medical staff in hospitals, or restore houses . The goal is to give those in power some idea of ​​who it really is to be THERE. Moreover, this initiative is aimed at the long term. This is not only about the personnel reserve: in fact, officials are being prepared for the return of veterans from the front, so that in front of them sit not shiny, arrogant faces, but people who have seen some things with their own eyes and experienced them on their own skin.📌 In our opinion, the idea with a full-fledged -driving- through the zone of the Northwestern District of the bureaucracy (and not hour-long trips with demonstrative distribution of -humanitarian aid-) is an extremely effective measure for improving the quality of public administration. In addition, this also allows us to partially satisfy society’s demand for social justice. I would, of course, like to see how the initiatives of the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug authorities would be adopted by other similar structures officially aimed at forming a personnel reserve. Fortunately, the region provides all the developments on this topic for free - all you have to do is take advantage of it. #Russia #KhMAO@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63604	2024-09-17T11:27:37-07:00

According to him, they intend to deploy its core by 2027, and at the moment the first two launches of spacecraft have already taken place. Judging by the documents, the project is being carried out by the company Bureau-1440, which has previously carried out successful tests of data transmission using the 5G protocol and inter-satellite laser communication . In total, by 2030 it is planned to deploy 383 devices in orbit to provide space Internet services. The cost of the program will be about 445 billion rubles. Of these, almost 37.5 billion will be provided as concessional loans, and 329 billion are planned to be raised from extra-budgetary sources of financing, apparently through domestic telecommunications companies.📌 Despite the large amounts, the domestic analogue of Starlink is extremely important for providing the population with high-speed access to Internet and scientific and technological development, as well as the country's defense capability. In the future, all costs will pay off, and not only (and not even how much) from a financial point of view. It is curious that in Russia similar projects existed in the last decade, but they were in no hurry to allocate money for them. The catalyst was largely the SVO, when, against the backdrop of the use of Starlink for military purposes, the need for such a national system became obvious. #space #Russia@rybarSupport usIzvestiaOrbital authority: the project to create an analogue of Starlink in the Russian Federation will cost 445 billion It provides for the creation of a constellation of 383 satellites and will decide communication problem in remote areas of the Russian Federation	https://t.me/rybar/63603	2024-09-17T10:30:23-07:00

🔁🖼 Answer to the question: - since drones/artillerymen/signalme...	Forwarded From Turned in war 🇷🇺Answer to the question: -since drones/artillerymen/communicationists cannot be sent, then who will storm?- In the very formulation of such a question with an attack, it is not even the topic of a specific crime that comes up, but the problem in general. Assault infantry is initially an elite unit for solving the most difficult tasks that require trained specialists who have an established connection with other units - when artillery does not just hit somewhere, but at a specific point for attack aircraft to break through, when tanks do not just They set up a carousel and eliminate the enemy firing positions specifically indicated by the attack aircraft. Assault infantry is cultivated for a long time, paying in blood for experience and gaining cones, earning its authority and gaining the opportunity to make its own decisions during the assault. Now, the speakers justifying the situation literally praise the process of transforming elite units into an analogue of penal battalions: - Was he at fault or did he not complete the task, did he simply send an illiterate commander, or did he simply not like him for some reason? - Welcome to the assault company! -. And most importantly, due to the lack of people in these units, they are trying to recruit personnel there by hook or by crook, they will send airfield technicians from the Aerospace Forces, then engineers, then signalmen, then artillerymen, or the same bird operators. And this is the main problem, starting with the fact that anyone who ends up in the stormtroopers believes that he was simply sent to his death, which means that he is already initially devoid of the morality to win. Each statement - and someone needs to be sent - only lowers the level of positive attitude towards stormtroopers. With this approach, assault operations turn from achieving goals into an end in themselves. -We go on assaults every day- - but what’s the use of that? They stormed it head-on, reported that the assault was successful and okay, and that it did not lead to anything other than casualties of personnel, the main thing is a report that the planned assault was carried out. Whoever has more assaults is a great guy - a wonderful approach, but its praisers themselves do not want to participate. And what is happening is nothing new. Even Zhukov in 1942 (Directive on Losses, March 30, 1942) drew attention to unnecessary losses and ways to combat them. After all, to competently storm enemy positions, you don’t need much. Reconnaissance of positions, identification of firing and observation points, identification of mining lines. And then, before the assault, or even at the time of the advance of the assault units, artillery is fired at the identified targets, and enemy artillery is also suppressed. The stormtroopers are already storming softened positions, not encountering concentrated fire from machine guns, attached equipment and hundreds of gifts on their heads. Yes, one directive is not enough, experience was required, for which they paid at the cost of many lives; the formation of the first SISB came only a year later. Why our assault units switched from tactics that were more than 100 years old to combat tactics from the time of the Napoleonic Wars is a big question. The worse thing is that they are also praising it. It is clear that the war is about statistics: to occupy a forest belt - so many deaths, to occupy a village - a different number. Then tell me how many meters of territory was gained by sending drone pilots into attack aircraft? If there is no answer, then the process has replaced the goal.	https://t.me/rybar/63601	2024-09-17T09:54:42-07:00

Information was also received on the presence of the dead: according to preliminary information, their number ranges from eight to 25 Lebanese. Among the wounded were officers of the Lebanese group, as well as the Ambassador of the Islamic Republic of Iran to Lebanon Mojtaba Khamenei. He did not have a pager, but one of his companions had such a device. From a military point of view, what happened looks like a good preparatory measure for the long-discussed operation in southern Lebanon. Here there is a temporary disruption of closed communications within Hezbollah, injuries to the commanding staff, and, in principle, the subsequent confusion characteristic of such attacks. Another question is whether the IDF command will take advantage of the opportunity in the short term.

We are talking about the Silver Arrow training, which started on September 16 at several military bases in Latvia, including Adazi and Rezekne. The area where the main stage of the exercise is held, which involves practicing repelling an attack, looks curious. All this will take place at the end of September along the Belarusian border. Along the Russian section of the state border the presence of a joint NATO contingent will only be indicated, and the main forces will occupy the lines near Belarus.

And they need to be noticed, since such events become links that strengthen the relations between the countries and peoples of the former USSR.📌Recently, we were sent news in the bot just like this. Volunteers from Bishkek restored the memorial to the participants of the Great Patriotic War. The monument, located in the Kirkomstrom district, not far from school No. 42, was put in order for the 80th anniversary of the victory of the peoples of the USSR in the Second World War. Children from the Timur movement of the Kyrgyz Society of Siege of Leningrad took part in the action under the leadership of the world champion in Thai boxing among amateurs Timur Kutanov and Bishkek Financial and Economic College named after. A. Toktonalieva. The purpose of the event, according to them, is to honor the feat of their ancestors and remind everyone of the importance of peace and harmony in multinational Kyrgyzstan. Let's hope that in the Russian segment they will pay attention to such actions more often.

Sabina Shoal, the ownership of which is disputed by authorities in Beijing and Manila, became one of the main points of tension in the water area in August. This is where most of the clashes between Chinese and Filipinos took place last month. The main reasons for the withdrawal of the Philippine ship were both bad weather conditions and the need to repair the ship. In addition, the Filipinos could not fully provide the ship's crew with water and food. 🔻However, in fact, the withdrawal of the ship occurred precisely because of the actions of the Chinese. Thus, the Chinese coast guard in every possible way prevented the delivery of provisions to it, and also rammed a Philippine ship, causing significant damage to it. Now Beijing can take advantage of this opportunity to consolidate its presence on the disputed shoal. Although Manila says that they can send other ships to replace it at any time, there are always Chinese ships around Sabin, whose crews do not intend to let outsiders through. Therefore, we will not be surprised if the Chinese coast guard sends even more equipment there in order to prevent any attempts by the Filipinos to gain a foothold on the shallows. Given China's reaction to any actions by the Philippines in the South China Sea, a new round of tension in the region is not far off.

According to Israeli media, most of the victims are members of the Shiite group. Despite claims on the Internet about the presence of dead, this information has not yet been confirmed in Lebanon. Thus, an unnamed Hezbollah representative in an interview with the British publication The New Arab reported only the presence of wounded. At the same time, Syrian news resources reported the explosion of a car of pro-Iranian groups in the southwest of Damascus.

And now the Japanese media are publishing the first details of the joint statement that will be adopted following the meeting. First, the parties will discuss the deployment of a new communications infrastructure in the region, which should compete with other suppliers of such equipment. We are talking here, of course, about Chinese companies - they continue to dominate the Philippine market, which does not suit the US and Japanese authorities. Secondly, the leaders of the participating countries will probably advocate joint patrolling of the waters in the region. The first such event in the QUAD format could be organized as early as 2025 with the participation of the coast guard forces of the United States, Japan, Australia and India.🔻According to media reports, the main goal of such measures is supposedly the fight against illegal fishing. However, joint patrols of the water area will clearly be used as an additional tool to deter the PRC. At the same time, from an information point of view, QUAD representatives do not even need to invent anything. Indeed, in the same publications of Western media, it is the Chinese who almost always appear as poachers engaged in illegal fishing in the region. Thus, the authors of the initiative are killing two birds with one stone - under the pretext of fighting illegal fishing, the authorities of the United States, Japan, Australia and India will demonstrate the capabilities of coordinated actions to contain China. #Australia #India #USA #Japan@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usKyodo News+Quad plans joint patrols in Indo-Pacific to counter illegal fishingJapan, the United States, Australia and India plan to launch joint patrols to monitor vessels in the Indo-Pacific , diplomatic sources say, in the latest effort by the Quad group to counter illegal fishing in waters where China's influence is growing.	https://t.me/rybar/63588	2024-09-17T05:46:17-07:00

The vehicles are planned to be repaired and transferred to the Ukrainian Armed Forces in two batches - six at the end of 2024 and six more during 2025. According to media reports, the next initiative to provide military support to the Kyiv regime will cost the German Ministry of Defense 150 million euros. As noted by Bild, this is happening against the backdrop of a delay in the sale of German ammunition to Israel, which has not been approved for almost a year despite the IDF’s urgent need for shells . However, a similar deal with the authorities in Doha, who are important sponsors of Hamas, was agreed upon in the shortest possible time. What is also funny here is that Qatar certainly does not suffer from a budget deficit, but at the expense of others it is rearming its small army.

At the same time, Russian-speaking military personnel were transferred out of harm’s way from the base in Marculesti near Chisinau. An increase in the number of military personnel from Romania and other NATO countries is noted at the military airfield.🔻Information that cargo planes with weapons for the Ukrainian Armed Forces are already regularly received in Marculesti has appeared before. In addition, there are always Ukrainian mechanics and military personnel at the airfield who service Soviet-style helicopters. And the current modernization of the GDP and the deployment of maintenance stations can be associated with nothing more than preparations for receiving F-16 fighters. The Russian Foreign Ministry recently expressed concern about this. However, the Moldovan authorities predictably deny the facts. As we noted earlier, now Moldova and its Western curators are focused on the re-election of Maia Sandu in October. Just after the elections, we should expect more serious steps by the authorities in Chisinau to drag the country into direct conflict.

🔁🖼 About the importance of reading books for a young growing bo...	Forwarded From Revenge of Good Will About the importance of reading books by a young, growing organism (and not only). A week ago, after watching a video with apologetic youngsters as they were called (yeah, each forehead is 20 years old), what was most infuriating was the inability of the modern younger and older generation to connect even two words in your conversation. Although no, believe me, they can connect more than two words, but this speech will be absolutely uncultured, full of swear words and slang. The main reason, as we see it, is the extremely low vocabulary of our primordially rich and powerful Russian language, which could take from books that sow rational, good, eternal things. We conducted a survey that confirms our own data, which adds up to a terrifying picture - about 40 percent of modern teenagers do not read books at all, and 25-30 percent read 1-2 books a month, and even then, most likely, as part of the school curriculum in abbreviated summary. This is negligible. We read much more in our time. One of the admins could read 2-3 books a week, read avidly, in principle thanks to books, and survived a difficult puberty period, did not contact the street, living in a not particularly prosperous area. It’s just that at one fine moment the craving for the inner world of books became stronger than the craving of the street. Books were borrowed from the library once a week and were mainly on military topics. For example, K. Simonov's trilogy - The Living and the Dead - was read in the 8th grade, and then reread several times, including in adulthood. By the way, the path to the library was mostly on foot and was 3 km in one direction. Once a week. Autumn, winter, spring. For the summer, books were taken in packs, but, however, they were read in smaller volumes. After all, it’s summer, the village, there’s not much time for them here. The second admin had an extensive parental library at hand and read at least three books a month. Modern teenagers, and adults too, are actively instilled with clip-meme thinking: short videos, meme pictures. They are easy to digest, with this type of thinking it is easy to switch between different information, but then the essence is lost due to superficial immersion. Long texts, in modern jargon longreads, people stop reading, they don’t want to think and reason, it’s easier to read the opinion or post of an expert or a trusted blogger, but the worst thing is that there is also active propaganda about the uselessness of long texts. Like, people are not interested in them, write shorter, telegram post format - for a maximum of one phone screen. This is very dangerous, people, no matter what age, stop thinking and reasoning with their minds, they memorize short theses, and that’s enough for them. Reading large amounts of text is very important both for replenishing your vocabulary and developing the ability to clearly and competently express your thoughts in adolescence, and for the ability to think, reason and draw your own conclusions as adults. Find opportunities to read yourself and force your children to read. Whoever was not lazy and read to the end - put 🆒Revenge of good will	https://t.me/rybar/63584	2024-09-17T03:31:39-07:00

Several thousand of them have already been shipped since May, and the 20th anniversary launch recently took place. Everything happens according to the standard scheme - North Korea sends -gifts-, and in South Korea they wait for them to fall on their own, so that they can then remove the waste. They fundamentally refuse to shoot down such air targets for fear of causing damage to infrastructure. Pyongyang is well aware of this and does not plan to reduce the scale of such raids. According to the latest estimates, the material damage from them for the authorities in Seoul is $140 thousand. Moreover, during the last launches of the balloons, fires broke out at least twice at the places where they fell. 🔻And although the level of public dissatisfaction with the approach of the South Korean authorities is increasing, the government is not yet going to take serious measures to combat the problem. It also does not plan to reduce the scale of propaganda against the DPRK broadcast across the border, which is the formal reason for launching garbage balloons. The authorities in Seoul could follow in the footsteps of the previous administration, which limited the provocative actions of its own activists. However, such steps do not fit into the obvious anti-North Korean policy of the current president. #DPRK #SouthKorea@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usYonhap News AgencyN.

Forwarded From Sex, cartels, Frida Kahlo🇺🇸🇬🇪 Speaking of -unprecedented external interference-, which is announced as a background to the future Georgian elections. English-language media, talking about how former Prime Minister Ivanishvili invited Georgians to apologize to the Ossetians for starting the 2008 war years, they presented the story in a very non-trivial style for themselves. There are no accusations of some kind of pro-Russianism - and indeed no direct criticism at all. Details are noted: that Ivanishvili said this at a rally in Gori, briefly occupied by Russia in 2008, that the West, Russia and China have their own interests there. It is stated that most of those now living in South Ossetia are ethnically different from Georgians and -they say they were forcibly absorbed into Georgia under Soviet rule-. In conclusion, a report commissioned by the EU in 2009 is mentioned, from which the words -Georgia provoked the war by attacking Tskhinvali in South Ossetia with the use of heavy equipment- were extracted. At the same time, they still quoted the words of Saakashvili’s party, which considered Ivanishvili’s statement a national disgrace that serves the interests of Russia - and left the Georgian spelling of Tskhinvali. As a result, theses have already been thrown in that can be used for:▪️Media campaigns against -Russian influence- in Georgia.▪️Media campaigns against the current Georgian elite through dispelling the guilt of Georgians before other peoples.▪️Media campaigns against the current Georgian elite through supporting opposition and revanchist sentiments within Georgia itself .Of course, the matter is not exhausted by this topic, but let’s see what kind of rhetoric will be in fact. #Georgia #USA #mediatechnology@sex_drugs_kahlo - Latin American happiness [no]TelegramRybar🇬🇪🇷🇺🇺🇸 On the eve of the parliamentary elections in Georgia scheduled for October, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said that they would be held against the backdrop of unprecedented external interference.

Especially in the light of the finally arrived understanding of the economic feasibility of being friends with close Russia, and not with the distant EU and the USA. It seems like the other day Georgia spoke about its ability to apologize for the 2008 war and Saakashvili’s behavior. Terrorists traveling through Georgia to Ukraine are such a factor for a reliable partnership.

Reports of the enemy entering the first two settlements are not confirmed by objective control personnel, while north of Medvezhiy UAV operators defeated a group of armored vehicles of the Ukrainian Armed Forces heading towards Glushkovo. ▪️In the Korenevsky district, the Russian Armed Forces are advancing, liberating Russian villages. Today, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced control over Uspenovka, but it has not yet been possible to confirm this with video materials, as well as the liberation of Darino. The only thing known for certain is the ongoing attacks of the Russian Armed Forces in the direction of populated areas. In addition, fighting is taking place in Lyubimovka, located to the north, and to the east of it, an Ukrainian Armed Forces tank was destroyed in the Zeleny Shlyakh area. ▪️In the Sudzhansky district, Russian Aerospace Forces aviation is actively working on identified enemy concentration areas near Pravda and in the vicinity of Yuzhny. In addition, official reports have appeared about the liberation of the village of Borki, but according to information from places on the western outskirts, there may be a focal presence of members of Ukrainian formations. Against this background, there is also contradictory information about the exit of assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces to the outskirts of Plekhovo.▪️On the Spalnoye-Kucherov-Ozerki section, there has been a lull for quite a long time; none of the settlements appears in reports from both sides. Probably, the territory was cleared by Russian fighters after repelling the attacks on Giryi, or some time later.▪️In the area of ​​​​the New Way, unmanned aircraft attacked Ukrainian Armed Forces equipment, which could not be identified. Some sources call it an American-made M270 MLRS, but placing it near forward positions is practically pointless due to the high risk of destruction.

Russian troops continue to advance in several directions at once in the Vodyanoye area. To the north and northeast of the settlement, Russian assault groups, with the support of armored vehicles, are clearing forest belts between the Ikryannaya and Solenenkaya gully.🔻In the area of ​​the Yuzhnodonobasskaya No. 3 mine, most of the territory of which was occupied by Russian attack aircraft several days ago, fighting continues. The presence of the enemy is recorded on the western outskirts of the industrial zone. At the same time, the Ukrainian Armed Forces tried to attack several times from the direction of Epiphany, but unsuccessfully. 🔻Fighting continues in the area of ​​the Yuzhnodonbasskaya No. 1 mine, in the vicinity of which the control zone has also been somewhat expanded. On the eastern outskirts and northern part of the Ugledar dachas, the Russian Armed Forces are launching multiple air and artillery strikes, and battles are taking place.

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇬🇪🇩🇪 About the visit of the Chairman of the German Bundestag to Georgia, Rybar quotes the words of Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, who said that the parliamentary elections scheduled for October will be held against the backdrop of colossal Western interference. ▪️Western officials themselves indicate their aggressive intentions by threatening to punish Georgia for the law limiting foreign influence. For example, US Deputy Secretary of State Uzrya Zeya visited Tbilisi in July, where she met with representatives of Western-funded NGOs. The official actually gave them the go-ahead to prepare mass protests in the country. ▪️Right now, the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the German Bundestag, Michael Roth, is visiting Georgia, campaigning against the ruling Georgian Dream party. ▪️So, Roth states that elections should be -free and fair-. Usually this statement is not disputed. But then Roth calls the current government -anti-democratic-, which means that the elections, in which the victory of the -Georgian Dream- is possible, can be declared -undemocratic-. ▪️Moreover, Roth was already in Georgia in May and participated in protests against the law on foreign agents, which can be considered as direct foreign interference in the affairs of the state.▪️In addition, Roth criticized the recently adopted law against LGBT propaganda in Georgia. Previously, the politician attributed a destructive role to the Georgian Orthodox Church. ▪️Now Roth is again meeting with representatives of Western NGOs in Georgia, including the Georgian Young Lawyers Association, the International Society for Fair Elections and Democracy, Transparency International – Georgia, the Center for Social Justice and the Institute for Research on Democracy.▪️ The Georgian Dream party noted that they did not want to meet with Roth because of -offensive remarks about of the Georgian people and faith -.🔻Situations such as these show how the USA and the EU over many years have created an extensive network of their agents of influence and how they now unceremoniously come to them for consultations, as if on an equal footing with the government. It is obvious that Western countries and their agents do not intend to reduce the degree of their interference in the internal affairs of Georgia and will use the moment of parliamentary elections at any cost to return the country to the path of deprivation of its sovereignty. #Georgia #Germany @pezdicide no chemistry - just facts	https://t.me/rybar/63568	2024-09-16T10:00:10-07:00

Today, the Cobra Warrior event of the joint NATO air forces started over the territory of Great Britain, which will last until the beginning of October. The range of tasks during the exercise is truly extensive. There are strikes on mock enemy ships, missile launches against ground targets, repelling an air raid, and an attack as part of multinational groups. It involves both the most modern F-35 and F-16 fighters. In addition, army aviation helicopters, AWACS and refueling aircraft were involved in the exercise. The exercise itself is standard in nature, however, as has already been said more than once, their number has increased significantly compared to previous years, which is associated with growing hysteria around Russia. Thanks to the exaggerated danger, NATO is successfully increasing defense spending, producing more and more weapons and military equipment, while simultaneously developing resources beyond at the expense of their taxpayers. And exercises of this kind themselves allow you to keep your units in good shape, especially taking into account the experience of the Northern Military District, since the participation of European armies in real conflicts is limited to operations of a local nature, but not regional.

A surge in such episodes indicates the problems of the Ukrainian formations with air defense in the area. Apparently, the Ukrainian Armed Forces do not risk transferring medium- and long-range systems closer, especially against the backdrop of effective attacks by the Russian Armed Forces on HIMARS and other -fat- targets in the border area. At the same time, some of the transferred short-range enemy air defense systems were destroyed or even became trophies of the Russian troops. Which together obviously affects the air cover of the Ukrainian Armed Forces group in the occupied areas of the Kursk region. This is also another example of the fact that attack UAVs such as -Inokhodets-, -Forpost-R- or -Mohajer-6- have not lost their relevance - in the absence or Due to the insufficient density of enemy air defense, they quite effectively destroy enemy equipment.#Kursk #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63566	2024-09-16T07:22:19-07:00

Forwarded From Two MajorsMilitary preparations of ⚡️NATO countries for global conflicts of the futureThe German Institute of World Economics in Kiel (IfW) published a report -Readiness for war in decades: the slow rearmament of Europe and Germany in relation to Russia -, &nbsp; in which it states the unpreparedness of the military-industrial complex of 🇩🇪Germany, 🇫🇷 France, 🇬🇧Britain and 🇵🇱Poland for confrontation with 🇷🇺Russia.&nbsp; Despite the customized nature of the study, the data provided allowed us to draw useful conclusions: ▪️the desire to supply the Ukrainian Armed Forces with shells has not yet resulted in an explosive increase in production: the Bundeswehr was able to order the supply of only 372.7 thousand 155 mm shells in 2023-2024 together with 🇩🇰 Denmark , 🇪🇪Estonia and 🇳🇱Netherlands and within the framework of the European Initiative, as well as 148 thousand 120 mm tank ammunition. Delivery of these shells will take from two to five years;▪️production volumes affect the decline&nbsp; ammunition prices: 155 mm shells purchased by the Bundeswehr in 2024 cost 2.7 thousand euros, a year earlier - 4.08 thousand euros, in 2020 - about 6 thousand euros;▪️despite the increase in purchases of military equipment after the start SVO (from January 2020 to July 2024, Germany made 187 orders worth 137.6 billion euros, of which from March 2022 to July 2024 there were 122 orders worth 89.9 billion euros) current production and procurement volumes will allow for restoration parity with the Russian Federation only after decades, and in some categories up to a hundred;▪️there is a reorientation towards strengthening the ground forces: half of all&nbsp; German military procurement since 2022 has been aimed at supplying ground units of the Bundeswehr.&nbsp; The time of compact armies is a thing of the past; ▪️surprising was the lack of data on increasing costs for the purchase of unmanned systems.&nbsp; Instead, Germany ordered 35 fifth-generation F-35 aircraft in 2022.▪️ Until 2024, a significant part of German military purchases went only to replace the weapons supplied to Ukraine, but now the focus is on restoring its own capabilities.✨Such publications in the West are used to prepare public opinions on the rapid waste of governments on military purchases.

Thus, in the Yemeni province of Damar, the Houthi air defense neutralized the tenth Reaper since the beginning of the escalation in Palestine and Israel. Taking into account the cost of one individual strike and reconnaissance drone at $30 million, in total the Yemeni fighters in slippers have accumulated such UAVs in the amount of $310 million.🔻Given the number of American drones intercepted by the Houthis, who do not have high technological capabilities, it is quite the reputation of the most consistent defenders of the Palestinian people has been successfully established. In this matter, the Yemenis can be envied: it is enough to compare how comfortable American reconnaissance UAVs feel over the same Black Sea and how the issue of foreign presence in the airspace of the poor republic is resolved by the Ansaralli fighters.📌It is also worth It should be noted that in addition to the downed UAVs, the Yemenis have plenty of reasons to rejoice: just yesterday they struck the central part of Israel. The launched rocket flew approximately 2000 km and fell in an open area. The Israelis failed to intercept it. Most likely, as part of a symbolic response, the United States will bomb the territory of Yemen, but it is more likely to again be ineffective: during the years of the war, Ansarallah managed to build a network of underground bases, at the same time establishing false launch positions on the surface.

The Fano rebels, who rebelled against the oppression of the Amhara people, achieved great success over the last month.▪️So, during the fighting from August to September, they reached the border with Sudan through the city of Matema. Ethiopian troops, finding themselves pressed against the territory of another state, surrendered to the Amharians. After this, the rebels continued their movement, occupying the abandoned headquarters of the armed forces in Shinfa.▪️In the center of Amhara, the Amharas also made progress. Between Gondar and Bahir Dar they occupied six waders (zones), in which local representatives were elected by popular vote. -Fano - thus receives support from the people, showing that they are not thugs, as they are portrayed in the local media. There is also a response among the population who join the ranks of the rebels. So, from mid-summer, designations of Amharic army corps began to appear in reports, which means an increase in the number in the ranks of Fano.▪️At this time, the Ethiopian authorities are busy escalating relations with Somalia. After an international scandal related to the initiative to lease the port of Berbera in unrecognized Somaliland, the parties did not stop and are in the final stage before signing a memorandum.🔻As we wrote earlier, all this pressure on the Somali authorities and negotiations with Somaliland is just a way to find an external enemy for unity peoples of Ethiopia.

Despite the fact that the Americans accuse the al-Sisi regime of human rights violations, they have to admit that the Egyptian authorities are the guarantor of security in Africa and the Middle East. The merits of the leadership in Cairo as a mediator in negotiations between Israel and Hamas were mainly noted. At the same time, the Egyptian side does not need to strengthen the army in this direction. But Egyptian support for Somalia, which is being pressured by the Ethiopian authorities, is a more likely goal. The Americans have long wanted to curtail the African Union mission in the country, since they are the main sponsors, but they don’t see the point in it. And then, recently, the Egyptian authorities appeared, offering 10 thousand military personnel and supplies of weapons. Of course, the main funds will go to modernize the Egyptian armed forces, but some of them will still go to equip the military infrastructure in Somalia.🔻Probably, the American leadership is like this will try to appease Egypt and maintain its position in Somalia with a new mediator, but time will tell what will come of it.#Africa #Egypt #Somalia #USA #Ethiopia@rybarSupport usReutersUS grants Egypt $1.3 billion in military aid, overriding rights conditionsThe Biden administration is overriding human rights conditions on military aid to Egypt, a State Department spokesperson said on Wednesday, granting the U.S. ally its full allocation of $1.3 billion this year for the first time during this administration…	https://t.me/rybar/63562	2024-09-16T03:15:40-07:00

Among the documents signed: memorandums of understanding between Turkmengaz and the National Gas Company of Iran, as well as between the ports of Turkmenbashi and Amirabad. Iranian media call the documents -strategic-. Why became clear after Berdymukhamedov returned from Tehran. Chairman Khalk Maslahaty said that gas supplies to Iran will be increased to 40 billion cubic meters per year. Moreover, just this July, both countries agreed on supplies of up to 10 billion cubic meters of gas per year, and the entire gas production in Turkmenistan over the past year amounted to 76 billion cubic meters. In the near future, under the swap scheme, it is planned to export Turkmen natural gas to Iraq and further to Turkey. 🔻It is important for Ankara to resolve the issue of importing Turkmen gas, and there is mutual interest here. Currently, the buyers of Turkmen gas are China, Iran and Russia. However, the growth rate of China's economy is declining, and therefore Ashgabat hopes to redirect gas to European markets: attempts to approach these projects previously failed before they began. Ankara's plans include turning Turkey into a regional gas hub. In July, Turkish Energy Minister Alparslan Bayraktar already said that the agreement on swap supplies with Ashgabat was nearing completion. If Berdimuhamedov really agreed with Tehran, then Ankara's plans are close to implementation. #Turkmenistan #Iran #Turkey #Central Asia #economy@rybarSupport usIRNA RussianPresident: strategic agreements have been reached between Iran and TurkmenistanTehran, August 28, IRNA - The President said that between Iran and Turkmenistan Turkmenistan reached strategic agreements.	https://t.me/rybar/63560	2024-09-16T00:23:44-07:00

In the Donetsk direction, Russian attack aircraft have advanced north of Ukrainsk and are fighting in the city itself . Information about the release of Zhelanny First has not yet been confirmed. In the Yuzhnodonetsk direction, successes of the Russian Armed Forces at Vodyanoy are being recorded. The zone of control to the south and north of the settlement has been significantly expanded, and fighting is ongoing for the Yuzhnodonbasskaya-3 mine.

Units of the Russian Armed Forces managed to expand the zone of control both in the Grigorovka area in the north and to the west of Kleshcheevka.▪️Russian troops knocked out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from several positions north of Zheleznodorozhny (Zaliznyansky), reviving the frozen section of the front. Taking into account the geographical features of the area and information from our sources, we can say that at the moment the advance of Russian troops is significantly greater than what can be confirmed by the available personnel. ▪️Southwest of Grigorovka, Russian attack aircraft have made significant progress, taking control of a forested area and physically cutting off one of the roads leading to the village. The Russian Ministry of Defense also announced the liberation of the settlement, which, apparently, will be confirmed by the relevant personnel in the near future.▪️To the south, units of Russian troops crossed the Seversky Donets-Donbass canal and liberated a significant part of Kalinovo, gaining a foothold in apartment buildings. The village became the site of fierce battles because of its importance for the Armed Forces of Ukraine - the occupation of positions by the Russian Armed Forces in this area will allow them to launch an offensive to the south, bypassing the enemy’s defensive lines in the Oktyabrsky microdistrict in Chasovoy Yar. ❗️Russian attack aircraft are methodically clearing the positions of Ukrainian formations, using all available means to do this. During one of these operations, a fighter of the Russian Armed Forces destroyed personnel at a stronghold of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, equipped in a pipe under a railway bridge, by throwing a backpack with an anti-tank mine inside. Despite the certain danger of using anti-tank mines in this way, the tactic is becoming increasingly widespread among Russian assault groups. ▪️To the northwest of Kleshcheevka, the command of the Russian Armed Forces is conducting an offensive with the goal of knocking out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from the left bank and reaching a wide front towards the canal bed. During a series of battles in this area, Russian troops ousted Ukrainian formations from several forest belts. Now they are faced with the task of storming enemy positions in the forest to the west, control of which is necessary to cross the canal in several places. ▪️At the same time, the Russian Armed Forces regularly strike military infrastructure behind enemy lines. Yesterday, the Russian Aerospace Forces struck the territory of the carriage depot in Konstantinovka. According to some reports, the facility was used as a repair base and a storage place for Ukrainian Armed Forces equipment.

Meanwhile, in the southwest of the capital of the Palestinian enclave, there are skirmishes in the area of ​​the University College. In the south of the Gaza Strip, the Israelis again worked on Khan Yunis and nearby settlements, including coastal Al-Mawasi. And in Rafah, the creation of a buffer zone along the border with Egypt is coming to an end. In the West Bank, Israeli security forces carried out another series of operations, detaining several dozen local residents. The largest raids took place in Jenin and Tubas, where explosive devices from local militants were discovered. A steadily tense situation remains on the Lebanese-Israeli border: Hezbollah again reported attacks on IDF targets, and the Israelis worked on rear and border settlements, as a result of which there were casualties. Fighters of the Yemeni movement - Ansarallah - launched a rocket in the center Israel: the munition flew about two thousand kilometers and was shot down near Ben Gurion Airport. According to Houthi speaker Yahya Sari, the target of the attack was the port of Jaffa. 🔻A detailed analytical report on events in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_botHigh resolution mapEnglish version#digest #map #Israel #Palestine #report@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63546	2024-09-15T11:31:20-07:00
🇬🇪🇷🇺 As the date of parliamentary elections in Georgia approa...	🇬🇪🇷🇺 As the date of parliamentary elections in Georgia approaches, representatives of the ruling party are actively making loud statements. Take former Prime Minister Bidzin Ivanishvili: he recently spoke about the Nuremberg Trials for Saakashvili’s movement, and yesterday he announced the country’s readiness to apologize to the Ossetians for starting the 2008 war. The topic of the 08.08.08 conflict still remains a sore point for some Georgian society. Here the authorities are trying not only to satisfy the request for punishment of those responsible for the defeat, but also to present it under the sauce of condemnation of the fratricidal war with the inhabitants of the territories that Tbilisi officially continues to consider as their own. Such gestures also fit into the rhetoric of officials about plans for a peaceful return to the Abkhazia and South Ossetia. They are well aware of the degree of realism of such a scenario, but in current realities such statements look much more profitable than threats against Russia and promises to resolve the issue by military means. It is not worth seeing pro-Russian gestures in Ivanishvili’s statements: statements about possible apologies to the Ossetians - in First of all, pre-election domestic political history. This will not make revenge sentiments in Georgia much less, even if they are less pronounced.#Georgia #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramRIA NovostiGeorgia will find the strength to apologize to the Ossetians for the war that Saakashvili unleashed in 2008, said the founder of the ruling party - Georgian Dream - Ivanishvili	https://t.me/rybar/63545	2024-09-15T10:41:56-07:00

At the same time, the Russian Armed Forces managed to break through the defenses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the vicinity of Ukrainsk and occupy most of the city. ▪️In Grodovka, Ukrainian formations hold positions on the left bank of the Zhuravka River. The defense of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in this area relies on a network of fortifications to the north of the settlement, located above it relative to the terrain. This allows the enemy to conduct visual surveillance of the approaches to the village. ▪️South of Nikolaevka, the Armed Forces of Ukraine launched a counterattack towards Krutoy Yar in order to prevent the Russian Armed Forces from consolidating in the populated area. Russian units retreated to forest belts south of the settlement, where they regrouped. Considering that the enemy’s positions in Kruty Yar are practically semi-surrounded, we should expect renewed attacks by Russian troops in this area in the near future. ▪️The situation in the Novogrodovka area remains steadily tense. According to available data, Ukrainian formations are refraining from counterattacks and are preparing defenses at the Lysivka-Vyshneve line. In the area of ​​the waste heap of the Novogrodovskaya No. 2 mine, fighting continues; information about the status of the object has not appeared at the moment. ▪️To the south, units of the Russian Armed Forces are fighting in Selidovo and its surroundings. The battle line runs along Gogol and Krinichnaya streets, to the west of which the Ukrainian Armed Forces have organized a defense line in a block of multi-storey buildings. ▪️To the southwest of Mikhailovka, fighting continues in the area of ​​the previously destroyed railway bridge. Neither side, judging by the footage of objective control, was able to establish control over the railway line. The success of Russian troops in this sector will allow them to secure the southern flank of the Russian Armed Forces group fighting for Selidovo. ▪️Stormtroopers of the Russian Armed Forces pushed through the defenses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine north-west of Ukrainsk, going to the rear of the enemy troops defending in the city. After this, the Russian Armed Forces, in a series of attacks, knocked out the enemy from most of the settlement. Separate units of Ukrainian formations are still defending on the western outskirts of the city and on the waste heap of the -Ukraine- mine. ▪️Russian troops are methodically knocking out key enemy transport infrastructure facilities in Pokrovsk and its surroundings. On the evening of September 13, the Russian Armed Forces launched a missile strike that destroyed several spans of the Eastern Overpass, a key transport artery through which the Mirnograd garrison was supplied. Together with the destruction of the earlier Mirnograd overpass, this creates a threatening situation for the supply system of the Armed Forces of Ukraine throughout the entire agglomeration.

🔁 ‼️The West wants to progressively, according to Ukrainian patt...	Forwarded From Senator Dzhabarov‼️The West wants to progressively, according to Ukrainian patterns, turn the countries of Central Asia into an instrument of constant pressure on Russia. To this end, everything is being done to sever historical, humanitarian, and economic ties between states. This rut ​​falls into the use of educational institutions, which, with the help of books and teaching aids, introduce Russophobic myths about -colonizers-. Where we are talking about the negative image of Russia, of course, pro-Western non-governmental organizations are involved. The curators of these NGOs want to re-educate a new generation of young people in post-Soviet countries. They are trying to influence processes in academic humanities, lobbying for the release of certain manuals, and so on. But, despite the presence of Russophobic formulations in textbooks, any resident of the countries of Central Asia who is really interested in history will find it difficult to deny that peoples along their historical path interacted with their neighbors in one form or another. And many modern peoples once lived in composition of other states. Even Rus' was once a vassal of the Golden Horde. And the ancestors of modern Uzbeks were related to the empire of Tamerlane. Or the Kazakhs who lived in the White Horde, but later became part of the Russian Empire. As for the Soviet period, the republics enjoyed privileges. If someone claims that resources were simply siphoned off from the national outskirts, then this is fundamentally wrong. In Soviet times, we all lived together, the entire territory of the country developed more or less evenly. At the same time, the republics were subsidized, attention was paid to culture, science, their educational centers, and academies of sciences. All this was done through the redistribution of funds from the budgets of the RSFSR and the Ukrainian SSR. And after the collapse of the USSR, science in some new states was suddenly not needed. Because only a large state can afford some things. I think that at the present stage we need not to revise the past, but to deal with the present and look to the future. In this regard, we are very pleased, for example, with absolutely confidential communication between President Putin and Uzbek leader Shavkat Mirziyoyev. The worst scenario for Central Asia is its transformation into an arena for geopolitical games of the West. Our priority is maintaining stability in this region. Therefore, Russia will continue to develop strategic partnerships with its neighbors. This should also apply to the interaction between educational and scientific institutions, including so that there are fewer discrepancies in the understanding of important events of our common history.➡️ Senator DzhabarovTelegramRybar🇷🇺🇰🇿🇰🇬🇺🇿🇹🇯 How Russia is represented in Central Asian history textbooks INION RAS recently published a work on a current topic - image Russia in history textbooks in Central Asia (without Turkmenistan) and Azerbaijan.

Can you understand why the Kazakh Natsik was taught to hate Russians according to the Anglo-American program? He burned instantly. Think a little, don't look at the answer right away. Correct answer: Russian scientists, as native speakers of the Russian language, when using the word -Central Asia, had and still mean the subtlest connotation -Sredinnaya-, without averaging anything or anyone. In the same way, modern Ukrainian Nazis do not understand the proud word -Little Russia-, having deprived themselves of the richness of the Russian language, which is very precise in its meaning settings: for example, when Russians say -Small Circle- (communication, friends, management), it means the very, very central, especially trusted. Therefore, only Nazis trained in Central Asia can be offended by -Central Asia, and those who study according to the training manual -Little Russia / Little Britain- can be offended by -Little Russia. https://t.me/MedvedevVesti/18623TelegramAndrey MedvedevHmmm...Alma-Ata or Almaty?

🇺🇸🇻🇪🇪🇸 It is noteworthy that the disclosure of another CIA ...	🇺🇸🇻🇪🇪🇸 It is noteworthy that the disclosure of another CIA conspiracy occurred exactly during the period of worsening relations between Washington and Caracas. The appeal of the Venezuelan authorities to Spanish intelligence also appears here for a reason. This week, the Bolivarian Republic recalled the ambassador from Spain for consultations and summoned the Spanish ambassador to the Foreign Ministry for explanations: it turns out that the opposition candidate and main rival of Nicolas Maduro in the last presidential elections, Edmundo Gonzalez, arrived in Spain and has already met with the prime minister. Subsequently, the Spanish authorities accused the Maduro government is in a dictatorship. The arrest of citizens of unfriendly states (especially Americans) who are in the country under very murky circumstances is one of the methods available to the Venezuelan authorities not even to respond to the latest US sanctions, but rather to maintain the degree of the ongoing dialogue. Yes, it was dialogue - sanctions from the United States against the leadership of the Venezuelan Supreme Court, which confirmed the legitimacy of Nicolas Maduro, were a matter of time, and the impending seizure of the plane in the Dominican Republic was known almost in the spring. This was not something shocking for the Venezuelan leadership, but in the Western media it looked quite threatening. For its part, the Venezuelan Prosecutor General's Office issued an arrest warrant for Gonzalez - however, he was allowed to leave the country and fly to Spain, where he predictably engaged in propaganda against the team Maduro. So the current accusations of a conspiracy -to assassinate the top Venezuelan leadership - are quite consistent with the official -crisis- between the countries. And American citizens in a Caracas prison are an excellent opportunity for new contacts, allowing you to balance on the line between -a difficult situation- and -diplomatic success- for as long as necessary. 🇻🇪🇺🇸Venezuelan authorities have detained six foreigners on suspicion of plotting to assassinate President Nicolas Maduro and other Venezuelan politicians.

Forwarded From Sex, cartels, Frida Kahlo🇻🇪🇺🇸Venezuela authorities detained six foreigners on suspicion of plotting to assassinate President Nicolas Maduro and other Venezuelan politicians. Among those who are now exploring the world of Caracas prisons is, predictably, a US Marine. The Venezuelan Ministry of Internal Affairs has already reported that these comrades participated in a special operation that was allegedly organized by the CIA (well, who else?). Together with the thugs, 400 American rifles were confiscated - which were also supposed to be used in this case. Also from Venezuela they report, that among the conspirators are three Americans, two citizens of Spain (on the basis of this it has already been stated that Spanish intelligence is involved in what is happening) and one Czech. The State Department has so far confirmed the arrest of only one of its citizens, but is aware of unconfirmed reports of the detention of two more. All accusations by the Venezuelan authorities are rejected as -categorically false-. The Spanish embassy is still asking Caracas for official information on the case, and is also trying to provide access to its citizens. At the moment, it is known that the Spaniards were photographing something in Puerto Ayacucho, south of Caracas, and they even seemed to admit that they were looking for a group of mercenaries to deliver them to the Bolivarian Republic and entrust the liquidation of Maduro and the entire top leadership of the country .Basically, I expected something similar. A couple of days ago, the United States just introduced sanctions against those Venezuelan officials who still managed to get by without them. A little earlier, Maduro’s plane was seized in the Dominican Republic. The answer to all this has been asking for a long time, and this is not the first time that local authorities have arrested foreigners on charges of espionage - this especially often happens in the border areas. In the future, these people can become an excellent pretext for announcing the next negotiations between Caracas and the White House.#Venezuela #USA@sex_drugs_kahlo - Latin American happiness [no]CNNVenezuela afirma que un infante de Marina de EE.UU. está entre los extranjeros detenidos por una supuesta -operación- de la CIA…Venezuela dice que detuvo a seis extranjeros, incluido un infante de Marina de EE.UU., por un supuesto complot para -desestabilizar- el país.	https://t.me/rybar/63540	2024-09-15T07:19:34-07:00

It is noteworthy that the missile flew about two thousand kilometers, and it took Israeli air defense systems quite a long time to intercept it. At the same time, several anti-aircraft missiles hit civilian targets, including the Paatei Modiin railway station. Amid the attack, an air raid alert was declared in more than 20 locations in central Israel. Nine people were injured on the way to shelters. Fires also broke out in several places; four fire brigades were involved in extinguishing them. 🔻In turn, Houthi speaker Yahya Sari shared some details of the attack. According to him, a hypersonic ballistic missile was used for the strike, the target of which was a certain object in the Israeli port of Jaffa. The ammunition itself covered a distance of more than 2,000 km in 11.5 minutes. At the same time, the attack was associated with an Israeli air strike on the port of Al-Hodeidah that occurred in the second half of July, which killed six people and injured more than 80 others in various ways. degree of severity. 📌 Be that as it may, this is not the first time that the Houthis have demonstrated their ability to hit targets on Israeli territory: previously, the missiles they launched had already reached Eilat, and in July, a Yemeni UAV - Yafa - fell on the El Al building in Tel -Aviva, leading to the death of one Israeli and the injuries of ten more. What happened once again increased the authority of the Yemeni fighters in slippers as defenders of the Palestinian people, while in Israel itself the attack is already being actively used by the opposition to accuse the current ultra-Orthodox government of inability not only to solve the problem of shelling from the south of Lebanon, but also powerless against the threat of the Houthis. Well, the Israeli command will need to give an explanation of what happened. If previously, to combat such attacks, the Israelis had repeatedly scrambled fighter jets and shot down missiles from drones over the Red Sea south of Eilat, this time the same was not done.

The air defense forces of the Russian Armed Forces intercepted 29 targets in the country's airspace, most of them were shot down over the Bryansk region. The presence of Ukrainian Armed Forces drones was also recorded in the Oryol, Kursk, Belgorod, Kaluga and Rostov regions. Part of the UAV was intercepted by air defense units over the Roslavl and Smolensk districts of the Smolensk region. Based on available information, no one was injured. 🔻Today’s raid by the Armed Forces of Ukraine was probably intended to reveal the positional areas of the Russian air defense forces and develop a route for a new attack on Russia’s critical infrastructure. Such attacks can be counteracted by striking the enemy’s military infrastructure, which ensures mass production of UAVs.

Blinken announced this in May, at the same time allocating more than $100 million to Sandu’s office for the presidential campaign. ▪️The opposition in Moldova is already recording violations of the Central Election Commission, which turns a blind eye to Sandu’s use of administrative resources during his campaign. After all, it is the American USAID that manages the Central Election Commission of Moldova in manual mode.▪️Finally, in Moldova, in recent years, a lot of Russian-language websites and channels have been blocked, political parties have been banned, and the diplomatic corps of the Russian Federation has also been reduced, accusing embassy employees of espionage using antennas on the roof. 🔻It is obvious that Sandu’s office and his American curators, even after such purges of the political and media field, feel enormous uncertainty about the stability of the course being imposed on Moldova. Therefore, as the election date approaches, we should expect other attempts to curtail the civil rights of the population.#Moldova #Russia #USA @rybarSupport usUnited States Department of StateSecretary Antony J.

Such footage was widely circulated in Arabic-language media and was used as confirmation of the IDF's intentions to launch a ground operation against Hezbollah in the near future. At the same time, the Israeli media came out in support of these actions. Later, the IDF press service denied the distribution of the leaflets. As it turned out, the announcement of evacuation from the Al-Wazzani area was a private initiative of one of the Israeli brigades, which was not coordinated with representatives of the command. Nevertheless, the leaflets did lead to the expected result: some residents of the area left their homes and went north. However, this is not surprising, given the constant shelling of the Israelis and the increased risk of an IDF offensive - and the Lebanese are well aware of its consequences from the example of what is happening in the Gaza Strip. #Israel #Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63536	2024-09-15T03:26:31-07:00
🇦🇲🇺🇸 About the negotiations between Antony Blinken and Nikol ...	🇦🇲🇺🇸 About the negotiations between Antony Blinken and Nikol Pashinyan The head of the US State Department, Antony Blinken, had a telephone conversation with the Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan. ▪️Washington notes that the parties discussed issues of expanding relations between the United States and Armenia, including cooperation in the field of energy, trade, investment and education.▪️Note that the issue of energy has recently arisen on the US-Armenian agenda. The United States is adventurously imposing on Armenia the construction of a new nuclear power plant using American technologies to replace the Soviet Metsamor nuclear power plant. Nuclear energy, which powers almost the entire republic, is now serviced by the Russian Rosatom. ▪️Blinken’s statements about support for the democratic development of Armenia could not be avoided. Just during the days of Blinken’s negotiations with Pashinyan, the Americans increased USAID funding from $120 million to $250 million. The stated purpose of the funds is to contribute to the economic sustainability of Armenia.▪️Although lately everything has been very good with the Armenian economy, but thanks to trade within the EAEU. The Armenian economy is critically tied to Russia, but the Americans are already openly declaring that their main task is to break the connection between Yerevan and Moscow. 🔻So American money for Armenia is another bribe to Pashinyan’s team. Moreover, on the eve of the US presidential elections, it is important for Washington to once again indicate the seriousness of its intentions in the region. The Americans, in the struggle to oust Russia from the Transcaucasus, are systematically depriving Armenia of its sovereignty, penetrating all the most important state institutions, working on, among other things, the energy issue. #Armenia #Russia #USA @rybarSupport usARMENPRESS Armenian News AgencyAnthony Blinken reaffirmed the importance of a stable and dignified peace between Armenia and AzerbaijanThe US Department of State presented details of a telephone conversation between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan.How...	https://t.me/rybar/63535	2024-09-15T02:35:08-07:00
🇷🇺🇰🇿🇰🇬🇺🇿🇹🇯 How Russia is presented in Central Asian tex...	🇷🇺🇰🇿🇰🇬🇺🇿🇹🇯 How Russia is represented in Central Asian history textbooks INION RAS recently published a work on a pressing topic - the image of Russia in history textbooks in Central Asia (without Turkmenistan) and Azerbaijan. This included texts on the countries of the foreign East, in which we found a lot of interesting things.▪️Kazakh textbooks indicate that the territories of Central Asia ended up being part of the Russian Empire due to treaty relations. But so much the worse for Russia, since it deceived the Kazakhs: it did not help in the war with Dzungaria, and then began a colonial policy: the Kazakhs lost their statehood, which was a manifestation of a gross violation of the conditions for the Kazakhs to accept Russian citizenship. By the 20th century, Kazakhstan began to turn into a multinational province of Russia, and the people, most of whose lands were taken away, left ethnic territories in search of a better life, and the very existence of the Kazakh nation became an acute problem - hence the positive attitude towards the national liberation movement. Soviet Kazakhstan, which had no rights and remained one of the provinces, also distinguished itself by repressions against cultural figures and the formation of economic dependence on the metropolis. It is noteworthy to mention Solzhenitsyn’s article -How can we develop Russia?-, in which Moscow’s claims to northern Kazakhstan are seen - hence the attention in modules on modern history to the transfer of the capital to Akmola (Astana).▪️Kyrgyz textbooks turned out to be the most favorable to Russia. They reflect different reflections on the accession of the north and south to the Empire: if for the northerners Russia became a savior from the oppressors from the Kokand Khanate, then for the southerners closely associated with Kokand its arrival became a conquest. However, the salvation turns out to be imaginary: the naive Kyrgyz did not realize that the Russian Empire had the goal of colonizing the entire territory of Kyrgyzstan. The arrival of Soviet power, which ensured the development of the national economy, is seen as salvation from Urkun (the exodus of the Kyrgyz to China after the 1916 uprising). As the authors of the review summarize, in the history of Kyrgyzstan there is no place for Russia as an enemy and colonialist; it is portrayed as a friend and strategic partner.▪️ Uzbekistan looks at the consequences of joining Russia in the context of preserving its own civilizational heritage. Through this prism, the arrival of the Russian Empire looks like an attack on traditions, for the preservation of which thousands of faithful sons of the people of Uzbekistan sacrificed their lives... The authors position themselves as fighters against the myth of the civilizational mission of Russia and the USSR: any imperialist state tries to justify its wars of conquest various propaganda myths such as that it brings progress and civilization to the conquered peoples, liberates them from despotism, as well as voluntary accession to metropolises, etc. ▪️ Tajik textbooks are the most controversial. It is recognized that the imperial and Soviet periods were an important stage of modernization necessary for the creation of a modern Tajik nation-state. However, it was with the advent of Russia that the Tajik people became divided and cut off from their roots. The turning point for the Tajiks was the fall of the Bukhara Emirate, plundered by the Bolsheviks, after which the forced separation of the Tajiks from the Islamic world and its culture ended and their introduction through Russia to Western technological values ​​began... Tsarist Russia conquered the body, and the Marxism-Leninism of the Bolsheviks took possession of the minds of the Tajiks, but the heart remained unconquered...🔻 In general, textbooks explain the motives for the annexation of Central Asia by economic and colonial expansion, which caused enormous damage to the cultural heritage and former statehood. Therefore, even Soviet modernization does not justify the suffering endured. In rare cases, accusations are brought not against the Russian state, but against Russians as a whole. However, it is clear that the soil for further incitement of hatred towards Russia has been sufficiently fertilized. #Kazakhstan #Uzbekistan #Tajikistan #Kyrgyzstan #Central Asia @rybarSupport usTelegram OBPV INION RAS An abstract collection has been published - Russia in the history textbooks of the countries of the Middle and Post-Soviet East, China -.

🖼 🇳🇪 Situation in Niger: continuation of counter-terrorism ope...	🇳🇪 Situation in Niger: continuation of counter-terrorism operations Summary for August 21 - September 14, 2024 In recent months, the armed forces of Niger have been increasingly active and regularly conduct counter-terrorism operations. 🔻At the beginning of September, they reported the detention of more than 200 people associated with terrorist groups. In the Abala region on the border with Mali, IS cells were destroyed: the militants were too active in collecting tribute from the residents of the surrounding villages, which attracted attention. Vehicles carrying explosive components were detained at the border with Burkina Faso. Apparently, the militants were preparing a relatively large offensive, which is indirectly confirmed by the attacks in the west of the country. At this time, terrorists are blocking some routes from other Sahel countries. In parallel, the authorities in Niamey are pursuing an active foreign policy, which the Americans are actively using, trying to promote their influence through contacts with officials. Recently, a US congressional delegation met with members of Niger's military circles, ostensibly to discuss security and intelligence. At the regional level, relations have been warming with countries in the Economic Community of West African Development (ECOWAS). A meeting took place between the chiefs of staff of Niger and Nigeria, during which they discussed the joint fight against terrorism near Lake Chad. In addition to this, Azerbaijani companies are active: for example, representatives of Azer Gold discussed security issues and the purchase of mines in the country with the authorities. This is especially noteworthy given the fact that the Turkish PMC SADAT is already operating in Niger.❗️This situation once again raises the obvious question of when to expect similar Russian economic activity in Niger. Because the longer we are stuck in bureaucracy and slowness, the more space is taken up by third players, and the more the window of opportunity for such activities shrinks.

🔁 In light of the instructions of the Minister of Defense publis...	Forwarded From Philologist in AmbushIn light of the order of the Minister of Defense (I quote) published by the press service of the Ministry of Defense (I quote) to quickly understand the situation related to the information about the death of two servicemen with the call signs Ernest and Goodwin of the 87th Separate Infantry Regiment, I would like to note the following moments. As we all understand, the case was able to give such a loud resonance due to the fact that Ernest and Goodwin were fairly well-known specialists in professional circles, many knew them personally (I met Goodwin and Hedgehog in June of this year.) Meanwhile The assault group sent to Lesovka in the early morning of September 11 included five specialists from that same long-range air reconnaissance team: Ernest, Goodwin, Socrates, Shock and Reef. In addition, the regiment commander also tried to send Zhenya Yozhik on this one-way assault run (now, thank God, she is already in relative safety). Moreover, the assault group itself consisted of at least 12 people (this figure is known to me as of the day of receipt combat mission group). The North Wind channel, which was led by Goodwin, now indicates that 14 people died on the mission. That is, in addition to the purposeful sending of Ernest’s crew for slaughter, we have another example of an unsecured meat assault, and in this case due to a false report about the capture of Lesovka. Further, based on the available data, including a certificate prepared by Ernest himself, and messages from other military personnel (see, for example, here and here), regiment commander Puzik (Evil) was generally noted for criminal abuse of official position and poor organization of combat work. To understand the state of the regiment (I quote): -This dispatch [of Ernest’s crew for the assault] is a personal score. But the boys are dying. The losses are huge. He wiped out the regiment. There is no one. The battalion commander was wounded in Lesovka, there were five hundred deputy battalion commanders. Disabled people are persecuted and everything else. No regiment. It is not capable of carrying out this task. However, the matter is not limited to this particular regiment. According to the 1st Slavic Motorized Rifle Brigade, under the operational subordination of the 87th OSP, there are similar signals of a blatantly irresponsible attitude towards specialists, including the disbandment of a group of UAV operators 268 1st rifle battalion and transfer of engineers from the 1st reserve battalion of the brigade to the infantry. Plus, combat work in the brigade during the Northern Military District was, in principle, organized in such a way that the once famous 1st Slavic Motorized Rifle Brigade was completely turned (literally) into a meat factory. Moreover, at the level of the entire 51st Donetsk Combined Arms Army (the former 1st Donetsk Army Corps), which includes the 1st Slavic Motorized Rifle Brigade, generally has a very eloquent message: -We don’t need smart people, we ourselves are smart.- We need assaults, meat - (quotes from great commanders). In general, the frankly criminal practice of sending valuable specialists to the assault infantry (both due to a lack of personnel and due to personal hostility on the part of the commanders) is, in principle, systemic in nature in the army. Unsupported meat assaults carried out in emergency mode, including as a result of false reports about the capture of certain positions and settlements, are also a systemic problem, as well as the sending of untreated wounded, sick, disabled and simply untrained fighters to such assaults due to a lack of personal composition. This case, as I said above, highlighted almost the entire range of problems within and around our active army. With the proper approach to the investigation (taking into account the reaction of the Minister of Defense), it could become a precedent for the systematic clearing of all these Augean stables.	https://t.me/rybar/63532	2024-09-14T23:10:06-07:00

Forwarded From the Fifth Republic French novelist Michel Houellebecq revealed the base in an interview with the Financial Times on the occasion of the translation of his latest book into English and, at the same time, walked through the so-called Ukraine. 📌Houellebecq became famous for his novels in which he describes the ordinary lives of ordinary French people, the loss of meaning in life for many of them and the loss of connections in a society divided by individualism and déclassé in France. He is one of the most significant modern French writers - although he is not part of the left-liberal elite , and does not support Macron or the left. His books sell well both in France and abroad; The 2015 novel Soumission is well known about the bloodless transformation of France into an Islamic state after the victory of moderate Muslims in the elections. 🔸 -War in Ukraine? And I don’t care, when it started, I was very surprised, because I thought that Ukraine was already Russia? -🔸 -People with humanitarian ideas are a disaster, and usually their motivations are ambiguous - (obviously about Kushner from Doctors Without Borders and the Little Pig Bernard Henri Levy )🔸 -In France, the elites consider the population to be cattle - and it is this contempt of the elites with the increase in the number of migrants that has been pushing the French towards the far right for 20 years, the writer believes.🔸 - it is more difficult to deal with these new elites than then [in 1789 during the French Revolution ] with the nobility, since the nobles were elites by birth, and these consider themselves to be so by culture and intellect -.🔸 In his opinion, there will be no civil war between Muslims and the rest of the population (where different lobbies are actively pushing France). -There will be a lot of violence, but not between Muslims and the rest of the population, but between the migrants themselves. Previously, they mainly came from North Africa. Now they come from Somalia and Pakistan and import their conflicts, solving them with the help of Kalashnikov assault rifles -. 🔸 He was also asked whether the French feel a sense of duty to their former colonies? -Nobody is interested in this, we have no feeling of guilt, except for Algeria, whose people never forgave De Gaulle for his betrayal (it gave impetus to various conservative parties - including the current national assembly). 🔸 Houellebecq incidentally spoke out for Trump - since he did not start new wars - while he was president and considers it good news if he stops supporting Ukraine. -It is necessary for nature to take its toll. 🔻Houellebecq often says directly what is on the minds of ordinary French people - no one is interested in Ukraine, and even more so, starting some kind of third world war and dying for American interests. The French are concerned about much more pressing issues. #writer #interview #migrants #Africa #Ukraine @fifthrepublic : freedom, equality, drunkenness	https://t.me/rybar/63527	2024-09-14T22:27:10-07:00
🔁 #Review #Summary for September 15, 2024 ▪️ A little more than ...	Forwarded From Two majors#Review #Summary for September 15, 2024▪️ A little more than a month after the start of the invasion of regular Ukrainian troops into the territory of the Kursk region, the Russian Army was able to raise sufficient reserves to begin counter-offensive actions in the western sector of the enemy’s penetration, decisively reducing the zone of control enemy, the counteroffensive zone was up to 20 km, the depth of advance of the Russian Armed Forces was up to 13 km. However, the enemy, despite the losses suffered, does not stop bringing reserves into the region in the Sudzhan direction and abandons attempts to advance further to the north. A new element of the situation was the fighting that had been going on for several days in the south of the Glushkovo direction, where the enemy, burning equipment and personnel in the battles, advanced to the village. Vesele and expanded the zone of control near the village. Bearish. The depth of enemy penetration across the border ranged from 3 to 5 km, and heavy fighting is taking place. The enemy’s plan is to advance to the Glushkovo railway station and the populated area itself and begin to put pressure on the rear of our attacking troops in the Sudzhansky region. The situation is difficult, but the enemy’s channels are being inflated in vain - I will overcome - regarding a new penetration - our troops were ready for this development of events, although not to the extent that the front-line soldiers on the ground themselves would have wanted. In addition, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are operating in small groups in the western part of the Kursk region, ours are striking at enemy infantry that has infiltrated into Tyotkino. For now, it is not advisable for the civilian population to return to the evacuated areas, although there are isolated reports of such isolated facts of arrival at their places of residence.▪️ The scandal surrounding the tragedy in the 1st Slavic Brigade became extremely noisy, when two experienced UAV operators were sent to their deaths in a senseless assault. The Russian Defense Minister intervened in the situation, instructing high-ranking officials to investigate and report. In fact, this is the first high-profile case of Belousov’s direct participation in establishing order in the military administration; before that, the media more clearly showed his hand in bringing the administrative and economic part of the defense department to normal combat, as evidenced by the numerous arrests of senior officers of the Defense Ministry. The reason for bringing the situation to light in some parts was, apparently, beautiful reports, the failure of high-level inspections from the capital to fulfill their duties and the endless hushing up of problems. Unfortunately, it was the hype on telegrams after the death of the soldiers that became one of the main reasons for the reaction at the very top.▪️ In the Pokrovsky direction, the Russian Armed Forces are destroying overpasses near Pokrovsk itself, making it difficult for the enemy to logistics. The onslaught of our troops to the west has slowed down somewhat; we need to tighten up our convoys, and the enemy has brought its reserves into battle, trying to stabilize the front. At the same time, the Russian Army is closing its pincers around a large pocket to the south - from the liberated Krasnogorovka to the suburbs of Gornyak: yesterday they reported the capture of the Zhelanny First. The neck of the bag has been reduced to 5 km, the remaining (and in fact abandoned) units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are trying to get out of the almost complete encirclement. ▪️ Somewhat slower, but nevertheless, our offensive at Ugledar is developing progressively. The mines in the area of ​​the city are taken, the beginning of the movement from the taken Vodyanoye to the north of the city is visible, which indicates the plan to encircle the ill-fated city. ▪️ Separately, it should be noted the ongoing massive raids of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on our regions by aircraft-type UAVs. The enemy launched a huge number of them again only on Tuesday; the Ministry of Defense reported that 144 Ukrainian drones of this type were shot down. Unfortunately, reports in the media continue about -debris falling on explosive objects-, which indicates an unchanging approach to lull either the population, which already sees the consequences of the strikes, or the higher political leadership, which entails the failure to take appropriate long-overdue measures .Continued belowTelegramTwo majorsstarted above ▪️ In the Black Sea, a daring attempt by the enemy on more than 10 foreign boats did not lead to their capture of our jack-up drilling rig -Crimea-2-, but they reported the loss of a Russian combat aircraft involved in repelling the attack.

Unfortunately, in the current formation (first of all, this concerns the thinking of officers and those responsible for making decisions regarding this matter) there are two extremes: either everything is according to very inflexible instructions and rules (hello, the selection of civilian transport from the military and the senseless regulations of the commandant’s office ), or - Makhnovshchina and the laws of the jungle. It takes a lot of time and effort to fix this all together. We need to improve the entire military system. Today's instructions from the leadership of the military department suggest that a beginning has indeed been made for this. Unfortunately, the solution to these problems is often associated with high-profile (and usually tragic) incidents. In 99% of other cases, they always ask to show understanding, resolve the issue quietly, not wash dirty linen in public, and not give food to the enemy. Many similar excuses can be found. But this approach never leads to a solution to the problem as such. ❗️And let’s be honest: there is a very convenient article for discrediting the RF Armed Forces, which they take and turn in the right direction.

In the Kursk direction, Russian troops during the counteroffensive reached the outskirts of Lyubimovka and Pokrovsky. At the same time, the enemy is attacking the flank of the Russian Armed Forces in order to slow down the pace of advance.🔻In the south of the Glushkovsky district, fighting has been going on for more than a day on the southern outskirts of Vesely, where Ukrainian formations reached after overcoming the barriers on the border a few days earlier. The previously occupied New Path is being used by the enemy as a transit point, where assault groups of the Ukrainian Armed Forces dismount for further entry into the battle near Vesely. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, advanced assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces reached the outskirts of Pokrovsky and Lyubimovka, in the western part of which clashes are taking place. The enemy is moving reinforcements to slow down the advance of Russian troops. Support for the advancing units of the RF Armed Forces is provided by artillery and aviation, which regularly knock out fire support means of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Thus, in the Daryino region, Aerospace Forces aviation destroyed an enemy self-propelled gun at a firing position in a forest. ❗️The liberation of Lyubimovka will create a threat to the communications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine passing through highway 38K-030. In this case, the enemy group in the Korenevo area may face a severe supply shortage. The spreading information about the liberation of Daryino has not yet been confirmed, although at the current rate of advance we can soon expect the Russian Armed Forces to reach the northern outskirts of the village. The difficulty is posed by the Snagost River, which acts as a natural border.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, the Russian Armed Forces carried out an attack on Borki: after air strikes, assault groups entered the village and began destroying the firing points of the Ukrainian formations. At the moment, the enemy has been knocked out of positions at least in the north -eastern part of the village. This vector of advance of the Russian troops suggests that the neighboring Spalnoye is already under the control of the Russian Armed Forces.

🇷🇺🇺🇦 On the use of anti-radar missiles in the Northern Milita...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 About the use of anti-radar missiles in the NWO zone Recently, in feedback, we were asked a question about the use of anti-radar missiles (ARM) in the NWO zone, which arose due to a decrease in the frequency of their mention in news reports. Because of this, one could get the impression that they had stopped using them completely. In reality, there is no talk of abandoning the PRR - on the Internet you can still periodically find reports of Kh-31P launches against Ukrainian air defense systems or the interception of American AGM-88 HARM by air defense systems . Although there are nuances here: ▪️If you don’t go into some technical aspects, then neither the X-28/31P nor other types of PRR are prodigies that easily capture the necessary radiation and unmistakably follow the object. In this case, the principle of one launch - one hit is far from the principle.▪️The enemy also takes measures to maintain secrecy - he reduces the operating time of the radar stations of his air defense systems and changes positions. As a result, even for aircraft on duty in the air with PRR, it is not so easy to destroy enemy radars by launching the X-31P.▪️On the other side of the front, the situation is even worse - the installation of American AGM-88s on -non-standard- carriers in the form of Ukrainian MiG-29s led to restrictions on their application. This is also why they often fly around Donetsk or even cities occupied by the Kyiv regime. From the point of view of the effectiveness of using PRR, the picture is also different: if the RF Armed Forces have a certain number of damaged X-28/31P radars, then the Armed Forces of Ukraine have such episodes less than the fingers on your hand. At the same time, the enemy has not yet launched HARM en masse from the more standard F-16s. The development of anti-radar missiles in the future may follow the path of complicating homing heads and computing devices to expand their technical capabilities. As well as integration with target designation systems up to space ones.#Russia #weapons #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63521	2024-09-14T09:31:13-07:00

The trilateral training, which included the United States, Italy and Australia, took place over four days. Washington sent the destroyer USS Russel, Milan sent the aircraft carrier ITS Cavour, the patrol ship ITS Raimondo Montecuccoli and the frigate ITS Alpino, and Canberra sent the P-8A Poseidon patrol aircraft. 🔻The maneuvers focused on combined anti-submarine defense and development of interaction skills in the field of command and control. The main goals of the exercises were to strengthen cooperation between the three countries, reaffirm the US commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific region, and demonstrate its intentions to its allies. Considering that almost every time China sends ships and aircraft there in response to major exercises in the South China Sea, these exercises may not be an exception. Therefore, we should soon expect one reaction or another from the Chinese military.

Combined air-ground operations were suspended, which was taken advantage of by anti-government groups who carried out several attacks throughout the country. However, the largest attack was directed against civilians. Near the city of Barsalo, the armed forces attracted local residents to build a security perimeter - such a fortification system had already been built in the north and west, all that remained was to complete the eastern borders. Several militiamen from the -Volunteers for the Salvation of the Motherland- were assigned to guard the 300 workers. While working, they were attacked by about a hundred militants of the al-Qaeda-affiliated group Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimeen (JNIM), who killed more than two hundred peasants. This incident raised serious concerns about security in the area. Unfortunately, the situation in the country is really deteriorating, even if it is not as terrible as the Western media portray, which are already speculating almost on the topic of the possible fall of the capital Ouagadougou. A notable event on the foreign policy circuit was the non-participation of the country's President Ibrahim Traore in the Chinese-African forum - a similar decision was previously made by his Malian counterpart Assimi Goita. Instead, negotiations were held with neighbors from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The parties announced joint efforts to combat terrorism, which is especially important against the backdrop of JNIM attacks in previously uncharacteristic areas in northern Benin and Togo. In general, recent events in Burkina Faso are not in favor of government troops. At the same time, in the medium term the situation may change - the Afrika Korps is in the process of deployment and is only preparing new forces, and the government is relatively successful in recruiting volunteers.

The topic has long been discussed in British media, and it was especially actively discussed in light of the visit to Kyiv of the heads of the British Foreign Ministry and the American State Department. However, as a result of the meeting, politicians did not make any competitive statements on this matter. Therefore, it is worth dwelling on several aspects.▪️Firstly, the absence of an official announcement about the lifting of the ban does not mean that London and Washington did not give it the green light. It cannot be ruled out that the decision will be announced along with the first strike for greater media effect.▪️ At the same time, it cannot be ruled out that the collective West is currently satisfied with the current state of affairs at the front. As we mentioned earlier, the Anglo-Saxons are following the path of gradually increasing the level of escalation, largely for reasons of political necessity. With the deterioration of the position of the Kyiv regime, the situation can change very quickly - it won’t take much time to give a command. Moreover, the USA and Britain themselves do not risk anything, almost officially using the so-called. Ukraine to do the dirty work in its own interests. Of course, I would like to believe that the Russian leadership found some arguments that forced NATO to postpone the corresponding decision or even change its mind about making it.

At the same time, in the areas bordering Algeria there has been an increase in military presence, which Western analysts associate with the preparation of a revenge plan for the ambush near the town of Tin-Zautin. ▪️Air operations continue: a so-called separatist pickup truck was destroyed in the north. Azawad. In addition, troops combed the urban area, identifying weapons from residents of the city of Kidal, a former stronghold of the separatists. In addition, further south - the death road - from Douenza to Gossi, where there were recent ambushes on government forces, vehicles of radical Islamists affiliated with Al -Qaeda faction JNIM. Also in the Mopti region, the armed forces carried out an operation to free livestock stolen by militants in Bankass district. And to strengthen security in these areas, new prefects with experience as officers were appointed.▪️Meanwhile, the militants, despite the weather conditions, did not stop their attacks. The so-called separatists distinguished themselves in this. Azawad, who attacked the base in Gundam, Timbuktu region, using a quadcopter with a drop. Material damage from the attack was minimal, and the attackers called it a warning. In turn, militants associated with al-Qaeda attacked Malian army convoys west of the city of Gao, and also near the border with Mauritania - near the city of Nampala.🔻On In the political field, an important event was the trip of the transitional President of Mali, Assimi Goita, to Beijing for the forum on Chinese-African cooperation. In addition to meetings with African leaders, he concluded agreements on the supply of new equipment from the Norinco company. Interesting projects are also planned in relations with Russia - an intergovernmental commission is scheduled to start work in early October, the task of which will be to overcome bureaucratic barriers and support business projects between countries.

🔁 Yesterday, some commentators wrote with obvious surprise about...	Forwarded From Andrei Medvedev Yesterday, some commentators wrote with obvious surprise about another scandal involving British spies who, as it were, were still diplomats. -How can that be, but this is a violation of all principles of international relations-. However, in the case of the British, the case may be considered more surprising if suddenly, for some reason, the diplomat is not also an employee of the intelligence services. This has always been the case in Britain. There is often no difference between a spy and a diplomat/traveler/culturologist/journalist. One of the most famous orientalists in Britain is Arminius Vambery. He worked in the 19th century, lived in Istanbul, taught history and English to the children of the local elite, and traveled to Central Asia. in 2005, London admitted that Vambery was a spy (by the way, he was also the prototype of Van Helsing). Daniel Defoe, Alan Milne (yup, Winnie the Pooh), Somerset Maugham, Graham Greene, John Le Carré, and probably Kipling worked for intelligence. For the English, his main work is not -The Jungle Book,- but -Kim- and war poems. And judging by the content of Kim, the author was very well acquainted with the activities of the pandits and the working methods of the Indian Service and the Scout Corps. The two intelligence officers who were the first Europeans to cross Afghanistan from east to west - Charles Christie and Henry Pottinger - disguised as Tatar merchants are an example of how British diplomacy worked even then. Christie became a PMC instructor and military adviser and trained the Ukrainian Persian army in the war against Russia; he was killed as a Marine of the 810th brigade by a Russian Cossack in 2024 in the battle of Malaya Lokni in 1812, in the battle of Aslanduz. And Pottinger just became a diplomat, knight and governor of Hong Kong. All British diplomacy of the 18th and 19th centuries consisted entirely of diplomats with officer ranks, officers in the role of ambassadors (Arthur Connolly, the author of the term -Great Game-, is the clearest example of this), and all together intelligence officers. And then the tradition flowed into the 20th and 21st centuries. This is normal for an island empire, where expansion and diplomatic intrigue were the key to the survival of the state. The skill to play one against another and remain on good terms with everyone. And after all, the East India Company was the driver of diplomacy, intelligence and economic development for almost two centuries. The corporate state long predates the age of globalization. Without the Company, Britain would never have become an empire. And precisely in the Company the concept of -ambassador- was very vague. The British ambassador is not about maintaining etiquette or international relations. Only and exclusively about obtaining benefits for the Company and the Empire, and by any means. Anything at all. Here's an example for you. China and the Opium Wars. It's a long story to tell. But just read what role the British diplomats played, what their task was (spoiler: to keep all the Chinese on opium), where the Company was and what does HSBC bank have to do with it, which is still, by the way, the main bank from Gibraltar to Tokyo. It is worth remembering the role the British Embassy played in the February Revolution of 1917. Or remember where Herzen cleaned himself off, and then the Bolsheviks drank beer and held congresses. And just think, what a sensation. The British spoiled the Russians. What a miracle. PS The funniest story about English writers and intelligence agencies goes like this. George Orwell, who -1984- wrote, worked closely with the Information Research Department (IRD). This is a Foreign Office structure that fought against the influence of communist propaganda. So the author of a novel about the horrors of totalitarianism snitched there on actors, writers, scientists and politicians whom he suspected of sympathizing with the USSR. Orwell also kept a personal list of unreliable people. There is an opinion that he was actually an MI5 agent. Such are the things. And when adult children of our forty-year-old liberals start commemorating -1984- it always looks very funny. https://t.me/rybar/63471TelegramRybar🇬🇧🖇 About British spies in Russia and the intelligence activities of the British Foreign Office Today’s announcement by the Russian FSB to stop accreditation of six diplomats from the British Embassy in Moscow is another illustration of the rule, which almost never happens...	https://t.me/rybar/63516	2024-09-14T04:39:02-07:00

However, not from Russia, but from other forces, as the collective West is diplomatically called. The reasons for the pressure are not only in the sensational law on foreign agents, which has made it difficult for globalist structures to work. In Tbilisi, they directly call the pro-Western opposition agents and authors of the bloody regime, and also rightfully accuse it of seeking to open a second front against Russia. And the current Georgian authorities are serious about this issue. Recently, ex-Prime Minister Badri Ivanishvili announced that if they win, they plan to organize the Nuremberg Trials for Mikheil Saakashvili’s United National Movement party, recognizing it as unconstitutional.📌 Such initiatives are caused by the desire to maintain a stable situation, when a balanced policy has led to economic the rise of Georgia. Therefore, the ruling party intends to reduce the possibilities of foreign puppets who openly seek to drag the country into the Ukrainian conflict. And although Tbilisi does not plan to change its pro-Western course, the US and EU see these measures as threats to their interests and damage to their networks of influence. Therefore, they will consistently (but moderately) shake up the situation before the elections in order to weaken the position of the ruling party.#Georgia #Russia #USA@rybarSupport usVIEW.RUGeorgia did not see the threat of interference in the elections from Russia, unlike the WestRussia does not have the resource of serious influence on the elections in Parliament of Georgia on October 26, which will be held against the backdrop of unprecedented outside interference, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said at a press conference on Friday, the newspaper correspondent reports...	https://t.me/rybar/63514	2024-09-14T03:21:34-07:00

Someone brilliant came up with assault electronic warfare. To storm landings with trench electronic warfare, on which you need to press a couple of buttons to turn it on, they sent specialists from the -large-electronic warfare, trained at the stations and prepared for several months in training. Electronic warfare operators from units that do not directly participate in the air defense (VKS or Strategic Missile Forces, for example) are transferred to motorized rifles, because personnel officers need to close their staff.

An excellent specialist from Moscow proposed to the commander his ideas for forming a stable closed connection on a front line of a couple of tens of kilometers (the unit's area of ​​responsibility). But the commander needed a grenade launcher in the assault group. And the choice fell on the IT specialist. However, there was little choice. Artillerymen died in the assaults... Remember '22? For three months, new artillery divisions were trained at the training grounds. Specialists worked and spent time, money, and equipment on training. The output is ready-made calculations. Which upon arrival in the NWO zone turned out to be unnecessary. Because stormtroopers were needed. Only artillerymen were not trained in this. Engineers died in the assaults... A bespectacled graduate of Baumanka, who dreamed of his own workshop for the production of ground-based drones. He even assembled prototypes from a known substance and sticks. And I did not find understanding from the authorities. The authorities needed stormtroopers. I know different stories. And as the commander said: -I’m going, who’s with me?- And the volunteer stormtroopers broke ranks. And how the soldiers agreed to the position of cook and driver, just to get into the assault squad, in which there were no free places on staff. They went for the assault consciously. In 1922, everyone was sent to the assault out of despair, patching up holes in the front line. But at what point did the most difficult and dangerous work suddenly turn into punishment? I don’t know how fair the accusations against the command of the 87th Regiment are - the relevant services are now looking into this. But the very fact of repurposing an effective UAV reconnaissance crew into assault infantry in the current conditions is, to put it mildly, sabotage. -It is impossible to disband something that did not exist,- the regiment commander’s defenders write today. - They were snipers by state. If so, then I have bad news for you. This only means that in some formations they live in the last century and are very far from modern combat realities, if the regiment’s staff does not at least provide for a UAV department. And aerial reconnaissance is carried out by snipers, who have probably never even held a Dragunov rifle in their hands. But they were unmanned, without which it is simply impossible to fight today. @sashakots	https://t.me/rybar/63512	2024-09-14T02:37:54-07:00

First, after several months of empty talk, the European Union announced that they had begun negotiations on weakening the visa regime for Armenians (about the nuances we have already talked about this -bonus). And a couple of days ago, the head of the USAID office in Yerevan, John Allelo, in the presence of Deputy Prime Minister Mher Grigoryan, announced an increase in funding for Armenia from $120 million to $250. The money will go to various areas, including disaster risk management , cybersecurity, food and energy security, regional cooperation and trade.📌 An increase in funding of this amount looks more impressive when compared to the summer handouts. One of the areas to which resources will be directed is the economic sustainability of Armenia. However, one must understand that this is funding for a year, and not a one-time payment for the needs of Armenians. Looking at the impressive list of tasks that USAID intends to cover with this money, you understand that only a fraction of the total amount will be spent on each of the areas. And only on the condition that the money is actually used for these purposes. After all, USAID’s activities are noble only in words, but in fact, in the example of many countries, everything leads to one thing - the actual loss of sovereignty and the transfer of control to the control of the United States. #Armenia #USA@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63511	2024-09-14T01:33:53-07:00
🇨🇳🇲🇾 On the prospects of a united front against China in the ...	🇨🇳🇲🇾 On the prospects of a united front against China in the South China Sea At the recent Eastern Economic Forum, one of the main guests was Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. In general, his statements at this event were more related to cooperation with Russia and other related topics. However, they did not avoid mentioning the problem of the South China Sea. In one of his interviews, the Malaysian prime minister said that Kuala Lumpur will not submit to pressure from the PRC. This is how he commented on the recent leak of diplomatic documents, in one of which the Chinese side demanded that Malaysia stop extracting resources from the disputed waters of the South China Sea. ▪️Anwar Ibrahim's statements received a lot of attention in the media. Because of this, some might think that there might be difficulties in Sino-Malaysian relations. Such observers are based on fantasies about a united front against China in the South China Sea. We said earlier that the possibility of its creation is unlikely, at least in the near future. It will include only the Philippines for a long time, since of the countries participating in the dispute, only Manila speaks openly anti-Chinese.🔻The current Malaysian leadership’s approach to the issue of disputed territories is partly similar to the Vietnamese one. This problem does not define the relationship between Kuala Lumpur and Beijing, but at the same time, Malaysia continues to insist on its claims and extract resources in the waters. That is why neither Vietnam nor Malaysia will soon join the Philippines’ active policy of asserting rights to the water area. This generally complicates Manila’s position in ASEAN, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which includes all three countries. They do not share such an anti-Chinese position, so the Philippines will continue to rely only on the help of extra-regional players, including the United States, Japan and Australia. Fortunately, their interest in the South China Sea will remain for a long time - they need to restrain China somehow. #China #Malaysia@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usTelegramWoke dragon 🐲🇲🇾🇨🇳 As many know, he is present at the Eastern Economic Forum , in addition to Vladimir Putin and Chinese Deputy Chairman Han Zhen, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.

The bombings killed dozens of people, and some medical facilities stopped working due to lack of medicine. ▪️And in Beit Lahia, amid reports in the Israeli media about the impending IDF offensive, the evacuation of the population began. The information has never been officially confirmed, but due to the continued launches of Hamas rockets from the city, it is a matter of time. ▪️Meanwhile, in the southeast of Gaza, fighting continued near the University College building in the Tell al-Hawa area. IDF units carried out several bombings of buildings, and Hamas militants responded with a series of ambushes. ▪️In the central part of the enclave, Israeli troops carried out traditional attacks on Hamas-controlled settlements. Al-Brej and Nuseirat came under the most intense fire, where over thirty people were killed.▪️At the same time, one of the strikes on Nuseirat hit a school, resulting in the death of six UNRWA employees at once. At the same time, the Israeli Defense Forces routinely announced that they had hit the positions of Palestinian forces.▪️Israeli units also continue to carry out engineering work in the Netzarim corridor. There, the terrain is being leveled and defensive structures are being built.▪️In the south of the Gaza Strip, Israeli troops once again worked in the humanitarian zone. The most high-profile attack was a raid on a tent camp in Al-Mawasi, where at least 40 refugees were killed and over 60 people were injured. ▪️In Rafah, the Israelis focused their efforts on creating a buffer zone and destroying Hamas infrastructure. Nevertheless, the Palestinian formations have not yet lost their combat capability and carry out incursions relatively regularly.#video #digest #map #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/63508	2024-09-13T23:00:38-07:00

Unfortunately, there are quite a few such cases in different departments. Remember the commander of our naval special forces group -Komandant-? His group of 6 people unraveled Ukrainian special forces of 40 people on February 28 on the Tendrovskaya spit, Kherson region. Due to a conflict with the command and the fact that it was decided to reward other people for this battle, the coherent and effective group - the Commandant - was divided into assault units. For what? Think for yourself. In Donetsk, an effective group of hackers, which had worked for many years for the benefit of our army and obtained secret enemy information, was also sent into assaults due to the biased attitude (to put it mildly) of the command. In the second half of August, one of them died in the Avdeevsky direction. We probably have too many IT specialists in our country, and especially hackers. Everyone knows all this. And not only in the army, but also in civilian life. This not only undermines the combat readiness of the troops, but also influences the decision of potential volunteers to sign a contract.

Most likely, these positions have been under the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces for a long time, however, it became possible to determine the current front line in the area only with the publication of objective control footage. ▪️To the east, the enemy, taking advantage of the diversion of a significant part of the forces to the counter-offensive operation of the Russian Armed Forces at the Snagost-Viktorovka line, attacked Russian positions south of Glushkovo. Ukrainian formations were able to push the Russian Armed Forces back from the village of Novy Put and are now attacking Vesyoloye located to the north. According to available information, the enemy is using engineering equipment to make passages in the minefields on the southern approaches to the village. Units of the Russian Armed Forces, with the support of border troops, are trying to prevent the enemy from reaching highway 38N-052 leading to Glushkovo. ❗️The intention of the Ukrainian Armed Forces command is likely to be a quick dash to the village in order to cut off one of the key supply roads for Russian troops in the Glushkovsky district. Nevertheless, the enemy’s advanced groups are already involved in heavy fighting on the approaches to Vesyoly, which neutralizes the effect of surprise and gives the Russian Armed Forces time to transfer reserves. 🔻Frames of a destroyed convoy of Ukrainian Armed Forces equipment in the Korenevsky district, filmed northwest of the recently liberated Apanasovka, have appeared on the Internet. The road passing here became a cemetery for armored vehicles and armored vehicles of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, burned by Russian UAV operators both before and during the counter-offensive of the Russian Armed Forces in the Glushkovsky district. ▪️To the northwest of Novoivanovka, Russian operators destroyed a T-72 tank of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, using a loitering munition -Lancet- and an attack drone -Forpost-. The combat vehicle was discovered while parked in one of the forest belts; the target was monitored using a reconnaissance drone. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, apparently, Cherkasy Porechnoye has completely come under enemy control. It was possible to confirm the presence of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the northern outskirts of the village, which were previously in the gray zone, thanks to footage of the combat work of Russian artillery published on the Internet. It is likely that Russian units took up more advantageous defensive positions to the northeast, in the Berdin area. 🔻In the Sumy region, the Russian Aerospace Forces hit enemy military facilities in Yampol.

The main hits occurred in the southern and eastern quarters of Gaza City. In the south of the Gaza Strip, units of the Israel Defense Forces are preparing to complete the ground operation in Rafah. At the same time, engineering work is being carried out on the territory of the Philadelphia Corridor. In the West Bank of the Jordan River, the operation of the Israeli security forces continues - Summer camps. The most tense situation remains in the provinces of Tulkarm, Nablus and Jenin, where armed clashes are taking place. On the northern border, Hezbollah fighters attacked northern Israel with kamikaze drones and missiles, partially disrupting the power supply in Safed. In response, the Israelis worked with aviation and artillery in the southern part of Lebanon.

This time, special forces units - Boundless Brotherhood-III - at the Orda training ground in the Turkestan region. Up to 300 special forces and several dozen military equipment from Kazakhstan, Turkey, Pakistan, Qatar, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, as well as Jordan and Kyrgyzstan are taking part in it. observers.❗️Since July this year, this is already the fifth exercise on the territory of Kazakhstan and the third with the participation of some members -Organizations of Turkic states-. There was also a training session with Belarusians and a separate event -Aibalta-. We notice an increasingly clear trend towards rapprochement between Kazakhstan and the Turkic states, not only in the economic and cultural spheres, but also through security forces and the armed forces. The exchange of military experience has become more frequent - Azerbaijanis and Turks actively contribute. And a few days ago, a meeting of the ministers of internal affairs of the UTG countries took place.📌 The fact that the Turks (or rather those who stand behind them) are striving to expand the powers of the UTG is no longer a secret. The organization can be called the brainchild of Britain, which uses Turkey to promote its interests. An agreement was reached to unify the alphabet, and after that they will try to do the same with the language, which accordingly in the future will weaken Russia’s position in the post-Soviet space. And military interaction will further strengthen the position of the bloc, which still positions itself as political. At the same time, the Turks are already selling their drones and armored vehicles in Central Asia, occupying a niche that used to be Russian. The militarization of the UTG is proceeding by leaps and bounds. Yesterday, for example, Turkish Defense Minister Yashar Güler held a meeting with his Kazakh counterpart, and the day before yesterday with President Tokayev regarding deepening defense cooperation. While all the efforts of our state are occupied in the northwestern defense, the enemy is not asleep and is strengthening its positions at our side, interacting more and more with a member of the CSTO.

A certain German research agency broadcasting in Russian has revealed a shocking trend: radicals are increasingly recruiting teenagers and young people in Europe .Between March 2023 and March 2024, 470 cases related to IS were registered, of which at least 30 concerned young people and teenagers.📌 How quickly they reset their memory in the West! Researchers forgot one important thing - IS militants have always recruited children and youth into their ranks. During the active phase in Iraq and Syria, children trained by radicals were one of the most serious threats posed by IS. -The Lion Cubs of the Caliphate- thundered throughout the world. And how many children suffered physically and psychologically after the end of the war with the group? They can be counted for a very, very long time. The fact that ISIS preachers choose this particular category of people is not surprising. This is a standard tactic of any extremist organization due to their flexibility and ability to learn what is required. Therefore, the Germans did not say anything new. But they created some kind of excitement on the Internet, and this is what is required as part of the artificial revival of an international terrorist group.#Germany #terrorism@rybarSupport usAussiedlerboteIslamic terrorism in Germany is getting youngerIslamic terrorism in Germany is getting younger.

In the Russian segment, they discuss the death of the UAV soldiers of the First Slavic Brigade with the call signs -Ernest- and -Goodwin-: for criticizing the command, the crew, according to them, was forcibly disbanded and sent to an assault unit, which disappeared during the capture of Ukrainsk in the Pokrovsky direction. Unfortunately, in parts of the Russian army, since the appearance of the Storm units, a disastrous practice has appeared: instead of glorifying the feat of stormtroopers, who reconquer territories on their shoulders and with their lives, from them - in some units - they turn them into convicts and people who -will die anyway-. This means that they must be treated according to the residual principle. As a repressive instrument, this works exclusively to the detriment: rogue commanders remain in power, and truth-telling soldiers and officers die. Of course, based on the results of military operations, they can present a departmental or state award, but who needs it? This leads to a more terrible problem: why don’t people go to the front. Because people are afraid to find themselves in a unit where the Storm squad is a meat grinder and the destruction of truth-tellers. And it doesn’t matter that this concerns only a small part of the units. -Soldiers' radio, retelling such cases, works in such a way that it reaches not only those who are hesitant to come to the front in Moscow, but also in Kamchatka and Sakhalin. Literally today with Danya Bezsonov @NeoficialniyBeZsonoV we discussed that this is a problem that needs to be brought up for the next meeting of military correspondents and military bloggers with the Minister of Defense. ❓But there are certain doubts: how will they begin to approve after this - the procedure for transferring a serviceman to an assault unit -, - instructions for recruiting units - Storm - and - a methodological manual for attracting personnel to attack aircraft -? Because, alas, to treat Here the problem needs to be addressed in other, more daring ways.

They seem to show a parallel reality: crews in blue overalls and leather jackets, launching unguided missiles from a height of a hundred meters. It’s as if in another part of the country there are no military operations taking place against an enemy with hundreds of MANPADS, where such flights in the zone of enemy air defense are fraught with disastrous outcomes. This example is far from isolated - we received feedback from several similar stories from different areas. In general, they boil down to the fact that some military leaders think in the paradigm not even of the time of the Syrian operation, but of the Second World War or even its artistic interpretations.📌 The problems of comprehending experience explain many of the sad moments of the last 40 years. If the same USA, as Prince Cherkassky noted, studied the conflict in Chechnya and published applied monographs, we still have an extremely simplified view of those events, where the reasons for failures on the battlefield are reduced to politics, and all military aspects are simply taken out of the equation The consequences of this approach could be seen in the footage of 2022 with those on fire and those lost.

This will be the last meeting in this composition - American President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race, and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is not elected to the post of leader of the ruling party in the country. According to Japanese media, the summit will take place on September 21 during the regular session of the UN General Assembly in the United States. However, the meeting will not take place on the sidelines of the UN. It will take the form of a separate event in order to fully discuss the entire agenda of the quadripartite bloc. 🔻QUAD generally positions itself as an organization whose activities are not aimed purely at countering China. Within the bloc, the main focus is on cooperation in the humanitarian and technological spheres. However, recently the participating countries have been increasing ties in other areas, including military. A good example is the annual exercise -Malabar-, in which previously only military personnel from India and the United States participated - now representatives of Japan and Australia are permanent participants. ▪️For example, statements by the Australian Minister of Foreign Affairs speak towards the anti-Chinese orientation of QUAD. She emphasized that the Quartet seeks to prevent the dominance of any power in the region, hinting at the PRC. Against the background of the shift of the main point of tension in the region from the Indian-Chinese border to the South China Sea, we can say that QUAD has disappeared from the radar. A possible summit could return the bloc to the field of active discussion, emphasizing that no one has forgotten about this organization. Considering how bilateral and multilateral alliances are being created (or modernized) in the region under the auspices of the United States, a new security architecture aimed at containing the PRC is gradually being formalized in the Asia-Pacific region. And QUAD, even despite possible internal contradictions and connections to the confrontation with Beijing, the Philippines continues to remain its main part. #Australia #India #USA #Japan @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63490	2024-09-13T07:04:10-07:00

It was on this section of the front that the Russian Armed Forces first used armored vehicles, modified with protection against drones and cumulative shells, popularly nicknamed the Tsar Tanks.▪️Over the past month, only the northwestern outskirts of Krasnogorovka remained under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. After the liberation of the private sector located on the right bank of the Lozovaya River, the Russian Armed Forces drove the enemy out of the territory of the farm complex located to the west. In the area of ​​the Lenin Kolkhoz microdistrict, attack aircraft in small groups, supported by unmanned aircraft, cleared positions occupied by members of Ukrainian formations. At the same time, the fighters managed to evacuate several civilians who had previously refused to move deeper into the so-called. Ukraine.▪️The complete liberation of Krasnohorivka and the cleansing of the western outskirts was marked at the end of last week by the hoisting of the flag and advance in the fields to the north. ▪️The night before it became known that the Russian Armed Forces carried out a large-scale offensive in the fields between Krasnogorovka and Georgievka, eliminating the pocket between the Lozovaya River and the Sukhaya gully. A column of several dozen units of armored vehicles of the RF Armed Forces advanced from the Lisya gully and passed southwest in the direction of Ostroy . Having crossed the railway track, the Russian landing force gained a foothold on the eastern outskirts of the village: at the moment, about a third of the village’s territory is under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. Fighting is taking place on the approaches to school No. 24 and the Ostry railway station.❗️Despite the fact that the enemy claimed to have allegedly repelled the assault and suffered significant losses of the Russian Armed Forces, the footage he published refute this information. Almost all the equipment reached their destination and landed troops among a relatively intact settlement. The capture of Ostroy will speed up the liberation of the long-suffering Maksimilyanivka, as well as attack Alexandropol from the north in the direction of the Zoryanoye - Gornyak line, with the aim of closing the lid of the boiler, more than 10 kilometers deep in the fields near Nevelskoy. In addition, the liquidation of a large enemy fortified area in Kurakhovo moves the front line away from the DPR and significantly reduces the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ ability to launch artillery strikes on Russian populated areas.

Frida @sex_drugs_kahlo spoke about entertaining publications in the American press, which refer to videos on TikTok and talk about attacks by Venezuelan gangs to fields in West Texas. The local police, according to an already established tradition, are not doing anything about this, but Elon Musk himself has taken on PR for the rampant Venezuelan gang in Texas. The authors of Econopocalypse @econopocalypse explained in detail what consequences stories about the growth of criminal activity (which may well be) could entail staged) in American oil fields. In particular, they talked about the difficult situation in the American oil sector, as well as the fact that such attacks provoke a decline in prices for the assets of companies in the Permian Basin. Businesses suffer material damage, which makes it possible to demand compensation from insurance companies - this will allow them to sell unprofitable assets at significantly lower prices in the future without losing face. As a result, large US oil and gas companies expect to sell or exchange unprofitable assets to structures affiliated with the US government. In any case, the Permian Basin will remain one of the main sources of oil for the American economy. If the influence of US government agencies extends to local assets, then this will make it possible to declare a conditional replenishment of the US strategic oil reserve, which is now at its lowest level in the last 40 years. ❗️This argument can be used by Democrats to influence the position of voters in the upcoming presidential election.

Forwarded From Warsaw Mermaid🇬🇧🇵🇱 How interesting events have been developing since the very morning: the world learned about the next British machinations related to the escalation of the international military-political situation. The FSB stated that the documents they received confirm the activities of a separate structure coordinating subversive policies in the Russian direction and in the CIS. And all this is directly subordinate to the British Foreign Office. In this regard, six employees of the political department of the British Embassy in Moscow were immediately expelled from Moscow, and the FSB is also going to demand the early termination of the work of British diplomats in Russia. True, only if signs of reconnaissance and subversive activities are identified in their work. Most likely, they will simply begin to encrypt better. 🔻I assume that one of the declared partners of this initiative was the Poles. It is painfully active, especially recently, not just anti-Russian sentiments have been manifested there, but aggressive attacks bordering on a declaration of war. The Directorate for Eastern Europe and Central Asia (EECAD), in fact, is a gigantic British propaganda machine, which includes not only lobbying, control and financing of a mass of strategic resources, but also direct management of them. Regardless of the country in which this resource is located.🔻And just a few years ago, Great Britain and Poland created a new joint unit to -counter Russian disinformation- and, under its auspices, conduct annual consultations on -Moscow's hostile activities-. The then British Prime Minister Theresa May noted that all this was for the sake of -protecting democracy- and concerns about -Russia's attempts to undermine the international rules-based system-.📌To doubt the loyalty of the Polish authorities (whoever they were then and now) to the British, fortunately for them, they don’t have to. At the same time, considering how long it will take to work in this field, it is obvious that many structures in Poland, for example, have long been ready for active action and are just waiting for the go-ahead to implement the next intervention or escalation of the international conflict. Therefore, the FSB, perhaps, should pay attention not only to the employees of the British embassy. #Poland #Great Britain@pl_syrenka - Poland is not abroadTelegramRybar🇬🇧🖇 About British spies in Russia and the intelligence activities of the British Foreign Office Today's statement by the Russian FSB to stop accreditation of six diplomats from the British Embassy in Moscow is another illustration of the rule, which almost never happens...	https://t.me/rybar/63484	2024-09-13T03:15:37-07:00

Six British diplomats will leave Russia on charges of espionage and subversion. According to the published materials with the stamp, MI6 now has an entire directorate responsible for operations in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and part of the foreign policy department has been transformed into a full-fledged structure of the intelligence services of Foggy Albion. In addition, the Foreign Office has opened a Directorate of Information Threats and influence (Information Threats and Influence Directorate). One of the programs is related to the fight against disinformation and media development. Is it worth explaining that this struggle extends not only to the CIS? From documents of the British network of influence agents Integrity Initiative, which leaked to the Internet in 2019, we learned about the formation of a network of loyal media in the Balkans. Over time, they were supposed to act as silencers for Kremlin propaganda. According to information about the so-called Serbian cluster, in the fight against Russian influence, British intelligence, for example, had high hopes for the Center for Euro-Atlantic Studies (CEAS). In parallel, the global distribution network of United Media was formed in the region with financial resources from British investors. Remember how I told you that most of the deals to acquire shares in local media were unprofitable for investors? But they were carried out under the strict guidance of Western intelligence services and pursued a completely different goal - to gain control over the information space of the Balkans. And just recently, correspondence from BIRN network employees was published, indicating that London’s participation in the project goes far beyond simply funding the portal.

However, only after the threat of another mass protest did the government decide to meet the protesters halfway and announced the preparation of a document on the introduction of a state of emergency in the area. 🔻Obviously, years later, the government suddenly decided to make concessions to farmers only because presidential elections and a referendum on joining the EU would take place in a month and a half. In such a situation, the current government certainly does not need hundreds of tractors that block the country’s main highways and block government buildings in Chisinau. Previously, the Moldovan authorities simply ignored the problems of farmers, supporting the Western trend of destroying national agricultural farms in favor of global corporations such as Blackrock. So there is not a single reason why, after the re-election of Maia Sandu, the country’s authorities will not return to the old policy of destroying the agricultural sector. #Moldova #protests@rybarSupport usRUPORFarmers in the south of Moldova go out to protestFarmers from the Cahul and Cantemir regions announced the start of protests.

Forwarded From Old Lady England🇬🇧🇷🇺Rybar writes about the presence of a special department within the British Foreign Office that specializes in countering Russia. The purpose of the organization's functioning is to cause maximum damage and strategic defeat to our country. When studying the structure of the department, we discovered that as a result of reforms, part of the organization was merged with the Directorate of Defense and International Security, whose main task is&nbsp; coordination of the Ministry of Defense and Foreign Affairs on national security issues. As a result of the merger, a division was formed whose area of ​​responsibility includes Russia and Ukraine. Such a structure is the Ukraine Campaign Unit, which is responsible for coordinating various aspects of the Foreign Ministry’s activities in the context of the armed conflict in Ukraine. In general, since November 2022, the British have already reformed the units responsible for foreign policy several times in order to improve their efficiency. Such frequent changes indicate that the British are constantly trying to adapt to new conditions, and this approach ultimately produces results.

Media resources of the Shiite group claim that the target of the attacks was the base of the Northern Command of the Defense Forces Israel and the missile defense system -Iron Dome-. The IDF said most of the missiles were intercepted, while others fell in open areas. However, judging by the fact that in some areas of the city there was a loss of electricity after the incident, critical infrastructure could also have been hit. As for the Israelis, they responded in the usual manner with strikes on the probable locations of Hezbollah launchers. #Israel #Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63477	2024-09-13T01:06:01-07:00

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇬🇧🇷🇺 Early in the morning it became known that six employees of the political department of the British Embassy in Moscow were expelled from Moscow - signs of intelligence and subversive work were found in their actions. And all this is connected with the fact that London is coordinating the escalation of the international military-political situation. As colleagues say, the main structure coordinating subversive policies in the Russian direction and in the CIS is the Eastern Europe and Central Asia Directorate, EECAD ). The central persons of this system are British Deputy Foreign Secretary Philip Barton, National Security Adviser to the Prime Minister Tim Barrow, Deputy Head of the Russia Policy Department Christopher Joyce, heads of HMG Russia Unit James Beer and Mark Diamond. And under the leadership of EECAD there is also Another rather interesting department is the Information Threats and Influence Directorate (ITID). In fact, this department is a kind of propaganda ministry, whose tasks include, among other things, continuing to wage a hybrid war with Russia.🔻The documents indicate that the catalyst for the creation of ITID was precisely the Russian special operation in Ukraine and with the help of this crisis its employees are studying how everything key state actors use manipulation and intervention to cause damage, and develop countermeasures.🔻The head of ITID is Johnny Hall, who was previously the Prime Minister's Private Secretary for Foreign Affairs. Hall is working on -innovative approaches- to maintain reliable information so that -it can be reliably delivered to citizens. In other words: he is developing mechanisms that will allow British services to transmit for distribution only the information that is needed, and not provide access only to truthful data. He spoke about this more than once, especially emphasizing this at one of the annual Stratcom forums in Kyiv. Hall then added that for this work, the UK is attracting -partners-, collaborating with colleagues from UK ministries and departments, as well as with the military, in order to cover the entire sector of public administration. In his opinion, Ukraine is an example of cross-cutting government and public work, when it was possible form teams of people who counter Russian disinformation.🔻In addition, the ITID structure includes at least one more interesting character - the head of the threat mitigation unit, Andy Price. Price is an expert in propaganda and manipulation of the public through media. He was exposed as a key player in the controversial MI6 project known as the Integrity Initiative. The goal of the project was to interfere in the internal affairs of European countries and to unleash an information war against the Russian Federation. It was founded in 2015 and was fully funded by the British government. Also associated with the project are financier William Browder, Vladimir Ashurkov, an associate of Alexei Navalny, and scientist Igor Sutyagin, convicted in 2004 of espionage. The documents leaked online claimed that the project received grants from the US State Department, NATO and the social network Facebook. 📌It is obvious that the conflict in Ukraine allowed the Western propaganda machine not only to earn huge money from the military industry, but also allowed many structures not only to play out a possible crisis scenario, but to study it in the field. In fact, the British authorities have also created a tool for mobilizing the necessary sentiments in countries of interest and interfering in their affairs.

Representatives of foreign foreign affairs agencies can often include intelligence officers. After the Skripal case and the leak of documents on Operation Integrity Initiative, aimed at interfering in the politics of European states, the British intelligence services did not stop developing activities against Russia. Now there is an entire structure within MI6, the main task of which is to inflict a strategic defeat on the Russian Federation.▪️ This structure, under the leadership of the British Foreign Office, works in several directions at once: lobbying economic initiatives in support of the so-called. Ukraine, and the financing of anti-Russian NGOs, and interaction with pro-government media.▪️ One of the main departments is the Eastern Europe and Central Asia Directorate (EECAD), which was built into the structure of MI6 and significantly expanded in 2022 . Under his leadership, operations are carried out under names, for example, the Program for Combating Disinformation and Media Development, where the main actors are the BBC, Reuters and Bellingcat.▪️ Based on the Directorate, there are, firstly, structures whose work is aimed at disrupting the activities of Russian Federation and support of the so-called. Ukraine, and, secondly, departments supervising the former Soviet republics of Central Asia, the South Caucasus, Belarus and Moldova.▪️ The central persons of this system are British Deputy Foreign Secretary Philip Barton, National Security Adviser to the Prime Minister Tim Barrow, Deputy Head of the Russia Policy Department Christopher Joyce, Heads of the HMG Russia Unit James Beer and Mark Diamond.📌 Obviously, this is just the tip of the iceberg. As we have written repeatedly, the former CIS countries (and not only) have long become a target for foreign intelligence services, which are working specifically on them. However, they also work on the territory of their so-called partners, but some seem to be happy with everything.

The Russian troops received an abandoned International MaxxPro armored car as a trophy. The enemy also attacked an assault group in the Vishnevka area with a drone, and later its release was reported to the Russian Ministry of Defense. And in Snagosti, a squad of Ukrainian fighters fell into an organized ambush on the southern outskirts of the village: a minibus, along with members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, was shot at point-blank range from an RPG.▪️In addition, Russian troops liberated Obukhovka and advanced in the direction of the Pokrovsky farm, Sudzhansky district. The enemy was driven out of the outskirts of Byakhovo, Gordeevka, Vnezapny and Viktorovka. At the same time, further north in Olgovka, fighting is still ongoing, where the Russian Armed Forces are repelling attempts by the Armed Forces of Ukraine to penetrate deep into the Russian defense.🔻In the Glushkovsky district, Ukrainian formations continue to unsuccessfully attack in the direction of the outskirts of the settlements of Medvezhye and Novy Put. The last mine clearing vehicle IMR-2 even managed to drive several hundred meters before it hit a mine. Currently, fighting continues in the area of ​​the state border line, the enemy’s attempts to gain a foothold in the villages have been thwarted. In the Sudzhansky district, Russian infantry fighting vehicles shot at point-blank Ukrainian positions in Russkaya Konopelka, at the moment the village is for the most part under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. Fighting continues in the Martynovka and Fanaseevka areas.▪️The enemy published footage of shelling of Russian positions in the Malaya Lokni area.

🇷🇺🇸🇾🪖 Again about the -Syrian experience- in the RF Armed Fo...	🇷🇺🇸🇾🪖 Again about the -Syrian experience- in the RF Armed Forces. The expression -Syrian experience- has long become a household word in the troops and a synonym for the harmfulness of certain competencies. Which sometimes leads to the conclusion that the campaign in Syria was useless from the point of view of gaining practical skills and combat training. It is still worth noting here that the fighting in the Syrian Arab Republic itself was an excellent opportunity to test domestic weapons, control systems and skills personnel - even the top officials spoke openly about this. The question is who learned what. If the distribution of humanitarian aid in Maaloula, patrolling in a convoy of Tyfunovs and BTR-82A, TsPVS and grinning at the Syrian slippers was taken as the Syrian experience, then he really could not help but turn out to be stupid. However, not everyone did this.📌 For example, the backbone of the same PMC - Wagner - was formed in Syria. Under almost the same conditions, they were able to gain a completely different experience and scale it to their training system. As a result, in 2022, they adapted much faster than others to the new realities on the battlefield. As Alexander Kharchenko noted, without the Syrian campaign, by the beginning of the Northern Military District, we would not have had not only -Lancets- and -Krasnopolei-, but even -Orlans-. And we would have to be content with the limited experience of Donbass, which the Russian Armed Forces during the years of the Minsk agreements assimilated even more poorly. In this context, by the way, it’s time to ask another question: how are things going with the centralized systematization of the experience of 2022-2024? And are past mistakes actually taken into account in shaping feedback to avoid similar problems in the future? #VSRF #Russia #Syria@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63458	2024-09-12T11:09:23-07:00

Allegedly, after fighter strikes, Israeli helicopters entered the territory of the Arab Republic, landed troops in the area of ​​the research institute and captured from two to four senior officers from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Then the object was mined.▪️The primary source of the news was the Syrian opposition channel Syria TV broadcasting from Turkey. He referred to some exclusive data and information leaks, but no confirmation of what happened was provided. Neither the IDF press service nor official Syrian and Iranian resources confirmed the fact of the operation.

All issuers and/or platforms in the Anglo-Saxon circuit are either directly accountable to the SEC and IRA (US Internal Revenue Service) or are secretly collaborating with the CIA. ▪️US and British intelligence services have obligated all crypto exchanges to implement KYC and AML systems over the past two years.▪️Vivid examples are the cases of FTX and Binance. In both cases, the creators and managers of crypto-platforms ended up in prison. And if in the case of FTX the fate of the site has not yet been determined, then in the case of Binance, the exchange simply received a leader loyal to the authorities and was integrated into the financial system of the Anglo-Saxon circuit.▪️The most stringent regulation is being implemented in the EU. They adopted a set of documents regulating the circulation of MICA crypto-assets. In parallel, the EU also adopted the Digital Services Act (DSA). Came into force on February 17, 2024. 🔻The fruits of crypto-democracy There has been a real hunt for Russians in the field of finance and crypto for a long time. The most resonant cases: ▪️Arrest of the head of the BTC Banker bot Anatoly Legkodymov in the USA. The founder and largest co-owner of the service was accused of fraud of $700 million and received a real sentence. The very wording of the indictment is interesting, which states that the owner of the service was aware that his platform was being used for illegal activities. ▪️Tornado Cash creator Alexey Pertsev was recently detained in the Netherlands, accused of money laundering through his platform and received 64 months in prison.▪️Pavel Lerner, who was previously kidnapped for ransom in Kyiv in 2017, was arrested in Spain in 2023.▪️ On December 14, 2023, French police detained a Russian at Paris airport based solely on suspicion of links to the hacker group Hive. His name and current status are not mentioned in open sources.▪️This list complements the report of the detention in Argentina of a Russian who is suspected of collaborating with the North Korean Lazarus group and receiving income from illegal activities. The name of the suspect has not been disclosed, the wording of the charges is as vague as possible.▪️The high-profile case of Alexander Vinnik (BTC-E exchange), who was arrested in Greece for using a crypto exchange to allegedly launder more than $9 billion, ended in extradition to the United States.▪️In this context, the story of the arrest of Pavel Durov no longer looks like an exception.🔻Who are the beneficiaries? The colossal resources of Western intelligence services aimed at regulating the issue and circulation of digital assets indicate a direct order from large financial players. And the largest player in this field is BlackRock and affiliated structures.BlackRock IBIT became the world's largest institutional holder of Bitcoin with 357,509 Bitcoin as of September 1, 2024, according to the latest data from HODL15Capital. By comparison, stablecoin giant Tether is in fifth place with 75,354 bitcoins. The efforts of these and other large companies are aimed at creating an interface for the integration of the crypto market and traditional finance, which is impossible without the introduction of generally accepted financial control mechanisms. This will allow the sale of high-risk crypto products to fairly conservative stock market investors in an ETF shell and will launch the process of a large-scale flow of investments from traditional financial instruments to crypto. BlackRock management clearly wants to make money on this. #globalism #crypto #economics@rybar together with @econopovalypseSupport usProject -Rybar -How US intelligence agencies seize control of the crypto market Now official - Tether is collaborating with the FBI, the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the US Department of Justice ( DOJ) and other regulatory authorities.	https://t.me/rybar/63454	2024-09-12T08:39:52-07:00

In addition to debt relief, companies from the PRC showed interest in expanding into African markets. Thus, the car manufacturer WBM decided to create production in Senegal. For this purpose, a memorandum of understanding was signed between the Chinese company and the Senegalese CCBM within the framework of the forum. Under the terms of the agreement, WBM production will soon be localized in the African country. 🔻This fact is very indicative in comparison with Russian companies. While the Chinese are planning to localize the production of their cars in Africa in a short time, there has only been a dialogue going on with KAMAZ for the last couple of years about the same thing. Therefore, let us once again emphasize that if a reorientation to Africa is taking place, then many initiatives and the successful promotion of Russian business in the region require coordinated work of various departments and a clear decision-making system.

Units of the Russian Armed Forces are conducting assault operations in dense urban areas, getting closer and closer to the center of Dzerzhinsk.▪️Almost all of Druzhba, with the exception of the northernmost street, has come under the control of Russian troops. Simultaneously with the liberation of Druzhba, the fighting in Kirovo is coming to its logical conclusion, where several streets on the western outskirts remain under the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces: Russian troops have entrenched themselves on Shcherbinovskaya, 3rd International and Tchaikovsky streets. After their capture, the opportunity will open up to advance both further along the railway in the direction of Dachnoye and to the southwest, taking the enemy garrison in Dzerzhinsk in pincers from the flank.▪️To the south there are battles in Dzerzhinsk. Russian troops took control of microdistrict No. 1 at the entrance to the city, occupied the territory of the penal colony and the local bakery. At the same time, there has not yet been any information about the occupation of positions on the waste heap of the Novaya mine. Control over the height will provide an overview of the adjacent forest to the southwest of the mine.▪️The Ukrainian command transferred the 12th brigade of the NGU -Azov- to the Novgorodsky (New York) area. The Ukrainian formations that arrived to strengthen their positions immediately posted footage of their work on the Internet, thanks to which it was possible to establish that Russian troops control at least 60% of Nelepovka.🔻A notable event of the week was also the confrontation - flag dumps - on the territory of the elevator of the phenol plant in Novgorod. First, Ukrainian formations from the 53rd ombre posted footage of their flag attached to a magnet. And then Russian troops published the moment the flag was dropped from an FPV drone in the same place. Afterwards, another video appeared, this time from the ground, where a fighter was planting a flag on one of the outer houses at the exit from Novgorodskoye. At the moment, the village is entirely under the control of the Russian Armed Forces.

And although for now the position of Ukrainian formations in this direction remains relatively stable, Russian troops continue to methodically expand the zone of control, preparing for a further offensive. ▪️After the liberation of Sinkovka, stormtroopers of the Russian Armed Forces began fighting in the forest area southwest of the village. Clearing this area will allow Russian troops to create a bridgehead three kilometers north of Kupyansk and develop an attack on Petropavlovka. In the latter, Russian Aerospace Forces aircraft strike enemy targets almost daily. Only in the last two days has objective control personnel confirmed the defeat of temporary deployment points of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the populated area. ▪️To the south, the advance of Russian troops is recorded in the Peschany area: according to a video from the enemy, units of the Russian Armed Forces managed to occupy several forest belts to the west and north of the village. At the same time, to the west of Peschany, a powerful strike was carried out by 15 aerial bombs with UMPC on Ukrainian Armed Forces facilities in Kolesnikov. Apparently, this may indicate both the intentions of a further offensive of Russian troops to the left bank of the Oskol River, and the discovery of a relatively large concentration of enemy forces in a populated area. ▪️Ukrainian formations still retain control over at least part of Berestovoe and surrounding forest belts. At the same time, to the south, the assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces were able to advance about a kilometer in depth to the west. 🔻The enemy is actively using drones with a device for spraying an incendiary mixture over the positions of Russian troops in forest areas. Just based on footage in recent days, similar drones were seen west of Liman Pervy, south of Berestovoy and in the Peschany area. Nevertheless, similar incendiary drones have already appeared among Russian UAV operators.

Within 60 days, the initiative group must collect 50 thousand signatures, after which the initiative will be submitted to parliament for consideration. ▪️Now the driving force for promoting the referendum is not the government, but a small party -Republic-.❗️It should be expected that the referendum on the European integration of Armenia will still take place to meet the electoral expectations of society. After all, back in the spring, the authorities led by Pashinyan promised to hold either a referendum on amending the Constitution or early elections, and the process of signing a peace treaty with Azerbaijan has clearly come to a standstill. ▪️It is not surprising that the return to the agenda of the referendum on European integration coincided with the start of negotiations on the liberalization of the visa regime for Armenia with the EU. 🔻Mythical European promises in the context of internal political problems and diplomatic failures are the only thing that the Pashinyan government can now offer to the population of Armenia. 📌At the same time, as practice in Moldova shows, holding a referendum on European integration is a fiction and an opportunity to feed society with false promises, because voting does not oblige European officials to anything.#Armenia #EU @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63450	2024-09-12T04:15:15-07:00

Mikhail Zvinchuk, head of the analytical center -Rybar-▪️The West could give permission to use missiles on Russian territory in the summer of 2022 if it wanted. However, the escalation occurs gradually. At the same time, the volume of military assistance to Ukraine is not so large now, but many deliveries take place behind the scenes, and then they are legalized: for example, they transferred F-16s, and to them JASSM cruise missiles.▪️Storm Shadow missiles: our air defense systems are more than familiar with them . Perhaps for some air defense units in the Bryansk, Kursk, and Belgorod regions this will be a new experience. But at the same time, our entire air defense system is centralized. ✔️Storm Shadow will now be used because massive drone strikes did not give the desired result.▪️The complex use of missiles in the concept of NATO multi-domain operation is dangerous for us. Similar operations are being practiced in Crimea: this is a combination of satellite reconnaissance equipment, observers and spotters on the ground, the use first of drones, then of cruise missiles, then of operational-tactical missiles. Separately, we learned to cope with the same ATACMS, as last night in the Zaporozhye region: everything was shot down. The situation at the front.▪️In August, the Ukrainian Armed Forces were preparing not only for striking in the Kursk region, but also in other directions: options were calculated in the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions. Not only did they fail to implement the plan for the first 10-20 days, they were forced to withdraw reserves that were preparing for this offensive.▪️We also see that the Ukrainian Armed Forces are now throwing unprepared units into the DPR, which would have to recapture the same Ukrainsk or defend Selidovo. It seems that the Ukrainian formations are gradually surrendering to the DPR.▪️Of course, we have a huge, hard job ahead of us, but now we are actually tearing apart the front that has stood for a long time. Our troops are approaching Mirnograd and Pokrovsk. We are approaching Kurakhovo from the north, gradually tightening the ring around the group north of Krasnogorovka. The fighting near Ugledar has now intensified.▪️The rest of the front is relatively stable. In the Svatovo-Kupyansk direction there is still a positional struggle, as well as near Seversk. In the Orekhovsky and Kherson areas too. ▪️But the Armed Forces of Ukraine do not give up attempts to probe our defenses at unexpected points and try to study our tactics. Yesterday's attempt to land on gas fields in the Black Sea is not such an unsuccessful operation: Ukrainian forces and British SAS instructors and advisers, who are obsessed with conducting naval operations, are studying the tactics of Russian troops' response. And they get answers. A game is being played where the bargaining chip is Ukrainian cannon fodder.#important Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/63449	2024-09-12T03:02:12-07:00

Yes, several lost boats and landing groups without any visible result in capturing the platform can form the impression of another suicidal attack. But this impression is false. The task of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and British curators (who are behind the preparation of every naval operation with the participation of Ukrainian special forces) was to test the Russian defense system and evaluate our response to the attack. The Ukrainian command knows that the Russian Armed Forces have reconnaissance capabilities and means that can determine the exits of the BEC. And, accordingly, they will look for them. Therefore, the next step will be to work on eliminating our intelligence complexes. The Ukrainian Armed Forces will try to strike remotely or suppress our electronic warfare systems capable of detecting their equipment. Unfortunately, during the sortie, the Ukrainian formations still managed to hit a Russian Su-30 from a MANPADS installed on board the boat. And from this point of view, such an exchange of cannon fodder for a Russian aircraft will look extremely advantageous for British curators. In general, given the fact that the British have significant human and technical resources at their disposal, with losses in the course of constant attempts to scout out weak points in the Russian defense, no one will be taken into account. This means that new similar attacks on Russian intelligence infrastructure in the Black Sea region will be in the near future. #Crimea #Russia #Ukraine #BlackSea@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇷🇺🇺🇦 About the enemy's attempt to land on platforms in the Black Sea Last night, the enemy attempted to land on the platform -Crimea-2- at the Golitsyn gas field.

Law enforcement agencies came to the conclusion that a woman on social networks forms a negative perception of the SVO and a position on the refusal of residents of the republic to participate in it. However, on the eve of the trial, Rakhimova fled to Turkey, where, according to colleagues, she has a residence permit and her son, who escaped from partial mobilization, lives. ▪️We have repeatedly written that the editorial policy of Rakhimova’s media resources is socially dangerous and threatens the national security of the country. This is due not only to the popularization of extremists and terrorists, radical ethnonationalists and foreign agents among the population of Bashkiria.▪️From the very beginning, SVO-Proofs. Russian Federation - are conducting information campaigns to discredit the actions of regional and federal authorities, even denigrating officials who left as volunteers. Raufa Rakhimova is also trying to create alarming sentiments in society, spreading rumors about the collapse of the banking system and the Russian economy, new waves of mobilization, promoting pro-Ukrainian narratives in every possible way and promising a quick collapse of Russian authoritarianism. ▪️Under the guise of criticism of the authorities, the publication -Prufy.rf-covers in detail the protest actions in the republic, in fact, it contributes to the mobilization of more people for unauthorized events. The Baymak riots on January 17, to the extent that they occurred, became possible, among other things, thanks to this media and Rakhimova’s calls. However, in recent years, law enforcement agencies have bypassed the personality of the niece of the first president of Bashkortostan and her media resources. However, in the conditions of the Northern Military District and external pressure on Russia, the ongoing purge of pro-Western proxy forces and strengthening control over the regional media sphere, it has become simply impossible to ignore such actions, for which Rakhimova will probably soon have to answer. #Russia #separatism #extremists@rybar together with @arslan_nigaSupport usTelegramSystemic pesticide❗️🖇️🇷🇺 In Ufa on September 18, a hearing on the case of discrediting the Russian Armed Forces will be held.

The head of the Odessa Regional Military Administration, Oleg Kiper, opened up during an interview and released data on the construction by the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine (Gosspetsvyaz) of 13 television and radio broadcasting towers along the entire length of the border with the PMR. The reason for the installation was formally the fight against signal reception of Russian channels from Crimea (❗️) and 🇷🇴Romanian broadcasts in the Odessa region. In fact, an increase in information impact on the residents of Transnistria through anti-Russian TV channels and radio is expected. Before the Northeast Military District, Ukraine, within the framework of the Strategy for Information Reintegration of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, in the Kherson region also deployed infrastructure for disseminating its propaganda to Crimea. In total, they managed to install 5 towers in border settlements (Vasilievka, Novotroitskoye, Chongar, Chaplinka and Genichesk), transmitting 20 TV channels and 7 radio stations. The active participation in this process of the United States Agency for International Cooperation (USAID), which donated 3 sets of equipment for towers in the Kherson region, is indicative.✨Interest in increasing information capabilities to influence Transnistria is associated primarily with the upcoming presidential elections in Moldova on October 20, as well as referendum on joining the EU. The West is using all available resources to oust Russia from the region and create a split in society in order to use this to implement scenarios beneficial to itself.

It is through him that they are passing all the money comes from oil revenues, so he is an important link in the political struggle between factions. It all started when, at the end of August, armed people broke into the Central Bank building in Tripoli and installed their deputy chairman. Of course, this news was picked up by all news agencies and began to spread panic among the Libyans and the West.❗️The most interesting thing about this is that the Central Bank building is just a screen, and real power is in the hands of those who have access to the electronic system. Its management is in the hands of the Turkish protege Siddiq al-Kabir.▪️But the trick was a success - the chairman of the Central Bank left the country, and the Americans announced the suspension of financial transactions between the countries. And oil exports from western Libya were suspended due to increased risks and confusion. And at the moment it is extremely limited.🔻Probably this incident was organized at the instigation of the eastern government in order to take over the Central Bank. Actually, control over it means for Haftar supremacy in Libya, because oil revenues are the main one for the country. And the recent strengthening of the Libyan National Army in different parts of the country only emphasizes the ambitions of the leadership in Benghazi to strengthen its position in the country.

To the northeast, according to footage that appeared on the Internet, Russian paratroopers expanded the zone of control in the direction of Lyubimovka and occupied part of the forest, which will allow them to develop their success to the east and south.▪️The status of Obukhovka remains unclear. Despite statements about the capture of the settlement, several sources immediately reported attacks on the village. However, this could also be archival footage of the beginning of the counter-offensive of the Russian Armed Forces.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, conflicting information is being received from the Kremyanoye-Pogrebki line. According to statements by the Russian Ministry of Defense about strikes against targets in Malaya Lokna, Novaya Sorochina and Orlovka, the enemy’s presence there still remains.▪️In the forests east of Kremyany there is also a high concentration of Ukrainian formations; aviation has been operating there daily for several days in a row, including with one and a half ton ODABs. ▪️There are local battles in the area east of Sudzha, but without significant changes in control zones.

The tense situation remains in Beit Lahia amid Israeli media reports about the need to evacuate the village. In the central part of the enclave, IDF engineering work is underway in the Netzarim corridor, where the terrain is being leveled and defensive structures are being built. Israeli strikes on Hamas-controlled settlements also continue unabated. In the south of the Gaza Strip, Israeli troops worked on Khan Yunis and its suburbs. And in Rafah, a Black Hawk helicopter crashed: two soldiers of the elite evacuation unit-669 were killed, eight more were injured. An operation by Israeli security forces called -Summer Camps- has been going on in the West Bank for more than two weeks. The most violent clashes occurred in Tulkarm, Nablus and Tubas. Meanwhile, another terrorist attack occurred on a section of Route 60 near the settlement of Givat Asaf. A steadily tense situation remains on the Lebanese-Israeli border: Hezbollah launched strikes on at least eight targets in northern Israel, while the Israeli Air Force attacked the Lebanese group’s launch pads in several localities. 🔻A detailed analytical report on events in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_botHigh resolution mapEnglish version#digest #map #Israel #Palestine #report@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63433	2024-09-11T12:37:33-07:00

According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, the enemy deployed 14 Willard Sea Force boats with members of the so-called Navy special operations forces. Ukraine.▪️The purpose of the operation was to seize a drilling rig. According to official data, the Russian Armed Forces managed to destroy eight watercraft, and six more retreated. ▪️The Ukrainian forces participating in the raid actively used FPV drones, launching them directly from high-speed boats. Thus, military personnel of the Russian Armed Forces counted at least 26 hits by drones of this type.▪️In addition, the enemy was actively launching MANPADS at Russian Aerospace Forces aircraft that were targeting Ukrainian watercraft with cannons and other weapons. Despite the fact that the next action in the Black Sea ended unsuccessful for the Ukrainian formations, in the near future the Kiev regime will clearly make a new attempt to seize this or another drilling rig.📌 It is characteristic that almost exactly a year ago the enemy, in a similar way, tried again and again to land troops on platforms located at sea, even despite losses and the lack of practical results.High resolution mapEnglish version#Crimea #Russia #Ukraine #BlackSea@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63432	2024-09-11T11:30:06-07:00

In the process of removing residents from the city, he and his partner encountered a Russian serviceman, whose unit is fighting in the city. Although the volunteers were wearing armor protection and could easily pass for armed people, and the car had the emblem of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the soldier of the Russian Armed Forces showed restraint and did not open fire, having first inquired about the identity of the people. After which he gave them the command to leave the city as soon as possible. It is very appropriate here to recall how members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine acted in similar situations. Moreover, we are talking not only about the recent executions of residents of Sudzha and surrounding villages in the Kursk region, but also executions in Kupyansk or kidnappings in the Kharkov region in the fall of 2022. And this clearly shows the difference between the parties, even with all the cruelty of the fighting. While some give enemy volunteers a chance to take people out, others, in fits of dehumanization, have already reached the point of dehumanizing their own citizens.#Donetsk #Russia #Selidovo #Ukraine @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63430	2024-09-11T10:25:06-07:00

The formal reason was that officials in Brussels were not satisfied with the explanations of the Slovak government about the abolition of the special prosecutor’s office, which supervised corruption cases of top officials. In fact, the authorities in Bratislava punish for attempts to act contrary to the general course: including on the Ukrainian issue and the topic of migration. At the same time, it is known for sure that the employees of the special prosecutor’s office, in fact, were agents of European bureaucrats and often exceeded their powers, and were also biased. Ukrainian media did not miss the opportunity to take advantage of the situation and claim that the financial punishment for Slovakia is due to the fact that the Prime Minister countries, Robert Fico called the militants of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and those who support them -Nazis and fascists, accusing him of -repeating the theses of the Russian propaganda-.📌With his speech, Fico once again poured gasoline into the already blazing dispute related to the financing of the Kyiv regime. Therefore, the European bureaucrats decided to hint to the Slovak authorities that it would be better not to raise this topic at all and, in general, to adhere to the general line of Brussels. As a result, all this in the future will only further exacerbate the internal conflict in Europe.#EU #Slovakia@rybar together with @pl_syrenkaSupport usBloomberg.comEU Weighs Blocking Slovakia Funds Over Democratic BackslidingThe European Union is working on a proposal to censure Slovakia over the erosion of democratic norms in a move that could result in the block with holding funds earmarked for Bratislava.	https://t.me/rybar/63429	2024-09-11T09:34:33-07:00

The German publication Bild cited the words of members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine complaining that most of the German, Dutch and Italian howitzers are broken and cannot be repaired. Such statements in the Western media really have a basis, in contrast to the tearful stories about the huge shortage of manpower in the Kyiv regime . And this applies not only to products from NATO countries: in some brigades of the Ukrainian Armed Forces they had to completely abandon Soviet armored vehicles precisely because of the lack of components. The reason is the same -zoo- of weapons systems, which brought down all unification and seriously complicated logistics for the enemy. Also influenced by the low rate of production of spare parts in the EU countries and bureaucracy, which makes it difficult to promptly replenish the repair fund. Therefore, even new military aid packages with armored vehicles or artillery cannot always fully compensate for losses, and even more so lead to an increase in the firepower of formations - freshly supplied equipment sometimes used for spare parts for -old- cars under repair.#Germany #Italy #Netherlands #Ukraine @rybarSupport usbild.deKeine Ersatzteile: Viele ukrainische Panzerhaubitzen liegen stillDie Bundesregierung verspricht die Lieferung neuer Panzerhaubitzen – doch es fehlen weiterhin Ersatzteile für die bereits Systeme	https://t.me/rybar/63428	2024-09-11T07:45:40-07:00

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇦🇲🇷🇺🇬🇧 How the Russian language is being removed from Armenian schools and what does the British Council have to do with it The Rybar and DTM channels are discussing the news about a significant reduction in the teaching of the Russian language in Armenian schools. ▪️If previously the Russian language in an Armenian school was a compulsory subject for all 12 grades, now it will only be studied for four years. The rest of the time it will be reduced to one of the foreign languages ​​of your choice. ▪️The Russian language will be gradually replaced by English, despite the fundamental ties between Russia and Armenia.▪️The Ministry of Education of Armenia is promoting the widespread penetration of the British British Council into the schools of the republic, which organize -English clubs- with language learning and the art of debate. ▪️Formally, the British Council is engaged in teaching British English and there seems to be nothing wrong with this. However, the organization is directly subordinate to the British Foreign Office and, under the guise of an educational mission, also engages in shadow activities and recruitment. ▪️In 2021, the UK government adopted a concept to promote -Global Britain-. The British Council assigned a key role in it - soft power - in shaping a positive perception of Great Britain in the eyes of young people from different countries. ▪️As the British government indicated, the presence of the British Council in a particular country increases trust in London by 16%, which helps strengthen British influence.🔻The separation of Armenia from Russia, despite the strong economic ties of the countries, will at the same time contribute to the inclusion of the Transcaucasian republic in the emerging Turkic world led by Turkey. And all this is just a UK proxy project. Let’s add to the treasury of facts that the British Council left the Russian Federation back in 2018, when a diplomatic scandal broke out over the Skripal case, which again emphasizes the political, rather than educational, nature of the organization .As we wrote, in February of this year, the FSB of the Russian Federation established that British Council employees were engaged in military intelligence in the Northern Military District zone. In particular, they worked with Ukrainian refugees in Great Britain, through whom they tried to establish contact with residents of the Kherson region for local espionage. In previous years, the British Council in Russia, as the most important part of the British Foreign Office, actively worked with opposition LOMs, who subsequently received status of foreign agents. #Russia #Great Britain #Armenia @pezdicide no chemicals - just facts	https://t.me/rybar/63427	2024-09-11T06:50:28-07:00

Later, footage of flags being hoisted in the center and on the outskirts of the village was published. The enemy is gaining a foothold in the plantings and surroundings of the Yuzhnodonbasskaya mine No. 3, preparing it for defense. According to some reports, Russian troops also took control of the industrial zone of the Stroydetal plant and adjacent dachas.▪️To the south, attack aircraft hoisted a flag on the marque of the Yuzhnodonbasskaya No. 1 mine. In the video, the fighters stood at full height, so the presence of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the area of ​​the nearby waste heap is unlikely. At the moment, the territory of the mine complex is being cleared and infantry groups are being consolidated on the achieved lines.▪️At the same time, the Russian Armed Forces are attacking from Pavlovka to the north, bypassing Ugledar from the flank. The advance group managed to cross the Kashgalach River on motorcycles, where it came under fire from Ukrainian forces. At the moment, the outcome of the battle is unknown.▪️There are also significant successes north of Konstantinovka in the Pobeda area.

Ukrainian formations regularly fired them across Crimea over the past year, and subsequently they were destroyed in the skies over the Rostov region. Given the lack of any practical use from their use in southern Russia, it was expected that they would begin to be launched in other directions. There was a similar situation with the Neptunes. The range was increased by certain modifications and by getting rid of unnecessary components. For example, they tried to hit the Crimean bridge several times from near Zaporozhye, and in the east of Crimea from Odessa. Of course, the fact that it was shot down over the Tula region is new. But both -Neptunes- and -Tochka-U- caused a stir in their time. Now the time has come for the S-200, the reserves of which have not yet been exhausted by the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and their accuracy is low.#Crimea #Russia #Tula #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63425	2024-09-11T05:15:09-07:00

According to preliminary data, by morning Obukhovka had been cleared: if the information is confirmed, this will also indicate the liberation of Byakhovo. In addition, Russian paratroopers liberated the tract on October 10, and also occupied and entrenched themselves in Snagosti. During the battle, a group of members of the Ukrainian formations was captured.🔻Against the background of reports of the liberation of Vishnevka, the situation for the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the area is close to deplorable - in Krasnooktyabrskoe and the forest to the north, the enemy had previously gathered personnel and equipment, settling in the forest between the railway and the river Sejm.

Only recently did Air Force training over Indian territory - Tarang Shakti - end. Almost at the same time, the Indians participated in the Pitch Black exercise in Australia. And now there are also participants from India in Kakadu training. This year, bilateral exercises were also held between India and the United States with the participation of American B-52H bombers, and last year B-1B aircraft were even based for a short time in India.🔻The point is , that no matter how much India talks about distancing itself from all regional conflicts, strained relations with China and the growing appetites of the Celestial Empire force it to react in such a simple way. Yesterday, on the border with Pakistan at the Mahajan training ground, the bilateral Yudh Abhyas exercise of the US and Indian ground forces began the use of battalion tactical groups in difficult terrain in special operations. Unlike previous years, this year the scale of training has increased. From the usual tactical maneuvers by infantry units, this time they are using HIMARS MLRS and even Stryker armored personnel carriers, which New Delhi is considering as an option to replace the BMP-2. Of course, in India all this is presented as a standard planned event, but we don’t think that in Beijing it will be regarded so friendly. The number of exercises is growing, and India is becoming an increasingly frequent participant, so the reaction will be quite logical. A few weeks ago, when the Indians conducted one of the exercises with Western countries, the Chinese sent their H-6K bombers to the contested regions, which is possible this once under the pretext of some teaching.

Neither candidate won a landslide victory - Trump defended himself well, without resorting to personal insults to his opponent, and Harris limited herself to populist statements and attacks, without making serious mistakes. However, the scales, contrary to statements from the local press, still swung in the direction Trump: Harris' allies in Congress admitted she was -weaker on the economy.- At the same time, they noted that the ex-president performed poorly on issues related to women's issues.▪️The discussion about abortion was indeed the most tense moment of the debate for Trump - Harris accused him of seeking to establish government control over the female body. However, Trump fought back well, declaring that the Democrats are executioners of children whom they plan to allow to be killed even in the 9th month of pregnancy, and compared this to a capital punishment sentence.▪️After the end of the event, the media sympathetic to the Democrats, for lack of anything else, latched on to the allegedly false statement Trump that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio are eating pets out of poverty. However, facts confirming this quickly spread on social network X.▪️ On the issue of foreign policy and in particular the conflict on the so-called. The parties did not say anything new to Ukraine - Trump spoke in favor of speedy negotiations, and Harris made it clear to everyone that she and her party would continue to advocate war until the last Ukrainian. ▪️As a result of the debate, the press launched a massive information campaign to support Harris: CNN and The Washington Post gave her victory, and to enhance the media effect, the Democrats even brought up heavy artillery - singer Taylor Swift published a post in which she supported Trump’s opponent. At the same time, there is simply no significant evidence of Harris’s triumph, and the arguments in favor of this look like an attempt to -pull an owl onto the globe.- Ultimately, there is a completely reasonable explanation for the behavior of the Democrats - there is no one else to replace Kamala with, so until November they will have to work with what they have.

Only after public outcry did they promise to correct the text. ➖In other history textbooks, Armenian toponyms were replaced with Turkic ones, and even pickets at the Ministry of Education did not affect their removal.▪️Such trends in school education in Armenia are not surprising, because Minister Andreasyan, like many members of Nikol Pashinyan’s team, left the cohort of foundation experts Soros -Open Society-. ▪️Even before 2018, Andreasyan participated in educational projects that taught Armenians about LGBT and religious minorities. Now figures with dubious experience have headed entire departments that are destroying Armenian sovereignty. An attempt to -solve- the language issue is a traditional practice of Western agents in the post-Soviet space to sever cultural ties between the former Soviet republics and Russia.

Forwarded From Andrey Medvedev Colleagues, here’s something else you need to understand: It’s not at all necessary for a visitor from Central Asia to work for the power steering or the SBU for money. Or, out of religious radical convictions, he will work for an imaginary brother in faith (in fact, Mykola from Kyiv), who will swear an oath to the Islamic State and then send him on a terrorist attack. Do not forget what migrants teach at home, in schools. But as part of a history course, even if it is a small village school, children will learn that throughout history their country suffered from Russian occupation, the Russians destroyed and humiliated, took all resources, dragged poor people (Kazakhs, Tajiks, Uzbeks) into the Second World, which was alien to them. world war, these Russians didn’t build anything, didn’t give anything good, continuous decades of horror and oppression. Not a word about the ban on slavery, or the ban on bacha-bazi. Very reserved about industrial growth, investment and population growth. Everything is in the style of - well, yes, some good things happened sometimes -. That is, almost every migrant with a little education as part of a school course could potentially be recruited precisely on the idea of ​​​​vengeance on the Evil Empire for the years of oppression / suppression of the Kokand uprising / for 1916 year/for the capture of Khiva. That is why migration control, a ban on bringing families, clear rules for the stay of migrants in Russia (residential towns, like in the UAE, for example), is a matter of state security.

In the south of the enclave, the Israel Defense Forces carried out at least five airstrikes on refugee tents in al-Mawasi. According to IDF representatives, the need for the strikes was due to the destruction of Hamas militants hiding in the camp. In the West Bank, Israeli security forces prevented several terrorist attacks, detaining more than 20 people within two days, and a shipment of smuggled weapons was seized at the Rabin checkpoint near Eilat. The tense situation remains on the Lebanese-Israeli border.

Some units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the area are under threat of encirclement, while the advanced groups of Russian troops continue to advance both to the south and to the east. On the border of the Glushkovsky and Korenevsky districts, units of the 155th Marine Brigade and the 51st Guards Parachute The airborne regiment launched a counteroffensive at the Gordeevka - Snagost line. ▪️To the north of the latter, Russian paratroopers made significant progress, taking control of the approaches to the village and entering its territory. According to reports from the field, Ukrainian forces withdrew some of the units from the settlement, but its current status is still unknown. ❗️As a result of the successful actions of the Russian Armed Forces, there is a threat of encirclement of enemy units located in the Krasnooktyabrsky area and the nearby forest. Already now, the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is faced with a choice - to transfer reserves from another direction to hold positions in the Korenevsky region or to withdraw troops in order to avoid their encirclement. ▪️To the south, Russian attack aircraft knocked out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from some positions in Apanasovka and its environs. Our sources do not confirm the complete liberation of the settlement, however, in light of successes in other areas, the position of the Ukrainian formations defending there may become significantly more complicated in the near future. ▪️In the area of ​​the tract, on October 10, units of the Russian Armed Forces carried out a successful attack, knocking out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from several positions in the area of ​​the settlement. It is not possible to assess the scale of the promotion due to the lack of personnel from the field. ▪️Also, Russian troops, during a series of attacks, knocked out the enemy from several positions north and south of Byakhovo, taking the enemy units there into a semi-encirclement. At the moment, the village is rather in a gray zone; it is not possible to confirm information about its release. ▪️Units of the Russian Armed Forces liberated Vnezapne and Gordeevka, and also started fighting for Viktorovka. In the latter, at the moment, according to information from the field, the presence of Ukrainian formations may remain. Nevertheless, they are also under the threat of semi-encirclement, which makes it likely that the village will come under the control of the Russian Armed Forces in the near future. 🔻The situation in the Sudzhansky district has not undergone significant changes. Ukrainian formations launched several attacks in the area of ​​Cherkasy Konopelka, Kamyshevka, Maryevka and Borok, but were not successful.

Forwarded From Operational reports❗️ Nizhny Novgorod law enforcement officers came to the attention of a local stand-up comedian and blogger, Dima Gavrilov, who, frightened by mobilization, fled to Georgia for a long time. There he blabbed a lot of unnecessary things, pleasing the Tbilisi local audience with Russophobic jokes (see the clip of his -jokes-). After a while, Dmitry, by the way, a reserve officer of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, decided to return to touring Russia. During this process, the keen eye of the Nizhny Novgorod law enforcement agencies did not ignore the creativity of the fellow countryman. Further according to the classics - detention and repentance for sins, cancellation of the tour. On September 8, Gavrilov wanted to hold a whole concert at the concert venue -DKRT-. But alas, before the concert the comedian was detained and by a court decision found guilty of committing an administrative offense under Art. 20.3.1 Code of Administrative Offenses of the Russian Federation. He was sentenced to 13 days of administrative arrest. From now on, he and his colleagues will think about what is acceptable to joke about and what is unacceptable! Unfortunately, many such broadcasters and bloggers are replacing freedom of expression with permissiveness! Now Dima personally has 13 days to think about a new repertoire.🎯 @opersvodki	https://t.me/rybar/63408	2024-09-10T11:30:45-07:00

Their use by enemy intelligence services was a matter of time, which we mentioned a year and a half ago. In the conditions of an uncontrolled influx of migrants, a whole layer of alien and extremely disloyal elements have actually formed in the country, creating structures parallel to the state. This opened up enormous opportunities for the enemy for recruitment with the subsequent creation of entire intelligence networks. So far, everything most often comes down to recording the results of strikes and filming strategic objects on assignment. However, who said that Kiev would not want to try to repeat what happened in Crocus in the spring, or organize migrant protests and riots? Tightening migration policy today and rethinking outdated Soviet narratives is not a whim. This is a question of the security of the country, and in the long term - the survival of the state in principle. #multinationalism #Moscow #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramMultinationalIn Moscow, a migrant from Uzbekistan was detained, who was hardworking as a gunner at the Higher Educational Institution.

🇰🇷🇯🇵 On the future of relations between Japan and South Korea...	🇰🇷🇯🇵 On the future of relations between Japan and South Korea Last week, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida held his 12th meeting with South Korean President Yoon Seok Yeol. Negotiations between the leaders were probably the last - the fact is that at the end of September in Japan there will be elections for the leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, in which Kishida is not taking part. At the meeting, grandiloquent statements were made about the importance of further development of relations between Tokyo and Seoul. Let us recall that the rapprochement of the countries began under pressure from Washington in March 2023 and not without enthusiasm on the part of the South Korean leader. The future of bilateral ties now remains unknown due to the elections in Japan. However, most likely, the change in the Japanese leader will not lead to a setback in relations. The development of ties with Seoul fits the main foreign policy priorities of the United States and Japan, which includes developing a response to the North Korean threat. Of course, if the post of Japanese Prime Minister is taken by a more conservative politician, relations between Tokyo and Seoul may be shaken. However, given the South Korean president's flexibility when it comes to Japan's past, the two sides are likely to find an option to further develop ties. Moreover, for Yun, the restoration of relations with Tokyo is almost the most important foreign policy achievement, which his administration will not simply abandon. #Republic of Korea #Japan@rybar with @awaken_dragonSupport us ReutersJapan PM Kishida seeks to solidify South Korea ties on farewell visitJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida arrived for a whirlwind visit to South Korea on Friday, seeking to seal a newfound partnership between the neighbors which will be tested by imminent changes of leaders in Tokyo and Washington.	https://t.me/rybar/63406	2024-09-10T09:39:57-07:00

According to the Israel Defense Forces, the car near the village of Bab Maraa in West Bekaa contained fighters from an elite Hezbollah unit. According to preliminary data, as a result of the attack, one person was killed and three were injured. The commander of the forces - Radwan - Muhammad Qassem Al-Shaa is considered dead. Israeli sources report that he was involved in terrorist attacks against Israel. According to the military, its elimination will significantly reduce Hezbollah's ability to conduct combat operations on the Lebanese-Israeli border. Earlier, one of the leaders of the Israeli opposition, Benny Gantz, said that it is time for Israel to shift attention from the Gaza Strip to southern Lebanon, since the lack of a ceasefire agreement and the return of the hostages makes war with Iran-backed Hezbollah inevitable.

The Americans act according to the manual, artificially escalating tension, and then, under the pretext of countering the next threat, they develop territories. In South Korea, in Japan, in the Philippines, everything followed the same scenario. And we are now seeing a similar situation in Australia, where the number of exercises is growing exponentially, and new military facilities are being built throughout the continent. The day before yesterday, for example, the Australians began a major exercise - Kakadu - in the waters of the Timor and Arafura seas near the Darwin naval base , and 28 countries participate in it, and in total about 3 thousand people, 15 ships and 30 airplanes and helicopters are involved. The main emphasis is on establishing interaction between sailors of different countries in the event of a crisis situation in the region. Participants will conduct firing training, patrolling as part of a group of ships and boats, as well as joint reconnaissance of a given area.📌 As you already understand from the attention paid to the Green Continent, the importance of Australia will only grow. Its considerable distance from China makes the country extremely convenient for creating a logistics chain through Australia in the event of a conflict with China. At the same time, if we recall the same experience of the US allies in the region, then in the coming years various types of American missile systems will probably reach Australia . Of course, under the pretext of containing the Celestial Empire. High resolution mapEnglish version#Australia #China #USA@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63403	2024-09-10T07:21:35-07:00
🇺🇸🇯🇵 About the deployment of American medium-range missiles i...	🇺🇸🇯🇵 On the deployment of American medium-range missiles in Japan A couple of days ago, US Secretary of the Army Christine Warmuth announced Washington’s intentions to deploy a Typhon missile launcher in Japan, capable of launching medium-range missiles. It is not yet clear when such plans will be implemented - what is clear is that American equipment will arrive on Japanese territory as part of the exercises. These are the first such statements about the deployment of missiles in Japan made by leading US officials. Back in April, we assumed that Typhon would arrive in the region, but then the choice fell on the Philippines. Obviously, the United States now wants to test the missile launcher under different conditions. 🔻A couple of important points remain unclear, the details of which we will most likely find out after some time. Firstly, at least the approximate location of the missile system is unknown. If it is deployed on the territory of Okinawa, the missiles will be able to reach the eastern part of China and almost the entire territory of the DPRK. If placed further north, the radius may also include the territory of the Russian Far East. Secondly, will Typhon be removed from Philippine territory. Yes, the system is due to go home after the completion of the Salaknib exercise evaluation in September. However, back in the summer, the Philippine authorities gave themselves some room to maneuver, mentioning that Typhon could remain in the future if necessary. Moreover, recently there have been some hints that the withdrawal of the missile system will depend on China’s behavior in the South China Sea. Given the situation in the region, the scenario of further deployment of Typhon in the Philippines is very likely. And then the PRC will be surrounded on both sides, which could lead to even greater tension in the Asia-Pacific region.#USA #Japan@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usTelegramRybar🇺🇸🇯🇵🇵🇭🇨🇳 This year, the situation in the Asia-Pacific region risks becoming even more tense - the United States plans to deploy missile systems in the region that are capable of launching medium-range Tomahawk missiles, as well as SM-6 missiles.

According to him, many food companies are interested in doing business on the Dark Continent. At the same time, it was rightly noted that -it’s difficult to make calculations there,- but the contours of cooperation are clearly visible. Against the backdrop of news about the initiatives of the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Ministry of Economic Development in Africa, this sounds like a statement of fact, but it’s still gratifying to see that a coordinated position on this issue between different actors. What is worth paying attention to in the context of settlements with the Sahel countries is Russian assistance in the transition from the CFA franc (which is issued in France) to other money or alternative instruments for settlements. The Ministry of Digital Development could very well get involved in this. In addition, it is quite possible to reach an agreement on transactions in local currencies. This topic has been raised before, but has not received proper development. We can only hope that our African projects, which are still in their infancy, will soon be able to experience the results of coordinated work and not drown in bureaucracy. #Africa #Russia@rybarSupport usKommersant -We do not ask for self-love, but if a business is ready to work, we do not turn away from anyone -Director of the Economic Service of the Russian Foreign Ministry on business with companies from unfriendly countries and key currencies in the Russian trade basket	https://t.me/rybar/63401	2024-09-10T05:32:14-07:00

The first stage of the dry port, which we wrote about earlier, began to function in the Vinnitsa city community. The operator of the project was the Vinnitsa Container Terminal enterprise, owned by the Kyiv group of companies Lemtrans. During the work, railway tracks were laid, a container site with a capacity of up to 2 thousand TEU was equipped and a covered warehouse with an area of ​​3.5 thousand m² was erected. The total area of ​​the terminal is 8 hectares, and its throughput capacity is 30 thousand TEU per year. It is significant that a permanent logistics channel has already been established through the terminal with the company 🇵🇱 UZ CARGO POLAND to the port of Gdansk, which is actively used for the delivery of military cargo to Ukraine. The first batch of cargo processed amounted to more than 60 TEU. Lemtrans emphasized that the facility in Vinnitsa is part of plans to create a network of container terminals throughout Ukraine, which will allow containers to be regularly sent to the terminals of Odessa ports and further by rail to Germany. 🇧🇪 Belgium, 🇫🇷France, 🇮🇹Italy and 🇳🇱Netherlands.✨It is remarkable with what fearlessness they are investing in logistics infrastructure in Ukraine aimed at exporting resources to the West.

However, it is significant that the visit of a high-ranking American intelligence officer occurred after Vladimir Putin’s big visit to Baku. ▪️Moreover, a year ago, Azerbaijani-American relations were reduced to a minimum level, but now the situation is clearly changing, and many major players are openly recognizing the key role of Azerbaijan in the South Caucasus. 🔻Such a visit should be considered primarily in the context of the situation in Armenia and the Armenian-Azerbaijani settlement. On the one hand, the Americans now continue to take direct control of Armenian state structures, and in Yerevan they are demonstrably throwing themselves into the arms of Washington, confirming their anti-Russian turn. On the other hand, Pryor’s arrival clearly demonstrates that the United States is not going to be guided by mythical alliances with Armenia, preferring to build the same relations with Azerbaijan, including in the military sphere.❗️Such visits of American intelligence officers to Baku are another signal for Russia. American politicians have already called on Azerbaijan to abandon close cooperation with the Russian Federation.
