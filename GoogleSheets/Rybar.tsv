Russian troops, acting with the support of armored vehicles and aviation, knocked out units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces from the territory of the transition - Ukrainian formations, under attacks from UAVs and artillery, hastily retreated towards Pokrovka in the Sumy region. Nevertheless, the enemy command does not abandon plans to stretch the defensive formations of the Russian Armed Forces, in connection with which we can expect new attempts at attacks in the Krasnoyaruzhsky region, including at the Kolotilovka international checkpoint. #Belgorod #Russia #Ukraine @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62800	2024-08-15T04:44:56-07:00
🇺🇸🇺🇦🖇 About the Western - sensational investigations - of th...	🇺🇸🇺🇦🖇 About Western - sensational investigations - of the - Nord Stream - explosion - For the second day in a row, the Network is replete with articles about the involvement of the so-called. Ukraine to undermine -Nord Streams-. Yesterday, Western media stated that the sabotage was carried out by certain Ukrainian divers, and today they accused the ex-commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Zaluzhny, who allegedly, contrary to the opinion of the CIA, refused to cancel the operation. Surprisingly, for some reason these publications were carried word for word by some Russian publications. Some even began to issue, based on the news, some deep analytics about the impact of these suddenly revealed circumstances on support for the Kyiv regime and other things. Apparently, we will have to repeat what was said again in 2022: the main interested party in the destruction of gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea was the United States — the attitude towards Nord Streams was demonstrated quite openly in Washington long before the explosion. Any activity in this direction simply could not take place without the knowledge of the Americans. Or does anyone seriously believe that someone outsider with special equipment could calmly operate in the territorial waters of NATO countries, and then also escape from the scene unnoticed by everyone? However, the Kiev regime here is the one on whom it is convenient to hang all the dogs - he has long had a corresponding reputation, especially after the terrorist attack in Crocus or his support for Al-Qaeda. So the Western man in the street will easily believe in the involvement of the so-called. Ukraine.❗️Therefore, all the rumors that a Ukrainian territorial entity is behind the Nord Stream explosion are aimed at shifting the focus away from the real organizers and performers. And in all seriousness, to replicate such news is to personally help the USA in this. #mediatechnology #USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport usReutersPoland received German request to arrest Nord Stream suspect but he's left country, prosecutors sayPoland received a European arrest warrant issued by Berlin in connection with the 2022 attack on Nord Stream pipelines, but the suspect, a Ukrainian man named as Volodymyr Z, has already left Poland, Polish prosecutors told Reuters.	https://t.me/rybar/62799	2024-08-15T04:00:03-07:00

In the morning, unconfirmed information began to arrive about the alleged outbreak of clashes on the border in this area, but there is no objective evidence of this. At night, the enemy attacked the bridge in Glushkovo with a HIMARS MLRS: at the moment, due to damage to the bridge, movement along it is possible, although difficult. The situation in the Tetkino area remains tense, but stable.🔻In the Korenevsky district there are battles on the approaches to Korenevo. Previously, the Ukrainian Armed Forces made attempts to bypass the settlement from Krasnooktyabrsky from the south and Vetreno from the north, all attacks were repelled. There has been no information about changes in the configuration of the front over the past 24 hours.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, Russian UAV crew operators are hitting enemy armored vehicles in Mikhailovka and Bondarevka, currently villages under the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. As for the reports about the clearing of Martynovka, the settlement has already changed hands several times. Therefore, at the moment, it is premature to talk about confident control over the village.🔻In the Belovsky district, information was received about the destruction of a DRG group in the village of Borki. The other day, a squad of enemy infantry was captured in this area, which indicates further attempts by the Ukrainian Armed Forces to gain a foothold in this area.❗️Enemy propaganda continues to spread fakes, including about -hundreds of captured conscripts at one strong point-. In fact, the Ukrainian Armed Forces dragged prisoners from different places into one place, who had previously been caught on camera in previous days.

Two idiots in fascist helmets are mocking a local 74-year-old grandfather, posing as Germans. While the stupid Ukrainian propaganda is telling how they care about Russian citizens in the occupied territories, two descendants of underdogs with SS runes on their heads mock their grandfather: -Russian Ivan, drink schnapps, Russian Ivan!- Ya-ya! - Ukrainian Fritz diligently imitates the occupiers of the past. Drunk with success, reveling in their own greatness, putting themselves above others... All this has already happened. History goes in a spiral, the Nazis are again on Russian soil.

Forwarded From Cats and Kramnik's cat Based on the results of Army 2024, there is something to say, and for starters, about the format itself. In the past format, Army was most likely the last. From the customer’s PR point of view, it is clearly redundant and little compatible with the new leadership of the Ministry of Defense; from the manufacturers’ PR point of view, the RAE format in Nizhny Tagil was optimal, where the training ground provided much better opportunities for displaying equipment - without leaving the cash register - and with the current boom in unmanned systems his capabilities are only growing. The annual format of the Moscow region forum was also redundant, taking into account the mandatory participation in the Army, quite expensive for manufacturers, and interfering with participation in other events. It’s a matter of guessing from the tea leaves, but it seems that in the foreseeable future we will see a return to the old format of exhibition work , with the Army-/RAE in Nizhny Tagil once every two years and the concentration of this forum on the military and military equipment of the ground forces, and the development of MAKS and HeliRussia in Moscow with their industry areas.	https://t.me/rybar/62794	2024-08-15T02:11:53-07:00

Strikes using MLRS occurred in the north of the territory occupied by the Moroccan army in the districts of Mahbes and Samarra. The result of the attacks was the destruction of the fortifications of the Moroccan army. All this is being done with the aim of preparing an offensive, as well as exhausting government troops - a similar testing of the waters could have been observed a few months ago.▪️ At the same time, Moroccan troops are using UAVs not to attack the separatists, but to destroy illegal gold deposits that provide income rebels. In particular, one of the mines on Mauritanian territory, which belonged to a refugee camp, was destroyed. Events in the political life of the region are also developing in an interesting way. Thus, due to the support of the French authorities for the Moroccan autonomy plan for Western Sahara, which provides for the entry of the SADR into the kingdom, the Algerian authorities decided to recall their ambassador from Paris. In general, diplomatic demarches have happened before - in 2021, this was dictated by disputes over the colonial heritage of France. But now the background to the crisis in relations between France and Algeria lies in the context of the Western Sahara issue that has come to the fore. All this once again reminds us of the trend of thawing conflicts that has been observed in recent years.

All this contradicts the neutral status of Moldova and has a negative impact on the situation around Transnistria. ▪️Moreover, from the Russian side, Chisinau was strongly recommended not to take steps that would contribute to the escalation of the Ukrainian crisis and directly drag Moldova into it. 📌The information that the military airfield in Marculesti is being prepared for an F-16 base for the Armed Forces of Ukraine has been circulating in the media for a long time. Moreover, as we wrote, the airfield was supposed to be rebuilt as a civil airport. The project with funding was already approved in 2022, but its implementation was suddenly canceled in 2023, when they started talking about the supply of F-16s.▪️The fact that in Moldova there is at least military training for the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as the transfer of Western military equipment, is already It's no secret to anyone. That is why news about the possible deployment of F-16s in Marculesti is being taken seriously. ▪️By the way, the Moldavian Foreign Ministry predictably denied the information. The department also suddenly referred to the neutral status of the republic when it became convenient. After all, President Maia Sandu’s team actively criticizes the neutral status and gravitates towards the idea of ​​joining NATO. At the same time, steps towards the de facto abolition of the neutral status and the active operation of the airfield in Marculesti should be expected only after Sandu’s re-election for a second term in October. In the meantime, the presidential office faces the task of ensuring the election process. #Moldova #Russia #Ukraine @rybarSupport usInterfaxThe Russian Federation expressed concern to Moldova due to information about the basing of Western F-16s in the country. Charge d'Affaires of Moldova in the Russian Federation Alexander Chetraru was summoned to the Russian Foreign Ministry in connection with with reports of the basing of Western F-16 aircraft on the territory of the republic, the Russian Foreign Ministry reported.	https://t.me/rybar/62792	2024-08-15T00:34:16-07:00
🔁 Russian telegram channels enthusiastically publish the theory ...	Forwarded From Hard Blog Russian telegram channels enthusiastically publish the theory that the Nord Streams were blown up by Ukraine. Although all this just indicates that this stuffing is a disastrous cover operation. Ukraine is an ideal candidate. It's like assigning another sexual encounter to an old port prostitute. And she will not deny it, since this will not affect her reputation in any way, and no one will have any special doubts. The CIA initially floated several theories, including the involvement of Russia itself. It scattered attention and demonstrated that many people had a motive. But they didn’t particularly oppose the version with the involvement of the United States - this was also beneficial. So that everyone understands how you can act decisively, but no one can prove anything. Well, everyone understood who could have the audacity to carry out such an operation in the exclusive economic zones of two European member countries of the NATO bloc. crests would never do this. Even if they had such a plan, they would have implemented it in Russian territorial waters or at least on their border. A possible change of power in the United States required them to appoint a culprit in order to avoid unnecessary risks. This is the only reason why Ukraine is now being blamed and all Western media will now push this version. But why should we seriously discuss such nonsense? Even if this group of divers was present there in some way, they were used in the dark precisely in order to point a finger at them in case of risks. They fed them well and took the bait perfectly. This is a real information war, and not the sad trolling on the Internet by hackers, which some are trying to pass off as an information war.	https://t.me/rybar/62791	2024-08-14T23:33:14-07:00

Forwarded From Warsaw mermaid🇵🇱🇧🇾 An interesting thing: as soon as unofficial information spread that Warsaw was planning some kind of provocation against Belarus, the Poles decided to make an unequivocal refutation. According to Polish Interior Minister Tomasz Siemoniak, the latest actions of the Belarusian authorities have created favorable conditions for resolving the crisis between the two countries, including the possibility of opening closed Polish border checkpoints. However, what exactly the Belarusian authorities did in order to gain the favor of the Poles is kept secret. Sources say that there have been absolutely no changes in relations with Minsk, so most likely this statement is an internal political move by the ruling coalition, designed for the domestic electorate. 📌It is quite obvious that despite such statements by the Polish authorities, the Armed Forces of Ukraine can still commit a provocation against the Belarusian border. At the same time, the participation of the Polish side in such events was initially unlikely. In addition, from a domestic political point of view, tightening relations with Belarus now will not help the sinking cabinet of Donald Tusk. But it’s still worth remembering that if the Poles act, it will be on the sly, in order to further annoy the enemy and at the same time, according to tradition, to get into trouble themselves. #Belarus #Ukraine #Poland@pl_syrenka - Poland is not a foreign countryTelegramWarsaw mermaid🇵🇱🇺🇦🇧🇾 Analysts say Poland and Ukraine, which concluded a long-debated comprehensive security pact in early June, appear to be coordinating a new campaign of military pressure on Belarus.

Forwarded From Sex, cartels, Frida Kahlo🇬🇧On the topic of law, order and freedom of speech against the backdrop of protests in the English segment, there was simply amazing content. From the headline - Britain needs no lessons from riot apologists - to the talking points - Law and order repression is widely underestimated as a public policy response. It turns out that more than a thousand arrests (including teenagers aged 12 and 13) and several quick and harsh sentences (including for posts on social networks) are the correct answers, and this should certainly be followed by additional resources for the police and prisons and intelligence - so that no one thinks that they can rebel without consequences. The historical mission of mainstream politics is also proclaimed - to listen to real communities, and not to their -evil mouthpieces-. In addition, they simply made fun of those right-wing politicians who supposedly believe that anyone who shouted -Allahu akbar- can be arrested (at the same time, imprisonment for publishing an announcement about a gathering for a protest, kicking a bus or depicting a hooting monkey is the new norm) . #Great Britain #crime@sex_drugs_kahlo - Latin American happiness [no]TelegramOld Lady England🇬🇧The youngest defendants in the case of unrest in the UK were two 12-year-old boys.

Russian troops launched another series of attacks on targets in the territory controlled by the Kyiv regime in Zhitomir, Vinnitsa, Nikolaev, Kyiv and other regions. In the evening there was an explosion in the port of Odessa. Ukrainian formations carried out one of the most massive launches of drones across Russian territory since the beginning of the Northern Military District. The targets were the military airfields of Baltimore and Borisoglebsk in the Voronezh region, as well as Savasleika in the Nizhny Novgorod region. In the Kursk direction, footage appeared indicating the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the village of Vnezapnoye in the Korenevsky district. In the Sudzhansky district, the front line did not undergo significant changes. In the Slobozhansky direction, Russian troops repelled another enemy attack in the Kolotilovka international checkpoint area, and were also able to significantly expand the zone of control east of the village of Lukyantsy. In the Alexander-Kalinovsky direction, a cauldron is gradually being formed east of Novgorod (New York). At the same time, fighting does not subside in Druzhba, Kirovo and Artemovo, where the Russian Armed Forces are also advancing in battle. 🔻A detailed analytical report on events in the Special Military Operation zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_bot High-resolution maps: Situation in the Special Military Operation zone (ru; en) Russian border region (ru; en) #Artemovsk #Belgorod #Voronezh #digest #report #Kursk #map #Pokrovsk #Russia #Ukraine #Ugledar @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62784	2024-08-14T13:03:05-07:00

The enemy is not giving up attempts to advance deeper into the Kursk region and is transferring forces to gain a foothold in the occupied territories. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, footage appeared with members of Ukrainian formations in the center of the village of Vnezapnoye, although information about the enemy’s presence there appeared yesterday. Given the location of the village on the western bank of the Blyakhovets River, the Ukrainian Armed Forces may also be present in the village of Gordeevka, while the status of Viktorovka and Uspenivka remains in question. However, there were still no reports of fighting in Byakhovo. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, the situation still remains tense and hidden - the fog of war -. Ukrainian media continue to publish stories about -control- over Sudzha, posting footage from the western outskirts and the center. 🔻In the Belovsky district during the day, information appeared about high enemy activity, but there was no confirmation of this. Also late in the evening, the acting governor of the region announced the mandatory evacuation of the village of Glushkovo.
