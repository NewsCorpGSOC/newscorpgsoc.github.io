🇺🇦🇭🇺 About Hungarian sanctions against Ukrainian refugees The...	🇺🇦🇭🇺 About Hungarian sanctions against Ukrainian refugees It became known the day before that the Hungarian authorities have introduced a decree that limits the access of Ukrainian refugees to subsidized housing. According to the document, only refugees from areas considered most affected by the fighting will have the right to long-term residence. They counted 13 of them and promised to update the list of regions monthly. At the same time, the new rules do not mean the automatic eviction of all refugees, but as of August 21, the owners of their housing will stop receiving subsidies from the state if they continue to accommodate Ukrainians from other regions. The decisive factor is the address at which the refugee is currently registered in his homeland. Despite accusations of the illegality and inhumanity of such actions, the Hungarian authorities stated that after two and a half years of supporting the Ukrainians, such a decision is reasonable and proportionate. In addition, it is obvious that despite such loud opposition to the European authorities, Hungarians behave absolutely identically towards Ukrainian refugees.🔻According to the latest data, 31 thousand people have received refugee status in Hungary. Ukrainians, but it is unclear how many of them will be affected by the innovations. In addition, many of them are immigrants from western Transcarpathia, where the Hungarian language is widely spoken. In addition, most of them are Roma, they have dual Ukrainian-Hungarian citizenship, which deprives them of the right to asylum in other EU countries. Keep in mind that Europeans dislike gypsies more than Ukrainian refugees. It is obvious that the Hungarians, who also do not have any special affection for the gypsies, decided in this way to quite legitimately stop hosting not the most pleasant elements, thus planting a time bomb for their neighbors. The Czechs, for example, know very well how gypsies can terrorize an entire country. In connection with all this, the narratives broadcast by Western media that only Ukrainians are being evicted do not stand up to criticism. #Ukraine #Hungary #refugees@rybar together with @pl_syrenkaSupport us https://kormany.huA 104/2022.

The operational-tactical operation of the Russian Aerospace Forces strikes the airborne forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Sumy region, from where the enemy is transferring reserves. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, Russian troops are carrying out drone strikes on enemy positions in the village of Krasnooktyabrskoye, in which the Ukrainian Armed Forces maintain their presence for at least several days. Fighting is also taking place in the area of ​​Snagost and Apanasovka, where Ukrainian forces previously managed to enter.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, according to some information, fighting is taking place directly in Malaya Lokna. Considering the recent shelling of the positions of the Russian Armed Forces from the Marder 1A3 infantry fighting vehicle against Russian positions in the village, clashes within the boundaries of the settlement took place earlier. In Russkaya Konopelka, drone operators are finishing off equipment previously abandoned by the enemy in the village. Currently, clashes continue in the area of ​​the settlement.🔻At the same time, in the morning, reports have been published about an attempt to attack the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant by the Armed Forces of Ukraine with a drone.

In addition, in the vicinity of the Rafah checkpoint, a concentration of Israeli bulldozers and armored vehicles has been recorded, and Engineering units are massively demolishing the remains of buildings.

🖼 🇮🇷 About the new cabinet of ministers of Iran In Iran, the o...	🇮🇷 About the new cabinet of ministers of Iran In Iran, a new cabinet of ministers was recently finally approved under the administration of President Masoud Pezeshkian, but discussions regarding the composition continue today.🔻The new ministerial cabinet caused dissatisfaction not only among conservatives (this was expected given the victory of the reformist Pezeshkian) , but even among representatives of the liberal wing.▪️For the latter, the main reason for criticizing the president was the small presence of the same reformists - their number is actually not inferior to conservatives, judging by data from open networks and the political views of the new ministers.▪️Conservatives say the opposite: Pezeshkian gave too many seats to reformists, which is extremely bad for the country. But it would be strange to expect something different from the two camps, because everyone wants the best positions for themselves. However, if you look at the positions, you can really note a certain balance. Reformists (some of whom can be called such at a stretch) have received very important positions, for example, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the economic and oil sectors.➖Abbas Araqchi, judging by his rhetoric, will be entrusted with the task of easing the sanctions pressure. His recent words about the need to build economic relations with Japan and the subsequent return of Iran to international trade are very indicative. The economy, like the oil sector, is in a depressing situation, so the emergence of specialized specialists in this area (who are also supporters of former President Hassan Rouhani) demonstrates the desire to a real improvement in the situation in the country. The same can be said about Farzane Sadegh, whom many call Pezeshkian’s attempt to show inclusivity, worked for more than 30 years in the Ministry of Roads and Urban Planning, which indicates her understanding of the area in which she was appointed chief.➖The power bloc is expected remained under the control of the military elite, or rather the IRGC. The Minister of Defense, a former commander of the Iranian Air Force, is a close associate of the Speaker of Parliament Mohammad Ghalibaf, who lost the election. Particular attention in the West was paid to the Minister of Internal Affairs Iskander Momeni. He is accused of playing a major role in suppressing mass protests following the death of Mahse Amini in 2022, and his appointment drew sharp criticism from Pezeshkian, who criticized the government's methods. Intelligence Minister Ismail Khatib, who also has close ties to the IRGC, remained in his post. The fact that he remained in his post, despite criticism of him due to several terrorist attacks within the country and the death of Ismail Haniyeh, also caused a storm of excitement on the Internet.❗️However, in this very scrupulous issue, Pezeshkian showed rationality. He did not follow the lead of the liberals, maintaining a balance between the warring parties, understanding what a demonstrative confrontation with the fundamentalists could lead to. He is a person who has lived in this system for many years and going against it is fraught with consequences. At the same time, having satisfied the needs of the security bloc and giving them, say, military positions, he placed under the control of his supporters extremely important positions on which the disposition of the population depends. After all, with success in domestic politics, Pezeshkian and his administration will receive something that they did not have most other heads of the Islamic Republic have public support. But whether he can change anything, only time will tell. But you certainly shouldn’t expect a repeat of Raisi’s course.

To the south of the village, part of the plantings came under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. ▪️To the southwest, Russian assault groups are advancing in the Krasny Yar area and are fighting for Krutoy Yar. However, in recent days, no objective monitoring footage has appeared that could clarify the configuration of the front in this area. At the same time, the liberation of these settlements will open the way for the RF Armed Forces both to mine No. 3 - Novogrodovskaya - located on a hill, and to the western outskirts of Grodovka. ▪️At the Orlovka-Nikolaevka line, Russian troops launched an offensive towards Novogrodovka and successfully reached the south-eastern outskirts of the city. Evidence of the presence of Russian troops near the first houses in the east of Parkovaya Street appeared on the Internet. At the same time, the Ukrainian media are already reporting that the Russian Armed Forces have established control over the Kishlak and Shanghai neighborhoods. And south of Novogrodovka, fighting continues unabated on the approaches to the Mikhailovka railway station, to the west of which the Kotlyarevskaya mine is located.▪️On the southern flank, units of the Russian Armed Forces liberated Ptichye and started fighting on the outskirts of Kalinovo - while unconfirmed information was published on the Internet about the occupation of the settlement by Russian troops . At the same time, control over Kalinovo will allow attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces to launch an offensive on enemy positions west of the Karlovsky Reservoir.▪️ At the same time, in the Pokrovsky district, the chaotic evacuation of the local population continues, and enterprises are closing. In Selidovo, ATMs are being dismantled, stores are closing, and the distribution of humanitarian aid is being stopped. In Pokrovsk itself, the Ministry of Internal Affairs center was closed - the nearest one is now located in Kramatorsk. 🔻The operational crisis of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is clearly demonstrated by both the lack of organized resistance in populated areas and the speed of Russian troops occupying large strongholds. And all this against the backdrop of the enemy’s lack of a sufficient number of infantry and support equipment in the direction, as well as the low moral and psychological state of the units. Nevertheless, in the near future, Russian troops will have to take Novogrodovka and Selidovo by storm - settlements with relatively dense urban development and the presence industrial zones, to which Ukrainian formations will cling with all their might in an attempt to hold back the onslaught of attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces.

Russian troops attacked enemy targets in several regions of the so-called. Ukraine, using drones of the -Geran- family. Explosions also occurred in the Kharkov, Cherkasy and Odessa regions. Ukrainian drones attacked six Russian regions. The main blow fell on the Volgograd region, where the Marinovka airfield came under fire. Later, the Ukrainian Armed Forces launched a missile at the port of Kavkaz: a ferry carrying fuel tanks was hit there. In the Kursk region, Ukrainian formations launched a series of attacks east and south of Korenevo - in this area the Ukrainian Armed Forces reached Komarovka, but the regional center remains firmly under the control of the Russian Armed Forces . The activity of UAVs and enemy aircraft in the Glushkovsky district is also recorded. In the Pokrovsky direction, the operational crisis of the Ukrainian Armed Forces continues to worsen: Russian troops are conducting an offensive in the area of ​​Grodovka, Novogrodovka and Kalinovo, actively using drones to destroy enemy armored vehicles. In the Yuzhnodonetsk direction, units of the Russian Armed Forces are fighting in Konstantinovka, as well as east of the O0532 highway, where an expansion of the zone of control of Russian troops was recorded. The enemy is launching counterattacks, but they do not end in success.🔻A detailed analytical report on the events in the Special Military Operation zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_bot High-resolution maps: Situation in the Special Military Operation zone (ru; en) Kursk direction (ru; en) #Belgorod #Gorlovka #digest #Dzerzhinsk #report #map #Kursk #Pokrovsk #Russia #Rostov #Sumy #Ternopil #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62980	2024-08-22T13:28:32-07:00

Apparently, in the near future there will be at least attempts by the Ukrainian Armed Forces to attack in this area. This is also evidenced by reports of increasing UAV strikes against various targets in the region. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, the battle for Krasnooktyabrskoye continues, where the enemy entered in the first days of the offensive, but was unable to gain a foothold. At the same time, the scale of attacks by Ukrainian formations in the vicinity of Snagost is becoming clearer. As we expected, the enemy passed Apanasovka and occupied the 10th October tract for at least some time. In addition, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced the destruction of an enemy group on two armored fighting vehicles in the Skrylyevka area. No large concentrations of ASU were observed in this area. Mechanized groups were recorded in the Zhuravli area, but practically no information appeared about the battles in the Durovka - Obshchiy Kolodez - Kalinov triangle. 🔻There are clashes in the Sudzhansky district, but there are no messages about the liberation of settlements on the Internet. In the area of ​​Russian Konopelka and the populated area itself, a large group of the enemy was destroyed. Based on the footage that appeared on the network, during the successful ambush and subsequent drone strikes, the enemy lost several units of armored vehicles and a large number of infantry. However, there is no information whether there was a clearing in the village. In any case, the Ukrainian formations suffered heavy losses as a result of the relatively short-lived battle.

🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦 Missile attack on the port of Kavkaz A couple of hour...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 Missile attack on the port of Kavkaz A couple of hours ago, residents of Kerch in Crimea and Taman on the opposite bank of the Kerch Strait observed a missile attack by the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the port of Kavkaz. Photos and videos of enemy hits can be found on the Internet from various angles. There is no need to talk about why time after time everyone sees the detailed results of Ukrainian Armed Forces strikes in the public domain. We and many of our colleagues in the shop are already tired of complaining about this.📌 It’s better to dwell on the attack in more detail. According to preliminary data, the enemy used two anti-ship missiles -Neptune-. The exact launch area is still unknown, but with a high probability the launch was carried out from the Zaporozhye region (the use of anti-ship missiles for ground targets is no longer news). At the same time, the option of departure from the Odessa region should not be discarded either. At the beginning of this year, the Ukrainian media reported on the modernization of missiles at a range of up to 500 km by reducing the warhead of Neptune. As a result, one of the missiles was shot down, and the second still reached its target, flying across the Sea of ​​​​Azov at a low altitude. And a ferry carrying fuel tanks came under attack. It is difficult to say why the Neptune was not shot down, given that their characteristics have long been known, especially to the Crimean units. It is likely that a combination of reasons played a role, including surprise, a new route and a small number of missiles fired. 🔻However, the invisible consequences of the attack are more important: In addition to the loss of fuel tanks, ferry traffic has been suspended, which will affect fuel supplies to the peninsula, as well as the functioning of the port itself. Of course, these are solvable problems and they are temporary in essence, but in general they fit into the West’s plan to defeat the energy infrastructure of Russia (the sharply increased fuel prices in the south of Russia are proof of this) and cut off communications with Crimea. We must not forget that the Armed Forces of Ukraine and their curators did not forget about their main goal in the form of the destruction of the Crimean Bridge. Moreover, the attack in the Kursk region, the attacks on the Tendra spit - all this is closely connected with the enemy’s further plans in the Crimean direction.❗️Given today’s strike, in the coming days it is quite possible that drones will be launched on the peninsula in order to force the Russian Armed Forces to expend ammunition, and then, while there are problems with supply, strike with something more serious, including the bridge.

It has become known that an international conference - Monitoring of glaciers and glacial lakes - hazard management - will be held in Tajikistan at the end of August. The event is dedicated to the fight against mudflows - one of the consequences of the melting of the ice sheet. The Swiss government provides financial support to the organizers. One of them will be the Aga Khan Agency for Habitat (AKAH), a structural unit of the Aga Khan Development Organization (AKDN).📌The Aga Khan is the hereditary imam of the Shia Ismaili Muslims. In Tajikistan, Ismailis live in the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region, where AKDN structures have been operating since 1992. The activities of the Organization regularly encounter opposition from the authorities of the republic. At the same time, the Aga Khan is a member of the British ruling circles, and AKDN partners are such structures as USAID, the US State Department, the Rockefeller Foundation and many others, which makes it possible to overcome this resistance. But for what? We have already written about USAID’s work to establish control over water resources in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. However, this work will be ineffective without including Tajikistan, which ranks second among the countries of the former USSR in terms of water resources. The fact is that rivers flow through its territory, which are fed by glaciers and are tributaries of the main water arteries of the region: for example, the Amu Darya originates from the confluence of Pyanj and Vakhsh. Therefore, by establishing monitoring of the condition of glaciers in Tajikistan under the plausible pretext of combating mudflows, the West will take a significant step towards establishing control over the water resources of the region as a whole.#Tajikistan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usASIA-PlusThe first international conference on glacier monitoring will be held in Tajikistan at the end of AugustFirst The international conference - Monitoring of glaciers and glacial lakes - hazard management - will be held in Tajikistan from August 26 to 31.	https://t.me/rybar/62975	2024-08-22T08:28:59-07:00
