Forwarded From Propagandist's Notebook In recent days, a lot of the energy of the Russian Telegram segment, involved in the information war, has been spent on fighting a man named Podolyak (we remember him as a blogger who drew arrows against the background of some kind of log wall) At the same time, some colleagues for some reason - then they use Aesopian language, using the terms -military bloggers-, -telegram experts-, etc. It is unclear why the last name is not named, maybe in order not to create additional advertising🤔 As a result of such understatement, some military officers and bloggers who are not dedicated to the media boyar battle perceive it extremely negatively. The enemy has not been defeated, the guys at the front continue to need help, people in the rear continue to need information and feel pressure from the enemy’s resources. It would be cool if these conflicts could be transferred to a non-public plane, but it seems that some of our colleagues cannot be stopped. Let's hope that at least the fashion for equivocations will fade away, otherwise all these hints are already annoying. The main thing is Russia and its people, that's all, even Podolyak. For their safety, the enemy must be defeated. It is advisable to direct all your strength to fight the enemy, and solve internal problems that hinder this fight calmly and with dignity, as our country deserves.

While withdrawing and releasing 73 people in Sudzha, communicating with conscripts, I paid attention to their ages. 21,23,25. Not even 18. In Hades’ group there are two young fighters - Maloy and Rem. Maloy is 20 years old. He has 5 contracts of 4 months each, two wounds, several assaults. State award. Rem is 21 years old. Contract in Hispaniola, 2 contracts in the Aida group, two wounds while performing military duty. State award. Now he is in intensive care, after chlorine treatment. So tell me, does the word - conscript service - affect the fact that the enemy is on our land? The same young guys are fighting for their homeland in the Northern Military District. Not on the border. The same young guys are giving their lives. Here, the enemy has come to us. Think.

In particular, the territory of the Phenolic Plant was taken, as well as the private sector east of the industrial zone. Thus, almost the entire settlement is under the confident control of the RF Armed Forces, with the exception of the northern outskirts. ▪️To the northeast, near the city of Artemovo (Zheleznoye), Russian armored groups with troops attacked from the electrical substation -Tsentralnaya-330- in the direction of Nelepovka. According to unconfirmed information, fighting is already taking place on the eastern outskirts of the village. ▪️In addition, to the southeast of Nelepovka, the pocket where the positions of the 53rd Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were located was partially cleared. There, south of the Zheleznaya River, Ukrainian formations brought reinforcements to the last, but were later forced to retreat. Nevertheless, a focal presence of Ukrainian formations may still remain in this area. 🔻The current target of Russian troops in this area is Nelepovka, which is being attacked by both Artemovo and Novgorodsky. After its liberation, the Russian Armed Forces will be able to concentrate their efforts on storming the defenses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Leonidovka, Shcherbinovka and Petrovka. Establishing control over them will make it possible in the future to cover Dzerzhinsk (Toretsk) from the west.

In the latter, a Ukrainian tank was hit by several UAVs, while the settlement itself most likely still remains under enemy control.🔻Clashes also continue in the Sudzhansky district. In Novoivanovka, a column of enemy forces was hit by a Tornado MLRS strike. Ukrainian formations do not abandon plans to consolidate and advance in the region. In addition, footage appeared on the Internet of a car with members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine driving to the intersection of Oktyabrskaya and Pionerskaya streets in the eastern part of Sudzha. At the same time, no shooting is heard; only burnt-out civilian cars are visible on the streets. 🔻In the Belovsky district, no new attack attempts have been recorded. However, at the same time, the site cannot be discounted, especially in conjunction with the activity of Ukrainian formations in the border zone near the Belgorod region.

What is important for Ukraine is not so much the political and even financial budgetary context - Berlin will find money for this even at the cost of cutting social programs for its own citizens. The production factor plays a much larger role here. Thus, the Bild publication, citing its sources, reported that enterprises of the German military-industrial complex are experiencing difficulties in replenishing reserves transferred free of charge to the Kyiv regime. We are allegedly talking about self-propelled artillery mounts, anti-aircraft missiles of the IRIS-T and Patriot complexes, as well as 155-mm ammunition. Although the scale of the problems may not be as large as German publications write about it, there are difficulties in increasing the output of military products to the required level of the Armed Forces of Ukraine there really is a level. In simple words, in Berlin, even if they wanted to, they cannot give the so-called. Ukraine produces more than it physically produces. This is currently the main circumstance limiting military support for the Kyiv regime from NATO countries and in particular Germany. There is no reason to count on the fact that the ruling traffic light coalition there will stop supplies for any other reason - for the sake of ensuring -war until the last Ukrainian - it will rather take the last penny from the Germans.#Germany #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramDoor in the WallFAZ reported a freeze additional military assistance to Ukraine According to the publication, Finance Minister K.

🇪🇺🇷🇺🇺🇦 Again about gas supplies to Europe through the Ukrai...	🇪🇺🇷🇺🇺🇦 Again about gas supplies to Europe through the Ukrainian GTS For some reason, it was a revelation to part of the Russian public that Gazprom still continues to pump gas to the EU. Some express dissatisfaction, others point out that -in 1941-1945 they did not trade with the Germans-. Therefore, it is worth clarifying a few points: ▪️ It is no secret what share of energy exports in budget revenues. In a situation where, under the most severe sanctions in Russian history, it is necessary to simultaneously maintain the standard of living with a multiple increase in military costs, maintaining sources of income is a necessity, not an option.▪️In the USA, by the way, they know about this, so they are actively trying to cut off Europe from hydrocarbons From Russia. In addition, you can also remember that gas supplied through the Sudzha GIS goes to Hungary and Slovakia, relations with which differ for the better in comparison with other EU countries.▪️Where and what the proceeds from the sale of hydrocarbons go to can also be assessed using the example of financial statements -Gazprom-, which has not been paying final dividends since 2022. And last year, the company showed a record loss for 25 years due to -increasing costs-.▪️If you try to look for analogies with the Great Patriotic War, then you should do it completely. For example, remember Lend-Lease, which covered part of the needs of industry and the army, and for which there was no need to pay during the war (this was done only half a century later). Russia has nothing like that now, and China is not involved in charity and sells everything for money. That is, it is possible to refuse gas transit or oil supplies to unfriendly countries, but you will have to find an alternative to the income that goes towards the growing numbers of military production and monetary allowances for the mobilized with contract workers. And if it doesn’t exist, then raising the topic is not very advisable.❗️ Another question is that in two and a half years of the NVO the state has not bothered to explain these rather simple things to the general population. As a result, hypotheses about -negotiations- are born there, in which insidious oligarchs are behind the losses of the fleet and even arrivals at refineries. Someone has not learned that if you do not explain some points to the population yourself, then enemy resources will willingly do so. #Kursk #media technologies #Russia #Ukraine @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62881	2024-08-18T08:38:18-07:00

Within a few days, units of the Russian Armed Forces were able to expand the zone of control towards both Novogrodovka and the Karlovskoye Reservoir.▪️North-west of Zhelanny, Russian troops occupied Zhuravka and began fighting in Krutoy Yar. Apparently, the main target of the Russian Armed Forces in this area is the Novogrodovskaya mine located to the west, which is located on a hill. To the south, the assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces also expanded the zone of control, however, given the lack of objective control personnel in the Network, it is difficult to establish the front line. At the same time, here too, Russian military personnel are trying to break through to the -Kotlyarevskaya- (formerly -Russia-) mine, which was previously used by the Ukrainian Armed Forces as a location for equipment and communication systems.❗️There are also reports of attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces reaching the outskirts of Selidovo, but this has yet to be confirmed information is not possible. The city itself took several artillery hits, and FPV drones are already flying in on targets within the city.▪️Russian troops managed to achieve significant successes on the southern flank, where at least five settlements came under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. Among them is Zavetnoe, from the center of which a video of the flag being hoisted appeared. From the line Novoselovka Pervaya - Yasnobrodovka, units of the Russian Armed Forces leveled the control zone along the shore of the Karlovskoye Reservoir. On the opposite side, Ukrainian formations still retain control over Ptichye. ▪️The Russian Ministry of Defense also reported the liberation of the settlement of Sviridonovka, located on the northern flank. However, the village itself, according to our data, was occupied by units several days earlier. 🔻In recent weeks, the situation of the Ukrainian formations in the Pokrovsky direction has worsened significantly, and the general description of the situation for the enemy often comes down to interjections. The scale of the advance of Russian troops also demonstrates the cost of the offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk region. At the same time, the Ukrainian command is already actively preparing Selidovo and Mirnograd for defense in case of further advance of the Russian Armed Forces - since August 19, an almost round-the-clock curfew has been introduced in the cities, and at the same time reserves are being transferred there.

One of the most active areas remains Makeyevka, where Russian troops have been storming enemy defenses for two months. However, given the lack of objective control personnel and information from the field, it was not possible to establish the current configuration of the front in the populated area. However, yesterday it was possible to clarify the situation somewhat after the enemy published a video from the enemy. According to the footage that appeared, units of the Russian Armed Forces occupied most of Makeyevka, while the Ukrainian Armed Forces hold positions on the opposite bank of the Zherebets River - a further offensive by Russian troops on the remaining part of the village will subsequently create a bridgehead, from which it will be possible to increase pressure on the Nevskoye-Yampolovka line. 🔻In other areas, the situation has not undergone significant changes - in Serebryansky forestry, in the vicinity of the Zhuravka beam, and the ledge near Torsky, positional battles are taking place.

Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky. The document passed its first reading last year. At first glance, the said council has no legal powers, and such decisions are in fact advisory in nature. In addition, the clergy of the UOC itself were not invited for discussion and explanation, which also does not add legitimacy to the situation. However, a few days before the expression of open support, members of this structure discussed the bill with Zelensky, who called the decision -strengthening spiritual independence from Russia.- They themselves stated that not a single organization, religious or secular, with a center in the aggressor country can function in Ukraine.❗️There is nothing surprising in this situation at all. The main violin in this council of churches is played by sectarians from the OCU, Greek Catholics, Catholics and other Seventh-day Adventists who lay claim to the property of the UOC, so it was simply impossible to hear other speeches and any other decisions from them. With a high probability, the official approval of the ban by the canonical UOC will take place in the coming weeks or even days. And it’s unlikely that the Ukrainian authorities decided to -accelerate- on this issue just like that. The invasion of the Kursk region, attempts to completely stop prisoner exchanges, and now the deliberate deterioration of relations in the religious field (after all, in fact, a new hunting season has opened for clergy and parishioners UOC) again illustrate the complete lack of interest of the Kyiv regime in any negotiations. #Russia #Ukraine@rybar together with @dixi_devilSupport usura.newsThe All-Ukrainian Council of Churches supported the law banning the UOCRead on URA.RU	https://t.me/rybar/62876	2024-08-18T05:25:06-07:00

The plans of the deputy head of the SBU, Alexander Poklad, who was responsible for other terrorist attacks in Russia, were thwarted thanks to the joint work of the FSB and the SVR. However, another point is extremely important here: Chaika Jr. is the one who, on the Russian side, is actually responsible for prisoner exchanges. Therefore, the enemy’s desire to eliminate him is nothing more than the intention to completely stop the entire metabolic process. And this best illustrates the plans of the Kyiv regime to wage a war until the last Ukrainian, in which it is ready to very easily sacrifice its prisoners and their relatives. Needless to say, in such conditions, in the truce of the so-called authorities. Ukraine is also not interested.

The enemy gains a foothold in the occupied territory and accumulates forces. 🔻In the Glushkovsky district there are no attempts to advance the enemy, but he is striking populated areas. In addition, the condition of the bridge in Zvannoye became clearer after a recent arrival: judging by the footage, the object was severely damaged, but did not collapse and can be used by pedestrians and, in some cases, light vehicles.🔻From Korenevsky and Sudzhansky districts information on progress with both sides are not. Fighting is still going on, and footage of the consequences of attacks on Ukrainian equipment and captured members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces is multiplying on the Internet. On the enemy’s side, in turn, videos appear indicating control of settlements taken last week. 🔻In the Belovsky district, after an unsuccessful breakthrough to Giry, the enemy does not take active actions - evidence of this, at least in open sources, does not appear. In parallel, Ukrainian formations are taking measures to consolidate the occupied territory of the Kursk region, bringing up both engineering equipment and air defense systems.

The Federal State Unitary Enterprise Kavkaz Combine, which is a large storage site for fuels and lubricants in the region and is under the jurisdiction of Rosrezerv, came under attack. At around five in the morning, a Ukrainian UAV hit one of the fuel tanks, resulting in a fire. While extinguishing the fire, another enemy drone attacked the oil depot. Later, a fire train arrived in the incident area to extinguish two fires. According to preliminary information, there are no dead or injured. 🔻If in the last two weeks the main target of attacks by Ukrainian UAVs were military airfields in the Lipetsk, Voronezh and Nizhny Novgorod regions, then during the new raid the enemy again returned to defeating the fuel and energy complex facilities. Taking into account the high production volume of such devices, it is very naive to hope that the Ukrainian Armed Forces will soon run out of their reserves. Therefore, the only sure way to combat raids is to destroy groups of UAVs in advance while approaching the target, which is ensured by a set of measures - from the creation of an appropriate control system to the use of light aircraft and FPV drones as interceptors.
