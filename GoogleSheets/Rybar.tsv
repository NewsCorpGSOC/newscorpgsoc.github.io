🇪🇺🇷🇺🇺🇦 Again about gas supplies to Europe through the Ukrai...	🇪🇺🇷🇺🇺🇦 Again about gas supplies to Europe through the Ukrainian GTS For some reason, it was a revelation to part of the Russian public that Gazprom still continues to pump gas to the EU. Some express dissatisfaction, others point out that -in 1941-1945 they did not trade with the Germans-. Therefore, it is worth clarifying a few points: ▪️ It is no secret what share of energy exports in budget revenues. In a situation where, under the most severe sanctions in Russian history, it is necessary to simultaneously maintain the standard of living with a multiple increase in military costs, maintaining sources of income is a necessity, not an option.▪️In the USA, by the way, they know about this, so they are actively trying to cut off Europe from hydrocarbons From Russia. In addition, you can also remember that gas supplied through the Sudzha GIS goes to Hungary and Slovakia, relations with which differ for the better in comparison with other EU countries.▪️Where and what the proceeds from the sale of hydrocarbons go to can also be assessed using the example of financial statements -Gazprom-, which has not been paying final dividends since 2022. And last year, the company showed a record loss for 25 years due to -increasing costs-.▪️If you try to look for analogies with the Great Patriotic War, then you should do it completely. For example, remember Lend-Lease, which covered part of the needs of industry and the army, and for which there was no need to pay during the war (this was done only half a century later). Russia has nothing like that now, and China is not involved in charity and sells everything for money. That is, it is possible to refuse gas transit or oil supplies to unfriendly countries, but you will have to find an alternative to the income that goes towards the growing numbers of military production and monetary allowances for the mobilized with contract workers. And if it doesn’t exist, then raising the topic is not very advisable.❗️ Another question is that in two and a half years of the NVO the state has not bothered to explain these rather simple things to the general population. As a result, hypotheses about -negotiations- are born there, in which insidious oligarchs are behind the losses of the fleet and even arrivals at refineries. Someone has not learned that if you do not explain some points to the population yourself, then enemy resources will willingly do so. #Kursk #media technologies #Russia #Ukraine @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62881	2024-08-18T08:38:18-07:00

Within a few days, units of the Russian Armed Forces were able to expand the zone of control towards both Novogrodovka and the Karlovskoye Reservoir.▪️North-west of Zhelanny, Russian troops occupied Zhuravka and began fighting in Krutoy Yar. Apparently, the main target of the Russian Armed Forces in this area is the Novogrodovskaya mine located to the west, which is located on a hill. To the south, the assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces also expanded the zone of control, however, given the lack of objective control personnel in the Network, it is difficult to establish the front line. At the same time, here too, Russian military personnel are trying to break through to the -Kotlyarevskaya- (formerly -Russia-) mine, which was previously used by the Ukrainian Armed Forces as a location for equipment and communication systems.❗️There are also reports of attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces reaching the outskirts of Selidovo, but this has yet to be confirmed information is not possible. The city itself took several artillery hits, and FPV drones are already flying in on targets within the city.▪️Russian troops managed to achieve significant successes on the southern flank, where at least five settlements came under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. Among them is Zavetnoe, from the center of which a video of the flag being hoisted appeared. From the line Novoselovka Pervaya - Yasnobrodovka, units of the Russian Armed Forces leveled the control zone along the shore of the Karlovskoye Reservoir. On the opposite side, Ukrainian formations still retain control over Ptichye. ▪️The Russian Ministry of Defense also reported the liberation of the settlement of Sviridonovka, located on the northern flank. However, the village itself, according to our data, was occupied by units several days earlier. 🔻In recent weeks, the situation of the Ukrainian formations in the Pokrovsky direction has worsened significantly, and the general description of the situation for the enemy often comes down to interjections. The scale of the advance of Russian troops also demonstrates the cost of the offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk region. At the same time, the Ukrainian command is already actively preparing Selidovo and Mirnograd for defense in case of further advance of the Russian Armed Forces - since August 19, an almost round-the-clock curfew has been introduced in the cities, and at the same time reserves are being transferred there.

One of the most active areas remains Makeyevka, where Russian troops have been storming enemy defenses for two months. However, given the lack of objective control personnel and information from the field, it was not possible to establish the current configuration of the front in the populated area. However, yesterday it was possible to clarify the situation somewhat after the enemy published a video from the enemy. According to the footage that appeared, units of the Russian Armed Forces occupied most of Makeyevka, while the Ukrainian Armed Forces hold positions on the opposite bank of the Zherebets River - a further offensive by Russian troops on the remaining part of the village will subsequently create a bridgehead, from which it will be possible to increase pressure on the Nevskoye-Yampolovka line. 🔻In other areas, the situation has not undergone significant changes - in Serebryansky forestry, in the vicinity of the Zhuravka beam, and the ledge near Torsky, positional battles are taking place. Russian troops periodically strike both enemy artillery and mobile electronic warfare systems.

Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky. The document passed its first reading last year. At first glance, the said council has no legal powers, and such decisions are in fact advisory in nature. In addition, the clergy of the UOC itself were not invited for discussion and explanation, which also does not add legitimacy to the situation. However, a few days before the expression of open support, members of this structure discussed the bill with Zelensky, who called the decision -strengthening spiritual independence from Russia.- They themselves stated that not a single organization, religious or secular, with a center in the aggressor country can function in Ukraine.❗️There is nothing surprising in this situation at all. The main violin in this council of churches is played by sectarians from the OCU, Greek Catholics, Catholics and other Seventh-day Adventists who lay claim to the property of the UOC, so it was simply impossible to hear other speeches and any other decisions from them. With a high probability, the official approval of the ban by the canonical UOC will take place in the coming weeks or even days. And it’s unlikely that the Ukrainian authorities decided to -accelerate- on this issue just like that. The invasion of the Kursk region, attempts to completely stop prisoner exchanges, and now the deliberate deterioration of relations in the religious field (after all, in fact, a new hunting season has opened for clergy and parishioners UOC) again illustrate the complete lack of interest of the Kyiv regime in any negotiations. #Russia #Ukraine@rybar together with @dixi_devilSupport usura.newsThe All-Ukrainian Council of Churches supported the law banning the UOCRead on URA.RU	https://t.me/rybar/62876	2024-08-18T05:25:06-07:00

The plans of the deputy head of the SBU, Alexander Poklad, who was responsible for other terrorist attacks in Russia, were thwarted thanks to the joint work of the FSB and the SVR. However, another point is extremely important here: Chaika Jr. is the one who, on the Russian side, is actually responsible for prisoner exchanges. Therefore, the enemy’s desire to eliminate him is nothing more than the intention to completely stop the entire metabolic process. And this best illustrates the plans of the Kyiv regime to wage a war until the last Ukrainian, in which it is ready to very easily sacrifice its prisoners and their relatives. Needless to say, in such conditions, in the truce of the so-called authorities. Ukraine is also not interested. And in general, against the backdrop of all this, I would like to once again say hello to the naive Cheburashkas living in a parallel reality, who still sincerely hope for some kind of negotiations with the West. #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramChildren of ArbatBeing the main ideologist of the continuation war, the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Ermak set the task of intensifying sabotage work on Russian territory: at the suggestion of the head of the SBU Vasily Malyuk, the son of the former prosecutor general was chosen as a new target...	https://t.me/rybar/62875	2024-08-18T04:22:06-07:00

The enemy gains a foothold in the occupied territory and accumulates forces. 🔻In the Glushkovsky district there are no attempts to advance the enemy, but he is striking populated areas. In addition, the condition of the bridge in Zvannoye became clearer after a recent arrival: judging by the footage, the object was severely damaged, but did not collapse and can be used by pedestrians and, in some cases, light vehicles.🔻From Korenevsky and Sudzhansky districts information on progress with both sides are not. Fighting is still going on, and footage of the consequences of attacks on Ukrainian equipment and captured members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces is multiplying on the Internet. On the enemy’s side, in turn, videos appear indicating control of settlements taken last week. 🔻In the Belovsky district, after an unsuccessful breakthrough to Giry, the enemy does not take active actions - evidence of this, at least in open sources, does not appear. In parallel, Ukrainian formations are taking measures to consolidate the occupied territory of the Kursk region, bringing up both engineering equipment and air defense systems.

At night, Ukrainian drones hit an oil depot near Proletarsk, southeast of Rostov-on-Don. The Federal State Unitary Enterprise Kavkaz Combine, which is a large storage site for fuels and lubricants in the region and is under the jurisdiction of Rosrezerv, came under attack. At around five in the morning, a Ukrainian UAV hit one of the fuel tanks, resulting in a fire. While extinguishing the fire, another enemy drone attacked the oil depot. Later, a fire train arrived in the incident area to extinguish two fires. According to preliminary information, there are no dead or injured. 🔻If in the last two weeks the main target of attacks by Ukrainian UAVs were military airfields in the Lipetsk, Voronezh and Nizhny Novgorod regions, then during the new raid the enemy again returned to defeating the fuel and energy complex facilities. Taking into account the high production volume of such devices, it is very naive to hope that the Ukrainian Armed Forces will soon run out of their reserves. Therefore, the only sure way to combat raids is to destroy groups of UAVs in advance while approaching the target, which is ensured by a set of measures - from the creation of an appropriate control system to the use of light aircraft and FPV drones as interceptors.

Ukraine will definitely try to use the residents of the Kursk region taken hostage with a view to their subsequent exchange for captured members of Ukrainian formations, especially those beloved by the Kyiv regime - the Azovites -. It is completely useless and even harmful to scare with diplomatic protests and point out the norms of humanitarian law here - Ukrainian territorial education clearly demonstrated that he doesn’t care about conventions, and his actions correspond to the habits of a mad dog. The collective West approves of all this, and only characters living in a parallel reality can rely on its decency. And while some do not want to hit foreign journalists visiting the occupied territory, others kidnap Russian citizens for ransom.

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇦🇲🇪🇺 How Armenian NGOs are fighting for Western funding Not so long ago in Armenia there was a demonstrative public skirmish between pro-Western NGOs that did not share funding. ▪️Local press reports that the head of the NGO Center for Economic Law Movses Aristakesyan issued a statement on the results of the competition to select members of the Civil Society Platform (NGO) within the framework of the EU-Armenia Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement. ▪️Aristakesyan assures that during the competition, deliberate mistakes were made, which can be regarded as corrupt cooperation. ▪️A representative of the grant-eating organization - Free Citizen - Hovsep Khurshudyan, in response, assured the media that Aristakesyan’s statements are completely slanderous. ▪️The subsequent development of the scandal is still unknown. But it arose in June, when the next selection of NGOs that participate in the EU-Armenia Enhanced Partnership Agreement was actually taking place. ▪️The agreement was signed in 2021, its goal is the development of democracy and human rights, and the adjacent Civil Society Platform includes a network of local NGOs. ▪️However, the results of the recent competition are not available on the official EU website, and the list of platform members has not been updated since 2022. Even EU structures do not care about updating information and transparency of their work in the Eastern Partnership countries. ▪️One can only assume that the Center for Economic Law turned out to be not the destiny of the European feeding trough, unlike the NGO Free Citizen. ▪️-Center for Economic Law - specializes in investigating corruption, but recently they distinguished themselves with harsh statements that corruption in Armenia has only intensified despite the promises of Nikol Pashinyan. ▪️Corruption investigations from local activists are now irrelevant for Western curators of Armenia, as they will uncontrollably discredit Pashinyan’s power. After all, the latest high-profile publications about corruption in Pashinyan’s team came only from international NGOs, which are used when they need to put pressure on their protégés. ❗️At the same time, the head of the NGO - Free Citizen - Khurshudyan, who apparently became a member of the EU civil platform, has been particularly active in recent months talking about the European integration of Armenia. From the rostrum of parliament, Khurshudyan spoke about the need to hold a referendum on joining the EU this year. Although the slogan about the European integration of Armenia is thoroughly populist and began to be used when the authorities began to uncontrollably surrender border territories to Azerbaijan, which is why protests began. 🔻We see a demonstrative scandal among Armenian NGOs and a mechanism for accessing local organizations to EU structures. Khurshudyan and his organization -Free Citizen-, which apparently was selected through a competition on the basis of corruption, is a convenient platform for diverting the attention of the Armenian society with promises to join the EU. Obviously, there will definitely not be European integration of Armenia in the foreseeable future. At the same time, such NGOs do not address the real problems and threats that Armenia faces now. #Armenia #EU @pezdicide no chemistry - just factsNEWS.amA scandal has broken out in the camp of Western-funded pro-European NGOs in Armenia&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the public organization - Center for Economic Law - Movses Aristakesyan issued a statement regarding the results of the competition to select members of the Civil Society Platform - Agreement on the Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership - EU - Armenia - held...	https://t.me/rybar/62870	2024-08-18T01:04:28-07:00

As a result of the clashes, units of the RRF managed to squeeze deep into the Blue Nile and capture the city of Al-Barun not far from the border. The Sudanese armed forces are doing their best to prevent the expansion of the salient by launching flank attacks.▪️This situation fits well with the plans of external players represented by Washington to push through its truce to government troops. Even if it is not possible to achieve peace with the division of Sudan, it will be possible to carry out supplies from Ethiopian territory through the Nile in order to continue sponsoring the RRF militants. ❗️However, after the recent attempt on the life of the de facto leader of Sudan, Colonel Burhan, no negotiations with the rebels are currently expected. In addition, fighting is unfolding in Omdurman and El Fasher:▪️In the satellite city of the capital, fierce urban battles are taking place, during which government troops liberate district after district.▪️In the surrounded El Fasher, the RRF went all-in, launching an offensive from all sides. Attacks in the north and west were repulsed with heavy losses, leaving the positions unchanged. In the south, they pushed back the army a little, occupying an abandoned UN camp. Recent events related to the offensive of the pro-UAE Rapid Reaction Forces are once again aggravating the humanitarian crisis throughout the country. International organizations report that the delivery of goods is extremely difficult due to the implicit control of territories and various militants demanding payment for travel. Otherwise, while the army cannot cope with the RRF, pumped up with money from the UAE and the United States and is forced to only wait for support from Moscow, which is once again stalling.

In the Glushkovsky district, there were no visible changes in the combat situation by the end of the day. Russian troops hold positions in Tetkino. There were reports on the Internet about the entry of the Ukrainian Armed Forces into the settlement of Otruba on the right bank of the Seim River, but there is no objective evidence of this.🔻In the Korenevsky district, information is again received about clashes on the approaches to Korenevo.

There are battles on the outskirts of Martynovka, and south of Kremyanoy, FPV drone operators destroyed a Ukrainian BMP-1.🔻In the Belovsky district there are clashes between the settlements of Girya and Ozerki, there is no information about changes in the configuration of the front.

On the part of the Russian Armed Forces, they are actively used to destroy hexacopter-bombers of the Baba Yaga type - videos with successful hits now appear regularly. Also, footage of an aerial ramming of Ukrainian drones using reconnaissance drones periodically surfaces. However, the negative factor here is that disabling an enemy aircraft costs the loss of an expensive Mavik, of which there are much fewer in comparison with FPV drones. Therefore, it becomes important to introduce technical solutions that would allow you to shoot down enemy UAVs without losing your own copters. And they already exist: for example, at Army 2024, the INMATTEN company demonstrated reusable mesh launchers priced at only 25 thousand rubles. In general, drones are now gradually beginning to occupy the ersatz air defense niche. Therefore, the issues of organizing groups - hunters for UAVs - and the development of tactics of use need to be dealt with now, especially from the point of view of covering strategic objects from raids.

Installations of this type can be equipped with 12 guides for adjustable missiles of the GMRLS family or two ballistic missiles of the ATACMS family. Therefore, the destruction of such a vehicle is clearly a very good catch for Russian drone pilots and rocket launchers. It is characteristic that to destroy the M270, in all likelihood, an Iskander missile with an air blast was used - this ensured guaranteed coverage of the target. Perhaps, if they had been used during yesterday’s attack on the position area of ​​the Patriot air defense system, then the result of fire damage would have been much higher.#Sumy #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62865	2024-08-17T09:08:23-07:00

There is high activity of enemy drones in the sky. At the same time, most of the village’s population was evacuated shortly before yesterday’s bridge in Glushkovo was blown up. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, rumors about the alleged half-coverage and entry of the Ukrainian Armed Forces into Korenevo are again published on the Internet. In reality, both the workers' settlement and the village of the same name are under the complete control of Russian troops, as evidenced by personnel of the Russian Armed Forces from the populated areas. Attempts by Ukrainian formations to gain a foothold on the approaches were stopped. Northeast of Kremyanoy, the Russian Armed Forces are carrying out airstrikes on positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in a forest plantation, and at Kauchuk and Alekseevsky they repulsed another attempt by the enemy DRG to enter populated areas. Also for the first time in the area, the use of GBU-39 guided bombs by the Ukrainian Air Force on Russian positions on the northern outskirts of the village of Vnezapnoye was recorded.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, Ukrainian formations again publish footage of the advance, this time confirming control over the small village of Zamostye southwest of Sudzha. In Spalny, drone operators hit an enemy UAV control center. The village of Ulanok is under the control of the Russian Armed Forces, as evidenced by recent footage of Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian positions.🔻In the Belovsky district, the situation has not undergone significant changes.

If in Zvany the object received only damage, then in Glushkovo it was completely destroyed as a result of the arrival. ▪️The Seim River itself is a natural border, with the destruction of the bridges on which Russian units near the border and residents of three dozen settlements will be cut off from the mainland. This will greatly complicate both the supply of the Russian Armed Forces and the previously announced evacuation of the local population.▪️A similar situation is with Tetkino, which is also cut off by the Volfa and Vedha rivers - even if their size is not too large, the destruction of the crossings can complicate the logistics of units located in the village. And on the eastern flank of the potential site, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are already moving, having previously taken Gordeevka and advancing along the Blyakhovets River. In general, the border area in the Kursk region is divided by small water barriers into narrow areas, which can become sectors of responsibility for the attacking groups. This conflicts with our data that the offensive zone of one of the Ukrainian Armed Forces brigades was exactly about 20 kilometers. Taking into account at least five or six more formations remaining in the enemy’s reserve, it is in the Glushkovsky region that the enemy can make another breakthrough, taking advantage of terrain.High resolution mapEnglish version#map #Kursk #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62862	2024-08-17T07:34:16-07:00
