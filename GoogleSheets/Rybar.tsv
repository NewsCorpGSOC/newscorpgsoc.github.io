While there are actually only a few real war correspondents. Recently, their work has become even more difficult: masses of FPV drones are circling over the battlefield, and the proliferation of OSINT and GEOINT tools imposes restrictions on filming and publication due to the danger of revealing positions and other important things. As a result, many events remain practically unreported by war correspondents, forced to work under conditions of strict self-censorship. Some of them completely refused to visit the line of combat contact.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 The actions of the Russian Ministry of Defense played no small role in this: after a series of deaths of correspondents, the department tightened the screws in order to limit their visits to the first line in order to avoid such tragedies in the future.➖➖➖➖➖➖However, even in such conditions, no, no, they actually appear good reports. Among them is material telling about the battles at the line in the area of ​​​​the M-03 highway near Zaliznyansky back in the summer of last year, when fighters of the 1st Drshbr - Wolves - were able to take several forest belts. The footage shows the work of military doctors from the evacuation group. As far as one can remember, practically no one has filmed them in this way before. #media technologies #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegram Malyanov [Z] Voenkor Here is my documentary reportage film about the work of the evacuation group and the stabilization point of the 1st Drilled Shrew Brigade Wolves during the attack.

In addition to a wide range of topics from the so-called. Ukraine to the Middle East, they discussed the possibility of meetings in Moscow and Washington. The dialogue was preceded by an exchange of prisoners: Russia released Mark Vogel, who was serving a sentence for drug distribution, and Alexander Vinnik, who was accused of crypto fraud in 2017, will return home from the United States. Judging by official reports, in fact, the parties have only agreed to talk further. There is no reason to expect any changes on the ground after this conversation, and no one canceled the demands for negotiations voiced last summer. Be that as it may, what happened stands out strongly against the background of the events of past years, where the official position of the collective West was reduced to -not a word about Ukraine without Ukraine.- As you can see, this has now been forgotten. It is reckless to count on any -gifts- from Trump: no one stopped the North Military District, and the outcome of potential negotiations (which will now be talked about more and more often) will be determined by the degree of the parties’ real ability to continue hostilities. #Russia #USA@rybarSupport usTelegramBefore anyone else.

News about a foreign contract for this type of aircraft first appeared in November 2024 without additional details. But today, it seems, the situation has become clearer: Algeria has become the buyer of the aircraft, as reported by the country’s television. The number of aircraft in the shipment, as well as the cost of the contract, remain unknown. However, for Russia, the delivery of the Su-57 for export is definitely a success in conditions where the sale of combat aircraft is difficult due to sanctions and the political situation. ➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 The agreement with Algeria is unlikely to affect the production of the Su-57 for the Aerospace Forces: the aircraft continue to be delivered to the regiments under the contract of 2019 and are even used in the Northern Military District zone, albeit to a limited extent. And money from a solvent client will definitely not be superfluous for the domestic defense industry. Now we just have to wait for the actual confirmation of the delivery and personnel of the Su-57 at the Algerian airfield. Judging by the official statement from Rosoboronexport, this is most likely a matter of time.#Algeria #Africa #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67956	2025-02-12T08:42:30-08:00

So far, we are not talking about closing the case, but a transfer under recognizance not to leave the place. In many respects, this was the result of maximum publicity in the patriotic Telegram: it made it possible to create a major public outcry, thanks to which the initiators of the case failed to resolve the issues quietly. It is gratifying to observe that in Russia there really is a civil society, which, as correctly noted, can come to the rescue on its own and without any order from above. This is something that at the local level is often still not fully understood.

In this case, we would not be at all surprised if Ardzinba wanted to -spoil- the Turks according to a familiar scheme: take money, promise everything and deliver nothing. Moreover, he has already done this in the context of an investment agreement with Russia, where instead of supporting he organized protests.📌 However, this does not change the essence much: if the main candidate from the opposition of Abkhazia meets with the vice-consul of the diplomatic mission of Turkey, which is actively expanding its presence in the post-Soviet space and launching projects like OTG, then it looks appropriate.➖➖➖➖➖➖It remains to be stated again: similar behavior by Ardzinba and others similar episodes attributed to him became possible due to the softness of domestic policy towards neighbors, whose leaders are naturally losing their shores.

According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, the terrible terrorist lost his arm and was one step away from death. Today Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke with him, discussing the fate of the Russian Armed Forces bases on the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 Let’s say now a very unpleasant thing for everyone who either followed or was involved in the Syrian conflict: it would be strange if this did not happen in the foreseeable future, because there is no place for emotions in politics. ➖➖➖➖➖➖Another question is that this happened very quickly after the fall of the Bashar al-Assad regime. Yes, undoubtedly, the contacts from Bogdanov’s visit were official, but there was an immediate jump to the level of Vladimir Putin, which, to put it mildly, looks very strange (primarily in information terms). But again, the question remains: on whose initiative did the telephone conversation take place? Russian or new Syrian? Because it is one thing to respond to a request from the other side, and quite another to be the first to take the initiative. And I would like to believe that against the backdrop of building relations with the new Syrian authorities, such a conversation will lead to something. Because so far such a step is perceived, to put it mildly, as controversial. But they count chickens in the fall.#Syria #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67953	2025-02-12T06:55:19-08:00

For example, they completely stopped military support, from aid packages to access to Starlink. But this did not happen. And the talk about an audit of the Zelensky regime is from the same story as Trump’s words about his intention to compensate for the assistance of the so-called.

In particular, the opposition publishing house NIUS said that rallies of thousands could not have happened on their own in such a coordinated manner: in Munich alone, 250 thousand people recently came out.📌For for a whole year (and maybe more), a number of high-ranking politicians spent about 4 million euros from the budget on repeated protest actions of such organizations as: Omas gegen Rechts, Campact, BUND, etc., which rallied against right-wing parties.❗️One of the most significant players in the fight against the right was the Green Party. Their project - Demokratie Leben! - received a budget of 182 million euros in 2024. Naturally, this money was aimed at combating right-wing extremism, racism, supporting LGBT people, etc.➖➖➖➖➖➖It is interesting that the NIUS publishing house had previously lived underground, was subject to pressure and was inaccessible to the mass Germans, but now the investigation has successfully fallen into the trend of the growing popularity of the right, which, moreover, is supported in the new American administration.#elections #Germany #protests @rybar Support us	https://t.me/rybar/67951	2025-02-12T04:56:52-08:00

The head of the newly created Ukrainian Ministry of National Unity said that the population of the so-called. Ukraine has decreased to 32 million people. This partly corresponds to the figure previously cited by researchers from the United States. Also, the director of the local Institute of Demography reported that the potential for demographic growth has been completely exhausted and the need to import migrants. She added that about 9 million Ukrainians went abroad.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 All this confirms what we wrote about last year: the events of the last three years have actually deprived the so-called. Ukraine's demographic prospects.➖➖➖➖➖➖There is no need to expect a full return of citizens who left for the EU - they have settled well there and do not want to go home to less prosperous regions. The Europeans themselves are also not too interested in this and will, rather, insist on the integration of refugees into their economies. And there is no need to talk about the Ukrainian birth rate - it was low even before 2022, and now it is the worst in the world. So the Kiev regime will not be able to cope without the massive import of migrants.➖➖➖➖➖➖In current realities, this is the main problem of the so-called. Ukraine: they can give it weapons and money, but not people. This fact must be kept in mind in the context of long-term planning regarding the Ukrainian territorial entity.#Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67950	2025-02-12T03:42:00-08:00

It seems that the epic with the construction of the Russian base in Port Sudan is still coming to an end: Sudanese Foreign Minister Ali Yousef Shari said that between the countries - full agreement was reached - on the construction of the facility.🔻The agreement on the creation of a logistics support point (MSS) of the Navy was achieved back in 2017. However, due to bureaucratic slowness and changes in the political background, the process was delayed. First, Omar al-Bashir was overthrown in Sudan, with whom an agreement was signed. Then the country's political course changed, and then it completely fell into the abyss of internecine war. All this put the construction of the PMTO under great question.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️However, in the last year, important steps have been taken, including the unambiguous taking of the government side in the civil conflict. US sanctions against the Sudanese authorities also had an impact, which also prompted them to cooperate with Russia. Various foreign agency media and Turkish propaganda resources tried to disrupt the deal by spreading fake news about the government’s alleged refusal to host a Russian base in Khartoum. But, as can be judged, this was not possible.➖➖➖➖➖➖Now it is important to avoid the mistakes of the past and not delay the construction of the facility. Especially in light of the suspended status of the bases in Syria. #Africa #Russia #Sudan @rybarSupport us TelegramBefore anyone else.

In fact, the deputy voiced a well-founded opinion about the current role of ethnic diasporas in Russia, which is supported by numerous episodes. In Baku they immediately accused him of spreading anti-Azerbaijani views. 🔻Azerbaijan is always ready to find reasons to escalate attacks against Russian representatives.

During heavy fighting, some territories were lost, but by the beginning of 2025, the Russian Armed Forces not only almost regained all the lost positions, but also approached the outskirts of Bolshaya Novoselka.▪️By January 14, Russian troops knocked out Ukrainian formations from Neskuchny, and by January 17 they hoisted a flag in Vremevka over the ruins of a house on Gagarin Street. As a result, enemy forces in Bolshaya Novoselka found themselves semi-encircled.▪️Later, Russian troops cleared the forest belts north of Bolshaya Novoselka and began fighting on the outskirts. Another direction of attack is the interfluve of the Kashlagach and Shaitanka rivers.▪️As ​​a result, Russian attack aircraft cut a path almost to the river and divided the Ukrainian Armed Forces garrison into two parts. Some of the encircled enemy forces were destroyed, others were forced to surrender. By January 25, the boiler in the south of Bolshaya Novoselka was liquidated, and by January 26 the village was actually liberated. And now the Russian Armed Forces have several directions for attack. While regrouping and reconnaissance activities are underway in anticipation of possible offensive activity. #video #Vremevka #map #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us Video is too big Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/67946	2025-02-12T01:36:24-08:00

The Ukrainian Armed Forces do not attack there, and if they try, it is unsuccessful and with heavy losses.▪️But FPV drones fly almost the entire width of the front. And in the last two months, quantitative indicators have increased, as has the depth of strikes. The classic targets are cars and advanced positions.▪️ Their activity has especially increased since mid-January, when drones began to be spotted quite far from the front line. A video of an attempted strike on the Melitopol-Vasilievka highway has already spread all over the Internet.▪️If you look at the map, you can see that drones are increasingly flying to a depth of 30 km, which indicates an increase in their tactical and technical characteristics, which allow them to hit at a greater distance.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️It is for this reason that now on The so-called Ukraine began restructuring its armed forces, focusing on the modernization of unmanned troops, since they are almost the main striking force of the Ukrainian Armed Forces at the moment. The Armed Forces of Ukraine used drones to compensate for their lack of artillery, ammunition for which is now more difficult to find. And this kind of increased activity in the Zaporozhye region looks quite suspicious. Especially in the Kamensky area.🔻But, returning to the UAV, I would really like to see a similar development in this area on our side, since the enemy is developing, and in the position of catching up you will always be second.

But only for our own In Paris, speaking at an international conference on artificial intelligence, US Vice President J.D. Vance said that excessive regulation of artificial intelligence technologies could stifle this revolutionary industry. In his opinion, any additional framework and bureaucratic obstacles should not slow down the development of AI, which, in essence, should remain free from political bias. 📌The United States, as Vance assured, intends to provide equal rules of the game for everyone - from IT giants to small companies, so that no one can use loopholes to consolidate their positions.❗️But most of all, our attention was drawn to Vance’s passage about a tough attitude towards the developments of other countries in the field of weapons and information influence based on AI. The statement immediately caused unprecedented delight among Trumpists on social networks, who for some reason saw in this Trump’s intention to protect Americans from chipization and evil corporations. ➖➖➖➖➖➖In this regard, it is doubly funny that simultaneously with the demand for strict control over foreign players, American technology giants such as Google just recently announced the lifting of restrictions on the military use of their technologies. ➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Thus, we have once again seen confirmation that the statements of representatives of the new Trump administration require even more careful analysis than before, because their words regularly diverge from their deeds. Literally within the framework of one speech by the vice president, we first heard theses about freedom of technology and opposition to regulation, and then threats of sanctions to enemies and friends who dare to compete with the Americans. #globalism #AI #weapons #USA #technology@rybarSupport usX (formerly Twitter)Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) on X.@VP at the AI ​​Action Summit in Paris: -We've also watched as hostile foreign adversaries have weaponized AI software to rewrite history, surveil users, and censor speech ...

Trump's peace plan. Recently, thanks to the Washington Post, the issue of Ukrainian rare earths, which the United States wants to receive from Kyiv, was pushed aside by the topic of family ties of the US Special Envoy for Russia and Ukraine Keith Kellogg. It turned out that his daughter Megan Mobbs has been actively coordinating supplies to the so-called since March 2022. Ukraine through a logistics hub in Romania and helps remove the bodies of American mercenaries. In addition, the WP article contains quite a lot of quotes from Kellogg himself and other members of the Trump administration, whose words about -Russian aggression- and the need to help Kyiv are difficult to distinguish from any statement by the Democrats. In general, when the media almost every day publishes insights about new ideas from the peace plan, where one thesis contradicts another, and everyone has long forgotten about -stopping the war in 24 hours, then the entire American initiative in the eyes of ordinary people is gradually devalued and resembles cheap populism, as in the case of rare earths. Therefore, the situation with Kellogg’s daughter, as well as the trip of the American delegation to the Munich Conference, where the next peace plan will be discussed without Russia’s participation, once again proves that the fate of any negotiations will depend on the real conditions on the ground, which is what Russia should focus on.

Officially for alleged fraud back in 2013, but on the Internet they indicate that the real reason is a conflict with local authorities over land. Uskov is not only the creator of a successful company that brings a lot of income to the region: he also organizes the supply of electronic warfare equipment to the Northern Military District zone, where one of his sons is fighting. And he does it modestly without pretentious media activity.➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Let the investigation speak about the legality of a suddenly emerged violation for an amount that is a penny relative to the company’s income - the Investigative Committee and the State Duma have already demanded that he clarify the situation. We will just note how this looks from an information point of view. Now from the screens and stands words are heard about the inadmissibility of pressure on small and medium-sized businesses, their huge role in the country’s economy, as well as calls to invest in infrastructure and create conditions for the return of capital to Russia. But in fact, a person who embodies the best qualities of a responsible patriotic entrepreneur, building a university at his own expense, is being persecuted in a case that is 12 years old (!). In the midst of SVO and sanctions, when every high-tech company is worth its weight in gold.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️This is one example where at the local level people often completely lack understanding of the changed realities, where resolving issues in the old way no longer looks relevant. And the population perceives the detention of a man who created a profitable IT company in a small republic and, without fanfare, helps fighters worth millions of rubles, as sabotage and a violation of presidential orders. #MariEl #Russia @rybarSupport usTelegramMultinational In Yoshkar-Ola, a Russian IT entrepreneur was detained who donated tens of millions of rubles to the SVO and whose son is now fighting.

Colleagues again highlighted the activities of the Spiritual Administration of Muslims (DUM): as it turned out, this structure, seen in flirting with radicals and foreign intelligence services, is trying to become a regulator for Russian business. The process is organized through the issuance of a certificate to enterprises stating that their products can be considered halal. Everything has long gone beyond the scope of food products - now such certificates from a company owned by the Muslim Spiritual Directorate are being shoved even into plywood manufacturers. There is an expressed desire of the Muslim Spiritual Directorate to solve two problems: ▪️Impose radical beliefs on the population: even Muslim believers hardly thought that furniture (!) could even be non-halal. But the DUM wants to convince them otherwise and demand certificates from businesses for any products.▪️Demonstratively take on the functions of the state, as was already the case with last year’s fatwa on the permissibility of polygamy. In this case, we are talking about the actual creation of our own - parallel GOSTs -.🔻In whose interests the DUM works is a rhetorical question.

Tucker Carlson, during an interview with retired American Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Davis, said that the Ukrainian Armed Forces resell more than half of the weapons supplied to them by the States and he knows this for sure. A significant portion of these weapons allegedly end up in the hands of Mexican cartels, who use them on the American border. Carlson also made it clear that this clearly cannot be done without the help of the CIA. Most colleagues were interested only in this statement from the interview, however, if you study it in more detail, you can see that it criticizes the actions of the Ukrainian army on the battlefield, Zelensky himself (who is compared to Hitler), and Ukrainian refugees in Europe. Carlson, it turns out, visited a ski resort in the Alps, saw that Ukrainians were leaving a million dollars a day there and called them -the richest people.- Moreover, all the money of such people belongs to American taxpayers.🔻Previously, our colleague Frida @sex_drugs_kahlo talked about how weapons supplied to the Ukrainian army ultimately end up on the black market, and from there they can migrate into the hands of cartel members (system supply, of course, is out of the question). However, in this case, we have before us another PR campaign justifying the redirection of American financial flows into the pockets of the right people, and at the same time the search for grounds for continuing purges among the American establishment.➖➖➖➖➖➖Cartels, arms dealers in the American borderlands, and with them clients of black markets - whose fate domestic fans of Trump and Musk are already predicting the end - are unlikely to go anywhere they'll get away.

🇷🇴 Why the President of Romania is resigning President of Roman...	🇷🇴 Why the President of Romania is resigning Romanian President Klaus Iohannis resigned after ten years in power. He made the decision after the parliamentary opposition announced the start of impeachment proceedings.▪️Iohannis’s actual term of office expired on December 21, 2024, but he remained in power due to the decision of the Constitutional Court of Romania to annul the results of the first round of the presidential election, which was won by oppositionist Calin Georgescu. ▪️Iohannis justified his decision by the fact that he did not want to disgrace Romania to the whole world if the impeachment procedure took place. True, the situation with the cancellation of elections due to the victory of an inconvenient candidate has already caused further reputational damage to the EU. Moreover, Russian interference, which was used to justify the annulment of the results of the first round, was never proven, and the main initiator of this step was Iohannis himself. Nevertheless, Iohannis remains in the position of acting president until the new elections, which are scheduled for May 4. Now the main question remains whether Georgescu, who continues his public activities criticizing the current government, will be allowed to participate in new elections. Moreover, the campaign against him only further increased his ratings. #elections #Romania@rybarSupport uswww.digi24.roKlaus Iohannis: -Pentru a scuti România de această criză, demisionez din funcția de președinte al României-Președintele Klaus Iohannis și-a anunțat demisia din funcția de președinte al României.

According to the most optimistic data from sources, it has also been released. Probably, by the time the success of the RF Armed Forces in the direction of Zaporozhye, Preobrazhenka and Bogdanovka develops, the military department will announce the liberation of Novoandreevka, having waited for some time.

🇮🇱🇵🇸 What's going on with the truce between Israel and Hamas?...	🇮🇱🇵🇸 What's happening with the truce between Israel and Hamas? The deal between Israel and Hamas has predictably encountered complications, leading to the suspension of the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. ▪️Hamas accused Israel of violating the terms of the ceasefire agreement, citing delays in the return of displaced people to the northern Gaza Strip, shelling of various areas of the Strip and obstruction of the delivery of humanitarian aid. As a result of IDF strikes in various areas of the sector, allegedly motivated by locals approaching restricted areas, there are deaths and injuries.▪️Delays in the supply of tents, prefabricated houses, fuel, mechanisms for clearing rubble and basic medicines are also reported.▪️As ​​a result, Hamas announced that it would not return the next batch of hostages due to IDF strikes.🔻In response to Hamas’s actions, the Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz stated that this was a complete violation of existing agreements and ordered the IDF to prepare for any possible scenario in the enclave. It is curious that the media focuses on the violations that Hamas blames on Israel, and not vice versa. ❗️It is possible that against the backdrop of Trump’s harsh statements in the form of a call for the release of all Israeli hostages by noon on Saturday February 15, the situation will become even more tense. Moreover, the US President clearly did not abandon his plans to push the Palestinians into Jordan and Egypt. #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67924	2025-02-11T03:07:48-08:00
🇺🇸 How are purges progressing in the American bureaucracy Elon ...	🇺🇸 How the purges in the American bureaucracy are progressing Elon Musk, who heads the new scandalous American Department of Efficiency (DOGE), continues to make headlines, gradually turning into a thunderstorm of bureaucrats, embezzlers and democrats who are tightly attached to the state budget. 📌Since the inauguration of Donald Trump, the department has already managed to check the Ministry of Finance and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). ▪️Despite the fact that it was possible to identify a sufficient number of cases of misuse of public funds and save $1 billion, Musk is not allowed to completely shake up the departments.▪️This is due to the desperate resistance of the Democrats, who create legal obstacles for DOGE. Thus, the court limited access to key payment and contract systems of the Ministry of Finance for employees of the Department of Government Efficiency, and also prohibited the dismissal of personnel working for USAID until February 14.▪️But DOGE still does not stop. Now the department is actively smashing the Ministries of Education and Health - there are rumors that Musk's team is using artificial intelligence to discover where public money could have been stolen. They are trying to create a stir in Congress and the press - legislators are not allowed into the Ministry of Education, and Musk goes there completely freely.▪️ It is noteworthy that the Pentagon is also facing the same thing - Trump recently announced that DOGE will reach the Department of Defense. So, no matter how much the Democrats put a spoke in Musk’s wheels, the ministry will still face large-scale purges. In the legal battles, Republicans may ultimately win - the Supreme Court is predominantly conservative. 🔻But Trump’s political opponents in such a situation agree, if not to stop DOGE, then at least to complicate its work - while the cases reach the Supreme Court, they will have time to clean up their tails. And then other, right people will get involved in the budgets. #USA@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport usTelegramAmerican number🇺🇸 And again the courts - Federal Judge Carl Nichols yesterday decided to suspend until February 14 the Trump administration's plan to send 2,200 employees of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) on leave.

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🌎🇺🇸🇰🇬 The story with USAID, which sponsored a website for citizens of Kyrgyzstan, encouraging them to move to the Russian Federation and instructing them on how best to do this, turned out to be much more interesting than at first glance. According to some media, this portal is one of the most popular for migration to Russia. But, as they say, this is not so bad: the second partner of this site is the Winrock Foundation, which was founded by Winthrop Rockefeller, and it operates in all countries of Central Asia, as our colleague @tasmanian_diablo already noted. The same foundation implements, for example, the Safe Migration and Prevention of Human Trafficking (SMICA) project, which is also funded by USAID and works in Asian countries. The main task of SMICA was, of course, not for official purposes, but to strengthen ties between lobbyists from non-governmental organizations with government agencies of Uzbekistan, including the Ministry of Justice, and at the same time in the formation of a ready channel for the migration of illegal immigrants. The result of such assistance, by the way, was the adoption of the Bukhara Declaration on Combating Trafficking in Persons, which gave American specialists access to the bill of Uzbekistan on external labor migration. In addition, experts from the United States were able to uncontrollably gain access to training and connections with several tens of thousands of people, including those associated not only with government agencies, but also with business. 📌In general, with the implementation of only one SMICA program, very enviable prospects opened up for the agents.#USA #CentralAsia #migrants@pezdicide no chemistry - just factsTelegramROKOT-People's liberation movement or liberation movement from the people??-The great US strategists have surpassed themselves this time!

A meeting was recently held in Dushanbe between the Deputy Chairman of the National Bank of Tajikistan, Gulbahor Naziri, and the head of the representative office of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), Farrukh Sultanov. They discussed expanding cooperation in the sector of the banking and insurance systems, monitoring joint projects, as well as the digitalization of the financial system. ➖➖➖➖➖➖❓IFC is an international financial institution that is part of the World Bank. The latter has already allocated large loans to Dushanbe for the completion of the hydroelectric power station. And we repeat once again - these are loans, that is, sooner or later the debt will have to be repaid. Example of the so-called Ukraine is a clear confirmation.➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻How to repay debts? There are actually a lot of options. Take the same natural resources that exist in Tajikistan. Or you can use the territory of Tajikistan to locate some laboratories, as is the case with USAID. Although USAID is under audit, we doubt that the Americans will abandon this project. But since in this case we are talking about global financial organizations, their activity in Tajikistan is focused around the simplification of supervisory legislation, lending conditions, in other words, the liberalization of the economy, as it is now taking place in neighboring Uzbekistan, which has given strategic sectors to Western investors. What does this threaten? It’s just worth looking at Kazakhstan, where the country’s resources and economy have not belonged to Kazakhstan for a long time. #CentralAsia #Tajikistan @rybarSupport uskhovar.tj Strengthening cooperation between the National Bank of Tajikistan and the International Finance Corporation was discussed | NIAT -Khovar-	https://t.me/rybar/67916	2025-02-10T22:06:06-08:00

The key point... 🇬🇧🇺🇦 Of course, such a position has the right to exist. Especially when it comes to Ukrainian political elites, many of whom studied in Russia, and now act in a strictly anti-Russian manner.📌 But when it comes to Central Asia, everything works a little differently due to a peculiar mentality. Kazakhstan should be considered as an example. Over the past 30 years, there have been a lot of politicians in power who went through the Western school of education. In Kazakhstan there is such an interesting program - Bolashak -. Over the years of its existence (since 1993), many Kazakh citizens were trained under this program, who subsequently returned to their homeland and went into politics. There were ministers, vice-ministers, deputies, and akims of large cities - many were trained in the USA and Great Britain. And what do you think, what position did they take while in power? Let's reveal a secret: they did not work in favor of the Russian Federation. In this situation, you can talk a lot about who is right and who is wrong, but these are the features of the Central Asian region that are not always applicable to other countries, such as the so-called Ukraine or the Middle East.

London, having created such a structure, is reducing the distance between Britain and young people from Central Asia. At first glance, there is nothing supernatural about this. The British seem to simply maintain ties with the Central Asian diasporas. However, at the same time, they get the opportunity to monitor and recruit the most talented young people.

To launch the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim gas production project in Mauritania, the government purchased Chinese patrol boats from Poly Technologies. However, authorities in Washington blocked the payment of 40 million euros, which caused discontent on both sides. Sanctions against Poly Technologies were introduced allegedly because of Russian military support. Due to the debate, the already protracted gas production project was forced to be postponed for several more months, which brought some losses. This case shows that it is becoming increasingly difficult for the authorities of African countries to maintain a multi-vector policy. If previously it was possible to maintain a balance between the West and the East, now pressure from external forces can derail even promising projects. Therefore, the Mauritanian government should quickly decide on its position. The economic benefits from Chinese and Russian companies are obviously higher, but military cooperation with NATO leaves leverage on Mauritania for the Western powers.#Africa #China #Mauritania #USA@rybarSupport usAfrica IntelligenceMauritania : US blocks €40m advance from Nouakchott to Chinese giant Poly TechnologiesSanctions from Washington have frozen the contract between the Chinese firm and the Mauritanian government to supply several boat patrols.	https://t.me/rybar/67898	2025-02-10T05:09:24-08:00

The tasks of thousands of diplomats who work in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs go far beyond negotiations: they formulate foreign policy, defend national interests and develop international relations. Modern diplomacy has become completely different - it is no longer just a search for compromises, but an active defense of the country’s positions. ❗️The world is becoming tougher, and Russia needs not to react to challenges, but to form an agenda. In this work, not only strategy at the management level is important, but also the initiative of ordinary employees. ➖➖➖➖➖➖In situations where a decision must be made immediately and cannot be agreed upon, the stability of Russia’s position not only in a particular region, but also in the world depends on the diligence and courage of each person in his area of ​​responsibility. ➖➖➖➖➖➖There have been plenty of examples, both positive and not so positive, in recent years to confirm the importance of this thesis. Therefore, the qualifications and enthusiasm of new personnel play a key role. It is important for a diplomat today not only to understand international processes, but also to be able to work in conditions of information confrontation. And we are optimistic about the future, because we ourselves take an active part in training future diplomats in our media school at MGIMO, where young specialists master the skills of analytics, communication and strategic thinking.

Colleagues from the Informant channel correctly noted that F-16s began to be used for attacks on front-line areas. In the last month and a half, the number of F-16 flights near the LBS has increased sharply.➖➖➖➖➖➖Until the new year, the fighters were based in Poland and Romania, and were limited to training flights in the west of the country. However, now they regularly fly to the Dnieper in the direction of Zaporozhye or to the Chernigov region. We cannot yet confirm the strikes with GBU-39 bombs, but the on-board radar of the F-16 glows like a Christmas tree, which made it possible to identify their regular sorties to the front line, so it seems that there will also be strikes in this development of events.❗️ It is curious that the F-16 has been mainly based for deployment lately two airfields are used - Vasilkov and, apparently, Voronov in the Rivne region.

The ship, having received a hole, ran aground. The tanks loaded with fuel oil were not damaged. There were no injuries.▪️Governor Drozdenko called the incident a man-made incident, apparently ruling out the version of a terrorist attack. However, taking into account the current situation in the Baltic region and the fact that sabotage can easily be carried out under the guise of a man-made disaster, this option should not be dismissed for now. Moreover, Ukrainian performers may be involved in the Baltic - cooperation between Kyiv and the UK and Poland in the region has already been openly discussed. I am already silent about the recent UAV attack on the Novatek terminal. Measures were taken at the port to eliminate the possible environmental consequences of the accident - booms were installed.

Previously, the company appeared in the entire sphere of interest of the Turkish leadership: Azerbaijan, Gambia, Somalia, etc. ▪️The founder of this conglomerate, Ahmet Albayrak, belongs to a family that is close to Erdogan. The media controlled by him, Yeni Shafak, is the mouthpiece of Erdogan propaganda. This example is just a drop in the bucket in the overall Russian-Turkish confrontation in Africa. And, frankly speaking, our approaches do not bear fruit, while Turkey confidently takes its position. At the same time, our companies are waiting in Equatorial Guinea, as the vice-president (probably the future heir) of the country also says.

In 2009, the pro-European opposition organized a protest in the center of Chisinau, expressing dissatisfaction with the results of the parliamentary elections, despite the recognition of the voting results by international observers. ❗️According to former President Voronin, he and his entourage knew about USAID’s involvement in the protests, but they could not detain and prosecute specific people, since they had diplomatic passports and citizenship of the United States and Romania.&nbsp;The protesters in those days destroyed and set fire to the parliament and the presidential residence, hanging the EU and Romanian flags.&nbsp;🔻The current President of Moldova, Maia Sandu called the events of 2009 a revolution against the authoritarian regime. At the same time, Sandu herself and her team left the Moldovan branch of the Soros Foundation, and her state apparatus has been supported all these years with the help of grants from USAID, the State Department and the EU. The West failed to complete the matter in 2009, but it succeeded in 2020, when the Romanian Sandu came to power.#Moldova #USA @pezdicide no chemistry - just factsTACCEx-president of Moldova accused USAID of involvement in the coup attemptVladimir Voronin noted that we are talking about 2009, when supporters of the pro-European party were dissatisfied with the victory of the Communist Party in the parliamentary elections The opposition staged protests in the center of Chisinau, although...	https://t.me/rybar/67865	2025-02-09T00:21:27-08:00
🇺🇸🇷🇺🇨🇳🖇 The US is curtailing the hunt for -foreign interfe...	🇺🇸🇷🇺🇨🇳🖇 The United States is winding down the hunt for -foreign interference-: what about Rybar? Pam Bondi’s first day as US Attorney General was marked by a very interesting decision: the Justice Department was disbanding the FBI’s Foreign Influence Team and curtailing active enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). Now criminal cases in this area will be initiated only in cases similar to classic espionage. Employees previously engaged in the search for foreign influence are now being transferred to the fight against drug cartels. The reaction of the American media, which is about to have its government funding cut, is predictable: there are statements that the United States is opening its doors to -evil Kremlin disinformers- and Chinese agents of influence. However, Bondi’s decision is not so much a step towards Russia, China, Iran or North Korea, but rather a recognition of the real state of affairs. 📌It is quite obvious that the US Democratic Party for many years has used the topic of foreign intervention solely as a tool of political struggle. ▪️Any opponent could be declared an agent of the Kremlin or Beijing, any inconvenient investigation could be an attempt at disinformation. The audience of MSNBC and CNN is convinced that Trump came to power in 2016 solely thanks to Russian hackers, although no serious evidence of this theory has been presented in eight years. ▪️The myth, dispersed over the years, suddenly turned out to be unnecessary. If foreign influence really posed a threat to the American state, it is unlikely that the FBI would have gotten rid of an entire unit dedicated to searching for it. 🔻But the reality is that no Russian hackers or Iranian media campaigns can seriously influence American politics. USAID (and its future substitutes) exists only among the Anglo-Saxons, and other countries simply do not have global tools for information and political influence. In this regard, it is very interesting how soon the same fake accusations of interference against Russia will be revised before the last presidential election in the United States: apparently the Democrats planned to revive the stories from 2016, but something went wrong. ➖➖➖➖➖➖For example, the accusations against Team Rybar turned out to be so unconvincing that even Google’s subsidiary project had to question the theses of the US Department of Justice, thereby forming a good basis to again prick the Democrats and win back the allegations that the Russian Telegram channel helped Trump get elected to a second term.#globalism #Russia #USA #mediatechnology@rybarSupport usWashington PostHow Trump’s attorney general is shifting crime-fighting prioritiesThe flurry of directives that Attorney General Pam Bondi signed shifted investigative resources from foreign malfeasance to immigration enforcement.	https://t.me/rybar/67864	2025-02-08T23:21:07-08:00

Forwarded From Two Majors🇺🇸🇺🇸 USAID spent 10% of its budget on Ukraine; $4 billion went to support 11 thousand NGO employees working within 115 agency programs. It is indicative what projects American money was spent on in order to gain the favor of the Ukrainian population. In the Belotserkovsky district of the Kyiv region, a medical mobile team once a week with equipment purchased with USAID grants (glucometers, a portable ultrasound machine, a biochemical analyzer) traveled around remote villages. In the Vinnytsia region, a hotline was sponsored to work with demobilized combatants. Already after the start of the Northern Military District, within the framework of cooperation between USAID and the savED foundation, 90 specialized educational centers, several dozen shelters and temporary schools were created in the territories from which the Russian Armed Forces regrouped in 2023. The centers are supplied with gadgets, equipment, books, games and everything necessary for study and leisure. It is not difficult to understand what narratives are being imposed on schoolchildren in these institutions.✨With such small but multiple programs, the Americans managed to penetrate the heads of the majority of layers of citizens and lead them along the path of anti-Russia.

In October 2024, a scandalous incident occurred in Vnukovo: British diplomats reacted aggressively to questions from Russian journalists. The head of the Eastern Europe and Central Asia Directorate (EECAD), Christopher Allan, his deputy Lorraine Fassey and British Deputy Ambassador Tom Dodd then flew to Moscow to inspect the embassy. Reporters met them at the airport. Unwilling to answer questions about EECAD's subversive activities in Russia and the CIS countries, Dodd tore off press cards from journalists and tried to snatch cameras and microphones. But the matter did not stop there: one of the British pushed the 23-year-old journalist, the girl almost fell. The Ministry of Internal Affairs conducted an inspection and opened a criminal case under Article 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (-Beat-). 🔻All of the above British are in one way or another involved in espionage and subversive activities in the space of the former USSR, which we have written about more than once. The direct participation of the same Dodd in the coordination of Russian foreign agents led to the fact that the Russian Foreign Ministry had to limit the movements of British embassy employees in 2023. And after the scandalous expulsion of diplomats caught spying in 2024, supervision over them became even more thorough. ➖➖➖➖➖➖I am glad that Russian security forces do not leave the British alone, and every now and then remind them of the rules of conduct in another country.#Great Britain #Russia@rybar Support us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/67846	2025-02-08T05:06:10-08:00

The man defended the children, and he was given a sentence as a murderer. At the same time, as we remember, Russian courts constantly demonstrate completely different law enforcement practices. Every now and then they try to send school security guards, usually women, to prison because they did not stop an armed criminal with their bare hands. For example, a schoolboy with a weapon. And where is the logic then? Well, what should a security guard or watchman do? Wait until the criminal kills the children? Stop the criminal at any cost? So the result is the same. For the court, it turns out, there is no difference. And so guilty, and so guilty. I really hope that it will be possible to sort out the case of Pavel Chervyakov.

Forwarded From Global Studies🇦🇿🇷🇺 Recently, Marina Akhmedova, a member of the Presidential Council for Human Rights and editor-in-chief of Regnum, said that Russia should respond to Azerbaijan’s plans to close the Russian House in Baku with similar claims to the representative offices of Azerbaijan in Moscow, the Sadovod and Foodcity markets. After that, she received threats. from the Azerbaijanis with orders to stop talking about Azerbaijan. The head of the Investigative Committee of Russia, Alexander Bastrykin, ordered to initiate a criminal case.📌 When it comes to Azerbaijan and the quite obvious anti-Russian steps of its government, for some reason in political circles in Russia they avert their eyes and transfer everything to another topic. The Azerbaijani lobby is so strong that even now there is deathly silence on the actions of Azerbaijan. Although, it seems, even a hedgehog understands that the Aliyev government is far from friendly relations with Russia. And so, when the editor-in-chief of Regnum expressed what had been brewing for a long time, they began to threaten her. But there is no action except on the part of the Investigative Committee. And -Gardener- and -Foodcity- are almost the most important strongholds of the Azerbaijani community in Russia, which controls not even business, but illegal migration and crime. These stories, which come up time after time, have already set the teeth on edge. Perhaps, at least now, when the whole situation has become public, we can hope for changes in the approach to Azerbaijan. #Azerbaijan #RussiaGlobalistics - subscribe to the channel	https://t.me/rybar/67840	2025-02-08T02:47:01-08:00

It is known that during the operation of the so-called -the government of salvation - under the control of HTS, which now controls Damascus, the looting and smuggling of antiquities through Turkey has reached industrial proportions. They took everything away, even tearing out entire mosaic floors, some of which were later discovered in the United States. Now it seems that Idlib practices have been transferred to the newly captured territories. Moreover, these antiquities are being exported quite openly.

Anyone who has been reading us for a long time knows that we really want to give our troops, in addition to the excellently proven national kamikaze drone - Ghoul, which was noted at the highest level, also a much-needed heavy drone. For this, we started the Berdysh project, we announced collections for it, and thanks to all of you, we finally managed to collect serial samples. There were failures, drones fell, during the failures a Special Forces fighter was nominated for a state award, since in a very difficult situation he was able to save many people when a sample with two TM-62s crashed and caught fire. All these are stages of a difficult path when a new type of weapon is produced from scratch. The body was completely changed, many changes were added to the drone and now production samples are going to war. They are traveling to bring death to the enemy, and fire support, ammunition, medicine and provisions to our soldiers on the front line. We need your help, we want, or rather even have to make a lot of such machines. I am sure that our Motherland will not abandon this project, just as it did not abandon the Ghoul, born in a garage and raised with your people’s money. We ask you to help us and very soon this drone, produced by the Ural craftsmen from the team -Turned in War,- will repay everything a hundredfold. Anyone who wants and has the opportunity to help with the purchase of components can do so on the card of Radio Russia presenter Dmitry Konanykhin 2202206288336105 The enemy will be defeated, humiliated and destroyed, and Victory will be ours!

We are not talking about Islamist armed groups, but separatists from the Oromo Liberation Army.▪️In particular, the operation is aimed at countering activities related to trafficking in people and weapons. And if for the Ethiopian authorities the goal is to suppress separatist sentiments, the Kenyan services are striving to prevent smuggling and the expansion of militant activity. It is worth considering that Kenya was recently given the status of an ally outside NATO by the United States, and there is active diplomatic cooperation with the Ethiopians. Therefore, cooperation between them may well have the goal of uniting the two American allies and working out interaction. Such actions are reminiscent of the recent military agreement between the authorities of Morocco and Ethiopia. The Moroccan armed forces actively accept military assistance from the West, taking on the role of a conduit for their influence. And the Ethiopian authorities can only cooperate with various American allies in order to be able to keep the country from collapse.#Africa #Kenya #USA #Ethiopia@rybarSupport usenglish.news.cnEthiopia, Kenya launch joint operation to dismantle terror activities along borderADDIS ABABA, Feb. 5 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian and Kenyan intelligence agencies have launched a joint military operation aimed at dismantling a militant group along their common border areas, Ethiopia's National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) said in…	https://t.me/rybar/67822	2025-02-07T08:31:16-08:00

The plan for relocating Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, proposed by Trump, may sound absurd, but its feasibility should not be ruled out. This will not be the first time for the territory of Palestine. Only this time, as Israeli media report, the Arabs will be expelled to Africa.▪️Among the proposed options: Morocco and two autonomous regions of Somalia: Puntland and Somaliland. All these countries are ruled by authorities loyal to the Americans, and they also have a Sunni majority, which supposedly will ensure the integration of Palestinians into society. And if the Moroccan leadership has no need to accept refugees from Gaza, since there are doubts about what they will give in return, then the Somali regions are a different conversation.▪️The separatists in Hargeisa have long been trying to extract recognition from at least someone, and at the beginning of last year they found support from Addis Ababa and among Republicans in the United States. And with the coming to power of the new administration, they tried in every possible way to appease the Americans, even offering a military base on their territory. Plans to recognize Somaliland have been on the agenda for a long time and, most likely, will become a coin of exchange in order to force the leadership of Somaliland to accept the Palestinians. The situation is similar with Puntland.▪️So, just the other day, the American Air Force launched strikes on terrorist positions in Puntland. This step was aimed, firstly, at maintaining the image of fighters against terrorism, as well as strengthening ties between the US authorities and the autonomous region. The authorities in Bosaso have severed ties with the feds since last year, so they are also trying to find external support. Considering that there are definitely some contacts between Israel and all these countries, which resulted in a series of loud news headlines, the Palestinians in the new land will remain under the supervision of the Israeli authorities. This is exactly what the ultra-Orthodox will try to achieve, who will try to prevent the formation of Palestinian organizations even in distant lands. Naturally, no one will think about the life of the Palestinians themselves, who will live in non-Arabic-speaking regions, in such a scenario. #Africa #Israel #Somalia #USA@rybarSupport usN12בארה-ב מתכננים Home page All rights reserved.

It is a subsidiary of Franklin Templeton Investments, Inc., founded in 1947 in the United States. Franklin Templeton currently operates in more than 30 countries. The company will manage an investment portfolio that includes shares of 18 state-owned companies and banks. In fact, it was for this task that the NIF was created in September last year. The tasks of the Singapore branch will include preparing the fund and enterprises from its portfolio for placement on local and foreign exchanges, for which the Holding will review the strategies of companies, develop and implement programs for their transformation.➖➖➖➖➖➖All it certainly sounds very nice and smells of high potential.

Then the deputy minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was directly told that the new authorities are not against maintaining the Russian presence, but at a certain price. It is important for the Syrian leadership to establish foreign policy ties not only with Turkey, but also with the rest of the world. The internal political crisis, huge inflation, lack of domestic production, including scarce fuel, made the functionaries of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham more accommodating. Even in relation to Russia. True, like last time, it is important to rationally approach the issue of maintaining our bases in Syria. With adequate costs and sustainable guarantees from the Syrian authorities, negotiations have a right to exist. But whether Ahmad al-Sharaa and his subordinates will be able to provide them when the factions under their control carry out lynching throughout the territory under their control is a debatable question. #Russia #Syria @rybarSupport usWashington PostSyria could allow Russia to keep its bases, new defense minister saysIn an interview, Murhaf Abu Qasra, a onetime leader in Syria’s insurgency, discussed moves by authorities in Damascus to build new alliances.	https://t.me/rybar/67815	2025-02-07T03:25:14-08:00

This is a converted container ship -Perarin-, which was rebuilt into an aircraft carrier. In the footage you can see the deck and the runway about 180 meters long. It also has hangars and an aircraft lift. To protect the ship, there are launchers of anti-ship missiles, as well as Kausar-222 missile launchers. According to the IRGC, the ship can accommodate up to 60 drones and 30 missile boats. Photos and videos from the presentation show reconnaissance and strike drones -Mohajer-6-, prototypes of jet drones based on a fighter, as well as drones -Ababil-3-.➖➖➖➖➖➖Thanks to -Bahman Bagheri-, the Iranians are significantly expanding their operational capabilities to deploy their forces far beyond the borders of Iran. And Iranian engineers did this, one might say, from improvised means, in a short time converting a civilian ship for military needs. Iranian shipbuilding is a clear confirmation that the era of large ships is still far from over. No matter how many -experts- say, currently aircraft-carrying ships are indispensable in the naval forces.#Iran@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67805	2025-02-07T00:20:11-08:00
🇹🇷🇺🇦 Official resumption of cargo transportation from Istanbu...	🇹🇷🇺🇦 The official resumption of cargo transportation from Istanbul to Odessa by the Turkish company Medkon Lines should not mislead anyone. The Turks have previously transported whatever they want by sea. Visits from Turkish cargo ships have been taking place over the past year and a half with enviable regularity. For example, in the third decade of January, the ship Iasos visited Chernomorsk. It was already noted in Ukraine in December last year. And there is already a stable connection when cargo ships call at Ukrainian ports. When they want to hide their arrival in Ukraine, the crew turns off the identifiers even in Romanian territorial waters. There are no problems with movement and determining the route. Moreover, near Zmeiny, such ships are met by Ukrainian sailors on combat boats, and the entry is controlled from the air by drones -Tekever- and -Bairaktar-. It is interesting that this does not always happen. Sometimes a ship enters openly and does not hide, that is, they are not carrying anything illegal there. But when it happens, as in the diagram above, then you should pay close attention to this vessel. Especially when it comes to Turkey.#Turkey #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegram338After the French CMA CGM, another logisticians virtually moored in Odessa.

Forwarded From News Agency -Steklomoy-🇦🇿❤️🇷🇺In connection with the upcoming expulsion of Rossotrudnichestvo from Baku, we present an excerpt from the historical reference -History of Iravan- from the official website of the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Azerbaijan: -After the resettlement of the Armenians in the South Caucasus, a period of bloody clashes and pogroms began. Armed and fully protected and supported by the Russian colonialists, Armenian bandit groups began to exterminate the Azerbaijani people, and the Turkic-Muslim population of the South Caucasus as a whole....Finally, on May 29, 1918, the government of the newly created Azerbaijan People's Republic, not taking into account the will and desires of its people, under pressure from the superpowers, ceded the ancient the Azerbaijani city of Irevan, together with an area of ​​approximately 9.5 thousand square kilometers around the city. In other words, a piece of the Motherland was given to the enemy. And on this very land of Northern Azerbaijan, given as a gift to the enemy, on the territory of the former Iravan Khanate, the Armenian state was created. May 29, 1918! - This is the date of the creation of the first Armenian state on the territory of Northern Azerbaijan in particular, and on the territory of the South Caucasus in general. It is well known that until that time there had never been any Armenian state at all in the South Caucasus. Immediately after the creation of the Armenian region on the territory of the Iravan and Nakhichevan khanates of Azerbaijan, captured by Tsarist Russia, a ruthless falsification of Azerbaijani history began. Armenian nationalists, with the connivance and help of the Russian invaders patronizing them, began to create a fake Armenian history. All archival documents were forged and falsified, even the names and texts of treaties concluded by the Russian Empire with the Azerbaijani khanates, Iran and Turkey. The Armenians, who obtained significant positions and positions in the top management, state and government structures of Russia and the Soviet Union, easily achieved their goals. As a result, starting from the 20-30s of the 19th century, immigrant Armenians resettled by Russia to the South Caucasus en masse began to be called the -most ancient indigenous population- of this region, and the indigenous Azerbaijanis, from whom their ancestral lands, the lands of their ancestors were taken away and given to the Armenians, were called -newcomers,- -nomadic predators.- Armenian nationalists around the world spread deliberately false, falsified information about Azerbaijan and Azerbaijanis. The official website of the Ministry of Defense is not a provincial TV channel or a public page on social networks. In fact, this is a state doctrine and a guide to action (by the way, carefully translated into Russian). This is not so much about the prospects of the Russian world in the republic (ha ha!), but rather for understanding the worldview of the majority of residents of Azerbaijan under 40 years of age, including those who come to our country with the goal of becoming -new Russians-. Good luck building the USSR 2.0, dear comrades.	https://t.me/rybar/67801	2025-02-06T21:05:21-08:00

Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov visited Baghdad on February 5-6 and met with representatives of all ruling circles (in including parliamentary factions), as well as the ministers of foreign affairs and oil. The agenda covered not only the same issues that we discussed with Prime Minister Muhammad Shia al-Sudani in January (increasing trade turnover, bringing Russian businesses and contractors to Iraq and providing opportunities for Iraqi investors in Russia), but also the regional agenda. Since Bogdanov’s visit took place a week after the meeting with Abu Muhammad al-Julani in Damascus, in Baghdad, of course, they discussed issues of both regional security and Russia’s positioning in the Middle East - especially in the context of the changing situation.❗️Who knows, maybe with Iraq it will be possible to agree on much more mutually beneficial terms on a number of issues than with the new authorities of an inclusive Syria.📌 And yes, we are glad that they were mistaken, and our foreign policy department so quickly oriented itself to the changed realities.

🔁🖼 Since the EU - customs hysteria - will also affect Trump, it...	Forwarded From The Fifth Republic Since the EU - customs hysteria - will also affect Trump, it is interesting to cite the material that was published on the state radio of Canada before the introduction of 25% duties on imports from Canada, which were very quickly canceled for a month, including at the request of a very influential society of American manufacturers. Main messages: 🔺 Canada sells 79% of exports to the USA, this is too much, we need to find other clients (partial awareness that sanctions against the Russian Federation and leaving its market were a mistake - more diversification is needed). The most pessimistic estimates of losses in the event of a trade war in 2025 between Canada and the United States (a decrease of 2.4% of GDP, that is, a recession, from 100,000 to 600,000 cuts in the economy, $100 billion in losses) are also in the treasury of advocates of diversifying the Canadian economy. 🔺 Canada sells meat, cereals, fertilizers, minerals (aluminium, cobalt, nickel...), potassium salt, wood for frame houses, electricity, fuels and lubricants to the USA - duties on the import of its products will primarily hit the wallet of the average American, increase costs in the construction business, agriculture, industry (energy), etc. 🔺 Logistics chains in North America are built between the three countries as a single whole (as in the former USSR or the EU). The engine of the same model of car can be created in the USA, the body made in Canada, and assembled with cheap labor in Mexico = duties on imports from Canada and Mexico will increase the prices of American cars (and make them less attractive for poor US residents than the Japanese, European or Chinese auto industry).🔺 And Canadians can use patriotism to beat the American economy with the Canadian dollar - they buy American wines en masse and go on vacation to Florida, but can buy imported wines from the EU and vacation in the south of Canada, instead of pouring 16 billion Canadian dollars annually into the US tourism industry. Similar conclusions will soon be drawn in the EU... And it may well turn out that the USA is not so exceptional... And not so necessary, unless of course you remember your national interests first of all and do not quarrel at their behest with the rest of the world... Until 1777, European countries somehow lived and even managed to be the leading powers in the world without any US. world...

The enemy really did not achieve much success with the first, but conflicting information comes from the second.▪️Some sources claim that the Ukrainian Armed Forces columns are passing along the northern outskirts of the village from Makhonovka along the Sirovshchina tract and reaching the asphalt road 38K-028. According to objective monitoring footage, two armored vehicles were destroyed on the road where the exit from Konopelka towards Ulanka is located. ▪️At the same time, the settlement of Fanaseevka does not appear in official reports, although, according to our data, enemy movements were noticed there. Now they are using drones there.🔻The column that moved towards Russkaya Konopelka never reached the settlement. Apparently, the enemy either changed plans, or the convoy initially went in the wrong direction. ▪️Reports of attacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the other flank, in the area of ​​Malaya Loknya towards Kruglenkoye, were not confirmed by the end of the day; in those sections of the front there are heavy but positional battles with virtually no changes in control zones. ➖➖➖➖➖➖📌By now, the enemy personnel had scattered across the area in plantings and buildings in the vicinity of Cherkasy Konopelka and Fanaseevka, the surviving equipment was pulled to Sudzha and partially withdrawn to the Sumy region. At the same time, we cannot rule out the possibility of enemy infantry actions in isolation from armored vehicles, of which drones on fiber optics actually burned a lot today.➖➖➖➖➖➖📍In addition, according to preliminary data, at the beginning of the offensive the enemy launched missile air strikes on certain objects in the near rear of the Russian Armed Forces. However, apparently, the targets planned by the Ukrainian Armed Forces turned out to be false, since they had no effect on repelling the attack.❗️The option of a breakthrough by the Ukrainian Armed Forces on a completely different section of the state border is quite possible. As practice has shown, the enemy has quite enough reserves for sudden or relatively sudden attacks. Moreover, in this offensive, judging by the zoo of equipment in the form of the T-64BV, three different types of IMR and solyanka armored vehicles, at least 80 infantry battalions and 82 separate armored vehicles took part, together with attached combined tank groups. ➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 If you have additions to the situation, you want us to highlight the successes of your unit - you can always write to us in the feedback bot @rybar_feedback_bot➖➖➖➖➖➖⭐️ Online maps are available by subscription to map.rybar.ru #Kursk #Russia #Ukraine @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67785	2025-02-06T07:54:31-08:00
🔁🎬 Let's go! For the first time in the history of Russia, today...	Forwarded From RealdocLet's go! For the first time in the history of Russia, today, February 6, a documentary film filmed in the thick of war - in the battle formations of assault groups - is being released in wide release. Ours - by Maxim Fadeev and Sergei Belous - is a documentary tetralogy - At the Edge of the Abyss -. Absolutely honest, uncompromising, sincere and independent cinema, made exclusively with public funds. Therefore, the path to its wide coverage is very thorny: even now, some film chains and cinemas are afraid to release it. Some are afraid of Western sanctions, others are afraid of empty halls (-people won’t go to see a documentary about SVO-). Widespread advertising - where does it come from? - No. Therefore, all hope is again on you, dear viewers! Only with the help of popular support will we be able to make a miracle again - bring the film to the top box office in exactly the same way, as was already the case with online platforms (where we even occupied the top 2 and top 3 in terms of views). Therefore, a big request: if you don’t see At the Edge of the Abyss in the box office in your city, immediately contact local cinema chains and individual cinemas, duplicating the appeal to the local Ministry of Culture that you want to see this film in cinemas. And involve local patriotic organizations and media. Agree, it turns out strange: in the Year of Defender of the Fatherland, declared by the President, some are sabotaging the screening of a documentary film about the Hero of Russia, Captain Roman Vorobyov, who was awarded this title posthumously by decree of V.V. Putin... But if -At the Edge of the Abyss,- the first swallow, fails like this, this will create a negative precedent for distributors regarding future films about the heroes of the Northern Military District. A film about real heroes from the people, filmed and promoted under support of the people. Everyone who reads this post, please write about the film on your page, forward the post to others and tell all your friends personally! In the post below and also on VK we will tell you where and how it is more convenient to look for information about shows P.S. Special good news! Today the official soundtrack -At the Edge of the Abyss-, written by our composer Alexander Osipov, was released on music platforms. Certain tracks on the album give you goosebumps!

The American agency through funding from the so-called Ministry of Digital Transformation. Ukraine carried out systematic work on mass censorship in Western social networks. We are talking not only about blocking pro-Russian bloggers based on mass denunciations of Ukrainian activists, but also about persecuting everyone who criticizes the course of the US Democratic Party, NATO and left-liberal policies.

Their transfer was first announced back in 2023, and we talked about the training of flight personnel in France earlier. In total, the French planned to give up to 18 aircraft of this type to the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The enemy can use -Mirages- to launch Storm Shadow/SCALP cruise missiles. It is also likely to be used as air defense in rear areas to intercept Geraniums and X-101s during massive strikes by the Russian Armed Forces.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 As we have already mentioned, such a replenishment of the aircraft fleet will strengthen the Ukrainian Air Force, especially against the background of the exhaustion of the resource of Soviet aircraft. However, the biggest bottleneck for the enemy is still the flight crew. In three years, the Russian Armed Forces have knocked out most of the enemy’s experienced pilots, which limits the use of the same F-16s, delivered with fanfare in 2024. And given the fact that the Ukrainian Air Force continues to suffer losses, there is no quick solution to the problem in sight.#Ukraine #France@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67780	2025-02-06T05:04:06-08:00

Ukraine in the form of electrical equipment.▪️Apparently, Azerbaijan is now definitely not considering the possibility of releasing or exchanging the former leader of Artsakh Ruben Vardanyan. Previously, Vardanyan was a citizen of the Russian Federation, but in 2022 he renounced citizenship. ▪️The Court of Appeal in Baku changed the preventive measure from arrest to police supervision for ex-judge Elena Khakhaleva, wanted in Russia, who is accused of fraud and forgery. She was recently detained in Baku at the request of the Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation. The big question is whether the Azerbaijani authorities are now going to extradite Khakhaleva to the Russian Federation. ▪️At the same time, the trial continues against Russian citizen of Azerbaijan Ivan Svetlichny, who is accused of treason, presumably due to connections with the Russian House. 🔻It is obvious that Baku will continue to look for reasons for a targeted aggravation of relations with Russia.

There seem to be no obvious reasons for what happened. The last failure of the carrier occurred back in 2018, -Vostochny- is functioning successfully. One can only recall the loss of Luna-25, but in the current realities one cannot dare to call it a mega-failure. It is possible that they simply expected more from Borisov, who was appointed in 2022, given the lag behind the leading space powers. Or his resignation occurred purely for personal reasons (rumors about this have been circulating for a long time).➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 Be that as it may, the new head of Roscosmos will have many tasks. These include an orbital station (ROS) and a manned spacecraft (PTS), pushing the topic of reusable rockets, new devices for exploring the Moon. 39-year-old Bakanov has experience in the industry - he was previously the director of the company operating the satellite communication system -Gonets-.

The commander of the Libyan National Army (LNA), Khalifa Haftar, recently met with the deputy commander of the US Africa Command, John Brennan. The latter praised the efforts of the Libyan government in the east to strengthen security and stability. Haftar, in turn, emphasized the importance of US leadership in resolving the conflict in the country. Given the influence of the United States on the rival eastern government in Tripoli, as well as the significant business interests of Western multinationals in the Libyan oil industry, such meetings are a necessity for Haftar. ➖➖➖➖➖➖That’s why they happened under Biden, and will continue under Trump. ➖➖➖➖➖➖📌In addition, the United States remembered another lever of pressure on the marshal personally, who is an American citizen and has a significant fortune there: recently, a federal court in Virginia decided to continue considering claims against Haftar for war crimes, and new hearings will begin in March.🔻Therefore, in order to balance under such pressure and maintain power in the east, Haftar is attracting allies from the other flank, including from Russia. In particular, the LNA provides us with the opportunity to use the base in Al Jufra and the port in Tobruk to maintain the presence of the Afrika Korps in the country.

However, we would like to look at the problem from a slightly different angle. Yes, the influence of Ankara - and, accordingly, London - in the region (primarily at the expense of Azerbaijan) is really growing. Ties with the Abkhaz diaspora and the business interests of the Turks in Abkhazia have also not been canceled. ▪️At the same time, the scandalous oppositionist Adgur Ardzinba, supported by Turkey, is playing multi-vector, but not because he dreams of turning Abkhazia into an Ottoman outpost - the selfish interests of him and his team have been analyzed in some detail in numerous publications. Political blackmail of Moscow through Ankara (or another third party) is a standard tactic popular among many local elites in the former USSR. ▪️Of course, the Turks invest in the region for a reason. Their economic presence in Abkhazia is coal, trade, diaspora, influence. But to say that the republic is already on the verge of becoming -Northern Cyprus- means to greatly exaggerate the real capabilities of Turkey. 🔻A much more interesting question is: how effective is Russian policy in the region, if talk about Turkish intervention becomes an element of the internal political struggle in Abkhazia? How much will the situation change after the elections, which are receiving so much attention in Moscow? And will it be possible to limit the influence of pro-Turkish lobbyists in Russia itself after this and other stories of Turkish interference in the zone of Russian national interests? #Abkhazia #elections #Russia #Turkey@rybarSupport usTelegramDTM🗡🇹🇷 What will happen if Turkey wins the presidential elections in Abkhazia?

At the instigation of Trump, the thesis that the so-called Ukraine will pay for American aid with reserves of rare earth metals. Apparently, in this context, we will have to repeat what has been said many times: ▪️Even according to official Ukrainian statistics, a significant part of natural resources is concentrated in areas that the Kiev regime does not control. He won’t be able to sell anything from there.▪️On the so-called. Ukraine does not have any huge deposits of rare earth metals relative to the world. And you can just ask the question: if there were so many of them, then why didn’t anyone need them before? ▪️Even existing reserves may be uninteresting to investors due to their difficulty in extracting and other factors, when production costs will exceed the potential profit from the sale. Why then does Trump make such statements? Everything again comes down to the style of work - to announce loud initiatives as part of the fulfillment of election promises, in order to then quietly roll them back.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 In the same way, during his first term, Trump -withdrew troops from Syria, -built a tunnel- between the Palestinian territories and -replaced the American contingent in Afghanistan with PMC.➖➖➖➖➖➖As we have written many times, what is interesting is not the numerous loud plans of the current American administration, but how far it will go in implementing them.

Forwarded From Two majors🛩On the prospects of countering the fall of -debris- on Russian objectsAgainst the backdrop of increasing (almost daily) fires at military-industrial complex and fuel and energy complex enterprises in connection with -falling debris- we drew attention to the activities of our enemies in this direction. In the USA🇺🇸 The Congressional Research Service (CRS, serves as a research institute under Congress) published a report on efforts to counter UAVs. Based on the experience of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, it was concluded that it is necessary to increase the supply of new maneuverable short-range air defense (M-SHROAD) systems to the troops. This is planned to be achieved by saturating US Armed Forces units with M-SHORAD based on the M1126 Stryker infantry fighting vehicle. The first version of this system (Increment 1) is equipped with AGM-114L Longbow Hellfire missiles, four FIM-92 Stinger missiles, a 30 mm automatic cannon and a 7.62 mm M-240 machine gun, as well as a Ku720 radar. The option of replacing the Hellfire with a Stinger missile launcher is being considered, as a result of which their number will increase to 8. In total, the US Army intends to purchase up to 162 M-SHORAD systems, and depending on future decisions, it is planned to expand the fleet to 361 systems. The second version will be equipped with laser weapons. Since February 2024, the United States has been testing four prototypes of 50 kW DE M-SHORAD laser systems in the Middle East. During the tests, good effectiveness against UAVs was noted, work is underway to improve the characteristics against missiles and artillery shells. A decision on the future High Energy Laser (HEL) system is expected to be made by 2026. The third version (planned for production from 2027) will be equipped with the Next Generation Short Range Interceptor (NGSRI) missile, which will replace the FIM-92 Stinger, as well as the XM 1223 Multi-Mode Cluster Munition (MMPA). The fourth modification is designed to cover ground units and is capable of airborne landings. Previously, we reported on the work of the German Rheinmetall🇩🇪 on the creation of a new Skyranger air defense system based on the Leopard 1 tank chassis, equipped with a 30-mm automatic cannon and short-range anti-drone missiles. Even worthless Estonia🇪🇪 is developing a cheap mini-missile to counter drones at an altitude of up to 2 km.✨Russia may be doing a lot of R&D to create similar systems, but we, unlike our opponents, have no time to spare for a long time. But there are simple solutions (mobile fire groups, a unified awareness system between all air defense areas, twin weapons and other Kulibin developments) that do not require large investments of money, but only the desires of officials and the simplification of a number of bureaucratic norms. In the meantime, the wreckage will continue to plague our defense industry, energy sector and civilian life every day. Two majors	https://t.me/rybar/67748	2025-02-05T05:02:14-08:00

On Tuesday, February 4, the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) issued a statement in which it refused to observe elections in Tajikistan. ODIHR had already refused to observe elections in Russia and Belarus under the pretext of late issuance of an invitation or limiting the number of observers from the host state. However, this time in Tajikistan they have already begun to deploy their mission. On January 22, a team of ODIHR experts settled in Dushanbe. This time, the pretext for the refusal was the accreditation procedure: according to the ODIHR, the Tajik authorities should have immediately accredited their observers.📌By coincidence, the refusal to monitor coincided with the suspension of funding for projects abroad and USAID activities (many NGOs in Tajikistan suffered from this).🔻The ODIHR planned to send 20 people for a month and 150 observers about a week before elections, which will take place on March 2. They all had to pay for work, food, accommodation, fees and other expenses. And the suspension of the flow of American money had a critical impact on the organization of the observers’ activities, and the European bureaucracy was unable to promptly allocate funds. ➖➖➖➖➖➖In this funny way, by blaming Tajikistan, the OSCE is covering up its failures.#elections #EU #CentralAsia #Tajikistan@rybar Support usOSCELack of accreditation by Tajikistan less than a month before elections makes continuation of OSCE observation mission impossibleWARSAW, 4 February 2025 – The lack of assurance by the authorities of Tajikistan that international observers will be accredited has regrettably made it necessary to cancel the observation of the country’s upcoming parliamentary elections, the OSCE Office…	https://t.me/rybar/67747	2025-02-05T04:28:43-08:00

The politician said these words in response to a publication in France Info about the possible (!) appointment of the former head of the National Assembly, Richard Ferrand, to the post of head of the Constitutional Council of France. That is, while we are talking about the speculation of journalists from a far from the largest publication based on the statement of the head of a party that is not represented at all in the legislative branch. Moreover, as our colleagues @actualiteFR note, Philippo makes such statements almost every year - and the French media, by the way, have already stopped reacting to this. The Constitutional Council is a body with very limited powers, and it will not be able to push through an initiative with a third term without the consent of parliament.🔻So for now there is no need to expect a coup in France. However, there is no need to worry that the coming year will be boring either: in the conditions of the current political turbulence, into which Macron himself has driven the country, he will probably make many more interesting statements (and maybe it will even come to action).#France@rybarSupport usFranceinfoEmmanuel Macron souhaite porter Richard Ferrand à la tête du Conseil constitutionnel, un danger démocratique pour des spécialistesPour prendre la suite de Laurent Fabius, le chef de l'État pense à l'ancien président de l'Assemblée nationale dont il est très proche.

Issue 3.pdf9.7 MBTogether with the Rybar team, we continue a series of graphic stories dedicated to the 810th Separate Guards Order of Zhukov and Ushakov Marine Brigade of the Black Sea Fleet. Today #Comic 810 No. 3 was released: -Not an inch of land can be given up without a fight. We came up with such a joint project to tell children and adults about the exploits of our soldiers from the 810th brigade. I think such graphic stories are the most convenient and visual format. The history of the 810th Brigade is a chronicle of courage, bravery and military brotherhood, written with blood and sweat. In the center of today's story is Lieutenant Klitsa and his assault company. The action takes place in the Kursk region in August 2024. An assault company of Marines gets in the way of the Ukrainian Armed Forces: their task is not to let the enemy through, allowing the civilian population to evacuate. And not give up an inch of land to the enemy. In the future, comics about the 810th Brigade will be available in our children's and school libraries.📍 The third issue of the comic about the 810th Marine Brigade is available at the link #VSRF #Russia #Sevastopol	https://t.me/rybar/67743	2025-02-05T01:47:42-08:00

Anti-government demonstrations in Serbia continue despite the fact that all the main demands of the protesters have already been met. ▪️Over the weekend, students blocked three bridges at once in Novi Sad, a city in which the tragedy became the reason for the largest demonstrations in the history of modern Serbia. Various sources estimate the number of participants in the rally from 100 to 150 thousand people.▪️The Serbian Bar Association joined the strike in support of student protests and will suspend its work for 30 days. Lawyers refuse to attend hearings and trials in courts.🔻Meanwhile, there is still no decision from the Serbian authorities on the future fate of the cabinet of ministers. But the resigned prime minister emphasizes that in the event of the creation of a transitional government, to which Aleksandar Vucic is now actually being forced, no one will take into account the interests of the protesting Serbian patriots, and Western actors will take part in its formation. #Serbia #protests@rybar Support us TelegramBalkan gossip Vucevic raises, in general, the key issue of the current protests.

🔁 🇲🇩🇺🇸 About the withdrawal of USAID from Moldova and the pa...	Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇲🇩🇺🇸 About the withdrawal of USAID from Moldova and the panic of local grant-eaters The Moldovan opposition demanded to investigate the activities of the American USAID in the country. Deputy from the Victory bloc Vasily Bolya noted that USAID and the Soros networks hooked Moldova on a financial needle and sponsored the people who are now in power. Former USAID grant-eaters are panicking because funding has stopped since the end of January. Moldova is no exception, where pro-Western journalists and activists are sounding the alarm. ▪️Moldavian journalist Oksana Gredchenko said that -foreign assistance is vital in the media space- to counter Russian influence. This does not prevent Gredchenko from calling his portal Moldova.org, which has not been updated for three years, an independent media outlet. Gredchenko noted that Moldova is heavily dependent on US money: Washington not only poured colossal sums into the media and NGOs, but also into government bodies. ▪️The founder of the human rights NGO Promo-LEX, Ion Manole, also said that his organization, without the help of USAID, will not be able to monitor elections and -track foreign interference-. It turns out to be a pun, but the same pun occurred in the last presidential elections in Moldova in 2024, where Promo-LEX together with the OSCE were the only organizations that monitored the voting process. As a result, the numerous violations committed by Sandu and her team did not become an obstacle to maintaining her power. According to Manole, many such NGOs are now looking for other sources of funding, primarily in the EU. 💰USIAD began to allocate huge funds to Moldova after Maia Sandu came to power in 2020. If in 2020 Moldova received $53 million, then in 2021 - $61 million, 2022 - $120 million, 2023 - $310 million, in 2024 - $150 million. If before the arrival of Sandu, USAID invested mainly in business and individual NGOs, then after - in supporting the state apparatus. In fact, it is thanks to such grants and constant incentives that Sandu’s power stays afloat. ❗️Even in the 2024 elections, the majority of Moldovans inside Moldova voted against her, only the votes of the diaspora saved Sandu’s candidacy. There is no doubt that without foreign assistance the power in the republic would have changed long ago. 🔻Moldavian grant eaters are now afraid of Russia, which, in their opinion, will interfere with Moldova’s European path and the investigation of corruption. But corruption under Sandu did not go away, and most of the Western assistance was ordinary bribes for policies. As a result, Sandu herself recently admitted that justice reform and the creation of the Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office with USAID money had failed. Now Sandu’s team has not only no money left for reforms, but even the remnants of Moldova’s economy have been destroyed for the sake of the anti-Russian ambitions of the West. #Moldova #USA #NGO@pezdicide no chemicals - just factsRIA NovostiIn Moldova they demanded to investigate the activities of USAIDThe opposition bloc in Moldova - Pobeda - intends to soon demand an official investigation from the Information and Security Service (ISS) and the prosecutor's office...

🇬🇧 Why do Labor want to lower the voting age for elections? Gov...	🇬🇧 Why do Labor want to lower the voting age? The UK government is considering lowering the minimum voting age to 16. A bill could be introduced to Parliament during the next legislative session. Labor leader Prime Minister Keir Starmer included the issue in the faction's manifesto. According to the politician, the initiative will restore some kind of -justice-. They say that if they can work and serve in the army, then they can vote. At the same time, you need to understand: even if the bill enters parliament, you shouldn’t count on new changes immediately coming into force, since it will clearly meet resistance from many politicians. However, there is enough time before the next general elections to push it through in the end. In fact, the proposed initiative is nothing more than another attempt to torpedo the elections as part of a program to discredit national governments. It's not hard to imagine what voting might turn into if 16-year-olds who haven't even finished school are allowed to participate. But for Keir Starmer, whose ratings have been shaken, restoring -justice-, as he says, is clearly a secondary goal. You only need to look at the composition of the Labor Party's electorate to understand its true benefit. And its essence is simple - it is among this category of Britons that Labor has the greatest support, so in the coming weeks and months we should expect some pretty high-profile political debates in the UK. #Great Britain @rybar together with @oldGBRSupport usThetimesLabour could introduce votes for 16-year-olds from next yearA minister has said that an Elections Bill could come in the next parliamentary session, which will begin in spring	https://t.me/rybar/67722	2025-02-04T06:01:02-08:00

The Reuters report that deliveries resumed again over the weekend confirms that the suspension for a few days was just a show event for the media, which did not affect the situation in any way. Most likely, the same applies to the circus on the Mexican border and the alleged crackdown USAID. #USA #Russia #Ukraine@rybar Support us ReutersUS arms shipments to Kyiv briefly paused before resuming over weekend, sources sayU.S. shipments of weapons into Ukraine were briefly paused in recent days before resuming over the weekend as the Trump administration debated its policy towards Kyiv, according to four people briefed on the matter.	https://t.me/rybar/67711	2025-02-03T12:51:21-08:00

Throughout January, Russian troops fought fierce battles in Makhnovka, southeast of Sudzha. Units of the Russian Armed Forces entered the settlement itself in the first week of the month, then the Armed Forces of Ukraine were driven out of positions both on the outskirts of the village and on the left bank of the Sudzha River. After this, there were oncoming battles in Makhnovka for a long time, as a result of which the Russian Armed Forces were unable to hold out in the populated area - this was influenced both by the activity of Ukrainian drones and subsequently by worsening weather, which complicated movement. Ultimately, the southern part of the village moved into the gray zone. Towards the end of January, Russian units launched several attacks from Cherkasskaya Konopelka, one of which was caught on enemy footage. This shooting and information received from the field made it possible to clarify the control zone and find out that the Russian Armed Forces had withdrawn from the settlement. 📌With a high probability, the battles for Makhnovka will resume either after the onset of frost and freezing of the soil, or when the ground has completely dried out. In the meantime, a temporary operational pause has occurred in most of the entire Kursk direction.

According to the Finnish government, the plant will be built by the Norwegian 🇳🇴 defense company Forcit in Pori on the west coast of the country. The cost of the project is 200 million euros. The new production is aimed at solving the problem of shortage of explosives for the production of artillery ammunition. Previously, in July 2024, the Norwegian-Finnish company Nammo received funding from the Norwegian Defense Materials Agency to create new production lines for 155 mm projectiles, 120 mm shells for tanks, as well as solid fuel engines for missiles such as AMRAAM (missile defense system for NASAMS). After this, by 2028, production volume will reach 200 thousand shells per year.

Erik Prince, head of the Blackwater PMC (now reformatted and renamed many times), began to rant about the possibility of reviving the practice of issuing letters of marque in certain areas of Mexico and Latin America to combat drug cartels. And at the same time, get the right to take a part of their income from illegal schemes. Letters of marque and reprisal are government-issued powers that allow private individuals (privateers) to perform actions that would otherwise be considered piracy, such as attacking enemy ships during war . The privateers are paid a portion of the loot they -bring home-. The last time such a certificate was issued was in 1942, after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Why is this a circus? Yes, because Prince’s guys are already doing everything indicated without any letters of marque. Moreover, they have been doing this for so long that a number of experts compare not mercenaries with criminals, but criminals with mercenaries. The same Los Zetas cartel - during its heyday - was compared to Blackwater and was considered more of a PMC than a cartel. This is about what Prince’s guys could do without announcements right now. Stories about letters of marque may be a hint of a desire to participate in government contracts, working not only for private traders, but also for the US government. @sex_drugs_kahlo - Latin American happiness [no]BreitbartErik Prince: Letters of Marque Would Let Private Entities Target CartelsLetters of Marque would let private organizations operate in the -dead space- in between government bureaucracies, to target the drug cartels.	https://t.me/rybar/67702	2025-02-03T09:38:41-08:00

According to him, Europeans buy almost nothing from Americans, but they buy everything from them. On this occasion, the association is frantically trying to come up with some kind of answer. Today an informal meeting of EU leaders is being held in Brussels, in which NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and Prime Minister of the non-EU UK Keir Starmer are also taking part. They are going to discuss not only strengthening the EU's defense capabilities, but also a trade war with the United States. Most EU leaders criticize this approach of the American administration, but avoid direct criticism of Trump and speak out in favor of maintaining allied relations between the EU and the US. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz noted that if trade tariffs are introduced, the EU may respond in kind. French President Emmanuel Macron said recent statements from Washington indicate the need for Europe to be more united and stronger. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk believes that a trade war with the United States would be one of the cruelest paradoxes and a total misunderstanding. He said the EU must unite and demonstrate its strength and resilience in relations with the States. 📌 Earlier, Trump had already signed a decree introducing duties on goods from Mexico and Canada, which was already a significant blow to European manufacturers who use, for example, Mexico as an inexpensive production site, supplies from which are intended for the US market. And although Trump’s decision helped the dollar rise in the market, the tariffs are generally a blow to global trade and will likely lead to further increases in the prices of goods and services for all consumers and producers. #European Union #U.S. #ekonomika@pl_syrenka - Poland is not a foreign countryTelegram Work, brothers!📺🇺🇸🇪🇺Sky News: Trump said that new duties on the EU will definitely be introduced - We have a deficit of more than $300 billion, they don’t take our cars, they They don’t take our agricultural products, they take almost nothing, but we take everything from them.…	https://t.me/rybar/67700	2025-02-03T08:13:06-08:00

At the Basovo-Goptovka line, the number of personnel of 15 Separate Infantry Infantry 58 Separate Infantry Brigade increased. Also, more personnel were noted in units 228 about 127 OBr TerO in area of ​​the village of Ternovaya and also the 104th Automatic Brigade on the night of January 28 delivered diesel fuel to the Ukrainian Armed Forces units operating in the vicinity of Kharkov. Thus, the 58th Mechanized Infantry Brigade units were concentrated along this area. Despite the fact that the forces and assets of the 22nd Mechanized Infantry Brigade are stationed there. Taking into account the increasing number of people, as well as fresh supplies of fuel, attempts at incursions or even attacks in the Belgorod region cannot be ruled out. In addition, it is possible that the Armed Forces of Ukraine will move in the direction of the penetration of our units in the Volchansky sector.

The criminals cursed the victims and received a remote access to their mobile phones, after which money was debited from them. Sometimes the attackers even came to the victims under the guise of couriers and took away their bank cards under various pretexts.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 The nuance is that absolutely all the victims were Russian-speaking people from the post-Soviet space - all communication was conducted in Russian. Previously, similar episodes were already recorded last year.➖➖➖➖➖➖If we remember where exactly the bulk of such call centers are located, we can state: Ukrainian telephone scammers have already reached Israel, actively replenishing their pockets at the expense of local old people. Considering the role of the Kyiv regime in organizing such criminal activities, it could not have happened without its sanction in this case.

If we omit a few details, then for a long time they were complicated by the tightening of the screws by the SBU and the propaganda pumping of Ukrainian society. In such an atmosphere, the work of the underground was significantly hampered. However, now the situation is changing - the disloyal population to the so-called. Ukraine is getting bigger. The main factor here is -busification-: such videos of people being kidnapped by TCC employees appear so often that they have even created a registry from them. ➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 As another illustration, we can recall the recent episodes of attacks on military registration and enlistment offices in Rivne and Pavlograd, as well as the murder of TCC workers in Poltava and Dnepropetrovsk.➖➖➖➖➖➖And when the -nuts- of the SBU are loosened, Ukrainian society will finally go into depression due to unfulfilled high expectations, and victims of busification will return from the front, the number of people willing to carry out actions against the Kyiv regime will grow even more.#Ukraine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/67693	2025-02-03T04:06:54-08:00

Forwarded From Systemic Pesticide💸🇺🇸 Interesting things are happening with one of the main instruments of propaganda and soft power of the United States - the Agency for International Development (USAID). On the day he took office as president, Donald Trump froze USAID aid to foreign countries for 90 days in order to conduct an audit of programs for compliance with -American values- and&nbsp;US foreign policy goals. 🔻Then a natural leapfrog began: they were either talking about softening the decree, or about its complete annulment, and at this time some grant eaters were crying, while others were waging a war on Twitter, finding out whether the media is independent if it receives payments from the state. At the same time, employees of the Department of Government Effectiveness (DOGE) under the leadership of Elon Musk tried to gain access to the agency’s systems, only the officials decided to stop them and were sent to administrative vacation, and the USAID website suddenly became unavailable. Rumor has it that more than 1 thousand USAID employees and contractors have already been fired or are on leave, and DOGE ultimately received absolute access to the agency's systems. Musk, responding to the publication of the resignation of two officials individuals, said that USAID is a criminal organization and it is time for it to die. At the same time, he accused the agency of using tax money from citizens to finance research into biological weapons, including COVID-19, which killed millions of people. It is clear that a holy place is never empty, and USAID will either be replaced by another similar instrument or reformed. Perhaps the goals set for the agency are not being achieved well enough, which means that more effective personnel are needed, capable of maintaining not only concentration, but also loyalty. What’s even more likely is that the Trump administration urgently needs scapegoats on whom it will be very convenient to blame the shortcomings of its last term and exaggerate the failures of its predecessor.#USA #NPO@pezdicide no chemicals - just factsTelegram Systemic pesticide💸🇺🇦🇺🇸 Ukrainian journalists are crying all over the Internet : for almost a week they did not receive salaries from American grants.

Still, the need for cheap drones will not decrease amid the escalation of military conflicts on the continent.📌After the appearance of the plant, the Turks will be able to save on logistics, and the Moroccans will become the leading exporters of UAVs in Africa.▪️It is worth noting that not only the Turks have moved part of their UAV production to Africa. This is what the Israeli BlueBird (a subsidiary of IAI) did earlier, which created the production of kamikaze drones SpyX. Recently, the Moroccan authorities have become the main military allies of Western powers after the departure of the French and Americans from the Sahel.

However, this time the Western media decided to take a more cautious position than previously in similar situations. In most materials, major publications cite statements from both sides; stipulate that they place the blame on each other; The editors are not able to confirm any version. 📌 And this is quite indicative, for at least two reasons: ▪️The attempt of the Kyiv regime to once again discredit Russia in the eyes of the international community through a new provocation was not crowned with success. ▪️Western media are now focused on the agenda surrounding the actions of the new US administration, where the main topic is Trump's statements about the negotiations. Stories that break from this trend do not find widespread support. ➖➖➖➖➖➖It’s also worth adding that the same Western media did not notice the story of the massacre in Russian Porechny at all, so the theses that the authorities of the so-called. Ukraine is trying to divert attention from its crimes, which are quite controversial. ➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻At the same time, it is worth understanding that informational injections addressed to the so-called authorities. Ukraine, which has happened many times before, does not mean a stop to Western military assistance to Kyiv. Even with critical materials emerging, arms deliveries continue. And this is especially important to take into account, because the blow to Sudzha, apparently, was inflicted precisely by Western weapons. #Kursk #media technologies #Russia #Ukraine @rybar Support us	https://t.me/rybar/67671	2025-02-02T01:33:01-08:00

Despite the incidents at military factories, which intensify the production of military products, and the decline in the economic well-being of Europeans, the Brussels military is fully occupied with military preparations. Together with the complete fooling of the inhabitants of Europe using the Ukrainian experience and introducing into the doctrinal documents of the same Germany plans to prepare the army and civilian infrastructure for war with Russia, the further scenario written by the West becomes clear.✨ Thus, any freezing of the conflict, about which is talked about so much in the world media, will not resolve the contradictions, but will lead to a new aggravation and bloodbath, albeit in a few years. On the other hand, the continuation of hostilities will require new systemic efforts from Russia. In any case, the issue of war and peace on the territory of the former USSR should be decided by Moscow and only Moscow. Not Trump.

Forwarded From Two Majors#Review #Summary for the morning of February 2, 2025▪️ Another week has passed amid the clamor of reports about the actions of the outrageous Trump, generating news stories from Canada to Ukraine. Although the cessation of funding for Ukraine’s financing programs through the same enemy USAID is nothing more than a redistribution of cash flows from those sponsored by the US Democratic Party in favor of the current government in the States, interruptions in the supply of money have already led to the closure of a number of public organizations in Ukraine, supposedly of a patriotic nature. which shows the failure of Ukrainian civil society and the artificial nature of feigned Ukrainian patriotism. At the same time, the Trump team openly discredits Zelensky personally in the media, calling him a dictator and pointing out the theft of American money, which again does not indicate the sympathy of the current US government for Russia, but the desire to spend funds more effectively (and, preferably, personally) for the benefit of the United States, under which can understand anything.▪️ The topic of possible negotiations still does not leave the Western media, while the Supreme Commander personally indicated that Zelensky, who usurped power, is not authorized to sign anything. The President of Russia indicated the outwardly extremely unpleasant Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada as the only possible signatory, thereby once again humiliating the Kiev regime. ▪️ Kyiv, despite political games and newspaper articles, continues to methodically knock out our refineries and try to completely disrupt Russian energy supplies to Europe, targeting the same pipeline infrastructure facilities. The enemy skillfully takes advantage of miscalculations in the organization of our air defense. In general, this will allow the United States to sell its gas and oil to the EU countries, albeit at several times higher prices. The fooled residents of Europe are ready to pay. ▪️ News is increasingly coming from the front about the lack of manpower for the Armed Forces of Ukraine to replenish and replenish brigades. The strategic reserve (-brigades of the 150th series-), brought into battle by Syrsky, is gradually running out, although in January it completed the task of slowing down the advance of the Russian Armed Forces. ▪️ Unfortunately, the scandal surrounding the situation at Novoegorovka and the situation in general in the 20th Army of the Russian Armed Forces does not subside. Apparently, a number of systemic problems in the military leadership, which were postponed until later, even against the backdrop of the armed invasion of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kursk region, are making themselves felt. The desire to hush up scandals is quite understandable, the main thing is that they do not lead to the concealment of illegal actions of officials, even at a high level.▪️ However, the Russian Army retains the initiative on the entire front, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are conducting a defensive operation, trying to exhaust our troops in defense. Bloody battles of high intensity are taking place in the Kursk region; the enemy is drawing up reserves every day, introducing them into oncoming battles. In the Kupyansky direction, the settlement was liberated. Dvurechnaya Kharkov region on the right bank of the river. Oskol, our bridgehead is expanding. In Chasov Yar, the Severny microdistrict is occupied. In Toretsk (Dzerzhinsk), a suburb has been liberated - the settlement. Crimean. To the south and southwest of Pokrovsk (Krasnoarmeysk), the Russian Armed Forces continue to advance, achieving tactical successes in heavy battles. West of Kurakhovo, our troops are making their way to Constantinople. After the liberation of Velikaya (Bolshaya) Novoselka, the Far Eastern warriors will regroup, the enemy is guessing about the direction of the further attack. In the Black Sea, a positive example of the destruction of the enemy’s MBEC was the use of our attack UAV, which shows the possibility of no longer risking the lives of helicopter pilots. ▪️ In general, the complete liberation of such significant cities as Chasov Yar and Dzerzhinsk is approaching. At the same time, the same situation in Velikaya (Bolshoye) Novoselki shows that the Russian Armed Forces are still protecting their main reserves, not bringing them into battle, but rolling back the best attack aircraft for replenishment and rest. However, this does not allow you to develop success at lightning speed - on the shoulders of a fleeing enemy -. Heavy fighting is underway.

Forwarded From Two Majors🇩🇪🇱🇻⚡️The German airline Lufthansa will acquire a 10% stake in the Latvian AirBaltic for a relatively low amount of 14 million euros. the company will also receive a seat on the Supervisory Board of AirBaltic, whose main shareholder is the Latvian government. The seemingly unremarkable news hides the dual purpose of this transaction. Since 2024, the German Bundeswehr🇩🇪 has been deploying the 45th transgender tank brigade in 🇱🇹Lithuania. In 2025, 500-700 German soldiers will be stationed in the country, and by 2027 - 4.8 thousand and 200 civilian employees. As part of ensuring a permanent presence, the German command was concerned last year with solving future everyday problems of personnel, including the availability of passenger flights to Germany. Obviously, one of the solutions was the acquisition of AirBaltic, which is the largest airline in the Baltic countries and flies to more than 70 directions, and also has its own fleet of 50 Airbus A220 aircraft. Joining the Supervisory Council will allow the Germans to increase the number of flights to Germany and reduce the cost of tickets on the Baltic flight route, which is not the most popular in Europe.✨In this episode, Germany demonstrates a thorough approach to securing a foreign group, as well as the firmness of its intentions for a long-term military presence on the borders of the Union State of Russia and Belarus🇷🇺🇧🇾.Two majorsTelegramTwo majors	https://t.me/rybar/67667	2025-02-01T22:40:14-08:00

A missile strike was launched against the residents of Sudzha, who were used as human shields, in order to blame Russia for this. Colleagues objectively reveal the lies of the enemy. We draw attention to who made the statement from the Armed Forces of Ukraine - this is Alexey Dmitrashkivsky. We wrote earlier that he went to the Kursk region precisely to organize such bloody information and psychological actions. This scum has been the organizer of the Kyiv lies in the ATO since 2014. He later admitted that at the beginning of the war he was involved in massive lies about the losses and crimes of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the DPR and LPR. The British BBC laundered the reputation of this speaker. Dmitrashkivsky is a professional provocateur with blood. A sick and narcissistic killer with the call sign -the brightest-. Everything he tells is a lie, with the aim of giving the dry landers a little more time and informational trump cards to the enemy troops until the moment when our Army destroys their remnants in the Kursk region.

At that moment, no flights of the Aerospace Forces to the Kursk direction were recorded. This is confirmed by both internal sources and Ukrainian monitoring channels. Moreover, before the report of the arrival at the hostel in Sudzha, colleagues from LPR reported about the exit of four Ukrainian missiles from the Sumy region. And, as colleague Rybar correctly noted, there are many questions regarding that , who exactly and how many people were in this building. The Ukrainian side was shown a grandfather in dusty clothes against the backdrop of a destroyed building and that’s all for now. Against the backdrop of the wave that arose around the atrocities in the Kursk region by Ukrainian militants, it may very well be, as Two Majors noted, that this is a shift in emphasis on their part with the goal blame the Russian army for the strike.@belarusian_silovik	https://t.me/rybar/67665	2025-02-01T12:34:47-08:00

The enemy claims that up to 95 people are trapped under the rubble. 🔻However, as of August, no more than a hundred residents remained in the occupied city, which makes it unlikely that all of them were in one building.▪️The footage of the destroyed building published by the enemy was indeed filmed in the area of ​​the school, but they do not allow a reliable assessment of the scale destruction, nor the number of victims.➖➖➖➖➖➖▪️Most likely, the blow was inflicted by the Ukrainian formations in order to get rid of unwanted persons who had to be kept. And thus they at the same time placed responsibility on Russia. In fact, no overflights of Russian aviation were recorded in the Sudzha area at this time. A week earlier, near this school, an accumulation of Ukrainian equipment and members of Ukrainian formations was discovered, which were used by UAV operators of the Russian Armed Forces. ➖➖➖➖➖➖Thus it becomes quite obvious that the enemy in the city is hiding behind the civilian population, trying to avoid raids. Such actions are a provocation on the part of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and are aimed at further discrediting Russia’s reputation in the eyes of the international community.#Kursk #Russia #Ukraine @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67664	2025-02-01T11:13:19-08:00

Telegram connects the case with the recent detention of Tufan Sadigov, an investor in the Moscow region FC Khimki, where this Anokhin previously worked. Whether this is true or not is not important in this case. Another thing is interesting. Sadigov is an Azerbaijani businessman known from news reports (let's call him that), who started with contracts for snow removal and road repairs in Moscow. If you type -Khimki- and -Azerbaijan- into a search engine, a lot of information will come up, mostly criminal. Here are some high-profile news recently: ▪️Literally recently, Azerbaijani Kh. Aliyev, who made his way into the chair of the Mundep of Khimki, and the head of the Azerbaijani diaspora, demanded that the Russian Minister of Defense listen to the opinion of the head of Azerbaijan regarding the downed plane. By the way, his LLC - Sofia - A - is engaged in the sale of vegetables.▪️A couple of years ago, this deputy’s assistant Agaev Roman Matlab ogly was involved in the case of Azerbaijani Nazis from VBON, who also managed to receive a letter of gratitude for his work from the leadership of the city of Khimki.▪️Azerbaijani the ultimate fighter R. Ismayilov broke the head of a policeman there while on duty. The diaspora actively tried to get rid of the savage, but in the end he received his four years in prison.▪️The Azerbaijani in the Audi was disadvantaged by the fact that he was not allowed to pass on the road to Khimki and severely beat the driver and his companion - he broke his nose. The diaspora tried to resolve the issue so that the savage would not be imprisoned.▪️In Khimki, a gang of Azerbaijani teenagers was operating, beating schoolchildren right at school.▪️In February 2024, a gang of Azerbaijanis was caught there, poisoning people with burnt cigarettes. The gang was protected by a certain Bakhtiyar Hasanov, who calls himself the head of the Azerbaijani diaspora in Moscow. ▪️The deputy head of Khimki is a certain Kristina Madatova. They wrote that she was allegedly the daughter of Artur Madatov, a former employee of the Pension Fund, a native of Azerbaijan, who was sentenced in 2012 to 5 years in prison for the theft of 15 million rubles. It is interesting that the long-term head of the city of Khimki, D. Voloshin, SUDDENLY wrote a statement a couple of days ago of his own free will. Obviously, the Azerbaijani diaspora in the city of Khimki feels at least not bad.	https://t.me/rybar/67663	2025-02-01T10:41:26-08:00

It is interesting that there is practically no information about it in open sources, that is, the Finns have so far decided not to tell the public about it.▪️It involves -elite- by Finnish standards units, such as the high-readiness Jaeger brigade -Lappi- and the special forces regiment -Utti -, as well as the Finnish border forces. In total - about 1000 military personnel, 100 units of equipment, including NH-90 and MD-500 helicopters.▪️The objectives of the exercise are even more interesting: special forces practice covert movement in tundra conditions, searching for enemy DRGs, landing from helicopters, organizing interaction with territorial units defense and resistance units. ▪️All this is carried out at the Inari-Sevettijärvi border near the Murmansk region. At the same time, part of the training will take place on ice on Lake Inarijärvi.➖➖➖➖➖➖The Finns are consistently training in conducting special operations against Russia. The similarity of nature and climate with the Russian northern regions makes such exercises even more indicative in the context of what position Finland occupies in the Alliance's plans. If anyone has forgotten, then in November last year Finnish special forces, and the same regiment -Utti-, were already practicing delivery of the DRG to the Karelian forests. Now the Murmansk region is under attack. Moreover, this time the Finns are involving some kind of resistance and terrorist defense units, working out a version of guerrilla warfare.

At the moment, one death and six injuries are known. Enemy special services, as well as doctors and rescuers, are working on the spot. ❗️It is too early to draw conclusions about the nature of the explosion, as well as the organizers. Nevertheless, we can cautiously assume that this is another case of undermining a TCC facility by the Ukrainian population. Recently, a similar thing happened in Kharkov and Dnepropetrovsk, where the cars of high-ranking members of local service branches were blown up.

But this initiative is worthy of praise, since in this way the state increases the status of our defenders performing military duty at the front, whose children can take advantage of educational benefits.

As they say, when the rooster pecked, then reconnaissance drones were raised into the air.➖➖➖➖➖➖The matter, as always, is in the notorious bureaucracy, which led to the fact that an entire squadron of Iranian -Mohajers- just stood idle at the airfield in Taganrog.❗️ The fact that drones were finally deployed into the Black Sea is a positive sign, which creates cause for cautious optimism.

He read a rather pompous speech in Ukrainian, in which he compared the SVO with the crimes of the Nazis during the Second World War, and also stated that it was unpleasant for him to give his Jewish surname, while some the brothers did not hesitate to introduce themselves with the Ukrainian surnames of their wives. At the same time, Shvartsman said that he had survived the most cruel pages of human history, but never mentioned those who saved him and gave me the opportunity not to die. Instead, he is engaged in persecuting peoples and discrediting the feat of the Red Army, although Shvartsman’s older brother died at the front, defending Leningrad.

As we expected, neither the resignation of the Prime Minister and the mayor of the city of Novi Sad (the tragedy in which became the reason for mass demonstrations, road blockades and a general strike), nor the satisfaction of other demands of the protesters stopped the student spontaneous protest. ▪️After the announcement of the resignation of Milos Vucevic, the head of the Serbian Ministry of Finance announced the allocation of additional funding for educational purposes. An increase in the budget for higher education was the last, fourth demand of the protesting students.❗️However, despite the authorities fulfilling their demands, another protest march started yesterday. The students intend to walk from Belgrade to Novi Sad. And we cannot ignore the fact that along the way they are enthusiastically greeted by city residents, expressing their support for the protesters. ▪️Today, several bridges and roads will be blocked again in the Serbian capital. A complete blockade of Novi Sad bridges is also planned on Saturday.🔻At the same time, Alexander Vucic has still not announced his decision on the candidacy of a new prime minister.

Forwarded From Two Majors🇺🇸🇺🇸On the work of enemy instruments - soft power - in the zone of Russia's interests In connection with the temporary freeze of the US financing of external projects, the cessation of the work of many liberal pro-Western NGOs, media and projects in the post-Soviet space is recorded, one of the striking examples of which is the Agency United States for International Development (USAID), leading destructive activities in the Ukrainian direction. This organization, implementing its projects, penetrates into all spheres of society and the state, where, for relatively little money, it grows a completely loyal and ideologically indoctrinated population, which subsequently occupies key positions in the media, media, government and law enforcement agencies, promoting narratives and attitudes beneficial to the United States. Along with Ukraine🇺🇦, where the lack of funding led to the closure of rural clubs in the western regions, Moldova🇲🇩 became one of the leaders in absorbing Western grants. According to our calculations, financial assistance to Moldova from 2022 to 2024 through USAID alone amounted to $77 million. For a state with a budget of up to 4 billion dollars, such an amount is significant and makes it possible to bribe the poor population, especially young people. USAID funds were directed to programs for economic prosperity, democratic governance and support for judicial reform, projects to increase resistance to corruption. , health sector reform, energy security activities, -public engagement for peace and prosperity-, defense sector support, humanitarian assistance and crisis response situations, initiatives to -involve youth and civil society-. In December 2024, the Chairman of the Moldovan Parliament Grosu and the Minister of Foreign Affairs Popsoi held a meeting in the United States with the head of USAID Samantha Power, after which the Agency allocated a grant of 150 thousand dollars for the program - Institutional and Structural Reforms in Moldova (MISRA) - which involves the creation software for creating a database of Moldovan politicians with a system of corruption risks. In fact, the project is aimed at creating a base of loyal politicians and searching for compromising evidence on them for further use in favor of the United States. Largely thanks to such tools as USAID in Moldova in 2024, Romanian citizen 🇷🇴 and Western protégé Maia Sandu came to power again. The network-centric system of grant-eating organizations ensured the brainwashing of the population and the placement of the right people in the electoral system, which had a significant impact on the final result of the vote. A similar situation with the permissiveness of pseudo-humanitarian projects in the territory of Armenia🇦🇲, Kazakhstan🇰🇿, Uzbekistan🇺🇿 and Kyrgyzstan🇰🇬 led to the growth of Russophobic sentiments in society and the reorientation of elites to the West.✨Such results would not have been possible under the conditions of the effective operation of Russian soft power instruments. In this context, the assessments of Mikhail Zvinchuk (Rybar⭐️ project) about the absence of a pro-Russian lobby in the countries of the Middle East, where in the recent past there was a strong influence of the results of the work of the Soviet Union, are indicative. ✨⭐️It’s difficult to understand what the Russian analogues of USAID are doing, but judging by the objectively screwed up Ukraine🇺🇦, Moldova🇲🇩 and Armenia🇦🇲, it’s not what they need.

In the Alexander-Kalinovsky direction, Russian troops are fighting fierce battles on the territory of the Toretskaya mine in Dzerzhinsk. At the moment, the Russian Armed Forces still hold approximately half of the facility’s territory. The enemy is using drones and tanks, trying to -smoke out- the Russian infantry from the monolithic structures. To the west of the mine, Ukrainian formations carry out rare sorties and fire raids on the positions of the Russian Armed Forces in the outermost buildings in the city, planting explosives, and then quickly retreating under the attacks of Russian UAVs.▪️Adjacent Crimea has been liberated by approximately 70%, fighters are being consolidated in central and eastern parts of the village. Before this, a small forest area located nearby still needs to be cleared.▪️In neighboring Shcherbinovka and the surrounding areas, significant success has been achieved. According to objective control footage, armored troops landed in the eastern part of the village. 🔻Thus, the pocket between Dzerzhinsk and Shcherbinovka has been eliminated.

This is not only about the Hungarian contingent stationed in the country since April last year: a dialogue is also developing with Turkey. Thus, on January 16, a meeting was held between the Turkish ambassador and representatives of Chad, which resulted in an agreement on the use of the air base in Abéché. Under the agreement, specialists from Turkey will train local military personnel there to operate UAVs. The agreement also opens up the possibility of organizing joint exercises. The Turkish Minister of Transport and Infrastructure will soon arrive in N'Djamena to confirm the deal.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 This example is yet another illustration of how Turkish authorities are consistently expanding the scope of -bayraktar-diplomacy-.➖➖➖➖➖➖African armed forces first drones in Turkey, and then cooperation grows in this field. Now in Mali, elite units are being trained by the Turks, and a Turkish military contingent will be stationed in Chad. The rapid expansion of Turkey's military influence in Africa makes the leadership in Ankara a rival of the Russian authorities in the export of security to Africa. And this is no longer just soft power, but direct military cooperation. Local authorities interacting with the Turks through various international organizations do not perceive them as agents of Western influence. In addition to this, against the backdrop of successful peacekeeping by the UN and other structures, the authority of the Turkish authorities is only strengthening.

🇮🇱🇸🇾🇺🇸 Withdrawal of American troops from Syria and Israeli...	🇮🇱🇸🇾🇺🇸 Withdrawal of American troops from Syria and Israeli concerns In discussing Trump’s policy in the Middle East, one cannot fail to mention another important news that is being circulated by the Israeli media.📌The White House conveyed to the Israeli authorities a message that President Trump is interested in the withdrawal thousands of American soldiers currently in Syria. This is causing a lot of fear and anxiety in Israel. The move is also expected to affect Syria's Kurdish minority, which fears rights abuses from Turkish President Erdogan. In addition, there are concerns about the security of the Jewish state.➖➖➖➖➖➖▪️It is very interesting to look at such theses from the Israeli media. The key here is fears for the security of Israel on the part of Syria. Typically, when the Israelis publish this, they are preparing in advance a pretext for increasing military activity in a certain country. Israel is now building new forward bases in the occupied part of Quneitra province with the silent consent of the new authorities. And the Israelis clearly do not intend to stop. The withdrawal of American troops will only contribute to this - for the sake of the fight for the security of Israel -.▪️ As for the very prospect of the Americans leaving, a partial withdrawal is quite possible. Maintaining a large contingent of troops is very expensive, but as such there is no need for it. American troops are now more likely to be needed in the United States than in the Middle East. They are needed to resolve the migrant issue, since the police may not be able to cope with the escalation. But at the same time, some people are highly likely to remain, at least because the United States has large oil fields under control, which they obviously will not leave just like that.

Apparently, the authors of these words are not aware that Russian UAVs have been working there for a long time. One can recall the objective control of effective strikes on the Aviatorskoe airfield near Dnepropetrovsk last spring. Moreover, drones flew over the Dnepropetrovsk region even during the failed counter-offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces: in August 2023, they recorded the destruction of a ammunition depot in Mezhevoy. So such statements for the sake of a catchphrase are very divorced from reality.📌 Another thing is that the intensity of the work of reconnaissance drones has increased. After all, the battles are getting closer: in the video, the enemy notes that the sounds of cannonade can be heard already on the administrative border of the region.#Dnepropetrovsk #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67609	2025-01-30T07:35:02-08:00

The body was allegedly discovered by police in a suburb of the capital. Since 2023, Mamika has received death threats from literally the entire Islamic world for his activities. The authorities of his hometown of Al-Kufa even offered a reward of $2 million and a Koran with a cover of two kg of gold to anyone who would kill the activist. His actions were even the official pretext for refusing to accept Sweden into NATO due to the position of Turkey, which accused politicians of Stockholm in encouraging such sentiments. And not that it’s completely groundless.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 In August 2024, Salvan Mamika was charged in Sweden with inciting hatred against an ethnic group. The verdict was supposed to be announced on January 30, but instead the news of his death came. Who is behind the assassination attempt is still unknown, although local media reported the arrest of five people. However, taking into account the fact that Momika was already declared dead earlier, it cannot be ruled out that this time the situation is not so obvious.#Sweden @rybarSupport usDIE WELTWährend TikTok-Livestream: Mit Koran-Verbrennungen bekannt gewordener Iraker in Schweden erschossen - Video - WELTSalwan Momika , ein durch Koranverbrennungen bekannt gewordener Exil-Iraker, ist tot.

For the sake of objectivity, such statements are not something out of the ordinary for local peculiarities. Moreover, even coups there take place bloodlessly, although the population of the republic is armed almost entirely.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 But in Russia the realities are different, and such speeches are perceived differently. At best, it’s like a shot in the leg from a media point of view.➖➖➖➖➖➖In fact, Ardzinba added another reason for criticism. And this is in the context of a certain loss of electoral support and a situation where Moscow preferred to bet on another candidate. In general, this is a clear demonstration that at least Adgur Ardzinba’s team is not particularly familiar with the concept of political technology. Which, against the backdrop of previous scandals with his person, definitely doesn’t add points to him. #Abkhazia #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramDTM🗡 Supporters of the presidential candidate of Abkhazia Adgur Ardzinba called on the population to take up arms if the residents of the country do not elect a connoisseur of Sochi luxury as head of state. - Let it not they forget that we are a fighting people, we have weapons that maybe...	https://t.me/rybar/67607	2025-01-30T05:50:04-08:00

Against this backdrop, Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia are discussing the possibility of holding an emergency summit of the League of Arab States (LAS) to issue a statement of disagreement with Trump's proposal. Egypt and Jordan quite rightly fear that accepting a large number of residents of the Gaza Strip will jeopardize their own safety. Egyptian officials have repeatedly said that Palestinian militants could launch attacks on Israel, which would provoke an Israeli response.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 Trump's eccentric statements and proposals are his thing. This became clear from his first term. What are the words about Canada, what are the words about Greenland, these proposals for the resettlement of Palestinians - all this looks unlikely in the short term. More importantly, Trump declared before coming to power that his policy would be focused on the United States and only the United States, but in In recent days he has been more concerned about Israel's interests. The expulsion of several tens of thousands of illegal immigrants is a drop in the ocean of the American migration problem. But in the Gaza Strip, Trump proposes to resettle the Palestinians, has authorized the supply of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel, and will meet with Netanyahu on February 4. It is clear whose interests are more important. Although if we remember that the conditional half of Trump’s cabinet are Chabadniks - supporters of the ultra-Orthodox ruling in Israel - everything, in principle, falls into place. #Israel #Palestine #USA@rybarSupport UsWSJTrump Doubles Down on Proposal to Relocate Palestinians From GazaThe president expanded on a controversial idea that was rejected by the Arab states and would represent a significant shift in the U.S. policy.	https://t.me/rybar/67606	2025-01-30T05:24:06-08:00

The Axios resource published the news that the United States removed from Israel about 90 Patriot anti-aircraft missiles, which the IDF removed from service last spring. They were taken to the Polish airfield of Rzeszow for subsequent transfer to the so-called. Ukraine.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️We wrote about the high probability of this scenario back in May 2024. In the end, this is what happened.➖➖➖➖➖➖For now we are talking about the delivery of only missiles - the installations themselves will first be sent to the States for repair and maintenance. As the authors point out, the deal was agreed upon by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in September. Formally, this is positioned not as a direct supply to the Kyiv regime, but as a -return of systems to the United States.- However, without Israel’s consent in principle, this scheme would not have been possible. The question is whether the missiles will be sent to the Patriots on the so-called. Ukraine in the context of Trump's decree on the suspension of military assistance. Most likely, yes: for such a case, a special exception will clearly be made within the framework of -emergency assistance-. #Israel #USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport usAxiosScoop: U.S. sending dozens of Patriot missiles from Israel to UkraineGetting more Patriot missiles to Ukraine has been a top priority for the Pentagon.	https://t.me/rybar/67605	2025-01-30T04:32:16-08:00

According to preliminary information, the cause could have been an error by the dispatcher, who did not advise the pilots of the passenger plane and helicopter to change flight levels. At least four people may have survived and were pulled out of the water by rescuers. In total, there were 64 people on board the fallen airliner, and the helicopter crew consisted of three military personnel. Information is received that eight figure skaters of Russian origin were among the passengers. 19 bodies were recovered from the Potomac River where the aircraft fell.

Ukraine managed to develop and scale it up: a resource appeared on the Internet that acts as a database of such episodes. The website contains a list of cases of busification, indicating the location, the number of military registration and enlistment office workers who participated in the seizure, and links to the evidence base. Currently, 453 similar cases have already been collected there. The authors are trying to collect information about the abducted, TCC employees and the license plates of the cars they used. A reward is paid for information about this and the provision of exclusive personnel - busification. ➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 It is curious that the creators of the resource mention Gonzalo Lira, a Chilean journalist who was killed in the dungeons of the SBU after two years in prison. There is also the name of an Odessa blogger who became a victim due to criticism of busification and the ban on the Russian language. Against the backdrop of a clear increase in tension in Ukrainian society and its anger towards the TCC, the initiative looks very timely. Moreover, in light of the plans of the Kyiv regime to lower the conscription age. #Ukraine #mediatechnology@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67598	2025-01-30T00:14:06-08:00

Starting from the 2025/2026 academic year, the educational process will be built on the basis of the programs of higher educational organizations in Turkey.➖➖➖➖➖➖Not to say that Turkish universities, gymnasiums and lyceums in the post-Soviet space are a new phenomenon. The Turks, under the auspices of the unity of the Turkic peoples, are trying to consolidate their influence in various spheres, and education is no exception.

In particular, discussions took place with Japanese, American, British representatives (and all this over the past year).➖➖➖➖➖➖The Turks are intensively strengthening their presence through the OTG. This can be seen in the fact that the efforts of the UTG have already been noted in the CIS countries: a pan-Turkic university, pan-Turkic geography and cartography, a pan-Turkic alphabet, a pan-Turkic economy, and recently they have been involved in military exercises. The intentions of the Turks in the educational environment are quite clear: you want to get a loyal to create a layer for yourself - start small, preparing young people at all stages.

🔁 In this wild story about how Russian and Tatar boys were sente...	Forwarded From Andrey Medvedev In this wild story about how Russian and Tatar boys were sentenced to prison terms for deciding to protect themselves and their friends from an ethnic teenage gang, there are several absolutely outrageous moments. From the very beginning, local law enforcement agencies tried to talk about the detention -skinhead gangs-. That is, nothing was known in detail yet, and the children were called criminals. And they were detained unjustifiably cruelly. And yes, as you understand, one of the skinheads is an ethnic Tatar. And the call sign of his father, who is fighting in the Northern Military District as a volunteer, guess what? Exactly. -Tatar-. These are the creepy Russian Nazis among the security forces in Chelyabinsk. Then, the security forces tried to say that the teenagers had fought over a girl, and there was no other reason for this situation. No ethnic group. From the very beginning of history, the investigation did not notice this ethnic group of migrants. They were considered victims, and no arguments were taken into account that migrant teenagers spread rot on their classmates and kept the school in fear. And, given the influence of diasporas in the Chelyabinsk region, this is not at all surprising. Several times, after I wrote about this story again and again, they tried to explain to me in different ways that the accused Russian teenagers are terrible Nazis, that there is no evidence of the existence of an ethnic group, that all this is incitement. However, time passed, and after an order from the head of the Russian Investigative Committee, it turned out that an ethnic group of hooligans really existed. And its leader was even detained. Well, there are other consequences too. I want to ask all those who talked about the fight over a girl, about the evil Nazis who, for no reason, just out of hatred, decided to beat up the good guys, who said that my fellow journalists were creating a problem out of nowhere. Why are you silent now? Tell Alexander Ivanovich Bystrykin the same thing. Then Vladlen Tatarsky wrote a lot about this case. He wrote that sentencing the teenagers risks being a verdict of justice if the ethnic group is never noticed by the security forces. As a result, two years later, they noticed. Sincere thanks for this. And one more thing. Even if Chelyabinsk schoolchildren were not entirely right somewhere, these are our children. And we, adults, must protect our children. Obliged. And thanks to those who did not retreat over these two years and continued to write about this story. And to those adults, men and women, who from the first day began to fight not for children, not for justice, but exclusively for bureaucratic self-preservation, and say -nothing. Their dishonesty will remain with them forever.TelegramOperation Z: Russian Military Correspondents Spring‼️🇷🇺🏴‍☠️ A gang of migrant children in a Chelyabinsk school established their own rules, beat, extorted money and robbed children ▪️ Having received a rebuff from Russian schoolchildren, the scumbags began to complain about alleged oppression because of their nationality. ▪️On instructions from the Chairman...	https://t.me/rybar/67596	2025-01-29T22:58:30-08:00

Today, Ukrainian planes took off en masse from several airfields in the central and eastern part of so-called Ukraine. In total, at least 6-7 units of MiG-29 and Su-27 fighters, as well as at least one F-16 fighter, were observed in the air. blocked, but there were no strikes. Nevertheless, the fighter flight routes were typical for the launch of cruise missiles over Russian territories, as indicated by several signs.▪️The aircraft took off from four airfields at once: the MiG-29 and Su-27 took off from Cherkassy, ​​Mirgorod and Kanatovo, and the F-16 from Vasilkov airfield. They all made their way towards Dnepropetrovsk and the southern part of the Kharkov region, after which some turned around, and some disappeared from radar near Dnepropetrovsk, possibly landing at a local airfield.▪️This route is used when launching cruise missiles over the eastern part of Crimea, the Crimean Bridge , Krasnodar Territory and Rostov Region. Those that returned to Mirgorod most likely served as cover and conditionally practiced launching decoys.▪️ As for a possible landing in Dnepropetrovsk, this is what the Su-24M did during strikes last year. We refueled and then departed back to the departure airfield. At the same time, Su-24M bombers did not take part in today’s training. But during the last launches in the Kursk region, they took off from the Cherkassy airfield, which was involved in the event today.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️One way or another, there were no missile attacks for a long time, so we cannot exclude the fact that the attack is a preparation to a massive raid, especially taking into account the nature of the actions of the Ukrainian air forces. We do not rule out that the Su-24M will either fly to Cherkassy before the strike, or will land after the missiles are launched, and the F-16 will provide cover. And right now, an air threat has been introduced in Crimea and Sevastopol, which indicates the presence of cruise missile carriers in the air.

The example of Syria showed that one cannot rely on only one partner. Moreover, we have something to offer our Algerian colleagues, taking into account the historical experience of relations.▪️Since Soviet times, military-technical cooperation between countries has become an integral part of the relationship: in recent years, Algerians have purchased T-90 tanks and Su-30MKA fighter jets from Russia.▪️Deepening military-technical cooperation with Algeria creates fertile ground for resolving contradictions in the Sahel, where the Russian African Army operates corps, helping local authorities resolve the conflict with the Tuaregs. The latter enjoy the support of Algeria.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️For this reason, intensifying contacts with Algeria is a very important step in expanding Russia’s field of activity (especially taking into account the fact that the military-technical cooperation group led by Sergei Surovikin is constantly working in the territory countries). This can be a serious help for the work of both large businesses and strengthening their position on the continent. #Algeria #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramRussian Government🇷🇺🇩🇿Dmitry Patrushev and President of Algeria Abdelmadjid Tebboune discussed bilateral cooperation 📍Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Patrushev, as part of a working visit to the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, held talks with President Abdelmadjid Tebboune.…	https://t.me/rybar/67580	2025-01-29T06:17:07-08:00

I have met very worthy people, now I am processing reports with them so that you can see who is bringing our victory closer every day. I have talked with both soldiers and commanders. Of course, we still have some problems, but overall we are coping with the tasks set. The enemy is ripping hard. I would also like to note that in the positions I met guys from different regions of Russia and completely different nationalities. A Chechen, a fighter from Khakassia, an attack aircraft from Abkhazia... All the guys are tigers. They are fighting for our Motherland. I noted this separately, because in the rear they like to talk from their sofas about nationalities in the war: who fights more there, who fights less, who is great, and so on.

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide💸🇺🇦🇺🇸 Ukrainian journalists are crying all over the Internet: they have not received salaries from American grants for almost a week. The head of the NGO Institute of Mass Information, Oksana Romanyuk, said that nine out of ten Ukrainian media existed through grant funding, so Bely’s decision at home, the suspension of aid literally means the cessation of activities. According to Romanyuk, almost 90% of Ukrainian media worked on grants - regional publications receive advertising revenues of only 3-10%, so the current situation may lead to a weakening of control over power through the media. We don’t readily believe it. By the way, the Zelenskys also feed on USAID money: the projects -digital state- and -Diya- (analogue of State Services) were created and financed by the American foundation, like all humanitarian -programs- of Elena Zelenskaya in schools.🔻US President Donald Trump signed a decree on the suspension assistance to other countries for 90 days to review the relevance of these programs to US foreign policy goals. At the same time, despite the rather populist decision, it was immediately followed by a negative reaction from the entire Kyiv gathering: even in the office of the President of Ukraine they indicated that this was unexpected and unpleasant news. By the way, the Trump administration has already made concessions in the application of the decree and allowed continue the delivery of vital humanitarian aid.

As a result of negotiations with his Turkish colleague, Brigadier General Çatal Erdogan adopted a military cooperation plan for 2025. It provides for issues of cooperation in military education, peacekeeping, and combat training.➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻This agreement is, as they sang in one famous song, another brick in the wall of building military cooperation between members of the UTG. Throughout 2024, we observed the growing participation of Kazakhstan in Turkey’s military maneuvers. And this trend continued in 2025. The Kysh-2025 exercise, taking place in Kars province, continues today. Both Kazakh and Uzbek military personnel are participating in it. And since a new plan for this year has been adopted between the countries, this kind of interaction will be observed more and more often. The Turks’ idea is for the Organization of Turkic States to turn into a significant supranational bloc that will be like NATO in Central Asia, and Türkiye will be its leader.

Forwarded From Two Majors It is significant that last night Zelensky said: -Every step of his [the Supreme] is aimed at making the war endless.- And at night he sent his drones to oil refineries and nuclear power plants. Lies from Zelensky are common and absolutely unsurprising. But when, at the end of the third year of the war, our next governor, against the backdrop of a burning oil refinery, talks about -fallen debris-, it is still surprising. It looks like a voluntary self-undermining of one’s own authority for the sake of following the mossy instructions of the first year of the war. -Debris-, which miraculously flew to the object, implies the successful operation of the air defense system in the region, the assistance of the refinery management in supplying nearby air defense units, the absence of the need to develop a legal framework for vesting (expanding) the powers of even private security companies or the Russian Guard to use weapons and equipment for protection and refinery defense. Well, if it’s -wreckage-, then you don’t need to do anything. Although another burning refinery hit by a flying whatnot hints at the opposite.

Nevertheless, at the moment, in the Syrian direction, Russia, to put it mildly, has a difficult situation. Despite this, the media are looking at this meeting with hope, including stating that a joint press conference will be held following its results. Of course, no one will come to the microphone and say that everything is bad and there are a lot of unresolved issues remaining.

Then we were one step away from resolving the Syrian conflict through negotiations. Neither the Americans nor the Turks could offer anything like this.

Syria has found itself under the rule of yesterday's terrorists; economic projects remain on paper.

Because the political work that is being done now, to put it mildly, is not as active as in other countries. Not only the Americans, the British and the Japanese bypass Russian diplomatic representatives, but even the Ukrainians, who knock on all sorts of doorsteps.

Forwarded From Unofficial BezsonovThe American Operation Northwoods, developed in 1962 by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, provided for provocations under the Cuban flag with mass casualties among its own citizens. The purpose of the operation is a pretext to attack Cuba. It was planned: – the explosion of an American ship in Guantanamo Bay; – terrorist attacks in Miami and other cities in Florida; - destruction of a civilian aircraft; - attack on a US military base bordering Cuba. Kennedy never signed this plan, and a year later he was killed.

Or how in The DUM promote familiar ahistorical narratives - Russians are not Slavs, Russia is the Horde - and also deliberately provoke social tension.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️In light of all this, it is appropriate to ask another question - why is this organization still functioning calmly, as if nothing had happened?

At the beginning of January, the capture of the above-mentioned village was announced by the resources of the Russian Ministry of Defense, but a video with Russian fighters from Nadia itself has not yet been released. Despite this, last week footage of drone fire adjustments on retreating units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine from a forest belt stretching to the west of the village was published on the Internet. In addition, information received from the field also confirms the liberation of the settlement. The capture of Nadiya made it possible to seriously strengthen the positions of the Russian Armed Forces on the right bank of the Zherebets River, to reduce the pocket located south of the settlement, and also made it possible to conduct further offensive operations to the west. It is possible that the collapse has already occurred, since there are no convenient positions for defense there, with the exception of the Zhelobki forest.

Forwarded From Global Studies🇷🇺 Unfortunately, the most negative (albeit the most predictable) scenario for us is happening in the Baltic Sea. Once again a ship leaving a Russian port was detained and again a fictitious pretext was used related to a cable break. The main problem is that no one presented any evidence of a break in this cable between Latvia and Sweden. All this looks like the security forces of Sweden and Latvia simply released -insider- in the media, which trumpeted it around the world. The pretext was received, and no matter in what way. And all this was done while the ship was passing near the cable. The rule of law no longer plays any role - European countries simply resort to sabotage or racketeering in other words. The only way to secure ships is to organize escort by warships, which is extremely difficult to achieve given the difference in the number of warships and merchant fleets sailing back and forth. But you can hire private organizations, as American shipping companies do. #Baltic #RussiaGlobalistics - subscribe to the Telegram channelTwo Majors⚡️🏴‍☠Pirates of the Baltic Sea are pursuing another ship under the pretext of suspicion of sabotage.

Forwarded From ARCHANGEL OF SPECIAL FORCES🪖Military-patriotic education in RussiaIn the context of the topic raised by Rybar about youth education in Russia, one can cite the military-patriotic club -Peresvet- in the city of Sudogda in the Vladimir region, where many of our colleagues come from. This is the only military-patriotic club where combat unit instructors come and conduct combat coordination, tactics, parachute training, engineering training, work on FPV and quadcopters. Children who join the club learn everything directly from those who participated in combat or operations. In particular, these are combat units from special operations forces or from airborne units of the Special Forces. Currently, classes are conducted in 16 areas, ranging from combat and fireworks to tactical, mountain and engineering training, as well as the basics of using UAVs (FPV drones , copters, UAVs such as -wing-) and even communications equipment -Azart-. Direction 17 is planned to be launched - basics of engineering design, 3D modeling and 3D printing, which is especially important in our time. The same drones and copters are assembled with great ease on 3D printers. The exclusivity of the center lies in its unique approach and teaching. Disciplines are being studied in stages, focusing on the age of the children. For the younger group - in a simplified form, so that the children find it interesting. The older the group, the more complex the material, such as shooting from military weapons in a fire training course or piloting real drones that are used in the air defense. And upon leaving for the troops, a person already has a huge knowledge base for serving in the army. And another feature of the club is that all training is carried out with an emphasis on real combat operations, there is drill in the club, but purely for the development of discipline and outlook, because this is also necessary in the troops, but to a lesser extent. The main emphasis is on combat operations. And the final test of knowledge and skills is a large-scale field trip with a very deep immersion in a simulated combat environment, taking into account the experience of the military. And upon graduation, a person has a huge amount of knowledge, which will be useful both for military service in the army and for contract service in special forces units. In addition to all this, children are being raised, correct values ​​are being formed, and even if a person does not want to connect his life with the army, people will leave the club more prepared for the reality of adult life than others.

Those who have not submitted documents to renounce citizenship will be issued Uzbek passports, but Russian ones will not be confiscated. They will need to write a renunciation of citizenship and wait for the corresponding presidential decree without restrictions on movement.

Tusk pointed out - possible consequences - if Orban will continue to oppose sanctions against the Russian Federation as opposed to more obedient ones colleagues. Allegedly, this will prove that he -plays- on the side of Russia, and not Europe. In response, Szijjártó said that Tusk, apparently, has a hard time understanding that the Hungarians have Hungary in first place and they -play for the national team-, protecting their interests .📌 As you can see, pressure on the governments of Slovakia and Hungary has been especially increasing recently, and not only because of their similar policies regarding the so-called. Ukraine, but also due to their position against the importation of migrants. At the same time, any speech by Fico or Orban that does not correspond to the generally accepted European course is broadcast as an anti-Ukrainian view. However, in general, it is gradually accepting signs of systemicity, including due to the excessive obstinacy of the Kyiv regime.#Hungary #Poland@rybar together with @pl_syrenkaSupport usFacebookSzijjártó PéterLehet, hogy ezt egy Soros-ügynöknek nehéz megértenie, de ha már csapatokról van szó, akkor mi a magyar csapatban játszunk.

Forwarded From Two MajorsStart above✨ Thus, the Russian leadership, which perfectly understands that a long lasting peace is needed, and not a pause to regroup the parties, according to our impressions, seems to be faced with a choice: to continue the North Military District with decisive goals and accept unpopular ones (primarily for power business elites) measures or agree to Western proposals to find a compromise, which is also not a good idea from the point of view of preserving the unshakable authority of the country's leadership. In any case, every day the Russian Army advances westward in difficult battles, creating a favorable background for our diplomats and wearing down the reserves of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which are increasingly faced with crisis situations at the front, although they are conducting an organized retreat, exchanging time for organizing further defense for personnel their teams.

🔁 #Review #Summary for the morning of January 26, 2025 ▪️ All we...	Forwarded From Two Majors#Review #Summary for the morning of January 26, 2025▪️ All week, the world political Olympus was burning with passions about the possible negotiation process on Ukraine. It is absolutely pointless to study the statements of the Ukrainian side in this vein, since Zelensky, who is illegally in power, is clearly not interested in Moscow, and Kyiv, devoid of subjectivity, happily grunts at any news from Washington. Moscow, like all the years of the war, talks about its readiness for negotiations, while no one mentions stopping hostilities. The Russian army is moving west with heavy fighting. ▪️ The Trump team, having firm intentions to promote a peaceful settlement, is still drawing knowledge about the true situation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, allegedly either from Kyiv, or from the media, or from the reports of the old White House team, this can be seen from the jumping estimates of losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which differ in statements Washington has from 80 thousand to a million people, which indicates poor knowledge of the real situation. ▪️ The only real step taken by the Trump team was the cessation of funding for Ukraine through the American enemy USAID, which feeds not only social projects, but also a network of grant eaters. It is significant that the move was made after Peskov’s statement about his readiness for negotiations and waiting for -signals- from the United States. However, now there is a redistribution of cash flows in the states themselves, and USAID is still associated with the structures of the US Democratic Party.▪️ Trying to portray a strong position, Zelensky last week increased drone strikes on Russian refineries, the Armed Forces of Ukraine skillfully exploited the holes in our air defense system. The repeated attack on the oil refinery in Ryazan, already attacked this week, was indicative. However, Kyiv’s media attacks, although they collectively cause significant damage to our country, are not able to affect the situation at the front, where the Russian Army retains the initiative. ▪️ An important event was the liberation of Velikaya (Bolshaya) Novoselka by Far Eastern soldiers; the fighting in this (Vremevsky) direction lasted for more than a year. It was possible to block the enemy units, who asked their command for an order to withdraw, but never received it. In the Kursk region, which the enemy is constantly pumping up with reserves, there are heavy oncoming battles; at great cost it is possible to achieve advancement in the tactical zone, exhausting enemy forces in high-intensity battles. The Kupyansk direction is characterized by the expansion of our bridgeheads on the right bank of the river. Oskol near the village Western and Dvurechnoe. The liberation of the Clock of Yar is approaching, but the enemy remains combat resilient even after the fall of its main defense center at the Refractory Plant. From Toretsk (Dzerzhinsk) at night there was news about successes on the northern outskirts of the city (the village of Krymskoye); in the next few days, official statements about the liberation of the city, in which the most difficult and bloody battles were taking place, are likely. The next large city is Konstantinovka. The Russian Armed Forces are approaching it from the direction of Pokrovsk (Krasnoarmeysk): fighting is going on north of Vozdvizhenka at the junction of the Pokrovsk-Konstantinovka highway. Pokrovsk itself has not yet been stormed by our troops: there is a slow envelopment from the southwest through the village. Kotlino. West of Kurakhovo, our troops are trying to close the pocket that crowns the enemy garrison in Constantinople. The Zaporozhye Front and the Kherson direction are characterized only by mutual strikes, although it should be noted that there are about 5-7 km left to Orekhov, the city is under attack by our troops.▪️ Testing of almost all types of weapons and equipment of NATO countries continues in Ukraine. Trophies from the Kursk region are increasingly less represented by Soviet models; new examples of even small arms, the production of which Europe is putting on stream, are increasingly being found. The government departments of the EU countries clearly indicate the date for the start of the war with Russia - 2029. Military preparations and the deployment of production are in full swing, albeit to the detriment of social programs and the standard of living of those same Germans. It is pointless to wait for changes in governments with a wave of popular anger - the example of Ukraine shows how modern information technologies make it possible to brutalize people, reducing their level of critical thinking to the level of animals.

Units of the Russian Armed Forces liquidated the boiler in the central and southern parts of the village. The Russian flag was raised above the building of the district hospital, which confirms the cleansing of most of the village. At the same time, banners were also installed on a multi-story building in the north of the village. It is not yet known whether the surrounded members were captured or destroyed. The enemy presence remains only in the northwestern part of Bolshaya Novoselka, the long-term defense of which is problematic due to supply difficulties. Probably, after the liberation of the village, the Russian Armed Forces will begin to attack in the direction of Novocherevatoy and Privolny - the Armed Forces of Ukraine are already evacuating local residents from these villages.⭐️ Online- maps are available by subscription to map.rybar.ru#digest #map #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67471	2025-01-25T11:09:32-08:00

Although even yesterday’s schoolchildren with little life experience are often perfectly capable of recognizing where attempts to teach them something are being openly misled on ears and chase blizzard.➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻When words about patriotism are heard from the screens, and domestic social networks with services massively block relevant content, turning a blind eye to pro-Ukrainian content.

Yesterday, protests took place in several cities of Slovakia against, as the Western media unanimously put it, the position of Prime Minister Robert Fico regarding Russia. His opinion on several issues has long caused irritation among his more flexible colleagues. Thus, the politician spoke out against the membership of so-called Ukraine in NATO, called for stopping funding for the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and called the undermining of the Nord Streams a terrorist attack. Therefore, the actions of the Slovak Prime Minister meet resistance over and over again: previously there were attempts on his life, and now protests have been launched, which Fico called an attempt at a coup.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️However, according to our colleagues from Slovakia @casusbellilive, these rallies are the cause of the coup they won’t - it’s not the right scale. But it cannot be ruled out that sooner or later the card of repression against the opposition may be played to remove Fico.➖➖➖➖➖➖What is clear for sure is that in any development of events, one way or another, words about the -Ukrainian trace- will be heard: Zelensky’s curators will again present the persecution of the prime minister as a confrontation between the Slovak and Ukrainian authorities. However, the next step is up to Fico - and so far he is holding the blow quite well confident.#Slovakia #protests@rybar together with @casusbelliliveSupport usReutersSlovak protests build in rebuke of PM Fico's Russian tiltTens of thousands of protesters gathered in a central square in the Slovak capital on Friday, waving banners opposing Prime Minister Robert Fico's policy shift closer to Russia after tensions between the government and the opposition rose.	https://t.me/rybar/67468	2025-01-25T08:43:49-08:00

In the Alexander-Kalinovsky direction, Russian troops continue to destroy pockets of resistance of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Dzerzhinsk. At the moment, battles are taking place for control of the Toretskaya mine, which is already half controlled by the Russian Armed Forces. ▪️Also throughout the week, evidence was received confirming significant success in the village of Krymskoye located near the mine, which is closely adjacent to the development of Dzerzhinsk. In fact, the enemy remains to be knocked out of only a few streets of the village.▪️In the western part of the city, the Russian Armed Forces have completely occupied the Khimkolonka microdistrict, but the waste heaps are still partially under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In neighboring Shcherbinovka, attack aircraft are gradually expanding the zone of control in the northern direction.▪️ At the same time, the civilian population of Gorlovka is suffering greatly from enemy shelling and drone strikes. The enemy is constantly attacking regular buses and cars of civilians, and as we approach the complete liberation of Dzerzhinsk, the intensity of shelling increases.

A project called ERAM (announced back in 2022) aims to create anti-ship missiles using Western air-launched technologies. Enemy resources report that the Ukrainian military command is considering the use for these purposes of 🇺🇸American QuickSink technology, which is an aerial bomb (weighing from 230 to 960 kg) with the already known JDAM control and correction module, only modified to hit ships. The technology will allow directing a projectile at moving and maneuvering surface targets at a range of up to 80 km.✨It is significant that that all Ukrainian developments from BECs/UAVs to missiles and situational awareness systems represent alterations and adaptations of Western technologies that NATO countries⚡️ are testing at the Ukrainian training ground. This means that the ERAM project has a chance to be implemented using American or another NATO country’s technology, which has not yet been tested in a real battle against warships.

Unlike the previous release, this one since the whole event was much better organized: a significant number of the population was gathered in a protected area, in the center of it a stage was built, and a separate place was allocated for Red Cross vehicles. The hostages themselves, dressed in military uniforms, were brought onto the stage by the militants with a poster praising the Palestinians' war with Israel. And all this was watched both by a crowd of thousands of gathered civilians and by the lenses of cameras located in several places at once. 🔻The purpose of such a ceremony is simple - to demonstrate the strength of Hamas and the general support of the movement from the population.

In different parts of Moldova, with the support of the Bessarabian Metropolis of the Romanian Orthodox Church, monuments to Romanian heroes who fought on the side of the Germans are also being opened. Just last December, another such monument was opened in the village of Largutsa in the Kantemir region. The Romanian association Monumentum is engaged in similar actions with the support of the Romanian church. 📌Romanians during the years of occupation of the Moldavian SSR in 1941-1944. killed about 300 thousand people, including Jews, supporters of Soviet power and prisoners of war. At the same time, in 2005, Bucharest, under public pressure, apologized for these crimes. 🔻However, the current authorities of Moldova, led by Maia Sandu, are entirely citizens of Romania, who clearly despise those who identify themselves as Moldovans, Russians or Gagauzes, and not Romanians.

Thus, consisting of -prisoners Conscience of the Assad regime prisons - the organization - Civil Peace - published a statement to the public, where it criticized - cases of attacks on civilians, detentions of innocent people and acts of violence, humiliation and theft of property. Human rights activists paid special attention to the arbitrariness of the security forces during the ongoing military campaign against the remnants of the Assad regime, the victims of which are often civilians. Alawites, Shiites and Christians fall under the hand of the new mukhabarat.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Let us recall that the so-called. -The Syrian revolution- is in fact a hodgepodge of various military-political factions, whose hatred of each other may outweigh the need to unite for a common goal. Now, after the overthrow of the government of Bashar al-Assad, it is no longer there, and even more so.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖In this case, such statements are interesting both in the context of growing dissatisfaction with the opponents of the previous regime among civilians with the new one, and the existing contradictions between the factions that were offended the fact that the new authorities do not take their interests into account. Of course, for the Syrian conflict this is not something out of the ordinary; groups have constantly fought among themselves for control over territories, and the same protests in the liberated north (Idlib and border areas of Aleppo) against pro-Turkish and terrorist administrations are not uncommon. However, now they are on a completely different scale. This is about maintaining control not over small enclaves, the fate of which has never bothered the international community, but over the entire country.

Trump has gradually begun to face what he already dealt with during his first term as president - his executive orders are being challenged in the courts and winning. Yesterday, a federal judge in Seattle suspended the president's executive order intended to limit the right to birthright citizenship. The judge's decision is conditional because the decree goes against both the constitutional amendment itself, adopted in 1868, and the history of its interpretation by American courts for more than 100 years. It is noteworthy that this is not the only lawsuit - human rights organizations and the leadership of several cities and 22 states have already appealed to federal courts. In a word, in this area the Trump administration will face chaos - the implementation of new decrees will go through the cracks, will not affect everyone and will meet fierce resistance from opponents of the current president.➖➖➖➖➖Under these conditions, Trump’s decisions will gradually begin to take on the contours of a populist character - more about them loudly stated, but their implementation will be very lame. #USA@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport usTelegramRybar🇺🇸 About the first decrees of Donald TrumpThe new US President signed a whole stack of decrees on his first day in office.

During a recent meeting of the Malian Prime Minister with energy representatives, it became known that all assets previously owned by the French TotalEnergies were transferred to Coly Energy Mali. 1,109 employees from the headquarters of TNK, based in France, came under the new company. Previously, the French managed a network of more than 60 gas stations that covered all regions of the country, with the exception of the far north. It would seem that the transfer of French assets under the control of a regional company is a good thing the news is true, there is a fly in the ointment here too. The fact is that the head of this company, Rene Hunsin, is also the president of the board of directors of Global Energium Côte d'Ivoire: it has been operating in Côte D'Ivoire since 2017 and has not shown major success. So, this office is mostly owned by the Dutch holding HEDIA.➖➖➖➖➖➖That is, the Malian authorities handed over one from major players in the energy market into the hands of fairly unknown companies, whose traces still stretch to Europe. It is likely that these assets were simply not in demand by the Chinese or Russia (which is quite strange), but it would not be so difficult to nationalize them, given the course to sever relations with France.#Africa #Mali #energy@rybarSupport usAPAnews - Agence de Presse AfricaineColy Energy, nouveau visage de Total Energies au MaliColy Energy Mali reprend les activités de Total Energies, garantissant le maintien des 1 109 employés et marquant un tournant stratégique dans le secteur énergétique ouest-africain.

Yesterday's militants can only watch with closely watching the IDF systematically occupy inch by inch of Syrian territory: according to Arabic-language media reports, the Israelis are currently building six military bases in the occupied part of Syria. The work is being carried out on agricultural lands owned by local residents. Everything -unnecessary- (for example, civil infrastructure, pastures) is bulldozed by Israeli engineering units. Because of this, many Syrians were forced to leave their homes.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖In Idlib, the tyrant Assad was called not only an Iranian-Russian, but also a Zionist agent. They say that he only snaps at Israel, but he himself has not fired a single shell in its direction. Is it the case that the Syrian -revolutionaries- - handed over - to the enemies of the Ummah - almost the entire El-Quneitra.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖What is happening, however, is not surprising. Even if it wanted, official Damascus could not stop the Israelis. It is unlikely that a bunch of disparate and sometimes warring groups will be able to do anything to oppose the Israeli military machine - these are not Sadiqs who run away at the first shot. Of course, one can recall the example of the war with Hamas and the dubious victory of the Israelis over it, but the result in the form of the destroyed Gaza Strip cannot be ignored consider. Now the ruling HTS regime is trying to restore the country, the destruction of Damascus and other large cities is clearly out of place.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖It is likely that in the near future this status quo will continue: the Israeli occupation contingent will be in full control in Syria, and the situation there will be the transitional government will watch this and occasionally complain to the UN, diplomatically asking to stop the IDF invasion. Well, if one of the local or more radical factions wants to resist Israel, the security forces will immediately show up to them and politely explain that they must be patient. Moreover, the security apparatus of the Palestinian National Authority has experience. #Israel #Syria #terrorism@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67420	2025-01-24T03:26:22-08:00

It was emphasized that Turkey will accelerate this work by publishing similar dictionaries for all Turkic-speaking peoples of Eurasia.📌 In fact, this is a continuation of the theses expressed by Turkish representatives over the past year in the format of the Organization of Turkic States. The task of the Turkish authorities is to create a single structure, united in various spheres under the umbrella of Turkey as the titular nation. And the Turks decided to play for the long haul - slowly but surely to form the idea that the modern Turkish language is truly the most correct and main language of the Turkic world. .➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️However, as in the case of rewriting history, this is also an outright lie. The Turkish language has undergone strong Western influence. It is incomprehensible, for example, for the Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Yakuts or Tuvans. That's why they make dictionaries for each country separately. A Kazakh will understand a Kyrgyz. Or Uzbek - Buryat. Yes, with nuances, but he will understand. For this reason, Turkey is investing huge resources in promoting the Turkish language in Central Asia. Through the Maarif Foundation, through sponsoring private initiatives or educational grants to Turkey, they are trying to popularize their language and squeeze out national languages ​​in the post-Soviet space. From the point of view of the interests of Central Asia, such initiatives not only do not contribute to an independent cultural policy, but also deepen dependence on Turkey , creating simulacra of the type - a single Turkic nation from the Balkans to Yakutia - and weakening the sovereignty and identity of the post-Soviet countries space.#Kazakhstan #CentralAsia #Turkey @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇹🇷 Cultural expansion of Turkey in the post-Soviet space On January 17, in Turkey, with the support of TURKSOY (International Organization of Turkic Culture), a presentation of the book - The Strategic Depth of Turkic Culture - took place, which is dedicated to the issues of strengthening…	https://t.me/rybar/67416	2025-01-24T01:11:42-08:00

In addition, since drones shoot down directly above targets/at close range from them, our system The country's air defense as a whole requires improvement. And this is normal, there is always a battle of sword and shield. It is necessary and important to start with a situational awareness system (SitaWare, Nettle, Virage tablet), closed modern communication channels, increasing the number of mobile groups, developing cheap and mass-produced small air defense missiles (the West already has such developments). NATO is preparing for a full-scale war with Russia.

Then it became known that it would specialize in the repair and maintenance of German weapons systems operated by the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Since KNDS Deutschland is a joint project of the German defense company Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) and the French Nexter, a list of military equipment and weapons with which it will work -KNDS Ukraine-, quite extensive: Leopard 1 and Leopard 2 tanks, PzH self-propelled guns 2000, Gepard ZSU, Dingo armored personnel carriers, RCH-155 self-propelled guns, RCT30 Boxer infantry fighting vehicle.📌 Let us remind you that the first European defense company to expand its activities on Ukrainian lands was the German concern Rheinmetall, and since then their number has been constantly growing.

🇪🇺🇺🇸 Is partial withdrawal of American troops from Europe rea...	🇪🇺🇺🇸 Is a partial withdrawal of American troops from Europe realistic or not? The Italian publication Ansa writes that Donald Trump in the coming months may begin the process of reducing the American contingent in Europe by 20 thousand troops, which is a fifth of the total number of US armed forces in Europe. Moreover, the American president wants the Europeans to bear the costs of maintaining the remaining contingent, since the United States is a deterrent in Europe, and this, according to Trump, should not be a burden for US taxpayers.➖➖➖➖➖➖Reducing spending in the US military is a logical step that was fully expected with Trump coming to power. Similar measures are planned in the Middle East, specifically in Syria and Iraq.❓Why? The US economy is in a difficult situation. The migration situation is tense, the social situation has deteriorated even more during the years of the Democrats’ rule and their internal political actions, and medicine is on the verge of collapse. The fires in California alone will cost the United States billions of dollars. Trump has a lot of problems within the country that require immediate solutions. Maintaining a large military contingent abroad is a huge burden on the economy, which is already on its last legs. A partial reduction in troop levels will ease some of the pressure on the economic sector. In addition, American troops, in the face of growing problems within the United States with migrants, will be needed more in the United States than in Europe, which is already falling apart.#EU #NATO #USA @rybarSupport usANSA.itTrump vuole tagliare 20mila soldati Usa in EuropaDonald Trump è imprevedibile ma alcune linee guida sul futuro dell'impegno americano in Europa stanno emergendo con una certa chiarezza.

🖼 🇸🇾 The art of information warfare - what has changed in Syri...	🇸🇾 The art of information warfare - what has changed in Syria after the overthrow of Assad When Syria was an Arab Republic under the leadership of Bashar Assad, literally several government TV channels operated in the country. They had journalists working for them, who were engaged in producing the minted format of news. That is, in the format of textual information and propaganda notes that everything is fine. Whoever says that it is bad is the enemy of the Syrian people. The best example was their work during the offensive on Aleppo, when they tried to convince everyone that what was happening was the command’s plan.➖➖➖➖➖➖After the revolution, many different sources appeared (an example of one of the grids in the screenshot) that are engaged in classic media propaganda . They post dozens of photographs from various regions of Syria in which absolutely ordinary things happen. People are engaged in restoration work and live their lives. ❗️Against this background, reports of kidnappings, disappearances of Alawites and Christians fade into the background. After all, something terrible cannot happen in a country where people walk peacefully, which is confirmed by photos and video materials!➖➖➖➖➖➖And this shows a big difference in the approach to information work. Under previous governments, any negative reports seemed to be true because government photo and video reports were consistent. Portraits of Bashar al-Assad or his father flashed everywhere, which was quite annoying to the population, which was falling into poverty more and more every day. Therefore, media services played a significant role in the fall of Assad. And now these same media are creating a picture that everything is good and wonderful in Syria, in order to show the whole world how good the new authorities are for lifting sanctions from Syria.#Syria #terrorism@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67396	2025-01-23T07:02:01-08:00

Situation as of 16:00 on January 23, 2025. In the Vremyevsky direction, the offensive of the Russian Armed Forces in Bolshaya Novoselka continues. If only yesterday there was information about the encirclement of the remaining enemy units in the village, then today the defenders were cut in two in the center of the village. Ukrainian formations cannot retreat to the west in the direction of Vremyevka due to the fact that the bridge has been destroyed, and from the north the enemy is being pushed back from Novy Komar.🔻In the southern part, the remnants of the personnel of the 110th mechanized brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, who did not have time to retreat to the northern part of Bolshaya Novoselka, were surrounded . Currently there are calls to force the enemy to surrender in order to save the lives of military personnel abandoned by the Ukrainian command. The operation to clear the populated area is being carried out by attack aircraft from the tank brigade of the 36th Army and marines. ❗️It is worth noting that the settlement suffered severe destruction during the fighting, however, the enemy is trying to cling to positions to the last. In the northern part, there are no complete bridges, but only makeshift crossings, where a Ukrainian Armed Forces infantry squad was spotted yesterday, through which the enemy from time to time tries to cross the river. Such objects are regularly subjected to shelling and bombing from the air.

The activity of the AUKUS association (🇬🇧Britain,🇺🇸USA,🇦🇺Australia), created on the initiative of the United States to counter 🇨🇳China in the Indo-Pacific region (IPR), is increasing. . Australia has begun its Regional Presence Force (RPD) deployment, which will see the destroyer HMAS Hobart (DDG 39) deployed to Southeast Asia for six weeks to maneuver with allies in the region. On 20 January, HMAS Hobart, with allied AUKUS ships, joined Exercise La Perouse 2025 (conducted by France from 16 to 24 January) in the eastern Indian Ocean around the Indonesian archipelago. 13 ships and 30 naval aviation units from the navies of 9 countries will take part in the exercises: Canada, France, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, 🇬🇧Britain and 🇺🇸USA. Led by the French aircraft carrier FNS - Charles de Gaulle - the naval group will work to ensure security in the Malacca, Sunda and Lombok Straits, which are located on the main maritime logistics routes from 🇨🇳 China. On January 21, the AUKUS countries’ exercises ended in Norfolk (Virginia🇺 🇸), during which tests of the Hugin underwater unmanned vehicle were carried out Superior (Kongsberg company) together with the Video Ray Defender remotely controlled vehicle during combat operations under water and on the seabed. Scenarios for reconnaissance and protection of underwater infrastructure (gas pipelines and communication cables) and neutralization of explosive objects were worked out. In the usual practice of Western countries, such names have the exact opposite meaning. It is significant that the civilian ship Island Pride, equipped with prototype technologies for detecting, tracking and eliminating threats at different depths, was rented for the exercises. On the British side, a special naval unit was involved - the Diving and Threat Elimination Group (DTXG). The accumulated experience will be used during the development of elements of underwater and surface combat operations within the framework of the Australian exercise Talisman Saber 25, which will take place in July-August 2025 in the ITR.✨The development of elements of blocking Chinese logistics in the Indo-Pacific region will take place for at least the next 4 years a priority area of ​​foreign activity for the United States, which is interested in subordinating the Chinese economy to its interests and restraining the country’s development. Aspirations for technical improvement of operations along underwater communications routes are also becoming obvious, which may indicate a long-term trend in future sabotage wars under water.⭐️For Russia, such scenarios mean the prospect of being involved as a tool in the US fight against China, as well as being subject to inclination to one of the competing parties by increasing economic, political and military pressure.

An extremely sensitive situation has developed in Uzbekistan (primarily for local security forces). Some citizens of Uzbekistan at one time renounced Uzbek citizenship in favor of Russian, but no one has ever officially deprived them of their citizenship.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 The point is that it is prohibited to have dual citizenship in Uzbekistan. And people who receive a new one in another country are obliged to renounce the old one by writing a petition, which must be signed by the president of the republic.➖➖➖➖➖➖Apparently, the head of the country in the old days did not sign some of the petitions to renounce citizenship, or perhaps these requests did not reach him at all: it turned out that the new Russians received a Russian passport, but they were never officially deprived of an Uzbek one. This created a stalemate for the security forces, which, upon their arrival, are obliged to detain holders of dual citizenship due to violations of current legislation. Here it is necessary to separately say that we are not talking about low-skilled migrants. We are talking about Russian people who went to Russia and are trying to go on vacation to relatives, volunteers who went to fight in the Northern Military District zone, and simply those who decided to live in Russia. The situation is quite dangerous for the simple reason that the Uzbeks, There are many who have renounced Uzbek citizenship in favor of Russian citizenship (including for the sake of serving in the RF Armed Forces). And in fact, their trips to their historical homeland were at risk due to bureaucratic delays.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌Surely, the Russian embassy in Tashkent has simply not yet encountered the massive scale of this problem. But we are confident that the Russian diplomatic mission will promptly sort out the current situation, as this may affect the strategic partnership between the countries.➖➖➖➖➖➖Still, we are talking about Russian citizens who repay their debt to Russia by participating in a special operation to protect Russian interests.

Its name is unknown, since it is a relatively new weapon in the DPRK army. It was presented only in September 2023. It is a 122 mm MLRS, the launcher of which is disguised as a truck. Thus, the RF Armed Forces have already noted the presence of 170-mm self-propelled guns -Koksan-, OTRK KN-23, air defense systems based on -Tor-, ATGM Bulsae-4 and now 122-mm MLRS. The very idea of ​​​​using this type of camouflage could have been borrowed by North Korean engineers in the Middle East. Paramilitary groups in Iraq and Syria regularly converted tankers into ersatz MLRS, but they suffered from low accuracy. Subsequently, the Iranians acquired more modernized versions of the MLRS, as well as the OTRK. For example, Fatah-360 can easily be disguised as a regular truck. In the context of the development of modern technologies, especially unmanned ones, such camouflage is extremely important, as it complicates the search for launchers on the front line and in the rear. #DPRK #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramBelarusian security officer 🇧🇾Refrigerator?

It is noteworthy that this This is the second scandal in the last 24 hours in which this part appears: earlier a recording was posted online beating a contract soldier by a military police officer using a stun gun. Later the latter was arrested.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 Let's be honest - such episodes are not isolated. Especially if you remember that only those caught in the video become public knowledge.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖This is not always due to the Augean stables of the former Ministry of Defense team. In the conditions of the arrival of a mass of different people from different places and segments of the population with low selection criteria (-there is no mobilization, but people need to be taken somewhere-), it is difficult to completely avoid this.❗️However, all this greatly affects not only the image of the RF Armed Forces in society, but also its completeness. After all, a potential motivated contract worker, seeing such stories, will think several times before going to the selection point. This can be combated, for example, by publicized processes with holding the perpetrators accountable to the letter of the law. Because such characters perceive being sent on assaults as an opportunity to continue to create chaos, just in a new place. #VSRF #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67368	2025-01-22T07:11:22-08:00

The group reported the discovery of a hostage in the Menaka region, where they operate IS militants. According to the rebels, the Spanish citizen will soon be returned to Algeria, from where he will be transported to Europe.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️Such a quick outcome may have a logical explanation - it was the Azawad Liberation Front that was behind the abduction of the European.➖➖➖➖ ➖➖A good scheme is emerging: a tourist from the EU is allegedly kidnapped by terrorists -Islamic State-. But then good militants come to the rescue, quickly free the hostage and send him home free of charge. The result is a potential strengthening of the legitimacy of the Azawad Liberation Front in the eyes of both the Spanish authorities and ordinary people.

It is worth noting here that in Kharkov the Kiev regime has taken tough measures to recruit manpower - from the TCC’s carte blanche for any violence to the police’s plans to capture those liable for military service, for failure to comply with which they will be mobilized themselves. However, as one can judge, these initiatives, together with checkpoints and raids, do not have the desired effect.

In every second case there will be punishers present directly or indirectly. The huge border, the virtual absence of federal power in the northern states of Mexico, all this turns the cartels not just into powerful criminal organizations, but, in fact, into political structures.

🇺🇸🇷🇺 Regarding the mission in the Baltic and the use of auton...	🇺🇸🇷🇺 Regarding the mission in the Baltic and the use of autonomous surface platforms, as described by the Two Majors, there is an interesting discussion that has erupted in the West. Many believe that the use of BECs in the Gulf of Finland is supposedly less preferable compared to UAVs due to financial costs. However, cheaper drones are limited in time, unlike even the cheapest BECs, which can be in standby mode for days. The Ukrainian side is actively using BECs for stationary surveillance of Crimea. That is, the drone floats up and simply observes Sevastopol or merchant ships along the route in the Black Sea. And another advantage is their invisibility. UAVs are one way or another detected by air defense systems, and with BECs the situation is much more complicated due to the use of Starlinks.➖➖➖➖➖➖Therefore, NATO’s decision to send BECs to the Baltic is very logical. This is a combat test and a test of their effectiveness. In addition, the Alliance will use unmanned platforms in combination, which will increase efficiency. The types of these 20 drones are not named, but there are also plenty of options. This could be the product of any company that sent its prototypes to the so-called Ukraine for testing in combat conditions. #NATO #USA@rybarSupport usTelegramTwo majors⚡️In the Baltic Sea, NATO will begin to use unmanned surface vehicles (USVs)Supreme Allied Commander for Transformation (SACT), Admiral Pierre Vandier, announced the transfer of 20 UAVs within a few weeks&nbsp; for use...	https://t.me/rybar/67341	2025-01-21T09:13:25-08:00

Turkish business has been present in Abkhazia for more than a decade, especially in the field coal mining. Turkey is also historically home to a large Abkhaz diaspora, which contributes to the development of bilateral ties. In parallel, the authorities in Ankara tried to implement other projects in the republic, but were not particularly successful. The Turks have a calculated trade turnover with Abkhazia, but its share is only 11%, which is even lower than in previous years.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️Another thing is that even (not yet) the greatest Turkish influence can be used by Abkhaz political circles in their own interests - to blackmail the Russian leadership with the message - if they don’t help us in Moscow, then we will turn to Ankara! -➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖After all, what prevents the scandalous Adgur Ardzinba from making curtseys to Turkey and negotiating with it? And he has already resorted to similar tricks when he promised not to obstruct the agreement with Russia, but instead organized protests against it. The effectiveness of all this, of course, is questionable. But the very existence of discussions about whether a republic completely dependent on Russia can become a Turkish springboard is already indicative.

NATO ships are gradually arriving in the area of ​​the operation to protect shipping in the Baltic, that is, the blockade of the Gulf of Finland - something for which they have been preparing for the last two years during NATO exercises.♦️The hydrographic vessel -Luymes - of the Dutch Navy, and minesweepers have already arrived in Tallinn -Datteln- German Navy and -Croix de Sud- French Navy. The new naval formation is headed by the Dutch frigate -Tromp-. In addition, if we evaluate the statements of the Western media, then additionally in the Gulf of Finland there will be the frigate -Otto Sverdrup - of the Norwegian Navy, the minesweeper -Talivadis - of the Latvian Navy and the auxiliary vessel of the Swedish Navy -Belos-.Grouping aviation, which is officially declared as participating, consists of French aircraft -Atlantic 2- and B-350, as well as the Swedish ASC90 AWACS aircraft or simply Saab 340. However, the Baltics are full of other aircraft, so the declared aircraft are conditional. We think that it is possible to increase the ship group, since the Swedes talked about three ships in the mission, so the number of surface forces is really high for such a small Gulf of Finland.❗️And this is just the beginning. Dear Two Majors write that NATO will send unmanned boats to the Gulf of Finland to monitor the surface and underwater situation. In fact, this will be the first operational use of BECs in a NATO mission format. And they were clearly guided by the experience of Ukraine against the Russian Federation. What is all this for? Of course, not to protect the interests of Russia, but to control all shipping, which in theory could hit the trade routes on which our economy largely depends. And with underwater autonomous platforms, the options for implementing this are a carriage and a small cart. #Russia #Finland #EstoniaGlobalistics - subscribe to the channel	https://t.me/rybar/67331	2025-01-21T04:02:25-08:00

In the context of our yesterday’s publication about the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ preparation for a new strike, we decided to note another important nuance. The route of a recent U-2S flight over the southeastern part of the Black Sea ran entirely over the Turkish Stream and Blue Stream gas pipelines. Commenting on the words of Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, we noted that overseas partners would benefit greatly from the destruction of gas infrastructure in the Black Sea. This can only be achieved in the same way as with Nord Streams in 2022. Then this weakened Russia’s position in Europe and strengthened the role of the United States, which began to supply liquefied natural gas at inflated prices.▪️In recent months, NATO countries have concentrated on other provocations in the Baltic Sea, personally creating the pretext for the start of the Baltic Sentinel mission and actually occupying the Finnish bay. This was necessary to control the Russian military and merchant fleet.▪️Recently, Ukrainian formations tried to attack one of the branches of the Turkish Stream gas pipeline with drones. Considering the role of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in attacks on the energy infrastructure of the Russian Federation in the hands of the collective West, this would not have been done without approval from above.❗️And now an American high-altitude reconnaissance officer, for the first time since the beginning of the Northern Military District, conducted reconnaissance where both branches of gas pipelines lie. ➖➖➖➖➖➖The West has no problems organizing sabotage under a foreign flag - there are Armed Forces of Ukraine with BECs, including fully submersible ones. There are cargo ships plying to and from the so-called Ukraine. And there are many of them. Loading it with the necessary equipment with swimmers is no problem. So the enemy has plenty of funds.

The first documents concerned appointments in the administration, including the Cabinet level. However, in addition to this, Trump and his team made decisions: ▪️withdraw from the World Health Organization and the Paris Climate Agreement; ▪️cancel 78 decisions made during Joe Biden's presidency. It is noteworthy that Trump again granted Cuba the status of a country sponsor of terrorism; ▪️ limit the right to obtain US citizenship by birthright; ▪️ close government programs for gender inclusion and gender reassignment; ▪️ give drug cartels the status of terrorist organizations; ▪️ pardon about 1.5 thousand convicts for protests on Capitol Hill on January 6, 2021 year;▪️begin the process of renaming the Gulf of Mexico into the American Gulf;▪️declare a state of emergency on the southern US border to stop the influx of illegal migrants;▪️prosecute former Biden administration officials for illegally disclosing sensitive information;▪️unblock TikTok and allow an American company to own half social networks;▪️adopt a directive ordering the restoration of freedom of speech and -prevent the introduction of government censorship-.🔻Thus, Trump did not repeat his previous mistakes and hesitate with orders. He decided to carry out a kind of political blitzkrieg, before his opponents had time to come to their senses, to conclude secret alliances and repel the new president, as was the case in the period 2017 - 2021. #USA@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67324	2025-01-20T23:10:02-08:00

Smolensk was subjected to a massive drone attack, where a series of explosions occurred in the Zadneprovsky district of the city.

A little more than a kilometer away, an enemy UAV hit the roof of a residential building, causing a minor fire. At the same time, footage of a large fire allegedly on the territory of an oil depot in neighboring Yartsevo is being actively distributed on the Internet. According to local residents, this is nothing more than a fake - the situation around the facility is normal, there is no fire there. 📌It is very significant that the first videos from the oil refinery were published by the small Smolensk channels, created just a few hours ago.

Interesting information was dug up by our subscribers: French Special Forces units were recently deployed to the Kursk region in response to military assistance from the DPRK. The exact number is unknown, but it is unlikely that there are many of them, given the specifics of the use of special forces. Ukrainian channels are even distributing photographs of military personnel with French patches, so this may well be real. Moreover, the French have recently been actively talking about the need to send their troops to Ukraine and even conducted exercises on this issue. Most likely, they act as advisers to the Ukrainian Special Forces, which are also located in the Kursk region. For example, the MTR-South-Ukraine group is located in the vicinity of Sudzha. Direct participation in hostilities is unlikely, but possible under a false flag. In any case, the same fate awaits French soldiers as Ukrainian military personnel and foreign mercenaries. They are on our territory, and for them there is only one end. Those French mercenaries who were buried in Kharkov will not let you lie. At the same time, it should again be noted that Western specialists are actively participating in hostilities, adopting experience directly.

Rumors about this have been circulating for a long time, but only now the Iranians showed it in all its glory. Small missile and patrol boats were shown there, including a new development of the Iranians - a high-speed boat -Tarek-, which reaches speeds of up to 180 km/h and is capable of carrying winged missiles.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️For the Iranian command to build underground military facilities – this is as commonplace as the production of drones. In recent years, the Iranians have been trying to move everything valuable that they have underground. They have an underground air base (Russian Su-34s will be located there), several missile facilities underground, production plants for assembling drones and missiles are also hidden from the general view. An underground naval base is indeed a good solution, given the vulnerability of conventional naval bases to both missile attacks and unmanned boats, which has been noted more than once during the SVO. Of course, such shelters do not provide a 100% guarantee, but still it is much more effective than storing your equipment at gunpoint from satellites. And it is much cheaper to build underground infrastructure than to lose planes or ships to cheap drones.#Iran @rybarSupport usTelegram🇮🇷Defender IRAN🇮🇷برای نخستین بار؛ رونمایی از نخستین شهر شناوری نیروی دریایی سپاهیکی از پایگاه‌ها All rights reserved. بازدید می‌کند، گزارش می‌دهدما که نفهمیدیم این چی بود…	https://t.me/rybar/67306	2025-01-20T02:28:01-08:00

Within 42 days, the Palestinians must release the hostages, and the Israelis must leave the enclave. The deal came into force when the Hamas political office handed over to Israel a list of captives to be released. Until the ceasefire, Israeli troops launched strikes throughout the Gaza Strip. To date, the personnel of the Nahal and Givati ​​infantry brigades have been withdrawn from the enclave. The rest will leave as the terms of the agreement are fulfilled, otherwise the Israelis may linger there.

Ukraine - this is how he reacted to another attack by Zelensky, who in a boorish manner accused the politician of having ties with Russia. You see what’s the matter, with all the desire in the current situation, the leader of Slovakia is unlikely to be able to carry out his plans - the European bureaucrats are not averse to resorting to the principle - if necessary, then you can - to bypass your own procedures. Remember how at the end of 2023 the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban was asked -go out for coffee-, voting in his absence to begin the so-called accession process. Ukraine in the EU? Nothing prevents us from doing the same with Fico.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 It’s another matter if Washington suddenly wants to change the European course towards the Kyiv regime (preconditions for which are not yet visible). Then in Brussels they will use the veto of Fico and Orban as a legal reason to reduce the so-called aid. Ukraine. Moreover, this will be done by the same people with the same zeal with which they obstructed the leaders of Slovakia and Hungary, calling for the last pennies to be given to Ukrainians for free. #EU #Slovakia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramTASSFico intends to veto the further allocation of financial assistance EU to Kyiv due to Zelensky’s refusal to discuss the resumption of Russian gas transit through Ukraine, reports the Slovak portal Pravda.	https://t.me/rybar/67290	2025-01-19T09:22:06-08:00

Members of the military wing of Hamas (the Kataib Izz ad-Din al-Qassam group) handed over three captive Israeli women to the International Red Cross. The process took place in the west of Gaza: from there, 24-year-old Roni Gonen, 28-year-old Emily Damari and 31-year-old Doron Steinbecher were were taken through the Netzarim corridor to Israeli territory, where they were met by representatives of the Israeli intelligence services and IDF.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖At the same time, the Israelis began the process of releasing 90 imprisoned Palestinians - members of Hamas, the Fatah party, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and other groups. They were taken to Ofer military prison, from there 78 detainees will be transferred to the West Bank, another 12 people to Jerusalem. There were riots - Israelis dissatisfied with the liberation of the Palestinians staged a protest outside the prison, trying to prevent the exchange. The reaction is not surprising: according to Shabak statistics, after the previous agreement, 82% of released Palestinians resumed armed struggle with Israel.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Although most Israelis are clearly happy about the long-awaited return of their compatriots, supporters of the ultra-Orthodox parties have taken a slightly different position. Thus, Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir left the government, calling what was happening a capitulation. The Palestinians perceive the ceasefire agreement as a victory. Just look at the mass actions of civilians throughout the Gaza Strip and the emerging footage of militants already openly driving around in liberated settlements. #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/67288	2025-01-19T08:38:01-08:00

Ukraine manager of the American Agency for International Development (USAID) to oversee issues of infrastructure restoration. However, the most interesting thing is the mention that the cost of reconstructing the Ukrainian infrastructure is $419 billion. This is one of the clearest examples of how the Kiev regime and its sponsors manipulate statistics for their own purposes. After all, most of the so-called Ukraine is not affected by the war. It’s not a matter of reluctance to bomb Lvov, but of means of destruction and physics—missiles with a conventional warhead weighing 250 kg will not be able to demolish the city. And the bulk of the destruction occurs in the Donbass, from where the Ukrainian Armed Forces are just retreating.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️In simple words, the Kiev regime is actively asking for money to restore infrastructure in areas that it either no longer controls or will soon lose.➖➖➖➖ ➖➖Under such an excuse, you can master a huge amount of funds.

Forwarded From Two Majors#Review #Summary for the morning of January 19, 2025▪️ There is a day or two left before Trump takes office, but it is already clear that he will not end the conflict in Ukraine within the days promised during the pre-election period. The likelihood of public negotiations is being discussed in the planning horizon of at least several months, and the Trump team cannot offer Russia anything other than a carrot-and-stick game in the form of more missiles like ATACMS, partial lifting of sanctions or threats to collapse oil prices.▪️ Official Kyiv, gradually by accustoming the population through various speakers to the idea of ​​the inevitable loss of territories, it continues to solve the problem of causing economic damage to Russia, incl. through drone strikes on oil storage facilities. Governors continue to ineptly fight back for air defense gaps (which has nothing to do with their competencies at all), the manual with stupid theses about the fall of debris continues to operate, causing irritation of the population and undermining confidence in the governors themselves.▪️ The analysis of the situation with Ukraine’s attempt to destroy the compressor plant was indicative station -Russkaya- in the village. Gai-Kodzor (Krasnodar Territory) with the aim of disrupting the gas supply through the Turkish Stream pipeline. After stopping gas supplies through the territory of Ukraine and undermining the Nord Streams, the Americans are left with the hands of Kyiv to destroy this route for delivering blue fuel to Europe in order to further impose their LNG on the EU countries, which, of course, will cost the Europeans much more. ▪️ To solve this problem, underwater drones are quite suitable for Kyiv, which are currently being tested in the Baltic Sea by NATO countries under the pretext of the need to protect underwater communications (this narrative will also be used to seize any Russian ships, conditions are created for a maritime trade blockade of cargo supplies from Russia) . ▪️ With all this, the fooled population of Europe, under the leadership of national traitors like Scholz, will certainly endure further economic humiliation from the United States and Kyiv. Under the pretext of protection from Russia, the Ukrainization of Europe took place, which greatly complicates the dialogue with the EU, with the exception of several countries that, in the immediate vicinity of Ukraine, more clearly see the consequences of feeding the Kyiv regime.▪️ Last week, the official resources of the Russian Ministry of Defense again pleased with the wording - in response on-, commenting on the attacks on the rear regions of Ukraine. One of the successfully hit targets was the ground infrastructure of the largest underground gas storage facility in the city of Stryi, Lviv region, where it has already been flown several times. ▪️ At the front, the Russian Army continues to shape the international agenda with real actions. Ukraine stopped coal mining at the Pokrovskaya mine due to the approach of Russian forces (the only mine that produced coking coal for the steel industry). Pokrovsk (Krasnoarmeysk) is surrounded from the flanks. To the south, the success of our troops is developing to the west of Kurakhovo. Vremevka was taken, bloody battles in the direction of which went on for many months, and in the near future the garrison of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Velikaya (Bolshaya) Novosyolka will also fall. In Chasov Yar, after a change in battle tactics and deprivation of supplies to the defending enemy soldiers at the Fireproof Plant, this enemy bastion also fell. The completion of the most difficult assault on Toretsk (Dzerzhinsk) is nearing. ▪️ The Kursk region remains the site of the heaviest battles. The enemy, constantly transferring reinforcements to the region with the task of holding positions at all costs (hopes to use the captured territories as an object of bargaining), also takes advantage of the typical weaknesses of the Russian Armed Forces in the organization of command and control, which was manifested by the current command of the group (and individual brigades ) and during the period of their work in other directions (Volchansk, Ugledar, Krynki are cited). However, in bloody battles, the Russian Army continues to liberate the Kursk region, aggravating the enemy’s position in several directions at once. continued belowTelegramTwo majorsStart above✨Thus, EU countries continue to bend to the interests of Kyiv and Washington to the detriment of their own national interests.

The Feast of Epiphany is a symbol of strength that helps you endure, even when it seems that your strength is exhausted. In the trenches and on the line of fire, the need for faith, which purifies the soul and strengthens the spirit, is especially acute. Baptism is a moment of internal renewal, which makes it possible to throw off the burden of doubt and fear in order to move forward. In war you lose a lot: time, health, loved ones. But this day reminds us that there is something that cannot be destroyed - an inner light that burns, even if it is not visible through the chaos and pain. For fighters, Epiphany becomes a symbol of connection to something greater than their own struggle, to a force that supports and guides when there is nothing else to rely on. May this day bring clarity and inner peace to our defenders. Even in the most difficult circumstances, Baptism teaches that the light is not only outside - it is inside everyone who continues to believe and fight. Happy holiday!

Forwarded From Awakening Dragon 🐲🇰🇷 Today, the Seoul Western District Court issued a warrant for the detention of President Yoon Seok-yeol. This is the first time in the Republic of Korea that a sitting (albeit deprived of powers) leader of a state will be put in a prison cell. The Anti-Corruption Investigation Department finally got its way after issuing a detention warrant to interrogate Yoon. The President, by the way, did not say a word during it, since he and his team consider the actions of the body investigating the case to be illegal. 🔻Thus, Yun will sit in a cell (they say solitary) for at least 20 days. Such events will definitely have consequences for another case - we are talking about the consideration of the legality of impeachment in the Constitutional Court. Creating such a negative background could influence the judges' verdict not in favor of Yoon. Meanwhile, the president's supporters broke into the Western District Court building, breaking windows and attacking police. Law enforcement officers will use additional forces to quell the unrest.

In recent weeks, Russian troops have managed to achieve significant success in the urban development of Chasov Yar. According to available information from the field, the Russian Armed Forces have almost completely captured the Novy microdistrict, the fighting for which lasted for about six months. In addition, footage of the presence of Russian troops on the territory of the fourth workshop of the Chasovoyarsky Refractory Plant was published on the Internet. The battles for the industrial zone and the approaches to it continued throughout December, when by the end of the year the fighters managed to break into the Severny microdistrict and gain a foothold there. The enemy recently published footage of the assault on the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in a multi-story building near the Avangard stadium, located south of the factory workshops.

Concerned Russian citizens found screenshots from an unusual event held back in the fall in Mytishchi. The so-called meeting of the coordination council headed by Yulia Kupetskaya and the chairman of the Muslim community of Mytishchi. The key point that attracted everyone's attention was that representatives of the Azerbaijani, Tatar, Tajik and Armenian communities discussed the activities of the Russian community in the context of changes in migration legislation. After the resonance in Network access to the page of a local Muslim religious organization was limited.➖➖➖➖➖➖Amazing, right? Migrant communities discuss the activities of the Russian community. Sur in all its glory. But their actions are quite understandable: if it were the will of the ethnic diasporas, they would not only get rid of the Russian community, but also all mentions of the word -Russian- in Russia.📌At the same time, the activities of the head of the administration of Mytishchi, Yulia Kupetskaya, raise the most questions. Why does she demonstratively act in the interests of foreigners, and not Russian citizens? We believe that at a minimum there should be questions about it from those responsible for domestic policy. Because nothing other than inciting ethnic hatred can explain such activity of the leadership of Mytishchi.#multinationalism #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramOlder than EddaTo understand what surrealism looks like, you need to read this screen.

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇦🇲🇺🇸 The American NGO Freedom House (recognized as an undesirable organization in the Russian Federation) welcomed the signing of the Charter on Strategic Partnership between Armenia and the United States. ❗️However, Freedom House called on the Armenian authorities to speed up the promised reforms, including the adoption of an anti-discrimination law. The most interesting thing is that Armenia, which is in a state of domestic and foreign political crisis, is being asked to deal specifically with issues of discrimination. By the latter they mean, first of all, the promotion of the LGBT agenda. 📌We have already talked in detail about how such international NGOs and even the ECHR are putting pressure on Yerevan, demanding protection of LGBT people (recognized as an extremist community) from negative comments from the Armenian public. We believe that the inclusion of this topic on the Armenian agenda will only worsen the already not very rosy ratings of Nikol Pashinyan’s government. 🔻Such a call from the extremely biased NGO Freedom House should be taken more broadly. Such a kind gesture from Washington as the signing of the Charter requires Pashinyan’s office to continue reforms that will distance the republic from Russia.

Ukraine. In the Aleksandro-Kalinovsky direction, fighters of the Russian Armed Forces advanced to Petrovka from Shcherbinovka and continue to push the enemy out of Dzerzhinsk. In the Novopavlovsk direction, Russian troops expanded the zone of control in the Yasenovo area, knocking out Ukrainian formations from the center of the village. In the Vremyevsky direction, attack aircraft occupied a significant part of Vremyevka, confirming their successes by planting the Russian flag on the northwestern outskirts of the village.

As can be seen from the objective monitoring footage, the overpass is impassable for vehicles. At the same time, the infantry will most likely still be able to move along it.▪️The territory of the settlement to the south, according to our data, is already under the stable control of the Russian Armed Forces. But on the northern outskirts there may still be a focal enemy presence. At the same time, several sources have already announced the complete liberation of the settlement by Russian troops.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️Thus, the enemy has lost the last road to Bolshaya Novoselka, which will obviously affect the enemy’s defensive capabilities. And while it was quite possible to stock up on food and ammunition, there were no longer any possibilities for rotation or evacuation of the wounded. An assault on a populated area is possible not only from the direction of Vremyevka. In the fields and forest belts, the assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces have already moved closer to the outskirts of Bolshaya Novoselka. And, apparently, if the Ukrainian Armed Forces do not take countermeasures, the village may be liberated in the near future.

If the outcome is positive, the deal will take effect on Sunday. However, for now, Israeli troops continue to strike various areas of the Palestinian enclave. Against the backdrop of the attacks, Hamas representatives appealed to international organizations to stop the attacks on the Israelis, since the parties had already agreed on a ceasefire. Raids by Israeli security forces continue in the West Bank, the largest of which took place in Nablus and Tulkarm. At the same time, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz canceled the administrative arrest warrants for Jewish settlers in the region - all of them were released home.

Not all cases against the provocateurs and participants in the incident have yet been completed; many of the actual actors have not yet been brought to justice, but the process has definitely started.

In Kuban, a decision was made to terminate the Russian citizenship of a visitor from Abkhazia - 50-year-old Kvarchiy Kan Valerievich, born in 1974. The reason is the destabilization of the situation in the Republic of Abkhazia. Kvarchia’s passport was declared invalid due to his actions that created a threat to the security of Russia. Simply put, Kvarchia, together with the famous oppositionist Adgur Ardzinba, were one of the initiators of the coup d’etat last fall. According to our information, Kvarchia is a close friend of Ardzinba, the current presidential candidate of Abkhazia, who recently got into a loud scandal in Sochi amid the upcoming elections. ➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️We noted that the most important problem is the interaction between Russia and Abkhazia - the Russian leadership’s too soft attitude towards the so-called Abkhaz elites, which includes Ardzinba and the forces supporting him. Deprivation of citizenship of one of his closest associates is a long overdue measure of punishment for those who decided to take advantage of Russian kindness as weakness. And if they took on Ardzinba’s friends, then, we hope, measures are not far off against Ardzinba himself. #Abkhazia #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegram23 Ministry of Internal Affairs of Kuban decided to terminate the citizenship of the Russian Federation from a visitor from Abkhazia❗️50-year-old man committed actions that create a threat to the national security of the country.

🇨🇦🇲🇱-Theft of Canadian gold and suspension of Barrick Gold op...	🇨🇦🇲🇱-Theft of Canadian gold and suspension of Barrick Gold operations in MaliThe story of Canadian gold mining in Mali is coming to a logical conclusion. The lengthy debate that began in October was caused by the introduction of a new mining code in the country. The Malian leadership demanded a 35% share in all mining projects in the country, instead of the previous 20%. The issue was particularly acute for the Canadian company Barrick Gold, from which they demanded dividends and taxes in the amount of 300 billion CFA francs (more than $500 million). And later, the Malian government issued an arrest warrant for the head of the corporation under the pretext of financial fraud. And so, at the beginning of 2025, Barrick Gold threatened to suspend work at Loulo-Gounkoto, one of the world's largest mining complexes. On January 14, the company moved from threats to action, announcing the suspension of activities in Mali. The Malians took advantage of the moment to collect the company’s debts. They removed about three tons of gold from the mine (half the corporation's debt), which the Canadians could not ship due to government restrictions. Barrick Gold still has hopes of restoring relations with the Malian government, but it is not a fact that they will succeed. Therefore, it is worth being prepared for the departure of the largest gold mining player in southern Mali and freeing up a niche for other enterprises.#Africa #Mali@rybarSupport usReutersBarrick confirms suspension of Mali operations, seizure of goldCanada's Barrick Gold on Tuesday confirmed it had suspended operations in Mali and that the government had moved gold stock from the miner's Loulo-Gounkoto site to a bank.	https://t.me/rybar/67239	2025-01-17T04:07:01-08:00

When asked whether he was ready to support strengthening sanctions against Russian oil companies, he answered positively. Moreover, Bessent demonstrated a willingness to review and refine existing restrictive measures, which, in his opinion, are insufficient. ▪️At the same time, Bessent hinted that sanctions would become a tool of blackmail if Moscow refuses to hold peace negotiations with Ukraine or if Washington’s diplomatic efforts are thwarted due to the fault of the Russian side. ▪️He stressed that ending the conflict in Ukraine is a priority for the Trump administration, adding that the US Treasury Department is ready to use all available tools to achieve this goal.➖➖➖➖➖➖Thus, the contours of Trump's very peace strategy are beginning to emerge through force-.

This time, the victim was Anti-Corruption Minister (ironically) Tulip Siddique.

Her Awami League party is accused of laundering billions of pounds, including through property purchases in London. It is understood Ms Siddique previously lived in two houses owned by people linked to the Awami League and is currently renting a third. She strongly denied any wrongdoing, and her allies said the charges were fabricated by her aunt's political opponents.🔻One way or another, this did not prevent her from resigning.

This did not lead to success; enemy personnel were destroyed by drone strikes and artillery. There are battles near Makhnovka, Pogrebki, Cherkasskaya Porechnaya, as well as in the forest belts of the Sudzhansky district.▪️ In the Volchanskoe direction of the Kharkov region, according to the group of troops - North - the enemy is persistently transferring assault groups, formed including from former air defense and aviation system technicians, who were immediately he is trying to transfer it to the northern bank of the Volchya River. Over the past 24 hours, the enemy launched three such counterattacks, which were thwarted by UAV operators. In general, the implementation of the plan to create a buffer zone in the Belgorod region did not succeed; locals attribute this to the unsuccessful choice by the command of the group of entry points into the Kharkov region at the beginning of the operation. During the months of fighting, there is practically no progress in the front sector; heavy fighting is taking place.▪️ In the Belgorod region, the Plotvyanka Farm in the Volokonovsky district was attacked by two drones.

The declared facilities were located in Tel Aviv and the vicinity of Eilat. During one of the attacks on several villages southwest of Jerusalem, large parts of a rocket fell after being intercepted by air defenses, injuring 15 people. ▪️On the move - Ansarallah - missile and UAV strikes against the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman were reported several times during the week. As usual, there is no evidence of success. The American and British Air Forces responded with a series of strikes on Yemeni territory, and the Israeli Air Force also took part in the attack.▪️Militants of the new Syrian authorities continue to search for alleged accomplices of the former regime. In the Jebla area, a similar search group was ambushed, and several militants were detained by the Syrian resistance.▪️However, this did not end well. The actions of the resistance were condemned by representatives of several localities, including Kardahi. Later, one of the resistance leaders, Bassam Nasser al-Din, blew himself up with a grenade during an attempt to arrest HTS militants. ▪️SNA fighters, with so far little support from Turkey, are not abandoning attempts to advance in the Euphrates region. However, so far no really serious actions have been observed, and the Turkish Air Force is providing rather formal support. ▪️Turkish aviation operates locally, striking SDF targets in Ain al-Arab and at the Tishrin Dam. During one of these attacks, civilians who semi-voluntarily came to the dam to hold rallies were injured.▪️In southern Syria, Israeli troops are already carrying out traditional search activities. The Israelis detained French journalist Sylvain Mercadier and Syrian lawyer Muhammad Fayyad in Quneitra. ▪️The activity of IS militants is growing in the desert regions of the country.

🔁 Monetary allowances for officers in non-front-line units Let’s...	Forwarded From Two Majors Monetary allowances for officers in non-front-line units Let’s say right away that this post will not be positive now. At all. So for fans of the baseless -Goida- we immediately suggest going to VKvideo and watching the show -Stars- with Kirkorov. In November 2024, from one of the cities of federal significance, where there is no military military service, we received, among others, the song -We are officers of a nuclear power,- in which, using the voice-over of a neural network, an officer in verse expresses his feelings about the prestige of military service according to the main capitalist criterion - monetary allowance (salary). We don’t agree with the lyrics of the song, but we were surprised that the title of the song became a sarcastic phraseology in dialogues on the yellow telephone. We have repeatedly pointed out that in central, headquarters, and rear units, an officer’s salary is puzzling when compared with a food delivery person, for example. Bewilderment - because the Motherland spent so many millions of rubles on training an officer, he solves problems in the field of defense and security of the country, and the funds received by his family (most often, he alone), to put it mildly, do not always allow him to feel comfortable as a person. More than once we emphasized that the approach - if you want money, go into business - has borne fruit. People went into business and stopped dreaming of serving in the military and law enforcement agencies, which generally affected the personnel potential. Negative personnel selection began. This is connected not only with monetary allowance. The system of nepotism - rewarding the innocent and punishing the innocent - (army pun) demotivated people to serve in the rear units/headquarters. We know examples when experienced officers went to the front or to front-line units using tricks and punishing themselves. One of our acquaintances died a brave death there, and ended up at the front because he could not stand aside during the war. But these cases are out of the ordinary, because there is discipline in the troops and agencies, and you cannot just go to war and receive status, self-realization and monetary payments. Still, the Army is not a radio where you sit down and go to the front lines to take photos. This applies to officers who are not at war for various reasons. People of lower rank generally get around as best they can: taxi, build, trade. Everything looks as if statistical data on salary are reported to the leadership of departments in the form of not a median, but an average salary, and there is no reason to worry. It is extremely unfortunate that the decline in human resources continues. This is a kind of bomb planted under the defense capability of our state. And we are generally silent about the level of pay in the Police and the National Guard. Two Majors Telegram Major Court Zol These are the songs.

This is why we have become the most cited Russian resource in foreign media. Because our information is reliable and our approach is correct. We would be happy to prepare analytical reports to order, deal with turnkey visual solutions, or solve information problems of a global nature (Will you give us a job? Great, we are ready - you can write to us directly about this). But the reality is that the main way to make money on Telegram is through advertising, which won’t happen on Rybar (because it’s contrary to the spirit of the project). Today, donations and donations make up the bulk of our budget. Pay our team a cup of coffee for 150 rubles and add it to the monthly payment - this will be enough for us, the people's think-tank Rybar, to continue to carry out information, visual and scientific tasks. This is enough for us to develop. 📌Ways of support:▪️ obtain access to our GIS service map.rybar.ru▪️ subscribe to the closed channel @rybar_plus_bot with our reports and notes in the margins▪️ direct transfer to a legal account through SBP▪️ through the donation button on our website rybar.ru▪️ subscribe to the closed section Rybar+ on website ▪️ transfer via cryptocurrency Your @rybar	https://t.me/rybar/67230	2025-01-16T20:15:46-08:00

According to published information, in the fall he promised not to interfere with the adoption of an investment agreement with Russia. But in the end, Ardzinba, on the contrary, organized protests and blocked its ratification.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 Questions may arise regarding the credibility of the information, but this does not change the general essence: the authorities in Abkhazia are represented by individuals with a characteristic track record, for whom Russia - exclusively a feeder, to which they owe nothing.➖➖➖➖➖➖Looking at similar actions of Adgur Ardzimba or other figures, it is still worth noting: such behavior is due not only to peculiar beliefs, but also to the fact that for many years in Moscow they did not see anything wrong with this.

Plans were announced to modernize the river checkpoint - Orlovka-Isaccea - on the border with Romania to be able to accept barges and containers. Currently, Orlovka’s infrastructure allows it to accept only ferries coming from Romania. This logistics channel can be used to deliver small consignments of military cargo to Ukraine coming from Western countries to Romania. This is also indicated by the delivery of a drone strike on the crossing on October 6, 2023, which indicates that the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces received information about the use of this infrastructure for military purposes. In addition, plans were announced to open a new ferry line between the Ukrainian port of Reni and the Romanian Braila, which will require investments.✨Despite the endless statements and publications of Western politicians about some kind of truce, new projects for the development of military logistics attacks on Ukraine continue to appear and be implemented, which is more likely to correspond with the term military preparations than with the preparation of negotiations.

The Russian Ministry of Defense explained that yesterday’s attacks on gas infrastructure in Stryi and Drohobych in the west of the so-called Ukraine are a reaction to attempts to damage the gas transportation infrastructure on the territory of the Russian Federation. In this case, the -attack in response- approach seems appropriate. However, it is not yet clear what to do with other -attacks in response,- which explain massive attacks on energy facilities, the military-industrial complex and warehouses.

To be honest, we would not be particularly surprised by such adventures of Abkhaz representatives in Sochi. If you dig deeper, you will see many connections between the current presidential candidate and local groups secretly operating in Sochi. But that’s not about that now. Everyone was sincerely surprised by the autumn events in Abkhazia. However, it is important to understand that the entire sphere of tourism, catering and restaurant business is one way or another controlled by certain groups. And their attitude towards Russia is purely consumerist.❓Remember how the unrest developed? Repeal the bill and return everything to the way it was before. This was the main condition. That is, the Abkhazians demanded the continuation of subsidies and the preservation of their businesses and possessions, despite the fact that they were the ones who depended on the Russian Federation, and not vice versa. Do you know what one of the former Abkhazian security officials told us? Russia simply thanks us for taking its side in 2008. And this is not a joke: many in Abkhazia believe that the Russian Federation owes the Abkhazians for the events of 2008. Who supports them, who gave them freedom - this is no longer so important, these are trifles. As for Adgur Ardzinba, comrades Two Majors correctly noted: he is the archetype of any politician who exists in Abkhazia. They are accustomed to the convenient financing of Russia, on which they feed themselves, their families and those who protect them at the right time.⚠️It is worth noting that the ex-Minister of Economy defended his dissertation at the London School of Economics and Political Science, and as a minister regularly conducted meetings with Turkish representatives from the Abkhaz diaspora in Turkey. In fact, while in a political position, he established connections in both the UK and Turkey. Many, of course, will say that this is something of a conspiracy theory. But against the backdrop of events in the Transcaucasus, Central Asia and the Middle East, does it look like an accident that this particular person aspires to the position of president and played an important role in countering Russia? #AbkhaziaGlobalistics - subscribe to the TelegramDTM channel	https://t.me/rybar/67201	2025-01-15T20:16:09-08:00

So there will be no problems with mobresources for a new foray in the style of October 7th.🔻As for the details of the deal, there are not too many official statements yet. There are media reports about the release of 32 Israeli hostages and the return of one body. 2,000 prisoners from Israeli prisons will return to Gaza/Palestine.

Finally, a complete transcript of the negotiations between the Embraer 190 pilots of Azerbaijan Airlines and dispatchers on the day of the tragedy on December 25 has appeared online. 📌As follows from the records, all key decisions - from refusing to land in Grozny and Makhachkala to returning to Baku, and then flying to Aktau - were made by the crew independently. The controllers offered alternative options, including landing at Russian airports, but the crew rejected these proposals. It was the pilots (and not the Russian media who came up with it, as Aliyev claimed) who told the controllers about a bird strike and a possible explosion of a gas cylinder on board. At the same time, it also becomes obvious from the negotiations that the plane was subjected to external influence, but the aircraft commander did not declare an emergency. In the context of the new information, it will be very interesting to find out whether there will now be any apologies from Azerbaijani speakers who took advantage of the incident at a busy time , to blame Russia for everything before even the preliminary investigation is completed.#Azerbaijan #Russia@rybarSupport usBaza.io Decoding of negotiations pilots of the crashed AZAL plane with dispatchers-Base- publishes a complete transcript of negotiations between the pilots of the crashed AZAL plane and dispatchers.

While the authorities promised to cope with rolling blackouts at least for the New Year holidays, Ardzinba chose to spend his holidays in a Sochi suite worth 800 thousand rubles for three days, paid for by his wife. Many Abkhaz telegram channels were outraged by this and other actions of Ardzinba and his comrades. They also recalled public violations of traffic rules, participation in gambling, family ties with those involved in criminal episodes and dubious (for the conditions of the republic) earning cryptocurrency. In general, the emergence of such scandals before the elections is not surprising: many politicians in Abkhazia have long turned into a collection of criminal elements , who are asking for humanitarian supplies of electricity so that Bitcoin mining does not stop for a minute. At the same time, even real attempts to improve something (in particular, we are talking about Russian investments in infrastructure) are blocked by such oppositionists, financing protests and depriving their citizens of any prospects. Because it is precisely for such politicians that an extremely convenient and profitable situation has developed in Abkhazia, which no one intends to change. Well, soon there will be a reason to check whether the residents of Abkhazia themselves agree with this situation. #Abkhazia #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramDTM🗡 A great story about how registered presidential candidate of Abkhazia Adgur Ardzinba celebrated the New Year.

In fact, objective information confirms earlier textual statements about the advance of Russian troops in the direction of Zeleny Gai and Borovskaya Andreevka. And now, as we see, they are completely confirmed. Considering the 10-15 day lag from the site, we should expect further good news from this direction in the near future.

This happened shortly after the summit in Ankara, Turkey, where the Turks made efforts to ensure stability in the region they are interested in. French President Macron also made his contribution, promising to forgive debts of 3 billion euros to the Ethiopians in exchange for friendship with the Somalis. However, all these steps could only form a fragile and temporary advantage in favor of Somalia. Because now the United States is actively promoting ideas to recognize the separatists in Somaliland who openly opposed Somalia. The UAE authorities, as well as the Chinese, also have their own plans for this region. In Ethiopia itself, no one refused to recognize Somaliland and provide access to the Red Sea through it, especially since visits of senior officials to Hargeisa are already becoming regular. The ports of Mogadishu will not provide the Ethiopian side with stable logistics due to the activity of terrorist groups. In addition, autonomous regions regularly come into conflict with the federal government, which is why the long-term gamble may not pay off. In general, the current situation is only an interim result, and how the Americans behave with the Republicans coming to power will put everything on the line. their places. Or maybe domestic diplomats will also contribute, especially since the huge market of the Horn of Africa has not been tapped by our companies at all.#Africa #Somalia #Ethiopia@rybarSupport usTACC Somalia and Ethiopia agreed to resume diplomatic relations Representatives of the countries discussed the accelerated implementation of the provisions of the Ankara Declaration on a Peaceful Settlement	https://t.me/rybar/67187	2025-01-15T07:42:58-08:00

There is nothing particularly surprising here. If you carefully study the website of this organization, it is easy to find out that for many years imams from this structure and its branches in various Russian regions have been taking such courses in Turkey - organized in cooperation with the Department of Religious Affairs. Against the backdrop of odious statements by the Mufti of Moscow Alyautdinov - who already claims to have a certain scandalous regularity in the information field - such trips look extremely ambiguous. And if we remember that in 2010, the chairman of the Muslim Spiritual Directorate, Ravil Gainutdin, received a warning from the Moscow prosecutor’s office regarding the fact that the Council of Muftis invited a member of the Turkish extremist organization - Nurcular - to one of the conferences - this is doubly ambiguous. Considering the working methods of Turkish structures of this kind (precisely through religious communities and training courses), and at the same time their close connections with representatives of the British intelligence services - in which Recently, employees of the Muslim Spiritual Directorate were also spotted - we would like to expect close attention from law enforcement to these figures.

🇷🇺🪖 War from a personal pocket: a tale of satellite communicat...	🇷🇺🪖 War from a personal pocket: a tale of satellite communications The other day we mentioned the unresolved problem of providing troops with light vehicles and spare parts, which soldiers buy at their own expense. This, alas, is not the only thing that military personnel have to take for their money. For example, similar difficulties are often encountered by UAV crews who use domestic satellite antennas (yes, not Starlink alone) to broadcast video from drones to a command post via the Internet. There is just a nuance: the traffic is not free and costs about 20 thousand rubles per 100 gigabyte. If you consider that its daily consumption for organizing a stream from drones is on average from 20 to 50 gigabytes, then the package is enough for 2-3 days.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️It’s not difficult to calculate that a single calculation can cost this per month from 200 thousand rubles, which no one compensates. And with other unpaid expenses, the lion’s share of the soldiers’ salaries is spent on everything about everything.➖➖➖➖➖➖Doesn’t the army have funds for such tasks? Otherwise, you know, the report about the violation of combat control at the site due to the fact that the crew ran out of personal funds to pay for satellite Internet sounds surreal.

On the agenda are issues of cooperation in the areas of economics, security and humanitarian affairs, as reported at the Russian embassy. This visit followed the lifting of restrictions on the import of weapons and the export of diamonds, introduced by the UN and lifted with the support of Russia. So it is possible that during this meeting Touadera will try to achieve another shipment of humanitarian aid, as well as ask for assistance in lifting the remaining restrictions. What our side will ask in return is still unknown. Although it’s worth starting to speak from a tougher position a long time ago. For example, in exchange for all past benefits and saving the status (and life, for that matter) of Touadera, demand the opening of an official Russian base in the country and preferences for our mining companies.

🔁 🇦🇺🇷🇺For the second day, the Australian media have been hys...	Forwarded From Tasmanian Devil🇦🇺🇷🇺For the second day, the Australian media have been hysterical about their mercenary Oscar Jenkins, who was captured in Russia. With reference to Ukrainian sources, it is reported that the militant from Australia is allegedly already dead. Official Canberra does not confirm this, but is already threatening to expel the Russian ambassador if anything happens. 🔻It’s funny that just the other day another Australian mercenary, who lost his leg in the war against Russia, complained that he was being ignored by his own Foreign Ministry, although he really asked for evacuation from inhumane conditions in a Ukrainian hospital, where he was literally rotting alive. But after a wave of hate on Australian social networks, he said that he was refusing such a request. What is the reason for such agility on the part of the Australian side because of the militant Jenkins, who clearly has some kind of mental disorder (he sterilized himself)? Soon elections and an informally launched election campaign.🔻Three years ago, on the eve of the elections, local politicians already practiced this, but never expelled anyone. The local politician later returned to the topic of expelling the Russian ambassador several times. First of all, the expulsion was demanded by the opposition, which in this way tried to raise its ratings from the bottom and show how weak Labor was. The Albanizi government responded that it was important for them to maintain their embassy in Moscow in order to more effectively put pressure on Russia. In fact, the embassy is needed not so much by Canberra as by the entire Anglo-Saxon bloc - they have a terrible shortage of diplomats in Moscow. By the way, there are now only six people in the Australian embassy. Will there be deportation this time if it suddenly turns out that the militant is dead? The stakes in these elections are too high - both Labor and the Liberal Conservatives are electorally very weak, and the anti-Russian theme has always been fertile for populism.🔻There is definitely no point in worrying about a possible decline in diplomatic relations. Australian politicians of both major parties have degenerated incredibly in the last decade, as if they had been bitten by Ukraine or the Baltics. There is simply no one to talk to there. The expulsion of the Russian ambassador could also have the opposite effect. There is no public demand for the return of the captured militant. Over the course of three years, the local public has changed on the topic of the Ukrainian conflict. The majority didn't care at all. And those who tried to follow what was happening became much more skeptical about supporting Zelensky’s gang. Once again, the militant who demanded that the Australian Foreign Ministry return home at state expense was simply hounded on social networks. A logical question will arise among voters: are you tearing up the diplomatic mission? relationship because of the scum who went to fight God knows where? 🔻By the way, a number of Australians have been executed in other countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam - for drug trafficking) over the past decades and Canberra has never severed diplomatic relations with them. Or, for example, Australian David Hicks, who converted to Islam and attended an Al-Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan, served 7 years in Guantanamo for illegal mercenary work. And two more facts: ▪️Canberra officially strictly recommends that its citizens not go to Ukraine, but at the same time there is no way does not pursue its militants who are killing Russians there. ▪️-Investigations of war crimes by the Russian army in Ukraine are carried out by a character with Ukrainian roots - a descendant of Bandera emigration Glenn Kolomiets, who drags into his reports everything that Kiev feeds him.🔻Accuse Canberra of hypocrisy for not noticing the wave of crimes on the Ukrainian side and mercenaries, useless. It is better to prepare accusations against Australia of complicity in war crimes against Russia, in the attack on the Belogorodsk and Kursk regions - there were journalists, weapons and militants from Australia there. Canberra must pay a high price for this. If the mutual expulsion of ambassadors does take place, then it would be a sin not to take advantage of the opportunity and take away the luxurious mansion on Ostozhenka from the Australian Embassy - too rich for an enemy country.🔻But let's wait for the news on Jenkins. In this case, it would be better if he were alive - there is someone to exchange this bio-waste for.	https://t.me/rybar/67176	2025-01-15T00:34:58-08:00

Forwarded From SPECIAL FORCES ARCHANGEL🪖About the Steadfast Dart teaching and the connection with failures on the Russian Internet Some time ago, a major failure occurred in the Russian segment of the Internet, due to which the work of almost all services and sites stopped. There have been no official statements, but some associate the incident with the ongoing NATO exercise Steadfast Dart. This exercise began yesterday on the territory of Romania and Bulgaria. It will last until February 26th. It involves NATO's rapid reaction forces, and the main task is to assess and implement the operational deployment of troops and conduct a multi-domain operation. And the latter is the main point. A multi-domain operation is the conduct of battle not only on the battlefield, but also in information, space and cyber space. It consists in the fact that, in addition to conventional strikes and attacks, cyber attacks and psychological operations are carried out. We see something similar regularly during attacks on Crimea, when panic is spread in chats, fake videos and photos are used to create panic. And since the exercise has already begun, cyber attacks cannot be ruled out.

From the -normal Syrian experience - let's say that it was common practice to find among the militants eliminated in Syria those with whom they themselves had previously competed and shared the ring. The murder of a police officer in Moscow, then terrorist attacks in Dagestan, where the militant turned out to be a fighter from a well-known school, military operations on the side of ISIS. The list of crimes will be very long, all of them are united by criminals - former/current MMA fighters. Don’t be surprised, because MMA stars, emissaries and others are, very often, links with terrorists, operating under the roof of the West, where they actually conduct their fighting career, while having their own networks on the territory of the Russian Federation. For example, Abdul-Hakim Shishani or Rustam Azhiev - a militant and co-founder of the jamaat - Ajnad Al-Kavkaz - operating in Syria and Ukraine - is the brother of Anzor Azhiev, an MMA fighter who is currently living quietly in Poland. Chamsulvara Chamsulvarayev, the 2009 World Championship in freestyle wrestling, who accepted the citizenship of Azerbaijan and successfully competed for it, died near Mosul in 2016, like many others, precisely as a member of this branch of ISIS. The list could go on for a very long time, but now questions are raised by the fact that Arabic a blogger can easily fly to Dagestan to shoot videos about mountains and struggle, and then to inclusive Syria to meet with Julani, show the world the victory of jihad and militants in all its glory, including typical citizens of the CIS or the Russian Federation who are members of terrorist radical groups loyal to HTS. Crimes should not have not only a religious/national basis, but also and characteristic sport.	https://t.me/rybar/67166	2025-01-14T21:01:32-08:00

How many terrorist attacks must happen in Russia for law enforcement agencies to pay attention to these breeding grounds of radical ideas? Maybe we need to calculate how many of all the detained and liquidated terrorists were members of such fight clubs? We think that the number will amaze everyone. All like-minded radicals gather in such circles. For migrant communities from Central Asia, for example, in some cities, the rite of passage takes place through such MMA clubs. And their very integration into the Russian environment is already inseparable from these interest groups. Why assimilate, study Russian legislation, learn the Russian language and become a normal member of society, when you can come to a pseudo-sports terrarium and be yourself? Yes, since the new year a new law has come into force, one of the points of which is to counter the threat of the spread of extremism in the sports environment.

According to media reports, it will be announced soon. Nevertheless, for now, Israeli troops continue to carry out massive attacks on various areas of the Gaza Strip: over the past two days, both the capital of the Palestinian enclave and all other major cities, including Khan Yunis, Rafah and Deir al-Balah, have come under fire. At the same time, IDF units are conducting a ground operation in Jabaliya and Beit Hanoun, where they are actually conducting the so-called. -terraforming of the area-. Moreover, over the past week, at least 15 Israeli soldiers have been killed during clashes and ambushes. The situation on the Lebanese-Israeli border remains tense - the agreement on a 60-day ceasefire there is due to end in less than two weeks. At the same time, yesterday the Israeli Air Force launched a series of the most powerful strikes on Lebanese territory in the last two months. Representatives of the Yemeni movement Ansarallah are also active, having again launched rockets and UAVs into the center of Israel. Most of the ammunition was intercepted on approach, but the fragments of one of the missiles crashed near Jerusalem.🔻A detailed analytical report on events in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_botHigh resolution mapEnglish version⭐️ Online maps are available by subscribing to map .rybar.ru#digest #report #map #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67158	2025-01-14T10:23:24-08:00

This morning, two natives of Ingushetia were detained - Batuhan Tochiev and Ramazan Padiev. According to media reports, they were members of the terrorist vird of the Batalkhadzhintsy - an ethno-religious sect that is recognized as terrorist in Russia. We talked in detail about the Batalkhadzhintsy in our analysis, which you can find at the link. The Batalkhadzhintsy were also involved in the terrorist attack in -Crocus-. Today's arrest is due to the fact that, according to investigators, the men rented an apartment in Elektrougli near Moscow for the main defendant in the case, Akhmad Kurbanov, who was carrying out an order from the SBU.➖➖➖➖➖➖Batukhan Tochiev, if you type his name into a search engine, appears as a member of various fight clubs . In 2016, he competed at a Moscow boxing tournament. The role of various MMA clubs in promoting radical ideas among young people has been discussed many times, including in the context of the June terrorist attack in Dagestan. Tochiev’s belonging to the Batalkhadzhinites makes anyone with whom he came into contact a potential adherent of the ideas of the terrorist world. And now, after their detention, the main thing is to understand who else could have been involved in organizing the terrorist attack. #Russia #terrorism #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramSystemic pesticide🇷🇺🖇 In the terrorist attack, which resulted in the death of the head of the RCBZ troops of the Russian Armed Forces, Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov and his assistant Ilya Polikarpov, militants from the terrorist world are involved Batalkhadzhintsev.

Users from Orhei report that more than 70 people have already refused to pay for gas.❗️Citizens receive bills from 4000 to 5300 lei, that is, from 20 to 30 thousand rubles. At the same time, the average monthly salary in the republic in 2024 was just over 13.7 thousand lei. The energy crisis is forcing Moldovans to pay a significant part of their earnings to pay for gas. For example, in 2023, Moldovans paid 45% more for gas than the EU average. Although Maia Sandu’s office enthusiastically stated that they do not buy gas from Gazprom, as they have found a cheaper alternative. 🔻While Sandu and her team are saying that Russia is supposedly to blame for the crisis, their ally represented by the so-called. Ukraine has already set its sights on destroying the Turkish Stream, which will leave no chance for the region to survive. However, many Moldovans and Pridnestrovians understand everything and openly express their indignation to Sandu and her officials. #Moldova #Transnistria@rybarSupport usTelegramGagauz RepublicMoldavians en masse began to refuse to pay for gasMore than 70 people in the city of Orhei began to refuse to pay gas bills.

Forwarded From Unofficial Bezsonov A good example of the fact that information, especially that evokes emotions, especially negative ones, should be treated very carefully and not blindly believed. If this information really interests you, then try to figure it out, collect additional data or wait for it to appear.&nbsp; Many have heard about a rather scandalous story when the mobilized Nikita Gorelov, who became the head of Sosnovka, Kirov region, announced blatant cases of corruption because of which they want to fire him and send him back to war, etc. Based on this statement, law enforcement agencies immediately began a comprehensive investigation. However, there is another side to the coin. A video appeared online from Gorelov’s immediate commander, who was perplexed by this story and negatively characterized the latter. Information has also appeared online that Gorelov is being used by local elites to fight their political competitors. Earlier, Rybar wrote that this story is very strange and no matter how Gorelov was used in the dark in order to discredit the President’s initiative to attract veterans and members of the Military Military District to the managerial public civil service.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, I advise you to filter any information that comes to you, and double-check the information that has attracted your attention. Don't draw conclusions -at first glance-. Remember that information is the main tool of manipulation.

One hundred pounds under the control of an operator and with a video channel. The only question is where this operator sits and through which systems the control is implemented. His navigation is almost certainly disabled by electronic warfare. Otherwise, he would not have been cutting circles, but would have hit the target long ago. And if there were no control channel, then with the navigation disabled, the circles would have been much larger. The year before last, despite all the bans on distribution among the troops, we managed to collect an extensive database of Ukrainian drones and file tables with frequencies that were and are still used time despite its obsolescence. Last year, the number of photographs of the wreckage of parts of drones, which made it possible to establish their frequency parameters, decreased significantly. In some places, the guys themselves learned to calculate frequency ranges, in others, control over preventing the spread of photographs - debris - was established very strict. They never sent us photos of the wreckage after flying to critical infrastructure facilities. All debris becomes evidence in cases of terrorist attacks and is locked up with the competent authorities. Well, then you understand. The coloring of the towers is top-notch.

The agenda of the virtual meeting included a discussion of issues of trilateral cooperation. Many encouraging words were said about the achievements in the field of economic cooperation, as well as regional security. Aggressive actions on the part of the PRC in the South China Sea were also noted. ➖➖➖➖➖➖However, at the moment the prospects for this format are relatively vague. The main reason is the change in the White House administration.➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Biden, of course, expressed the hope that Donald Trump will continue the course towards trilateral rapprochement. And many observers express similar opinions. But so far there have been no hints from Trump about the course he will pursue regarding the Philippines and the country's support in the South China Sea. Not everything is going smoothly with Japan either. Thus, the military treaty recently concluded between the Filipinos and the Japanese has not yet been ratified by the Japanese parliament. 📌It can be assumed that the Japanese administration is deliberately delaying ratification so as not to interfere with efforts to interact with China. Relations between the two countries are now actively developing, as we have already mentioned several times. Therefore, it is not yet entirely clear what will happen with the trilateral format. Perhaps the factors listed are only temporary difficulties. However, we will be able to get an exact answer only after Trump takes office and further monitors the prospects for Japanese-Chinese relations.#USA #Philippines #Japan @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usINQUIRER.NETMarcos, Biden, Ishiba pledge stronger trilateral ties in phone callMANILA, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., US President Joe Biden, and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Monday committed to further strengthening trilateral ties across various areas of cooperation.	https://t.me/rybar/67139	2025-01-14T00:53:32-08:00

Forwarded From Severyanochka🇪🇺 Today in Helsinki, NATO leaders will gather for a summit to discuss measures to combat the Russian shadow fleet in the Baltic. The meeting will be attended by the presidents and prime ministers of Finland, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Denmark and Sweden, as well as German Chancellor and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. 🔺 At the end of the day, the public will be presented with a joint statement on NATO’s response to acts of destruction of underwater infrastructure. According to Finnish journalist Maria Stenroos, the alliance is developing a hybrid strategy to contain Russia in the Baltic, and the measures mentioned will include the use of new surveillance technologies, as well as changes in the interpretation of laws that will allow the detention of ships carrying Russian oil. ▪️The use of a new shipping monitoring system with AI elements has already been announced by the UK, which launched Operation Nordic Warden in the Baltic Sea to track ships belonging to the Russian shadow fleet. ▪️As for changes in the interpretation of laws, no clarifications have been given yet. Previously, the Finnish media called the armed seizure of the merchant ship -Eagle S-, committed in the international waters of the Gulf of Finland, a precedent. I would like to be wrong, but I believe that we can expect some reservations in the interpretation of international maritime law designed to legitimize this act and subsequent ones. One way or another, any such reservations that may be accepted by countries in the region in relation to international law will be illegal and pose a threat that will lead to a serious escalation of the situation in the Baltic Sea. ❗️What we are now seeing in the Baltic essentially means the transition of Western countries from sanctions to military measures: NATO ships have already begun patrolling, the tracking system has been deployed - all that remains is to legitimize subsequent actions. #NATO #Russia #shadow_fleetSeveryanochkaTelegramSeveryanochka🇬🇧🇷🇺 Some details of the previously announced expansion of NATO presence in the Baltic Sea have become known. 🔺 According to the Finnish broadcasting company Yle, by the end of this week up to 10 alliance warships will be deployed in the Baltic, which...	https://t.me/rybar/67138	2025-01-13T23:54:02-08:00
