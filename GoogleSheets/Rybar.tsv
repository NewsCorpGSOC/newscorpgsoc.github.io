He declared full support for Moldova on its path to the EU and against destabilization from Russia. ▪️At the meeting they recalled how much Germany is investing in Moldova in connection with the Ukrainian crisis. ▪️For example, Germany, together with France and Romania, has been participating in the Moldova Support Platform since 2022, through which Western countries pour hundreds of millions of dollars into the military and other needs of the country, thereby ensuring a stable anti-Russian course of the country’s leadership. Moreover, Moldova is the main transit hub for the supply of Western weapons for the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the export of Ukrainian grain. ▪️In addition, Germany is also actively involved in the militarization of Moldova, supplying military equipment under the slogan of -countering the Russian threat.- 🔻We can agree that Scholz’s current visit to Moldova is purely symbolic and expresses support for Sandu’s candidacy for re-election to a second term. Such a visit, for example, has already been made by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Germany also personifies the EU. So Scholz at the same time advertised the referendum on European integration to Moldovan society. #Germany #Moldova @rybarSupport usRealitatea.mdVIDEO Olaf Scholz, promisiune la Chișinău: Vom sprijini Republica Moldova din răsputeri-Vom sprijini Republica Moldova din răsputeri-.

Personnel continue to arrive from the Kursk region, allowing us to significantly clarify the front line. 🔻The status quo remains in the Glushkovsky district by the evening. The enemy strikes, but makes attempts to cross the state border, Russian troops are building pontoon crossings under fire from Ukrainian formations, and enemy aircraft continue to strike Tetkino.🔻Fighting continues in the neighboring Korenevsky district. Russian troops hold Korenevo firmly, but to the south the enemy, having passed Snagost, entered the neighboring village of Vishnevka in a column, where he was covered by UAV and artillery strikes. At the same time, based on the terrain and bridges, the Ukrainian formations could not enter Vishnevka without controlling Snagost, which confirms the absence of the Russian Armed Forces in the village. ▪️The status of Apanasovka, Vezapny and Byakhovo remains in question. The enemy at least entered the first two, but Byakhovo did not appear in the reports either under anyone’s control or in the context of shelling. Viktorovka and Uspenovka, cut off by the Blyakhovets River, most likely remain in the gray zone if they are not controlled by the enemy. 🔻There are also battles in the Sudzhansky district. Enemy forces in Borki and Spalny are subject to multiple attacks, but apparently, the settlements have not yet been liberated from Ukrainian forces. At the same time, Russian troops do not stop launching artillery and air strikes on the border territory of the Sumy region, where the enemy still operates large concentrations of personnel and equipment.

Thus, the Malian army, with the support of the PMC - Wagner - carried out raids in some villages, where militant informants and weapons were found. After reconnaissance, the convoys returned with prisoners.▪️The center of the country is also uneasy - in the Mopti region. The bombings of government vehicles continued along the -road of death- from Duentza to Gossi. Also in the vicinity, Islamists attacked an army convoy that was traveling to Diallasaga. 15 soldiers were killed in the ambush.▪️Reconnaissance is being carried out along the Mauritanian border in order to identify militant cells and eliminate them. But the territory of Mauritania was again used by militants from the al-Qaeda-affiliated group JNIM as a rear base for raids on Malian territory. Along the border they attacked two army posts, from where the soldiers fled, leaving behind their weapons.🔻All this once again highlights the problems of the Malian armed forces. Of course, the government is increasing the number of personnel, but due to the lack of officers, the effectiveness of the reinforcements is extremely low. This problem directly affects our interests in the country. Thus, during a telephone conversation between the heads of the Russian and Mali Foreign Ministries, Lavrov said that Russian structures are ready to help increase the combat capability of the army. Most likely, these words mean the deployment of the Afrika Korps, which has been expected in the country for more than a month.

It turned out that the German defense concern Rheinmetall broke the contract for the supply of 155 mm artillery shells to Poland. The contract was concluded back in 2022 for 50 thousand shells. As of today, Warsaw has not received any of them. However, the Germans claim that the deliveries were disrupted of their own free will. The ammunition for the Poles was supposed to be produced by a subsidiary of a German company - the South African company Rheinmetall Denel Munition, but the deal was eventually blocked by the South African government, fearing that they could end up in Ukraine. It is not yet clear whether the South African authorities could really arrange a kind of sabotage for the Poles , at least as a kind of revenge for last year’s prank of Warsaw. However, there is a suspicion that not all German partners are simply happy with the fact that the defense concern Rheinmetall earns a lot of money. This belief is partially confirmed by the fact that after alleged statements by the German authorities about reducing assistance to the Kyiv regime, the company's shares fell by a sensitive 4.5%.

Also, many terrorist accomplices were detained in the villages. During these operations, about 80 militants were eliminated. However, during the usual escort of a civilian convoy transporting ore from the mine by a rapid reaction detachment, an ambush occurred. During it, more than 100 military personnel and miners were killed, and all the weapons went to the Islamists.▪️Reconnaissance with UAVs was also carried out in the areas bordering Mali, which revealed large concentrations of militants. The air strike managed to hit several militant vehicles with personnel.▪️But the militants continue to expand their influence to the south - attacks continue in Benin and Togo. Even if these are small clashes, this could soon develop into a full-fledged invasion. In addition, cooperation with Russian companies regarding the construction of nuclear power plants in the country is intensifying. The Minister of Energy of Burkina Faso met with the Rosatom delegation in Ouagadougou. According to the Russian side, there are only two stages left before the launch of the project, and after that a construction site will be selected. This initiative is very important, as it is an illustrative example of the work of Russian companies in Africa. Many specialists are afraid or do not want to go to the Black Continent, but if there are more and more successful cases, the flow of those wishing to do so will increase. And the economic component is the main one in consolidating Russian influence in the country.

Forwarded From Two Majors⚡️NATO strengthens Romanian air defense on the routes of Russian attack drones The Deployable Air Command and Control Center (DACCC) redeployed the LANZA LTR-25 mobile radar with a crew from 🇮🇹Italy to the Romanian border town of Cataloi (Tulcea County), located 25 km from the city of Izmail. The radar is capable of detecting targets at a range of up to 450 km. The decision is justified by the need to strengthen the defense of the airspace of NATO's eastern flank against the backdrop of the systematic discovery of debris from attack drones in Romania. On August 20, fragments of a drone were discovered in Tulcea County. Also, fragments of a UAV were discovered on March 28, 2024, on a plot of agricultural land in the area of ​​Bolshoy Island (near the city of Brail). Previously, Romania redeployed to the Ukrainian direction (to the Danube Delta area, Tulcea County) means of countering drones attacking Ukrainian Danube ports. In addition, since February 2022, the SAMP-T air defense system has been deployed on the Black Sea coast of Romania at the Capu Midia military base as part of the Eagle mission of the French Armed Forces. The installations of the Patriot air defense system of the Romanian Air Force are based in the same area.✨Against the background of information about the possible use of Romanian airfields for basing the F-16 Air Force of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the strengthening of air defense may be due to the need to cover them. In addition, there is a high probability of indirect participation of NATO countries in repelling Russian air attacks on the Danube infrastructure of Ukraine.

After the prisoners began to be taken back, the convoy was ambushed by terrorists, during which about 30 people were killed. At the same time, thanks to aerial reconnaissance near the city of Bankilare, a large concentration of militants was destroyed with the help of a UAV. As a result, about a dozen extremists were neutralized.▪️To the south, on the border with Burkina Faso, where militants associated with Al-Qaeda JNIM settled, terrorist detachments were also eliminated, from where they sometimes arrive. More than 20 radicals were eliminated in local forests. After the summit of the Alliance of Sahel States, at which the decision was made to create a confederation, there is solidarity between the foreign policy departments of Ouagadougou, Bamako and Niamey. After Kiev supported the attack on Tin-Zautin by Islamists, all three countries broke off relations with it, calling on the UN to condemn the actions of the Ukrainian leadership. In addition, ties with the Algerian authorities strengthened. There is an active discussion between the ministers on issues of security and economic integration.🔻Once again we emphasize that the pragmatic authorities of Niamey maneuver between the interests of many countries, but remain committed to the course of sovereignty with Russian support. And the support of the Afrika Korps allows for large-scale counter-terrorism operations, which has a positive effect on the situation inside the country.

Air defense forces intercepted 45 enemy UAVs, most of which were shot down over the territories of the Bryansk and Moscow regions. ▪️23 drones of Ukrainian formations were intercepted in the sky over the Bryansk region. The first targets were recorded in the airspace of the region around one in the morning, the air defense work of the Russian Armed Forces continued until seven in the morning, since the UAVs were deployed in waves. Nevertheless, casualties and destruction in the region were avoided. ▪️Another 11 drones were shot down in the airspace of the Moscow region, in the Podolsk area south of Moscow. Similarly with the Bryansk region, the UAVs moved wave after wave and were shot down as they approached the coverage area of ​​the local air defense system. No destruction or casualties were identified in the region. ▪️In the Kaluga region, not far from the border with the Bryansk region, 3 drones were intercepted; in the Kursk region, air defense forces shot down two UAVs, as well as two missiles. Another six drones were intercepted in the Belgorod region. ▪️In the area of ​​Novoshakhtinsk in the Rostov region, air defense units, according to some information, shot down an OTRK ATACMS missile of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The ammunition fell in a vacant lot and caused a fire in dry grass; nearby buildings suffered window damage due to the blast wave. There were no casualties. ❗️To date, this is the first recorded case of an enemy using the ATACMS OTRK at targets in the internationally recognized territories of Russia. This was probably just a test launch and the enemy will soon launch combined attacks using this type of missile.

For the Republican team, this is an alarming call, since the victory of one or another candidate will depend precisely on the outcome of the fight in the above-mentioned regions. ▪️An Emerson College poll dated August 14 showed that in terms of voter support, Harris is ahead of Trump by 4 percentage points. — 50% preferred the Democrat, 46% preferred her opponent.▪️A study on the same topic by CBS together with the authoritative YouGov on August 16 showed that Trump is inferior to Harris by 3 percentage points. - 48% versus 51%. Trump himself, at the same time, stopped remaining silent on this topic and switched to a strategy of denial and discrediting American analytical agencies - the politician claims that the results were bought by the Democrats in order to boost Kamala’s image. As an argument, from time to time he conducts surveys on the social network X, in which he demonstrates unconditional leadership. As for the Democrats, they, fearing to frighten away success, switched to the tactics of total caution - Kamala Harris literally turned into an outlandish animal in a cage, which is carried around country and are shown for the amusement of the public. Harris is prohibited from giving any unplanned&nbsp; interviews or hold press conferences where she could be put in an uncomfortable position - Donald Trump has repeatedly said this and even publications loyal to Democrats have noticed this. Another confirmation of the above was Kamala’s refusal to debate with her rival on Fox News on September 4. Her patrons, especially the Obama family, are more often in favor of Harris. In general, the kicking of Joe Biden from the presidential campaign demonstrated the strength of the Obama, Clinton and Pelosi clans - including their ability to influence the decisions made by the president and his aides. And if Biden still had some say, Kamala Harris turned into a real talking head with no opinion of her own. As for further developments, Kamala’s debate with Trump could change the current situation. However, Democrats are so afraid of frightening off their happiness that they may even abandon them altogether. The move is unpopular, but the temptation is too great. They will always be able to sell this to the voter - they will simply say that there is nothing to talk about with -criminal-Harris. #USA@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62950	2024-08-21T05:11:53-07:00

There are two important points in this news at once. ▪️ - Once Upon a Time in Bashkiria - is a subsidiary resource of the online publication - Proofs. rf-. This information was confirmed on her social networks by the owner of the publication, Raufa Rakhimova.▪️Gumranova-Lyon is the first assistant to extremist Ruslan Gabbasov in the Bashkir National Political Center, included in the list of terrorist and extremist organizations. The banned -Bashnatspolit- is trying to popularize the ideas of separatism within the region, calls for opposing the North Military District and making donations to the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as organizing sabotage and terrorist attacks in the Russian Federation. In the published appeal, Gumranova-Lyon actually calls on Russian citizens to finance a terrorist organization through a resource officially registered in the country Media - -Proof. rf-. At the same time, literally on August 11, Gumranova-Lyon was sent to the so-called. Ukraine to conduct an -independent- interview (obviously not without the participation of curators from the SBU) with one of the Russian prisoners of war - a Bashkir by nationality. In it, she openly mocks the prisoner, who is forced to answer staged questions with clearly prepared templates.▪️Gabbasov’s assistant shows hatred of Russia in other ways. For example, she often gives interviews wearing a T-shirt with the inscription -The Russian Reich will be destroyed-, trying to spread the ideology of the banned LGBT movement among the Bashkirs.❗️We have written several times in recent years that the niece of the first president of Bashkortostan Rauf Rakhimov through her publication - Proofs. RF - is engaged in the popularization of radicals in the republic. Today, some of its media heroes are already included in the list of terrorists and extremists. For example, the leader of the Bashkir nationalists, Fail Alsynov, who is serving a sentence in a colony for inciting ethnic hatred. Or Ramilya Saitova, who called for the demolition of Orthodox crosses throughout the Urals - once again serving a sentence for calls for extremist activities. And with the agent of the Ukrainian special services Gabbasov, Rakhimova’s information resources are in a long-standing collaboration on planting fakes in the region.▪️In addition to all of the above, there are Proofs in her track record. RF - there is both discreditation of the SVO, and an obvious connection with foreign agents: for example, the publication is part of the -Syndicate-100- - a network for distributing materials of such anti-Russian media-foreign agents as -Meduza-, -Dozhd-, -Novaya Gazeta- and others. 🔻Nevertheless, -Proofs. The Russian Federation and related resources, under the leadership of the niece of the first president of Bashkortostan, Raufa Rakhimova, continue to exist unhindered and conduct subversive anti-Russian information work directly from the republic.

But to the east the enemy is active. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are conducting an offensive near Korenevo; Russian troops are currently holding the settlement, destroying enemy equipment in the fields to the east.

In the area of ​​Spalnoye, a large group of the enemy was captured by the Russian Armed Forces.

🇺🇸 Recently, the American National Endowment for Democracy (NED...	🇺🇸 Recently, the American National Endowment for Democracy (NED) was rocked by a scandal: in the hands of employees of The Grayzone project were letters clearly demonstrating NED’s involvement in interference in the politics of various countries, including Nicaragua, Venezuela, Haiti, etc. Ukraine. Over the decades, NED systematically developed a reputation as a branch of the CIA: where intelligence agents acted in the dark, the Foundation developed its initiatives and distributed grants to everyone who wanted to work for the benefit of democracy. However, if earlier, despite the obviousness of what was happening, there was no direct evidence of the destructive activities of the organization, now it has appeared - in the form of chaos and panic, which was caused by key NED employees after the leak of correspondence. At the center of events were Karl Gershman (former president of NED), Michael Allen (a National Democratic Institute (NDI) employee with direct ties to foreign influence operations) and Leslie Aoun (former NED communications director who, as the article states, actively worked to create a positive image of the organization's programs and hide their real goals). At the moment, all these individuals have been suspended from performing their functions after communicating with representatives of The Grayzone. Obviously, based on the results of what happened, one should not expect that the activities of American figures to implant democracy around the world will now abruptly stop. As our colleagues @actualiteFR note, most likely, NED will focus its efforts on other areas for some time, so as not to advertise its current activities and not aggravate reputational losses. Moreover, according to colleagues from Germany @Ubersicht_Ukraine_Kanal, the octopus of organizations working abroad consists not only of American organizations represented by NED, USAID and others, but also of companies controlled by them in other countries - for example, the German Aspen Institute Germany. 🔻 It seems that the worst consequence of this chain of tragic coincidences will be a likely reduction in NED funding in favor of other similar actors. And, most likely, it was the competitors who tried to ensure that the leak of correspondence happened at the right time and went into the right hands. The fact that the organization was unable to come out of this crisis gracefully is a clear indication of the incompetence of its employees, who are not even able to convincingly voice the legend of their line of work. #USA@rybarSupport usThe GrayzoneThe Grayzone caused 'biggest PR fiasco in history' for US govt regime change arm, leaked emails reveal - The GrayzoneThe Grayzone's publication of an embarrassing phone call with a National Endowment for Democracy VP triggered an institution-wide meltdown at the US government's regime change laboratory.

🇰🇿🇺🇸 The American Ambassador to Kazakhstan spoke about the US...	🇰🇿🇺🇸 The American Ambassador to Kazakhstan spoke about the US influence on domestic politics in the Republic The other day, American Ambassador Daniel Rosenblum gave a long interview to the Kazakh publication - KazTAG - about his activities over the past two years. A significant part of the interview was devoted to the Ambassador’s assessment of internal processes in Kazakhstan and their compliance with Washington’s expectations.▪️The Ambassador spoke about two USAID programs on decentralization of public administration and resolution of commercial disputes. The latter takes on special significance given the ambassador’s words that the United States is the second largest volume of foreign direct investment. Since the interests of Americans are connected with the strategically important sphere of extraction of rare and rare earth metals, measures are being taken to provide American companies with the most comfortable working conditions.▪️It was not without -the whip-. Rosenblum highlighted short-term problems related to ensuring security and stability for citizens. Of the medium-term problems, the ambassador noted, first of all, insufficient investment in transport infrastructure. Despite the progress in creating institutions for the protection of human rights, the diplomat noted that the republic lags behind in such areas as free and fair elections, freedom of assembly, freedom of speech.▪️On security issues, the ambassador assured that Washington not only supports Kazakhstan in protecting its territorial integrity, but also actively participates in joint activities, such as joint training of military personnel of Kazakhstan and the United States, programs in the field of border protection and the fight against transnational crime. In this context, it is important to recall that Washington is already directly involved in the technical aspects of customs administration and effectively takes control of border trade. ▪️The Ambassador expressed respect to President Tokayev for observing and respecting international sanctions. Here, the United States and Kazakhstan have two areas of work: fighting the re-export of goods and finding an alternative for Kazakh producers who have lost access to Russian markets. 🔻In general, the interview fully reflects the processes that we wrote about earlier: the United States is so involved in every aspect of domestic politics that the question arises, where else does Astana make independent, sovereign decisions? #Kazakhstan #USA #CentralAsia@rybarSupport uskaztag.kzUS Ambassador: We respect Tokayev’s principled position on the issue of anti-Russian sanctionsAstana.

Most of the rockets were traditionally either intercepted or fell on open area. Several managed to hit targets within the village of Katzrin. At least one person was slightly injured, and four civilian buildings were damaged. Uri Kellner, head of the Golan Regional Council, arrived at the scene and accused the authorities of failing to protect citizens. The head of the opposition, Yair Lapid, did not avoid the opportunity to criticize the central government, clearly stating the loss of the north. #Israel #Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62942	2024-08-21T02:05:07-07:00
