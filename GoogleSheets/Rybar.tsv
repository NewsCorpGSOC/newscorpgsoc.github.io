The Kurds, he said, must decide to disband as soon as possible.🖍The words of the Turkish head of the defense department can be understood as follows: -The Kurdistan Workers' Party, if they want peace, should quickly lay down their arms at the mercy of Turkey.🚩However, looking at past attempts to close the ossified problem peacefully, it always ended with the Turks violating the agreements. The last time this led to the start of an operation in northern Iraq.🏳️And now Turkey’s promises are not much different. It seems that many in the PKK are ready to stop the war, it seems that the Turks also need to get rid of the festering wound in the form of the PKK, but nevertheless the Turks continue to hit PKK positions.❗️In the month of March, the number of days when Turkish drones and fighters did not strike the mountainous regions of northern Iraq can be counted on one hand. So does this look like peaceful intentions?#Iraq #Turkey⭐️@rybar💸Support us	https://t.me/rybar/68916	2025-03-18T03:50:00-07:00

Thus, from March 16 to 17, Azerbaijan four times accused Armenia of shelling positions in the eastern and southeastern sections of the border zone, which was denied by the Armenian Ministry of Defense. Yerevan recalled a long-standing proposal to create a joint mechanism to investigate cases of ceasefire violations. However, Baku has still not responded to the proposal, which is very significant. 🚩The practice of recent years shows that Azerbaijanis themselves launch such fakes in order to use them as a reason for their own attack. 🏳️It is significant that new accusations appeared precisely in conjunction with the statement of the Armenian government about the supposed completion of the agreement on the points of the peace treaty. As we wrote, this is simply warming up the Armenian society for the referendum on amending the Constitution in 2026. ❗️In fact, Baku is not going to sign any documents until the Constitution of Armenia is changed. And all this time, the Azerbaijanis continue to pump up their information field with anti-Armenian and anti-Russian propaganda in order to always have reasons at hand for a new escalation in the South Caucasus. #Azerbaijan #Armenia⭐️@rybar💸Support us	https://t.me/rybar/68914	2025-03-18T02:47:43-07:00

The meeting took place in the Chadian leader's birthplace, the city of Amjaras. The French politician emphasized the fundamental importance of French-Chadian relations. She also noted that relations between the former colony and the metropolis are rather cool, calling for their improvement and declaring their intention to listen to Chad. At the same time, internal political contradictions in France itself are rather behind the meeting. In this case, Le Pen wants to show that the Macron administration was unable to keep Africa at bay and, in general, failed its tasks on the Dark Continent.❗️In general, this meeting does not bode well for Chad: it shows that even the opposition (or, as they call themselves, sovereign) forces in Western countries, if they win, will continue the policies of their predecessors, including in the confrontation with Russia on the Dark Continent.#Africa #France #Chad⭐️ @rybar💸 Support us	https://t.me/rybar/68911	2025-03-18T01:04:44-07:00

According to the Gaza Ministry of Health, 236 people have already died as a result of the strikes. Despite the fact that the operation began with the involvement of only the air component, by the morning armored and artillery units along the entire border of the Gaza Strip had joined the strikes. Israeli army aircraft and navy strike the coast, Khan Yunis and Rafah. As Netanyahu stated, -Israel is beginning to act against Hamas, attracting increased military power.- Israeli officials declare that in this way they are going to achieve the return of the hostages. The US administration fully supports these actions, shifting the blame to Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The resumption of bombing became possible, among other things, thanks to the supply of aerial bombs from the United States. Netanyahu has already hastened to announce that the hearings on the corruption case, to which he was supposed to be involved today, must be postponed. However, there is nothing surprising in this: given the general policy of the ultra-Orthodox ruling in Israel, over the past year and a half, any internal political problem has been solved at the expense of an external conflict. 📌 This approach allows you to switch attention for the time being. ❗️ Since the operations of the Israel Defense Forces in Syria have already ceased to attract due attention, activity in the south of Lebanon has decreased, and protests in Israel have been gaining momentum, the question of resuming the bombing of the Gaza Strip was only a matter of time. Israeli far-rights are already waiting for ex-Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir to return to the government, since the deal and truce have been disrupted, and another golden era is now dawning for local nationalists. And naturally, everything will now be blamed on the Palestinians and their disagreement. #Israel #Palestine⭐️ @rybar💸 Support us	https://t.me/rybar/68907	2025-03-17T21:45:53-07:00

Forwarded From Two Majors🇷🇺☎️🇺🇸About the upcoming telephone conversation between Putin and Trump Among the planned topics of discussion, the American leader stated the issue of control over power plants, probably referring to nuclear power plants☢️. In this context, Russia has a significant advantage over the enemy from Kiev🐽. While the Zaporozhye NPP was under Russian control, critical processes caused by the barbaric operation of NAEK-Energoatom, the largest nuclear facility in Europe, with a capacity of about 6 thousand MW, were stopped. The Ukrainian authorities, for their part, have toxic baggage in the form of dangerous experiments with nuclear power plants (increasing the nominal power of nuclear reactors, multiple extensions of the operating life of units, attempts to use inappropriate American equipment and even handicraft parts), which caused constant accidents and incidents. Thus, Ukraine showed a complete inability to safely operate such technologically advanced facilities as nuclear power plants. Moreover, the slow-witted military-political leadership of Ukraine, not caring about the environmental safety of the European continent, moved on to shelling the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant and observers from the IAEA, which forced Rosatom specialists to stop energy production at the station. Repeatedly, these animals hinted at the possibility of creating a dirty bomb and begged their Western masters for nuclear weapons. (❗) The news about the sale of nuclear waste from corrupt Ukraine to some international terrorist organization will not be surprising. Moreover, there is already experience in cooperation between the Main Control Department and the MTO in Mali.✨The proposal to transfer Ukrainian nuclear assets under the control of an international consortium will create conditions for increasing control over dangerous nuclear facilities and materials now in the hands of inadequate Ukrainian Nazis. Otherwise, just take them away by force and monitor their safety yourself.Two majorsTelegramTwo majors☢🇺🇦Against the backdrop of the plunder of Ukrainian resources, which even the French are joining, the issue of potentially dangerous objects remains untouched.

Forwarded From Two Majors Unfortunately, Comrade Rybar, the outflow of personnel from the warring and rear military units and bodies after the abolition of the provisions of the Supreme Decree on partial mobilization (there are only three grounds for leaving service under a contract) is inevitable.✨ Few people mention that there is an impressive category of military personnel whose contracts ended a year or even two ago, they did not sign new ones, but in connection with the SVO continue to perform official duties. And there are only more such deferred reserves. After the gate is opened, a lot of smart soldiers and commanders, front-line soldiers and rear soldiers will leave military service. In addition to financial reasons, which we have written about more than once, this is also the devaluation of awards, -rewarding the innocent and punishing the innocent-. Lack of motivation to serve further after the war. Now it is already a problem to delay the promotion of rising commanders and chiefs due to the clogging of the system, and in the future it will be necessary to almost simultaneously look for new specialists, preferably of at least a lower grade. The issue here lies not only in the plane of monetary allowance and social justice. In general, we need reform not only of the Russian Armed Forces, but also of the entire power bloc, which entered the war in 2022 with peacetime standards and orders, and during 3 years of war produced so many clarifying pieces of paper that few people want to understand this paper-bureaucratic hell.Two majorsTelegramRybar📝Personnel question: about the risks of the outflow of people from the army during the period -after the SVO-📝 Current realities have raised the question of ways to preserve the personnel of the Russian Armed Forces after the potential completion of the SVO, since the likelihood of a mass exodus, judging even from cursory polls, is by no means...	https://t.me/rybar/68896	2025-03-17T05:44:02-07:00

The proposals indicate long-overdue measures, from a serious increase in peacetime pay and official housing to simplifying the transition from civilian to military service and vice versa.📍In this case, it is important not to forget one point: preserving the backbone of the army is not an end in itself, but only one of the necessary components for a radical reformatting of the armed forces, the need for which was revealed by the Northern Military District. And this, in turn, includes the introduction of approaches to recruitment, logistics, document flow, etc. that are already familiar to the civilian sphere. And where the criterion of effectiveness is not photo reports and journal entries. ❗️Someone will say that this is difficult and generally expensive. But the price of such savings can be seen in the example of how, instead of the Crimean scenario, a protracted high-intensity conflict with all the consequences results. And if fundamental changes do not happen, then all the vast experience of the Northern Military District will simply go to waste. I chose 30 opinions from all the massive comments and what came in PM. And I suggest you familiarize yourself with them.

The flight mission has been completed in full, and obtaining a certificate for the engine is scheduled for the fall. In the past, Superjets were equipped with the Russian-French SaM-146 engine. Their deliveries stopped in 2022 due to sanctions, which, coupled with other problems, actually led to the suspension of aircraft production. Today’s event does not mean that aircraft with PD-8 will go into production tomorrow - this is only the beginning of a long stage of flight testing. However, it brings closer the appearance of a conditionally -import-substituted version of the aircraft.🚩Previously, the Superjet was repeatedly criticized for the presence of foreign components. But at the time of its design, no normal alternative was visible: one can recall the competitor Tu-334 with three crew members and Motor Sich engines.❗️Serial production of a technologically independent version of the Superjet is vital: the problems of Russian airlines show that without civil aircraft production in the country there will simply be nothing to fly, and the purchase of old Airbus and Boeing will not be a solution.#aviation #industry #Russia⭐️@rybar💸Support us	https://t.me/rybar/68894	2025-03-17T03:05:12-07:00

The Ukrainian side solemnly announced the modernization of the anti-ship missile -Neptune-. Now, according to representatives of the Ukrainian military-industrial complex, the anti-ship missile system is capable of hitting at a distance of up to 1000 km. 🖍Many people along the entire front line managed to get acquainted with Neptunes during the SVO. At first, the Ukrainian Armed Forces used it for attacks on Crimea, converting it into attacks against ground targets. And then they appeared on other sectors of the front, including even Belgorod. It is too early to say whether Ukrainian engineers were able to increase its range so much. If this happens, then sooner or later they will fly long distances across Russia. However, as a rule, this is an easy target for air defense units. 🏳️However, last year we wrote that Western countries will most likely rely on investments in the Ukrainian military-industrial complex in order to avoid wasting their weapons. And in fact, this happened using the example of the same Neptunes or unmanned vehicles.❗️Now the Ukrainian side is not particularly dependent on artillery, which requires scarce ammunition. They have replacement FPV drones. The shortage of long-range Western missiles is compensated by long-range UAVs and precisely Neptunes. Yes, they are not so effective. But at the same time, they are mass-produced, and the APU can launch them in large quantities.

In general, the position regarding the negotiation process has been that our country needs a long-term sustainable peace, and not momentary satisfaction of Trump’s ambitions.▪️ However, the transformation of the position of Kyiv is indicative, which not so long ago demanded -exit to the 1991 borders-, later it turned into -borders at the beginning of the war-, and now Zelensky is completely and unconditionally ready to try to freeze the conflict on the current LBS, which absolutely does not suit Russia in its new constitutional boundaries. In addition, a pause in hostilities is always in favor of the retreating party.▪️ Meanwhile, the United States has resumed the transfer of intelligence and military-technical assistance to Ukraine, and European bureaucrats continue to disperse military hysteria and military preparations for entering the war with Russia. The latter is expressed in measures to expand the Armed Forces of Poland and Germany (including through the expansion of territorial defense and general military training), as well as the deployment of military production, the owners of which receive colossal super-profits.▪️At the front, the success of the Russian Armed Forces in the Kursk region creates the preconditions for the development of the situation in the Sumy direction. At the same time, the Armed Forces of Ukraine were preparing for such a development of events and preparing the frontiers in the Sumy region. In the Belgorod direction, the enemy daily terrorizes civilians, hitting them with artillery and drones. In the Kupyansky direction, counter actions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces were reported on our bridgeheads on the right bank of the river. Oskol. In the Krasnolimansky direction, the Russian Armed Forces remain active in the direction of the settlement. There are wells near Yampolovka. On Seversky, our troops are moving with heavy fighting from Belogorovka to Grigorovka. The Armed Forces of Ukraine continue to send personnel and equipment to Dzerzhinsk (Toretsk), the battles for the agglomeration continue. To the north of Vozdvizhenka there are battles in the Tarasovka area: the Ukrainian Armed Forces have erected extensive strongholds. Near Krasnoarmeysk (Pokrovsk) there were oncoming battles all week, and by the end of the week they reported that our troops had regained the initiative. North-west of liberated Constantinople, ours are leveling the front, moving west. In the Komarovsky direction, the Dneproenergy was taken. On the Zaporozhye front, the capture of Pykhatki and Stepovoy, located to the north, became important; there are battles for Shcherbaki and Malye Shcherbaki.✨ Thus, it is extremely premature to perceive politicians’ talk about peace as a signal for an imminent ceasefire. This is the job of politicians - to make statements and provoke their opponents into mistakes, to lead him by the nose and deceive him. It is important to understand that in addition to the regions enshrined in the Russian Constitution, the previously declared Russian cities of Odessa, Kharkov, Nikolaev, Dnepropetrovsk and even Kyiv, if the Kyiv regime is not completely dismantled, will remain under the control of Russia’s enemies, which will be a source of constant threats to our country. In addition, communication with front-line soldiers who have been fighting in the most difficult directions since the beginning of the war forms an idea of ​​​​the moral readiness of the Russian Army to continue to fully achieve the goals of the Special Military Operation.

The goal is to send a warning signal to Iran, with which Trump wants to conclude a nuclear deal. The very fact of the start of a military operation against the Houthi movement - Ansarallah - was expected. Israel needs intensification of hostilities in the Middle East, and Trump’s conditional half of his cabinet are supporters of the ultra-Orthodox ruling there - Chabadniks. Since coming to power, Trump has declared Make America Great Again, but if we evaluate all his recent actions (transfers of 2000-pound bombs, the resettlement of Palestinians in Africa, and so on), we get Make Israel Great Again. At the same time, the prospects for the American operation in Yemen looms doubtful. Every strike against the Houthis will be very costly. How much will the US Armed Forces spend if the fighting drags on for a long time? And, knowing the Houthis, they will definitely drag on.❗️The US has already tried to suppress Ansarallah by force, and then it didn’t work out.

In this case, the Ukrainian authorities are actually trying to project their recent diplomatic failure in the White House onto the Russian Federation. The goal is to force the Trump administration to return support to the so-called. Ukraine, like in the old days.🖍The problem with such attempts is that even the United States hardly seriously counted on success with the truce in its current form. Rather, in this way they were more testing the waters regarding the firmness of the Russian position. Many things happening now - be it public statements, demonstrative decisions and outright bluff - are part of the diplomatic process, where the parties are trying to achieve better conditions for themselves. So there will be a lot of information noise in the near future, but it will influence the negotiations between Russia and the United States less than it might seem.

The words of the Hungarian leader confirm the militant statements of European bureaucrats who talk about the rearmament of Europe, support for the so-called.

He also mentioned the possibility of restoring relations with Russia in the future. The words actually reflect the positions of the current American administration. Considering the role of the United States in the organization, the remaining members can only stomp their feet in disagreement, but accept this as a fact. It is premature to see here a step towards Russia - a written document refusing to accept the so-called. Ukraine is not in NATO. You don’t need to go far for an example - you can remember the promises about the -non-expansion of the Alliance to the east.- Moreover, nothing prevents you from simply withdrawing the document, as the United States did with the Iranian nuclear deal. So guarantees on this issue alone are no longer sufficient today, as Russian officials say. At the same time, the event is a slap in the face to the Kyiv regime, which has enshrined its aspirations for NATO in its constitution.

Ukraine, said Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. He made this statement at a meeting in Ankara with Turkish President Recep Erdogan, who is trying his best to become a mediator in negotiations on the Ukrainian conflict. Well, or at least somehow participate in the process: but at the moment, the United States is showing no special favor to either the Turkish or European authorities. And now Tusk is asking Erdogan to take on as much joint responsibility as possible for the peace process and security guarantees in the European region. 🖍From a historical point of view, the situation is more than interesting: the Poles, as frantic Catholics, constantly opposed Muslims, and now they come to them for protection from other Christians. Although, in principle, Warsaw has always neglected the old principle - be crazy where it is appropriate -. On the other hand, it is obvious that the Poles fled to Turkey not by chance. In their clear conviction, the Americans are soon planning to withdraw their troops from both Turkish lands and Polish territory. And in this situation, Warsaw will remain completely alone in the face of the very threats from the Russian Federation and Belarus, which the Poles have been shouting about for years now.❗️As a result, this dubious idea, in which the Poles suffer from their own aggressive and inflammatory actions, can somehow work only in one case: if someone allows it.#Poland #Turkey⭐️@rybar together with @pl_syrenka💸Support usTelegramWarsaw mermaid Proud and eternally dissatisfied Poland without embellishment: not tolerant enough for the EU, not too democratic for the USA, too conservative for the other world.

GLSDB presents the GBU-39 aerial bomb with a jet engine, adapted for launch from HIMARS and MLRS installations. The range of use reaches 150 km, making them an alternative to ATACMS with more modest characteristics. Although such deliveries always add a threat, there is no wunderwaffe there - of the entire line of the American high-precision weapons, the Russian Armed Forces have not yet encountered only JASSM and Tomahawk. And the same ATACMS launches have not happened for a long time, which indicates limited reserves. The measure is a US response to Russia’s refusal of the current version of the 30-day truce. Moreover, yesterday in Washington they also did not extend sanctions exemptions for Russian companies.❗️However, negotiations will continue, and with such actions the parties will try to strengthen their position.

Moscow has long stated its position more than once: a truce is possible, but only on specific conditions, with the prospect of long-term peace.

For example, under the pretext of the need to monitor how carefully local businesses care about the environment.❗️ This means that in Europe they no longer intend to waste money and want the green stuff in Central Asia to finally begin to pay for itself. #globalism #EU #CentralAsia #Uzbekistan #economy⭐️ @rybar💸 Support usUzDaily.uz Financing of environmental initiatives in Central Asia was discussed in Tashkent On March 11, a High-Level Policy Dialogue was held in Tashkent: expanding financing and investment to achieve environmental goals in Central Asia.&nbsp;	https://t.me/rybar/68813	2025-03-13T07:31:27-07:00

Most are waiting at home for families: children, wives, parents... Military personnel protect their relatives and the possibility of a peaceful life for them on the line of combat contact every day. It is rare, but it happens that the whole family ends up in the military service, having made a conscious and final conclusion about this need: siblings and cousins, fathers and sons, husbands and wives perform military duty together. But what to do when the family is forced to be on the front line - because there is simply no other choice? Special forces soldier Isa Gadzhiev had to look for an answer to this question: following his friends, he went to defend his homeland in a special military operation, and at that time in Dagestan his daughter was born, about whom he dreamed so much.

🔁 On the effectiveness of missile strikes Noteworthy are the...	Forwarded From Two Majors About the effectiveness of missile strikes Noteworthy is the difference in the enemy’s work in terms of covering or hiding information about the results of missile strikes by the Russian Armed Forces against rear targets of Ukraine. Thus, when hitting really significant targets, incl. hotels or other premises of foreign mercenaries, a set of measures is being taken to conceal the real consequences. Cordon rings are put up, cellular communications and the Internet are jammed, measures are taken to detain civilians taking photographs: legislation was tightened by Kiev after the start of the war, people receive real sentences and are accused of working for Russia. The reasons for this were the inept actions of the same State Emergency Service of Ukraine, when corpses in foreign military uniforms and symbols of the Armed Forces of NATO countries were found in the footage of destroyed hotels. When empty targets were hit, the opposite trend was observed. Thus, local authorities and units of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine coordinate photographs with enemy counterintelligence before publication and, moreover, it is on its instructions that such publications with photographs are carried out. With this, the enemy pursues two goals: ▪️Demonstration to the world community of the consequences of flights to supposedly peaceful targets; ▪️Satisfying the needs of decision makers in Russian intelligence in terms of obtaining confirmation of the defeat of the target (the enemy has long studied the slide report-photo from the scene). By doing this, the enemy expands the capabilities of this category of reconnaissance officers to continue wasting expensive missiles on empty targets. This technique is called -distraction by an unusable object.- As an argument, we suggest you think about how many photos from the Oreshnik arrival sites the enemy published on his own. Stop thinking that the enemy is stupid and doesn’t know how to play operational games. This is the fourth year we've thrown our hats.

Forwarded From Warsaw Mermaid🇵🇱🇺🇸☢️ If I fall asleep and wake up in a hundred years and they ask me what is happening in Poland now, I will answer: they are asking for a nuclear weapon in order to become the first in line of suicides. Only under Duda do the Poles ask for nuclear weapons every year and more than once. And here 2025 has already been going on for three months, and they haven’t started yet! We need to fix it, of course.🔻And less than a month ago, the Poles started talking about, scary to say, their own nuclear weapons program. But, of course, it is not feasible at the moment. And it is unknown how fate will turn: what if someone shakes a test tube and argues about the need to break into Poland. The previous US administration refused to the Poles, citing the fact that Washington does not intend to place nuclear weapons in countries that joined NATO after 1997. Poland joined the alliance in 1999 along with Hungary and the Czech Republic. They say there is no trust. Then the Poles offered to give them at least strategic bombers that can carry nuclear weapons. They say that the United States stores up to 20 bombs at the Büchel airbase in Rhineland-Palatinate Eifel in Germany. There are also Tornado fighters who must use their weapons in emergencies. And after all, Germany does not even border on the main threats to Europe - the Russian Federation and Belarus. It didn’t work either.📌However, it must be taken into account that ideas about possessing nuclear weapons or returning to compulsory military service fuel nationalist sentiments and obviously influence public opinion, especially among those who are scared of a terrible and evil Russia. In the short term, this could increase pressure to increase the military budget or even overhaul defense strategy. #NATO #Poland #USA #army@pl_syrenka - Poland is not a foreign countryTelegramV Z - VIEW.RUThe President of Poland called on Washington to place American nuclear weapons on Polish territory.

This is not a clear sign of refusal of a truce and negotiations, but from an information point of view it is timely and what is needed.📌Yes, sometimes we remember about signals and even send them. I would, of course, like to see them done more often, but still. 🔻Other messages are also important: ▪️the attitude towards captured Ukrainians as terrorists continues the line of a clear association - Ukraine is a state of terrorists. This does not mean that someone will be -washed in the toilet-. This only means that, firstly, these prisoners are not subject to exchange, and secondly, the degree of responsibility and conditions of detention will be comparable to terrorists. The key here, however, is precisely the message about the terrorist nature; ▪️the phrase about -thinking especially about the creation of a security zone along the border is also an excellent hint both at the continuation of operations in the Sumy region, and the targeted diversion of enemy forces to this section of the front;▪️the number of 600 military personnel who were involved in Operation Truba is the real number of those who were able to ensure the success of the breakthrough of the operation. Roughly speaking, this is the composition of one BTG, which radically resolved the issue with the entire Sudzhansky district. And this is important for understanding the real scale of the number of warring units in the war of ultra-small groups.❗️ In general, such a timely visit by Vladimir Putin on the day of the liberation of Sudzhi, and even in military uniform, is an extremely effective and striking political move.

🔁 Kursk region and lessons for everyone about territorial defens...	Forwarded From Two majors, Kursk region and lessons for everyone about enemy territorial defense units✨ At the very beginning of the war, many people, including those in high uniform, did not even know what territorial defense was. I had to explain, tell what it was. This, according to the definition, is a separate branch of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is entrusted with the organization, preparation and execution of territorial defense tasks. That is, within the boundaries of their own under-country. Before the war, crests enrolled in it in order to receive extra hryvnia from the state. Sometimes they went to exercises, but still, selection and monitoring of the population’s mobility readiness was carried out there, the best were selected to be included in the lists for mobilization in special forces. They lied to people that they would defend their own cities and villages. As a result, Kyiv, as expected, deceived its own people. TrO brigades, as we see, are now not just within their regions or even under-country, but even in the Kursk region. Archangel of Special Forces about today's prisoners: - servicemen of the 156th separate battalion of the 118th separate territorial defense brigade (OBr TerO) from the Cherkasy region, who, according to the prisoners, did not even know where they were being sent -. Slavery Ukraine about the prisoner: - Denis Karyakin, builder by profession and a slave by life, born in 1982, from Cherkasy region, Vatutino. 88th about 106th brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, was captured on March 4 in one of the forest plantations of the Kursk region. Rybar: - Even at the moment when Russian troops were advancing in the vicinity of Malaya Loknya, we said that the enemy carried out a rotation, withdrew units of the 95th brigade from neighboring settlements, and in their place brought in territorial defense units and busified mobilized ones - Let us note that in the Kherson direction, they were forcibly transferred from the 126th brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to the Ukrainian Marine Corps. Since the time of Krynok.✨Conclusions: ▪️If the residents of Ukraine were not slaves, and the EU countries were not like the Reich, they would have sued international courts over Kiev’s failure to fulfill the terms of the contract with the state. It sounds funny, but still. Relatives of the victims can. Look, they will be obliged to pay a penny for a dead person.▪️Currently, European countries are taking the same measures as Ukraine once did: in Germany🇩🇪 a territorial defense division is being created, in Poland the army is being increased to 500 thousand, including at the expense of the same reservists. That is, Europe is preparing for war.▪️The post-war structure of the remnants of Ukraine should be such that Kyiv will never again be able to -hide- the size of the army in the defense.

Even before the so-called SVO. Ukraine lost a fifth of its population, and taking into account the widespread emigration and losses afterwards, it actually lost long-term demographic prospects.

There is no need to expect adequate punishment - in the new Syria, the murder of Alawites is not considered a major crime, as the previous days have shown. And they were arrested by the same people who themselves most likely participated in the purges. The demonstrative action was taken into account by the international community. In addition, self-appointed President Abu Muhammad al-Julani received a reason to rein in potentially dissenting militants, using the incident as a pretext.❗️And then members of HTS and other groups will continue to do the same thing, just in a more orderly and less public manner. Moreover, among them, most likely, there will be those who were now so demonstrably detained. #Syria #terrorism⭐️@rybar 💸Support us	https://t.me/rybar/68767	2025-03-11T23:45:50-07:00

When necessary, they immediately negotiate successfully. To his own benefit. But with all this, Marco Rubio’s words that the ball is in Russia’s court should be taken as a kind of part of the protocol. While the proposals will go to Russia, while in Moscow they will look at them and remind them of the terrorist nature of the Ukrainians, who decided to organize the most massive raid on the day of the negotiations. ❗️With all this, one simple truth must be taken into account. If for us ending the conflict on our terms is an existential question, then for the West it is an opportunity to earn points and hang up the tag of a peacemaker. Therefore, it is not worth falling for exhortations about peace: at the first opportunity they will forget about peace.

This time, Navalnists are collecting data from students who disagree with the Russian authorities, who are invited to some super-duper secret forum for the very best. Only super-talented, maximally politicized and very charged people will be selected for it after they... hand over all their data to scammers from FBK. At the same time, the obvious dubiousness of the initiative has already been pointed out even in the most opposition environment, they say it’s better not to get involved - it’s a dangerous matter. In this context, we are forced to agree: FBK organizes such projects quite often, and given their media hype and any kind of popularity Alexei Navalny - the output has always been at the level. However, the problem is that all these developments in fact turned out to be criminal schemes, with the help of which extremists simply collected personal data of their own supporters for further resale or even surrender to intelligence services. For example, the foreign agency - Alliance of Teachers - openly admitted to transferring data of Russian teachers to the SBU and Western journalists. They motivated this by the fact that the information had already leaked onto the Internet, and the teachers suddenly turned out to be -occupiers-, unworthy of cooperation with the Navalists.📌And there were a lot of such -trade unions-FBK created, as well as projects like -Smart Voting-. Well, even to sell Navalny’s book, they collected personal data, and it was in Russian and through a certain server, and on the same Amazon you could simply buy the publication.❗️With a very high probability, this FBK project is aimed at collecting information about Russians - with only one main goal: to harm them in the future. #Russia #extremism ⭐️@rybar together with @pezdicide💸Support usTelegramLife of insects Meanwhile, the FBK sect began to cancel Adagamov for the fact that he gave the only practical advice regarding their next murky project (forum of young talents) - not to participate in it in order to avoid criminal cases.	https://t.me/rybar/68752	2025-03-11T09:52:40-07:00

The terrain is mountainous, which made it convenient for covering the militants.🚩Currently, security forces and local authorities are trying to contact the passengers. Police and ambulance squads went to the area from nearby Mushkafa and Sibi. The militants themselves have not yet put forward conditions. 📌Separatist activity in Pakistan is commonplace, but in the last six months the Baloch have increased their terrorist activities. Last year, a train carrying military personnel was blown up. The growth compared to previous periods is 119%.❗️The Government of Pakistan can do nothing about this. They do not have the strength to carry out a large-scale operation, the economy is in a terrible state, and the population is split into two camps - some are in favor of the current leadership, and the vast majority are against.

Let’s leave aside the perverted logic of the Ukrainian leadership - for it, carrying out terrorist attacks and deliberate strikes on residential areas are in the order of things. And in the status of a collective monkey with a so-called grenade. Ukraine has long been rooted. Another thing is important: if the enemy directly says that in this way he is trying to force out a partial truce, then he is really afraid of Russian strikes, confirming problems with air defense. In these conditions, attacks, on the contrary, need to be increased while there is an opportunity. At the same time, let us repeat what has already been said: demonstrative massive raids on residential infrastructure mean that the Kiev regime views partial truces only as a pause before a new round of escalation. And in the context of negotiations, it can be noted that if you talk to someone using the so-called Ukraine, then certainly not with representatives of the Ukrainian quasi-state entity: it is more expedient to confront them with a fact.#Russia #Ukraine ⭐️@rybar💸Support usTelegramBefore everyone else.

This is another example of how civilian weapons (which law-abiding citizens can legally purchase) can save lives even in areas remote from the front and eliminate the public danger. It is even more surprising to read messages that it was wrong to destroy the drone, so the weapon should be taken away from the person. They say that firing a gun at an enemy UAV flying towards Moscow could create a danger. Let us carefully note that a fired air defense missile or a machine gun burst from a CTF is actually much more dangerous than a shotgun shot. And it’s even more dangerous when an enemy UAV with a mass of destructive elements flies into a house and kills people like in Domodedovo.❗️We really hope that the citizen will be encouraged and not punished. Otherwise, people will develop the confidence that in all such situations it is better to do nothing, because what if something happens. And what this ultimately leads to can be seen in the example of the massacre on the Syrian coast.

The anti-leaders in terms of the number of offenses were St. Petersburg, Moscow and the Moscow region. But similar problems are observed almost throughout Russia. The authorities are trying to combat this: in some regions, restrictions are being introduced on the work of migrants on public transport and taxis. And in some places the situation began to improve: for example, in the Magadan region the number of accidents involving buses became 2 times less, and the number of victims decreased by 78%. Taxis have stopped getting into accidents altogether. You can’t fool the statistics: these numbers clearly demonstrate that restrictive measures and regional policies are capable of solving seemingly systemic problems. All this raises such a simple but very important question: if there is a positive experience, it leads to stabilization of the situation and an improvement in the quality of life, so maybe it’s worth resorting to? We already live in difficult times.

Forwarded From Special Purpose Channel This afternoon, Comrade Rybar wrote about another episode of the fighting in the Black Sea, namely the battle for one of the platforms in the sea. However, there are a number of inaccuracies that I would like to point out. It is not the Special Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine that participate in the raids on the towers, but various units of the Main Intelligence Directorate, which Budanov riveted. Such power steering raids have been going on for a year now and have different objectives. First of all, guided by the main principle of the head of the GUR, his charges want to provide a media component, so they strive to either capture the tower and take prisoners, or inflict maximum damage. All these attempts are repelled by the Black Sea Fleet with the support of naval aviation. Second point. Rybar writes that the GUR, having landed on the platform, arranged a photo shoot and left. Which is also fundamentally wrong, during the next raid there was a full-fledged battle, the enemy, having received a rebuff, retreated. However, with a 101% probability this will all continue. We will also point out to Rybar another error in his material. In his post, he used photos of the power steering, which were taken on the platform -Crimea-1-, which is the sister-platform -Crimea-2- for which there is red tape between the Budanovsky offspring and the Black Sea Fleet. We published these photos back on March 7, but they were most likely taken even earlier, since the enemy regularly sits in Crimea-1, so they are not related to the latest events.@okspn	https://t.me/rybar/68732	2025-03-10T11:37:58-07:00

He was recently fired from the post of assistant to the rector of the Dagestan Humanitarian Institute for international activities - the Muftiate of Dagestan also stopped all cooperation with him. 🚩As it turned out, Huseynov used his official position for selfish purposes.

Forwarded From Balkan Gossip Fisherman: The silent horror from the footage from the Mediterranean coast in long-suffering Syria brings to mind the terrible footage from the Bosnian villages of the 90s and leads to certain thoughts devoid of optimism. When I talk about Serbian settlements in the suburbs of Srebrenica... As for militants from the Balkans in the ranks of HTS (former Al-Nusra), I have already described in detail how several years ago a whole detachment of Albanians (mostly Kosovo) was formed in its ranks. So, just so you understand, the leader of the Albanian group, Abu Qatada al-Albani (in the world, Abdul Yashari), received the rank of colonel in December and a good position in the -transitional government of Syria- (or whatever the new -respected partners- should now be called?). An ethnic Albanian originally from Skopje, Yashari has been a close adviser to al-Julani for many years. In the summer of 2014, he headed the military operations of Jabhat al-Nusra in northern Syria, at the end of 2017 he joined the committee that resolved the conflict between Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and al-Qaeda, and in 2019 he was even honored to lead the negotiations. Since then, the Albanian has enjoyed undeniable authority among Middle Eastern Islamists. Channels for recruiting young Muslims from the Balkans and sending them to Syria have been established since 2015, and much more of them went to jihad for combat experience than you can imagine. The proportion of Kosovo Albanians recruited, for example, is eight times higher than those from France. Basically, the Al-Nusra front was replenished by young people aged 20 to 35 from rural areas, poorly educated, without professional experience and skills. As a rule, unemployed. At that time, only about 10% had military training or experience - guerrilla warfare - in the ranks of the separatist UÇK (Kosovo Liberation Army). A few years later, many returned to their homeland as full-fledged militants and began to form Islamic radical communities. According to operational information, today the Albanian Lesnica, Zagoracan and Pogradec can be considered hotbeds of radical Islamism in the Balkans), the Bosnian villages of Oshve and Gorne Mace, the municipalities of Zenica, Tuzla, Travnik and Bihac, the fun of which was added by migration centers built by Europeans, as well as Sarajevo, beloved by tourists. In the self-proclaimed Republic of Kosovo, radical cells are located in Pristinai, Kacanik and Gnjilane, in North Macedonia - in Aracinovo, Kumanovo and Gostivar. Let's not forget about the south of Serbia, inhabited by Albanians, including the so-called Presevo Valley. If you put the settlements I have named on the map, I assure you, you will be greatly impressed. @balkanossiper - we have been setting world trends since June 28, 1914	https://t.me/rybar/68719	2025-03-10T02:06:02-07:00
🔁 Silent horror from footage from the Mediterranean coast in lon...	Forwarded From Balkan Gossip Girl The silent horror from the footage from the Mediterranean coast in long-suffering Syria brings to mind the terrible footage from the Bosnian villages of the 90s and leads to certain thoughts devoid of optimism. When I talk about the Serbian settlements in the suburbs of Srebrenica, which Bosnian Muslims, with the help of mercenaries from the Middle East, literally cleared shortly before the events later recognized by the efforts of Western NGOs and the world press - the genocide of peaceful Muslims - you must understand that approximately the same thing happened there. Whole families killed on the threshold of their homes, bloody massacres with songs and hooting on the eve of Orthodox holidays, mutilated children with teeth pulled out and an Orthodox cross carved on their stomachs. In light of everything that is happening, I think it is important to recall that the picturesque villages of mountainous Bosnia and Herzegovina remain a nest of radical Islam to this day. And among the animals that are right now creating chaos with impunity in Latakia with the tacit approval of the world community, there are many people from the Balkans (from Central Asia, by the way, too). During the bloody Bosnian War, a stream of Islamic volunteers poured into the Balkans: radicals came from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Turkey, Algeria, Afghanistan, Egypt, Sudan and Syria to help their Bosnian brothers in the fight against the infidels. They were supplied with weapons by wonderful Turkish -charitable- and -humanitarian- foundations. With outside support, a detachment called El-Mujahiddin was created in Bosnia under the command of a close associate of Osama bin Laden. The battalion, consisting of foreign mercenaries (mostly Arabs), became widely known for its brutality, massacres of civilians and the beheading of Serbian prisoners of war on camera (still a novelty at the time). They spared neither women, nor old people, nor children. In the occupied territories, strict religious rules were introduced, forming communities living according to Sharia law. The first parajamaats were subsequently formed on the basis of training camps in Mehurici and Zenica near Travnik. After the signing of the Dayton Peace Accords, foreign fighters were supposed to leave Bosnia within 30 days, but they did not. Few people know, but one of the first Islamist suicide attacks in Europe can be considered a performance in Rijeka in October 1995, when a mercenary blew himself up in front of a police building. After the war, more than a thousand terrorists remained in Bosnia. What did they do after the active stage of the conflict ended? The formation of the so-called white al-Qaeda. At the same time, many radicals subsequently received not only Bosnian passports, but even citizenship of Germany and Austria, which became a kind of hub for terrorists. What about the state? The political elite in Sarajevo not only failed to take any action to prevent the spread of radical Islam. She helped him in every possible way. Support was also provided by eminent fighters for democracy and human rights, who are now telling us how to live. For example, during an audit at USAID, it recently became clear that almost half of the amount allocated for Bosnia (which amounts to millions of dollars) was simply lost. It’s not in the reporting, and that’s it. Meanwhile, in terms of USAID investments in the Balkans over the past four years, Bosnia and Herzegovina has taken an honorable second place. But the visible financial flows of the organization were limited only to the promotion of sexual perversions and the launch of media projects. And in parallel, USAID supported parajamaats and Bosnian organizations associated with global terrorist networks. But, of course, not the Anglo-Saxons alone. Let us not ignore the colossal role of the Gulf countries, financing in the region not only the construction of mosques and the educational activities of madrassas, but also the promotion of radical movements. @balkanossiper - we have been setting world trends since June 28, 1914	https://t.me/rybar/68718	2025-03-10T02:06:02-07:00

Forwarded From Two Majors#Summary for the morning of March 10, 2025▪️ In two full days of a large-scale offensive operation, the Russian Army in the Kursk region managed to achieve significant results. Malaya Loknya, Loknya, Nikolsky, Lebedevka, Kositsa, Pravda, Martynovka, Kubatkin, Viktorovka, Staraya Sorochina, Cherkasy Porechnoye were liberated; in the morning they reported the capture of Makhnovka near Sudzha, where the retreating enemy forces were being gathered. In Sudzha itself there are battles on the outskirts. A number of settlements were taken thanks to a maneuver in the pipe - our attack aircraft walked a dozen kilometers in a narrow space and, appearing in the rear of the enemy’s battle formations, began fighting, sowing panic among the enemy. Until the main forces arrived, the assault groups fought surrounded, waiting for ours to break through. Taken n.p. New in the Sumkoy region, roads are under fire control, bridges are destroyed. The enemy is not allowed to retreat. The task is not to squeeze out units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, but to completely defeat and destroy them. The decisive push and the hardest bloody battles, together with long advance preparations, yielded results; the beginning of this ongoing operation will go down in history. ▪️ At night, several unmanned aerial vehicles were destroyed and suppressed in two districts of the Voronezh region.

The problem is that about half a million Syrians, mostly Sunnis, are concentrated in Iraq, many of whom sympathize with the Giuliani regime and the new authorities - the inclusive government - of Syria, which are continuing the bloody massacre. 📌Our Iraqi contacts confirm: the streets are restless, and Syrian migrants are treated in much the same way as migrants from Central Asia are treated in Russia - like a time bomb. Therefore, Iraq, which 10 years ago was a classic failed state, is now seriously concerned about security issues and is preparing for the forced deportation of Syrians in order to prevent destabilization. The situation in Iraq is a litmus test that shows: the problem of supporters of radical Islamism is the same for everyone.❗️Iraq, with its difficult history, is tightening migration controls.

Forwarded From Witnesses of BayraktarI searched for a long time, but never found statements by Russian Muslim figures regarding the events in Syria. I expected to read the following: -Muslims strongly condemn any act of genocide. A true Muslim will never harm women and children. Anyone who uses religion to justify massacres has nothing to do with Islam. How did the massacres in Syria begin? Mosque imams called for the massacre of Alawites and Shiites. Local gangs grabbed weapons and went to the coast in order to put an end to the infidels forever. The genocide continues to this day. Why is this important for Russia? Yes, because our situation is similar to the Syrian one. Most of our Muslims are Sunnis. Frail minds open the Internet and see the execution of women and children amid cries of -nusairiyah, nusairiyah-.- Then they see statements from Syrian spiritual leaders who justify all this. What if he believes them and starts looking around. And suddenly it turns out that thousands of Nusayris live in Russia. In Derbent, Shiites live in a fortress, and in a neighboring house an Azerbaijani, a Rafidite, runs a vegetable shop. I am very afraid that some crazy person will go to deal with the infidel on Russian soil. In Syria, terrorists get away with everything and we may have followers. It’s good that the overwhelming majority of Russian Muslims cannot stand this terrorist rhetoric. There are a huge number of Muslims fighting in the Northern Military District, who are fighting for Russia and, at the first opportunity, will destroy the terrorists who raised their hands against women and children. But still, I would like more specifics from spiritual leaders. You have enormous authority and are in your power to eliminate the slightest doublethink in the current situation.

Another question is that nurturing radicals usually does not end well - and dear Europeans would do well to remember this. As for the White House, their reaction to the Syrian massacre is another reason not to buy into painting their faces with ashes and broadcasting about traditional values.

Later statistics appeared for recent years: of the 792 families, about 20% of those who received documents were from Central Asia and Transcaucasia. Despite the fact that the share of Russians and other indigenous peoples in the city’s population is more than 95%. Local authorities reacted to the indignation of people in an unusually clumsy manner - they publicly threatened those dissatisfied with a prosecutor’s check of the comments they wrote on the subject of -inciting ethnic hatred.- However, the Investigative Committee got involved again: its head, Alexander Bastrykin, promised to check the issuance of certificates in Khabarovsk. Previously, the department had already responded to similar episodes in Nizhnekamsk and Mytishchi, and in the latter case, a violation was identified.❗️Against the backdrop of how it is increasingly difficult for families to get their own housing, the distribution of certificates to yesterday’s migrants looks mocking and provokes social tension.

Forwarded From Two Majors#Review #Summary for March 9, 2025▪️ The main event at the front was the beginning of a large-scale operation of the Russian Army to liberate Sudzha in the Kursk region. With a decisive throw and a daring maneuver with a passage through a gas pipe, our units cut through the defenses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, surrounded Martynovka, raised the flag in Cherkasy Porechny, took positions in Kubatkin and Kositsa, and started fighting in Sudzha itself, where the enemy is trying to retreat from all directions. It is symbolic that through the same pipe through which ours passed to the enemy, gas previously flowed through Ukraine to Europe, for the transit of which Kyiv received a percentage even during the war. Our offensive was preceded by heavy preparation: bridges, communication centers, repeaters, and UAV operator stations of the Ukrainian Armed Forces were knocked out; ours were looking for oxygen cylinders for operations in conditions of lack of air. It is still very early to talk about complete success; there are heavy bloody battles, but the enemy’s defenses were crushed to a considerable depth from several directions. ▪️ The international situation is characterized by the confrontation between supporters of peace and war in Ukraine. Trump’s actions to limit supplies to the Armed Forces of Ukraine do not mean anything now: Kyiv has enough reserves for many months, and the defending side does not really need armored vehicles. The same burning Abrams and cheap FPV drones showed themselves in comparison. It is noteworthy that the ban on the transfer of intelligence from the United States is being sabotaged by European NATO members. In general, the EU has shed the guise of a lover of ecology and liberalism, is going somewhere to find $800 billion for the Armed Forces of Ukraine and is preparing in full force for a war with Russia. The Wehrmacht Bundeswehr is planned for a major expansion, the Polish Army will also be increased multiple times, Macron has generally agreed to discuss the use of nuclear weapons. ▪️ It is likely that it was the position of France and Britain, which have interests in the Odessa region, that became the reason for the nightly attacks with Geraniums and missiles on the region. London is trying to completely seize the operational control of the Ukrainian troops, and being a fan of wars at sea, it promotes the commander of the Ukrainian Navy, supplies Kyiv with means of delivering amphibious assault forces and other support for operations on the water. ▪️ In other sectors of the front, the Russian Armed Forces also continue to put pressure on the enemy. A new bridgehead is being created on the right bank of the Oskol River south of Kupyansk (previously ours united bridgeheads to the north). In the Seversky direction, heavy fighting is already taking place west of Belogorovka. Bloody battles in Chasov Yar, ours are attacking in the Western microdistrict. At the same time, the Ukrainian Armed Forces skillfully use our mistakes and hasty - beautiful reports -: this week it was reported about the passage of enemy forces to Dzerzhinsk (Toretsk). In addition, Kyiv threw reserves at Pokrovsk, villages south of the city changed hands several times. Andreevka and Konstantinovka were liberated. The zone of control is expanding far to the west and north of Velikaya (Bolshaya) Novoselka. On the Zaporozhye front, heavy battles continued for the same Pyatikhatki and on the approaches to Shcherbaki. The Kherson direction is characterized by counter actions in the floodplain of the river. The Dnieper and the Ukrainian Armed Forces tried to land the DRG at the Antonovsky Bridge, but ours completely destroyed the small enemy landing party. ▪️ Enemy UAV attacks on our refineries continued. Some governors still have debris falling, but in general, the Russian Army has formed effective air defense units in a number of directions; nothing other than sloppiness in organizing enemy drone breakthroughs to rear targets cannot be explained. Apparently, no one has ever been held responsible for the burned containers with petroleum products and damaged equipment. ▪️ In the Bryansk, Belgorod, Kursk, Zaporozhye, Kherson regions, as well as in the DPR, the enemy continues direct targeted terror with drones and artillery strikes on civilians. The actions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine make us think about the prospects of the so-called. -truce- and what will happen if the front stops. Donbass observed the effectiveness of the international forces to end the conflict through the example of the OSCE Special Monitoring Group, which, as it unexpectedly turned out, throughout the years of confrontation in Donbass simply transmitted data to enemy intelligence services.

Trump's efforts have led to an increase in European military preparations and threats to use nuclear weapons by France. Under current conditions, the Ukrainian Armed Forces, even without the expected increase in supplies from Europe, are capable of conducting organized combat operations for months. Mobilization processes in Ukraine do not stop, which has not yet led to the loss of combat effectiveness of enemy units. The enemy is accustomed to operating in conditions of a shortage of people and in semi-encirclements, trying to gain time to prepare more and more new lines, while on the current LBS it causes damage to the advancing Russian Army. The only thing that can affect the course of hostilities is a total, complete and comprehensive cessation of funding, supplies, military supplies and the transfer of intelligence to Kyiv by all countries of the world. But military-industrial corporations and Western officials who are fed are directly interested in these processes. So, in general, the topic of ending the war is another deception of Western forces and is extremely harmful to the moral and psychological state of our front-line soldiers. The Russian army is the only force that creates conditions for long-term reliable peace and providing Russian politicians with a strong position in the international arena.

Those same shots of the destruction of the Ukrainian Armed Forces column in Sudzha, apparently, record the very same enemy formations that are retreating from Martynovka in the direction of the piece of iron. It is premature to say anything about the control of Martynovka. The enemy is also retreating from Malaya Loknya towards Cossack Loknya. There they suffered very much. Units of the 106th Airborne Division are already rolling into Cossack Lokni from Lebedevka. Everything is going to the point that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are stretching from there to Sudzha itself, where battles are already taking place not far from that very infamous Pyaterochka. This is approximately the north-west of the city. The settlement of Kositsa near Cherkasy Porechny is also no longer under the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The offensive continues. UPD: supplemented from the field. The column is still not from Martynovka, the Special Forces -Akhmat- represented by the battalion -Pitersky- and -Chechnya-Akhmat- have not yet allowed anyone to get out of there. Martynovka is still under enemy control. All the equipment of the eastern part of the Sudzhi agglomeration and, accordingly, Mirny, Bondarevka, Dmitryukov, Makhnovka, Zamosc - was blocked due to the explosion of all the bridges. The equipment in almost all of this territory was destroyed, and the enemy infantry was also destroyed.

Such smiling guys from Central Asia slaughtered thousands of Alawites, Christians and Shiites in two days. Anyone who did not agree with their religious views was ordered to be destroyed. Yes, they did not act alone. On the coast they were helped by pro-Turkish groups, which were nurtured and protected by the Turkish army for many years. Congratulations to everyone who made cunning plans and hoped to buy the loyalty of the new rulers of Syria for a couple of contracts. These people didn't come to close the mortgage. These militants are building a new world where you have no worthy place. With the snap of a finger, their followers will carry out a massacre on the streets of Paris, London and Moscow. Everything is clear with the Europeans, let them go to their future, where their children will pay jizya (tax on non-believers). After this massacre, we must make our civilizational choice. Either we fight against these non-humans, or... I don’t even want to think about the alternative. I repeat once again that it is impossible to come to an agreement with terrorists; you will never be equal to them. No matter how much money you pay, nothing will make them change their minds. Any dollar you send will be returned to you like a machine gun. Stop seeming like good guys. We will either take a clear position and defend our interests, or we will lose everything. Time to make our choice. Alexander Kharchenko	https://t.me/rybar/68672	2025-03-08T11:00:40-08:00

Ukraine📝Ukrainian and Western media have found the main reason to explain the potential failures of the Armed Forces of Ukraine at the front: it turns out that it’s all about the suspension of US military assistance and the exchange of intelligence information. Time reports that hundreds of members of Ukrainian formations have already died. After all, earlier there was a group of Western officers in the General Staff who helped process satellite data, but now there is no one left. In fact, attempts to blame everything on Trump’s decision look stupid. As we have already written, the really noticeable consequences of reducing American support will not come for the Armed Forces of Ukraine immediately, but only after some time. From an information point of view, this is completely funny: after all, the same Western media reported that the US contribution to the so-called assistance. Ukraine is not decisive, and the share of weapons is only 20%. I just want to ask, what happened?❗️But what it actually has an impact on is the decline in the morale of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: the realization that such help will no longer come hits the enemy in the trenches harder than it seems from the outside.

Now, after the appearance of relatively high-quality footage, it became clear what such rumors were connected with. The fact is that when the shooting began, local residents, mostly women and children, came out in droves from all the surrounding villages. It was they who asked for asylum at the base, and judging by the fact that a field kitchen was deployed in the airport building, the women and children received it. Meanwhile, filtration measures continue to take place in the surrounding settlements, accompanied by a large number of casualties among the local male population who did not have time to escape.	https://t.me/rybar/68628	2025-03-07T13:29:49-08:00

The current authorities of Damascus wisely used the asset in the form of journalists and numerous activists, who almost immediately began to put a lot of information into the media space, talking about what was happening. Moreover, both propaganda and relatively objective ones. 🚩This especially contrasts with the official media of the times of Bashar al-Assad, when during the militant offensive on Aleppo, the media reacted with stingy text statements and speeches by elderly generals with calls not to believe anyone except official information.🏳️ By the morning, numerous rallies were organized and announced in support of the current authorities in various cities. It goes without saying that a considerable part of the demonstrators participate in such events for financial reward, while others were simply intimidated. ❗️In general, Abu Muhammad al-Julani and his team took advantage of the chance so kindly provided by the organizers of the Alawite uprising and successfully passed the test of resilience.

And I thought that toll roads were paid for by the ministry; over the course of 24 years I drove there 19 times. Yesterday they called all the drivers and said that they had received fines for not paying the toll on this road... the fine for not paying is 10k + 1200 fare, they hang 213 thousand rubles on me.

Forwarded From Global Studies🇮🇷🇷🇺🇺🇸 The events in Syria have very significant echoes in the context of relations between Iran and the Russian Federation. As everyone has already perfectly understood, they are once again trying to drag Russia into the conflict between the new authorities and the Alawites, who themselves allowed the current events after they decided to lay down their arms last fall rather than fight. And one of the leading roles in this incitement The conflict between Russia and the new authorities is played by pro-Iranian networks of Telegram channels, which persistently demand the intervention of the Russian Federation. This is despite the fact that the Iranians have already disowned the Syrian confrontation. Why is this important? This shows how diverse the Iranian elite is. In Iran, there are those who advocate cooperation with the Russian Federation and Russian mediation in negotiations with the United States, and there are those who categorically do not want this and are trying in every possible way to resist it. These same supporters of total interaction with the West, after the coup d’etat last year, condemned the Russian Federation, declared betrayal on our part, and so on. They spoke similarly when Israel struck. And this position resonates with many Iranians. Despite the fact that Masoud Pezeshkian came to power, he is too weak. He was a compromise figure in Iran, which suited both conservatives with the security forces and Western-oriented reformers, such as Javad Zarif. Now the conservatives/security forces began to remove the reformers, removing the Minister of Economy under the pretext of failures in their field. And, of course, the latter begin to fight back, for example, trying to pit HTS against the Russian Federation again. And we think that this is just the beginning. #Iran #Russia #Syria Global Studies - subscribe to the channel	https://t.me/rybar/68621	2025-03-07T10:17:02-08:00

Members of the -gang- (in the second photo) visited Russia, met with employees of the Russian embassy in Romania and, worst of all, published on social networks lists of recipients of grants from USAID.✨The paranoia of the Romanian puppet -deep state- reached unprecedented proportions, standing in front of the threat of secession from NATO countries⚡️, which plan to use Romania🇷🇴 as cannon fodder against Russia🇷🇺. ✨⭐️And, of course, the very idea that some sensible intelligence agency would spend public funds, their own time and effort on a gathering of crazy grandfathers who decide to change power in their country at the next drinking party looks ridiculous.

Forwarded From Tribaltic Extinctions🇫🇷🇱🇹What is a -small country-? -One whose existence can be called into question at any moment; a small country can disappear, and it knows it. Against the backdrop of loud statements from the city of Paris, such materials in Western editorials look very interesting. The authors directly write that against the background of Trump’s behavior and the security crisis in Europe, the countries of the latter are again divided into two camps - Western Europe (for which Russia is not such a problem) and Eastern Europe (which, if there are problems with Russia, will be the first to suffer from it and will drown for increasing defense spending to the limit). Moreover, Eastern Europe in the new realities may split into two more camps - those who can afford to climb under the nuclear umbrella of France (for example, Germany), as well as any Lithuania, for which France will not risk a nuclear war with Russia. The possibility of sending European troops to Vilnius is also mentioned in the article with a certain touch of illusoryness, and even with the attitude: well, Putin likes to shed Russian blood, Europeans can easily live to be 80 years old, is there any point in taking risks? Of course, we will immediately win if we send troops, but still!.. If we were the Baltic countries, we would step up - especially in light of the non-invitation of the authorities of these provinces to the recent summit in London.

We answer: in everything.🖍Druze, Christians and Kurds have a lot of options. And not all of them are negative. As a result of the mixing, there will be much fewer Alawites, but they have a chance to survive. As an ethno-confessional group - for sure.🚩There is no one to support the Alawite uprising. ➡️Israel acts only in its own interests and, at best, will minimally support the Druze endeavors, but where there is a common border. And even that is not a fact, because propaganda is one thing, but the relationships among the Druze of Israel, Golan and Suwaid are three huge differences. — ➡️Saudi consistently opposed Assad, including because he is an Alawite kaafir, not to mention a bunch of other reasons. The existence of Alawites does not bother them. ➡️The USA will not go into Syria for the sake of the Alawites, they are already sitting in the Trans-Euphras region among the Kurds and do not know grief. And Israel received huge supplies of air bombs and other cargo. ➡️Israel has had a chance to increase territories for a long time, and they are successfully implementing it. They don’t care that Alawites are being slaughtered 200 km away, they will only applaud. Maybe they will do a couple of airstrikes in support of HTS - like during the conflict in the Lebanese Hermel area.🏳️And Russia doesn’t have a side now. We cannot be more Syrians than the Syrians themselves. Although right now they are TRYING TO MAKE us a party to the conflict VERY HARD.

Two South Korean Air Force fighter jets, during joint training with the Americans, mistakenly dropped eight bombs on the city of Pocheon, located in the northern part of Gyeonggi Province. The military claims that one pilot incorrectly entered the coordinates of the place where the shells were to be dropped. It’s not entirely clear with the second one, since the data in his fighter was entered correctly. The training was aimed at dropping bombs at the same time, so he may have immediately repeated the actions of the first pilot. As a result of the incident, 15 people were injured. Several buildings, including residential buildings, were also damaged. 📌The problem of military activity of both the American and South Korean military often worries not only the residents of the affected Pocheon, but also the entire Gyeonggi province. There are about 380 testing sites in the region - 85% are located in the northern part of the province. Residents, for example, complain about the noise of military equipment due to frequent training exercises. Since the incident resulted in casualties, in order not to raise the level of discontent and panic among residents, the South Korean military has already announced the cancellation of live firing at the upcoming Freedom Shield exercise.

The crests have attracted a lot of people to the city, and are trying to achieve as large territorial gains as possible, at least in the media. They seem to be shouting to European investors that they say, -Look, we are still strong, we can still do it, don’t stop supporting us, we are not a written off asset yet.- And they are being played into their hands by the borrowed inhabitants, like the same Dzerzhinsk-Toretsk. Due to the difficult situation and the fairly expanded gray zone, more than one or two more similar - canned - products may be opened. And the fact that the Russian media, clumsily trying to cope with the anti-crisis, uploads videos with reflections of attacks, which only confirm the penetration of the Ukrainian Armed Forces deep into the occupied territory, is very significant. (Regardless of the relevance of the video, posted right now it is read as fresh). However, regardless of the current events in Dzerzhinsk, this will not affect the general situation too much; in the best case for the enemy, assault operations in adjacent areas will be slightly delayed. But the heirs of Felix Edmundovich still have to work on Dzerzhinsk. Too many questions arise.

🔁🖼 🇩🇪How the destruction of the German economy creates threat...	Forwarded From Two Majors🇩🇪How the destruction of the German economy creates threats to the security of Russia This country, previously the locomotive of the European economy, has been stagnating for the second year in a row. Germany's GDP fell 0.2% in 2024 after falling 0.3% in 2023. According to the Institute of German Economics, every fourth company does not update its equipment, a third of enterprises do not plan to do this in the future, and every fifth entrepreneur in Germany is thinking about closing or moving their business outside the country. Such pillars of the economy as the steel and chemical industries, mechanical engineering suffer the most from the sabotage actions of politicians. In this situation, the only ones who benefit are military-industrial companies that earn excess profits from the growth of military budgets and supplies to Ukraine, which German leaders organize for them. A striking example of this is Rheinmetall, whose capitalization, according to Comrade Rybar, has increased more than 9 times in three years. It is significant that one of the main shareholders of Rheinmetall is the transnational corporation Blackrock, in whose German branch the future Chancellor Friedrich Merz worked. He has already announced paying attention to the military sphere and the need to create a unified European army to confront Russia. On March 4, Merz announced the preparation of amendments to the constitution (❗) to free defense and security spending from restrictions on budget spending. These actions are fully consistent with the recommendations of the Institute of World Economics in Kiel (IfW) to get Germany out of the economic crisis through increased military spending by increasing public debt. This is expected to have an impact on the socio-economic sphere, which is already slowly but continuing to deteriorate. German readers acknowledge declining living standards and increasing uncertainty in the economic outlook. ✨Obviously, the German elites decided to start another military conflict to overcome crisis phenomena and the impasse of political institutions. It seems symptomatic to cite the example of the IfW of Nazi Germany (❗), which, according to his assessment, was able to prepare better than its opponents for the Second World War by increasing borrowing for the army. Well, the gradually impoverished and dumbing down population will willingly believe in the need for a new war against Russia, as it was in the 30s and 40s of the last century.

The device was shot down by a surface-to-air missile over the province of Hodeidah. This year, this is the first American UAV intercepted over Yemen. The event occurred after statements by the Houthis, who threatened to resume military activity because of Israel’s decision to block the supply of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. Ansarallah has already announced its readiness to continue the operation to restrict shipping to Israeli ports. The destruction of Reaper also coincided with another recognition of the Houthis as a terrorist group by the US authorities.❗️This is also the first UAV shot down after the appointment of Trump: the politician is jealous of trampling on US positions in the world and the topic of protecting Israel, and a reaction to this episode will clearly follow.

This also leads to an increase in social tension: when Tatar, Russian or Bashkir families see how, instead of supporting the indigenous people in need, money is given to yesterday's migrants of a characteristic appearance, then their trust in the authorities goes down. 🚩It is characteristic that this happened in Tatarstan - it is from there that the clowns from the Spiritual Administration of Muslims (SDM) take their roots, who approve of the importation of migrants and the paraphernalia of Islamic radicals, feeling at ease even after all the scandals.❗️In general, remembering the fraud that was revealed in a similar episode in Mytishchi, it would be possible to check the legality of issuing a certificate in Nizhnekamsk: perhaps there, too, fraud on the part of Tajik recipients will be revealed. #multinationalism #Russia #Tatarstan #Tajikistan⭐️ @rybar💸 Support usTelegramAndrey MedvedevIn Tatarstan, in Nizhnekamsk, a certificate for an apartment was awarded.

Ukraine intelligence?📝 CIA Director John Lee Ratcliffe said that the United States has stopped supplying intelligence to the so-called. Ukraine. However, the Financial Times noted that Washington still shares them with its allies, including Britain. The latter actually means that there is no complete cessation of the transfer of information - it would be very naive to believe that the British will not forward the information they receive to the Kyiv regime. However, the Americans could well limit the flow of information by providing their allies with only part of the most necessary data. It is quite possible that this is exactly the scenario that was implemented.🚩Nevertheless, the decision can be revised as quickly as it was introduced: as we already wrote, for now Trump intends not to punish the so-called. Ukraine, but to receive a picture of Zelensky’s repentance and a signed resource deal in order to present it as a personal victory.❗️As for the effect, what happened will have a serious impact not immediately, but after some time.

Archangel spoke about this last week, we would like to give a small update. We confirm that the planes flew to Minsk Mazowiecki from Saint-Sauveur airbase in France. The 1/2 air defense fighter squadron - Sigon - of the French Aerospace Forces Combat Aviation Directorate is located there. That's where they are now. Moreover, they have already been repainted and prepared for the Ukrainian Air Force. Like the F-16, the French Mirage-2000F became part of the 107th separate air wing. However, one, the Mirage, was already over Ukraine and even landed there for a day. He was transported to the air base in Ivano-Frankivsk in order to shoot a demonstration video, a frame from which was noticed by our Telegram channels. In general, we get the following situation: the Air Force of Ukraine currently has 37 fighters in combat readiness: 34 F-16s and 3 Mirages. 32 American planes and three French ones are now in Poland, and two -Efki- - in Ukraine.

According to the latest information, it was 35.6%. Taking into account the average daily flow as of March 3, it should be at the level of 33.29%.🖍At the same time, despite the fact that now the situation can be assessed as generally stable, one cannot ignore the fact that no effective pipeline will be able to actually fill Germany’s storage facilities this year, as has always happened since about mid-March. 🚩At the same time, the German government does not comment on what is happening, and data shows that the country’s industry produces practically nothing and has reduced consumption.🏳️Taking into account all the information provided by German colleagues @analytik_news, we can safely draw a conclusion about both the predictability of the situation and its man-made nature. However, what you definitely shouldn’t do is fall into populism and claim that the insufficient filling of gas storage facilities is the cornerstone of the crisis in Germany or some kind of apogee. ❗️Storages are needed to level out seasonal and daily uneven consumption, so their level of occupancy is simply part of a multifaceted crisis into which Germany is sliding deeper and deeper.

Previously, the company was banned in China, Australia, Brazil and Britain. In the B.East, PwC had $2.5 billion a year (this is 26% of annual revenue). The reason for the cancellation was endless manipulations with reporting. And China has generally prohibited its state-owned companies from contacting the Big Four auditing agencies in order to avoid the leakage of sensitive information to the West. It is no secret that Big Four is an intelligence tool for the Anglo-Saxons. 🔻And only in Russia PwC (as well as three other large auditors) simply changed their name to Trust Technologies and continued to work quietly. But no one is chasing them. Also, the British Argus has not gone anywhere - the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation still uses the data of this agency for its calculations. Argus simply moved the team to Astana. Well, it turns out that Interfax news agency has contracts with the US Department of Natural Resources, Dun &amp; Bradstreet (works for US sanctions agencies) and Palantir (area of ​​interests - from AI, mass surveillance tools to military technologies).

Forwarded From Global Studies🇷🇺🇺🇦 Many Russian channels are now spreading the good news that the Americans have suspended military assistance to Ukraine. This, of course, will affect the capabilities of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, if this is true, but there is a nuance. For the Ukrainian side, supplies of components for drones are now more important. And they receive them almost non-stop. Do you think why the number of ships calling at the ports of the Odessa region has sharply increased? And here we agree with the Older Edda. This US measure will not affect the main weapons used by Ukrainian formations here and now. Drones have flown and continue to fly. And the same can be said about BeKs. Tonight from 1.30 to 1.52 at the Portovoye - Steregushchee line in the north-west of Crimea, 6 FPV drones were used from 2 BeKs. There were no losses or gains. 2 fell into the sea, 1 crashed near the position without damage, 3 was shot down by small arms fire. And the BeKs themselves went west. So the war continues, and so far the enemy clearly does not intend to surrender. #Crimea #Russia #UkraineGlobalistics - subscribe to the Telegram channel Older than Edda If the Americans really stop supplying weapons to the Ukrainian, then this will not greatly affect his capabilities in drone production and drone production.

Forwarded From Older Edda Alexander Kots very correctly writes about the fact that even the entire stop of American military assistance will not deal a fatal blow to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. If the Americans had stopped supplies in 2023, it would have been the end of the Ukrainian Armed Forces; now the main strike force, especially in defense, is attack drones and crests make them themselves. The cessation of American military supplies, in theory, should stop the offensive operations of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, or reduce them to purely tactical counterattacks, but on the defensive, even without greatly saturating the advanced combat formations with manpower, the enemy can fight. Yes, the enemy will not have Khaymars, Atakms and a large number of artillery shells, our rear will feel calmer, and the assault troops and reinforcement groups will be fired less often. However, the enemy will be able to isolate the area, just as he will be able to destroy our strongholds and dugouts. All this is now being done by drones, which in this regard are much more effective than classical artillery. The EU will continue to supply shells, with armored vehicles of course everything is worse there, but Europe hopes that the Armed Forces of Ukraine, although bleeding and losing hundreds of thousands of people, will be able to hold out for the time that Europe needs to promote its military industry, and in America by that time the next election cycle will approach, which will give Washington the opportunity to reconsider Trump’s decisions on Ukraine. Therefore, we just need to fight, beat the enemy, and not rely on the foreign policy factor. Telegram Kotsnews How long will Kyiv last without help from the United States?

Forwarded From Sex, cartels, Frida Kahlo🇺🇸🇲🇽🇨🇦Today, 25% duties on imports from Canada and Mexico came into force - and in addition to them, 20% was imposed on Chinese goods. A few hours before this monumental event, Donald Trump said that all three countries had not taken sufficient measures to stop the flow of fentanyl and its precursors into the United States. China responded immediately: additional duties of 10-15% were announced on some American imports from March 10 and export restrictions were introduced for certain US entities. The restrictions mainly concern agricultural products. Previously, Canada promised to respond with similar tariffs if the American tariffs persisted for 21 days. Next they promise to hit bourbon, beer, wine, household appliances and orange juice. The Prime Minister of Ontario announced his readiness to stop nickel supplies and the transmission of electricity to the United States. We are waiting for action from Mexico, while President Sheinbaum suggested remaining calm and waiting. While American farmers are clutching their heads - despite reasoning in the style of eat cake - sell domestically -, they still remember how in Trump’s last term they lost billions due to exports restrictions, and now the situation is even worse. After all, the local economy still depends on cross-border supplies for the processing of agricultural products, the production of cars and equipment.

All these statements are related to the thesis that Europe can no longer rely on NATO protection and must achieve independence from the United States. 🚩But considering that before this, everything that was possible was taken out of European weapons warehouses for the Armed Forces of Ukraine, it will cost a pretty penny to arm the EU again.

News recently appeared: -KazMunaiGas plans to sign a contract for the development of the Mugodzhary oil and gas field (Aktobe region of Kazakhstan) with the American corporation Chevron and the British Shell by the end of this year. ❓Geological research is still underway, but the deputy chairman of the board of the national company of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Kurmangazy Iskaziev, is already in a hurry to build a promising site. And not just anyone, but the largest corporations, which in the 90s took about 80% of Kazakhstan’s oil from three main fields - Tengiz, Kashagan and Karachaganak. However, this plan may not work: for example, the Kalamkas-Sea and Khazar shelf areas (with proven recoverable reserves of 67.6 million and 31 million tons of oil) did not suit either Chevron and ExxonMobil, nor Shell. After this, the Kazakh authorities tried to attract British Petroleum, but the British corporation’s priorities in 2020 were to reduce oil and gas production and increase investment in low-carbon projects. ❗️As a result, in 2024, the Russian Lukoil took up the production project on these shelf areas on a parity basis, purchasing half of the shares of the Kalamkas-Khazar Operating company for $200 million. Therefore, if the profitability of Mugodzhara does not seem sufficient to Western investors, Russian partners may try to attach it - and on much more favorable terms for Kazakhstan. #Great Britain #Kazakhstan #USA⭐️ @rybar💸 Support us	https://t.me/rybar/68512	2025-03-03T23:11:55-08:00

As recent revelations have shown, such assistance from USAID - for reforms - turned out to be ineffective, and in some cases even destructive.

Moreover, as we wrote earlier, in the textbooks of secondary and high schools, certain words are not just erased, but also replaced by others: -Ottoman yoke- and -Ottoman slavery-, not to mention genocide, turn into -Ottoman rule- or -presence-. 🚩As a result of the efforts of the pro-Western government of Bulgaria and their interaction, including with Western universities, which, of course, take part in writing new educational materials as authoritative experts in history, young Bulgarians have the impression that Bulgaria in some incomprehensible way liberated itself.❗️But in all this tragic production there was also a place for a comedy scene. According to the latest educational trends, Bulgaria was liberated by an ethnic international of Finns, Romanians, Poles, Hungarians, Belarusians, Russians and - attention - Ukrainians.

In reality, after three and a half years, the OTG is turning into a full-fledged bloc, welded together economically, culturally and in a military sense. Three and a half years is a fairly short period of time that was required to outline the contours of Turkish NATO, which aims to oust Russia from Transcaucasia and Central Asia. 🖍Today, few people realize the real threat from the OTG: in Russia, odes are traditionally sung to the Turks, the Russian population travels in tens of thousands to a country that sponsors terrorism, the domestic administration does not dare comment on the antics of the Turks and Turks, and meanwhile tension is growing. ❗️If you don’t now start to soberly assess what the OTG project, invented at one time by Richard Moore, head of Mi-6, will result in, then soon the contours of the Turkic world will not only become a reality: a systematic expansion into Russian territory will begin.

Since December 2024, Ukraine🐽 has thwarted several attempts to rotate IAEA observers along the route through the front line to the part of the Zaporozhye region controlled by the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The group was bombarded with artillery and mortars, as well as attack drones, meaning the operator could clearly see the organization's flags. The organization believed that by moving along such a route, it did not violate Ukrainian laws and, instead of gratitude, received from the pigs🐽 a spit in the form of obstruction of activities involving a risk to life. Now, according to Bloomberg, IAEA delegations are rotating through Russian territory🇷🇺, which actually legitimizes Russian jurisdiction over new entities on the part of the agency. It is significant that Ukraine agreed to the deployment of observers provided that the personnel will travel to the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant and back through Ukrainian-controlled territory. The Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already sent a note of protest to the IAEA leadership, condemning the violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state.✨The inadequacy and inability of the Ukrainian military-political leadership is gradually reaching individual officials of Western countries.

Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said that the so-called. Ukraine will not receive money until Zelensky comes to the United States in peace. And the newly-minted FBI head Cash Patel promised to arrange an audit of the funds allocated to the Kyiv regime. Although such rhetoric has not been heard from Washington before, so far it all comes down to promises of modest measures of influence. Although the pressure will increase if Zelensky maintains his position, the question is how quickly the process will proceed.🚩So far, it seems that the White House wants not so much to punish Zelensky, but to force him to defiantly come to bow and publicly repent for his outburst, showing the greatness of Trump.❗️From a political point of view, this logic is not without arguments.

Ukraine - about 200 thousand Ukrainians who entered the United States potentially face deportation from the country. The situation is similar with Russian political asylum seekers, of whom there are approximately 18 thousand in the States. The basis for deportation may be the slightest error when submitting information or failure to appear at the immigration service. This looks like harsh measures, especially in the context of Zelensky’s failure in Washington. However, here the problems facing the United States are the same as in the case of the deportation of other migrants: saying does not mean doing. Even technically organizing mass deportations is not easy - you can calculate how many flights are needed to remove such a number of people. Yes, the same Ukrainians are not the first to leave in comparison with the same illegal immigrants from Latin American countries.🚩Immigrants from the so-called. Ukrainians are quite capable of getting lost in the United States, as hundreds of thousands of other migrants do. It is difficult to catch them due to a lack of personnel, and illegal immigrants can live quietly in the United States for decades. At the same time, some may not bother trying to hide. Unlike other migrants, Ukrainians have somewhere to go - Europe still calmly accepts them as refugees.❗️So for now, such statements are more of a media story.

The Druze declared their distrust of HTS and their readiness to defend the area; in response, the militants blocked all exits from it.🚩 While the elders are trying to resolve the conflict, a delegation has even arrived from Es-Suwayda. Its head has already promised a speedy reduction in tension and reported on the allegedly domestic background of the conflict. Against this background, the reaction of Israel, where a large Druze community also lives, looks curious: the IDF threatened to hit the forces of the new regime in the event of an assault on Jeramana. This coincides with the Israeli plans to support the Druze in Es-Suwayda. Regardless of further developments, what happened again shows that Syria remains a powder keg.

The ongoing international political crisis raises concerns about a possible new adventure by Zelensky to demonstrate his ability to resist the Russian Army. It is important to realize that even in the event of a complete cessation of supplies from the United States and Europe, the Armed Forces of Ukraine will be able to conduct an organized defense using old reserves for at least another six months.

Forwarded From Two Majors#Review #Summary for March 2, 2025▪️ The show in the White House organized by Trump and Zelensky became the most resonant event of the last week and is a sign of the redrawing of the political map of the planet by the world elites. Behind-the-scenes directors transfer the Kiev regime to fully provide for the EU countries, and Zelensky’s visit to London directly points to a new main interest in the continuation of the war. It is significant that all Western European bureaucrats expressed support for Zelensky after the disgrace in Washington, and he arrived on a visit to the UK. No less remarkable is the wording in which the British issued aid to the Armed Forces of Ukraine that day: for the general public it was called a loan, although everyone clearly understood that Ukraine was never going to pay its debts. In general, there is a transfer of control of the Ukrainian colonial troops from the United States to London, which does not do much for the Russian soldier on the battlefield. But so far, assistance from the states has not stopped. Military analysts count the number of cargo planes in Rzeszow, Starlink satellite communication systems continue to operate in the Ukrainian troops, and no information has been received about the recall of American military advisers.▪️ Against this background, the unexpected fraternization with the Americans in the media trenches and the media is somewhat surprising, as if for the last three years it was not the American HIMARS and ATACMS flying over our positions, but those burning in the Kursk region -Abrams- was conveyed by some other country. ▪️ In addition, the predicted reaction of European bureaucrats, who are closely sitting on percentages of funding from Ukraine and military-industrial corporations, indicates plans to increase assistance to the Armed Forces of Ukraine from the EU. This will happen at the expense of silent European taxpayers, who are being turned into duped Ukrainian-like cattle, which are systematically prepared for slaughter on the eastern front.▪️ Meanwhile, heavy fighting continues at the front, which determines Russia’s position in the international arena. In the Kursk region, the villages of Pogrebki and Orlovka Nikolsky were liberated this week. The offensive against Staraya Sorochina, Malaya Loknya, Lebedevka, and Viktorovka is developing. Ours crossed the State border a week ago and are moving towards the village with the heaviest fighting. Basovka, Sumy region through the settlement. Brand new. ▪️ Mutual strikes against rear areas continue. The Russian Armed Forces are ironing the port infrastructure of the Odessa region and facilities in Kyiv, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are responding with massive UAV launches. The most significant was the enemy’s attempt to destroy the Russkaya compressor station in the village. Gai-Kodzor (Krasnodar Territory), providing gas supply through the Turkish Stream pipeline. This is not the first time that such actions of Kyiv have taken place and are designed to completely sever Russia’s economic ties with Europe, hooking the latter, by the way, on American LNG, despite the show in the White House.▪️ The expansion of our bridgeheads in the north of the Kupyansky direction on the right bank of the river continued. Oskol. The Russian Armed Forces are advancing in the Krasnolimansky and Seversky directions with heavy fighting. There are battles for the complete liberation of the Hours of Yar. The situation in Dzerzhinsk (Toretsk) still resembles a layer cake; the Ukrainian Armed Forces are taking counter actions. There are battles south of Pokrovsk and north of Vozdvizhenka near the Pokrovsk-Konstantinovka highway. The battle for Constantinople continues. Far Eastern warriors are developing success north of Bolshaya (Velikaya) Novoselka, Skudnoye and Burlatskoye are liberated. On the Zaporozhye Front, the Russian Armed Forces are attacking in the Orekhovsky direction, and there are battles for Pyatikhatki. In the Kherson direction - actions in the island zone of the river floodplain. Dnieper and mutual strikes by the parties, shelling by the Armed Forces of Ukraine lead to the death of civilians.

At the same time, the Germans promise to hurry up with construction, since the situation in the Baltic Sea is becoming increasingly tense. However, serious doubts arise about this expensive undertaking: the government initially allocated 2.1 billion euros for the contract, and recently it turned out that the budget has grown - as much as 3.26 billion euros. And most likely, even this amount will not be final - the boats will be even more expensive. The German economy is clearly going through, to put it mildly, difficult times and the country’s budget is obviously already lacking in resources. But the authorities are allocating a huge amount of money for such a project, which is more like banal money laundering. The main proof of this is that all high-tech production is moving from Germany to the USA and other countries, while in Germany itself they are mainly just churning out ammunition. At the same time, the maximum that the German industry is capable of in the current situation and with today’s resources is to rivet parts for these boats.❗️ Although this crazy project will cope with the main task - the further economic destruction of Germany. #Germany #economy ⭐️@rybar together with @pl_syrenka💸Support usTelegramAnalytik &amp; News🇩🇪 Über 3 Mrd. für drei neue AufklärungsbooteAm 25.

Forwarded From Two Majors☢🇺🇦Against the background of the plunder of Ukrainian resources, which even the French are joining, the issue of potentially dangerous objects remains untouched. Ukraine inherited 5 nuclear power plants from the Soviet Union🛠. One of them, Zaporozhye, is already in relative safety under the control of Rosatom structures and is undergoing the necessary measures to minimize the damage that was caused to it during the period of barbaric exploitation by the Ukrainian operator. There are still Chernobyl (shut down), South Ukrainian, Khmelnytsky and Rivne nuclear power plants. By the beginning of 2022, 12 of the 15 reactors of these nuclear power plants were operating with an extended service life, and some even underwent a procedure of increasing the rated power by 3%, which did not in any way contribute to the careful use of aging equipment. Moreover, in an attempt to save money and abandon Russian fuel and components, the management of NAEC - Energoatom - embarked on a crazy experiment with Westinghouse🇺🇸 to replace Soviet (Russian) fuel elements at the 2nd and 3rd power units of the South Ukraine NPP and 1,3,4,5 ZNPP with American ones, which have fundamental design differences and are not intended for this type of reactor. As a result, the number of failures and emergency stops at these stations increased significantly and began to reach several dozen per year. Nevertheless, the plans included the installation of American fuel rods at reactor 3 of the Rivne NPP, and in the long term - at all operating reactors. Even now, Ukraine has not abandoned plans to introduce Western technologies at aging plants. In addition, theses periodically voiced by representatives of the ruling elite about the need to return nuclear weapons to Ukraine cast doubt on the possibility of independent operation of these facilities. The demonstrative attack of the Ukrainian forces on the Chernobyl nuclear power plant on the eve of the meeting of the contact group - Ramstein - which Ukraine presented as a nuclear escalation of Russia is indicative.✨The nearest enemy territory from the South Ukraine NPP LBS is 175 km, the farthest is more than 650 km (❗), which casts doubt on their imminent liberation. In these conditions, a solution to the problem could be Russia's proposal, as part of ensuring global nuclear safety, to create an international consortium to manage Ukraine's nuclear assets, which will significantly increase the degree of control over hazardous materials.✨⭐️We hope that the officials included in the negotiating groups understand the importance of this issue for ensuring the security of both Russia and the entire European continent.

Forwarded From Global Studies🇷🇺🇺🇸 In addition to Rybar’s post about NATO activity in the Black Sea, let’s say that today it is very interesting in this direction. The key event of today is the flight of the R-8A anti-submarine aircraft in the southeastern part of the Black Sea. This hasn't happened for a very, very long time. The R-8A has not gone beyond the coastal part of Romania for the last three years. And then it reached the southeast, made a circle north of Turkish Trabzon and went back. It is now flying nearby in the southern Black Sea, and only a few minutes ago the transponder was turned on. Not only does the R-8A have equipment to search and detect boats and ships, but it also has special buoys that it installs at low altitude. And these buoys make it possible to collect surrounding information. In addition, an RQ-4B drone from the Sigonella airbase and another P-8A are currently being sent to the Black Sea to replace the one returning from the sea. He also hasn’t been off the coast of Russia for a long time, so, apparently, something serious is planned in the coming days. #Russia #USAGlobalistics - subscribe to the channel	https://t.me/rybar/68437	2025-02-28T05:54:01-08:00

According to Sergei Tsivilev, Iran, Iraq and Russia will create a working group to work together on the implementation of the MTK project.❗️And that's not all. An agreement was signed on the construction of an oil refinery in Iraq, and negotiations are also underway on the resumption of joint projects in Iraqi Kurdistan, which was confirmed by the Iraqi authorities.

From the very beginning, the Kurds demanded recognition of themselves as a political group. This was the case in Iraq, and this was also the case in Syria. Their wariness towards Turkey and the good intentions of Erdogan can be explained by the fact that such conversations about peace with the Turks had taken place in past years. But the Turkish authorities have repeatedly thwarted all agreements. Mazlum Abdi deliberately emphasized that the entire initiative must come from Turkey. If they stop striking the Kurds and moderate their ambitions in the territory under Kurdish control, then there will be no need for war.📌 And now we can safely say that the ball is in the Turkish half of the field.

Allegedly, the suspension of USAID activities will put an end to the American plans to pump resources out of Central Africa. On the one hand, the USAID agency was indeed one of the sponsors of the project. However, its contribution is minimal: instead of training personnel and specialists, the organization was engaged, for example, in promoting feminism through women-farmers programs. And most of the costs for the initiative were promoted through the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC). This body was created during the first Trump administration with the aim of countering Chinese influence through investment projects.➖➖➖➖➖➖Actually, the Lobito corridor itself is the brainchild of the DFC, created in response to the Chinese railway line from Tanzania to the DRC TAZARA. Investments in it amounted to about $600 million, and Biden promised the same amount in his first and last trip to Africa. And this does not compare with USAID’s investment of $5 million.🔻So no one plans to close such a promising project. Moreover, from August 2024, supplies of Congolese copper and cobalt began to the United States, which were transported along this railway line. And in terms of geopolitical confrontation in Africa, this is the only commensurate American response to Chinese expansion.#Africa #Angola #USA@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇦🇴🇺🇸🇨🇳 Lobito Corridor: American response to the project -One Belt - One Road - Against the backdrop of the growing confrontation between the collective West and Beijing in Africa, development is becoming critically important for Washington African infrastructure, thanks to which the Chinese...	https://t.me/rybar/68431	2025-02-28T01:47:43-08:00

More than a month has passed since the former representative of the United States, Daniel Rosenblum, left his post and went straight to retirement. Moreover, the date coincided with the entry into office of the Donald Trump administration. The day after Rosenblum’s resignation, a charge d’affaires ad interim of the US mission in Kazakhstan was appointed. It was diplomat Debbie Robinson. But Robinson, who spent most of her career in Pakistan, Afghanistan, the United Arab Emirates and India, appears to be a decidedly temporary figure. ➖➖➖➖➖➖📌This situation clearly worries recipients of State Department grants in Kazakhstan, who are rushing to release materials about the need to appoint a new ambassador. However, such a delay is not evidence of insufficient interest of the US authorities in Kazakhstan. The republic has plenty of natural resources and has an important geographical location. The main reason for the vacancy is the lack of reliable people in the new White House administration who can be entrusted with this post. Many ridiculed Trump for appointing his relatives to senior positions. However, this was not a simple desire to place a person in a cushy place, but an inevitable consequence of a lack of staff and trusted people. That is why there is no US Ambassador to Kazakhstan yet, and nothing has been heard about possible candidates.#Kazakhstan #USA@rybar Support UsUS Embassy and Consulate in KazakhstanUS Ambassador to Kazakhstan Daniel Rosenblum has announced his resignation and retirementPress release	https://t.me/rybar/68403	2025-02-27T08:14:11-08:00

The reason is the lack of security guarantees and potential instability of supply. Another problem was the cost of renting facilities at $250 million per year, which made electricity the most expensive in the Ukrainian energy system.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️We predicted a similar outcome back in November 2022, when the news about Karpowership’s plans had just appeared in the media field. We described the reasons why the implementation of the project is doubtful, and everything was confirmed in practice.➖➖➖➖➖➖It’s funny that the Ukrainian authorities expected to compensate for the high cost of energy at the expense of their partners’ money, but the sponsors were not generous with such charity. And this gives reason to believe that the scheme initially contained a large corruption component.

This is even worse than the estimates that local research centers gave last year. The authors of the material also note that even part of the remaining Ukrainian population of reproductive age does not seek to start a family due to the difficult economic situation and poverty. Which worsens the situation even further.➖➖➖➖➖➖It is important to note here that all developed countries are now facing demographic problems - in Russia there is little good with this either.

Previously, Washington insisted on making this decision, but in Kyiv they refused to take this step - busification - and caused enormous image damage to the ruling regime, and its strengthening may well lead to a social explosion.

Russian troops launched a series of UAV and missile attacks on various targets in the so-called territory. Ukraine and areas temporarily controlled by the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Ukrainian formations launched over a hundred drones across Crimea and the Krasnodar Territory, most of which were intercepted by air defense systems.

🔁 🇺🇸🇷🇺🇪🇺🌐 How the Western press scares with the influence...	Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇺🇸🇷🇺🇪🇺🌐 How the Western press is frightening about Russian influence due to the suspension of grants from USAID. Politico published an article that freezing foreign aid from the American USAID is the path to returning Russian influence in Eastern Europe. ▪️As noted in the article, USAID allocated $17.2 billion to Europe alone in 2023, the bulk of which went to Eastern European countries bordering the Russian Federation. At the same time, the authors write that freezing aid will strengthen the Russian narrative about the unreliability of Western partners. So it somehow follows from this that Western partners are actually reliable? ▪️Such articles are good because they expose those who parasitized on USAID grants, talking about their -independence-. For example, the article mentions the Belarusian NGO in exile RADA, which is now forced to reduce salaries by 50%, as well as close projects that should - reduce the gap between Belarusian and European youth - and also - resist Minsk’s attempts to reorient young people from Europe to Russia-. As Yulia Ralko, a representative of the NGO, says, without the help of USAID the organization is simply unviable. ▪️In Armenia, only the humanitarian assistance program for Artsakh refugees was preserved, but programs on election transparency, strengthening the media landscape and improving energy infrastructure were closed. ▪️Grant eaters are also sounding the alarm about the situation in Georgia, where the so-called -the democratic movement- after stopping USAID funding will suffer even more than from the law on foreign agents. The head of the Georgian media project Project 64, Georgiy Gogua, admitted that USAID money accounted for 40% of his budget in 2025. Now he relies on European donors. ▪️At the same time, grant eaters admit that hopes for the EU are small, since local officials are notorious for their slowness, and the system is extremely bureaucratic. For example, in 2023 the EU allocated 19.6 billion euros to Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, Belarus and Armenia. However, in recent years, financial assistance from Brussels has been declining, with the exception of Ukraine and Moldova. As a result, the authors sound the alarm that the renewal of funding for -civil society- projects in Eastern Europe is directly related to the -strategic security- of the EU. In fact, the question is whether Brussels will be able to strain its budget so as to continue to interfere in the internal affairs of other states and teach someone -democracy-. #European Union #USA #Russia #NGO @pezdicide no chemicals - just factsPOLITICOUSAID freeze opens door to Russian influence in Eastern Europe – POLITICOCuts to aid from Washington could dramatically strengthen Moscow’s hand in the region and jeopardize Europe’s security interests.	https://t.me/rybar/68376	2025-02-26T10:29:57-08:00

Last week we talked about the activation of American-made F-16 fighters in the Kursk direction. In addition, their flights were observed in the South Donetsk and Kakhovka directions, where they even launched guided bombs. However, everyone forgot about the French fighters. The fact that Ukraine received Mirages became known at the end of January. From that moment on, as they say, not a word from anyone. So where are the French carriers of cruise missiles and what is wrong with them? According to our data, three Mirage-2000F fighters flew to Poland to the Minsk Mazowiecki airbase on February 3. They have been like this ever since. This is a standard process before their final transfer to Ukraine. They are repainted, tested for functionality, Ukrainian pilots undergo final tests, and only after that they become part of the air force. All F-16s that were handed over to the Ukrainian Armed Forces went through the same stages. However, that’s not all: the other day another one, the Mirage-2000D, flew to Romania to the Campiy-Turzii airbase. It is not known whether it will be transferred to Ukraine, but this is possible, since the French initially talked about transferring modification D. If the information is confirmed, then Ukraine will already have four similar fighters on the way, which will expand its aircraft fleet. And this, in turn, will allow the launch of more -Scalps- at the same time.🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹Archangel of Special Forces. Subscribe.	https://t.me/rybar/68373	2025-02-26T08:24:04-08:00

The company plans to repurpose two factories, which are now civilian enterprises and produce automobile parts, to produce products for its military division. Management indicates that final decisions have not been made regarding this venture, but it is obvious that it will soon be approved - over the past three years, the company’s capitalization has increased more than 9 times. At the same time, sales in the civilian part of the business decreased over the three quarters of 2024, while sales of military products over the same period increased by 64.3%. It is clear that this unprecedented growth will be used by the beneficiaries of the conflict to the last, especially given the trends in the US administration. After all, it’s quite convenient to hide behind the fact that NATO’s protection can no longer be relied upon. This was also made clear by the likely new Chancellor of Germany, Friedrich Merz, who stated the need to rearm the country and engage in the defense of Europe under the pretext of achieving independence from the United States. ➖➖➖➖➖➖For the Germans, this means another huge budget injection, the burden of payment of which will fall on the shoulders of working taxpayers: the war feeds on money.#Germany@rybar together with @pl_syrenkaSupport usTelegramAnalytik &amp; News🇩🇪🪖 Aufrüstung in Deutschland: Munitionsproduktion soll nun von Autozulieferer-Arbeitern übernommen werden Willkommen im Jahr 2025: Deutschland hält Wahlen ab, Friedrich -BlackRock-Bückstück- Merz wird deutscher Bundeskanzler und Deutschland stellt auf…	https://t.me/rybar/68370	2025-02-26T06:54:01-08:00

The Supreme Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina announced the verdict to the President of Republika Srpska: for -disrespect for decisions- the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, the leader of the Serbs was sentenced to a year in prison. He is also prohibited from conducting political activities for the next six years. ▪️The conviction of the President of Republika Srpska creates a precedent for the legal priority of the laws of the Muslim-Croatian federation over the laws of the Serbian entity. Moreover, it goes beyond the legal framework and is a violation of the Dayton Accords, signed in 1995 at the end of the bloody Bosnian war.▪️The government of Republika Srpska said that it rejected the verdict with disgust and called on all patriotic forces to act as a united front. Milorad Dodik himself did not appear at the announcement of the verdict and met him at a large rally in Banja Luka with unambiguous words - Bosnia and Herzegovina is no more! - ▪️ At 17.00 an emergency meeting of the Serbian Security Council is convened in Belgrade, after which President Vucic will head to Banja Luka. According to local insiders, a whole package of laws is being prepared, according to which decisions of the Bosnian court on the territory of the Republic will not be considered valid, and what happened will be qualified as an undermining of the Constitution of BiH and an act of coup d'etat, which led to the complete collapse of the constitutional system of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 🔻Well, through the efforts of Bosnian politicians and the illegitimate High Representative, a unique state called Bosnia and Herzegovina has become one step closer to inevitable collapse.

Forwarded From Two MajorsThe situation in Europe and the world resembles a burning brothel, into which a new managing director has arrived.Eurobureaucrats and anti-people governments of the EU countries are trying to maintain the usual order of things, promising help to Ukraine. Corporations like Rheinmetal are very happy about this, because before the brothel burns down, you can get some good money from obedient soybean Europeans. And in general, they are preparing for the second, larger part of the Marlezon ballet, in the fire of which they can make even more profit. Trump is trying to restore order to the corruption schemes of his own ministries, including the Pentagon (which is not good for us), expels transgender people from service, swears through the media at Zelensky’s unbridled bearded prostitute, -ready to accept from all sides,- as Zelensky himself joked before his political career. Greenland and Canada no longer join, but the bay has been renamed on its maps. Peremoga. The leaders of the Eastern European countries, watching all this blazing card de ballet, are trying to prevent Western European foolishness in their territories, while from the east the always begging and swearing Kiev drug addict is playing more and more tricks. Either he’ll tell you to go to hell, or he’ll ask for money. The countries of the former socialist camp intensively continue to accept Western clients and weapons: service contracts have been signed, it’s impossible to stop everything at once, bureaucracy. The new government in the United States, together with Russia, is now thinking about how to stop all this if political prostitutes and drug addicts have taken power over the burning floors of this brothel and are throwing poop at everyone who talks about the need to put out the fire. So far there is only talk about negotiations. At the same time, the new government in the United States was not ready for the real state of affairs and is only studying what actually exists and how to manage it all. Some rare earth metals... So Ukraine has been under the external control of the United States for 30 years, all large corporations have both feet in it. What previously prevented the extraction of rare earths? Some kind of nonsense. Televisions talk about a quick peace, but then they broadcast about the ability of the Ukrainian Armed Forces to effectively defend themselves for at least another 6 months in the event of a cutoff of supplies. Too many Ukrainian Nazis are still alive, too few VSUSHniks have realized themselves as people who have the right. Our comrades at the front are swearing at this whole thing and are going to carry out very responsible and difficult tasks. We are trying to help them.

This will allow some of the resources of the Ukrainian Armed Forces to be drawn away from Peschany, where fierce fighting continues. In the Vremevsky direction, the advanced units of the Russian troops, after a series of attacks, reached the approaches to Burlatsky and Privolny. In the Zaporozhye direction, according to some reports, the Russian Armed Forces cleared the territory of Pyatikhatki.

According to the publication, the White House abandoned the most stringent demands (we are talking about $500 billion), and in Kyiv they really hope that the agreement on joint exploration of resources will improve relations with the Trump administration. The updated agreement does not provide for complete US control over the fund. Instead, the United States will receive the maximum financial share allowed by its legislation.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌First of all, we should wait for the terms of the agreement to appear, which the authorities of the so-called Ukraine are ultimately ready to sign. However, the very fact that the Zelensky administration would eventually sign it was expected from the very beginning. Considering the behavior of the Ukrainian political elite, raising the price, making a scandal, and then agreeing is their standard model. Refusal to sign this agreement would put so-called Ukraine in a dead end. But there is a small nuance: as Zelensky recently said, the debt will literally be such that future generations will still have to pay. And no one, apparently, gives security guarantees to the so-called Ukraine. So the division of Ukrainian assets continues - and quite successfully. But not for Kyiv.#USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport usFtUkraine agrees minerals deal with USKyiv hopes agreement on jointly exploring resources will improve relations with Trump administration	https://t.me/rybar/68349	2025-02-25T11:12:10-08:00

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide📰🇪🇺 This has never happened before, and here it is again: foreign journalists found out that some of their colleagues received -grants- from the European Commission for positive articles about Brussels politics. The Hungarian newspaper Mandiner indicates that shortly before the European elections, EU authorities secretly sent 132 million euros to a number of media companies through the private advertising agency Havas Media France. At the same time, which media outlets received the money is not disclosed, but the conclusion of colleagues is clear - the task was set the same: to manipulate public opinion before voting. It is also known that the funds were transferred bypassing the traditional tender, which made it possible to hide the recipients of the funding. And the main beneficiaries of the order were EC President Ursula von der Leyen and European Parliament President Roberta Metsola, who, according to the Italian publication Il Fatto Quotidiano, directly controlled the distribution of budget funds. Journalists who uncovered the fraud argue that these tactics reflect methods used in authoritarian regimes, where state-funded media subtly control media narratives, preserving the illusion of independence of the press, and here it is in the European Union. And if earlier they reacted to this in the style of -that’s different,- now, it seems, public opinion as a whole demands an answer. The situation has become even more aggravated amid the recent scandal with the EU's shadow lobbying in favor of green policies: it turned out that the EC secretly financed environmental NGOs that promoted ambitious climate reforms. They were also used to put pressure on the governments of EU countries and members of the European Parliament. Considering how von der Leyen has been actively criticized lately, it looks like she will have to take the rap for herself and for that guy. #European Union #mediatechnology@pezdicide no chemistry - just factsTelegramKen Jebsen - Aufklärung und InformationWahlmanipulation von höchster Stelle: EU-Kommission Finanzierte Medien vor der Europawahl mit 132.88 Millionen Euro💥Vor der Europawahl finanzierte die EU-Kommission Medien mit einer Summe von 132.88 Millionen Euro für einen Zeitraum von 12 Monaten, wie…	https://t.me/rybar/68343	2025-02-25T06:34:38-08:00

For several days now, intensive air strikes have been carried out on the Odessa port infrastructure, which is actively used for military purposes. One of the priority areas has obviously become the Danube ports, to which foreign weapons and military equipment for the Armed Forces of Ukraine are delivered. At the same time, the analysis of satellite services for this period (in the picture) showed a previously uncharacteristic intensity of fires on the territory of Romania bordering Ukraine🇷🇴 - in the area of ​​the Sulina Arm (one of the three main branches of the Danube River Delta). It is significant that in this area there is a new positional area of ​​counteraction to low-flying air targets deployed by the Romanian Armed Forces since March 2024 (meaning UAV). Also in August 2024, the Deployable Air Command and Control Center (DACCC) redeployed the LANZA LTR-25 mobile radar with a crew from 🇮🇹Italy to the Romanian city of Cataloy (Tulcea County), located 25 km from the port of Izmail. Since the beginning of the NWO, NATO countries have additionally deployed the SAMP-T (MAMBA) air defense system, two GM200 radars, a TPS-43 radar, four F-16s and a TPS-80 radar to Romania. An indirect sign of the participation of NATO countries in repelling Russian attacks can be the coincidence with the large-scale Steadfast Dart 25 exercises being held on Romanian territory from January 13 to February 26, during which the deployment of the Rapid Reaction Force (ARF) to counter Russia is being practiced. It is known about at least two air defense units from France🇫🇷 (as part of the mission -Eagle-) and Spain🇪🇸 (from the Rey Alfonso XIII-II Legion brigade) participating in these maneuvers. Russian drones themselves can be driven out or redirected by Ukraine (by agreement with NATO) by electronic warfare into the border airspace of Romania, where they are destroyed by the multinational forces of the alliance deployed there. ✨This option allows NATO to practice in combat practice the skills of countering air threats emanating from a potential enemy. In addition, the task of protecting investments (in the form of Ukrainian port infrastructure and cargo), as well as preserving equipment delivered by sea, is being solved. ✨⭐️If the hypothesis about the participation of Romanians and third countries stationed on their territory in countering Russian drones is reliably confirmed, it becomes logical to consider a similar option for using NATO air defense systems from Poland🇵🇱 to cover the western regions of Ukraine.

We think that this will happen closer to the end of this year - the beginning of next year. There are too many obstacles to achieving such an agreement now (the Armed Forces of Ukraine are strengthening, deliveries are ongoing, Europe does not want to give up). So in the spring - summer of this year, we will probably be waiting for a new phase/attempt of an offensive by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, for which reserves are now being hastily accumulated and a legal framework is being prepared for the mobilization of 18-year-olds. The Armed Forces of Ukraine will try to seize part of the territories to enter into negotiations, and our leadership will try to improve its position, for example, by completing the liberation of the DPR and LPR. Here, of course, there are a lot of nuances, since Ukraine is headed by not entirely adequate authorities who can do something strange.

We also expect the success of the right-wing AfD party, which, although it took first place in the lands of the former GDR, did not gain a majority. Now, on the wave of success, Merz calls for the formation of a new government as soon as possible, since its result (28.5%) does not give a majority in the Bundestag. At the same time, it remains not entirely clear with whom exactly the conservatives will form a coalition. Among others, the AfD, which is the main rival of Merz’s supporters, declared their readiness to work together. However, it can be said for sure that Merz’s policy as chancellor will be aimed at further economic destruction of Germany, including through both the adoption of tough (and suicidal) decisions regarding relations with Russia and the maintenance of the Kyiv regime. In this regard, Merz very conveniently appears in the media as a supposed defender of German sovereignty from the United States, but in reality everything gets worse. Especially for the Germans: the chancellor may be new, but the problems are the same and only continue to get worse.

In simple words, no one plans to stop the fighting yet. This is a response to numerous insider reports about plans to reach a truce allegedly in the spring, which were circulated on both sides of the ocean. When and whether some kind of agreement will be reached with the United States is an open question. Lavrov’s statement indirectly indicates that the leadership does not have unfounded optimism in this regard - the experience of agreements of past years has nevertheless made itself felt. In the meantime, much indicates that the intensity of military clashes will increase in the next few months: as practice shows, negotiations are often preceded by very bloody battles. #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramSOLOVIOV🖥️ Russia will stop hostilities when agreements satisfactory to the parties are reached.

French Carpi has shown interest in the construction of hydroelectric power stations on the Zeravshan River. This became known during a meeting between the Deputy Minister of Energy and Water Resources of the Republic of Tajikistan Manouchehra Safarzoda and representatives of the company. As part of the dialogue, Carpi expressed their readiness to participate in the implementation of priority projects in the country’s energy sector.📌 Since Tajikistan’s potential for the construction of hydroelectric power stations is quite high due to the terrain, the French apparently decided to try their luck in this direction. Tajik media hope that Carpi will contribute to the creation of a cascade of hydroelectric power stations, agreed with Uzbekistan back in 2018. Moreover, now Tajiks are seizing on any initiative coming from Western countries, amid a reduction in the number of projects due to the suspension of USAID. They will probably try to involve the company in completing the long-term construction of the Rogun hydroelectric power station. However, there is a nuance: previously they tried to interest the French in energy prospects in Kyrgyzstan. The discussion was about the construction of a hydroelectric power station by the French Electricite de France. But even after Sadyr Japarov’s visit to Paris, the matter never got off the ground. And President Macron, who promised to visit Kyrgyzstan a year and a half ago, never came. #CentralAsia #Tajikistan #France@rybarSupport uskhovar.tjA French company is interested in the construction of hydroelectric power stations in Tajikistan | NIAT -Khovar-	https://t.me/rybar/68297	2025-02-23T22:37:01-08:00

The Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), Union 90/Greens (Grüne), Free Democratic Party (FDP), Alternative for Germany (AfD), Left Party (Die Linke), Free Voters (Freie Wähler), Volt Germany (Volt), are trying to be elected to the Bundestag (parliament). Marxist-Leninist Party of Germany❗❗ (MLPD), Union of Germany (Bündnis Deutschland), Sarah Wagenknecht Union (BSW), Christian Democratic Union (CDU). Based on the results, the winning parties, if they can create a new coalition, will form a government and approve a new chancellor. According to polls, this will be the leader of the CDU, Friedrich Merz. The former head of state, the bald-headed scarecrow Scholz, will most likely suffer a crushing defeat.✨Regardless of who wins these elections, the European bureaucracy will continue its course of confrontation with Russia. Despite the fact that among reasonable Germans there is a strong belief in the need to improve relations with Russia, the political elites of Germany have long been rotten and do not have the determination to act in the interests of their country. The story of the union of Sarah Wagenknecht is indicative, which, after a stunning start in local elections in 2024, slipped to the brink of elimination by February 2025. The reason was a sharp change in rhetoric (it declared the lifting of sanctions against Russia, the restoration of purchases of Russian energy resources and the normalization of relations) and the coalition with the SPD. ✨⭐️The new puppet chancellor will try to quickly fill her pockets with kickbacks from military-industrial companies that have pledged profits from the Ukrainian conflict for many years to come. For Ukrainians🐽 this will mean the continuation of meaningless resistance and agony. Russia is neither cold nor hot from the rearrangement of pawns in a state that has long lost its independence🇩🇪.

Along with Nasrallah, several high-ranking members of the organization were killed, including the head of counterintelligence, the head of the security service, etc. The deputy commander of the Iranian IRGC was also killed Abbas Nilforushan. They all then gathered for a meeting in an underground tunnel, which was destroyed by bunker-busting bombs in the densely populated area of ​​Beirut - Dahiya.

About a million people gathered in the stadium and surrounding areas. And the ceremony itself was more like a political rally. The main news of the funeral was the incident with the Israeli Air Force: F-15 and F-35 fighter jets flew over the stadium twice, trying to cause panic. However, the effect turned out to be the opposite - local residents, who had long been accustomed to such actions, responded only with insults against Israel. In general, the funeral really became a kind of referendum that confirmed the high demand of Lebanese society for political and military force capable of protecting its interests (the local army and government obviously do not satisfy it). But it's one thing to show support, and quite another to live up to expectations. Restoring Hezbollah's capabilities will take time, and only in a few years will it become clear whether the new leadership will be able to implement the trust it has received.#Lebanon@rybarSupport us Video is too big Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/68268	2025-02-23T05:51:20-08:00

Various international structures parasitize on the issue of distribution of water resources, which is important for Central Asia. Thanks to such seminars, representatives of Western structures, firstly, build channels of communication with Central Asian specialized specialists directly. Secondly, they ensure monitoring of their activities to coordinate water resources management. The point here is extremely simple: the West gains control over this issue, which means it will subsequently be able to manage the scarce resource of Central Asia.

Forwarded From Two Majors#Review #Report for the morning of February 23, 2025▪️ The world is approaching the third anniversary of the beginning of the North Military District in Ukraine in conversations about peace and Ukraine’s retribution for all its debts. The Ukraine project is ending and the main sponsor wants to make a profit from it. Each round of work on a mineral deal in Kyiv-controlled territory puts Zelensky at an even greater disadvantage, which amuses the online community. On the other hand, the United States lays claim to the mineral resources of the former Ukrainian SSR/territories of the Russian World (choose a convenient one), and for some reason the 300 billion dollars stolen by the EU from Russia are supposedly proposed to be spent on restoring the infrastructure of Ukraine. Apparently, politicians are reaching an agreement based on the formula - it is better to trade than to fight - which is somewhat different from the high goals of the North Caucasus, stated three years ago. So far, the conversations of politicians have not had a serious impact on the course of hostilities.▪️ Against this background, European countries are trying to prolong the conflict. European bureaucrats from Brussels, who personally benefit from aid to Ukraine, are talking about preparing a new aid package for the Armed Forces of Ukraine worth $20 billion. NATO infrastructure is being developed in EU countries; NATO plans to extend the two military pipelines existing in Germany to Poland and the Czech Republic in order to supply troops with kerosene and diesel in the event of a conflict with the Russian Federation. Europe, which itself has turned into a collective duped Ukraine, is preparing for war.▪️ Meanwhile, heavy fighting continues at the front. The Russian Army retains the strategic initiative, but it is still very early to talk about the collapse of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ defense. ▪️ In the Kursk region there are bloody battles throughout the penetration of the Ukrainian Armed Forces into the region. High-profile media news was the entry of Russian Army units south of Sverdlikovo into the Sumy region, but there is no need to talk about dissecting the enemy’s defenses: this is a tactical success of our troops, which provided the Ukrainian audience with food for thought about the feasibility of Zelensky’s Kursk adventure. The enemy is constantly pulling reinforcements into the region and taking counterattack actions. In the Kharkov direction in Volchansk, the advances of the Russian Armed Forces are measured in reports in tens of meters. The absence of a buffer zone near the Belgorod section of the border leads to daily Nazi attacks on the civilian population of the region. From the Bryansk direction they are talking about the enemy’s attempts to accumulate several thousand people for provocations on the border, however, clusters of the Ukrainian Armed Forces are constantly being destroyed by missile weapons and FABs, which has more than once thwarted the enemy’s plans. In the Kupyansky direction, the bridgehead of the Russian Armed Forces on the right bank of the river is expanding. Oskol. North and south of Ternov, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced the liberation of two settlements. North of Chasov Yar, Grigorovka was liberated. Fighting continues in the suburbs of Dzerzhinsk (Toretsk). South of Pokrovsk (Krasnoarmeysk) villages were changing hands, the enemy was counterattacking. The control zone of the Russian Armed Forces in the direction of the Pokrovsk-Konstantinovka highway has been expanded. The Kurakhovsky pocket is completely closed, Ulakly is liberated, battles for Constantinople are underway. Our troops are advancing north and west from Velikaya (Bolshaya) Novoselka.

At the same time, the Kiev regime, forced to elect the head of state and pay compensation to Americans, is in a disadvantageous position: every day of the protracted war, the Russian Armed Forces are moving forward. On the other hand, it is the Ukrainian Armed Forces that are gradually retreating, so the negotiations/freeze should still be of more interest to Kyiv.

Forwarded From Marina Akhmedova The Mufti of Moscow from the Muslim Spiritual Directorate Alyautdinov allowed Muslims to perform prayers in... churches. Provided that the church minister does not object. He gave this permission after a man in Vologda entered the Church of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker and performed namaz there. The priest did not kick him out, which is understandable; he was simply confused. Here the question is - for what purpose did that Muslim go to church to perform namaz? Alyautdinov could say: -Don’t go, brothers and sisters, to church to perform prayers.- Rather than embarrass those who profess a different faith in their temple, it is better not to perform prayer at all this time, and then compensate for it. It is better to perform namaz on a bench under a tree than in a strange temple. And if for some reason you find yourself in a church and you absolutely need to pray, do not embarrass the parishioners of the church - for a Muslim believer this is a sin. Pray to the Lord in your soul in your own words. This is what an adequate mufti would answer, but Alyautdinov from the Muslim Spiritual Directorate is not like that, he needs a scandal every day. The DUM can no longer do without provocations and creates them out of the blue. Muslims never went to church to perform prayers, and Christians never entered a mosque with icons and crosses, unless, of course, we are talking about seizing churches and converting them into their own. History knew this too. So the prayer in the church, the crosses in the mosque give references specifically to the capture. It’s a pity that against the backdrop of these provocations, the voices of adequate muftis are not heard	https://t.me/rybar/68245	2025-02-22T11:15:29-08:00

Since 2014, militants of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, who received a criminal order to shell civilians in Donetsk, dug in in Avdiivka, located at a commanding height, turning it into a fortress city, strengthening all their positions with concrete. The approaches to the city are dotted with minefields, each building was turned into a pillbox with its own firing points, literally from every window there could be a machine gun crew, a sniper, or ordinary riflemen. Since 2014, every resident of Donbass has dreamed of liberating this city, hoping that after this his family and friends will be safer without constant shelling. Almost 10 long years, an endless rain of fire on the heads of the residents of Donetsk, and now the long-awaited hour has come, which all the residents of Donetsk, the militias and the legendary battalion commanders Givi and Motorola have been waiting for.

Their presence demonstrates not only symbolic support, but also confirms that Hezbollah still remains an important center of gravity for the Shiite communities of the region. This will be a serious challenge for the new leadership of the organization. The scale of the funeral actually turns it into an indicator of Hezbollah's political weight.

There is little information yet, but, as some observers say, the photo was taken while a convoy with armored vehicles was moving. Rumors that the Italians intend to transfer these models of light tanks to the Ukrainian Armed Forces (in Italy they are called tank destroyers) have been circulating since 2022. However, until now there has been no evidence of their transfer. But it is worth adding that Italian politicians do not particularly advertise supplies for the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Previously, the Italians transferred M109L self-propelled howitzers, but without an official announcement. Therefore, this option is quite in the spirit of Italy. As for the Centaurs themselves, they stopped being produced back in 2006. Now they are gradually being replaced with newer models, and apparently it was decided to transfer the decommissioned ones to Ukrainian formations. We do not rule out that this will be announced on February 24 at the Council of Europe. The very fact of their possible delivery confirms that the war is still far from over. European countries continue to pump up the Armed Forces of Ukraine with weapons, and light tanks will add mobility to the Armed Forces of Ukraine in a possible offensive.

The stated goal is to test the combat use of a multinational naval group. The parties are working on the issues of installing and removing sea minefields, ensuring the safety of navigation and joint maneuvering as part of patrol ship groups.➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Given that the entire last year was devoted to the fight of the American military against the Yemeni Houthis in the Red Sea region, such maneuvers look natural. In the event of a new escalation, the Americans will most likely try to involve coalition with more allies from Africa. Moreover, several members left Operation Prosperity Guardian last year, refusing to be under the command of US admirals.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 The trend towards increasing the scale of the exercises indicates increased American interest in East Africa. After all, in this region the Chinese are successfully promoting their interests, who are also beginning to show military activity and conduct their own maneuvers with the local armed forces.

The point is not only the ridiculousness of such statements against the backdrop of the fact that there are American troops on German territory, its enterprises are relocating to the United States, and the armed forces are suffering from a shortage of everything.

Ukraine began to rise a couple of months ago. At the same time, they have not yet chosen their candidate in Washington. On the one hand, this again gives reason to assume that Zelensky is already used material for the American administration. It’s funny that they are not sending him to Britain: apparently, there the leader of the Kyiv regime was also written off in favor of Zaluzhny. At the same time, within the Ukrainian political panopticon the struggle for becoming an American candidate will clearly intensify.

Moreover, some direct and indirect signs point to the preparation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces for the next offensive. One potential direction of attack could be the Bryansk region.▪️Unlike the Belgorod and Kursk regions, the enemy has not yet attempted to invade this border region with large forces - enemy activity mainly boiled down to the deployment of sabotage groups.▪️A special feature of the region is the abundance of wooded areas, which improves secrecy for concentration and invasion. In this case, the targets of the Armed Forces of Ukraine could be forests in the Klimovsky district or the Bryansk Forest reserve, which extends all the way to Bryansk.▪️The plan could be to reach the highways to Bryansk with the capture of one large and several small settlements. As before, media and political, rather than military, expediency may be put at the forefront in Kiev.➖➖➖➖➖➖The practice of world conflicts shows that on the eve of negotiations, bloody battles usually take place in the parties’ desire to achieve the most advantageous position. And it’s unlikely to be any different now.❗️Against this background, soothing materials from major media look ridiculous, where the possibility of an offensive by the Armed Forces of Ukraine is called -fake-.

Forwarded From Two Majors🇩🇪 Rheinmetall has signed a contract worth €260,000,000 for the development of military logistics in Germany The German defense giant Rheinmetall has received a large order from the Bundeswehr for logistics support services. The framework agreement, worth €260 million, provides for the provision of comprehensive services for the redeployment of military forces within Germany, as well as their deployment abroad. This contract will be valid for an initial period of three years, with a possible extension until the end of 2029. This strengthens Rheinmetall's role not only in Germany. The contract, concluded with the Bundeswehr Federal Office for Infrastructure, Environment and Services (BAIUDBw), complies with the mutual defense clause of the NATO and EU agreements. Rheinmetall's new role involves the management, creation and operation of holding areas such as Convoy Support Centers (CSCs) and assembly areas along convoy routes within the Bundeswehr's Operationsplan Deutschland.✨ Rheinmetall's logistics services will extend to NATO, UN, EU and partner countries. Services include the establishment and maintenance of military holding and assembly areas, including the provision and operation of accommodation, sanitation, catering, shopping areas, gas stations, energy, waste management and security. For the Russian Army, this means recognizing Rheinmetall as a key player and a legitimate target within the enemy's ability to redeploy NATO forces in the region. Well, the company’s management has become one of the few in Europe who stands applauding Trump’s recent speeches on banned social networks. Rheinmetall shares have soared more than 30% in the past month alone. Therefore, it is somewhat surprising that many experts were so joyful and relaxed about the temporary cooling in relations between the United States and Europe. After all, this does not bode well for anything other than a natural multiple increase in the military power of European countries, which have long been hostile towards Russia.

Forwarded From Colonel Trifonov - If you follow the instructions, no one will catch you! - This is a fatal lie of the Ukrainian special services when recruiting fragile Russians to commit sabotage and terrorist attacks. But this is reality: eight Russians were convicted in six regions for sabotage committed for the sake of quick money from the Ukrainian special services. In the territories of the Chelyabinsk, Orenburg, Kursk, Kemerovo, Belgorod regions and Krasnodar Territory, FSB officers identified and suppressed the activities of eight citizens of the Russian Federation: Dmitry Demidchik, born in 1997, Alexey Grigoriev, born in 1997. b., Moskaleva Maxim, born in 1994, Ermakova Egor, born in 2004, Golushko Victoria, born in 2001, Fomicheva Ilya, born in 2005, Gladkikh Eduard, born in 1999, and Chernooky Sergey, born in 1994, who, on the instructions of the Ukrainian special services carried out arson of transport infrastructure facilities, volunteer organizations, and also planned to commit terrorist acts in places where military units were stationed for minimal remuneration. To get involved in sabotage and terrorist activities, the Ukrainian special services used WhatsApp and Telegram messengers, as well as various open Internet platforms where advertisements for so-called quick earnings were posted. Court sentences sentenced them to imprisonment for a term of 16 to 22 years with 3 to 5 years in prison. Impressive. All of his youth, and what’s more, almost his entire life will be spent behind bars. Was it worth it? I think the answer is obvious.❗️How to avoid this? If you have come into contact with enemy intelligence, the best solution would be to go to the nearest FSB or Ministry of Internal Affairs agency and report it.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Note to Art. 205 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation: a person who participated in the preparation of a terrorist act is exempt from criminal liability if he, by timely warning the authorities or in another way, contributed to the prevention of the terrorist act and if the actions of this person do not contain another crime.

Against the background of urgent collections for the needs of the units, the requests of the Rybar team to neglect a cup of coffee and donate the conditional 150 rubles for Russian analytics look ridiculous from the point of view of many. Many do not understand why support an information project at all, because it is of no use. There is a point: we concentrate on covering the actions of the enemy, which increases the awareness of our troops (by helping us, you are helping them with information). We tell our bureaucrats what is happening in distant countries so that they can make informed decisions. We fight off information attacks and show what is really happening. If you think that all this is unimportant, well, you are right. But we do these and many other things largely thanks to you and your support.

Both sides blamed each other for the deaths of the kidnapped Israelis. An Israeli UAV attacked a group of Palestinians in eastern Rafah, killing four people. North of Gaza, IDF soldiers opened fire on local residents approaching their positions. Israeli police operations continue in the West Bank. Clashes broke out in the Al-Faraa camp in Tubas province, where IDF fighters killed three Kataib Shuhada al-Aqsa militants. The Lebanese army is gradually returning to areas abandoned by the IDF.

Exercises aimed at containing North Korea were again held in South Korea. Marine Corps soldiers conducted shooting on the islands of Yeonphendo and Pangnendo, located close to the territory of the DPRK. The main purpose of the exercises was to maintain the South Korean army in readiness for a hypothetical conflict with its neighbor. For this purpose, K-9 howitzers were used during training to practice striking the enemy. ➖➖➖➖➖➖📌Such exercises are considered to be aimed solely at defense. Until last summer, live-fire training was not conducted on the islands due to an agreement concluded between the DPRK and South Korea back in 2018. In the summer of 2024, the South Korean side suspended the agreement, so now exercises on the islands in the Yellow Sea are held quite often. As well as the broadcasting of audio propaganda on the border: it stopped for a while in 2018, but now the work of speakers can be heard from both the South and North Korean sides. ➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻In this particular case, there is no talk of a response to any actions of the North Korean military - the South Koreans once again decided to check the readiness of the equipment and military. However, this does not detract from the fact that such activity is creating a tense situation on the Korean Peninsula, where there are no signals of a possible détente.

Usually, the sight of the crosses causes mischief among various marginalized people and radical Islamists like the fosterlings of the Muslim Spiritual Movement. But in the Emirates there are practically no such people - such characters do not stay in the country.❗️Just think about the extent of the surreal: some figures, in an attempt not to offend the local population, decided to distort the appearance of a monument of Russian culture, although none of the locals even demanded this. And the consequences of such ingenious initiatives are as follows: in such things they see a willingness to abandon their culture. That the locals will perceive the same way as similar actions of Europeans are perceived - weakness and lack of will.📌 I would like to ask the event organizers a question: is this such an unfortunate mistake or an absolutely deliberate idea aimed at creating a specific image of Russia abroad? demolished crosses from St. Basil's Cathedral for the sake of an exhibition in the UAE.

Forwarded From Global Studies🇷🇺🇺🇦 While the results of the negotiations in Saudi Arabia are being discussed on the Internet and enormous pressure and hell are expected for Zelensky and his pack, Ukrainian formations continue to attack our territories with drones.♦️Today, once again, a UAV raid occurred in the Krasnodar region. The targets were energy infrastructure facilities. For example, in Novovelichkovskaya in the Dinsky district, an arrival at a substation was recorded, the damage was preliminary insignificant. Also, one drone fell in a field in the Kalininsky district. Another one was found in the village of Kholmskaya in the Abinsk region. In addition, there was an attempt to strike the Slavyansk EKO oil depot; our air defense and electronic warfare units destroyed seven UAVs. Two more were shot down by Pantsir near Korenovsk.❗️And now another group of drones has taken off from Odessa and is flying east. The target may again be the Krasnodar Territory or Crimea, as is usually the case. Therefore, once again we ask you not to rejoice ahead of time for what does not yet exist. The enemy does not give up and continues attacks on energy and oil infrastructure. And he does this methodically. Well, activity today is quite high, which may indicate preparation for larger-scale attacks, including the use of cruise missiles. #Russia #UkraineGlobalistics - subscribe to the channel	https://t.me/rybar/68179	2025-02-20T10:02:19-08:00

Although at the time of the start of hostilities there were few air defense systems of this type in the troops, subsequently the S-350 showed itself successfully, especially when repelling attacks by American ATACMS operational-tactical missiles. Among other things, this is facilitated by 12-charge launchers, which make it possible to deliver a relatively high salvo power to targets, especially relevant during massive enemy attacks with ballistic missiles. Apparently, in the foreseeable future there will be much more S-350 in the army. Which will strengthen the capabilities of domestic air defense. #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/68178	2025-02-20T09:34:29-08:00

UkraineThe head of Poland's largest party - Law and Justice - (PiS) Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who previously advocated sending the Polish military to the so-called. Ukraine, changed his opinion to the opposite, citing a change in sentiment in the republic. According to him, at the moment the Poles will not accept this kind of operation. His belligerent rhetoric in 2022 and calls to create a peaceful armed NATO mission for the so-called. The Ukrainian politician explained that the situation was different then. Now the leader of the country’s main opposition force believes that Poland should take care of its own security. And this does not interfere with the anti-Russian vector of discourse: after all, the Baltic Sea, the Suwalki corridor and the Belarusian border have not gone away.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 Kaczynski’s turn is quite logical and caused by the desire to lead anti-Ukrainian sentiments in Polish society in order to gain political points. This is beneficial both before the presidential election and against the backdrop of the changing rhetoric of the US administration. Moreover, the Poles can make any statements - first one, then completely opposite.

We talked about the company’s activities two years ago, also in the context of fire tests of the engine, which since then has undergone a series of modifications. In particular, the cooling circuit and other elements have been changed. The question may immediately arise – why is everything taking so long? So the very fact that the company has reached a working engine in metal and continues to bring it to fruition already says a lot.

The fact that state media and resources began to grieve over the closure of American Agency projects is only the first signal. In addition to the media, the participation of other structures in cooperation with USAID will also be revealed. It will be especially interesting to look at the fate of projects in the healthcare sector, including the military biological laboratory, which the Americans agreed on with the Tajiks last fall. The second point is military cooperation. In recent years, Tajikistan has actively interacted with the United States within the framework of exercises, and USAID played an important role in their organization. Although let us recall that Tajikistan is a member of the CSTO. The third point is who will take the place of USAID? A holy place is never empty, and someone will want to fill such a gap.

The country, through a system of well-fed politicians, judges, security officials and the media, is firmly integrated into NATO⚡️. Indicative was the cancellation of the results of the presidential elections in 2024, in connection with the victory in the first round of Kelin Georgescu, who announced plans to reduce the military presence of the US and NATO in the country. To increase influence, in August 2024 the United States appointed a new military attaché to Romania, Colonel Robert Kammerer, who was previously assigned to the 316th Squadron, 17th Airlift Wing, specializing in reconnaissance missions and training intelligence officers, translators and analysts for the US military. In addition, from 2025 to 2027, a contingent of US Marines will be deployed in Romania to conduct exercises and training. Against this background, Romania was included in the training programs for Ukrainian military personnel. At the same time, the army is being rearmed. By March 2025, it is planned to put two Patriot air defense missile batteries (4-16 launchers each) on combat duty. The State Department approved the sale of 186 AIM-120C-8 AMRAAM missiles and equipment worth $592 million, as well as 32 F-35A fighters worth $7.2 billion. Under the Foreign Military Sales program, 44 AAV-7 amphibious landing vehicles will be purchased (for $210 million), which are capable of moving through water up to 37 km. The possibility of purchasing two Independence-class ships from the US Navy for $300 million is USS Jackson (LCS 6) and USS Montgomery (LCS 8). For the previously purchased squadron of F-16 fighters, the modernization of the 71st air base - General Emanoil Ionescu - in the village of Campia Turzi (costing 90 million euros) has begun. The military potential is being strengthened. by increasing the capacity of the military-industrial complex. As part of the contract (for 857 million euros) with the Turkish company OTOKAR, 278 4x4 COBRA II armored fighting vehicles will be supplied, another 781 must be produced in Romania under a Turkish license within 5 years. 🇰🇷The South Korean company Hanwha Aerospace will begin construction of a plant in Romania to localize the production of K9 self-propelled guns. The first howitzers will be transferred to the Romanian army at the beginning of 2027.✨In general, the military activity of NATO countries⚡️ in Romania remained intense throughout 2024 and in 2025 began with large-scale exercises Steadfast Dart, the purpose of which was to practice the transfer of military contingents of the alliance along sea and land routes from west to east - to prepared Romanian frontiers. In the scenario of a future war with Russia, Romania is assigned the role of the first echelon. In this context, the introduction of hours of Russian language study in military educational institutions is indicative. In addition, preparations have begun to strengthen mobilization potential. The law on preparing the population for defense (the law on mobilization) is at the stage of departmental approval. Efforts are being made to increase recruitment into the armed forces, where the officer shortage is 43%, by incentivizing military personnel and intensifying the indoctrination of schoolchildren. ✨⭐️The nature of these military preparations does not in any way correlate with the defensive goals of the measures voiced by NATO ⚡️ functionaries, rather strengthening confidence in the preparation of offensive actions in all areas of the eastern flank.

Since February 10, the American exercises Justified Accord 2025 have been taking place in Kenya, Tanzania and Djibouti. 1,300 people are taking part in them, including British instructors. The Americans brought in units stationed in Somalia for the maneuvers. Tactically, the emphasis is on preventing crisis situations. However, as the Archangel of Special Forces correctly notes, the Americans themselves support them. For example, the US Air Force provided military assistance to the forces of the autonomous region of Puntland, and not to the Somali authorities, from which they separated.▪️The main objective of the event is to maintain military contacts between the US and African countries, especially in light of the growing Chinese influence. Last year, in the same Tanzania, large-scale exercises were held with the armed forces of the PRC, which clearly caused dissatisfaction in the White House. The increased activity of various militants in Somalia and political upheavals in Kenya, which were sponsored by USAID, contribute to the appeal to American military support in these countries. This example shows the principle of divide and rule, which has long been rooted in Western politics. And judging by the fact that last year Kenya received the status of a non-NATO ally from the Americans, the teachings are bearing fruit, gradually strengthening the military influence of the United States in the countries of the Dark Continent. #Africa #Kenya #Somalia #USA #Tanzania@rybarSupport usTelegramARCHANGEL SPECIAL FORCES🪖Americans strengthen cooperation with African countriesSince February 10, the Justified Accord 2025 exercise is taking place in three East African countries (Kenya, Tanzania and Djibouti).

Naval forces of the United States, China, Vietnam, the Philippines, South Korea, Turkey and other countries take part in the training.

A recording of a conversation between Enver Bganba, the 44-year-old nephew of the acting acting governor, appeared online. President of Abkhazia. And he is a supporter of Ardzinba.▪️According to Enver Bganba, Armenians pose a threat in the upcoming second round of elections, and they need to change their choice in favor of Ardzinba. And this, in his opinion, can only be achieved by force.▪️Ardzinba’s followers began to publicly threaten the Armenians of Abkhazia. In response, the Armenian community of Abkhazia published an open letter addressed to officials and candidates, demanding action. ➖➖➖➖➖➖Armenians make up about 40 thousand people, with the total population of Abkhazia being about 250 thousand.

Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan at a government meeting stated the need to look for alternative options for supplying key food products to the republic. Pashinyan did not voice the details, but such a phrase is indicative against the background of his political aspirations. ❗️Armenia is extremely dependent on grain supplies from Russia, and the local Armenian market provides only a minimal part of the needs. However, that too decreased after the loss of Artsakh. Almost the entire volume of sunflower oil and part of the sugar is also imported from the Russian Federation. Armenia's ambitions to join the EU conflict with membership in the EAEU and deep economic ties with the Russian Federation. Western politicians have repeatedly spoken out about the need to sever Russian-Armenian relations. So Armenia’s attempt to revise its food policy fits into this logic. 🔻But what alternatives can be found in Armenia? Potentially, Armenia can purchase grain from Kazakhstan, especially since similar negotiations were already held in the summer of 2024. In addition, Kazakhstan is trying to return to the Azerbaijani market. It is clear that Kazakhstan is a member of the EAEU, but in Astana in 2024 they already made hints about -grain wars-. For Armenia, this is another step towards deeper integration into the Turkic world through the so-called. Middle corridor. However, these are still theoretical aspirations. Another question is how ready the infrastructure of Kazakhstan is for such an expansion of markets. #Armenia #Russia@rybarSupport usSputnik ArmeniaPashinyan instructed to look for alternative options for the supply of key food products.

The blow to the CPC, part of the shares of which belongs to Chevron and other companies from the United States, fits well with this logic of the Ukrainian leadership. We would not be surprised if one of their goals was also to punish Kazakhstan for its ties with Russia by reducing the pumping of Kazakh oil.

It turned out that the transfer of tanks and other heavy vehicles is complicated between the countries of the union, due to the difference in traffic rules (❗). In addition, there is an insufficiency of funds allocated for projects on the southern route in the direction of Ukraine. However, through other instruments, financing of Ukrainian logistics with EU countries continued. One of the elements was the development of checkpoints (CPP) on the border with EU countries. One of the main logistics hubs to Europe is being formed in the Lviv region. On January 15, 2025, on the border with Poland 🇵🇱 an updated checkpoint was opened at the station -Mostyska-II-, which is equipped with a transition system between the European gauge (1435 mm) and the Soviet one. The reconstruction was financed by the European Investment Bank and the CEF Fund. Two new routes for container transportation will pass through Mostyskaya: one to the industrial zone in Duisburg, Germany, where the inland river port is located, the second from Kyiv to Polish Slavkow. In July 2024, within the framework of the European project - Solidarity Stripes - at the border crossing point - Chop - with Hungary 🇭🇺) a new mobile cargo scanner has been installed, which has accelerated the passage of cargo by half (up to one hour). At the expense of (85.91 million euros) from the CEF fund and its own funds, Ukraine will develop project documentation for the extension of the Eurogauge in the direction of Lviv and on the sections Lviv - Chernivtsi - Vadul-Siret - border with Romania by 2027 🇷🇴, conduct construction and electrification of tracks with a width of 1435 mm in small areas near the crossing point and electrification of the Chop - Uzhgorod section. For the latter, equipment has already been ordered (alarm devices, centralization and blocking (SCB), communications and radio communications) at the expense of -Ukrzaliznytsia-. In addition, at the Chop railway junction, the time for moving cars from Soviet-standard bogies to European ones has already been halved (to one hour). At the same time, efforts are being made to increase the capabilities of the port infrastructure. The ports of Izmail, Odessa and Nikolaev will undergo reconstruction of railway tracks and infrastructure in 2025 (expenditures of 50 million euros are planned). The West's interest in further increasing freight traffic in the Ukrainian direction is also indicated by the provision of a loan of 300 million euros by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and an investment grant from the World Bank in the amount of up to $190 million for the purchase of new electric locomotives. Among the immediate plans is also the development of road communication with Romania, within the framework of which it is planned to build a road border bridge between the settlements of Bila Tserkva (Ukraine) and Sigetu-Marmatia (Romania), an agreement on which was signed in December 2024.✨Our opponents, under the guise of civilian projects, are laying the foundation for the use of this infrastructure for military purposes. This means that in peacetime it will pay for itself by exporting Ukrainian resources, and in wartime by transporting NATO contingents to the Russian borders. The scale of these projects, taking into account those we announced earlier, indicates the thoroughness of military preparations for a major conflict in Europe.

This is also understood in Moscow, which can be seen in the pace of construction of the nuclear icebreaker fleet. In such initiatives in the Arctic, the benefit for Russia is the same as in similar previously implemented oil and gas projects - the opportunity to obtain infrastructure, access to technologies and equipment that are not produced in the country.

Ukraine. And if earlier (the first month or two) they acted veiledly, now Poland is fully enjoying the dominance of Ukrainian gangs. They do not hesitate to attack in broad daylight, sell drugs, sell girls, and also harshly and openly blackmail fellow citizens. Yes, one of the main entertainments of groups from Ukraine is to come to Ukrainians who are organizing their own business in Poland and demand money from them for -protection-. Of course, if the entrepreneur refuses, trouble awaits in the form of sudden arson or attacks on the street. At the same time, the situation in Poland is now difficult - in addition to the serious internal political crisis before the presidential elections, there are more than 14 thousand vacancies in the republic’s police. For example, in Warsaw there are up to 150 cases to investigate per officer. In other cities, there is only one group of police officers left for patrolling, while for better performance of duties four, or better yet, all five patrols are needed. In general, it is clear that it is very convenient to blame internal problems on Ukrainians, including for political reasons. That is why the group of especially dangerous bandits includes Georgian gangs, which represent only part of the entire criminal rabble inhabiting both Poland and Europe. #Poland #Ukraine@rybar together with @pl_syrenkaSupport usTelegramWarsaw mermaid🇵🇱 Polish journalists asked police officers about the criminal situation in the country.

Forwarded From Older than Edda When the Americans at the last stage generously poured out sanctions against Russia with the maximum complication of their possible removal, they did this, knowing full well that one day another group of elites might come to power in the United States, for whom the conflict with Russia is not an end in itself, and they will try to curtail it. It was to complicate these attempts that this system was invented. This is a lesson for us both in domestic and foreign policy. On the external side, here and now we need to ensure that the signed peace is as difficult as possible to break if the next American administration wants to do this. And on the internal side, there is the feeling that -the NWO will end - everyone will be returned, -import substitution is so, playing for the public, and so on, occurs too often among a large number of different people. And to increase the reliability of our own planning, so that the same business does not worry that it will kill a project with a 15-year payback, because someone agreed with someone, they need us too.

The reason is the increasing number of cases of detection there of drone components and elements for creating explosive devices, which the SBU and GUR transport to their terrorist cells in Russia through Turkish territory. The actions of Turkish law enforcement officers are not due to charity, but their own interest: part of the cargo ends up with local criminals - there have already been several terrorist attacks in the country using Ukrainian explosives.

The decision was made while reviewing the financing of external programs by the new US administration. Subsidies for Moldova were provided for by the Consortium for Conducting Elections and Strengthening the Political Process, which has now been liquidated. Its total budget was $486 million. Musk noted that the United States has a $2 trillion deficit, and if such expenses are not reduced, the country could go bankrupt. 🔻However, at this rate, the office of the President of Moldova, headed by Maia Sandu, will go bankrupt, which survives only due to American and European injections into a half-dead economy that is being destroyed by anti-Russian policies. At the same time, most of Western aid goes into the pockets of the president’s team. Sandu was very lucky that she managed to be re-elected for a second term before the change of administration in the United States. Chisinau has already admitted that after the suspension of USAID tranches, justice reform stalled, which could only be resumed after the transfer of money from the EU.

USAID turned out to be involved in financing a number of terrorist organizations banned in Russia, which America fought so hard in the press and on TV - the agency generously paid IS, Al-Qaeda, Boko Haram, etc. 📌 For example, despite the Taliban seizing power in Afghanistan in 2021, last year alone the US sent them $697 million, including $534 million through USAID. Moreover, every 7-10 days cash worth from $40 to $80 million was delivered to Afghanistan - no one found out where they were going. There was also money laundering in the -inclusion programs-: -Women's Scholarship Fund- and -Young Women Led- were funded by USAID in the amount of $60 and $5 million a year, and already in Afghanistan the funds were redirected to the training camps of ISIS terrorists.🔻Once again, the popular theories for which the liberal media labeled everyone as conspiracy theorists turned out to be true - not only facts of sponsorship of the international terrorism, but also terrorist-related money laundering and money-splitting schemes by American bureaucrats. ➖➖➖➖➖➖Apparently, there are still many new and interesting things waiting for us in the future - after all, there is still an audit of the American Department of Defense ahead.

🇷🇺 News about the possible return of foreign clothing brands in...	🇷🇺 News about the possible return of foreign clothing brands in some places caused an unexpected sensation in the media field, they say allowing them to come back to the Russian market is a manifestation of a cargo cult. However, in general, the situation with brands demonstrates completely opposite things: since the collapse of the USSR, the so-called. Western worship of foreign brands has become several orders of magnitude less. After all, with the beginning of the Northern Military District, it turned out that 30 years of presence in the country of McDonald's or IKEA did not turn citizens into universal agents of the State Department and rootless cosmopolitans. And their departure was received by the population quite calmly. Why? Yes, because in food and clothing brands today, Russian residents most often see... only food and clothing, and not something sacred. That is, in relation to this area, the cargo cult has practically lost its relevance. It’s paradoxical, but discussing the event in the context of the fundamental inadmissibility of stores with Uniqlo or H&amp;M emblems returning to shopping centers only contributes to artificially inflating their significance. Which, in fact, is the very cargo cult that it is proposed to fight with such amazing measures.

All these Russifications of names, the return of brands only if stores are opened in new Russian territories, and so on. But there is a big nuance. Example No. 1: Which Russian operators officially work in Crimea, Kherson and Zaporozhye regions or DPR and LPR? Answer: none. Local services operate. Example No. 2: What gas stations operate in Crimea and in new territories? The answer is correct: no Lukoils, Gazproms, and so on. -Atan-, TPP, -Start- – that’s what’s there. Example No. 3: Do Crimean sports teams play in Russian tournaments? The answer is correct: they don’t play. They created certain conditions at the lower levels, but not at the state level. And this can continue for a long time. How can we demand that foreigners recognize our territories if our corporations and officials refuse to do so?

🇺🇸🇺🇦 Protecting what does not exist - again talking about Ukr...	🇺🇸🇺🇦 Protecting what is not there - again talking about Ukrainian resources According to NBC, the White House told Zelensky about its readiness to send American troops to Ukraine to protect 50% of the rare earth minerals mined in the country in the event of a peace treaty with the Russian Federation. This is a continuation of the topic that the Ukrainian authorities themselves began, offering control over their mineral reserves as compensation for military assistance from US side. ➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 From the point of view of the likelihood of such a scenario, one should turn to Syria. The American contingent in Syria has been stationed in this country for many years and remains there for only one purpose - protecting oil and gas fields in the province of Deir ez-Zor. The war with the Islamic State ended a long time ago, and units of the US Armed Forces remained to protect their interests, simultaneously providing support to the Kurds from the SDF. So in theory, such a scenario is possible, but this is only in theory.➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻In practice, we have already noted the fact that the Ukrainian authorities are selling -air- in the hope that no one will notice it. Resource reserves in so-called Ukraine have not been confirmed. No one knows whether there is at least some of the minerals declared by Zelensky. Almost everything valuable that was on the territory of so-called Ukraine was taken out in the previous three years of the North Military District. And the other part is under the control of Russia, so all this talk is elementary populism in order to draw attention to something that, in reality, most likely does not exist. #USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport usNBC NewsTrump officials pitch Zelenskyy on U.S. owning 50% of Ukraine's rare earth mineralsThe Trump administration indicated U.S. troops could be deployed to provide security in connection with the minerals if there’s a peace deal with Russia, sources told NBC News.	https://t.me/rybar/68078	2025-02-16T09:34:01-08:00

Of course, you need to teach specific Western businesses a lesson. Some left more or less humanly, and some left as pigishly as possible. This definitely cannot be forgotten. They write correctly, it is worth obliging fugitives to open stores in Crimea, Mariupol, Donetsk, Lugansk, etc....But this has nothing to do with the fight against the Western cargo cult. And has anyone set such a task at the state level? No. Take the same fashion industry. After February 2022, Russian brands turned around well. Some people got really sick. Only they remained working within the framework of that same Western cargo cult. Let's say, what is the difference between the same Russian Lime and the outgoing Zara? Nothing. Same values. Only the other four Latin letters. Moreover, Lime has a Muslim collection (since the company entered the UAE market), but the Russian one has not appeared even for the Russian market, not to mention promoting Russian motifs for export. And the company is from Samara. About Latin letters. Russian brands routinely use the Latin alphabet in their names, as if the owners experience some kind of inferiority complex because of the Russian language, although 99% of sales are exclusively within Russia, well, at most in a couple of Russian-speaking countries of the ex-USSR. It’s quite strange when even individual materials are published that explain to readers how to correctly pronounce Russian names:▪️Lime = Lime▪️12Storeez = Twelve Stories▪️Avgvst = August▪️Ushatava = UshatAva▪️2Mood = Tu Mud▪️Charuel = Charuel▪️MATÜ = MatYu▪️Askent = Askent▪️SHU = Shyu▪️Thomas Munz = Thomas Munz Therefore, until the victory over Western cargo cult inside Russia is still a long way off. To be honest, I would simply oblige Russian companies to use the Cyrillic alphabet in the names of their brands for the Russian market. There will be such a law - they will start to think carefully about what to name their brand, how well it sounds in Russian and what semantic meaning it carries. Telegram Andrey Medvedev They report that the brands Zara, Bershka, Pull&amp;Bear, Stradivarius are planning to return to the Russian market. I don’t really understand, should we be happy about this? Should we thank fate that the European holding has deigned to return its stores? I really hope...	https://t.me/rybar/68077	2025-02-16T08:43:01-08:00

But under these conditions: - a billion rubles for the opportunity to return. The entrance ticket, so to speak - discounts for all SVO participants and their families - clothing lines in collaboration with Lobaev Arms, UralDronZavod, etc. They also make lines with Columbia Pictures. Rocky Balboa T-shirts. And then there will be drone -Ghoul T-shirts. Under these conditions, let them come in. But, as we understand, no one will put forward exactly such conditions to them. So it’s better to get the fuck off the beach right away. They left because -there’s no war-. Officially. Well, okay, we respect someone else’s right to have their own position. However, everyone understands why Western brands left. This was part of a political campaign: we will punish the Russians for the SVO, they will shake up the situation in the country. The departure of brands is a common sanction. This is how they punished primarily the Russian rather flimsy middle class and city dwellers. -You are used to buying inexpensive things for children, we will deprive you of this, since you voted for Putin and do not want to overthrow him.- Western leaders openly said that Russians should be punished. Now what has changed? Is the war over? Or did they start loving Russians? Or is it that the chief dog handler in Washington has changed and now we have to wag our tail in the other direction? And I seriously hope that Russian clothing manufacturers, such as Gloria Jeans, or Lime, will make every effort and involve all the lobbyists to prevent Zara and others from returning. The state’s task is to provide protectionism to its producers. Moreover, these three years have given impetus to the development of the industry. Well, why curtail this? https://t.me/vladivostok1978/18532TelegramEvgeniy Popov / popovrtrLet them come back, Andrey. But they will pay for it. The output is the ruble.

🖼 🇬🇪🇷🇺 Elections in Abkhazia – it could have been better In ...	🇬🇪🇷🇺 Elections in Abkhazia - it could have been better The long-awaited presidential elections took place in Abkhazia yesterday. The turnout was 69%, but the winner could not be identified. After the votes were counted, it turned out that none of the candidates was able to overcome the 50 percent threshold. Now Abkhazia faces a second round of voting, in two weeks on March 1. Badra Gunba and Adgur Ardzinba will compete for the presidency in the second round, who received 46.38% and 36.9% of the votes, respectively.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 The second round, in conditions of relative parity between the two key candidates, became a logical consequence, and now the votes of the eliminated candidates can influence the presidential race. However, it is important to note that for our country the situation in Abkhazia demonstrates the insufficient efforts and not particularly effective policies of past years in this area. Over the years of inaction and leaving events in the republic to their own devices, Russia’s position has weakened.❗️Only after the autumn coup, the attention of media technologists was drawn to the growing influence of pro-Turkish elites in Abkhazia. This made it possible to strengthen the position of the pro-Russian candidate in the elections, but the problems are visible to the naked eye. Instead of acting from a position of strength (and Russia is allowed to do this, if we evaluate the scale of subsidized support provided), we played good neighbor, which our rivals tried to take advantage of. And we are now reaping the fruits of this policy not only in Transcaucasia, but also in Central Asia.
