The enemy is not giving up attempts to advance deeper into the Kursk region and is transferring forces to gain a foothold in the occupied territories. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, footage appeared with members of Ukrainian formations in the center of the village of Vnezapnoye, although information about the enemy’s presence there appeared yesterday. Given the location of the village on the western bank of the Blyakhovets River, the Ukrainian Armed Forces may also be present in the village of Gordeevka, while the status of Viktorovka and Uspenivka remains in question. However, there were still no reports of fighting in Byakhovo. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, the situation still remains tense and hidden - the fog of war -. Ukrainian media continue to publish stories about -control- over Sudzha, posting footage from the western outskirts and the center. 🔻In the Belovsky district during the day, information appeared about high enemy activity, but there was no confirmation of this. Also late in the evening, the acting governor of the region announced the mandatory evacuation of the village of Glushkovo.

In the south of the Gaza Strip, IDF units carried out engineering work in the vicinity of Rafah and Khan Yunis. Also recorded&nbsp; shootouts in Tell al-Sultan. In the West Bank, Israeli security forces carried out an operation in Tubas and other localities, during which a member of the local branch of the military wing of Hamas was eliminated. At the same time, four IDF soldiers were injured due to an armored car being blown up by an IED. On the Lebanese-Israeli border, Hezbollah fired another salvo at Israel, hitting the outskirts of Kiryat Shmona. In turn, an IDF drone struck Al-Abbasiya, resulting in 17 casualties.🔻A detailed analytical report on events in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_botHigh resolution mapEnglish version#digest #map #Israel #Palestine #report@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62782	2024-08-14T11:03:50-07:00

The Israelis let them in front of them into potentially mined tunnels and buildings as -anthropomorphic mine sweeps-. The IDF mainly used Palestinians accused of having links with militants, but sometimes also involved ordinary civilians, including the elderly and teenagers. They were dressed in Israeli military uniforms in order to lure out Hamas fire, and they were also fitted with body cameras for remote surveillance. According to journalists, the IDF command, right down to the Chief of the General Staff, was well aware of this practice and saw nothing wrong with it. At the same time, captured Palestinians were promised release from custody for carrying out such missions. 📌 Needless to say, such methods are prohibited by all possible conventions. However, over the past year, the ruling Israeli authorities have publicly demonstrated their contempt for them more than once, and the collective West and international organizations have traditionally been in no hurry to introduce any real sanctions against Israel. Well, it’s no longer surprising that such an attitude towards the residents of the Gaza Strip on the part of the IDF has to - this fully fits into the policy of the current ultra-Orthodox Israeli government, whose members previously directly called the Palestinians -animals-.#Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport usThe Times of IsraelReport: IDF using Gazans to check areas that may be booby-trapped before troops enterSoldiers tell Israeli newspaper that commanders send Palestinian civilians into tunnels and buildings they fear are rigged, claim chief of staff and top brass aware of practice	https://t.me/rybar/62781	2024-08-14T09:44:32-07:00
🔁🖼 ⚡️NATO is trying to increase the number of units for the war...	Forwarded From Two Majors ⚡️NATO is trying to increase the staffing of units for the war with Russia. According to Reuters, the Alliance countries are looking for urgent ways to additionally recruit into the ranks of the armed forces. 🇨🇿In the Czech Republic, on the basis of the 4th Rapid Deployment Brigade (headquarters in Žatec, 50% staffing), a military training program for 80 high school students has been launched. In addition, from September 1, 2024, the Czech Ministry of Defense is reducing the medical requirements for military personnel, reservists and recruits. In 🇵🇱 Poland, from whose armed forces 9 thousand contract soldiers left in 2023, a conscription campaign has been launched - Vacations with the army -, which involves basic military training of citizens aged 18 to 35 years within 28 days.🇭🇺The Hungarian Armed Forces took the path of popularizing the service and launched a media campaign, visual street advertising and the creation of a military series. 🇷🇴In Romania, the government announced recruitment for military service after 43% of officer and 23% of soldier positions remained vacant. The shortage has left two Patriot air defense batteries completely short-staffed, as well as pilots for the newly purchased F-16 aircraft. Romanians are considering taking emergency measures to increase wages and expand social benefits. Earlier, in July 2024, Reuters reported ⚡️NATO plans to form from 35 to 50 additional brigades (each from 3 to 7 thousand troops) to implement its new plans in terms of attack - defense against attack from Russia -.✨ Well, while NATO is trying to push its citizens into the army, the war is being waged by the hands of Ukraine. In this way, cheap Ukrainian slaves are used, and the Alliance gains time to prepare an attack and wears down the combat potential of the future enemy. ✨⭐️Such articles in Western countries, first of all, are aimed at obtaining additional budgets for military spending. But no one can cancel the obvious fact of NATO’s preparation for war with Russia. Two majors	https://t.me/rybar/62780	2024-08-14T09:21:56-07:00

Also pleasing is the abundance of footage of dejected counter-attackers - they decided not to publish them on their channel, but we recommend them to connoisseurs (with a strong psyche) who for some reason have not seen them yet scroll through the channels listed below (we are also seeing more and more captured invaders). @belarusian_silovik@warhistoryalconafter@ukraina_ru@rosich_russia	https://t.me/rybar/62770	2024-08-14T08:44:21-07:00

There has also been a noticeable increase in the number of videos showing the defeat of enemy personnel and armored vehicles.🔻There are no changes in the Korenevsky district. Russian troops are still holding Korenevo, while Ukrainian formations are trying to bypass the settlement from the south and north, undertaking -swoops-.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, based on the emerging footage and statements of the Russian Ministry of Defense, the enemy tried to attack in the area of ​​​​Skrylevka and Kauchuk, however not very successful. At the same time, there were no statements about the liberation of settlements located in the gray zone. ▪️In Martynovka, fighters of the Russian Armed Forces captured a group of enemy infantry, which confirms the repulsion of an attack by Ukrainian formations. However, Mikhailovka, apparently, remains under enemy control, and several settlements north of Sudzha remain in the gray zone. ▪️Several more members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces were captured near the village of Ulanok. At the same time, there were no reports of battles or advances from Fanaseevka, which means the enemy attacked from the area of ​​the village of Borki, which is currently located in the gray zone. In the Belovsky district, the situation remains mostly hidden - the fog of war-. Footage of attacks on Ukrainian formations in the vicinity of Girya appears on the Internet, but with a high probability they are archival, and the events captured there took place in the past 24 hours. In the village of Kamyshnoye, an enemy assault group was hit by an artillery strike. At the same time, it is unknown whether the settlement was subsequently cleared, so the status of the village and neighboring Krupets formally remains in question.

At the same time, the media resources of the Yemeni organization have not yet taken responsibility.▪️According to British monitoring sites, the Houthis tried to hit the Delta Atlantica tanker sailing under the flag of Liberia with an unmanned boat. However, the ship continued sailing to Greece.▪️The second attack using BeK occurred in the Gulf of Aden. The On Phoenix tanker came under attack, received minor damage and also continued on its way to Holland. Meanwhile, the US Central Command reported the destruction of two naval drones in the Red Sea. Apparently, the Americans were still able to detect several Houthi vehicles, but were unable to intercept the rest, which resulted in damage to the On Phoenix vessel.

🔁 🇲🇳🇷🇺🇺🇸 From this academic year, the main foreign languag...	Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇲🇳🇷🇺🇺🇸 Starting this school year, English will become the main foreign language in Mongolian schools. This was announced by the country's new Minister of Education Purevsurengiin Naranbayar after a meeting on preparation for the school year. For now, lessons will be conducted in test mode in 100 schools from the third grade. English teachers will also be required to study abroad to obtain a master’s degree. 🔻In principle, nothing surprising happened: the Mongolian parliament passed a law back in 2023, according to which English became the main foreign language in schools. Guess what foreign language, previously taught in most schools, was the only one to study? Of course, Russian. And in order for the process of ousting the Russian to proceed more actively, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently visited Ulaanbaatar. During his visit, he announced his intention to create an English language center in Mongolia. 📌It is absolutely obvious that the decision made fits perfectly into the concept of capturing Mongolia into the orbit of foreign countries, thereby distancing it from the Russian Federation, simultaneously not only squeezing Russian business out of the republic, but also forming a Russophobic policy. Negative trends towards a reduction in the space of the Russian language in the country, although they began to develop back in the 90s, however, under the sensitive control of a mass of foreign organizations, they gained momentum. Typical tactics of Western lobbyists, including rewriting history and seizing government resources. #Russia #Mongolia #USA @pezdicide no chemistry - just factsgazeta-n1.ru In Mongolia, English will become the main foreign language for teaching, and English teachers will study abroad	https://t.me/rybar/62767	2024-08-14T06:18:52-07:00
🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦 Massive raid of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Russian...	🇷🇺🇺🇦&nbsp;Massive raid of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Russian regions Last night, Ukrainian formations carried out one of the largest-scale launches of drones in eight Russian regions: according to the Russian Ministry of Defense, a total of 117 drones and four missiles were intercepted. ▪️The main blow fell on the Voronezh region, where the first UAVs began to be shot down before midnight. Apparently, the main target of the enemy was the military airfields located in the region - Baltimore and Borisoglebsk. Currently, there is no objective evidence of damage to the facilities; we only know about damaged residential buildings, outbuildings and transport in Voronezh and Borisoglebsk. ▪️In the Nizhny Novgorod region, Ukrainian drones, including kamikaze UAVs -Lyuty-, attacked the Kulebaksky district - there is the Savasleika airfield, where MiG-31 fighters are based. After the raid, a section of the P72 road - Vladimir - Murom - Arzamas - was temporarily blocked. ▪️ In the Volgograd region, air defense systems worked in the area of ​​Uryupinsk and Novonikolaevsky - in the latter, according to several media reports, the electrical substation - Balashovskaya - was damaged, but local authorities denied this information. ▪️In the Kursk region, Russian air defense and electronic warfare systems disabled drones both in Kursk itself and in border areas. At the same time, enemy UAVs continue to attack cars on the highways, countering both the evacuation and the transfer of units of the Russian Armed Forces. ▪️In the Belgorod region, Shebekino came under attack from Ukrainian drones, where a residential building and the territory of an agricultural enterprise were damaged. One man was injured; he was taken to a hospital in Belgorod in serious condition with a mine explosion injury. ▪️Several more drones were intercepted in the Bryansk, Oryol and Rostov regions - according to the latest information, no damage was recorded there. 🔻Recently, Ukrainian formations have concentrated on attacks on military airfields - a few days ago an ammunition depot on the territory of Lipetsk-2 was hit, and last night three more objects were attacked, where, according to some data, there were also consequences. Massive raids have become more frequent. Russian regions demonstrate a high volume of drone production from the enemy, where the production of new UAVs completely covers the consumption of the devices during previous raids. At the same time, drones are often detected as they approach the border, but due to the still existing difficulties with organization, interaction and control, it is not possible to shoot down drones walking along the same corridors.

Despite rumors about the enemy’s capture of Viktorovka and Gordeevka in previous days, only firefights near Gordeevka have been confirmed so far. A group of enemy infantry was spotted in Krasnooktyabrsky yesterday, which apparently got there bypassing Snagosti. However, the status of both settlements remains unclear. ▪️Local battles continue in the vicinity of Korenevo and to the north. In addition, footage appeared online showing airstrikes on enemy concentrations at the time of the attack in the direction of a populated area - they were -covered- in a field two kilometers from Korenevo.🔻In the northern section of the wedge in the Sudzhansky district, the situation is also unchanged. Russian troops stopped the enemy near Kremyany and Kruglenkiy, and in the Malaya Loknya area, Russian troops captured several members of the 82nd infantry brigade and other enemy units. There are battles in Sudzha and the surrounding area, although the enemy claims complete control over the city.▪️Frames of captured Ukrainian equipment and equipment captured by Russian fighters continue to appear on the Internet. At the same time, from the enemy side, images emerge from settlements captured in previous days, including Plekhovo. 🔻In the Belovsky district, according to some data, the activity of enemy armored vehicles is again being recorded in the area of ​​​​the settlements of Girya and Belitsa. In fact, the front line, as Alexander Kharchenko notes, is almost stable. Enemy units operate within the boundaries of a previously formed gray zone and at the current moment cannot advance, although they do not stop trying.
