In the Hamad residential complex adjacent to Khan Yunis, an Israeli armored personnel carrier opened fire on a group of journalists who were filming the consequences of a ground operation by the Israel Defense Forces in this area. As a result, Journalist Ibrahim Muhareb was killed in the shooting. His colleague Salma al-Qaddumi was wounded in the back; she is currently receiving medical care in the Nasser hospital, where there is practically no medicine left. It is noteworthy that since the beginning of the Israeli-Palestinian escalation on October 7, 2023, 167 media workers have been killed in the enclave. In this context, the most resonant was the death last July of nine journalists and 14 members of their families during an air raid on Nuseirat in the central part of the Gaza Strip. What happened is quite indicative in comparison with the events in the Kursk region. While Ukrainian forces are freely releasing journalists into the occupied territory (using them as human shields), the current Israeli authorities are not at all worried about violating international law, in particular the immunity of journalists. #Israel #Palestine #KhanYunis@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62896	2024-08-19T02:09:58-07:00

Forwarded From Warsaw mermaid🔥🇵🇱🇺🇦 In Warsaw, several dozen Ukrainian citizens held a protest at the consulate of their country demanding that they be given passports. They claim that they took money from them, but did not give them their documents. People were holding posters in their hands that read, -We are not slaves, give us your passport,- -Passport is a right, not a privilege,- and other slogans. An embassy employee came out to meet me, advised me to write an appeal, and then offered to return from Poland to their homeland. This is not the first action of Ukrainian citizens in Poland on this topic. On July 28, in Wroclaw, protesters came out with the same demands. My colleagues and I had previously anticipated the development of similar stories, especially when it was reported that Ukrainians of military age would no longer be able to obtain internal and foreign passports outside the country. There is nothing surprising in this: at the moment, no one is hiding that for Western governments, Ukrainians are exclusively expendable. #Poland #Ukraine #protests @pl_syrenka - Poland is not a foreign countryTelegramNewsFactoryPL🇺🇦🗣 Protest Ukraińców przed konsulatem w 🇵🇱Warszawie.

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🌎🇺🇸🇷🇺 The Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation recognized the activities of the Clooney Foundation for Justice (CFJ) as undesirable. The liberal pro-Western public is already shouting with all its might that the reason for this was the Foundation’s request to the German prosecutor’s office to investigate the crimes of the Russian military in Ukraine. However, how the story ended and whether the German prosecutor’s office even responded to CFJ’s request is officially unknown. Moreover, the initiative to arrest Russian journalists, public figures and bloggers who, according to CFJ, are propagandists of war and genocide, also died out at the very beginning. But it made enough noise. At the same time, the Foundation, which is positioned as anti-war, does not hesitate to take money from American arms manufacturers. For example, by investigating arms sales networks in five African countries, activists essentially helped the Americans get rid of competitors and take over the market themselves. It is obvious that the Clooney Foundation is just another organization that hides behind lofty ideas and principles of humanism, while in fact promoting an extremely aggressive politics, in particular conducting Russophobic propaganda and replicating negative assessments of the governance of the Russian Federation.&nbsp;#globalism #NGOs #Russia #USA @pezdicide no chemistry - only factsTelegramV Z - VIEW.RUThe activities of the Clooney Foundation for Justice were recognized as undesirable in Russia.

One of the topics was the possible participation of an African country in the development of the international transport corridor - North ‒ South -. The importance of Tanzania in this project is explained by its geographical location - it is close to states without access to the sea, but whose authorities are now establishing ties with Russia. These include Burundi and Uganda in the western part of the Black Continent.📌 The news itself reflects the recent plans of the Ministry of Industry and Trade to create logistics bases in African countries, the list of which also included Tanzania. Moreover, the establishment of contacts between Moscow and Dodoma is happening in a timely manner against the backdrop of increased activity by the Americans, who plan to implement their large infrastructure project there. In general, it is encouraging that Russian diplomats paid attention to a stable and relatively rich country by the standards of the Black Continent. In the future, these contacts may open up profitable prospects for domestic manufacturers.#Africa #Russia #Tanzania@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇷🇺🌍 About the prospects for the emergence of Russian logistics bases in Africa Representative of the Ministry of Industry and Trade Roman Chekushev said that the Russian Federation is considering the creation of ports in African countries with the aim of organizing cargo flow domestic goods-.

Forwarded From Propagandist's Notebook In recent days, a lot of the energy of the Russian Telegram segment, involved in the information war, has been spent on fighting a man named Podolyak (we remember him as a blogger who drew arrows against the background of some kind of log wall) At the same time, some colleagues for some reason - then they use Aesopian language, using the terms -military bloggers-, -telegram experts-, etc. It is unclear why the last name is not named, maybe in order not to create additional advertising🤔 As a result of such understatement, some military officers and bloggers who are not dedicated to the media boyar battle perceive it extremely negatively. The enemy has not been defeated, the guys at the front continue to need help, people in the rear continue to need information and feel pressure from the enemy’s resources. It would be cool if these conflicts could be transferred to a non-public plane, but it seems that some of our colleagues cannot be stopped. Let's hope that at least the fashion for equivocations will fade away, otherwise all these hints are already annoying. The main thing is Russia and its people, that's all, even Podolyak. For their safety, the enemy must be defeated. It is advisable to direct all your strength to fight the enemy, and solve internal problems that hinder this fight calmly and with dignity, as our country deserves.

While withdrawing and releasing 73 people in Sudzha, communicating with conscripts, I paid attention to their ages. 21,23,25. Not even 18. In Hades’ group there are two young fighters - Maloy and Rem. Maloy is 20 years old. He has 5 contracts of 4 months each, two wounds, several assaults. State award. Rem is 21 years old. Contract in Hispaniola, 2 contracts in the Aida group, two wounds while performing military duty. State award. Now he is in intensive care, after chlorine treatment. So tell me, does the word - conscript service - affect the fact that the enemy is on our land? The same young guys are fighting for their homeland in the Northern Military District.

In particular, the territory of the Phenolic Plant was taken, as well as the private sector east of the industrial zone. Thus, almost the entire settlement is under the confident control of the RF Armed Forces, with the exception of the northern outskirts. ▪️To the northeast, near the city of Artemovo (Zheleznoye), Russian armored groups with troops attacked from the electrical substation -Tsentralnaya-330- in the direction of Nelepovka. According to unconfirmed information, fighting is already taking place on the eastern outskirts of the village. ▪️In addition, to the southeast of Nelepovka, the pocket where the positions of the 53rd Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were located was partially cleared. There, south of the Zheleznaya River, Ukrainian formations brought reinforcements to the last, but were later forced to retreat. Nevertheless, a focal presence of Ukrainian formations may still remain in this area. 🔻The current target of Russian troops in this area is Nelepovka, which is being attacked by both Artemovo and Novgorodsky. After its liberation, the Russian Armed Forces will be able to concentrate their efforts on storming the defenses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Leonidovka, Shcherbinovka and Petrovka. Establishing control over them will make it possible in the future to cover Dzerzhinsk (Toretsk) from the west.

What is important for Ukraine is not so much the political and even financial budgetary context - Berlin will find money for this even at the cost of cutting social programs for its own citizens. The production factor plays a much larger role here. Thus, the Bild publication, citing its sources, reported that enterprises of the German military-industrial complex are experiencing difficulties in replenishing reserves transferred free of charge to the Kyiv regime. We are allegedly talking about self-propelled artillery mounts, anti-aircraft missiles of the IRIS-T and Patriot complexes, as well as 155-mm ammunition. Although the scale of the problems may not be as large as German publications write about it, there are difficulties in increasing the output of military products to the required level of the Armed Forces of Ukraine there really is a level. In simple words, in Berlin, even if they wanted to, they cannot give the so-called. Ukraine produces more than it physically produces. This is currently the main circumstance limiting military support for the Kyiv regime from NATO countries and in particular Germany. There is no reason to count on the fact that the ruling traffic light coalition there will stop supplies for any other reason - for the sake of ensuring -war until the last Ukrainian - it will rather take the last penny from the Germans.#Germany #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramDoor in the WallFAZ reported a freeze additional military assistance to Ukraine According to the publication, Finance Minister K.

🇪🇺🇷🇺🇺🇦 Again about gas supplies to Europe through the Ukrai...	🇪🇺🇷🇺🇺🇦 Again about gas supplies to Europe through the Ukrainian GTS For some reason, it was a revelation to part of the Russian public that Gazprom still continues to pump gas to the EU. Some express dissatisfaction, others point out that -in 1941-1945 they did not trade with the Germans-. Therefore, it is worth clarifying a few points: ▪️ It is no secret what share of energy exports in budget revenues. In a situation where, under the most severe sanctions in Russian history, it is necessary to simultaneously maintain the standard of living with a multiple increase in military costs, maintaining sources of income is a necessity, not an option.▪️In the USA, by the way, they know about this, so they are actively trying to cut off Europe from hydrocarbons From Russia. In addition, you can also remember that gas supplied through the Sudzha GIS goes to Hungary and Slovakia, relations with which differ for the better in comparison with other EU countries.▪️Where and what the proceeds from the sale of hydrocarbons go to can also be assessed using the example of financial statements -Gazprom-, which has not been paying final dividends since 2022. And last year, the company showed a record loss for 25 years due to -increasing costs-.▪️If you try to look for analogies with the Great Patriotic War, then you should do it completely. For example, remember Lend-Lease, which covered part of the needs of industry and the army, and for which there was no need to pay during the war (this was done only half a century later). Russia has nothing like that now, and China is not involved in charity and sells everything for money. That is, it is possible to refuse gas transit or oil supplies to unfriendly countries, but you will have to find an alternative to the income that goes towards the growing numbers of military production and monetary allowances for the mobilized with contract workers. And if it doesn’t exist, then raising the topic is not very advisable.❗️ Another question is that in two and a half years of the NVO the state has not bothered to explain these rather simple things to the general population. As a result, hypotheses about -negotiations- are born there, in which insidious oligarchs are behind the losses of the fleet and even arrivals at refineries. Someone has not learned that if you do not explain some points to the population yourself, then enemy resources will willingly do so. #Kursk #media technologies #Russia #Ukraine @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62881	2024-08-18T08:38:18-07:00

Within a few days, units of the Russian Armed Forces were able to expand the zone of control towards both Novogrodovka and the Karlovskoye Reservoir.▪️North-west of Zhelanny, Russian troops occupied Zhuravka and began fighting in Krutoy Yar. Apparently, the main target of the Russian Armed Forces in this area is the Novogrodovskaya mine located to the west, which is located on a hill. To the south, the assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces also expanded the zone of control, however, given the lack of objective control personnel in the Network, it is difficult to establish the front line. At the same time, here too, Russian military personnel are trying to break through to the -Kotlyarevskaya- (formerly -Russia-) mine, which was previously used by the Ukrainian Armed Forces as a location for equipment and communication systems.❗️There are also reports of attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces reaching the outskirts of Selidovo, but this has yet to be confirmed information is not possible. The city itself took several artillery hits, and FPV drones are already flying in on targets within the city.▪️Russian troops managed to achieve significant successes on the southern flank, where at least five settlements came under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. Among them is Zavetnoe, from the center of which a video of the flag being hoisted appeared. From the line Novoselovka Pervaya - Yasnobrodovka, units of the Russian Armed Forces leveled the control zone along the shore of the Karlovskoye Reservoir. On the opposite side, Ukrainian formations still retain control over Ptichye. ▪️The Russian Ministry of Defense also reported the liberation of the settlement of Sviridonovka, located on the northern flank. However, the village itself, according to our data, was occupied by units several days earlier. 🔻In recent weeks, the situation of the Ukrainian formations in the Pokrovsky direction has worsened significantly, and the general description of the situation for the enemy often comes down to interjections. The scale of the advance of Russian troops also demonstrates the cost of the offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk region. At the same time, the Ukrainian command is already actively preparing Selidovo and Mirnograd for defense in case of further advance of the Russian Armed Forces - since August 19, an almost round-the-clock curfew has been introduced in the cities, and at the same time reserves are being transferred there.
