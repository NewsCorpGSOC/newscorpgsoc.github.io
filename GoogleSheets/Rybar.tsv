Forwarded From Hard Blog Russian telegram channels enthusiastically publish the theory that the Nord Streams were blown up by Ukraine. Although all this just indicates that this stuffing is a disastrous cover operation. Ukraine is an ideal candidate. It's like assigning another sexual encounter to an old port prostitute. And she will not deny it, since this will not affect her reputation in any way, and no one will have any special doubts. The CIA initially floated several theories, including the involvement of Russia itself. It scattered attention and demonstrated that many people had a motive. But they didn’t particularly oppose the version with the involvement of the United States - this was also beneficial. So that everyone understands how you can act decisively, but no one can prove anything. Well, everyone understood who could have the audacity to carry out such an operation in the exclusive economic zones of two European member countries of the NATO bloc. crests would never do this. Even if they had such a plan, they would have implemented it in Russian territorial waters or at least on their border. A possible change of power in the United States required them to appoint a culprit in order to avoid unnecessary risks. This is the only reason why Ukraine is now being blamed and all Western media will now push this version. But why should we seriously discuss such nonsense? Even if this group of divers was present there in some way, they were used in the dark precisely in order to point a finger at them in case of risks. They fed them well and took the bait perfectly. This is a real information war, and not the sad trolling on the Internet by hackers, which some are trying to pass off as an information war.	https://t.me/rybar/62791	2024-08-14T23:33:14-07:00

Forwarded From Warsaw mermaid🇵🇱🇧🇾 An interesting thing: as soon as unofficial information spread that Warsaw was planning some kind of provocation against Belarus, the Poles decided to make an unequivocal refutation. According to Polish Interior Minister Tomasz Siemoniak, the latest actions of the Belarusian authorities have created favorable conditions for resolving the crisis between the two countries, including the possibility of opening closed Polish border checkpoints. However, what exactly the Belarusian authorities did in order to gain the favor of the Poles is kept secret. Sources say that there have been absolutely no changes in relations with Minsk, so most likely this statement is an internal political move by the ruling coalition, designed for the domestic electorate. 📌It is quite obvious that despite such statements by the Polish authorities, the Armed Forces of Ukraine can still commit a provocation against the Belarusian border. At the same time, the participation of the Polish side in such events was initially unlikely. In addition, from a domestic political point of view, tightening relations with Belarus now will not help the sinking cabinet of Donald Tusk. But it’s still worth remembering that if the Poles act, it will be on the sly, in order to further annoy the enemy and at the same time, according to tradition, to get into trouble themselves. #Belarus #Ukraine #Poland@pl_syrenka - Poland is not a foreign countryTelegramWarsaw mermaid🇵🇱🇺🇦🇧🇾 Analysts say Poland and Ukraine, which concluded a long-debated comprehensive security pact in early June, appear to be coordinating a new campaign of military pressure on Belarus.

Forwarded From Sex, cartels, Frida Kahlo🇬🇧On the topic of law, order and freedom of speech against the backdrop of protests in the English segment, there was simply amazing content. From the headline - Britain needs no lessons from riot apologists - to the talking points - Law and order repression is widely underestimated as a public policy response. It turns out that more than a thousand arrests (including teenagers aged 12 and 13) and several quick and harsh sentences (including for posts on social networks) are the correct answers, and this should certainly be followed by additional resources for the police and prisons and intelligence - so that no one thinks that they can rebel without consequences. The historical mission of mainstream politics is also proclaimed - to listen to real communities, and not to their -evil mouthpieces-. In addition, they simply made fun of those right-wing politicians who supposedly believe that anyone who shouted -Allahu akbar- can be arrested (at the same time, imprisonment for publishing an announcement about a gathering for a protest, kicking a bus or depicting a hooting monkey is the new norm) . #Great Britain #crime@sex_drugs_kahlo - Latin American happiness [no]TelegramOld Lady England🇬🇧The youngest defendants in the case of unrest in the UK were two 12-year-old boys.

Russian troops launched another series of attacks on targets in the territory controlled by the Kyiv regime in Zhitomir, Vinnitsa, Nikolaev, Kyiv and other regions. In the evening there was an explosion in the port of Odessa. Ukrainian formations carried out one of the most massive launches of drones across Russian territory since the beginning of the Northern Military District. The targets were the military airfields of Baltimore and Borisoglebsk in the Voronezh region, as well as Savasleika in the Nizhny Novgorod region. In the Kursk direction, footage appeared indicating the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the village of Vnezapnoye in the Korenevsky district. In the Sudzhansky district, the front line did not undergo significant changes. In the Slobozhansky direction, Russian troops repelled another enemy attack in the Kolotilovka international checkpoint area, and were also able to significantly expand the zone of control east of the village of Lukyantsy. In the Alexander-Kalinovsky direction, a cauldron is gradually being formed east of Novgorod (New York). At the same time, fighting does not subside in Druzhba, Kirovo and Artemovo, where the Russian Armed Forces are also advancing in battle. 🔻A detailed analytical report on events in the Special Military Operation zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_bot High-resolution maps: Situation in the Special Military Operation zone (ru; en) Russian borderland (ru; en) #Artemovsk #Belgorod #Voronezh #digest #report #Kursk #map #Pokrovsk #Russia #Ukraine #Ugledar @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62784	2024-08-14T13:03:05-07:00

The enemy is not giving up attempts to advance deeper into the Kursk region and is transferring forces to gain a foothold in the occupied territories. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, footage appeared with members of Ukrainian formations in the center of the village of Vnezapnoye, although information about the enemy’s presence there appeared yesterday. Given the location of the village on the western bank of the Blyakhovets River, the Ukrainian Armed Forces may also be present in the village of Gordeevka, while the status of Viktorovka and Uspenivka remains in question. However, there were still no reports of fighting in Byakhovo. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, the situation still remains tense and hidden - the fog of war -. Ukrainian media continue to publish stories about -control- over Sudzha, posting footage from the western outskirts and the center. 🔻In the Belovsky district during the day, information appeared about high enemy activity, but there was no confirmation of this. Also late in the evening, the acting governor of the region announced the mandatory evacuation of the village of Glushkovo.

The Israelis let them in front of them into potentially mined tunnels and buildings as -anthropomorphic mine sweeps-. The IDF mainly used Palestinians accused of having links with militants, but sometimes also involved ordinary civilians, including the elderly and teenagers. They were dressed in Israeli military uniforms in order to lure out Hamas fire, and they were also fitted with body cameras for remote surveillance. According to journalists, the IDF command, right down to the Chief of the General Staff, was well aware of this practice and saw nothing wrong with it. At the same time, captured Palestinians were promised release from custody for carrying out such missions. 📌 Needless to say, such methods are prohibited by all possible conventions. However, over the past year, the ruling Israeli authorities have publicly demonstrated their contempt for them more than once, and the collective West and international organizations have traditionally been in no hurry to introduce any real sanctions against Israel. Well, it’s no longer surprising that such an attitude towards the residents of the Gaza Strip on the part of the IDF has to - this fully fits into the policy of the current ultra-Orthodox Israeli government, whose members previously directly called the Palestinians -animals-.#Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport usThe Times of IsraelReport: IDF using Gazans to check areas that may be booby-trapped before troops enterSoldiers tell Israeli newspaper that commanders send Palestinian civilians into tunnels and buildings they fear are rigged, claim chief of staff and top brass aware of practice	https://t.me/rybar/62781	2024-08-14T09:44:32-07:00
🔁🖼 ⚡️NATO is trying to increase the number of units for the war...	Forwarded From Two Majors ⚡️NATO is trying to increase the staffing of units for the war with Russia. According to Reuters, the Alliance countries are looking for urgent ways to additionally recruit into the ranks of the armed forces. 🇨🇿In the Czech Republic, on the basis of the 4th Rapid Deployment Brigade (headquarters in Žatec, 50% staffing), a military training program for 80 high school students has been launched. In addition, from September 1, 2024, the Czech Ministry of Defense is reducing the medical requirements for military personnel, reservists and recruits. In 🇵🇱 Poland, from whose armed forces 9 thousand contract soldiers left in 2023, a conscription campaign has been launched - Vacations with the army -, which involves basic military training of citizens aged 18 to 35 years within 28 days.🇭🇺The Hungarian Armed Forces took the path of popularizing the service and launched a media campaign, visual street advertising and the creation of a military series. 🇷🇴In Romania, the government announced recruitment for military service after 43% of officer and 23% of soldier positions remained vacant. The shortage has left two Patriot air defense batteries completely short-staffed, as well as pilots for the newly purchased F-16 aircraft. Romanians are considering taking emergency measures to increase wages and expand social benefits. Earlier, in July 2024, Reuters reported ⚡️NATO plans to form from 35 to 50 additional brigades (each from 3 to 7 thousand troops) to implement its new plans in terms of attack - defense against attack from Russia -.✨ Well, while NATO is trying to push its citizens into the army, the war is being waged by the hands of Ukraine. In this way, cheap Ukrainian slaves are used, and the Alliance gains time to prepare an attack and wears down the combat potential of the future enemy. ✨⭐️Such articles in Western countries, first of all, are aimed at obtaining additional budgets for military spending. But no one can cancel the obvious fact of NATO’s preparation for war with Russia. Two majors	https://t.me/rybar/62780	2024-08-14T09:21:56-07:00
