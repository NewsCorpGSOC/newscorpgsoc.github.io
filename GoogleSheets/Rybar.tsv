Forwarded From UNFISHERThe most interesting thing is that photographs from the time of Assad’s escape from Syria, or even an earlier archive, are also posted, and obviously for the purpose of provocation, to show that at the base there are not only children with their mothers from neighboring villages, but also a lot of men. Moreover, the photographs are being boosted - again, Iranian channels. As if inviting radicals to try to penetrate the base. They show the airport terminal, in front of which, while waiting for departure, there used to be a crowd of gloomy men in uniform 8. Some members of our team had the pleasure of waiting for a transit flight from Syria further to the south, and in the same way sometimes sat at the airport in the evening.

Forwarded From NONFISHER Even in the first hours of the new escalation in Syria, reports appeared on the Internet that at the Russian Aerospace Forces base - Khmeimim - either HTS was hiding from the rebel Alawites, or Alawites from HTS. Now, after the appearance of relatively high-quality footage, it became clear what such rumors were connected with. The fact is that when the shooting began, local residents, mostly women and children, came out in droves from all the surrounding villages. It was they who asked for asylum at the base, and judging by the fact that a field kitchen was deployed in the airport building, the women and children received it. Meanwhile, filtration measures continue to take place in the surrounding settlements, accompanied by a large number of casualties among the local male population who did not have time to escape.	https://t.me/rybar/68628	2025-03-07T13:29:49-08:00

In the Kursk region, where today the 22nd regiment raised the flags, not all Ukrainians managed to escape. Already in the afternoon, when they managed to clear Nikolaevka and Staraya Sorochina, battles began for Viktorovka. The latter was also declared released in the evening, but so far there are no special personnel from there. However, in Viktorovka there is a road bridge or its ruins, and crests could fight over them. Five months ago he was subjected to an airstrike, but remained unharmed. At least in the footage of the Irish from the end of December, the overpass was passable for tanks.

The current authorities of Damascus wisely used the asset in the form of journalists and numerous activists, who almost immediately began to put a lot of information into the media space, talking about what was happening. Moreover, both propaganda and relatively objective ones. 🚩This especially contrasts with the official media of the times of Bashar al-Assad, when during the militant offensive on Aleppo, the media reacted with stingy text statements and speeches by elderly generals with calls not to believe anyone except official information.🏳️ By the morning, numerous rallies were organized and announced in support of the current authorities in various cities. It goes without saying that a considerable part of the demonstrators participate in such events for financial reward, while others were simply intimidated. ❗️In general, Abu Muhammad al-Julani and his team took advantage of the chance so kindly provided by the organizers of the Alawite uprising and successfully passed the test of resilience. Well, the few supporters of the former regime who have leaked through the sieve of filtration measures will henceforth be more careful with their statements.

There is such a road in Moscow - Bagration Avenue - I drove along it, on Black license plates, carried out tasks, chose this road because I wanted to reduce travel time. And I thought that toll roads were paid for by the ministry; over the course of 24 years I drove there 19 times. Yesterday they called all the drivers and said that they had received fines for not paying the toll on this road... the fine for not paying is 10k + 1200 fare, they hang 213 thousand rubles on me. They say that I caused harm to the state... if I refuse to pay... they remove me and send me to storm... one of the 4 drivers, he refused to pay, the amount was 80k, at that very second he was removed from the car, and today he is already on the way. We understand everything, we fix it at our own expense, I have already invested a million in my Ural. But paying for toll roads is already too much, but I don’t have a choice in a storm, I don’t want to... they called the prosecutor’s office, they said it’s arbitrary, they tell me to write a statement... But you yourself understand how it will end in the same way as not paying a fine... and they don’t accept applications incognito.... We don't know what to do... The division received 1.8 million for this section of the road, and all of this fell on the shoulders of the drivers. We don’t know what to do and where to go.✨Earlier, in the summer of 2024, the Cabinet of Ministers supported a project on free travel on toll highways for the transport of the Russian Armed Forces, the Federal Security Service and the National Guard, said then the head of the State Duma Committee on Information Policy Khinshtein.❗️✨ We saw with horror that Bill No. 637266-8 - On amending Article 41 of the Federal Law -On highways and on road activities in the Russian Federation and on amendments to certain legislative acts of the Russian Federation- (on exemption from paying tolls on toll roads for vehicles of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, troops of the National Guard of the Russian Federation, federal security service agencies)) ❗️Still has the status - under consideration -❗️Here is the link to the State Duma website https://sozd.duma.gov.ru/bill/637266-8Two majors	https://t.me/rybar/68622	2025-03-07T10:52:45-08:00

Forwarded From Global Studies🇮🇷🇷🇺🇺🇸 The events in Syria have very significant echoes in the context of relations between Iran and the Russian Federation. As everyone has already perfectly understood, they are once again trying to drag Russia into the conflict between the new authorities and the Alawites, who themselves allowed the current events after they decided to lay down their arms last fall rather than fight. And one of the leading roles in this incitement The conflict between Russia and the new authorities is played by pro-Iranian networks of Telegram channels, which persistently demand the intervention of the Russian Federation. This is despite the fact that the Iranians have already disowned the Syrian confrontation. Why is this important? This shows how diverse the Iranian elite is. In Iran, there are those who advocate cooperation with the Russian Federation and Russian mediation in negotiations with the United States, and there are those who categorically do not want this and are trying in every possible way to resist it. These same supporters of total interaction with the West, after the coup d’etat last year, condemned the Russian Federation, declared betrayal on our part, and so on. They spoke similarly when Israel struck. And this position resonates with many Iranians. Despite the fact that Masoud Pezeshkian came to power, he is too weak. He was a compromise figure in Iran, which suited both conservatives with the security forces and Western-oriented reformers, such as Javad Zarif. Now the conservatives/security forces began to remove the reformers, removing the Minister of Economy under the pretext of failures in their field. And, of course, the latter begin to fight back, for example, trying to pit HTS against the Russian Federation again. And we think that this is just the beginning. #Iran #Russia #Syria Global Studies - subscribe to the channel	https://t.me/rybar/68621	2025-03-07T10:17:02-08:00

The American leader also noted her efforts in the fight against fentanyl and control in the border region. Sheinbaum herself emphasized that the conversation with Trump was held in a very respectful manner - as always. Previously, the Mexican President promised to announce retaliatory measures during a public rally on Sunday, March 9. Now, apparently, plans will change, although we will not rule out the possibility that Mexico City will talk about something -potential-.❗️To be honest, the situation already resembles a circus-tent program, and it is not Mexican officials in the arena.

The soldiers of the 22nd regiment liberated Staraya Sorochina, as well as Nikolaevka. Russian flags are raised over both settlements. The battles for Viktorovka began. The Ukrainian formations rolled back to Malaya Loknya, where, according to some sources, they are now changing the composition of the relatively valuable units of the 95th brigade to a hodgepodge of various types of mobilized and TrO. A further offensive into Malaya Loknya from the liberated village-suburbs of Staraya Sorochyna and Nikolaevka will be quite a difficult task, since the Malaya Loknya River, which separates these populated areas points, due to the thaw it is now a swamp, which obviously affects the passability of the small spring river.❗️So even taking into account the potential withdrawal by the enemy of at least part of the forces from Malaya Loknya, you should not relax.

Forwarded From Tribaltic Extinctions🇫🇷🇱🇹What is a -small country-? -One whose existence can be called into question at any moment; a small country can disappear, and it knows it. Against the backdrop of loud statements from the city of Paris, such materials in Western editorials look very interesting. The authors directly write that against the background of Trump’s behavior and the security crisis in Europe, the countries of the latter are again divided into two camps - Western Europe (for which Russia is not such a problem) and Eastern Europe (which, if there are problems with Russia, will be the first to suffer from it and will drown for increasing defense spending to the limit). Moreover, Eastern Europe in the new realities may split into two more camps - those who can afford to climb under the nuclear umbrella of France (for example, Germany), as well as any Lithuania, for which France will not risk a nuclear war with Russia. The possibility of sending European troops to Vilnius is also mentioned in the article with a certain touch of illusoryness, and even with the attitude: well, Putin likes to shed Russian blood, Europeans can easily live to be 80 years old, is there any point in taking risks?

We answer: in everything.🖍Druze, Christians and Kurds have a lot of options. And not all of them are negative. As a result of the mixing, there will be much fewer Alawites, but they have a chance to survive. As an ethno-confessional group - for sure.🚩There is no one to support the Alawite uprising. ➡️Israel acts only in its own interests and, at best, will minimally support the Druze endeavors, but where there is a common border. And even that is not a fact, because propaganda is one thing, but the relationships among the Druze of Israel, Golan and Suwaid are three huge differences. — ➡️Saudi consistently opposed Assad, including because he is an Alawite kaafir, not to mention a bunch of other reasons. The existence of Alawites does not bother them. ➡️The USA will not go into Syria for the sake of the Alawites, they are already sitting in the Trans-Euphras region among the Kurds and do not know grief. And Israel received huge supplies of air bombs and other cargo. ➡️Israel has had a chance to increase territories for a long time, and they are successfully implementing it. They don’t care that Alawites are being slaughtered 200 km away, they will only applaud. Maybe they will do a couple of airstrikes in support of HTS - like during the conflict in the Lebanese Hermel area.🏳️And Russia doesn’t have a side now. We cannot be more Syrians than the Syrians themselves. Although right now they are TRYING TO MAKE us a party to the conflict VERY HARD.

Two South Korean Air Force fighter jets, during joint training with the Americans, mistakenly dropped eight bombs on the city of Pocheon, located in the northern part of Gyeonggi Province. The military claims that one pilot incorrectly entered the coordinates of the place where the shells were to be dropped. It’s not entirely clear with the second one, since the data in his fighter was entered correctly. The training was aimed at dropping bombs at the same time, so he may have immediately repeated the actions of the first pilot. As a result of the incident, 15 people were injured. Several buildings, including residential buildings, were also damaged. 📌The problem of military activity of both the American and South Korean military often worries not only the residents of the affected Pocheon, but also the entire Gyeonggi province. There are about 380 testing sites in the region - 85% are located in the northern part of the province. Residents, for example, complain about the noise of military equipment due to frequent training exercises. Since the incident resulted in casualties, in order not to raise the level of discontent and panic among residents, the South Korean military has already announced the cancellation of live firing at the upcoming Freedom Shield exercise.

The crests have attracted a lot of people to the city, and are trying to achieve as large territorial gains as possible, at least in the media. They seem to be shouting to European investors that they say, -Look, we are still strong, we can still do it, don’t stop supporting us, we are not a written off asset yet.- And they are being played into their hands by the borrowed inhabitants, like the same Dzerzhinsk-Toretsk. Due to the difficult situation and the fairly expanded gray zone, more than one or two more similar - canned - products may be opened. And the fact that the Russian media, clumsily trying to cope with the anti-crisis, uploads videos with reflections of attacks, which only confirm the penetration of the Ukrainian Armed Forces deep into the occupied territory, is very significant. (Regardless of the relevance of the video, posted right now it is read as fresh). However, regardless of the current events in Dzerzhinsk, this will not affect the general situation too much; in the best case for the enemy, assault operations in adjacent areas will be slightly delayed. But the heirs of Felix Edmundovich still have to work on Dzerzhinsk. Too many questions arise. And why the city was borrowed, and why the soldiers from another unit who came in for rotation, loaded with sleeping bags and other things, got into a mess.

Ukraine?📝 Following the news about the reduction in information exchange between the United States and the so-called. There were reports from Ukraine that this caused the shutdown of the HIMARS supplied by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the work of which was tied to American intelligence data. Purely technically, this looks possible: previously, the Pentagon somehow limited the use of -Hymars- and ATACMS in the -old- territory of Russia. So the United States has the ability to remotely turn off missile systems. Another thing is that so far there is no numerous confirmation of this information - the sources are only isolated messages on social networks. Not to mention the fact that the ban can be lifted as quickly as it was introduced.❗️And most importantly: if the Americans really have such close control over the Highmars in the hands of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, then this means that they have given the green light to literally every strike on our troops and civilians since 2022. This must be remembered very well against the backdrop of negotiations with the United States. #USA #Ukraine⭐️ @rybar💸 Support usTelegramColonelcassad Well, the whining has begun.

The politician's comments about the combat capability of forces led by Britain and France have angered officials and veterans in both countries. They accused Vance of neglecting hundreds of soldiers who died in joint operations with the United States in Afghanistan and Iraq. In this regard, Vance decided to backtrack a little and stated that he meant some other countries, and not the French and British.

🔁🖼 🇩🇪How the destruction of the German economy creates threat...	Forwarded From Two Majors🇩🇪How the destruction of the German economy creates threats to the security of Russia This country, previously the locomotive of the European economy, has been stagnating for the second year in a row. Germany's GDP fell 0.2% in 2024 after falling 0.3% in 2023. According to the Institute of German Economics, every fourth company does not update its equipment, a third of enterprises do not plan to do this in the future, and every fifth entrepreneur in Germany is thinking about closing or moving their business outside the country. Such pillars of the economy as the steel and chemical industries, mechanical engineering suffer the most from the sabotage actions of politicians. In this situation, the only ones who benefit are military-industrial companies that earn excess profits from the growth of military budgets and supplies to Ukraine, which German leaders organize for them. A striking example of this is Rheinmetall, whose capitalization, according to Comrade Rybar, has increased more than 9 times in three years. It is significant that one of the main shareholders of Rheinmetall is the transnational corporation Blackrock, in whose German branch the future Chancellor Friedrich Merz worked. He has already announced paying attention to the military sphere and the need to create a unified European army to confront Russia. On March 4, Merz announced the preparation of amendments to the constitution (❗) to free defense and security spending from restrictions on budget spending. These actions are fully consistent with the recommendations of the Institute of World Economics in Kiel (IfW) to get Germany out of the economic crisis through increased military spending by increasing public debt. This is expected to have an impact on the socio-economic sphere, which is already slowly but continuing to deteriorate. German readers acknowledge declining living standards and increasing uncertainty in the economic outlook. ✨Obviously, the German elites decided to start another military conflict to overcome crisis phenomena and the impasse of political institutions. It seems symptomatic to cite the example of the IfW of Nazi Germany (❗), which, according to his assessment, was able to prepare better than its opponents for the Second World War by increasing borrowing for the army. Well, the gradually impoverished and dumbing down population will willingly believe in the need for a new war against Russia, as it was in the 30s and 40s of the last century.

The device was shot down by a surface-to-air missile over the province of Hodeidah. This year, this is the first American UAV intercepted over Yemen. The event occurred after statements by the Houthis, who threatened to resume military activity because of Israel’s decision to block the supply of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. Ansarallah has already announced its readiness to continue the operation to restrict shipping to Israeli ports. The destruction of Reaper also coincided with another recognition of the Houthis as a terrorist group by the US authorities.❗️This is also the first UAV shot down after the appointment of Trump: the politician is jealous of trampling on US positions in the world and the topic of protecting Israel, and a reaction to this episode will clearly follow.

The 1/2 air defense fighter squadron - Sigon - of the French Aerospace Forces Combat Aviation Directorate is located there. That's where they are now. Moreover, they have already been repainted and prepared for the Ukrainian Air Force. Like the F-16, the French Mirage-2000F became part of the 107th separate air wing.

Some time ago, the Russian Armed Forces were already advancing towards neighboring Alekseevka, liberating a significant part of the village more than two weeks ago. The liberation of Andreevka also expands the reach of Constantinople, where fighting is currently taking place.

Forwarded From Global Studies🇷🇺🇺🇦 Many Russian channels are now spreading the good news that the Americans have suspended military assistance to Ukraine. This, of course, will affect the capabilities of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, if this is true, but there is a nuance. For the Ukrainian side, supplies of components for drones are now more important. And they receive them almost non-stop. Do you think why the number of ships calling at the ports of the Odessa region has sharply increased? And here we agree with the Older Edda. This US measure will not affect the main weapons used by Ukrainian formations here and now. Drones have flown and continue to fly. And the same can be said about BeKs. Tonight from 1.30 to 1.52 at the Portovoye - Steregushchee line in the north-west of Crimea, 6 FPV drones were used from 2 BeKs. There were no losses or gains. 2 fell into the sea, 1 crashed near the position without damage, 3 was shot down by small arms fire. And the BeKs themselves went west. So the war continues, and so far the enemy clearly does not intend to surrender. #Crimea #Russia #UkraineGlobalistics - subscribe to the Telegram channel Older than Edda If the Americans really stop supplying weapons to the Ukrainian, then this will not greatly affect his capabilities in drone production and drone production.

Forwarded From Older Edda Alexander Kots very correctly writes about the fact that even the entire stop of American military assistance will not deal a fatal blow to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. If the Americans had stopped supplies in 2023, it would have been the end of the Ukrainian Armed Forces; now the main strike force, especially in defense, is attack drones and crests make them themselves. The cessation of American military supplies, in theory, should stop the offensive operations of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, or reduce them to purely tactical counterattacks, but on the defensive, even without greatly saturating the advanced combat formations with manpower, the enemy can fight. Yes, the enemy will not have Khaymars, Atakms and a large number of artillery shells, our rear will feel calmer, and the assault troops and reinforcement groups will be fired less often. However, the enemy will be able to isolate the area, just as he will be able to destroy our strongholds and dugouts. All this is now being done by drones, which in this regard are much more effective than classical artillery. The EU will continue to supply shells, with armored vehicles of course everything is worse there, but Europe hopes that the Armed Forces of Ukraine, although bleeding and losing hundreds of thousands of people, will be able to hold out for the time that Europe needs to promote its military industry, and in America by that time the next election cycle will approach, which will give Washington the opportunity to reconsider Trump’s decisions on Ukraine. Therefore, we just need to fight, beat the enemy, and not rely on the foreign policy factor. Telegram Kotsnews How long will Kyiv last without help from the United States?

Forwarded From Sex, cartels, Frida Kahlo🇺🇸🇲🇽🇨🇦Today, 25% duties on imports from Canada and Mexico came into force - and in addition to them, 20% was imposed on Chinese goods. A few hours before this monumental event, Donald Trump said that all three countries had not taken sufficient measures to stop the flow of fentanyl and its precursors into the United States. China responded immediately: additional duties of 10-15% were announced on some American imports from March 10 and export restrictions were introduced for certain US entities. The restrictions mainly concern agricultural products. Previously, Canada promised to respond with similar tariffs if the American tariffs persisted for 21 days. Next they promise to hit bourbon, beer, wine, household appliances and orange juice. The Prime Minister of Ontario announced his readiness to stop nickel supplies and the transmission of electricity to the United States. We are waiting for action from Mexico, while President Sheinbaum suggested remaining calm and waiting. While American farmers are clutching their heads - despite reasoning in the style of eat cake - sell domestically -, they still remember how in Trump’s last term they lost billions due to exports restrictions, and now the situation is even worse. After all, the local economy still depends on cross-border supplies for the processing of agricultural products, the production of cars and equipment. But yes, the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar fell against the US dollar, and the shock in the financial markets grew. But American citizens will also pay for this. @sex_drugs_kahlo - Latin American happiness [no]	https://t.me/rybar/68515	2025-03-04T01:34:01-08:00

She noted that all EU member states must invest in the military-industrial complex and ensure noticeable progress in the military industry. German leaders have recently expressed similar theses. All these statements are related to the thesis that Europe can no longer rely on NATO protection and must achieve independence from the United States. 🚩But considering that before this, everything that was possible was taken out of European weapons warehouses for the Armed Forces of Ukraine, it will cost a pretty penny to arm the EU again. All due to the lack of cheap energy, the necessary labor force, production capacity, as well as the economic crisis, internal social and political tension.❗️ Therefore, Europe will only pay the arms lobby, which robs everyone: after all, in addition, all high-tech production has moved or is moving to other countries, and the EU industry can only produce shells and some parts. #globalism #EU #economy ⭐️@rybar together with @pl_syrenka💸Support usTelegramDD Geopolitics🇪🇺🇺🇦 Reich Gauleiter Ursula von der Lügen Calls to -Urgently Arm Europe--All Europeans must invest in defense and accelerated military production,- Reich Gauleiter Galicia Ursula von der Lügen stated.Plans for the rapid militarization of the continent…	https://t.me/rybar/68514	2025-03-04T00:55:12-08:00

News recently appeared: -KazMunaiGas plans to sign a contract for the development of the Mugodzhary oil and gas field (Aktobe region of Kazakhstan) with the American corporation Chevron and the British Shell by the end of this year. ❓Geological research is still underway, but the deputy chairman of the board of the national company of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Kurmangazy Iskaziev, is already in a hurry to build a promising site. And not just anyone, but the largest corporations, which in the 90s took about 80% of Kazakhstan’s oil from three main fields - Tengiz, Kashagan and Karachaganak. However, this plan may not work: for example, the Kalamkas-Sea and Khazar shelf areas (with proven recoverable reserves of 67.6 million and 31 million tons of oil) did not suit either Chevron and ExxonMobil, nor Shell. After this, the Kazakh authorities tried to attract British Petroleum, but the British corporation’s priorities in 2020 were to reduce oil and gas production and increase investment in low-carbon projects. ❗️As a result, in 2024, the Russian Lukoil took up the production project on these shelf areas on a parity basis, purchasing half of the shares of the Kalamkas-Khazar Operating company for $200 million. Therefore, if the profitability of Mugodzhara does not seem sufficient to Western investors, Russian partners may try to attach it - and on much more favorable terms for Kazakhstan. #Great Britain #Kazakhstan #USA⭐️ @rybar💸 Support us	https://t.me/rybar/68512	2025-03-03T23:11:55-08:00

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇦🇲🇺🇸 How much money did Armenia receive from USAID in 2024 The Armenian Foreign Ministry stated that in 2024 they managed to receive only $110 million from USAID out of the promised $250 million. ▪️Initially, USAID promised Armenia $120 million, but in September 2024, the director of the USAID mission in Republic&nbsp;John Allelo signed an agreement with the Vice-President of the Republic of Armenia Mher Grigoryan to more than double the grant - to $250 million. Before the freeze of US foreign assistance and the actual defeat of USAID in Armenia, they managed to receive only $110 million. Of this, $49 million went to assisting the democratic transition. ▪️According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Armenia, money from USAID went to the following programs:➖&nbsp;the rule of law and human rights ($6.6 million),&nbsp;➖&nbsp;effective governance (about $18.9 million),&nbsp;➖&nbsp;political competition ($8 million),&nbsp;➖&nbsp;the formation of mutual consent (about $8 million),&nbsp;➖&nbsp;civil society and media ($13.6 million),&nbsp;➖humanitarian assistance ($1 million).▪️About $60 million was distributed between programs within the framework of -strengthening economic security-: about $29.8 million was allocated to increase private sector productivity, workforce development - about $3.2 million, provision of energy services - about $25.8 million.🔻Such vague formulations in the realities of the CIS mean that the Armenian authorities were simply given a bribe for the anti-Russian course being pursued. As recent revelations have shown, such assistance from USAID - for reforms - turned out to be ineffective, and in some cases even destructive. As you can see, Washington also spent millions of dollars supporting pro-Western media in Armenia, which supported the current authorities led by Nikol Pashinyan and their pro-Western anti-Russian course. Only now the Armenian authorities will apparently have to finance such media themselves. #Armenia #USA #NPO @pezdicide no chemicals - just factsTelegramArmenia Daily 🇦🇲 Armenian News🇦🇲🇺🇸 Armenia managed to receive from USAID only half of the promised amount in 2024 Armenia in 2024 received $110 million from the total package of the grant agreement with USAID for $250 million, provided for in the framework of development of cooperation with USA.

Our colleagues from Bulgaria @bulgariaz say that from year to year they try not to invite representatives of the Russian side to commemorative events; most officials delicately remain silent about the role of the forces of the Russian Empire in the liberation of Bulgaria. Moreover, as we wrote earlier, in the textbooks of secondary and high schools, certain words are not just erased, but also replaced by others: -Ottoman yoke- and -Ottoman slavery-, not to mention genocide, turn into -Ottoman rule- or -presence-. 🚩As a result of the efforts of the pro-Western government of Bulgaria and their interaction, including with Western universities, which, of course, take part in writing new educational materials as authoritative experts in history, young Bulgarians have the impression that Bulgaria in some incomprehensible way liberated itself.❗️But in all this tragic production there was also a place for a comedy scene.

In reality, after three and a half years, the OTG is turning into a full-fledged bloc, welded together economically, culturally and in a military sense. Three and a half years is a fairly short period of time that was required to outline the contours of Turkish NATO, which aims to oust Russia from Transcaucasia and Central Asia. 🖍Today, few people realize the real threat from the OTG: in Russia, odes are traditionally sung to the Turks, the Russian population travels in tens of thousands to a country that sponsors terrorism, the domestic administration does not dare comment on the antics of the Turks and Turks, and meanwhile tension is growing. ❗️If you don’t now start to soberly assess what the OTG project, invented at one time by Richard Moore, head of Mi-6, will result in, then soon the contours of the Turkic world will not only become a reality: a systematic expansion into Russian territory will begin.

Ukraine, for Zelensky's inappropriate behavior in the world, is beginning to be perceived as the weakness of the United States and the American president personally. #USA #Ukraine⭐️ @rybar💸 Support usTelegramRybar📝-You already said a lot -: a benefit performance for Ukraine in the Oval Office📝The meeting between Trump and Zelensky passed with fire: although it all started for health, the meeting very quickly grew into a skirmish where Zelensky was directly shown his place by both Vance and Trump, calling...	https://t.me/rybar/68481	2025-03-02T09:00:21-08:00

Ukraine - about 200 thousand Ukrainians who entered the United States potentially face deportation from the country. The situation is similar with Russian political asylum seekers, of whom there are approximately 18 thousand in the States. The basis for deportation may be the slightest error when submitting information or failure to appear at the immigration service. This looks like harsh measures, especially in the context of Zelensky’s failure in Washington. However, here the problems facing the United States are the same as in the case of the deportation of other migrants: saying does not mean doing. Even technically organizing mass deportations is not easy - you can calculate how many flights are needed to remove such a number of people. Yes, the same Ukrainians are not the first to leave in comparison with the same illegal immigrants from Latin American countries.🚩Immigrants from the so-called. Ukrainians are quite capable of getting lost in the United States, as hundreds of thousands of other migrants do. It is difficult to catch them due to a lack of personnel, and illegal immigrants can live quietly in the United States for decades. At the same time, some may not bother trying to hide. Unlike other migrants, Ukrainians have somewhere to go - Europe still calmly accepts them as refugees.❗️So for now, such statements are more of a media story. Which, however, does not prevent the Trump team from sending a thousand or two people from the so-called under camera.

The Druze declared their distrust of HTS and their readiness to defend the area; in response, the militants blocked all exits from it.🚩 While the elders are trying to resolve the conflict, a delegation has even arrived from Es-Suwayda. Its head has already promised a speedy reduction in tension and reported on the allegedly domestic background of the conflict. Against this background, the reaction of Israel, where a large Druze community also lives, looks curious: the IDF threatened to hit the forces of the new regime in the event of an assault on Jeramana. This coincides with the Israeli plans to support the Druze in Es-Suwayda. Regardless of further developments, what happened again shows that Syria remains a powder keg. And the position of the new authorities and Abu Muhammad al-Julani, despite all the diplomatic visits and negotiations, is much more precarious than it might seem. #Israel #Syria #terrorism⭐️ @rybar💸 Support us	https://t.me/rybar/68474	2025-03-02T02:45:44-08:00

Forwarded From Two MajorsStart above✨ Thus, despite the political theater along the Washington-Kyiv line, the West is not going to abandon the Ukrainian training ground, especially since Kyiv is still being used as a suicidal battering ram against Russia, and this meets the interests of the potential enemy countries. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, experiencing real problems with the number of personnel and the filling of units with manpower, are still conducting an organized and slow retreat, trying to wear down our troops in heavy battles, and are taking counterattack actions with limited goals. The ongoing international political crisis raises concerns about a possible new adventure by Zelensky to demonstrate his ability to resist the Russian Army. It is important to realize that even in the event of a complete cessation of supplies from the United States and Europe, the Armed Forces of Ukraine will be able to conduct an organized defense using old reserves for at least another six months. At the same time, these deliveries have not yet stopped, no matter what. The summary was compiled by: Two majors	https://t.me/rybar/68471	2025-03-01T21:23:06-08:00
🔁 #Review #Summary for March 2, 2025 ▪️ Show in the White House ...	Forwarded From Two Majors#Review #Summary for March 2, 2025▪️ The show in the White House organized by Trump and Zelensky became the most resonant event of the last week and is a sign of the redrawing of the political map of the planet by the world elites. Behind-the-scenes directors transfer the Kiev regime to fully provide for the EU countries, and Zelensky’s visit to London directly points to a new main interest in the continuation of the war. It is significant that all Western European bureaucrats expressed support for Zelensky after the disgrace in Washington, and he arrived on a visit to the UK. No less remarkable is the wording in which the British issued aid to the Armed Forces of Ukraine that day: for the general public it was called a loan, although everyone clearly understood that Ukraine was never going to pay its debts. In general, there is a transfer of control of the Ukrainian colonial troops from the United States to London, which does not do much for the Russian soldier on the battlefield. But so far, assistance from the states has not stopped. Military analysts count the number of cargo planes in Rzeszow, Starlink satellite communication systems continue to operate in the Ukrainian troops, and no information has been received about the recall of American military advisers.▪️ Against this background, the unexpected fraternization with the Americans in the media trenches and the media is somewhat surprising, as if for the last three years it was not the American HIMARS and ATACMS flying over our positions, but those burning in the Kursk region -Abrams- was conveyed by some other country. ▪️ In addition, the predicted reaction of European bureaucrats, who are closely sitting on percentages of funding from Ukraine and military-industrial corporations, indicates plans to increase assistance to the Armed Forces of Ukraine from the EU. This will happen at the expense of silent European taxpayers, who are being turned into duped Ukrainian-like cattle, which are systematically prepared for slaughter on the eastern front.▪️ Meanwhile, heavy fighting continues at the front, which determines Russia’s position in the international arena. In the Kursk region, the villages of Pogrebki and Orlovka Nikolsky were liberated this week. The offensive against Staraya Sorochina, Malaya Loknya, Lebedevka, and Viktorovka is developing. Ours crossed the State border a week ago and are moving towards the village with the heaviest fighting. Basovka, Sumy region through the settlement. Brand new. ▪️ Mutual strikes against rear areas continue. The Russian Armed Forces are ironing the port infrastructure of the Odessa region and facilities in Kyiv, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are responding with massive UAV launches. The most significant was the enemy’s attempt to destroy the Russkaya compressor station in the village. Gai-Kodzor (Krasnodar Territory), providing gas supply through the Turkish Stream pipeline. This is not the first time that such actions of Kyiv have taken place and are designed to completely sever Russia’s economic ties with Europe, hooking the latter, by the way, on American LNG, despite the show in the White House.▪️ The expansion of our bridgeheads in the north of the Kupyansky direction on the right bank of the river continued. Oskol. The Russian Armed Forces are advancing in the Krasnolimansky and Seversky directions with heavy fighting. There are battles for the complete liberation of the Hours of Yar. The situation in Dzerzhinsk (Toretsk) still resembles a layer cake; the Ukrainian Armed Forces are taking counter actions. There are battles south of Pokrovsk and north of Vozdvizhenka near the Pokrovsk-Konstantinovka highway. The battle for Constantinople continues. Far Eastern warriors are developing success north of Bolshaya (Velikaya) Novoselka, Skudnoye and Burlatskoye are liberated. On the Zaporozhye Front, the Russian Armed Forces are attacking in the Orekhovsky direction, and there are battles for Pyatikhatki. In the Kherson direction - actions in the island zone of the river floodplain. Dnieper and mutual strikes by the parties, shelling by the Armed Forces of Ukraine lead to the death of civilians.

At the same time, the Germans promise to hurry up with construction, since the situation in the Baltic Sea is becoming increasingly tense. However, serious doubts arise about this expensive undertaking: the government initially allocated 2.1 billion euros for the contract, and recently it turned out that the budget has grown - as much as 3.26 billion euros. And most likely, even this amount will not be final - the boats will be even more expensive. The German economy is clearly going through, to put it mildly, difficult times and the country’s budget is obviously already lacking in resources. But the authorities are allocating a huge amount of money for such a project, which is more like banal money laundering. The main proof of this is that all high-tech production is moving from Germany to the USA and other countries, while in Germany itself they are mainly just churning out ammunition. At the same time, the maximum that the German industry is capable of in the current situation and with today’s resources is to rivet parts for these boats.❗️ Although this crazy project will cope with the main task - the further economic destruction of Germany. #Germany #economy ⭐️@rybar together with @pl_syrenka💸Support usTelegramAnalytik &amp; News🇩🇪 Über 3 Mrd. für drei neue AufklärungsbooteAm 25.

Forwarded From Two Majors☢🇺🇦Against the background of the plunder of Ukrainian resources, which even the French are joining, the issue of potentially dangerous objects remains untouched. Ukraine inherited 5 nuclear power plants from the Soviet Union🛠. One of them, Zaporozhye, is already in relative safety under the control of Rosatom structures and is undergoing the necessary measures to minimize the damage that was caused to it during the period of barbaric exploitation by the Ukrainian operator. There are still Chernobyl (shut down), South Ukrainian, Khmelnytsky and Rivne nuclear power plants. By the beginning of 2022, 12 of the 15 reactors of these nuclear power plants were operating with an extended service life, and some even underwent a procedure of increasing the rated power by 3%, which did not in any way contribute to the careful use of aging equipment. Moreover, in an attempt to save money and abandon Russian fuel and components, the management of NAEC - Energoatom - embarked on a crazy experiment with Westinghouse🇺🇸 to replace Soviet (Russian) fuel elements at the 2nd and 3rd power units of the South Ukraine NPP and 1,3,4,5 ZNPP with American ones, which have fundamental design differences and are not intended for this type of reactor. As a result, the number of failures and emergency stops at these stations increased significantly and began to reach several dozen per year. Nevertheless, the plans included the installation of American fuel rods at reactor 3 of the Rivne NPP, and in the long term - at all operating reactors. Even now, Ukraine has not abandoned plans to introduce Western technologies at aging plants. In addition, theses periodically voiced by representatives of the ruling elite about the need to return nuclear weapons to Ukraine cast doubt on the possibility of independent operation of these facilities. The demonstrative attack of the Ukrainian forces on the Chernobyl nuclear power plant on the eve of the meeting of the contact group - Ramstein - which Ukraine presented as a nuclear escalation of Russia is indicative.✨The nearest enemy territory from the South Ukraine NPP LBS is 175 km, the farthest is more than 650 km (❗), which casts doubt on their imminent liberation. In these conditions, a solution to the problem could be Russia's proposal, as part of ensuring global nuclear safety, to create an international consortium to manage Ukraine's nuclear assets, which will significantly increase the degree of control over hazardous materials.✨⭐️We hope that the officials included in the negotiating groups understand the importance of this issue for ensuring the security of both Russia and the entire European continent.

The key event of today is the flight of the R-8A anti-submarine aircraft in the southeastern part of the Black Sea. This hasn't happened for a very, very long time. The R-8A has not gone beyond the coastal part of Romania for the last three years. And then it reached the southeast, made a circle north of Turkish Trabzon and went back. It is now flying nearby in the southern Black Sea, and only a few minutes ago the transponder was turned on. Not only does the R-8A have equipment to search and detect boats and ships, but it also has special buoys that it installs at low altitude. And these buoys make it possible to collect surrounding information. In addition, an RQ-4B drone from the Sigonella airbase and another P-8A are currently being sent to the Black Sea to replace the one returning from the sea. He also hasn’t been off the coast of Russia for a long time, so, apparently, something serious is planned in the coming days. #Russia #USAGlobalistics - subscribe to the channel	https://t.me/rybar/68437	2025-02-28T05:54:01-08:00

Allegedly, the suspension of USAID activities will put an end to the American plans to pump resources out of Central Africa. On the one hand, the USAID agency was indeed one of the sponsors of the project. However, its contribution is minimal: instead of training personnel and specialists, the organization was engaged, for example, in promoting feminism through women-farmers programs. And most of the costs for the initiative were promoted through the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC). This body was created during the first Trump administration with the aim of countering Chinese influence through investment projects.➖➖➖➖➖➖Actually, the Lobito corridor itself is the brainchild of the DFC, created in response to the Chinese railway line from Tanzania to the DRC TAZARA. Investments in it amounted to about $600 million, and Biden promised the same amount in his first and last trip to Africa. And this does not compare with USAID’s investment of $5 million.🔻So no one plans to close such a promising project. Moreover, from August 2024, supplies of Congolese copper and cobalt began to the United States, which were transported along this railway line.

More than a month has passed since the former representative of the United States, Daniel Rosenblum, left his post and went straight to retirement. Moreover, the date coincided with the entry into office of the Donald Trump administration. The day after Rosenblum’s resignation, a charge d’affaires ad interim of the US mission in Kazakhstan was appointed. It was diplomat Debbie Robinson. But Robinson, who spent most of her career in Pakistan, Afghanistan, the United Arab Emirates and India, appears to be a decidedly temporary figure. ➖➖➖➖➖➖📌This situation clearly worries recipients of State Department grants in Kazakhstan, who are rushing to release materials about the need to appoint a new ambassador. However, such a delay is not evidence of insufficient interest of the US authorities in Kazakhstan. The republic has plenty of natural resources and has an important geographical location. The main reason for the vacancy is the lack of reliable people in the new White House administration who can be entrusted with this post. Many ridiculed Trump for appointing his relatives to senior positions. However, this was not a simple desire to place a person in a cushy place, but an inevitable consequence of a lack of staff and trusted people. That is why there is no US Ambassador to Kazakhstan yet, and nothing has been heard about possible candidates.#Kazakhstan #USA@rybar Support UsUS Embassy and Consulate in KazakhstanUS Ambassador to Kazakhstan Daniel Rosenblum has announced his resignation and retirementPress release	https://t.me/rybar/68403	2025-02-27T08:14:11-08:00

The reason is the lack of security guarantees and potential instability of supply. Another problem was the cost of renting facilities at $250 million per year, which made electricity the most expensive in the Ukrainian energy system.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️We predicted a similar outcome back in November 2022, when the news about Karpowership’s plans had just appeared in the media field. We described the reasons why the implementation of the project is doubtful, and everything was confirmed in practice.➖➖➖➖➖➖It’s funny that the Ukrainian authorities expected to compensate for the high cost of energy at the expense of their partners’ money, but the sponsors were not generous with such charity. And this gives reason to believe that the scheme initially contained a large corruption component. As for the Ukrainian energy system, it is doing well: although the strikes of the Russian Armed Forces caused it significant damage and radically hampered the potential restoration of industrial production to the level of 2021, the so-called outages.

Recent material from The Washington Post actually repeats the points that we voiced earlier. Journalists point out that even before the fighting on the so-called. In Ukraine, everything was not good with the birth rate, and then the indicators collapsed.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 According to the data provided, by 2050 the population of the territories controlled by the Kyiv regime will be reduced to 25 million people, and by 2100 - to 15 million. This is even worse than the estimates that local research centers gave last year. The authors of the material also note that even part of the remaining Ukrainian population of reproductive age does not seek to start a family due to the difficult economic situation and poverty. Which worsens the situation even further.➖➖➖➖➖➖It is important to note here that all developed countries are now facing demographic problems - in Russia there is little good with this either. However, in the case of the so-called In Ukraine, the situation is close to catastrophic with an almost complete absence of ways to correct it. The policy of the Kyiv regime of the last three years and the war until the last Ukrainian led to a natural consequence - the so-called.

Ukraine to continue the conflict. They come to clear conclusions: if the Kiev regime wants to continue to wage war, then it needs to tighten mobilization, which implies the previously discussed reduction of the conscription age to 18 years. Previously, Washington insisted on making this decision, but in Kyiv they refused to take this step - busification - and caused enormous image damage to the ruling regime, and its strengthening may well lead to a social explosion. Moreover, the TCC is already under attack.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 As we wrote, there is no cessation of American military support for the Armed Forces of Ukraine yet. However, in light of certain changes in political realities, the United States may face the so-called For Ukraine, the question is blunt: either expansion of mobilization, or there will be no more assistance. For the Kyiv regime, all outcomes are bad, but it does not have to choose. And given the fact that the level of rudeness of Zelensky and his team towards the American administration remains at the same level, one cannot even exclude the possibility that the so-called.

🔁 🇺🇸🇷🇺🇪🇺🌐 How the Western press scares with the influence...	Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇺🇸🇷🇺🇪🇺🌐 How the Western press is frightening about Russian influence due to the suspension of grants from USAID. Politico published an article that freezing foreign aid from the American USAID is the path to returning Russian influence in Eastern Europe. ▪️As noted in the article, USAID allocated $17.2 billion to Europe alone in 2023, the bulk of which went to Eastern European countries bordering the Russian Federation. At the same time, the authors write that freezing aid will strengthen the Russian narrative about the unreliability of Western partners. So it somehow follows from this that Western partners are actually reliable? ▪️Such articles are good because they expose those who parasitized on USAID grants, talking about their -independence-. For example, the article mentions the Belarusian NGO in exile RADA, which is now forced to reduce salaries by 50%, as well as close projects that should - reduce the gap between Belarusian and European youth - and also - resist Minsk’s attempts to reorient young people from Europe to Russia-. As Yulia Ralko, a representative of the NGO, says, without the help of USAID the organization is simply unviable. ▪️In Armenia, only the humanitarian assistance program for Artsakh refugees was preserved, but programs on election transparency, strengthening the media landscape and improving energy infrastructure were closed. ▪️Grant eaters are also sounding the alarm about the situation in Georgia, where the so-called -the democratic movement- after stopping USAID funding will suffer even more than from the law on foreign agents. The head of the Georgian media project Project 64, Georgiy Gogua, admitted that USAID money accounted for 40% of his budget in 2025. Now he relies on European donors. ▪️At the same time, grant eaters admit that hopes for the EU are small, since local officials are notorious for their slowness, and the system is extremely bureaucratic. For example, in 2023 the EU allocated 19.6 billion euros to Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, Belarus and Armenia. However, in recent years, financial assistance from Brussels has been declining, with the exception of Ukraine and Moldova. As a result, the authors sound the alarm that the renewal of funding for -civil society- projects in Eastern Europe is directly related to the -strategic security- of the EU. In fact, the question is whether Brussels will be able to strain its budget so as to continue to interfere in the internal affairs of other states and teach someone -democracy-. #European Union #USA #Russia #NGO @pezdicide no chemicals - just factsPOLITICOUSAID freeze opens door to Russian influence in Eastern Europe – POLITICOCuts to aid from Washington could dramatically strengthen Moscow’s hand in the region and jeopardize Europe’s security interests.	https://t.me/rybar/68376	2025-02-26T10:29:57-08:00

Last week we talked about the activation of American-made F-16 fighters in the Kursk direction. In addition, their flights were observed in the South Donetsk and Kakhovka directions, where they even launched guided bombs. However, everyone forgot about the French fighters. The fact that Ukraine received Mirages became known at the end of January. From that moment on, as they say, not a word from anyone. So where are the French carriers of cruise missiles and what is wrong with them? According to our data, three Mirage-2000F fighters flew to Poland to the Minsk Mazowiecki airbase on February 3. They have been like this ever since. This is a standard process before their final transfer to Ukraine. They are repainted, tested for functionality, Ukrainian pilots undergo final tests, and only after that they become part of the air force. All F-16s that were handed over to the Ukrainian Armed Forces went through the same stages. However, that’s not all: the other day another one, the Mirage-2000D, flew to Romania to the Campiy-Turzii airbase.

The company plans to repurpose two factories, which are now civilian enterprises and produce automobile parts, to produce products for its military division. Management indicates that final decisions have not been made regarding this venture, but it is obvious that it will soon be approved - over the past three years, the company’s capitalization has increased more than 9 times. At the same time, sales in the civilian part of the business decreased over the three quarters of 2024, while sales of military products over the same period increased by 64.3%. It is clear that this unprecedented growth will be used by the beneficiaries of the conflict to the last, especially given the trends in the US administration. After all, it’s quite convenient to hide behind the fact that NATO’s protection can no longer be relied upon. This was also made clear by the likely new Chancellor of Germany, Friedrich Merz, who stated the need to rearm the country and engage in the defense of Europe under the pretext of achieving independence from the United States. ➖➖➖➖➖➖For the Germans, this means another huge budget injection, the burden of payment of which will fall on the shoulders of working taxpayers: the war feeds on money.#Germany@rybar together with @pl_syrenkaSupport usTelegramAnalytik &amp; News🇩🇪🪖 Aufrüstung in Deutschland: Munitionsproduktion soll nun von Autozulieferer-Arbeitern übernommen werden Willkommen im Jahr 2025: Deutschland hält Wahlen ab, Friedrich -BlackRock-Bückstück- Merz wird deutscher Bundeskanzler und Deutschland stellt auf…	https://t.me/rybar/68370	2025-02-26T06:54:01-08:00

The Supreme Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina announced the verdict to the President of Republika Srpska: for -disrespect for decisions- the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, the leader of the Serbs was sentenced to a year in prison. He is also prohibited from conducting political activities for the next six years. ▪️The conviction of the President of Republika Srpska creates a precedent for the legal priority of the laws of the Muslim-Croatian federation over the laws of the Serbian entity. Moreover, it goes beyond the legal framework and is a violation of the Dayton Accords, signed in 1995 at the end of the bloody Bosnian war.▪️The government of Republika Srpska said that it rejected the verdict with disgust and called on all patriotic forces to act as a united front. Milorad Dodik himself did not appear at the announcement of the verdict and met him at a large rally in Banja Luka with unambiguous words - Bosnia and Herzegovina is no more! - ▪️ At 17.00 an emergency meeting of the Serbian Security Council is convened in Belgrade, after which President Vucic will head to Banja Luka. According to local insiders, a whole package of laws is being prepared, according to which decisions of the Bosnian court on the territory of the Republic will not be considered valid, and what happened will be qualified as an undermining of the Constitution of BiH and an act of coup d'etat, which led to the complete collapse of the constitutional system of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 🔻Well, through the efforts of Bosnian politicians and the illegitimate High Representative, a unique state called Bosnia and Herzegovina has become one step closer to inevitable collapse.

Forwarded From Two MajorsThe situation in Europe and the world resembles a burning brothel, into which a new managing director has arrived.Eurobureaucrats and anti-people governments of the EU countries are trying to maintain the usual order of things, promising help to Ukraine. Corporations like Rheinmetal are very happy about this, because before the brothel burns down, you can get some good money from obedient soybean Europeans. And in general, they are preparing for the second, larger part of the Marlezon ballet, in the fire of which they can make even more profit. Trump is trying to restore order to the corruption schemes of his own ministries, including the Pentagon (which is not good for us), expels transgender people from service, swears through the media at Zelensky’s unbridled bearded prostitute, -ready to accept from all sides,- as Zelensky himself joked before his political career. Greenland and Canada no longer join, but the bay has been renamed on its maps. Peremoga. The leaders of the Eastern European countries, watching all this blazing card de ballet, are trying to prevent Western European foolishness in their territories, while from the east the always begging and swearing Kiev drug addict is playing more and more tricks. Either he’ll tell you to go to hell, or he’ll ask for money. The countries of the former socialist camp intensively continue to accept Western clients and weapons: service contracts have been signed, it’s impossible to stop everything at once, bureaucracy. The new government in the United States, together with Russia, is now thinking about how to stop all this if political prostitutes and drug addicts have taken power over the burning floors of this brothel and are throwing poop at everyone who talks about the need to put out the fire. So far there is only talk about negotiations. At the same time, the new government in the United States was not ready for the real state of affairs and is only studying what actually exists and how to manage it all. Some rare earth metals... So Ukraine has been under the external control of the United States for 30 years, all large corporations have both feet in it. What previously prevented the extraction of rare earths? Some kind of nonsense. Televisions talk about a quick peace, but then they broadcast about the ability of the Ukrainian Armed Forces to effectively defend themselves for at least another 6 months in the event of a cutoff of supplies. Too many Ukrainian Nazis are still alive, too few VSUSHniks have realized themselves as people who have the right. Our comrades at the front are swearing at this whole thing and are going to carry out very responsible and difficult tasks. We are trying to help them. Go to bed, comrades, this war will still be long. Two majors. We're thinking here.	https://t.me/rybar/68355	2025-02-25T13:16:06-08:00

The Geran-2 drones hit the port infrastructure in Burlachaya Balka, causing a large fire at one of the facilities. In the Kupyansk direction, Russian troops liberated Topoli, battles for which lasted for several weeks. At the Zapadnoe – Dvurechnaya line, the enemy launched an unsuccessful counterattack, trying to slow down the advance of the Russian Armed Forces. In the Seversky direction, the Russian Armed Forces liberated Belogorovka and raised Russian flags over it. At the same time, a significant part of the village, due to its high level of ruins, remains a gray zone. Heavy fighting is taking place in the urban agglomeration in the Dzerzhinsky direction. Ukrainian formations regularly launch counterattacks, throwing assault groups into the buildings. In the Pokrovsko-Mirnograd direction, the Russian Armed Forces expanded the zone of control north of Shevchenko and are now advancing towards Zverevo. This will allow some of the resources of the Ukrainian Armed Forces to be drawn away from Peschany, where fierce fighting continues. In the Vremevsky direction, the advanced units of the Russian troops, after a series of attacks, reached the approaches to Burlatsky and Privolny. In the Zaporozhye direction, according to some reports, the Russian Armed Forces cleared the territory of Pyatikhatki.

According to the publication, the White House abandoned the most stringent demands (we are talking about $500 billion), and in Kyiv they really hope that the agreement on joint exploration of resources will improve relations with the Trump administration. The updated agreement does not provide for complete US control over the fund. Instead, the United States will receive the maximum financial share allowed by its legislation.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌First of all, we should wait for the terms of the agreement to appear, which the authorities of the so-called Ukraine are ultimately ready to sign. However, the very fact that the Zelensky administration would eventually sign it was expected from the very beginning. Considering the behavior of the Ukrainian political elite, raising the price, making a scandal, and then agreeing is their standard model. Refusal to sign this agreement would put so-called Ukraine in a dead end. But there is a small nuance: as Zelensky recently said, the debt will literally be such that future generations will still have to pay. And no one, apparently, gives security guarantees to the so-called Ukraine. So the division of Ukrainian assets continues - and quite successfully. But not for Kyiv.#USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport usFtUkraine agrees minerals deal with USKyiv hopes agreement on jointly exploring resources will improve relations with Trump administration	https://t.me/rybar/68349	2025-02-25T11:12:10-08:00

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide📰🇪🇺 This has never happened before, and here it is again: foreign journalists found out that some of their colleagues received -grants- from the European Commission for positive articles about Brussels politics. The Hungarian newspaper Mandiner indicates that shortly before the European elections, EU authorities secretly sent 132 million euros to a number of media companies through the private advertising agency Havas Media France. At the same time, which media outlets received the money is not disclosed, but the conclusion of colleagues is clear - the task was set the same: to manipulate public opinion before voting. It is also known that the funds were transferred bypassing the traditional tender, which made it possible to hide the recipients of the funding. And the main beneficiaries of the order were EC President Ursula von der Leyen and European Parliament President Roberta Metsola, who, according to the Italian publication Il Fatto Quotidiano, directly controlled the distribution of budget funds. Journalists who uncovered the fraud argue that these tactics reflect methods used in authoritarian regimes, where state-funded media subtly control media narratives, preserving the illusion of independence of the press, and here it is in the European Union. And if earlier they reacted to this in the style of -that’s different,- now, it seems, public opinion as a whole demands an answer. The situation has become even more aggravated amid the recent scandal with the EU's shadow lobbying in favor of green policies: it turned out that the EC secretly financed environmental NGOs that promoted ambitious climate reforms. They were also used to put pressure on the governments of EU countries and members of the European Parliament. Considering how von der Leyen has been actively criticized lately, it looks like she will have to take the rap for herself and for that guy. #European Union #mediatechnology@pezdicide no chemistry - just factsTelegramKen Jebsen - Aufklärung und InformationWahlmanipulation von höchster Stelle: EU-Kommission Finanzierte Medien vor der Europawahl mit 132.88 Millionen Euro💥Vor der Europawahl finanzierte die EU-Kommission Medien mit einer Summe von 132.88 Millionen Euro für einen Zeitraum von 12 Monaten, wie…	https://t.me/rybar/68343	2025-02-25T06:34:38-08:00

For several days now, intensive air strikes have been carried out on the Odessa port infrastructure, which is actively used for military purposes. One of the priority areas has obviously become the Danube ports, to which foreign weapons and military equipment for the Armed Forces of Ukraine are delivered. At the same time, the analysis of satellite services for this period (in the picture) showed a previously uncharacteristic intensity of fires on the territory of Romania bordering Ukraine🇷🇴 - in the area of ​​the Sulina Arm (one of the three main branches of the Danube River Delta). It is significant that in this area there is a new positional area of ​​counteraction to low-flying air targets deployed by the Romanian Armed Forces since March 2024 (meaning UAV). Also in August 2024, the Deployable Air Command and Control Center (DACCC) redeployed the LANZA LTR-25 mobile radar with a crew from 🇮🇹Italy to the Romanian city of Cataloy (Tulcea County), located 25 km from the port of Izmail. Since the beginning of the NWO, NATO countries have additionally deployed the SAMP-T (MAMBA) air defense system, two GM200 radars, a TPS-43 radar, four F-16s and a TPS-80 radar to Romania. An indirect sign of the participation of NATO countries in repelling Russian attacks can be the coincidence with the large-scale Steadfast Dart 25 exercises being held on Romanian territory from January 13 to February 26, during which the deployment of the Rapid Reaction Force (ARF) to counter Russia is being practiced. It is known about at least two air defense units from France🇫🇷 (as part of the mission -Eagle-) and Spain🇪🇸 (from the Rey Alfonso XIII-II Legion brigade) participating in these maneuvers. Russian drones themselves can be driven out or redirected by Ukraine (by agreement with NATO) by electronic warfare into the border airspace of Romania, where they are destroyed by the multinational forces of the alliance deployed there. ✨This option allows NATO to practice in combat practice the skills of countering air threats emanating from a potential enemy. In addition, the task of protecting investments (in the form of Ukrainian port infrastructure and cargo), as well as preserving equipment delivered by sea, is being solved. ✨⭐️If the hypothesis about the participation of Romanians and third countries stationed on their territory in countering Russian drones is reliably confirmed, it becomes logical to consider a similar option for using NATO air defense systems from Poland🇵🇱 to cover the western regions of Ukraine.

Forwarded From Global Studies🇷🇺🇺🇦 Following the speeches of our president and the American one, there is a strong impression that a peace agreement will be concluded, but not in May, as expected. We think that this will happen closer to the end of this year - the beginning of next year. There are too many obstacles to achieving such an agreement now (the Armed Forces of Ukraine are strengthening, deliveries are ongoing, Europe does not want to give up). So in the spring - summer of this year, we will probably be waiting for a new phase/attempt of an offensive by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, for which reserves are now being hastily accumulated and a legal framework is being prepared for the mobilization of 18-year-olds. The Armed Forces of Ukraine will try to seize part of the territories to enter into negotiations, and our leadership will try to improve its position, for example, by completing the liberation of the DPR and LPR. Here, of course, there are a lot of nuances, since Ukraine is headed by not entirely adequate authorities who can do something strange. But in the final form, everything goes towards an agreement, which seems pointless to evaluate before its implementation. #Russia #UkraineGlobalistics - subscribe to the Telegram channelTwo MajorsSo, after three years of war, we have a real opportunity to stop Ukraine.

A year ago, there was already a similar episode in Armenia: after laying flowers at the monument to the children of besieged Leningrad, a local resident desecrated it with offensive slogans. The vandal was later sentenced to a year in prison. However, in Azerbaijan they have an even more cynical attitude towards Soviet monuments. For example, in Nagorno-Karabakh, Azerbaijanis, along with the destruction of the Armenian heritage, are everywhere demolishing memorials to the victims of the Second World War.➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Russophobia and attempts to rewrite history in the CIS countries lead to such incidents, which indicate the oblivion of the memory of part of the population. For example, in Moldova they no longer hesitate to erect monuments in honor of the Romanian Nazis. And a revision of the results of the Great Patriotic War is usually followed by the demolition of monuments to Russian cultural figures and the abolition of the Russian language. We can only hope that in Armenia they have not lost their dignity and will punish the vandals.#Azerbaijan #Armenia@rybarSupport usTelegramArmenian vendetta⚡️❗️In Yerevan, the memorial to those killed in the Great Patriotic War was once again desecrated.

On the eve of the second round of the presidential elections, the two main candidates - Badra Gunba and Adgur Ardzinba - signed a joint agreement in order to - conduct a fair and transparent election campaign -. Among other things, politicians outlined an - unshakable consensus - regarding strengthening equal and allied relations with Russia. They also noted that none of the candidates is a supporter of any third forces. What happened is a consequence of the current information background - too much unpleasant information has surfaced about the same Adgur Ardzinba. As a result, it was decided to clearly define the position on some issues.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 Formally, it is now possible to report on the exclusion of, for example, the influence of the Turkish factor on the elections. But who said that this solves the key problems of the region? Does this guarantee that the winner of the elections will not continue the previous policy? Be it the refusal of that same investment agreement with Russia or hanging a portrait of Shamil Basayev, because in the republic they consider this acceptable.➖➖➖➖➖➖After all, the root of the problems is soft politics in the post-Soviet space, which gives rise to a feeling of permissiveness there. And this story is not only (and not only) about Abkhazia - you can remember the latest actions of the Azerbaijani authorities. #Abkhazia #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/68317	2025-02-24T08:38:41-08:00

Boykov @AussieCossack organized another performance over the weekend - a car rally around Sydney with flags in honor of February 23. Of course, all this is a matter of taste and just trifles against the backdrop of a three-year Russian internecine bloodbath. But the question is different. How is it that the Russian emigration is not shy about Orthodox symbols, but Russian officials in warring Russia have terrible problems with this? Just a flashback to a hundred years ago. Remember how in 2023, on Kutuzovsky in Moscow, local authorities disrupted the Spas? How was Spas covered up on the federal channel a couple of months ago? How did the Russian Export Center in the UAE stage a crossfall the other day? Each time they corrected it only after the scandal in Telegram. I really want someone to bring this issue directly to V. Putin. Otherwise, the demiurges of domestic politics are clearly going somewhere in the wrong direction.	https://t.me/rybar/68315	2025-02-24T08:01:49-08:00

This is even more than what was at the Moscow film premiere in -October-! We are amazed. See for yourself. What is it actually about: on February 18, at the office of the Ural company Sima-land in Yekaterinburg, on the initiative of its owner and member of the board of trustees of the Russian Chess Federation Andrei Simanovsky, a screening of the first part of the tetralogy -At the Edge of the Abyss- took place. So Andrei Moiseevich took the baton from the President of the Russian Chess Federation Andrei Filatov, who shortly before invited us to hold a private screening in an incredibly high-status place - the Central Chess Player's House on Gogolevsky Boulevard (where the Federation's central office is located). In addition to the employees of Sima-land (and these are young people aged 20-25, which is especially valuable), the film was also watched by volunteers of the All-Russian Student Rescue Corps and honor guard company of the Central Military District. After the film, we (Maxim Fadeev and Sergei Belous) answered questions from shocked viewers who were wiping away tears, and also talked with some of the guys privately. The unreal emotions they experienced cannot be expressed in words. The film left an indelible imprint on the minds, and, we are sure, changed many of them.

As we already wrote, such rudeness is not only a manifestation of the level of cultural development of the top of the Kyiv regime, but also a conscious strategy of negotiations with sponsors, which worked well with the Biden administration and EU. However, the Trump team (unlike the European bureaucrats) is not delighted with the humiliation of those to whom they provided hundreds of billions of dollars in aid. And the figure of Zelensky is no longer considered irreplaceable there. In this connection, it is interesting what kind of reaction there will be to the attacks of the local regime.

We also expect the success of the right-wing AfD party, which, although it took first place in the lands of the former GDR, did not gain a majority. Now, on the wave of success, Merz calls for the formation of a new government as soon as possible, since its result (28.5%) does not give a majority in the Bundestag. At the same time, it remains not entirely clear with whom exactly the conservatives will form a coalition. Among others, the AfD, which is the main rival of Merz’s supporters, declared their readiness to work together. However, it can be said for sure that Merz’s policy as chancellor will be aimed at further economic destruction of Germany, including through both the adoption of tough (and suicidal) decisions regarding relations with Russia and the maintenance of the Kyiv regime. In this regard, Merz very conveniently appears in the media as a supposed defender of German sovereignty from the United States, but in reality everything gets worse. Especially for the Germans: the chancellor may be new, but the problems are the same and only continue to get worse.

French Carpi has shown interest in the construction of hydroelectric power stations on the Zeravshan River. This became known during a meeting between the Deputy Minister of Energy and Water Resources of the Republic of Tajikistan Manouchehra Safarzoda and representatives of the company. As part of the dialogue, Carpi expressed their readiness to participate in the implementation of priority projects in the country’s energy sector.📌 Since Tajikistan’s potential for the construction of hydroelectric power stations is quite high due to the terrain, the French apparently decided to try their luck in this direction. Tajik media hope that Carpi will contribute to the creation of a cascade of hydroelectric power stations, agreed with Uzbekistan back in 2018. Moreover, now Tajiks are seizing on any initiative coming from Western countries, amid a reduction in the number of projects due to the suspension of USAID. They will probably try to involve the company in completing the long-term construction of the Rogun hydroelectric power station. However, there is a nuance: previously they tried to interest the French in energy prospects in Kyrgyzstan. The discussion was about the construction of a hydroelectric power station by the French Electricite de France. But even after Sadyr Japarov’s visit to Paris, the matter never got off the ground.

The Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), Union 90/Greens (Grüne), Free Democratic Party (FDP), Alternative for Germany (AfD), Left Party (Die Linke), Free Voters (Freie Wähler), Volt Germany (Volt), are trying to be elected to the Bundestag (parliament). Marxist-Leninist Party of Germany❗❗ (MLPD), Union of Germany (Bündnis Deutschland), Sarah Wagenknecht Union (BSW), Christian Democratic Union (CDU). Based on the results, the winning parties, if they can create a new coalition, will form a government and approve a new chancellor. According to polls, this will be the leader of the CDU, Friedrich Merz. The former head of state, the bald-headed scarecrow Scholz, will most likely suffer a crushing defeat.✨Regardless of who wins these elections, the European bureaucracy will continue its course of confrontation with Russia. Despite the fact that among reasonable Germans there is a strong belief in the need to improve relations with Russia, the political elites of Germany have long been rotten and do not have the determination to act in the interests of their country. The story of the union of Sarah Wagenknecht is indicative, which, after a stunning start in local elections in 2024, slipped to the brink of elimination by February 2025. The reason was a sharp change in rhetoric (it declared the lifting of sanctions against Russia, the restoration of purchases of Russian energy resources and the normalization of relations) and the coalition with the SPD. ✨⭐️The new puppet chancellor will try to quickly fill her pockets with kickbacks from military-industrial companies that have pledged profits from the Ukrainian conflict for many years to come. For Ukrainians🐽 this will mean the continuation of meaningless resistance and agony. Russia is neither cold nor hot from the rearrangement of pawns in a state that has long lost its independence🇩🇪.

Rybar: Video 🇱🇧🇮🇱 The Israel Defense Forces did not finish celebrating the day of the funeral of Hezbollah leaders and for the first time published a video of the strikes on September 27, 2024, as a result of which the leader of the organization, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed. Along with Nasrallah, several high-ranking members of the organization were killed, including the head of counterintelligence, the head of the security service, etc. The deputy commander of the Iranian IRGC was also killed Abbas Nilforushan. They all then gathered for a meeting in an underground tunnel, which was destroyed by bunker-busting bombs in the densely populated area of ​​Beirut - Dahiya. Naturally, this led to dozens of dead and wounded civilians.

About a million people gathered in the stadium and surrounding areas. And the ceremony itself was more like a political rally. The main news of the funeral was the incident with the Israeli Air Force: F-15 and F-35 fighter jets flew over the stadium twice, trying to cause panic. However, the effect turned out to be the opposite - local residents, who had long been accustomed to such actions, responded only with insults against Israel. In general, the funeral really became a kind of referendum that confirmed the high demand of Lebanese society for political and military force capable of protecting its interests (the local army and government obviously do not satisfy it). But it's one thing to show support, and quite another to live up to expectations. Restoring Hezbollah's capabilities will take time, and only in a few years will it become clear whether the new leadership will be able to implement the trust it has received.#Lebanon@rybarSupport us Video is too big Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/68268	2025-02-23T05:51:20-08:00

The event was attended by specialized experts from all five republics. However, they were not the only ones. Representatives of the International Water Assessment Center (IWAC), the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), UNESCO and the Scientific Information Center of the Interstate Coordination Water Commission of Central Asia (SIC ICWC) with the financial support of the German Society for International Cooperation (GIZ) also arrived.➖➖➖➖➖➖The attention of Western organizations to the water topic is an old topic. Various international structures parasitize on the issue of distribution of water resources, which is important for Central Asia. Thanks to such seminars, representatives of Western structures, firstly, build channels of communication with Central Asian specialized specialists directly. Secondly, they ensure monitoring of their activities to coordinate water resources management. The point here is extremely simple: the West gains control over this issue, which means it will subsequently be able to manage the scarce resource of Central Asia.

Forwarded From Two Majors#Review #Report for the morning of February 23, 2025▪️ The world is approaching the third anniversary of the beginning of the North Military District in Ukraine in conversations about peace and Ukraine’s retribution for all its debts. The Ukraine project is ending and the main sponsor wants to make a profit from it. Each round of work on a mineral deal in Kyiv-controlled territory puts Zelensky at an even greater disadvantage, which amuses the online community. On the other hand, the United States lays claim to the mineral resources of the former Ukrainian SSR/territories of the Russian World (choose a convenient one), and for some reason the 300 billion dollars stolen by the EU from Russia are supposedly proposed to be spent on restoring the infrastructure of Ukraine. Apparently, politicians are reaching an agreement based on the formula - it is better to trade than to fight - which is somewhat different from the high goals of the North Caucasus, stated three years ago. So far, the conversations of politicians have not had a serious impact on the course of hostilities.▪️ Against this background, European countries are trying to prolong the conflict. European bureaucrats from Brussels, who personally benefit from aid to Ukraine, are talking about preparing a new aid package for the Armed Forces of Ukraine worth $20 billion. NATO infrastructure is being developed in EU countries; NATO plans to extend the two military pipelines existing in Germany to Poland and the Czech Republic in order to supply troops with kerosene and diesel in the event of a conflict with the Russian Federation. Europe, which itself has turned into a collective duped Ukraine, is preparing for war.▪️ Meanwhile, heavy fighting continues at the front. The Russian Army retains the strategic initiative, but it is still very early to talk about the collapse of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ defense. ▪️ In the Kursk region there are bloody battles throughout the penetration of the Ukrainian Armed Forces into the region. High-profile media news was the entry of Russian Army units south of Sverdlikovo into the Sumy region, but there is no need to talk about dissecting the enemy’s defenses: this is a tactical success of our troops, which provided the Ukrainian audience with food for thought about the feasibility of Zelensky’s Kursk adventure. The enemy is constantly pulling reinforcements into the region and taking counterattack actions. In the Kharkov direction in Volchansk, the advances of the Russian Armed Forces are measured in reports in tens of meters. The absence of a buffer zone near the Belgorod section of the border leads to daily Nazi attacks on the civilian population of the region. From the Bryansk direction they are talking about the enemy’s attempts to accumulate several thousand people for provocations on the border, however, clusters of the Ukrainian Armed Forces are constantly being destroyed by missile weapons and FABs, which has more than once thwarted the enemy’s plans. In the Kupyansky direction, the bridgehead of the Russian Armed Forces on the right bank of the river is expanding. Oskol. North and south of Ternov, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced the liberation of two settlements. North of Chasov Yar, Grigorovka was liberated. Fighting continues in the suburbs of Dzerzhinsk (Toretsk). South of Pokrovsk (Krasnoarmeysk) villages were changing hands, the enemy was counterattacking. The control zone of the Russian Armed Forces in the direction of the Pokrovsk-Konstantinovka highway has been expanded. The Kurakhovsky pocket is completely closed, Ulakly is liberated, battles for Constantinople are underway. Our troops are advancing north and west from Velikaya (Bolshaya) Novoselka. Novoselka and Novoocheretovatoe were taken. On the Zaporozhye Front there were oncoming battles in the Kamensky and Orekhovsky directions. The Kherson direction is abuzz with conversations and disputes about the possible crossing of the Dnieper by the Russian Army.▪️ Mutual drone strikes between the parties continue, and the Russian Armed Forces also use missile weapons against enemy targets. ▪️ No matter how anyone feels about the negotiation process, the Russian Army is at the front and forms a strong position for our diplomats. At the same time, the Kiev regime, forced to elect the head of state and pay compensation to Americans, is in a disadvantageous position: every day of the protracted war, the Russian Armed Forces are moving forward. On the other hand, it is the Ukrainian Armed Forces that are gradually retreating, so the negotiations/freeze should still be of more interest to Kyiv. Continuing hostilities on the part of Russia will also require more and more efforts in all areas, which, apparently, in the long term, raises concerns among the leadership about the social stability of the country. continued belowTelegramTwo majorsstarted above✨ Thus, the United States is interested in stopping spending on Ukraine and demands the immediate signing of a mineral treaty.

Forwarded From Marina Akhmedova The Mufti of Moscow from the Muslim Spiritual Directorate Alyautdinov allowed Muslims to perform prayers in... churches. Provided that the church minister does not object. He gave this permission after a man in Vologda entered the Church of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker and performed namaz there. The priest did not kick him out, which is understandable; he was simply confused. Here the question is - for what purpose did that Muslim go to church to perform namaz? Alyautdinov could say: -Don’t go, brothers and sisters, to church to perform prayers.- Rather than embarrass those who profess a different faith in their temple, it is better not to perform prayer at all this time, and then compensate for it. It is better to perform namaz on a bench under a tree than in a strange temple. And if for some reason you find yourself in a church and you absolutely need to pray, do not embarrass the parishioners of the church - for a Muslim believer this is a sin. Pray to the Lord in your soul in your own words. This is what an adequate mufti would answer, but Alyautdinov from the Muslim Spiritual Directorate is not like that, he needs a scandal every day. The DUM can no longer do without provocations and creates them out of the blue. Muslims never went to church to perform prayers, and Christians never entered a mosque with icons and crosses, unless, of course, we are talking about seizing churches and converting them into their own. History knew this too. So the prayer in the church, the crosses in the mosque give references specifically to the capture. It’s a pity that against the backdrop of these provocations, the voices of adequate muftis are not heard	https://t.me/rybar/68245	2025-02-22T11:15:29-08:00

Since 2014, militants of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, who received a criminal order to shell civilians in Donetsk, dug in in Avdiivka, located at a commanding height, turning it into a fortress city, strengthening all their positions with concrete. The approaches to the city are dotted with minefields, each building was turned into a pillbox with its own firing points, literally from every window there could be a machine gun crew, a sniper, or ordinary riflemen. Since 2014, every resident of Donbass has dreamed of liberating this city, hoping that after this his family and friends will be safer without constant shelling.

Their presence demonstrates not only symbolic support, but also confirms that Hezbollah still remains an important center of gravity for the Shiite communities of the region. This will be a serious challenge for the new leadership of the organization. The scale of the funeral actually turns it into an indicator of Hezbollah's political weight.

There is little information yet, but, as some observers say, the photo was taken while a convoy with armored vehicles was moving. Rumors that the Italians intend to transfer these models of light tanks to the Ukrainian Armed Forces (in Italy they are called tank destroyers) have been circulating since 2022. However, until now there has been no evidence of their transfer. But it is worth adding that Italian politicians do not particularly advertise supplies for the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Previously, the Italians transferred M109L self-propelled howitzers, but without an official announcement. Therefore, this option is quite in the spirit of Italy. As for the Centaurs themselves, they stopped being produced back in 2006. Now they are gradually being replaced with newer models, and apparently it was decided to transfer the decommissioned ones to Ukrainian formations. We do not rule out that this will be announced on February 24 at the Council of Europe. The very fact of their possible delivery confirms that the war is still far from over. European countries continue to pump up the Armed Forces of Ukraine with weapons, and light tanks will add mobility to the Armed Forces of Ukraine in a possible offensive.

The stated goal is to test the combat use of a multinational naval group. The parties are working on the issues of installing and removing sea minefields, ensuring the safety of navigation and joint maneuvering as part of patrol ship groups.➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Given that the entire last year was devoted to the fight of the American military against the Yemeni Houthis in the Red Sea region, such maneuvers look natural. In the event of a new escalation, the Americans will most likely try to involve coalition with more allies from Africa. Moreover, several members left Operation Prosperity Guardian last year, refusing to be under the command of US admirals.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 The trend towards increasing the scale of the exercises indicates increased American interest in East Africa.

Ukraine is the quintessence of what European diplomacy is today. The point is not only the ridiculousness of such statements against the backdrop of the fact that there are American troops on German territory, its enterprises are relocating to the United States, and the armed forces are suffering from a shortage of everything. The most comical thing is that these words were spoken only in the context of the so-called Ukraine. That is, the bureaucrats in Berlin for years did not see any problems in the gradual loss of state sovereignty. But they raised their voice when clouds hung over someone else’s boorish regime, which was eating up the German budget and publicly humiliating German politicians.

According to the publication, a split in the White House over the attitude towards Zelensky has long been brewing, and the question of elections is on the so-called. Ukraine began to rise a couple of months ago. At the same time, they have not yet chosen their candidate in Washington. On the one hand, this again gives reason to assume that Zelensky is already used material for the American administration. It’s funny that they are not sending him to Britain: apparently, there the leader of the Kyiv regime was also written off in favor of Zaluzhny. At the same time, within the Ukrainian political panopticon the struggle for becoming an American candidate will clearly intensify. Along the way, a lot of things will come to light that have been talked about for the last three years on the so-called. They preferred not to speak publicly to Ukraine.➖➖➖➖➖➖By the way, Zelensky himself is not going to leave yet: it is quite possible that in an attempt to hold on, he will do something else - from provocations to even more stupid and sewn with white thread things.#USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport usNew York PostExclusive | Zelensky's friend list dwindling in the Trump White House as peace...'I heard months ago it’s time for an election and new leadership,' one West Wing source claimed.	https://t.me/rybar/68218	2025-02-21T08:29:16-08:00

Moreover, some direct and indirect signs point to the preparation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces for the next offensive. One potential direction of attack could be the Bryansk region.▪️Unlike the Belgorod and Kursk regions, the enemy has not yet attempted to invade this border region with large forces - enemy activity mainly boiled down to the deployment of sabotage groups.▪️A special feature of the region is the abundance of wooded areas, which improves secrecy for concentration and invasion. In this case, the targets of the Armed Forces of Ukraine could be forests in the Klimovsky district or the Bryansk Forest reserve, which extends all the way to Bryansk.▪️The plan could be to reach the highways to Bryansk with the capture of one large and several small settlements. As before, media and political, rather than military, expediency may be put at the forefront in Kiev.➖➖➖➖➖➖The practice of world conflicts shows that on the eve of negotiations, bloody battles usually take place in the parties’ desire to achieve the most advantageous position. And it’s unlikely to be any different now.❗️Against this background, soothing materials from major media look ridiculous, where the possibility of an offensive by the Armed Forces of Ukraine is called -fake-. The consequences of such an underestimation of the enemy can be seen in the fate of the residents of the Sudzhansky district.

Forwarded From Two Majors🇩🇪 Rheinmetall has signed a contract worth €260,000,000 for the development of military logistics in Germany The German defense giant Rheinmetall has received a large order from the Bundeswehr for logistics support services. The framework agreement, worth €260 million, provides for the provision of comprehensive services for the redeployment of military forces within Germany, as well as their deployment abroad. This contract will be valid for an initial period of three years, with a possible extension until the end of 2029. This strengthens Rheinmetall's role not only in Germany. The contract, concluded with the Bundeswehr Federal Office for Infrastructure, Environment and Services (BAIUDBw), complies with the mutual defense clause of the NATO and EU agreements. Rheinmetall's new role involves the management, creation and operation of holding areas such as Convoy Support Centers (CSCs) and assembly areas along convoy routes within the Bundeswehr's Operationsplan Deutschland.✨ Rheinmetall's logistics services will extend to NATO, UN, EU and partner countries. Services include the establishment and maintenance of military holding and assembly areas, including the provision and operation of accommodation, sanitation, catering, shopping areas, gas stations, energy, waste management and security. For the Russian Army, this means recognizing Rheinmetall as a key player and a legitimate target within the enemy's ability to redeploy NATO forces in the region. Well, the company’s management has become one of the few in Europe who stands applauding Trump’s recent speeches on banned social networks. Rheinmetall shares have soared more than 30% in the past month alone. Therefore, it is somewhat surprising that many experts were so joyful and relaxed about the temporary cooling in relations between the United States and Europe. After all, this does not bode well for anything other than a natural multiple increase in the military power of European countries, which have long been hostile towards Russia.

However, such initiatives, seemingly small for the average person, are very important for building bridges between states. After all, some areas are not interesting to state actors due to the presence of larger tasks.

Forwarded From Colonel Trifonov - If you follow the instructions, no one will catch you! - This is a fatal lie of the Ukrainian special services when recruiting fragile Russians to commit sabotage and terrorist attacks. But this is reality: eight Russians were convicted in six regions for sabotage committed for the sake of quick money from the Ukrainian special services. In the territories of the Chelyabinsk, Orenburg, Kursk, Kemerovo, Belgorod regions and Krasnodar Territory, FSB officers identified and suppressed the activities of eight citizens of the Russian Federation: Dmitry Demidchik, born in 1997, Alexey Grigoriev, born in 1997. b., Moskaleva Maxim, born in 1994, Ermakova Egor, born in 2004, Golushko Victoria, born in 2001, Fomicheva Ilya, born in 2005, Gladkikh Eduard, born in 1999, and Chernooky Sergey, born in 1994, who, on the instructions of the Ukrainian special services carried out arson of transport infrastructure facilities, volunteer organizations, and also planned to commit terrorist acts in places where military units were stationed for minimal remuneration. To get involved in sabotage and terrorist activities, the Ukrainian special services used WhatsApp and Telegram messengers, as well as various open Internet platforms where advertisements for so-called quick earnings were posted. Court sentences sentenced them to imprisonment for a term of 16 to 22 years with 3 to 5 years in prison. Impressive. All of his youth, and what’s more, almost his entire life will be spent behind bars. Was it worth it? I think the answer is obvious.❗️How to avoid this? If you have come into contact with enemy intelligence, the best solution would be to go to the nearest FSB or Ministry of Internal Affairs agency and report it.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Note to Art. 205 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation: a person who participated in the preparation of a terrorist act is exempt from criminal liability if he, by timely warning the authorities or in another way, contributed to the prevention of the terrorist act and if the actions of this person do not contain another crime.

Exercises aimed at containing North Korea were again held in South Korea. Marine Corps soldiers conducted shooting on the islands of Yeonphendo and Pangnendo, located close to the territory of the DPRK. The main purpose of the exercises was to maintain the South Korean army in readiness for a hypothetical conflict with its neighbor. For this purpose, K-9 howitzers were used during training to practice striking the enemy. ➖➖➖➖➖➖📌Such exercises are considered to be aimed solely at defense. Until last summer, live-fire training was not conducted on the islands due to an agreement concluded between the DPRK and South Korea back in 2018. In the summer of 2024, the South Korean side suspended the agreement, so now exercises on the islands in the Yellow Sea are held quite often. As well as the broadcasting of audio propaganda on the border: it stopped for a while in 2018, but now the work of speakers can be heard from both the South and North Korean sides. ➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻In this particular case, there is no talk of a response to any actions of the North Korean military - the South Koreans once again decided to check the readiness of the equipment and military. However, this does not detract from the fact that such activity is creating a tense situation on the Korean Peninsula, where there are no signals of a possible détente.

The targets were energy infrastructure facilities. For example, in Novovelichkovskaya in the Dinsky district, an arrival at a substation was recorded, the damage was preliminary insignificant. Also, one drone fell in a field in the Kalininsky district. Another one was found in the village of Kholmskaya in the Abinsk region. In addition, there was an attempt to strike the Slavyansk EKO oil depot; our air defense and electronic warfare units destroyed seven UAVs. Two more were shot down by Pantsir near Korenovsk.❗️And now another group of drones has taken off from Odessa and is flying east. The target may again be the Krasnodar Territory or Crimea, as is usually the case. Therefore, once again we ask you not to rejoice ahead of time for what does not yet exist. The enemy does not give up and continues attacks on energy and oil infrastructure. And he does this methodically. Well, activity today is quite high, which may indicate preparation for larger-scale attacks, including the use of cruise missiles. #Russia #UkraineGlobalistics - subscribe to the channel	https://t.me/rybar/68179	2025-02-20T10:02:19-08:00

His belligerent rhetoric in 2022 and calls to create a peaceful armed NATO mission for the so-called. The Ukrainian politician explained that the situation was different then. Now the leader of the country’s main opposition force believes that Poland should take care of its own security. And this does not interfere with the anti-Russian vector of discourse: after all, the Baltic Sea, the Suwalki corridor and the Belarusian border have not gone away.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 Kaczynski’s turn is quite logical and caused by the desire to lead anti-Ukrainian sentiments in Polish society in order to gain political points. This is beneficial both before the presidential election and against the backdrop of the changing rhetoric of the US administration. Moreover, the Poles can make any statements - first one, then completely opposite. But in fact, the essence is the same: in the end, they will still do as they are told. #Poland #Ukraine@rybar together with @pl_syrenkaSupport usPolsat NewsJarosław Kaczyński zmienił zdanie co do wojska. -Społeczeństwo nie poprze-- Trzy lata temu była zupełnie inna sytuacja.

We talked about the company’s activities two years ago, also in the context of fire tests of the engine, which since then has undergone a series of modifications. In particular, the cooling circuit and other elements have been changed. The question may immediately arise – why is everything taking so long? So the very fact that the company has reached a working engine in metal and continues to bring it to fruition already says a lot. On our own, we wish SR Space further success in creating products and receiving the appropriate letter for them. Russian cosmonautics can no longer manage without successful private companies. #space #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/68175	2025-02-20T07:28:28-08:00

Formally, they are still frozen, but in fact the owners have already received the money. There is no need to see any connection with the current negotiations - work in this direction has been going on since 2023. Moreover, this was done using absolutely legal European mechanisms without any secret schemes.➖➖➖➖➖➖At the same time, neither the Russian Central Bank nor the EU actually provide a detailed structure of frozen assets. And it is possible that the current amount in frozen accounts in reality is very different from what is declared in the media.

Forwarded From SPECIAL FORCES ARCHANGEL🪖According to USAID in Tajikistan, it is important to monitor the information field in the republic in the coming weeks. The fact that state media and resources began to grieve over the closure of American Agency projects is only the first signal. In addition to the media, the participation of other structures in cooperation with USAID will also be revealed. It will be especially interesting to look at the fate of projects in the healthcare sector, including the military biological laboratory, which the Americans agreed on with the Tajiks last fall. The second point is military cooperation. In recent years, Tajikistan has actively interacted with the United States within the framework of exercises, and USAID played an important role in their organization. Although let us recall that Tajikistan is a member of the CSTO. The third point is who will take the place of USAID? A holy place is never empty, and someone will want to fill such a gap.

And National Security Advisor Tim Waltz noted that the United States does not intend to tolerate the rhetoric of the so-called.

This still works with Germany, France or Poland. However, Trump, unlike European politicians, did not want to enjoy public humiliation from narrow-minded representatives of the Kyiv regime. Therefore, Zelensky suddenly became a dictator without elections and a killer of journalists.➖➖➖➖➖➖And yet the media campaign does not mean that the United States is curtailing support for the so-called.

The country, through a system of well-fed politicians, judges, security officials and the media, is firmly integrated into NATO⚡️. Indicative was the cancellation of the results of the presidential elections in 2024, in connection with the victory in the first round of Kelin Georgescu, who announced plans to reduce the military presence of the US and NATO in the country. To increase influence, in August 2024 the United States appointed a new military attaché to Romania, Colonel Robert Kammerer, who was previously assigned to the 316th Squadron, 17th Airlift Wing, specializing in reconnaissance missions and training intelligence officers, translators and analysts for the US military. In addition, from 2025 to 2027, a contingent of US Marines will be deployed in Romania to conduct exercises and training. Against this background, Romania was included in the training programs for Ukrainian military personnel. At the same time, the army is being rearmed. By March 2025, it is planned to put two Patriot air defense missile batteries (4-16 launchers each) on combat duty. The State Department approved the sale of 186 AIM-120C-8 AMRAAM missiles and equipment worth $592 million, as well as 32 F-35A fighters worth $7.2 billion. Under the Foreign Military Sales program, 44 AAV-7 amphibious landing vehicles will be purchased (for $210 million), which are capable of moving through water up to 37 km. The possibility of purchasing two Independence-class ships from the US Navy for $300 million is USS Jackson (LCS 6) and USS Montgomery (LCS 8). For the previously purchased squadron of F-16 fighters, the modernization of the 71st air base - General Emanoil Ionescu - in the village of Campia Turzi (costing 90 million euros) has begun. The military potential is being strengthened. by increasing the capacity of the military-industrial complex. As part of the contract (for 857 million euros) with the Turkish company OTOKAR, 278 4x4 COBRA II armored fighting vehicles will be supplied, another 781 must be produced in Romania under a Turkish license within 5 years. 🇰🇷The South Korean company Hanwha Aerospace will begin construction of a plant in Romania to localize the production of K9 self-propelled guns. The first howitzers will be transferred to the Romanian army at the beginning of 2027.✨In general, the military activity of NATO countries⚡️ in Romania remained intense throughout 2024 and in 2025 began with large-scale exercises Steadfast Dart, the purpose of which was to practice the transfer of military contingents of the alliance along sea and land routes from west to east - to prepared Romanian frontiers. In the scenario of a future war with Russia, Romania is assigned the role of the first echelon. In this context, the introduction of hours of Russian language study in military educational institutions is indicative. In addition, preparations have begun to strengthen mobilization potential. The law on preparing the population for defense (the law on mobilization) is at the stage of departmental approval. Efforts are being made to increase recruitment into the armed forces, where the officer shortage is 43%, by incentivizing military personnel and intensifying the indoctrination of schoolchildren. ✨⭐️The nature of these military preparations does not in any way correlate with the defensive goals of the measures voiced by NATO ⚡️ functionaries, rather strengthening confidence in the preparation of offensive actions in all areas of the eastern flank.

Since February 10, the American exercises Justified Accord 2025 have been taking place in Kenya, Tanzania and Djibouti. 1,300 people are taking part in them, including British instructors. The Americans brought in units stationed in Somalia for the maneuvers. Tactically, the emphasis is on preventing crisis situations. However, as the Archangel of Special Forces correctly notes, the Americans themselves support them. For example, the US Air Force provided military assistance to the forces of the autonomous region of Puntland, and not to the Somali authorities, from which they separated.▪️The main objective of the event is to maintain military contacts between the US and African countries, especially in light of the growing Chinese influence. Last year, in the same Tanzania, large-scale exercises were held with the armed forces of the PRC, which clearly caused dissatisfaction in the White House. The increased activity of various militants in Somalia and political upheavals in Kenya, which were sponsored by USAID, contribute to the appeal to American military support in these countries. This example shows the principle of divide and rule, which has long been rooted in Western politics. And judging by the fact that last year Kenya received the status of a non-NATO ally from the Americans, the teachings are bearing fruit, gradually strengthening the military influence of the United States in the countries of the Dark Continent. #Africa #Kenya #Somalia #USA #Tanzania@rybarSupport usTelegramARCHANGEL SPECIAL FORCES🪖Americans strengthen cooperation with African countriesSince February 10, the Justified Accord 2025 exercise is taking place in three East African countries (Kenya, Tanzania and Djibouti).

Naval forces of the United States, China, Vietnam, the Philippines, South Korea, Turkey and other countries take part in the training.

A recording of a conversation between Enver Bganba, the 44-year-old nephew of the acting acting governor, appeared online. President of Abkhazia. And he is a supporter of Ardzinba.▪️According to Enver Bganba, Armenians pose a threat in the upcoming second round of elections, and they need to change their choice in favor of Ardzinba. And this, in his opinion, can only be achieved by force.▪️Ardzinba’s followers began to publicly threaten the Armenians of Abkhazia. In response, the Armenian community of Abkhazia published an open letter addressed to officials and candidates, demanding action. ➖➖➖➖➖➖Armenians make up about 40 thousand people, with the total population of Abkhazia being about 250 thousand. This is a significant part, so playing the anti-Armenian card is quite reckless and dangerous. However, if you remember which side Ardzinba (Turkey) adheres to, then such steps on his part are quite expected. Especially on the eve of the second round, since the situation of the latter is unstable, and destabilization is considered by him as the only available option.#Abkhazia #elections@rybarSupport usTelegramDTM🇬🇪 Ardzinba is preparing to play the -Armenian card- ▪️So, Abkhazia has gone to the second round of the presidential elections.

Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan at a government meeting stated the need to look for alternative options for supplying key food products to the republic. Pashinyan did not voice the details, but such a phrase is indicative against the background of his political aspirations. ❗️Armenia is extremely dependent on grain supplies from Russia, and the local Armenian market provides only a minimal part of the needs. However, that too decreased after the loss of Artsakh. Almost the entire volume of sunflower oil and part of the sugar is also imported from the Russian Federation. Armenia's ambitions to join the EU conflict with membership in the EAEU and deep economic ties with the Russian Federation. Western politicians have repeatedly spoken out about the need to sever Russian-Armenian relations. So Armenia’s attempt to revise its food policy fits into this logic. 🔻But what alternatives can be found in Armenia? Potentially, Armenia can purchase grain from Kazakhstan, especially since similar negotiations were already held in the summer of 2024. In addition, Kazakhstan is trying to return to the Azerbaijani market. It is clear that Kazakhstan is a member of the EAEU, but in Astana in 2024 they already made hints about -grain wars-. For Armenia, this is another step towards deeper integration into the Turkic world through the so-called. Middle corridor. However, these are still theoretical aspirations. Another question is how ready the infrastructure of Kazakhstan is for such an expansion of markets. #Armenia #Russia@rybarSupport usSputnik ArmeniaPashinyan instructed to look for alternative options for the supply of key food products.

Ukraine to prepare negotiations with the United States. Such statements are fully justified: the Kiev regime has long established itself in the image of a collective monkey with a grenade, not disdaining either public cooperation with Al-Qaeda or sabotage on international infrastructure. The blow to the CPC, part of the shares of which belongs to Chevron and other companies from the United States, fits well with this logic of the Ukrainian leadership. We would not be surprised if one of their goals was also to punish Kazakhstan for its ties with Russia by reducing the pumping of Kazakh oil. So, as negotiations intensify, we should expect new attacks on such objects: the further, the more so-called. Ukraine will increasingly behave like a mad dog, biting even the hand that feeds. #Kazakhstan #Russia #USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramRIA NovostiThe attack on the CPC was most likely Ukraine’s response to US plans for negotiations with Russia, Novak said. -The US response from Ukraine regarding those negotiations that were planned,- he said at a meeting with Putin.	https://t.me/rybar/68126	2025-02-18T08:56:42-08:00

On the other hand, to recoup the costs of the so-called Ukraine will still not get out in this way due to the fact that the volume of allocated military assistance is not comparable with the current profits from mining in the territory controlled by the Kyiv regime.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 However, who said that the United States actually wants to return the amounts in monetary terms, and not use the situation as a pretext for other political solutions?➖➖➖➖➖➖After all, Washington can solve several problems in one shot: punch the EU on the nose, answer the question of its citizens - why did they spend billions on the so-called.

🔁🖼 ⚡️🇪🇺🇺🇦Against the backdrop of military preparations in E...	Forwarded From Two Majors⚡️🇪🇺🇺🇦Against the backdrop of military preparations in Europe, Ukraine continues to implement logistics projects. The results of the EU audit of the Military Mobility Action Plan concluded that there has been insufficient progress, despite the full expenditure of the budget for these purposes for the period 2021-2027 (1.7 billion euros). It turned out that the transfer of tanks and other heavy vehicles is complicated between the countries of the union, due to the difference in traffic rules (❗). In addition, there is an insufficiency of funds allocated for projects on the southern route in the direction of Ukraine. However, through other instruments, financing of Ukrainian logistics with EU countries continued. One of the elements was the development of checkpoints (CPP) on the border with EU countries. One of the main logistics hubs to Europe is being formed in the Lviv region. On January 15, 2025, on the border with Poland 🇵🇱 an updated checkpoint was opened at the station -Mostyska-II-, which is equipped with a transition system between the European gauge (1435 mm) and the Soviet one. The reconstruction was financed by the European Investment Bank and the CEF Fund. Two new routes for container transportation will pass through Mostyskaya: one to the industrial zone in Duisburg, Germany, where the inland river port is located, the second from Kyiv to Polish Slavkow. In July 2024, within the framework of the European project - Solidarity Stripes - at the border crossing point - Chop - with Hungary 🇭🇺) a new mobile cargo scanner has been installed, which has accelerated the passage of cargo by half (up to one hour). At the expense of (85.91 million euros) from the CEF fund and its own funds, Ukraine will develop project documentation for the extension of the Eurogauge in the direction of Lviv and on the sections Lviv - Chernivtsi - Vadul-Siret - border with Romania by 2027 🇷🇴, conduct construction and electrification of tracks with a width of 1435 mm in small areas near the crossing point and electrification of the Chop - Uzhgorod section. For the latter, equipment has already been ordered (alarm devices, centralization and blocking (SCB), communications and radio communications) at the expense of -Ukrzaliznytsia-. In addition, at the Chop railway junction, the time for moving cars from Soviet-standard bogies to European ones has already been halved (to one hour). At the same time, efforts are being made to increase the capabilities of the port infrastructure. The ports of Izmail, Odessa and Nikolaev will undergo reconstruction of railway tracks and infrastructure in 2025 (expenditures of 50 million euros are planned). The West's interest in further increasing freight traffic in the Ukrainian direction is also indicated by the provision of a loan of 300 million euros by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and an investment grant from the World Bank in the amount of up to $190 million for the purchase of new electric locomotives. Among the immediate plans is also the development of road communication with Romania, within the framework of which it is planned to build a road border bridge between the settlements of Bila Tserkva (Ukraine) and Sigetu-Marmatia (Romania), an agreement on which was signed in December 2024.✨Our opponents, under the guise of civilian projects, are laying the foundation for the use of this infrastructure for military purposes. This means that in peacetime it will pay for itself by exporting Ukrainian resources, and in wartime by transporting NATO contingents to the Russian borders. The scale of these projects, taking into account those we announced earlier, indicates the thoroughness of military preparations for a major conflict in Europe.

Ukraine. And if earlier (the first month or two) they acted veiledly, now Poland is fully enjoying the dominance of Ukrainian gangs. They do not hesitate to attack in broad daylight, sell drugs, sell girls, and also harshly and openly blackmail fellow citizens. Yes, one of the main entertainments of groups from Ukraine is to come to Ukrainians who are organizing their own business in Poland and demand money from them for -protection-. Of course, if the entrepreneur refuses, trouble awaits in the form of sudden arson or attacks on the street. At the same time, the situation in Poland is now difficult - in addition to the serious internal political crisis before the presidential elections, there are more than 14 thousand vacancies in the republic’s police. For example, in Warsaw there are up to 150 cases to investigate per officer.

Forwarded From Older than Edda When the Americans at the last stage generously poured out sanctions against Russia with the maximum complication of their possible removal, they did this, knowing full well that one day another group of elites might come to power in the United States, for whom the conflict with Russia is not an end in itself, and they will try to curtail it. It was to complicate these attempts that this system was invented. This is a lesson for us both in domestic and foreign policy. On the external side, here and now we need to ensure that the signed peace is as difficult as possible to break if the next American administration wants to do this. And on the internal side, there is the feeling that -the NWO will end - everyone will be returned, -import substitution is so, playing for the public, and so on, occurs too often among a large number of different people. And to increase the reliability of our own planning, so that the same business does not worry that it will kill a project with a 15-year payback, because someone agreed with someone, they need us too. First of all, for ourselves.	https://t.me/rybar/68111	2025-02-17T13:00:39-08:00

The reason is the increasing number of cases of detection there of drone components and elements for creating explosive devices, which the SBU and GUR transport to their terrorist cells in Russia through Turkish territory. The actions of Turkish law enforcement officers are not due to charity, but their own interest: part of the cargo ends up with local criminals - there have already been several terrorist attacks in the country using Ukrainian explosives. What is happening is a natural consequence of the transformation of the so-called. Ukraine into a collective monkey with a grenade, which in the foreseeable future will still cause similar problems to its near and distant neighbors.#terrorism #Turkey #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇩🇪🇺🇦 New revelations about sabotage on the Nord Streams The German publication Der Spiegel published another sensation about the bombing -Nord Streams-: according to journalists, its performers were allegedly 12 citizens of the so-called.

The decision was made while reviewing the financing of external programs by the new US administration. Subsidies for Moldova were provided for by the Consortium for Conducting Elections and Strengthening the Political Process, which has now been liquidated. Its total budget was $486 million. Musk noted that the United States has a $2 trillion deficit, and if such expenses are not reduced, the country could go bankrupt. 🔻However, at this rate, the office of the President of Moldova, headed by Maia Sandu, will go bankrupt, which survives only due to American and European injections into a half-dead economy that is being destroyed by anti-Russian policies. At the same time, most of Western aid goes into the pockets of the president’s team. Sandu was very lucky that she managed to be re-elected for a second term before the change of administration in the United States. Chisinau has already admitted that after the suspension of USAID tranches, justice reform stalled, which could only be resumed after the transfer of money from the EU. It seems that the Sandu regime now depends only on the will of Brussels. #Moldova #USA @rybarSupport usradiomoldova.mdElon Musk's department cancels $22 million in funding for electoral processes in MoldovaThe Republic of Moldova will lose $22 million in financial support following the decision of the US Department of Government Effectiveness (DOGE) to cancel a $486 million fund for the -Electoral and Political Process Strengthening Consortium-…	https://t.me/rybar/68106	2025-02-17T08:23:07-08:00

USAID turned out to be involved in financing a number of terrorist organizations banned in Russia, which America fought so hard in the press and on TV - the agency generously paid IS, Al-Qaeda, Boko Haram, etc. 📌 For example, despite the Taliban seizing power in Afghanistan in 2021, last year alone the US sent them $697 million, including $534 million through USAID. Moreover, every 7-10 days cash worth from $40 to $80 million was delivered to Afghanistan - no one found out where they were going. There was also money laundering in the -inclusion programs-: -Women's Scholarship Fund- and -Young Women Led- were funded by USAID in the amount of $60 and $5 million a year, and already in Afghanistan the funds were redirected to the training camps of ISIS terrorists.🔻Once again, the popular theories for which the liberal media labeled everyone as conspiracy theorists turned out to be true - not only facts of sponsorship of the international terrorism, but also terrorist-related money laundering and money-splitting schemes by American bureaucrats. ➖➖➖➖➖➖Apparently, there are still many new and interesting things waiting for us in the future - after all, there is still an audit of the American Department of Defense ahead. ISISShocking DOGE investigation exposes decades of US taxpayer dollars funneled to terrorist groups via USAID. Congress admits to $697M annual funding, cash shipments, and Taliban -welfare-payments.	https://t.me/rybar/68103	2025-02-17T05:31:15-08:00
🇷🇺 News about the possible return of foreign clothing brands in...	🇷🇺 News about the possible return of foreign clothing brands in some places caused an unexpected sensation in the media field, they say allowing them to come back to the Russian market is a manifestation of a cargo cult. However, in general, the situation with brands demonstrates completely opposite things: since the collapse of the USSR, the so-called. Western worship of foreign brands has become several orders of magnitude less. After all, with the beginning of the Northern Military District, it turned out that 30 years of presence in the country of McDonald's or IKEA did not turn citizens into universal agents of the State Department and rootless cosmopolitans. And their departure was received by the population quite calmly. Why? Yes, because in food and clothing brands today, Russian residents most often see... only food and clothing, and not something sacred. That is, in relation to this area, the cargo cult has practically lost its relevance. It’s paradoxical, but discussing the event in the context of the fundamental inadmissibility of stores with Uniqlo or H&amp;M emblems returning to shopping centers only contributes to artificially inflating their significance. Which, in fact, is the very cargo cult that it is proposed to fight with such amazing measures. Of course, all this does not remove the questions - payoffs - for the opportunity to return to Russia or open stores in new regions: they lie in the financial and political plane and have nothing to do with the cargo cult. #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramBefore anyone else.

This is a continuation of the topic that the Ukrainian authorities themselves began, offering control over their mineral reserves as compensation for military assistance from US side. ➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 From the point of view of the likelihood of such a scenario, one should turn to Syria. The American contingent in Syria has been stationed in this country for many years and remains there for only one purpose - protecting oil and gas fields in the province of Deir ez-Zor. The war with the Islamic State ended a long time ago, and units of the US Armed Forces remained to protect their interests, simultaneously providing support to the Kurds from the SDF. So in theory, such a scenario is possible, but this is only in theory.➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻In practice, we have already noted the fact that the Ukrainian authorities are selling -air- in the hope that no one will notice it. Resource reserves in so-called Ukraine have not been confirmed. No one knows whether there is at least some of the minerals declared by Zelensky. Almost everything valuable that was on the territory of so-called Ukraine was taken out in the previous three years of the North Military District. And the other part is under the control of Russia, so all this talk is elementary populism in order to draw attention to something that, in reality, most likely does not exist. #USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport usNBC NewsTrump officials pitch Zelenskyy on U.S. owning 50% of Ukraine's rare earth mineralsThe Trump administration indicated U.S. troops could be deployed to provide security in connection with the minerals if there’s a peace deal with Russia, sources told NBC News.	https://t.me/rybar/68078	2025-02-16T09:34:01-08:00

And has anyone set such a task at the state level? No. Take the same fashion industry. After February 2022, Russian brands turned around well. Some people got really sick. Only they remained working within the framework of that same Western cargo cult. Let's say, what is the difference between the same Russian Lime and the outgoing Zara? Nothing. Same values. Only the other four Latin letters. Moreover, Lime has a Muslim collection (since the company entered the UAE market), but the Russian one has not appeared even for the Russian market, not to mention promoting Russian motifs for export. And the company is from Samara. About Latin letters. Russian brands routinely use the Latin alphabet in their names, as if the owners experience some kind of inferiority complex because of the Russian language, although 99% of sales are exclusively within Russia, well, at most in a couple of Russian-speaking countries of the ex-USSR. It’s quite strange when even individual materials are published that explain to readers how to correctly pronounce Russian names:▪️Lime = Lime▪️12Storeez = Twelve Stories▪️Avgvst = August▪️Ushatava = UshatAva▪️2Mood = Tu Mud▪️Charuel = Charuel▪️MATÜ = MatYu▪️Askent = Askent▪️SHU = Shyu▪️Thomas Munz = Thomas Munz Therefore, until the victory over Western cargo cult inside Russia is still a long way off. To be honest, I would simply oblige Russian companies to use the Cyrillic alphabet in the names of their brands for the Russian market. There will be such a law - they will start to think carefully about what to name their brand, how well it sounds in Russian and what semantic meaning it carries. Telegram Andrey Medvedev They report that the brands Zara, Bershka, Pull&amp;Bear, Stradivarius are planning to return to the Russian market. I don’t really understand, should we be happy about this? Should we thank fate that the European holding has deigned to return its stores? I really hope...	https://t.me/rybar/68077	2025-02-16T08:43:01-08:00

But under these conditions: - a billion rubles for the opportunity to return. The entrance ticket, so to speak - discounts for all SVO participants and their families - clothing lines in collaboration with Lobaev Arms, UralDronZavod, etc. They also make lines with Columbia Pictures. Rocky Balboa T-shirts. And then there will be drone -Ghoul T-shirts. Under these conditions, let them come in. But, as we understand, no one will put forward exactly such conditions to them. So it’s better to get the fuck off the beach right away. They left because -there’s no war-. Officially. Well, okay, we respect someone else’s right to have their own position. However, everyone understands why Western brands left. This was part of a political campaign: we will punish the Russians for the SVO, they will shake up the situation in the country. The departure of brands is a common sanction. This is how they punished primarily the Russian rather flimsy middle class and city dwellers. -You are used to buying inexpensive things for children, we will deprive you of this, since you voted for Putin and do not want to overthrow him.- Western leaders openly said that Russians should be punished. Now what has changed? Is the war over? Or did they start loving Russians? Or is it that the chief dog handler in Washington has changed and now we have to wag our tail in the other direction? And I seriously hope that Russian clothing manufacturers, such as Gloria Jeans, or Lime, will make every effort and involve all the lobbyists to prevent Zara and others from returning. The state’s task is to provide protectionism to its producers. Moreover, these three years have given impetus to the development of the industry. Well, why curtail this? https://t.me/vladivostok1978/18532TelegramEvgeniy Popov / popovrtrLet them come back, Andrey. But they will pay for it. The output is the ruble.

The turnout was 69%, but the winner could not be identified. After the votes were counted, it turned out that none of the candidates was able to overcome the 50 percent threshold. Now Abkhazia faces a second round of voting, in two weeks on March 1. Badra Gunba and Adgur Ardzinba will compete for the presidency in the second round, who received 46.38% and 36.9% of the votes, respectively.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 The second round, in conditions of relative parity between the two key candidates, became a logical consequence, and now the votes of the eliminated candidates can influence the presidential race. However, it is important to note that for our country the situation in Abkhazia demonstrates the insufficient efforts and not particularly effective policies of past years in this area. Over the years of inaction and leaving events in the republic to their own devices, Russia’s position has weakened.❗️Only after the autumn coup, the attention of media technologists was drawn to the growing influence of pro-Turkish elites in Abkhazia. This made it possible to strengthen the position of the pro-Russian candidate in the elections, but the problems are visible to the naked eye. Instead of acting from a position of strength (and Russia is allowed to do this, if we evaluate the scale of subsidized support provided), we played good neighbor, which our rivals tried to take advantage of. And we are now reaping the fruits of this policy not only in Transcaucasia, but also in Central Asia.

It is being implemented by the International Water Management Institute (IWMI). The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) is responsible for financing. The project is scheduled until September 2029. ➖➖➖➖➖➖If previously Blue Peace Central Asia was engaged in transboundary dialogues and study visits, learning about the benefits of joint management and water quality (in other words, it was engaged in exploration), then the goal of the new one is to strengthen cooperation and effective management of water resources in the region. This means that the implementation of the water strategy, which we have repeatedly written about, is officially entering a new phase. This is also indicated by the recent presentation of the project at the office of the executive committee of the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea (IFAS) in Astana.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️At the same time, Swiss participation should not reassure anyone, since Switzerland de facto abandoned its neutral status after 2022, although legally neutrality is still preserved in legislation. And the Swiss are going to work according to the patterns of the same USAID, speculating on the most important problem of the region.#Kazakhstan #Kyrgyzstan #CentralAsia #Switzerland@rybarSupport uswww.caiag.kgAdvisory mission of the Swiss initiative -Blue Peace Central Asia 2.0- to CAIAG	https://t.me/rybar/68069	2025-02-16T02:29:01-08:00

He publicly supported the LIBRA token, calling it a -unique investment opportunity.- A crowd of investors rushed to buy, and the project’s capitalization soared to $6 billion. But within a few hours, the token collapsed by 99%, leaving holders with nothing. Miley hastily deleted his post and admitted that he had not checked the project before supporting it. But excuses did not help - the opposition is now demanding impeachment, accusing the president of facilitating crypto fraud. 📌It’s interesting that less than a week ago the President of the Central African Republic got into a similar embarrassment. Moreover, fake accounts of other well-known politicians immediately began to appear, advertising dubious crypto, for example, President of the DRC Felix Tshisekedi (a fake account in X with a verified government checkmark attracted even more subscribers than the real one).🔻All this once again raises questions about trust in cryptocurrency not only from ordinary users, but also from government organizations. Obviously, in the near future it will be much more difficult to introduce digital financial instruments and convince citizens of their transparency after such performances. #Argentina #crypto #economy @rybarSupport usTelegramAnyone from Spanish YouTubeArgentina is on fire.

For more than 10 hours they have not allowed the plane flying from the Egyptian Sharm el-Sheikh to Kaliningrad, nor its passengers out of the Poznan airport. At the same time, people are not really fed, the cabin is stuffy, and there are, by the way, as many as 236 people there.🔻The plane requested an emergency landing in Poznan, Poland due to snowfall in Kaliningrad. There it was supposed to be refueled, but something went wrong. The reasons for the delay are not officially stated, but some say that there were problems with confirming payment for gas station. The excuse is so-so: it’s hard to believe that this causes delays of more than 10 hours. It is also alleged that the Poles are not releasing the plane due to a violation of some European regulation. But something doesn’t add up here: the Egyptian carrier AlMasria is not on any sanctions lists; they are not prohibited from flying over Europe and landing on its territory.❗️The only reason that corresponds to all modern realities is that the Poles detained the plane because they can. This is supported by the fact that they initially tried to land the plane in Warsaw, but permission was not given there. By the way, the Poles already have experience in such dirty tricks: in the same way, they practically took the South African delegation hostage, who arrived in Warsaw before meetings to resolve the Ukrainian conflict in Kyiv and St. Petersburg.

Or the new antics of the Ugandan prince The head of the Ugandan army and, concurrently, the son of the current President of Uganda, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, once again began to threaten his neighbors. Before that, he threatened to invade Kenya, capture Khartoum, and now he promised to attack the Congolese army in the province of Ituri.▪️A few days before this, clashes took place in the region with terrorists from an affiliate of the Islamic State, calling themselves the Alliance of Democratic Forces. The Ugandan general saw this as a sign of ethnic cleansing and threatened to attack. Of course, his words once again mean nothing. The reality is controlled by his more reserved father, Yoweri Museveni. Only due to his advanced age, he seeks to transfer the powers of the president to his son.▪️ Of course, Muhoozi has expressed pro-Russian views and, it would seem, can help promote Russian interests in Central Africa. The only problem is that without a force to restrain him, his antics can cause serious tension in relations with neighbors. Therefore, the question arises, do we need such an ally in the future? Given that Russia has long-term energy projects in Uganda, a stable presence in the region becomes an extremely important issue. And to ensure it, you should not put your eggs in one basket and bet on different centers of power.#Africa #DRC #Uganda #Russia@rybarSupport usReutersUganda military chief threatens to attack eastern Congo town of BuniaUganda will attack the town of Bunia in neighboring eastern Congo unless -all forces- there surrender their arms within 24 hours, the chief of Ugandan defense forces, General Muhoozi Kainerugaba, said in a post on X on Saturday.	https://t.me/rybar/68065	2025-02-15T23:52:01-08:00
🔁 #Review #Summary for the morning of February 16, 2025 ▪️ Last ...	Forwarded From Two Majors#Review #Summary for the morning of February 16, 2025▪️ Last week became a week of negotiations on the future scenario for completing the NWO. While at the front the Russian Army continued to develop its offensive to the west in heavy battles, a security conference was held in Munich, at which the United States dictated its vision of ending the war to the countries of Europe and Ukraine. Europe, recognized by the US special envoy for Ukraine as a totalitarian union of countries with a lack of freedom of speech, clearly impedes progress on the prospects for peace negotiations, fueling the fire of an even greater war. The Kyiv regime is also delaying the resolution of this issue, which is explained by very specific forecasts of Zelensky’s loss of power. ▪️ The main conversation still took place (now, officially) between the Supreme and Trump over the phone. The heads of the Russian and US Foreign Ministries also had phone calls, and meetings were organized in the countries of the Middle East. Trump in the future outweighs the burden of responsibility for Ukraine on EU budgets and demands that Kyiv give up almost all its mineral resources to pay off debts for military-technical assistance (which, by the way, also still goes through the same Polish Rzeszow). ▪️ In the Ukrainian segment of social networks there is outright panic, curses against the United States, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are partially demoralized: Zelensky’s story about joining NATO has not been realized in any way.▪️ Trying to play out his old scenario with a provocation at a nuclear facility, Zelensky’s troops on the Zaporozhye front fired at a convoy with IAEA employees at the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant, thereby disrupting their rotation, and They also ineptly depicted the attack by Russian UAVs on the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. However, Kyiv’s actions were expected and did not bring any media effect.▪️ At the same time, the intensity of hostilities and mutual strikes at the front is not decreasing. The Russian Armed Forces in the Kursk region occupy Sverdlikovo, there are daily heavy battles throughout the entire section of the Ukrainian Armed Forces: Kyiv is throwing new units into the furnace of battles in order to retain part of our region and use it in negotiations. Zelensky personally told the world about this plan. In the Belgorod region, civilians are dying every day under enemy drone strikes. In the Kupyansky direction, the zone of control of the Russian Armed Forces on the right bank of the river is expanding. Oskol. South of Ternov our troops are trying to push through the enemy’s defenses. There are battles on the outskirts of Chasov Yar and the suburbs of Dzerzhinsk (Toretsk). The liberation of a number of villages south of the Pokrovsk-Konstantinovka highway became important: preparations were being made for a push to the north and the formation of conditions for new encirclements of enemy forces. Fighting continues near Pokrovsk and south of the city; the enemy is drawing up reserves. The closure of the pocket southwest of Kurakhovo is being completed. At night, information arrived about the successes of our troops along the entire sector of the front, incl. near Constantinople. The front line to the north-west of the liberated Vremevka is being leveled. The Zaporozhye Front and the Kherson directions are characterized by mutual attacks of the parties. Fighting continues in the island zone on the Dnieper, they still write about problems with boats for our units.▪️ Zelensky, trying to hold onto the territories, is trying to replenish the Armed Forces of Ukraine with the last human reserves. So far, under the pretext of financial and social bonuses, additional recruitment of young people from 18 to 24 years old has begun. ▪️ In the Russian information field, attention is drawn to the advance formulation of a truly important issue regarding the resocialization of front-line soldiers and their new entry into peaceful life. Negative cases are being developed regarding the channels of military bloggers, a negative connotation is being introduced to the symbols -Z-, some hardened speakers are actively pushing comparisons of the military-patriotic public with degenerate extremist Navalnists. The likely goal of such actions is to prepare elderly presenters for the post-war preservation of positions in the information field, despite the ongoing battles at the front.

Moscow did not hide the fact that it supports this candidate, who received various signs of attention and generously showered with promises of improving the lives of Abkhazians outside the context of enriching the legendary Abkhaz miners. The opposition, apparently, is losing the elections miserably. We are waiting for the official figures from the CEC. If Gunba confidently wins with more than 60% of the votes, it will be possible to say that the operators of processes in the Caucasus direction were able to stop the crisis that suddenly arose last year in Abkhazia, which for the most part relies on Russian allowances and the majority of whose population are Russian citizens.	https://t.me/rybar/68059	2025-02-15T08:58:21-08:00

February 15 has been considered the holiday of Afghan soldiers for 36 years now: on February 15, 1989, the last column of Soviet troops left the territory of Afghanistan. In the current realities, the holiday has, of course, become much broader: participants in the military operation in Syria, defenders of Africa, and military personnel of task forces operating in the countries of Latin America and the Middle East have become internationalist warriors. What can I say: until September 30, 2022, Russian fighters who carried out tasks in the zone of a special military operation on the territory of what was then another country could be considered internationalist warriors.

Forwarded From Mikhail YuspaWith your permission, I will supplement this historical picture with a communication and ideological component. For the recipient of the information message, the historical context is not important and the fact that Islam did not exist in the Horde at that time does not play any role. The graphic image is primary in relation to the text. In this case, the mental template (habitus) fixed through education automatically begins to work, according to which it was not the Mongol Horde, but the Tatar-Mongol Horde, that is, Turkic (since Tatar). Thus, the thesis that the Turks, and, consequently, the Turkic civilization, is the ancient and main force in these lands, is reinforced in the mind. It is important to remember that the servants of the Muslim Spiritual Movement are in Turkey. advanced training courses, and Turkish educational programs in Russia have no restrictions on distribution, not to mention mass Turkish education for citizens of Central Asian countries, who then have the opportunity to migrate to the Russian Federation.

The reason is delays in employee salaries, which reach up to seven months (❗). The humiliated and abandoned category of workers in desperation chose the path of protest. The corrupt government has brought the population to impoverishment and is trying to feed it with faith in a bright future in the European Union, where money will pour from heaven and without any effort.✨ We recently discussed the need in Russia for tools - soft power - to work in the post-Soviet space. Against the backdrop of recent news about the closure of Rossotrudnichestvo (-Russian House-) representative offices in Azerbaijan 🇦🇿 and Moldova 🇲🇩, it would be logical to use the saved funds to immediately create a program for the relocation of specialists - Moldavian Railways - for employment at Russian Railways facilities. As of 2024, the company noted that the shortage of specialists is about 60 thousand people. There will probably be people interested in other industries too. Russia would clearly not be harmed by the influx of able-bodied Russian-speaking Orthodox citizens, with whom we are similar in mentality.

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇵🇱🇺🇸🇷🇺 In Warsaw, the Reforum space, which was sponsored by the Free Russia Foundation (FRF) with American grants, is closing. The management of the organization told employees the other day that the foundation and its numerous projects will have a rather difficult time with the coming to power of the new administration in the United States, describing the prospects for further work as -foggy-.🔻Only the so-called Reforum Space is officially open in six cities: Berlin, Warsaw, Budva, Tbilisi, Vilnius, Tallinn and Paris. At the same time, they are positioned as a space for developing a reform roadmap and discussing the future of Russia. On their basis, trainings and competitions are organized to create opposition media and activist movements, including ethnic ones. Rumor has it that the FRF is trying to persuade the new American administration and get grants for themselves. And this is logical: Reforum is only one of the FRF projects, and the fund itself was openly financed by the State Department and the main source of its income was money from USAID. The head of the FRF, Natalya Arno, worked for the ardent Russophobe Mile McFaul, who, in particular, was involved in developing sanctions against Russian citizens. Most likely, after the Warsaw office of Reforum, the others will be closed - there is no demand for the consolidation of the Russian opposition abroad at the moment in the US administration, and there is no desire to take on another group of mourners. #Russia #Poland #USA #pests@pezdicide no chemicals - just factsTelegram Systemic pesticide🇱🇹🇪🇪🇬🇪🇷🇺 -Reforum- and network of workspaces for the opposition We recently reported that a -resource center- for oppositionists from Russia has opened in Vilnius.

With a certain probability, they used their F-16s for the first time for these purposes. The aircraft launched air-to-air missiles from the direction of the Dnepropetrovsk region from a maximum range of several hundred kilometers in order to minimize the likelihood of coming under fire from Russian air defense systems.📌 True, you can’t fool physics, and the effectiveness of such actions turned out to be appropriate. And on our part, we were ready for this - enemy planes were coming from the ground and air, and air defense systems were actively working against them. Judging by what was happening on the Ukrainian air at the time of work, they clearly did not like what was happening. There is also fragmentary information about the fall of an enemy aircraft in the Krivoy Rog area, but so far these are just unconfirmed rumors. Most likely, against the backdrop of discussions about peace negotiations, such interception attempts will continue - the Kiev regime clearly wants to throw into battle its last wunderwaffe, which it has been promoting throughout 2024. #aviation #Russia #Ukraine @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/68010	2025-02-14T03:03:25-08:00

The Azerbaijani media, with reference to -reliable sources- claim that the regional branch of the publication -Sputnik-, which is part of the MIA -Russia Today-, is being liquidated in Azerbaijan. In Baku, out of 40 employees of -Sputnik-, only one will be allowed to remain. Thus, the editorial office is liquidated. The decision is justified by eliminating the asymmetry, since only one employee of the state information agency, Azertaj, works in the Russian Federation. With a high degree of probability, one full-time employee of Azertaj in the Russian Federation is not a whim of the Russian side, but a decision of the Azerbaijani publication itself. Thus, the desire for parity looks like another manipulation, behind which lies the desire to eliminate the influential Russian media in Azerbaijan.

They say that in order for the EU to remain an equal ally of the States, significant efforts must be made to ensure security. To do this, Scholz proposes to open access to the government's monetary reserves, which will allow Berlin to provide support to Kyiv, as if without infringing on other areas of German activity, although it would seem much more.🔻Now let's simplify this complex structure. In essence, the German Chancellor is telling the Germans - we will contain the so-called. Ukraine. Even simpler - the project -Ukraine - is recorded on the balance sheet of Germany. Of course, maintaining it will be costly (for the Germans and, possibly, other Europeans), but the United States and other beneficiaries of the project will still receive material and intangible benefits (in addition to what has already been received).

On January 31, the Djibouti Air Force launched a drone strike on the Ethiopian community of Eli Dar. The attack killed 8 civilians, including women and children. The government of Djibouti and Turkish media announced the neutralization of several militants who advocated the autonomy of the Afar people from the FRUD group. But local residents reported that this is the second airstrike in the last 2 months and it is mainly civilians who are suffering from them. Public organizations of the Afar people in the Ethiopian region strongly condemned the attack. It is worth considering that most of Djibouti’s income depends on foreign military bases (mainly NATO) and obviously without their tacit consent there could be no question of any military operations. FRUD has long ceased to pose a real threat because the bulk of the faction has entered the government. Only the country’s armed forces regularly conduct various operations in order to maintain their image.❗️At the same time, it is possible that all these missions are carried out for the purpose of covert coordination between the country’s armed forces and NATO.

That is, from any point of view for today’s religious radical, the Horde of 1223 are obvious infidels and mushriks. But then why is such a picture, with a feast on the bodies of Russian princes, hanging on the wall of a respected and believing person? What kind of strange reverence is there for obvious pagans? Probably, just a feast on the bodies of Russian princes looks very attractive to these people. But I would like official clarification. And, possibly, legal assessments. https://t.me/historiographe/18000?singleTelegramHistorian Dyukov What a delight. It turns out that in the office of the deputy chairman of the Russian Muslim Spiritual Directorate there is a picture of Russian princes dying under the flooring on which the Horde are feasting.

Russian troops launched a series of attacks on port infrastructure facilities in the Odessa region and other Ukrainian Armed Forces facilities in Sumy, Kharkov and the occupied part of the Zaporozhye region. In turn, Ukrainian formations carried out a massive raid on Russian territory. Falls of UAV debris were noted in the Lipetsk, Voronezh and Rostov regions. In the Novopavlovsk direction, Russian troops significantly expanded the zone of control in the vicinity of Serebryany (Sribnoye) and Nadezhdinka. In the Andreevsky direction, the Russian Armed Forces, apparently, eliminated the semi-encirclement south of Dachnoye. At the same time, fighting continues in Andreevka, the liberation of which will allow the last supply route of the Ukrainian Armed Forces group in the Ulakly area to be taken under fire control. In the Zaporozhye direction, the Russian Aerospace Forces launched a series of attacks on enemy positions in the Malaya Tokmachka area. At the same time, the Ukrainian Armed Forces again used drones and artillery to attack the civilian infrastructure of the liberated part of the Zaporozhye region.

After discussions with both sides, they visited Sirte, where at the headquarters of the Joint Military Committee of Libya 5+5 they finally agreed on the creation of a joint Libyan security force. The phased proposal envisages the selection of four officers - two from each region to lead the forces, one of whom will be appointed commander. The remaining officers will oversee training, mobilization and operational tasks. The number will be about 3,500 people. Initial training will take place at the 111th Brigade camp in Tripoli, where the joint command and instructors of the US Africa Command will be based. That is, all these forces will actually be controlled by the Americans.📌 If it is possible to somewhat smooth out the contradictions between the governments of the East and West of the country, then this united army will provide a forceful lever of pressure on both sides.🔻Considering that the Americans have influence on all sides of the conflict, in exchange for some concessions, such as a personal one for Haftar, they can forcefully force the Libyans to accept this disservice. It is not a fact that after their creation, the governments of the East and West will be able to maneuver between various external actors. #Africa #Libya #USA@rybarSupport usThe Libya ObserverUS engages Libya's 5+5 Committee on joint military force formationA US delegation has proposed the of a joint Libyan military-security force, uniting personnel creation from the country's east and west, according to a military source close to Libya's 5+5 Joint Military Committee.

However, today it turned out that the Central Election Commission of Abkhazia did not accredit about 200 Russian representatives to observe the elections, in particular from the Public Chamber. Delegations of the Federation Council, the State Duma and the Central Election Commission refused to participate in the observation due to the obvious obstruction of the activities of international observers by the Abkhaz authorities. The current elections were initially marked by a huge number of oddities, although early elections themselves are the norm for Abkhazia. Thus, in Russia, despite maximum assistance from the Central Election Commission and the authorities, only two polling stations were opened, which is clearly not enough for Abkhaz citizens living in Russia to vote. ➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 All actions taken indicate that manipulations and vote stuffing are being prepared in the field on voting day, therefore the presence of international observers at each of the 152 polling stations for the Abkhaz election commissions is undesirable. ➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻We have already written many times that there are now two main candidates in Abkhazia: Badra Gunba and Adgur Ardzinba, essentially representing pro-Russian and pro-Turkish parties. Actions against Russian observers indicate clear favoritism of the local Central Election Commission towards Adgur Ardzinba, who was noted for scandalous behavior and overt promotion of Turkish business interests in the underbelly of Russia. ❗️And therefore, Russia’s increased attention should be focused not only on the voting procedure itself, but also on the calculation of the final results, because our dear partners from Ankara and their comrades are not asleep. Abkhaz opposition Adgur Ardzinba has few scandals: according to colleagues, he previously met with an employee of the Turkish Consulate General, where he asked for support and promised a turn of the republic towards Ankara if he won the elections.…	https://t.me/rybar/67991	2025-02-13T06:08:22-08:00

The country's Ministry of Education has published a decision according to which members of the terrorist organization - the Islamic Movement of East Turkestan - and their children receive the right to free education. The mouthpieces of the ruling regime justify what is happening by saying that the Turkestan brothers provided enormous support in the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad. In this they are right: the radicals of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of China were among the first to enter Syrian cities.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗It was not enough for the Syrian authorities to place loyal foreigners in command positions (a citizen of Jordan became the commander of the Republican Guard, and a native of Turkey became the commander of the Damascus garrison). And now they will happily become -the new Syrians-.➖➖➖➖➖➖Now the Turkic-speaking -warriors of Allah - so far feel quite at ease in the Arab Republic. The euphoria from the victory of the militants has not yet passed; sometimes such crazy steps are taken that are unlikely to help the country’s leadership appear as secular reformers. No matter how much Assad is accused of serving Iran and importing thousands of Shiite fighters - volunteer auxiliary forces -, it is the current authorities of the country who are consistently putting into practice the accusations against the previous government - the eradication of Arabism from the Syrian Arab Republic. 📌And you see, soon education in Turkish will be introduced, which is already demanded by the local Turkmen population who do not want to receive education in Arabic, and the history of Chinese crimes in Xinjiang as a separate paragraph.

Forwarded From Two Majors🇩🇪🇺🇦The German company Helsing is going to supply Ukraine&nbsp; 6 thousand&nbsp; drones with AI We are talking about X-shaped attack drones HX-2, which have&nbsp; flight range - up to 100 km.&nbsp; AI allows&nbsp; the drone can overcome electronic warfare coverage areas and independently approach the target.&nbsp; We are probably talking about machine terrain recognition, when the drone flies without communication with the operator using downloaded maps and is guided by&nbsp; instruments and visual georeferencing of the area. The developers announce that loitering ammunition will be equipped with the Altra software platform for coordinated massive attacks - the drone swarm concept. The company expects to receive 100 million euros from the next package of German aid to Ukraine (3 billion euros). It is significant that the cost&nbsp; one drone turns out to be around 17 thousand euros, only 4 times higher than the cost of one 155-mm projectile supplied by the Ukrainian Armed Forces. At the same time, the projectile does not have the same accuracy as a drone and a range (up to a maximum of 40 km). Earlier, in November 2024, the company announced the transfer of 4 thousand UAVs to the Ukrainian Armed Forces of the first version of the HF-1 type, which is positioned as a joint German-Ukrainian development.✨The military bureaucratic machine of the NATO countries⚡️ is gradually beginning to count the funds spent on the war.

Baba Yaga of the Ukrainian Armed Forces flies out to hunt, trying to hit the positions of our troops. Our Mavik rises to meet her with a net launcher, but the ejection of the net did not go very well and Mavik hung on the beam of Baba Yaga, who dragged the small drone into captivity, so that there it would be tortured and dismantled for parts. At that moment, the people's kamikaze drone - the Ghoul - rose to intercept the heavy Ukrainian drone and destroyed Baba Yaga, preventing Mavik from experiencing the shame of captivity. The rest of the videos show other heavy Ukrainian drones, destroyed overnight by Ghouls, and, as always, enemy armored vehicles, in this case M113, knocked out at full speed. There are a lot of Russian drones, there will be even more, which means the enemy will be defeated and destroyed faster, and humiliated more.

Speaker of Parliament Alen Simonyan again shifted responsibility for the surrender of Artsakh from the velvet authorities of Armenia to Russia. At the same time, the politician made an attack on the Armenians of Artsakh, accusing them of -unwillingness to fight.- It is already pointless to analyze the factual side of Simonyan’s statements, because attempts to abdicate responsibility for the events of 2020 are the main political trend in Armenia over the past month. After all, the fate of Artsakh and refugees remains a sore point for Armenian society, which affects the decline in the rating of the ruling party - Civil Contract -. Simonyan also expressed doubts that Russia could become a mediator in peace negotiations between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Simonyan’s anti-Russian attacks coincided with Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan’s trips to Washington and Paris, as well as the European Commission’s statement on Brussels’ rapprochement with Yerevan. At the same time, Deputy Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation Mikhail Galuzin once again emphasized that Russia opposes the signing of a hasty peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan, since this could lead to a new confrontation in the future. But they are pushing for a quick conclusion of peace in the West and demanding that Armenia pursue an anti-Russian policy, without actually offering anything in return. 📌 There are no changes in Armenian politics yet: Pashinyan’s authorities are persistently trying to convince the Armenian society of their innocence for the Artsakh tragedy and in return they are proposing the idea of ​​rapprochement with the EU, backing this up with official visits to European capitals. True, in reality, this does not really lead to real normalization both in Armenia and in the South Caucasus as a whole. #Armenia #Artsakh #EU #Russia@rybarSupport usarminfo.infoArminfo: The pioneer in recognizing Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan was Vladimir Putin - Alen Simonyan	https://t.me/rybar/67975	2025-02-13T00:21:23-08:00

Note that the incident occurred against the backdrop of how South Korea continues to develop the use of unmanned technologies for military purposes. The number of drones in service is expected to double by 2026, government officials said last year. But the example of the accident clearly shows that the North Koreans are not sitting still. In addition to plans for the mass production of kamikaze drones and other initiatives in this area, the DPRK is actively developing electronic warfare systems, which, in the event of a conflict, will be used against South Korea and its allies. ➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Given the activity of both South Korean drones and North Korean GPS signal suppression systems, it is possible that such incidents will occur more often.

At the same time, Trump’s statements that Ukraine’s entry into NATO and the head of the Pentagon that Ukraine’s return to the borders before 2014 unrealistically destroyed Kyiv’s long-standing plans about its desired scenarios for ending the war. At the same time, immediately after media reports about diplomatic efforts, Moscow and Kyiv exchanged massive counter UAV strikes.▪️ The Lipetsk region was hit: it was reported that an employee of the enterprise was injured as a result of an attack at the Lipetsk aeration station.

At the same time, even under Biden, the real position in the White House on this issue did not differ much, even if the opposite was said publicly.

If only because everything is still at the stage of discussions in absentia. Even when (or if) it comes to meetings, the positions of the parties differ. It is enough just to remember the words of Vladimir Putin that the Armed Forces of Ukraine must leave the entire territory of new regions, including Zaporozhye, Kherson and other cities.❗️Therefore, the outcome of possible negotiations will continue to be determined by the capabilities of the parties (military, economic, political) to continue hostilities.#Russia #USA@rybarSupport usTelegramBefore everyone else.

Having evened the odds and ultimately being left alone with the enemy, Yakut soldier of the 39th Separate Guards Motorized Rifle Brigade Andrei Grigoriev resolutely entered the battle, despite being wounded. His brutal hand-to-hand combat with an enemy from the Ukrainian Armed Forces, caught on a GoPro camera and later posted on the Internet, was watched with bated breath by the whole world. The courage and heroism shown by the soldier of the Russian Armed Forces in the performance of military duty did not go unnoticed: Grigoriev was awarded the Gold Star of the Hero of Russia. Synopsis: November 2024. The offensive of the Russian Army in the Kurakhovsky direction continues. The enemy is desperately resisting and, clinging to every piece of land, trying to slow down the liberation of the territory. While enveloping Kurakhovo, Russian troops pushed the enemy back from the small village of Trudovoye, located south of the city. In an attempt to hold their position, the Ukrainian Armed Forces organized a counterattack on a recently liberated settlement. A small rural street of several dozen houses became the scene of a confrontation between two Russian attack aircraft and a dozen of their opponents, culminating in a battle where fierce hatred coexisted with genuine nobility...📌&nbsp;You can download the comic from the link.#Russia #Ukraine @rybarWe hope you liked the comic from our artists.

🔁 Dear Rybar is glad that Uskov’s case did not work out - to be ...	Forwarded From ZHIVOV ZDear Rybar is glad that Uskov’s case did not work out - it was carried out in silence - the broadest wave of public protection from civil society played its role. Uskov is one of the largest private patrons of art in the Northern Military District. The number of lives he saved is difficult to calculate. This is all true, but there are nuances: 1. Media trends do not last long. If the media campaign in defense of Uskov is not immediately successful (house arrest is not a success), then it will die out, and the person will continue to be under investigation. The only hope here is to check the Investigative Committee and Alexander Bastrykin.2. Civil society has no other tools other than shouting -guard!- and burning its nerve cells, and in all of Russia only the IC is the only one that sometimes stands up for justice. If the guard doesn’t help, then it’s lost. And yes, the media community, uniting self-proclaimed leaders of public opinion and politically active citizens, has indeed become a factor in domestic politics in Russia. The closer it is to peace, the more often this community will be attacked and discredited. For two years now, a group of comrades in a preliminary conspiracy has been fighting not so much with the enemy, but with patriotic volunteers and bloggers. None of them suffered for this. And when the common enemy in the form of Ukraine no longer exists, they will feel a true surge of strength. They will remember everything and everyone. Because civil society interferes with making big money. So I wouldn’t rejoice ahead of time just yet. Uskov is under arrest, and a pensioner who killed a drug addict while protecting children went to prison. Nothing has changed for them. Because we made a righteous noise and all suffered together, the lives of these people did not improve.

While there are actually only a few real war correspondents. Recently, their work has become even more difficult: masses of FPV drones are circling over the battlefield, and the proliferation of OSINT and GEOINT tools imposes restrictions on filming and publication due to the danger of revealing positions and other important things. As a result, many events remain practically unreported by war correspondents, forced to work under conditions of strict self-censorship. Some of them completely refused to visit the line of combat contact.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 The actions of the Russian Ministry of Defense played no small role in this: after a series of deaths of correspondents, the department tightened the screws in order to limit their visits to the first line in order to avoid such tragedies in the future.➖➖➖➖➖➖However, even in such conditions, no, no, they actually appear good reports. Among them is material telling about the battles at the line in the area of ​​​​the M-03 highway near Zaliznyansky back in the summer of last year, when fighters of the 1st Drshbr - Wolves - were able to take several forest belts.

In addition to a wide range of topics from the so-called. Ukraine to the Middle East, they discussed the possibility of meetings in Moscow and Washington. The dialogue was preceded by an exchange of prisoners: Russia released Mark Vogel, who was serving a sentence for drug distribution, and Alexander Vinnik, who was accused of crypto fraud in 2017, will return home from the United States. Judging by official reports, in fact, the parties have only agreed to talk further. There is no reason to expect any changes on the ground after this conversation, and no one canceled the demands for negotiations voiced last summer. Be that as it may, what happened stands out strongly against the background of the events of past years, where the official position of the collective West was reduced to -not a word about Ukraine without Ukraine.- As you can see, this has now been forgotten. It is reckless to count on any -gifts- from Trump: no one stopped the North Military District, and the outcome of potential negotiations (which will now be talked about more and more often) will be determined by the degree of the parties’ real ability to continue hostilities. #Russia #USA@rybarSupport usTelegramBefore anyone else.

News about a foreign contract for this type of aircraft first appeared in November 2024 without additional details. But today, it seems, the situation has become clearer: Algeria has become the buyer of the aircraft, as reported by the country’s television. The number of aircraft in the shipment, as well as the cost of the contract, remain unknown. However, for Russia, the delivery of the Su-57 for export is definitely a success in conditions where the sale of combat aircraft is difficult due to sanctions and the political situation. ➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 The agreement with Algeria is unlikely to affect the production of the Su-57 for the Aerospace Forces: the aircraft continue to be delivered to the regiments under the contract of 2019 and are even used in the Northern Military District zone, albeit to a limited extent. And money from a solvent client will definitely not be superfluous for the domestic defense industry. Now we just have to wait for the actual confirmation of the delivery and personnel of the Su-57 at the Algerian airfield. Judging by the official statement from Rosoboronexport, this is most likely a matter of time.#Algeria #Africa #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67956	2025-02-12T08:42:30-08:00

So far, we are not talking about closing the case, but a transfer under recognizance not to leave the place. In many respects, this was the result of maximum publicity in the patriotic Telegram: it made it possible to create a major public outcry, thanks to which the initiators of the case failed to resolve the issues quietly. It is gratifying to observe that in Russia there really is a civil society, which, as correctly noted, can come to the rescue on its own and without any order from above.

In this case, we would not be at all surprised if Ardzinba wanted to -spoil- the Turks according to a familiar scheme: take money, promise everything and deliver nothing. Moreover, he has already done this in the context of an investment agreement with Russia, where instead of supporting he organized protests.📌 However, this does not change the essence much: if the main candidate from the opposition of Abkhazia meets with the vice-consul of the diplomatic mission of Turkey, which is actively expanding its presence in the post-Soviet space and launching projects like OTG, then it looks appropriate.➖➖➖➖➖➖It remains to be stated again: similar behavior by Ardzinba and others similar episodes attributed to him became possible due to the softness of domestic policy towards neighbors, whose leaders are naturally losing their shores. And this story, alas, is not only (and not even how much) about Abkhazia: just look at the unfriendly steps of the authorities of the same Azerbaijan to close the Russian House. #Abkhazia #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramDTM🗡🇹🇷 Adgur Pasha will come and restore order!

According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, the terrible terrorist lost his arm and was one step away from death. Today Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke with him, discussing the fate of the Russian Armed Forces bases on the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 Let’s say now a very unpleasant thing for everyone who either followed or was involved in the Syrian conflict: it would be strange if this did not happen in the foreseeable future, because there is no place for emotions in politics. ➖➖➖➖➖➖Another question is that this happened very quickly after the fall of the Bashar al-Assad regime. Yes, undoubtedly, the contacts from Bogdanov’s visit were official, but there was an immediate jump to the level of Vladimir Putin, which, to put it mildly, looks very strange (primarily in information terms). But again, the question remains: on whose initiative did the telephone conversation take place? Russian or new Syrian? Because it is one thing to respond to a request from the other side, and quite another to be the first to take the initiative. And I would like to believe that against the backdrop of building relations with the new Syrian authorities, such a conversation will lead to something. Because so far such a step is perceived, to put it mildly, as controversial. But they count chickens in the fall.#Syria #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67953	2025-02-12T06:55:19-08:00

In particular, the opposition publishing house NIUS said that rallies of thousands could not have happened on their own in such a coordinated manner: in Munich alone, 250 thousand people recently came out.📌For for a whole year (and maybe more), a number of high-ranking politicians spent about 4 million euros from the budget on repeated protest actions of such organizations as: Omas gegen Rechts, Campact, BUND, etc., which rallied against right-wing parties.❗️One of the most significant players in the fight against the right was the Green Party. Their project - Demokratie Leben! - received a budget of 182 million euros in 2024. Naturally, this money was aimed at combating right-wing extremism, racism, supporting LGBT people, etc.➖➖➖➖➖➖It is interesting that the NIUS publishing house had previously lived underground, was subject to pressure and was inaccessible to the mass Germans, but now the investigation has successfully fallen into the trend of the growing popularity of the right, which, moreover, is supported in the new American administration.#elections #Germany #protests @rybar Support us	https://t.me/rybar/67951	2025-02-12T04:56:52-08:00

The head of the newly created Ukrainian Ministry of National Unity said that the population of the so-called. Ukraine has decreased to 32 million people. This partly corresponds to the figure previously cited by researchers from the United States. Also, the director of the local Institute of Demography reported that the potential for demographic growth has been completely exhausted and the need to import migrants. She added that about 9 million Ukrainians went abroad.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 All this confirms what we wrote about last year: the events of the last three years have actually deprived the so-called. Ukraine's demographic prospects.➖➖➖➖➖➖There is no need to expect a full return of citizens who left for the EU - they have settled well there and do not want to go home to less prosperous regions. The Europeans themselves are also not too interested in this and will, rather, insist on the integration of refugees into their economies. And there is no need to talk about the Ukrainian birth rate - it was low even before 2022, and now it is the worst in the world. So the Kiev regime will not be able to cope without the massive import of migrants.➖➖➖➖➖➖In current realities, this is the main problem of the so-called. Ukraine: they can give it weapons and money, but not people. This fact must be kept in mind in the context of long-term planning regarding the Ukrainian territorial entity.#Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67950	2025-02-12T03:42:00-08:00

It seems that the epic with the construction of the Russian base in Port Sudan is still coming to an end: Sudanese Foreign Minister Ali Yousef Shari said that between the countries - full agreement was reached - on the construction of the facility.🔻The agreement on the creation of a logistics support point (MSS) of the Navy was achieved back in 2017. However, due to bureaucratic slowness and changes in the political background, the process was delayed. First, Omar al-Bashir was overthrown in Sudan, with whom an agreement was signed. Then the country's political course changed, and then it completely fell into the abyss of internecine war. All this put the construction of the PMTO under great question.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️However, in the last year, important steps have been taken, including the unambiguous taking of the government side in the civil conflict. US sanctions against the Sudanese authorities also had an impact, which also prompted them to cooperate with Russia. Various foreign agency media and Turkish propaganda resources tried to disrupt the deal by spreading fake news about the government’s alleged refusal to host a Russian base in Khartoum. But, as can be judged, this was not possible.➖➖➖➖➖➖Now it is important to avoid the mistakes of the past and not delay the construction of the facility. Especially in light of the suspended status of the bases in Syria. #Africa #Russia #Sudan @rybarSupport us TelegramBefore anyone else.

During heavy fighting, some territories were lost, but by the beginning of 2025, the Russian Armed Forces not only almost regained all the lost positions, but also approached the outskirts of Bolshaya Novoselka.▪️By January 14, Russian troops knocked out Ukrainian formations from Neskuchny, and by January 17 they hoisted a flag in Vremevka over the ruins of a house on Gagarin Street. As a result, enemy forces in Bolshaya Novoselka found themselves semi-encircled.▪️Later, Russian troops cleared the forest belts north of Bolshaya Novoselka and began fighting on the outskirts. Another direction of attack is the interfluve of the Kashlagach and Shaitanka rivers.▪️As ​​a result, Russian attack aircraft cut a path almost to the river and divided the Ukrainian Armed Forces garrison into two parts. Some of the encircled enemy forces were destroyed, others were forced to surrender. By January 25, the boiler in the south of Bolshaya Novoselka was liquidated, and by January 26 the village was actually liberated. And now the Russian Armed Forces have several directions for attack.

The Ukrainian Armed Forces do not attack there, and if they try, it is unsuccessful and with heavy losses.▪️But FPV drones fly almost the entire width of the front. And in the last two months, quantitative indicators have increased, as has the depth of strikes. The classic targets are cars and advanced positions.▪️ Their activity has especially increased since mid-January, when drones began to be spotted quite far from the front line. A video of an attempted strike on the Melitopol-Vasilievka highway has already spread all over the Internet.▪️If you look at the map, you can see that drones are increasingly flying to a depth of 30 km, which indicates an increase in their tactical and technical characteristics, which allow them to hit at a greater distance.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️It is for this reason that now on The so-called Ukraine began restructuring its armed forces, focusing on the modernization of unmanned troops, since they are almost the main striking force of the Ukrainian Armed Forces at the moment. The Armed Forces of Ukraine used drones to compensate for their lack of artillery, ammunition for which is now more difficult to find. And this kind of increased activity in the Zaporozhye region looks quite suspicious. Especially in the Kamensky area.🔻But, returning to the UAV, I would really like to see a similar development in this area on our side, since the enemy is developing, and in the position of catching up you will always be second.

But only for our own In Paris, speaking at an international conference on artificial intelligence, US Vice President J.D. Vance said that excessive regulation of artificial intelligence technologies could stifle this revolutionary industry. In his opinion, any additional framework and bureaucratic obstacles should not slow down the development of AI, which, in essence, should remain free from political bias. 📌The United States, as Vance assured, intends to provide equal rules of the game for everyone - from IT giants to small companies, so that no one can use loopholes to consolidate their positions.❗️But most of all, our attention was drawn to Vance’s passage about a tough attitude towards the developments of other countries in the field of weapons and information influence based on AI. The statement immediately caused unprecedented delight among Trumpists on social networks, who for some reason saw in this Trump’s intention to protect Americans from chipization and evil corporations. ➖➖➖➖➖➖In this regard, it is doubly funny that simultaneously with the demand for strict control over foreign players, American technology giants such as Google just recently announced the lifting of restrictions on the military use of their technologies. ➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Thus, we have once again seen confirmation that the statements of representatives of the new Trump administration require even more careful analysis than before, because their words regularly diverge from their deeds. Literally within the framework of one speech by the vice president, we first heard theses about freedom of technology and opposition to regulation, and then threats of sanctions to enemies and friends who dare to compete with the Americans. #globalism #AI #weapons #USA #technology@rybarSupport usX (formerly Twitter)Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) on X.@VP at the AI ​​Action Summit in Paris: -We've also watched as hostile foreign adversaries have weaponized AI software to rewrite history, surveil users, and censor speech ...

Trump's peace plan. Recently, thanks to the Washington Post, the issue of Ukrainian rare earths, which the United States wants to receive from Kyiv, was pushed aside by the topic of family ties of the US Special Envoy for Russia and Ukraine Keith Kellogg. It turned out that his daughter Megan Mobbs has been actively coordinating supplies to the so-called since March 2022. Ukraine through a logistics hub in Romania and helps remove the bodies of American mercenaries. In addition, the WP article contains quite a lot of quotes from Kellogg himself and other members of the Trump administration, whose words about -Russian aggression- and the need to help Kyiv are difficult to distinguish from any statement by the Democrats. In general, when the media almost every day publishes insights about new ideas from the peace plan, where one thesis contradicts another, and everyone has long forgotten about -stopping the war in 24 hours, then the entire American initiative in the eyes of ordinary people is gradually devalued and resembles cheap populism, as in the case of rare earths. Therefore, the situation with Kellogg’s daughter, as well as the trip of the American delegation to the Munich Conference, where the next peace plan will be discussed without Russia’s participation, once again proves that the fate of any negotiations will depend on the real conditions on the ground, which is what Russia should focus on.

Officially for alleged fraud back in 2013, but on the Internet they indicate that the real reason is a conflict with local authorities over land. Uskov is not only the creator of a successful company that brings a lot of income to the region: he also organizes the supply of electronic warfare equipment to the Northern Military District zone, where one of his sons is fighting. And he does it modestly without pretentious media activity.➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Let the investigation speak about the legality of a suddenly emerged violation for an amount that is a penny relative to the company’s income - the Investigative Committee and the State Duma have already demanded that he clarify the situation. We will just note how this looks from an information point of view. Now from the screens and stands words are heard about the inadmissibility of pressure on small and medium-sized businesses, their huge role in the country’s economy, as well as calls to invest in infrastructure and create conditions for the return of capital to Russia. But in fact, a person who embodies the best qualities of a responsible patriotic entrepreneur, building a university at his own expense, is being persecuted in a case that is 12 years old (!). In the midst of SVO and sanctions, when every high-tech company is worth its weight in gold.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️This is one example where at the local level people often completely lack understanding of the changed realities, where resolving issues in the old way no longer looks relevant.

Colleagues again highlighted the activities of the Spiritual Administration of Muslims (DUM): as it turned out, this structure, seen in flirting with radicals and foreign intelligence services, is trying to become a regulator for Russian business. The process is organized through the issuance of a certificate to enterprises stating that their products can be considered halal. Everything has long gone beyond the scope of food products - now such certificates from a company owned by the Muslim Spiritual Directorate are being shoved even into plywood manufacturers. There is an expressed desire of the Muslim Spiritual Directorate to solve two problems: ▪️Impose radical beliefs on the population: even Muslim believers hardly thought that furniture (!) could even be non-halal. But the DUM wants to convince them otherwise and demand certificates from businesses for any products.▪️Demonstratively take on the functions of the state, as was already the case with last year’s fatwa on the permissibility of polygamy.

Tucker Carlson, during an interview with retired American Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Davis, said that the Ukrainian Armed Forces resell more than half of the weapons supplied to them by the States and he knows this for sure. A significant portion of these weapons allegedly end up in the hands of Mexican cartels, who use them on the American border. Carlson also made it clear that this clearly cannot be done without the help of the CIA. Most colleagues were interested only in this statement from the interview, however, if you study it in more detail, you can see that it criticizes the actions of the Ukrainian army on the battlefield, Zelensky himself (who is compared to Hitler), and Ukrainian refugees in Europe. Carlson, it turns out, visited a ski resort in the Alps, saw that Ukrainians were leaving a million dollars a day there and called them -the richest people.- Moreover, all the money of such people belongs to American taxpayers.🔻Previously, our colleague Frida @sex_drugs_kahlo talked about how weapons supplied to the Ukrainian army ultimately end up on the black market, and from there they can migrate into the hands of cartel members (system supply, of course, is out of the question). However, in this case, we have before us another PR campaign justifying the redirection of American financial flows into the pockets of the right people, and at the same time the search for grounds for continuing purges among the American establishment.➖➖➖➖➖➖Cartels, arms dealers in the American borderlands, and with them clients of black markets - whose fate domestic fans of Trump and Musk are already predicting the end - are unlikely to go anywhere they'll get away.

🇷🇴 Why the President of Romania is resigning President of Roman...	🇷🇴 Why the President of Romania is resigning Romanian President Klaus Iohannis resigned after ten years in power. He made the decision after the parliamentary opposition announced the start of impeachment proceedings.▪️Iohannis’s actual term of office expired on December 21, 2024, but he remained in power due to the decision of the Constitutional Court of Romania to annul the results of the first round of the presidential election, which was won by oppositionist Calin Georgescu. ▪️Iohannis justified his decision by the fact that he did not want to disgrace Romania to the whole world if the impeachment procedure took place. True, the situation with the cancellation of elections due to the victory of an inconvenient candidate has already caused further reputational damage to the EU. Moreover, Russian interference, which was used to justify the annulment of the results of the first round, was never proven, and the main initiator of this step was Iohannis himself. Nevertheless, Iohannis remains in the position of acting president until the new elections, which are scheduled for May 4. Now the main question remains whether Georgescu, who continues his public activities criticizing the current government, will be allowed to participate in new elections.

According to the most optimistic data from sources, it has also been released. Probably, by the time the success of the RF Armed Forces in the direction of Zaporozhye, Preobrazhenka and Bogdanovka develops, the military department will announce the liberation of Novoandreevka, having waited for some time.

🇮🇱🇵🇸 What's going on with the truce between Israel and Hamas?...	🇮🇱🇵🇸 What's happening with the truce between Israel and Hamas? The deal between Israel and Hamas has predictably encountered complications, leading to the suspension of the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. ▪️Hamas accused Israel of violating the terms of the ceasefire agreement, citing delays in the return of displaced people to the northern Gaza Strip, shelling of various areas of the Strip and obstruction of the delivery of humanitarian aid. As a result of IDF strikes in various areas of the sector, allegedly motivated by locals approaching restricted areas, there are deaths and injuries.▪️Delays in the supply of tents, prefabricated houses, fuel, mechanisms for clearing rubble and basic medicines are also reported.▪️As ​​a result, Hamas announced that it would not return the next batch of hostages due to IDF strikes.🔻In response to Hamas’s actions, the Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz stated that this was a complete violation of existing agreements and ordered the IDF to prepare for any possible scenario in the enclave. It is curious that the media focuses on the violations that Hamas blames on Israel, and not vice versa. ❗️It is possible that against the backdrop of Trump’s harsh statements in the form of a call for the release of all Israeli hostages by noon on Saturday February 15, the situation will become even more tense. Moreover, the US President clearly did not abandon his plans to push the Palestinians into Jordan and Egypt. #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67924	2025-02-11T03:07:48-08:00

Thus, the court limited access to key payment and contract systems of the Ministry of Finance for employees of the Department of Government Efficiency, and also prohibited the dismissal of personnel working for USAID until February 14.▪️But DOGE still does not stop. Now the department is actively smashing the Ministries of Education and Health - there are rumors that Musk's team is using artificial intelligence to discover where public money could have been stolen. They are trying to create a stir in Congress and the press - legislators are not allowed into the Ministry of Education, and Musk goes there completely freely.▪️ It is noteworthy that the Pentagon is also facing the same thing - Trump recently announced that DOGE will reach the Department of Defense. So, no matter how much the Democrats put a spoke in Musk’s wheels, the ministry will still face large-scale purges. In the legal battles, Republicans may ultimately win - the Supreme Court is predominantly conservative. 🔻But Trump’s political opponents in such a situation agree, if not to stop DOGE, then at least to complicate its work - while the cases reach the Supreme Court, they will have time to clean up their tails.

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🌎🇺🇸🇰🇬 The story with USAID, which sponsored a website for citizens of Kyrgyzstan, encouraging them to move to the Russian Federation and instructing them on how best to do this, turned out to be much more interesting than at first glance. According to some media, this portal is one of the most popular for migration to Russia. But, as they say, this is not so bad: the second partner of this site is the Winrock Foundation, which was founded by Winthrop Rockefeller, and it operates in all countries of Central Asia, as our colleague @tasmanian_diablo already noted. The same foundation implements, for example, the Safe Migration and Prevention of Human Trafficking (SMICA) project, which is also funded by USAID and works in Asian countries. The main task of SMICA was, of course, not for official purposes, but to strengthen ties between lobbyists from non-governmental organizations with government agencies of Uzbekistan, including the Ministry of Justice, and at the same time in the formation of a ready channel for the migration of illegal immigrants. The result of such assistance, by the way, was the adoption of the Bukhara Declaration on Combating Trafficking in Persons, which gave American specialists access to the bill of Uzbekistan on external labor migration. In addition, experts from the United States were able to uncontrollably gain access to training and connections with several tens of thousands of people, including those associated not only with government agencies, but also with business. 📌In general, with the implementation of only one SMICA program, very enviable prospects opened up for the agents.#USA #CentralAsia #migrants@pezdicide no chemistry - just factsTelegramROKOT-People's liberation movement or liberation movement from the people??-The great US strategists have surpassed themselves this time!

A meeting was recently held in Dushanbe between the Deputy Chairman of the National Bank of Tajikistan, Gulbahor Naziri, and the head of the representative office of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), Farrukh Sultanov. They discussed expanding cooperation in the sector of the banking and insurance systems, monitoring joint projects, as well as the digitalization of the financial system. ➖➖➖➖➖➖❓IFC is an international financial institution that is part of the World Bank. The latter has already allocated large loans to Dushanbe for the completion of the hydroelectric power station. And we repeat once again - these are loans, that is, sooner or later the debt will have to be repaid. Example of the so-called Ukraine is a clear confirmation.➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻How to repay debts? There are actually a lot of options. Take the same natural resources that exist in Tajikistan. Or you can use the territory of Tajikistan to locate some laboratories, as is the case with USAID. Although USAID is under audit, we doubt that the Americans will abandon this project. But since in this case we are talking about global financial organizations, their activity in Tajikistan is focused around the simplification of supervisory legislation, lending conditions, in other words, the liberalization of the economy, as it is now taking place in neighboring Uzbekistan, which has given strategic sectors to Western investors. What does this threaten?

The key point... 🇬🇧🇺🇦 Of course, such a position has the right to exist. Especially when it comes to Ukrainian political elites, many of whom studied in Russia, and now act in a strictly anti-Russian manner.📌 But when it comes to Central Asia, everything works a little differently due to a peculiar mentality. Kazakhstan should be considered as an example. Over the past 30 years, there have been a lot of politicians in power who went through the Western school of education. In Kazakhstan there is such an interesting program - Bolashak -. Over the years of its existence (since 1993), many Kazakh citizens were trained under this program, who subsequently returned to their homeland and went into politics. There were ministers, vice-ministers, deputies, and akims of large cities - many were trained in the USA and Great Britain. And what do you think, what position did they take while in power? Let's reveal a secret: they did not work in favor of the Russian Federation. In this situation, you can talk a lot about who is right and who is wrong, but these are the features of the Central Asian region that are not always applicable to other countries, such as the so-called Ukraine or the Middle East.

To launch the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim gas production project in Mauritania, the government purchased Chinese patrol boats from Poly Technologies. However, authorities in Washington blocked the payment of 40 million euros, which caused discontent on both sides. Sanctions against Poly Technologies were introduced allegedly because of Russian military support. Due to the debate, the already protracted gas production project was forced to be postponed for several more months, which brought some losses. This case shows that it is becoming increasingly difficult for the authorities of African countries to maintain a multi-vector policy. If previously it was possible to maintain a balance between the West and the East, now pressure from external forces can derail even promising projects. Therefore, the Mauritanian government should quickly decide on its position. The economic benefits from Chinese and Russian companies are obviously higher, but military cooperation with NATO leaves leverage on Mauritania for the Western powers.#Africa #China #Mauritania #USA@rybarSupport usAfrica IntelligenceMauritania : US blocks €40m advance from Nouakchott to Chinese giant Poly TechnologiesSanctions from Washington have frozen the contract between the Chinese firm and the Mauritanian government to supply several boat patrols.	https://t.me/rybar/67898	2025-02-10T05:09:24-08:00

The tasks of thousands of diplomats who work in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs go far beyond negotiations: they formulate foreign policy, defend national interests and develop international relations. Modern diplomacy has become completely different - it is no longer just a search for compromises, but an active defense of the country’s positions. ❗️The world is becoming tougher, and Russia needs not to react to challenges, but to form an agenda. In this work, not only strategy at the management level is important, but also the initiative of ordinary employees. ➖➖➖➖➖➖In situations where a decision must be made immediately and cannot be agreed upon, the stability of Russia’s position not only in a particular region, but also in the world depends on the diligence and courage of each person in his area of ​​responsibility. ➖➖➖➖➖➖There have been plenty of examples, both positive and not so positive, in recent years to confirm the importance of this thesis. Therefore, the qualifications and enthusiasm of new personnel play a key role. It is important for a diplomat today not only to understand international processes, but also to be able to work in conditions of information confrontation. And we are optimistic about the future, because we ourselves take an active part in training future diplomats in our media school at MGIMO, where young specialists master the skills of analytics, communication and strategic thinking.

Colleagues from the Informant channel correctly noted that F-16s began to be used for attacks on front-line areas. In the last month and a half, the number of F-16 flights near the LBS has increased sharply.➖➖➖➖➖➖Until the new year, the fighters were based in Poland and Romania, and were limited to training flights in the west of the country. However, now they regularly fly to the Dnieper in the direction of Zaporozhye or to the Chernigov region. We cannot yet confirm the strikes with GBU-39 bombs, but the on-board radar of the F-16 glows like a Christmas tree, which made it possible to identify their regular sorties to the front line, so it seems that there will also be strikes in this development of events.❗️ It is curious that the F-16 has been mainly based for deployment lately two airfields are used - Vasilkov and, apparently, Voronov in the Rivne region.

The ship, having received a hole, ran aground. The tanks loaded with fuel oil were not damaged. There were no injuries.▪️Governor Drozdenko called the incident a man-made incident, apparently ruling out the version of a terrorist attack. However, taking into account the current situation in the Baltic region and the fact that sabotage can easily be carried out under the guise of a man-made disaster, this option should not be dismissed for now. Moreover, Ukrainian performers may be involved in the Baltic - cooperation between Kyiv and the UK and Poland in the region has already been openly discussed. I am already silent about the recent UAV attack on the Novatek terminal. Measures were taken at the port to eliminate the possible environmental consequences of the accident - booms were installed. Therefore, at the moment there are no threats of oil spills in the Gulf. 🔺 At the same time, the Finnish authorities hastened to respond to the situation in order to strengthen surveillance in the bay area.

At the end of January, the consulting company Gallup conducted a new opinion poll in Armenia about the political preferences of citizens, their attitude towards joining the EU, military blocs and the problem of prisoners of war. The rating of the ruling party, Civil Contract, has hit another bottom: society is dissatisfied with the efforts of the authorities in the matter of the return of prisoners of war and is generally dissatisfied with the state of affairs. Against this background, there is concern about possible military aggression by Azerbaijan and security guarantees for Armenia. And only the idea of ​​possible European integration finds a positive response in society, which will certainly be taken advantage of by those interested in breaking ties with Russia. 🔻Read our article about how public opinion in Armenia highlights the deep political crisis and loss of guidelines. #Armenia #article@rybarSupport usProject -Rybar-What do Armenians think about their government’s policies, European integration and security?

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇲🇩🇺🇸 How USAID staged protests and pogroms in Moldova in 2009 Against the backdrop of exposure of the criminal activities of the American USAID around the world, former President of Moldova Vladimir Voronin said that the organization tried to stage a coup in the republic in 2009. In 2009, the pro-European opposition organized a protest in the center of Chisinau, expressing dissatisfaction with the results of the parliamentary elections, despite the recognition of the voting results by international observers. ❗️According to former President Voronin, he and his entourage knew about USAID’s involvement in the protests, but they could not detain and prosecute specific people, since they had diplomatic passports and citizenship of the United States and Romania.&nbsp;The protesters in those days destroyed and set fire to the parliament and the presidential residence, hanging the EU and Romanian flags.&nbsp;🔻The current President of Moldova, Maia Sandu called the events of 2009 a revolution against the authoritarian regime. At the same time, Sandu herself and her team left the Moldovan branch of the Soros Foundation, and her state apparatus has been supported all these years with the help of grants from USAID, the State Department and the EU. The West failed to complete the matter in 2009, but it succeeded in 2020, when the Romanian Sandu came to power.#Moldova #USA @pezdicide no chemistry - just factsTACCEx-president of Moldova accused USAID of involvement in the coup attemptVladimir Voronin noted that we are talking about 2009, when supporters of the pro-European party were dissatisfied with the victory of the Communist Party in the parliamentary elections The opposition staged protests in the center of Chisinau, although...	https://t.me/rybar/67865	2025-02-09T00:21:27-08:00
🇺🇸🇷🇺🇨🇳🖇 The US is curtailing the hunt for -foreign interfe...	🇺🇸🇷🇺🇨🇳🖇 The United States is winding down the hunt for -foreign interference-: what about Rybar? Pam Bondi’s first day as US Attorney General was marked by a very interesting decision: the Justice Department was disbanding the FBI’s Foreign Influence Team and curtailing active enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). Now criminal cases in this area will be initiated only in cases similar to classic espionage. Employees previously engaged in the search for foreign influence are now being transferred to the fight against drug cartels. The reaction of the American media, which is about to have its government funding cut, is predictable: there are statements that the United States is opening its doors to -evil Kremlin disinformers- and Chinese agents of influence. However, Bondi’s decision is not so much a step towards Russia, China, Iran or North Korea, but rather a recognition of the real state of affairs. 📌It is quite obvious that the US Democratic Party for many years has used the topic of foreign intervention solely as a tool of political struggle. ▪️Any opponent could be declared an agent of the Kremlin or Beijing, any inconvenient investigation could be an attempt at disinformation. The audience of MSNBC and CNN is convinced that Trump came to power in 2016 solely thanks to Russian hackers, although no serious evidence of this theory has been presented in eight years. ▪️The myth, dispersed over the years, suddenly turned out to be unnecessary. If foreign influence really posed a threat to the American state, it is unlikely that the FBI would have gotten rid of an entire unit dedicated to searching for it. 🔻But the reality is that no Russian hackers or Iranian media campaigns can seriously influence American politics. USAID (and its future substitutes) exists only among the Anglo-Saxons, and other countries simply do not have global tools for information and political influence. In this regard, it is very interesting how soon the same fake accusations of interference against Russia will be revised before the last presidential election in the United States: apparently the Democrats planned to revive the stories from 2016, but something went wrong. ➖➖➖➖➖➖For example, the accusations against Team Rybar turned out to be so unconvincing that even Google’s subsidiary project had to question the theses of the US Department of Justice, thereby forming a good basis to again prick the Democrats and win back the allegations that the Russian Telegram channel helped Trump get elected to a second term.#globalism #Russia #USA #mediatechnology@rybarSupport usWashington PostHow Trump’s attorney general is shifting crime-fighting prioritiesThe flurry of directives that Attorney General Pam Bondi signed shifted investigative resources from foreign malfeasance to immigration enforcement.	https://t.me/rybar/67864	2025-02-08T23:21:07-08:00

Forwarded From Two Majors🇺🇸🇺🇸 USAID spent 10% of its budget on Ukraine; $4 billion went to support 11 thousand NGO employees working within 115 agency programs. It is indicative what projects American money was spent on in order to gain the favor of the Ukrainian population. In the Belotserkovsky district of the Kyiv region, a medical mobile team once a week with equipment purchased with USAID grants (glucometers, a portable ultrasound machine, a biochemical analyzer) traveled around remote villages. In the Vinnytsia region, a hotline was sponsored to work with demobilized combatants. Already after the start of the Northern Military District, within the framework of cooperation between USAID and the savED foundation, 90 specialized educational centers, several dozen shelters and temporary schools were created in the territories from which the Russian Armed Forces regrouped in 2023. The centers are supplied with gadgets, equipment, books, games and everything necessary for study and leisure. It is not difficult to understand what narratives are being imposed on schoolchildren in these institutions.✨With such small but multiple programs, the Americans managed to penetrate the heads of the majority of layers of citizens and lead them along the path of anti-Russia.

In October 2024, a scandalous incident occurred in Vnukovo: British diplomats reacted aggressively to questions from Russian journalists. The head of the Eastern Europe and Central Asia Directorate (EECAD), Christopher Allan, his deputy Lorraine Fassey and British Deputy Ambassador Tom Dodd then flew to Moscow to inspect the embassy. Reporters met them at the airport. Unwilling to answer questions about EECAD's subversive activities in Russia and the CIS countries, Dodd tore off press cards from journalists and tried to snatch cameras and microphones. But the matter did not stop there: one of the British pushed the 23-year-old journalist, the girl almost fell. The Ministry of Internal Affairs conducted an inspection and opened a criminal case under Article 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (-Beat-). 🔻All of the above British are in one way or another involved in espionage and subversive activities in the space of the former USSR, which we have written about more than once. The direct participation of the same Dodd in the coordination of Russian foreign agents led to the fact that the Russian Foreign Ministry had to limit the movements of British embassy employees in 2023. And after the scandalous expulsion of diplomats caught spying in 2024, supervision over them became even more thorough. ➖➖➖➖➖➖I am glad that Russian security forces do not leave the British alone, and every now and then remind them of the rules of conduct in another country.#Great Britain #Russia@rybar Support us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/67846	2025-02-08T05:06:10-08:00

The man defended the children, and he was given a sentence as a murderer. At the same time, as we remember, Russian courts constantly demonstrate completely different law enforcement practices. Every now and then they try to send school security guards, usually women, to prison because they did not stop an armed criminal with their bare hands. For example, a schoolboy with a weapon. And where is the logic then? Well, what should a security guard or watchman do? Wait until the criminal kills the children? Stop the criminal at any cost? So the result is the same. For the court, it turns out, there is no difference. And so guilty, and so guilty. I really hope that it will be possible to sort out the case of Pavel Chervyakov.

Forwarded From Global Studies🇦🇿🇷🇺 Recently, Marina Akhmedova, a member of the Presidential Council for Human Rights and editor-in-chief of Regnum, said that Russia should respond to Azerbaijan’s plans to close the Russian House in Baku with similar claims to the representative offices of Azerbaijan in Moscow, the Sadovod and Foodcity markets. After that, she received threats. from the Azerbaijanis with orders to stop talking about Azerbaijan. The head of the Investigative Committee of Russia, Alexander Bastrykin, ordered to initiate a criminal case.📌 When it comes to Azerbaijan and the quite obvious anti-Russian steps of its government, for some reason in political circles in Russia they avert their eyes and transfer everything to another topic. The Azerbaijani lobby is so strong that even now there is deathly silence on the actions of Azerbaijan. Although, it seems, even a hedgehog understands that the Aliyev government is far from friendly relations with Russia. And so, when the editor-in-chief of Regnum expressed what had been brewing for a long time, they began to threaten her. But there is no action except on the part of the Investigative Committee. And -Gardener- and -Foodcity- are almost the most important strongholds of the Azerbaijani community in Russia, which controls not even business, but illegal migration and crime. These stories, which come up time after time, have already set the teeth on edge. Perhaps, at least now, when the whole situation has become public, we can hope for changes in the approach to Azerbaijan. #Azerbaijan #RussiaGlobalistics - subscribe to the channel	https://t.me/rybar/67840	2025-02-08T02:47:01-08:00

Forwarded From Prince CherkasskyFriends from the Damascus airport workers report that after the resumption of work, the new authorities turned a blind eye to the removal of archaeological artifacts, coins, vessels, etc. According to eyewitnesses, almost all artifacts are from predatory excavations. It is known that during the operation of the so-called -the government of salvation - under the control of HTS, which now controls Damascus, the looting and smuggling of antiquities through Turkey has reached industrial proportions. They took everything away, even tearing out entire mosaic floors, some of which were later discovered in the United States. Now it seems that Idlib practices have been transferred to the newly captured territories. Moreover, these antiquities are being exported quite openly.

Anyone who has been reading us for a long time knows that we really want to give our troops, in addition to the excellently proven national kamikaze drone - Ghoul, which was noted at the highest level, also a much-needed heavy drone. For this, we started the Berdysh project, we announced collections for it, and thanks to all of you, we finally managed to collect serial samples. There were failures, drones fell, during the failures a Special Forces fighter was nominated for a state award, since in a very difficult situation he was able to save many people when a sample with two TM-62s crashed and caught fire. All these are stages of a difficult path when a new type of weapon is produced from scratch. The body was completely changed, many changes were added to the drone and now production samples are going to war. They are traveling to bring death to the enemy, and fire support, ammunition, medicine and provisions to our soldiers on the front line. We need your help, we want, or rather even have to make a lot of such machines. I am sure that our Motherland will not abandon this project, just as it did not abandon the Ghoul, born in a garage and raised with your people’s money. We ask you to help us and very soon this drone, produced by the Ural craftsmen from the team -Turned in War,- will repay everything a hundredfold. Anyone who wants and has the opportunity to help with the purchase of components can do so on the card of Radio Russia presenter Dmitry Konanykhin 2202206288336105 The enemy will be defeated, humiliated and destroyed, and Victory will be ours!

We are not talking about Islamist armed groups, but separatists from the Oromo Liberation Army.▪️In particular, the operation is aimed at countering activities related to trafficking in people and weapons. And if for the Ethiopian authorities the goal is to suppress separatist sentiments, the Kenyan services are striving to prevent smuggling and the expansion of militant activity. It is worth considering that Kenya was recently given the status of an ally outside NATO by the United States, and there is active diplomatic cooperation with the Ethiopians. Therefore, cooperation between them may well have the goal of uniting the two American allies and working out interaction. Such actions are reminiscent of the recent military agreement between the authorities of Morocco and Ethiopia.

The plan for relocating Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, proposed by Trump, may sound absurd, but its feasibility should not be ruled out. This will not be the first time for the territory of Palestine. Only this time, as Israeli media report, the Arabs will be expelled to Africa.▪️Among the proposed options: Morocco and two autonomous regions of Somalia: Puntland and Somaliland. All these countries are ruled by authorities loyal to the Americans, and they also have a Sunni majority, which supposedly will ensure the integration of Palestinians into society. And if the Moroccan leadership has no need to accept refugees from Gaza, since there are doubts about what they will give in return, then the Somali regions are a different conversation.▪️The separatists in Hargeisa have long been trying to extract recognition from at least someone, and at the beginning of last year they found support from Addis Ababa and among Republicans in the United States. And with the coming to power of the new administration, they tried in every possible way to appease the Americans, even offering a military base on their territory. Plans to recognize Somaliland have been on the agenda for a long time and, most likely, will become a coin of exchange in order to force the leadership of Somaliland to accept the Palestinians. The situation is similar with Puntland.▪️So, just the other day, the American Air Force launched strikes on terrorist positions in Puntland. This step was aimed, firstly, at maintaining the image of fighters against terrorism, as well as strengthening ties between the US authorities and the autonomous region. The authorities in Bosaso have severed ties with the feds since last year, so they are also trying to find external support. Considering that there are definitely some contacts between Israel and all these countries, which resulted in a series of loud news headlines, the Palestinians in the new land will remain under the supervision of the Israeli authorities. This is exactly what the ultra-Orthodox will try to achieve, who will try to prevent the formation of Palestinian organizations even in distant lands. Naturally, no one will think about the life of the Palestinians themselves, who will live in non-Arabic-speaking regions, in such a scenario. #Africa #Israel #Somalia #USA@rybarSupport usN12בארה-ב מתכננים Home page All rights reserved.

Then the deputy minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was directly told that the new authorities are not against maintaining the Russian presence, but at a certain price. It is important for the Syrian leadership to establish foreign policy ties not only with Turkey, but also with the rest of the world. The internal political crisis, huge inflation, lack of domestic production, including scarce fuel, made the functionaries of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham more accommodating. Even in relation to Russia. True, like last time, it is important to rationally approach the issue of maintaining our bases in Syria. With adequate costs and sustainable guarantees from the Syrian authorities, negotiations have a right to exist. But whether Ahmad al-Sharaa and his subordinates will be able to provide them when the factions under their control carry out lynching throughout the territory under their control is a debatable question. #Russia #Syria @rybarSupport usWashington PostSyria could allow Russia to keep its bases, new defense minister saysIn an interview, Murhaf Abu Qasra, a onetime leader in Syria’s insurgency, discussed moves by authorities in Damascus to build new alliances.	https://t.me/rybar/67815	2025-02-07T03:25:14-08:00

This is a converted container ship -Perarin-, which was rebuilt into an aircraft carrier. In the footage you can see the deck and the runway about 180 meters long. It also has hangars and an aircraft lift. To protect the ship, there are launchers of anti-ship missiles, as well as Kausar-222 missile launchers. According to the IRGC, the ship can accommodate up to 60 drones and 30 missile boats. Photos and videos from the presentation show reconnaissance and strike drones -Mohajer-6-, prototypes of jet drones based on a fighter, as well as drones -Ababil-3-.➖➖➖➖➖➖Thanks to -Bahman Bagheri-, the Iranians are significantly expanding their operational capabilities to deploy their forces far beyond the borders of Iran. And Iranian engineers did this, one might say, from improvised means, in a short time converting a civilian ship for military needs. Iranian shipbuilding is a clear confirmation that the era of large ships is still far from over. No matter how many -experts- say, currently aircraft-carrying ships are indispensable in the naval forces.#Iran@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67805	2025-02-07T00:20:11-08:00

The Turks have previously transported whatever they want by sea. Visits from Turkish cargo ships have been taking place over the past year and a half with enviable regularity. For example, in the third decade of January, the ship Iasos visited Chernomorsk. It was already noted in Ukraine in December last year. And there is already a stable connection when cargo ships call at Ukrainian ports. When they want to hide their arrival in Ukraine, the crew turns off the identifiers even in Romanian territorial waters. There are no problems with movement and determining the route. Moreover, near Zmeiny, such ships are met by Ukrainian sailors on combat boats, and the entry is controlled from the air by drones -Tekever- and -Bairaktar-. It is interesting that this does not always happen. Sometimes a ship enters openly and does not hide, that is, they are not carrying anything illegal there. But when it happens, as in the diagram above, then you should pay close attention to this vessel.

Forwarded From News Agency -Steklomoy-🇦🇿❤️🇷🇺In connection with the upcoming expulsion of Rossotrudnichestvo from Baku, we present an excerpt from the historical reference -History of Iravan- from the official website of the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Azerbaijan: -After the resettlement of the Armenians in the South Caucasus, a period of bloody clashes and pogroms began. Armed and fully protected and supported by the Russian colonialists, Armenian bandit groups began to exterminate the Azerbaijani people, and the Turkic-Muslim population of the South Caucasus as a whole....Finally, on May 29, 1918, the government of the newly created Azerbaijan People's Republic, not taking into account the will and desires of its people, under pressure from the superpowers, ceded the ancient the Azerbaijani city of Irevan, together with an area of ​​approximately 9.5 thousand square kilometers around the city. In other words, a piece of the Motherland was given to the enemy. And on this very land of Northern Azerbaijan, given as a gift to the enemy, on the territory of the former Iravan Khanate, the Armenian state was created. May 29, 1918! - This is the date of the creation of the first Armenian state on the territory of Northern Azerbaijan in particular, and on the territory of the South Caucasus in general. It is well known that until that time there had never been any Armenian state at all in the South Caucasus. Immediately after the creation of the Armenian region on the territory of the Iravan and Nakhichevan khanates of Azerbaijan, captured by Tsarist Russia, a ruthless falsification of Azerbaijani history began. Armenian nationalists, with the connivance and help of the Russian invaders patronizing them, began to create a fake Armenian history. All archival documents were forged and falsified, even the names and texts of treaties concluded by the Russian Empire with the Azerbaijani khanates, Iran and Turkey. The Armenians, who obtained significant positions and positions in the top management, state and government structures of Russia and the Soviet Union, easily achieved their goals. As a result, starting from the 20-30s of the 19th century, immigrant Armenians resettled by Russia to the South Caucasus en masse began to be called the -most ancient indigenous population- of this region, and the indigenous Azerbaijanis, from whom their ancestral lands, the lands of their ancestors were taken away and given to the Armenians, were called -newcomers,- -nomadic predators.- Armenian nationalists around the world spread deliberately false, falsified information about Azerbaijan and Azerbaijanis. The official website of the Ministry of Defense is not a provincial TV channel or a public page on social networks. In fact, this is a state doctrine and a guide to action (by the way, carefully translated into Russian). This is not so much about the prospects of the Russian world in the republic (ha ha!), but rather for understanding the worldview of the majority of residents of Azerbaijan under 40 years of age, including those who come to our country with the goal of becoming -new Russians-. Good luck building the USSR 2.0, dear comrades.	https://t.me/rybar/67801	2025-02-06T21:05:21-08:00

Forwarded From The Fifth Republic Since the EU - customs hysteria - will also affect Trump, it is interesting to cite the material that was published on the state radio of Canada before the introduction of 25% duties on imports from Canada, which were very quickly canceled for a month, including at the request of a very influential society of American manufacturers. Main messages: 🔺 Canada sells 79% of exports to the USA, this is too much, we need to find other clients (partial awareness that sanctions against the Russian Federation and leaving its market were a mistake - more diversification is needed). The most pessimistic estimates of losses in the event of a trade war in 2025 between Canada and the United States (a decrease of 2.4% of GDP, that is, a recession, from 100,000 to 600,000 cuts in the economy, $100 billion in losses) are also in the treasury of advocates of diversifying the Canadian economy. 🔺 Canada sells meat, cereals, fertilizers, minerals (aluminium, cobalt, nickel...), potassium salt, wood for frame houses, electricity, fuels and lubricants to the USA - duties on the import of its products will primarily hit the wallet of the average American, increase costs in the construction business, agriculture, industry (energy), etc. 🔺 Logistics chains in North America are built between the three countries as a single whole (as in the former USSR or the EU). The engine of the same model of car can be created in the USA, the body made in Canada, and assembled with cheap labor in Mexico = duties on imports from Canada and Mexico will increase the prices of American cars (and make them less attractive for poor US residents than the Japanese, European or Chinese auto industry).🔺 And Canadians can use patriotism to beat the American economy with the Canadian dollar - they buy American wines en masse and go on vacation to Florida, but can buy imported wines from the EU and vacation in the south of Canada, instead of pouring 16 billion Canadian dollars annually into the US tourism industry. Similar conclusions will soon be drawn in the EU... And it may well turn out that the USA is not so exceptional... And not so necessary, unless of course you remember your national interests first of all and do not quarrel at their behest with the rest of the world... Until 1777, European countries somehow lived and even managed to be the leading powers in the world without any US. world...

The enemy really did not achieve much success with the first, but conflicting information comes from the second.▪️Some sources claim that the Ukrainian Armed Forces columns are passing along the northern outskirts of the village from Makhonovka along the Sirovshchina tract and reaching the asphalt road 38K-028. According to objective monitoring footage, two armored vehicles were destroyed on the road where the exit from Konopelka towards Ulanka is located. ▪️At the same time, the settlement of Fanaseevka does not appear in official reports, although, according to our data, enemy movements were noticed there. Now they are using drones there.🔻The column that moved towards Russkaya Konopelka never reached the settlement. Apparently, the enemy either changed plans, or the convoy initially went in the wrong direction. ▪️Reports of attacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the other flank, in the area of ​​Malaya Loknya towards Kruglenkoye, were not confirmed by the end of the day; in those sections of the front there are heavy but positional battles with virtually no changes in control zones. ➖➖➖➖➖➖📌By now, the enemy personnel had scattered across the area in plantings and buildings in the vicinity of Cherkasy Konopelka and Fanaseevka, the surviving equipment was pulled to Sudzha and partially withdrawn to the Sumy region. At the same time, we cannot rule out the possibility of enemy infantry actions in isolation from armored vehicles, of which drones on fiber optics actually burned a lot today.➖➖➖➖➖➖📍In addition, according to preliminary data, at the beginning of the offensive the enemy launched missile air strikes on certain objects in the near rear of the Russian Armed Forces. However, apparently, the targets planned by the Ukrainian Armed Forces turned out to be false, since they had no effect on repelling the attack.❗️The option of a breakthrough by the Ukrainian Armed Forces on a completely different section of the state border is quite possible. As practice has shown, the enemy has quite enough reserves for sudden or relatively sudden attacks. Moreover, in this offensive, judging by the zoo of equipment in the form of the T-64BV, three different types of IMR and solyanka armored vehicles, at least 80 infantry battalions and 82 separate armored vehicles took part, together with attached combined tank groups. ➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 If you have additions to the situation, you want us to highlight the successes of your unit - you can always write to us in the feedback bot @rybar_feedback_bot➖➖➖➖➖➖⭐️ Online maps are available by subscription to map.rybar.ru #Kursk #Russia #Ukraine @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67785	2025-02-06T07:54:31-08:00

For the first time in the history of Russia, today, February 6, a documentary film filmed in the thick of war - in the battle formations of assault groups - is being released in wide release. Ours - by Maxim Fadeev and Sergei Belous - is a documentary tetralogy - At the Edge of the Abyss -. Absolutely honest, uncompromising, sincere and independent cinema, made exclusively with public funds. Therefore, the path to its wide coverage is very thorny: even now, some film chains and cinemas are afraid to release it. Some are afraid of Western sanctions, others are afraid of empty halls (-people won’t go to see a documentary about SVO-). Widespread advertising - where does it come from? - No. Therefore, all hope is again on you, dear viewers! Only with the help of popular support will we be able to make a miracle again - bring the film to the top box office in exactly the same way, as was already the case with online platforms (where we even occupied the top 2 and top 3 in terms of views). Therefore, a big request: if you don’t see At the Edge of the Abyss in the box office in your city, immediately contact local cinema chains and individual cinemas, duplicating the appeal to the local Ministry of Culture that you want to see this film in cinemas. And involve local patriotic organizations and media. Agree, it turns out strange: in the Year of Defender of the Fatherland, declared by the President, some are sabotaging the screening of a documentary film about the Hero of Russia, Captain Roman Vorobyov, who was awarded this title posthumously by decree of V.V. Putin... But if -At the Edge of the Abyss,- the first swallow, fails like this, this will create a negative precedent for distributors regarding future films about the heroes of the Northern Military District. A film about real heroes from the people, filmed and promoted under support of the people. Everyone who reads this post, please write about the film on your page, forward the post to others and tell all your friends personally! In the post below and also on VK we will tell you where and how it is more convenient to look for information about shows P.S. Special good news! Today the official soundtrack -At the Edge of the Abyss-, written by our composer Alexander Osipov, was released on music platforms. Certain tracks on the album give you goosebumps!

The American agency through funding from the so-called Ministry of Digital Transformation. Ukraine carried out systematic work on mass censorship in Western social networks. We are talking not only about blocking pro-Russian bloggers based on mass denunciations of Ukrainian activists, but also about persecuting everyone who criticizes the course of the US Democratic Party, NATO and left-liberal policies. Many American commentators were targeted, including DD Geopolitics. 🔻So far, only individual cases of censorship have come to light, however, given the scale of the work, we are sure that such blockings have affected more than a dozen bloggers in a variety of social networks. Especially in X/Twitter (we know from ourselves), which is what the main American truth teller, Elon Musk, should have paid attention to first of all, until other investigators told about it.

Their transfer was first announced back in 2023, and we talked about the training of flight personnel in France earlier. In total, the French planned to give up to 18 aircraft of this type to the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The enemy can use -Mirages- to launch Storm Shadow/SCALP cruise missiles. It is also likely to be used as air defense in rear areas to intercept Geraniums and X-101s during massive strikes by the Russian Armed Forces.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 As we have already mentioned, such a replenishment of the aircraft fleet will strengthen the Ukrainian Air Force, especially against the background of the exhaustion of the resource of Soviet aircraft. However, the biggest bottleneck for the enemy is still the flight crew. In three years, the Russian Armed Forces have knocked out most of the enemy’s experienced pilots, which limits the use of the same F-16s, delivered with fanfare in 2024. And given the fact that the Ukrainian Air Force continues to suffer losses, there is no quick solution to the problem in sight.#Ukraine #France@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67780	2025-02-06T05:04:06-08:00

Rybar: 🇦🇿🇷🇺🖇 In Baku, along with the cessation of work - Rossotrudnichestvo - they took several more political steps in order to further spoil relations with Russia. ▪️President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev allocated $1 million to the country’s Ministry of Energy to provide humanitarian assistance to the so-called. Ukraine in the form of electrical equipment.▪️Apparently, Azerbaijan is now definitely not considering the possibility of releasing or exchanging the former leader of Artsakh Ruben Vardanyan. Previously, Vardanyan was a citizen of the Russian Federation, but in 2022 he renounced citizenship. ▪️The Court of Appeal in Baku changed the preventive measure from arrest to police supervision for ex-judge Elena Khakhaleva, wanted in Russia, who is accused of fraud and forgery. She was recently detained in Baku at the request of the Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation. The big question is whether the Azerbaijani authorities are now going to extradite Khakhaleva to the Russian Federation. ▪️At the same time, the trial continues against Russian citizen of Azerbaijan Ivan Svetlichny, who is accused of treason, presumably due to connections with the Russian House. 🔻It is obvious that Baku will continue to look for reasons for a targeted aggravation of relations with Russia. The crash of the Azal plane was only a reason for strengthening previously hidden trends. #Azerbaijan #Russia @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar❗️🇦🇿🇷🇺🖇 The Russian House is being closed in Azerbaijan.

Rybar: ❗️🇷🇺🇺🇦 Kursk direction: continuation of the offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Sudzhansky district, which is known as of 14.30 on February 6, 2025. Ukrainian formations continue attacks in the direction of Ulanka and Russian Konopelka. 🔻Frames appear on the Internet that allow you to determine the vectors of the enemy’s movement.▪️Based on the objective control footage, the enemy was able to pass through Cherkasy Konopelka, but two armored fighting vehicles were hit by UAV strikes 177 obrmp on the highway north of Fanaseevka. ▪️Information about the status of Fanaseevka itself is not yet clear, but the loss of Cherkasy Konopelka by Russian troops is confirmed. The bulk of the footage so far appears from the roads just near this settlement. ▪️In addition, in Makhnovka, an IMR M1150 was hit by a drone, and another similar vehicle was attacked in an as yet unidentified location. ▪️The Internet also already has footage of attacks on Bergepanzer 2. And it is the use of scarce equipment, and not the total number of armored fighting vehicles, that speaks of the rather serious plans of the Ukrainian command for these attacks.▪️In addition, our sources confirm an attempt to advance a column of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the direction of Russian Konopelka, but there are no details about this vector of the enemy’s attack yet.▪️Another direction of enemy attacks they call Kruglenkoe, which is in the Malaya Loknya area, but from there the information about the attacks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces has not yet been confirmed.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 If you have additions to the situation, you want us to highlight the successes of your unit - you can always write to us in the feedback bot @rybar_feedback_bot➖➖➖➖➖➖⭐️ Online maps are available by subscription to map.rybar.ru#Kursk #Russia #Ukraine @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67776	2025-02-06T03:40:49-08:00

Ukraine and USAID: so bad that it’s even very good Yesterday, news spread widely on Russian social networks that USAID paid tens of millions of dollars to Angelina Jolie, Sean Penn and other Hollywood stars for visits to the so-called. Ukraine in 2022. However, no mention of this could be found in the documents of the American organization, and the primary source of information was a pair of X (Twitter) users. So the news turned out to be fake.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️And here we would again complain about the need for fact-checking in the domestic segment, if not for a funny moment: the stuffing spread very well in English-language social networks. ➖➖➖➖➖➖This was largely facilitated by Elon Musk, who reposted the news on his X account as part of a personal media campaign criticizing USAID. Donald Trump Jr. did the same. In this case, we are talking about a good example of information warfare: the authors caught the current trends in the Western media field and successfully played on the theme of the stupid injection of USAID funds into Ukrainian grant eaters. Against the background of the audit of foreign aid announced by Trump, new episodes of thoughtless spending of funds will emerge. What can and should really be used to discredit the so-called. Ukraine in the eyes of sponsoring countries, including approaching the issue creatively.#mediatechnology #USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67773	2025-02-06T03:10:24-08:00

There seem to be no obvious reasons for what happened. The last failure of the carrier occurred back in 2018, -Vostochny- is functioning successfully. One can only recall the loss of Luna-25, but in the current realities one cannot dare to call it a mega-failure. It is possible that they simply expected more from Borisov, who was appointed in 2022, given the lag behind the leading space powers. Or his resignation occurred purely for personal reasons (rumors about this have been circulating for a long time).➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 Be that as it may, the new head of Roscosmos will have many tasks. These include an orbital station (ROS) and a manned spacecraft (PTS), pushing the topic of reusable rockets, new devices for exploring the Moon. 39-year-old Bakanov has experience in the industry - he was previously the director of the company operating the satellite communication system -Gonets-. Who knows, maybe this will somehow speed up the emergence of global space constellations in our country, the need for which has been long overdue. #space #Russia@rybarSupport us Interfax Yuri Borisov has been relieved of the post of General Director of Roscosmos.

The commander of the Libyan National Army (LNA), Khalifa Haftar, recently met with the deputy commander of the US Africa Command, John Brennan. The latter praised the efforts of the Libyan government in the east to strengthen security and stability. Haftar, in turn, emphasized the importance of US leadership in resolving the conflict in the country. Given the influence of the United States on the rival eastern government in Tripoli, as well as the significant business interests of Western multinationals in the Libyan oil industry, such meetings are a necessity for Haftar. ➖➖➖➖➖➖That’s why they happened under Biden, and will continue under Trump. ➖➖➖➖➖➖📌In addition, the United States remembered another lever of pressure on the marshal personally, who is an American citizen and has a significant fortune there: recently, a federal court in Virginia decided to continue considering claims against Haftar for war crimes, and new hearings will begin in March.🔻Therefore, in order to balance under such pressure and maintain power in the east, Haftar is attracting allies from the other flank, including from Russia. In particular, the LNA provides us with the opportunity to use the base in Al Jufra and the port in Tobruk to maintain the presence of the Afrika Korps in the country. And how successfully the marshal will be able to maintain the status quo depends on Russian participation.#Africa #Libya #USA@rybarSupport uslana.gov.lyHaftar meets with the Deputy Commander of (AFRICOM).Benghazi, February 4, 2025 (LANA) - The Commander-in-Chief of the General Command of the Armed Forces, Field Marshal	https://t.me/rybar/67766	2025-02-05T23:35:24-08:00
