Were there any incidents, protests, riots? Absolute silence. Even tensions with North Korea have eased. Introducing martial law without any significant reason is a reckless act. And by talking about the imaginary paralysis of power due to possible impeachment, the president is undermining his position. Conducting impeachment proceedings is a constitutional right of parliament, and since the current head decided to go against this, then he is essentially taking the path of dictatorship. He simply did not care about the existing laws and decided that he could maintain power in this way. And this has already affected the exchange rate of the national currency, which has fallen sharply. Further, if the current situation and internal political struggle persist, shares of large corporations and industrial enterprises will go down, which will seriously affect the economy of South Korea. And this is only in the short term. #South Korea @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65991	2024-12-03T07:23:03-08:00

Today, President of the Republic of Korea Yoon Seok-yeol announced the introduction of martial law in the country. Based on his statements, the reason for such measures was the activities of the opposition, which controls the South Korean parliament. In particular, the president accuses her of threatening to paralyze power, since impeachment proceedings are being systematically prepared against him. 🔻Most likely in order to emphasize the seriousness of the situation, Yun called the local opposition North Korean communist forces, from which the country needs to be protected. The main purpose of such statements is to show that they pose a major threat to South Korea. In general, the introduction of martial law is a measure to circumvent parliamentary decisions. According to the country's law, the commander of martial law has authority over all administrative and judicial affairs in the area where it is declared. ▪️At the same time, the opposition is currently moving to the parliament building. Their goal is to lift declared martial law, which they have the authority to do under South Korean law. By the way, rumors about an impending martial law were spread earlier this year by representatives of the main opposition party, Toburo. At that time, many observers called such statements nothing more than scarecrows that were needed to undermine the position of the South Korean president. However, as we see, the rumors turned out to be true. 🔻It is unknown whether the opposition forces will be able to lift the martial law in the country, given that the parliament building is now blocked, and the deputies themselves may be arrested. However, if they still manage to do this, impeachment of the South Korean president will definitely not be avoided. #SouthKorea @rybarSupport us 기도-(종합3보)(서울=연합뉴스) 안용수 김승욱 김영신 곽민서 기자 = 윤석열 대통령은 3일 비상계엄을선포했다.	https://t.me/rybar/65990	2024-12-03T06:45:21-08:00
🔁🖼 🇺🇦⚡️About Western military-technical assistance to Ukraine...	Forwarded From Two Majors🇺🇦⚡️On Western military-technical assistance to Ukraine and likely plans for its use🇺🇸The United States is preparing to send Ukraine weapons worth $725 million, including anti-drone systems, Himars MLRS shells and anti-personnel mines.🇩🇪Yesterday , German Chancellor Scholz announced another package worth 670 million euros, which included 2 IRIS-T air defense systems, 10 Leopard 1A5 tanks, 60 infantry fighting vehicles and armored vehicles, 6 thousand unguided and 500 guided missiles. Two weeks earlier, the package included more than 300 reconnaissance UAVs, one TRML-4D radar, 3 Wisent mine clearing vehicles, 47 MRAPs, 2 Biber bridge laying vehicles, 8 Caracal landing vehicles, 6 M1070 heavy-duty trailers, 20 armored fighting vehicles, Pnz 2000 self-propelled guns and shells for them , 100 thousand HLR 338 sniper rifles.🇳🇱The Netherlands delivered 3 Patriot air defense missile launchers to Ukraine.🇸🇪On November 29, a moving column of Swedish PBV 302 armored personnel carriers was spotted on the German-Polish border, which were heading to Ukraine as part of the aid package announced by Sweden (a total of 250 units were promised. ). Earlier, on November 15, a train with 20 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles was recorded on the 🇷🇴Romanian-Ukrainian border. Also, a large number of equipment from previously announced or not yet announced aid packages could have already been secretly delivered to Ukraine by rail and sea. The emphasis is on strengthening the air defense system and increasing the equipment of reserve brigades. Against this background, Comrade. The Archangel of Special Forces reports the transformation of the 158th separate infantry brigade into a mechanized brigade, which indicates the growth of its combat potential. In addition, the 155th separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, trained and equipped in 🇫🇷France, is preparing to be introduced into battle, 2.5 thousand of whose military personnel recently began to return after training at French training grounds. ✨The specified data indicates the preparation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine of units numbering more than two brigades capable of carrying out offensive actions in individual, weakly protected areas of the front. Such an attack, despite its futility militarily, could become another attempt to obtain Russian lands as a subject for further bargaining in the negotiation process promoted by the West. All the talk in the Western media about the weakness of the enemy and the collapse of the front is a disinformation campaign to hide another provocation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

However, starting tomorrow, the city will begin the transition to Turkish SIM cards, and all traffic in the occupied territories will be controlled by Turkey. In fact, the militants are already actively integrating the occupied areas. By supplying generators from Ankara, electricity problems are being solved there, and shops are already starting to pay in Turkish lira, the value of which is much higher than the local currency. As a result, the victory of the refrigerator over the TV occurs - in the eyes of residents, HTS look like those who brought uninterrupted power supply and gasoline. The number of sympathizers with the militants is growing, and in order to solve everyday problems, Syrians are ready to turn a blind eye to the establishment of Sharia law in Aleppo.📌 And here is a good question - what has been done on our part to combat such scenarios? It was impractical to completely solve all the problems with electricity and fuel for the corrupt government in Damascus, but it was not impossible to do this even in individual locations. Even last year, Prince Cherkassky proposed indicatively taking certain areas or sectors under economic control. For example, to ensure uninterrupted electricity and water supply in Latakia through the supply of pellet heat generators. As a result, the area around Russian bases would become islands of prosperity, which would not only help solve economic problems, but also lead to an increase in sympathy for Russia and an influx of loyal personnel. Later, the experience could be scaled beyond the coast.❗️And while someone continues to naively believe that the Syrians will love us anyway for past deeds, militants with the support of Turkey are actively using the accumulated socio-economic contradictions and taking away sympathy even among segments of the population disloyal to them Syria.#Russia #Syria #Turkey @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65988	2024-12-03T06:01:06-08:00
🖼 🇹🇯🇺🇸 About cooperation between Tajikistan and USAID Not ev...	🇹🇯🇺🇸 About cooperation between Tajikistan and USAID Not even a week has passed since the news about the biological laboratory in Dushanbe appeared, as the Tajik authorities held a new meeting with the Americans. Minister of Health and Social Protection Jamoliddin Abdullozoda received US Ambassador Manuel Micaller and the USAID delegation. Abdullozoda noted that thanks to the support of partners, significant results have been achieved in the country’s healthcare. He emphasized that the department is actively cooperating with the United States through relevant agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Apparently, Dushanbe does not realize at what cost these results can be achieved. Given the US deployment of infrastructure that poses a direct medical and biological threat to the region and directed against Tajikistan’s allies, it is doubtful that it is worth it.❗️But we decided to study how deeply Tajikistan’s cooperation with USAID is developing. We already did a similar analysis in 2022, and were unpleasantly surprised by the dominance of USAID and other similar organizations in Tajikistan. If you look at the map of projects in which the American USAID invested only in 2024, you will understand how much the presence of the structure subordinate to the State Department has grown in various sectors, ranging from education to the business sector. And they focus on small projects, mainly in villages and small towns. Somewhere they gave a grant to open a confectionery shop, somewhere they helped with the opening of a hospital, somewhere they provided drinking water. But this is exactly what ordinary Tajiks need most. And, by the way, from time to time they are helped by the Aga Khan Foundation, which has long been established in Tajikistan - the conductor of British interests in Central Asia. Its universities provide free scholarships to young people not only in Tajikistan, but also in Osh, Kyrgyzstan. And this is just the tip of the iceberg.🔻And since USAID is now closely involved in medicine (and this is directly related to the biolab), cooperation will strengthen. And remembering that USAID is looking for a medical adviser in neighboring Uzbekistan, nothing prevents us from opening the same vacancy in Tajikistan in the near future.

Situation as of 15.00 on December 3, 2024. Early in the morning, media resources - of the Military Council of Deir ez-Zor - - the Arab militia that is part of - US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces - announced the start of Operation -Battle of Return-.▪️The militants launched an attack on the positions of Syrian troops and pro-government tribal militias in the direction of several settlements in the vicinity of the city of Deir ez-Zor. They received limited support from US forces stationed at the Conoco gas field base.▪️The SDF initially had some success, causing damage to government forces. However, having failed to secure the support of the Arab tribes and after the SAR Armed Forces transferred reinforcements from the National Defense Forces (NDF), they lost the initiative and were forced to retreat, losing several fighters. The SDF press service stated that the offensive was undertaken at the request of the local residents of Al-Salhia , At-Tabiya Jazira, Khatly, Khsham, Marrat, Mazlum and Husseiniya, who fear the threat of the expansion of terrorist -Islamic State- (IS) due to the distraction of the Syrian authorities to the north-west of the country. In reality, everything is different: the leaders of pro-American groups in the Trans-Euphrates region have long been sharpening their knives on the lands controlled by official Damascus along the Euphrates. The Syrian authorities use them to bring cells of the Tribal Army into the zone of Kurdish control, which carries out attacks there. The reaction of pro-government Internet resources, which, since the transfer of some territories to Aleppo to the SDS, characterized them with rather neutral terminology, and after what happened this morning called the Kurds -separatist militias-.📌And although the offensive was repelled, the attacks are likely to continue in the near future: depending on the capabilities of the Syrian Armed Forces to improve the situation in Hama and Aleppo. Well, we previously reported that interested parties from this direction will also try to destabilize the situation in the Arab Republic.

The date coincides with the events of 1966, when, on the anniversary of the defeat of German troops near Moscow, the ashes of an unknown Soviet soldier were solemnly buried near the Kremlin wall. This day is dedicated to the soldiers of the Fatherland, those who fell in combat in the country and abroad. To those who have gone missing and lie in unmarked graves. Those who have gone into Eternity, whose name is unknown. But they remain in memory, passed on from generation to generation.

Some of the adults brought with them children aged about 10-12 years. ▪️Some universities, colleges and conservatories stopped their education as part of the strike and also held rallies. The main events took place in Tbilisi, but demonstrations were also observed in other cities.▪️At night, due to attacks on security forces, special forces were called in, who, with the help of water cannons and tear gas, dispersed the rioters throughout the night, who set fire to garbage cans and blocked the streets.▪️ Some of the rioters were detained. It is noteworthy that the most active ones wore masks and were the first to hide from the police. Probably, they are the ones who act as a kind of foreman who lead the crowd.▪️In the morning, representatives of educational institutions went on strike again. Students and teachers in Tbilisi, Zugdidi, Batumi, Rustavi and Khashuri demand the cancellation of the current government’s decision to suspend the EU accession process.❗️However, there are no prerequisites for achieving the goals. The government and security forces are successfully keeping the situation under control, knowing that sooner or later the protest potential will decline. And there were many examples of this. In Iran, demonstrations and riots lasted for about a year, and the protesters did not achieve their goals. The spring protests of disobedience in Georgia were also unsuccessful, despite the pressure and help of the West in organizing all this.🔻However, another problem may arise in Georgia: several channels of the Georgian Legion, fighting for the Armed Forces of Ukraine, reported the transfer of mercenaries to Georgia to help the opposition . But the ruling party knew about this back in the spring and was preparing for such a scenario.

However, the day before, on November 11, protests against the agreement began in Sukhumi, which by November 15 escalated into an assault on the parliament building. After these events, President Aslan Bzhania announced his resignation, which parliament soon approved. Early presidential elections are scheduled for February 15.🔻And let us again emphasize the paradox of the situation: the republic, which exists entirely on financial support from Russia, refuses to open the doors to Russian investment. Moreover, provocative steps are being taken in Abkhazia, such as organizing an exhibition dedicated to the terrorist Shamil Basayev. Such actions not only harm the economy of the region, which, due to weak local governance, is at the same level as 20 years ago, but also undermine relations with the main donor - Russia. Abkhazia is effectively rejecting opportunities to improve its infrastructure and the well-being of its citizens. This case illustrates the problems of Russian policy in its near abroad. Over the years, relying on the -carrot- without using the -stick- has led to the fact that Moscow’s economic and political assistance has come to be taken for granted, and steps towards it have been taken for granted as weakness. Now Russia faces ultimatum behavior even from those who are completely dependent on its support.#Abkhazia #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65982	2024-12-03T01:57:56-08:00

Turkmen media routinely reported on the successful increase in cooperation between Ashgabat and Washington in a number of areas , especially noting the great contribution to the business council -Turkmenistan–USA-. But this was not the main track of Daines’ visit.❓The American senator came to Turkmenistan for the same purpose as he came to Tajikistan - because of minerals. And we are not talking about gas or oil. Nitrogen fertilizers have become the main exports of Turkmenistan to the United States in recent years. Ashgabat began producing them for export in 2018 with the opening of a urea plant in Garabogaz. And now there are rumors that there are plans to expand production. As the American ITA points out, Turkmenistan plans to increase their fertilizer production to 5 million tons per year. In 2023, it was possible to reach more than a million tons per year.🔻Turkmenistan is a convenient place for the production of fertilizers. To create them, you need natural gas, which is abundant in Turkmenistan, if you just look at the number of oil and gas fields and enterprises. Therefore, the enthusiasm of the Turkmen authorities is understandable (especially against the backdrop of interest in the Middle Corridor). Washington’s plans are also clear - this will increase competition in a strategically important market to the detriment of Russia, which occupies a leading position in it. Well, special attention should be paid to how actively Western countries began to court Turkmenistan, which is increasingly appearing in the headlines of newspapers and various publications, which clearly confirms the growing interest in the country as a raw material base of the West.

The words of the Kazakh politician are a continuation of what had begun in October, a discussion in which Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said that Russia and The PRC is considering a new gas supply route that could pass through Kazakhstan. The possibility of laying a gas pipeline was discussed back in 2020, but for economic reasons the choice was made in favor of Mongolia. However, due to the latter’s withdrawal from the project, Kazakhstan may again become a transit point. And Kazakhstan’s interest is quite understandable. Through transit, Kazakhstan intends not only to enrich itself, but also to gasify the border East Kazakhstan and Pavlodar regions. Now these regions are not connected to the main gas supply, so residents use coal and wood. The Kazakh leadership is trying to take advantage of the situation and is offering its territory for a project that promises great benefits. In the context of serious problems in the energy system and seasonal discontent of the population, such a project, despite the timing of its implementation, is needed by Kazakhstan, which in turn should be taken advantage of by our country. #Kazakhstan #China #Russia @rybarSupport usTACCAstana is ready to provide territory for a gas pipeline from the Russian Federation to ChinaRelevant the decision will be determined by the need to supply certain volumes of gas, said the Minister of Energy of Kazakhstan Almasadam Satkaliev	https://t.me/rybar/65980	2024-12-02T23:39:00-08:00

The spokesman for the Iraqi people's militia, Al-Hashd al-Shaabi, Muhannad al-Aqabi gave an interview to the publication Al-Mayadeen, where he spoke about the reasons for whom the group decided to help the Syrian authorities.🔻Main points:➖Iraq has extensive experience in confronting terrorists, and what is happening in Syria is dangerous for the entire region, not just Iraq. And the AKhaSh units specialize in the fight against terrorism.➖The scenario of past years should not be repeated, especially in Iraq. The country does not need terrorists who committed mass murders in Syria like IS.➖The actions of the militants are dictated from the outside. If they are fighting for the truth, then why did they not confront the massacres in Lebanon and Palestine? All because Israel is covering up the activities of militants.🔻-Al-Hashd al-Shaabi is the group that at one time played a huge role in the victory over the Islamic State. It was the militia fighters who were at the forefront of the fight against terrorists, operating in the thick of events in Iraq. This is how they earned their status and reputation. The possible consequences of what is happening in Syria are extremely serious, so the Iraqi units decided to help their neighbors. The events around Aleppo have already given impetus to other forces: in the south, rebellious tribes have raised their heads, and in the deserts in the east they are talking about ISIS. It is obvious that in the event of even greater destabilization in Syria, the situation will also affect Iraq. In addition to terrorists, Iraq will be one of the first countries to which refugees from Syria will rush, which will affect the economic well-being of Iraq, which has only just begun to recover. Their appearance in Syria, as well as the arrival of Seyyid Javad, will clearly help the distressed Syrian troops. At the same time, as we have already noted, Iraqi units operate separately from Iran, and they work within the framework of their own political track.#Iraq #Iran #Syria #terrorism@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65977	2024-12-02T14:22:52-08:00

The enemy planned the attack on Qalaat al-Madyk for the morning of this day, and eventually carried it out, despite the strikes of the Russian Aerospace Forces. The first attacks by the militants failed, but by now the Syrians have confirmed the loss of Qalaat al-Madyk and that the fighting is actually already underway south of the settlement, indicates a difficult situation. Apparently, the enemy is approaching the Christian village of Skalbiya, which, if the militants are successful, will face a massacre.▪️In the area of ​​Al-Mughira and Berij, fighting also continues, as well as in the vicinity of Hamamiyat. Militants claim drone and anti-tank missile attacks on Syrian tanks. At the same time, the Syrians here, looking at the available information and footage, are still holding back the attacks of the groups.▪️The presence of militants remains in Kafr Zeit and Al-Latamna, and helicopters of the Syrian armed forces are using barrel bombs in Khan Sheikhoun and Maaret An-Numan. In Halfaya, Taibat al-Imam and Maardas, the situation is stable, the cities are under government control. 🔻At the same time, militants consistently claim and post footage of drone strikes on the territory of Halfai, Hama and the Hama military airfield. Also today, there were statements about the destruction of several tanks and other equipment, as well as one helicopter. The provincial capital was also shelled. In the Ba'ath region, five local residents were killed and three were injured. ▪️The most difficult situation is observed northeast of Hama, where large concentrations of militants are recorded in the vicinity of the village of Maar al-Shikhur and further north in Mrewada and Al-Mbattan. Apparently, they are trying to break through to the mountain range east of Hama, which could make it easier for them to fight further in the vicinity of the city.▪️At the same time, fighting continued in Fan Kubla throughout the day. Both Syrians and militant groups reported heavy fighting in the populated area. At the same time, no one has yet declared their control over the city. In addition, information continues to emerge about militants moving further east. However, for now they remain words without objective control footage.

After his death, it was he who was responsible for the operations - the axis of resistance - in Syria and Iraq. ▪️ He is a difficult person (and some of our team had the opportunity to get to know him personally), who opposed any agreements with terrorists and spoke about the need for the complete destruction of extremist groups , including in Idlib.▪️Because of his position in the administration of Bashar al-Assad and in Hezbollah, who sought negotiations, asked to remove him from operations in Syria, which caused him to return to Iran. But now, when the situation has reached a critical point, he was returned to help.❗️Why do we think this is good news for Syria? He is a member of the old guard of the IRGC and really knows his stuff. It’s not for nothing that pro-Turkish channels call him the -butcher of Aleppo,- who caused them a lot of problems in past years. Considering how much Hezbollah has weakened and how many Iranian generals were lost during Israeli air force strikes, his arrival will help the Syrian leadership .

The situation is absolutely standard when, through pro-Western politicians, various NGOs and NGOs in the country are trying to carry out a coup d'etat similar to the Ukrainian Maidan. But events in Georgia may affect not only the Transcaucasian republic, but also one of the countries of Central Asia. We are talking about Kyrgyzstan, in which representatives of the same externally funded structures are preparing to organize protests.❗️According to our data, some representatives of the largest NGOs in Kyrgyzstan are currently in Tbilisi, where they are studying the experience of organizing protests for possible application in Bishkek . ▪️Among them and, probably, at the head is journalist Adil Turdukulov, known for his interviews with the President of the so-called Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky, as well as frequent visits to the Ukrainian embassy in Kyrgyzstan.▪️ The list of Kyrgyz oppositionists in Georgia includes pro-Western journalists Leila Saralaeva and Makhinur Niyazova, who have been noted more than once for their critical views on Russian politics. ▪️And another famous activist and Russophobe Toleykan Ismailova also arrived with them. She is the head of the NGO -Bir duino- (-One World-), which is engaged in the protection and promotion of LGBT ideas in Kyrgyzstan.🔻All of them have been repeatedly convicted of openly promoting Western narratives. Turdukulov, in addition to the interview with Zelensky, visited Bucha, where he filmed routine material about the shooting of a civilian car by Russians. Leila Saralaeva more than once participated in anti-Russian protests organized by the Ukrainian embassy in Bishkek. And Ismailova is a regular at such events in Bishkek, being the main defender of the LGBT community under the auspices of American NGOs and NGOs.📌 Now they have arrived in Tbilisi to study Georgian methods of protest activity aimed at -upholding democratic values ​​and civil liberties-. In addition to participating in staged filming about the authorities’ repression of peaceful protesters, they can certainly try to adapt these methods for their use in Kyrgyzstan. Moreover, there have already been attempts, and largely thanks to operational intervention, all this was prevented.

Romanian citizen Sandu admitted that she herself would go to vote and urged not to believe those who are trying to convince that the Kremlin can bring peace and prosperity. As we wrote, elections in Romania are important for Sandu’s team, which does not benefit from the victory of the unpredictable candidate Calin Georgescu, the leader first round. Moreover, Georgescu opposes the help of the so-called. Ukraine and will certainly call into question relations with the United States and NATO, which is extremely unfavorable for Sandu. That is why a big bet is placed on holders of dual citizenship of Romania and Moldova, and there are about 1.2 million people in these elections. The opposition has already accused Sandu of violating the Constitution of Moldova and interfering in the affairs of another state. ▪️In addition, Sandu again supported the protests in Georgia on the day when the opposition tried to set fire to parliament and were dispersed by special forces. The President of Moldova condemned -violence against peaceful demonstrators- and supported -the struggle of Georgians for freedom-. With such statements, Sandu is trying to create an image for himself as a fighter -for democracy-, when in Moldova itself elections are rigged and any criticism of the authorities is condemned. And the inconsistent and aggressive policy of Sandu’s office has put the republic in the face of another energy crisis and humanitarian catastrophe, but, apparently, this is the fight for freedom. #Georgia #Moldova #Romania @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇲🇩 About the impending energy disaster in Moldova In Moldova, after the presidential elections and the referendum on European integration, they suddenly remembered the pressing problems and started talking about the fact that the republic would face difficult times and an energy crisis.

The Kurds have lost their positions in the north and are withdrawing their forces to Manbij and further beyond the Euphrates, the militants are occupying settlements abandoned by the Syrians. 🔻Filtration activities and collection of trophies are taking place everywhere. Footage appears on the network with dozens of pieces of various equipment left behind during the retreat by both the Syrians and the Kurds, which comes under the control of the militants.▪️In particular, the militants are expanding control in the vicinity of Sefira, where they are also searching for various equipment suitable for continuing the jihad. In particular, at the base of the 599th Air Defense Regiment, militants captured several S-125 complexes. However, at the moment they are just firewood, since the complex was captured in exactly the same condition during the first wave of the so-called Syrian Revolution.▪️In addition, the militants captured several military bases and arsenals. Some pro-terrorist channels even claim 800 thousand missiles to -Grad-, captured in one of the warehouses, but this is clearly an exaggerated amount. But nevertheless, they acquired a large number of shells.❗️At the same time, the Syrians are spreading propaganda that the Ukrainians and Americans are to blame for the failure of the defense (strangely, not the Turks). At the same time, more dangerous misconceptions are also voiced, leading to underestimation of the enemy. According to our information, the Syrian side is trying to downplay the scale of the problems by conveying information to its allies (not only Russia) that most of the equipment captured by the militants is not operational. And this is at a time when not only dozens of infantry fighting vehicles and tanks, but also air defense systems fell into the hands of terrorists.

Forwarded From Departamente🏳️🇺🇦At Rybar they again raised the topic of the omnipotence of the Ukrainian special services, which, according to our media, played a decisive role in the terrorist attack on Aleppo, and, of course, this does not correspond to reality. Ukrainians were both in the viper of Idlib and, as they recently confirmed to me, in Malian Taodeniya. In both places they carried out extremely limited training activities for militants. At the same time, their effectiveness for the same Azawad separatists turned out to be extremely doubtful. To say that everything went wrong because of external forces is stupid. All this is rather a game for the benefit of Ukraine, which receives extra PR in the Western media, waging a war with Russia -on all fronts-.

Ukrainian formations are launching attacks on several sectors of the front, making extensive use of armored vehicles and UAVs. Over the past two months, Russian troops had to withdraw from part of their positions, while maintaining the stability of the front and inflicting serious damage on the Ukrainian Armed Forces. ▪️Fierce fighting has been going on on the western flank in the Glubokoye area over the past months. The southern outskirts of the settlement have already changed hands several times and are ruins. Ukrainian formations are trying to fly into the village in armored vehicles, but such attacks are successfully repelled by infantry forces with the support of UAV and VKS operators. At the same time, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are also attacking the flanks of Russian troops in the village, trying to cut it off from supplies and complicate the approach of reserves. Units of the Russian Armed Forces, in turn, launched several attacks in the Zelenoye area in order to pull enemy forces away from Glubokoye and occupied part of the positions north of the village. ▪️In the central area, the fighting continues unabated. Both sides are actively using drones, artillery and aircraft, which leads to the destruction of populated areas and the expansion of the gray zone due to a decrease in the number of places for potential shelters. A similar thing happened in the Staritsa area - at the moment, neither side has stable control over the village. ▪️During November, the Ukrainian Armed Forces launched many attacks in the Volchansk area. In several sectors, the Russian Armed Forces withdrew from forward positions due to difficulties with supplies and consolidated on lines more suitable for defense. ▪️At the same time, the territory of the Volchansky Aggregate Plant is currently located in the gray zone. After the enemy units that entered the territory of the enterprise were driven out of there with the help of massive air strikes, the territory of the object became practically unsuitable for defense. Units of the Russian Armed Forces conducted several raids on the territory of the enterprise, but did not establish a foothold there. The plant received significant damage, most of its workshops were almost completely destroyed - in such a situation there is no point in clinging to it. Today, the positions of Russian troops lie west of the enterprise territory along Sobornaya Street. To the east of the city, the Russian Armed Forces have positioned a defense line in forest belts north of Tikhoy. ❗️During more than six months of fierce urban fighting, the northern part of Volchansk was almost completely destroyed. In such conditions, assault operations turned out to be difficult, and the main attention of the Russian command was transferred to areas more favorable for the offensive. Some of the units were transferred from the direction to the Kursk region. The enemy, trying to drive the Russian Armed Forces out of the city, is suffering significant losses in personnel and equipment. ▪️Ukrainian formations do not abandon their intentions to cause maximum damage to the civilian infrastructure of the Belgorod region. From September 27 to today, more than 200 residents of the region were injured and 18 people were killed as a result of drone attacks and shelling from cannon artillery and MLRS. The enemy deliberately attacks civilian equipment, commercial enterprises and social facilities. The regional authorities are striving to protect the civilian population, for which purpose specialized shelters are installed in populated areas, and vehicles are equipped with electronic warfare systems. ▪️In turn, Russian troops regularly strike military targets in the Kharkov region. Thus, in November, more than two dozen attacks were recorded on the infrastructure of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the region.

And these guys, even during the years of the active campaign against the Islamic State, were not distinguished by their intelligence and intelligence. - Excellent - in terms of content, intelligence reports and reports still cause laughter, since the lion's share of the information they obtained was taken from the sky while smoking a hookah and drinking mate. 📌 When our state media write such praises for the enemy’s intelligence structure, you stop being surprised by anything. We wrote that the participation of the Main Intelligence Directorate in the training of militants was for the most part just to show off. They had no influence on the planning, much less the conduct of the operation in Aleppo. Believe more in the gardeners from local intelligence agencies, who themselves slept through the preparation and offensive of the terrorists, although data from our intelligence was constantly transmitted.❗️By legalizing such theses, we ourselves, in our media, are turning the Ukrainian state into a super-monster, effectively fighting Russia and Russian proxies abroad .

The Kurdish enclave in Tell Rifaat and Al-Sheikh Maksoud is being evacuated to the east after agreements were concluded with HTS and SNA militants. Thus, there are no non-militant controlled areas in Aleppo. And most of the province itself is almost completely captured by gangs. Against this background, it is curious that those who are responsible for the media of pro-Turkish militants remember well the successful cases from 2015-2020. Now, as at the time of the removal of the moderate opposition from Daraa and other areas of Syria, the same green buses were used to transport the Kurds. And militant propagandists did not forget to boast about this fact, clearly keeping in mind the moments of past years. At the same time, the outcome of the Kurds was expected, given their surroundings. But the Syrian Democratic Forces are most likely preparing for a new clash, since pro-Turkish militants with Turkey behind them do not intend to stop. Moreover, as practice shows, concluding peace treaties with someone who will never comply with them is an extremely stupid idea. And Turkish drones throughout the militant operation actively attacked areas controlled by the SDF. #Aleppo #Idlib #Syria@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65956	2024-12-02T04:32:01-08:00

Forwarded From Balkan Gossip Girl And while I was surfing through Albanian resources, I discovered something completely outstanding. A new investigation into the threat to the region posed by Serbian Telegram channels and their connections with the Russians. The growth in the number of patriotic resources, their popularity, coverage and views is of serious concern. The expert is Stefan Janjic, a professor at the Department of Journalism from Novi Sad and the chief editor of the Serbian fake news portal. As part of the investigation, the Albanians analyzed the channels BUNT је facе spirit, CORRIDOR, BUNKER and Srpska Sparta-info. 🤦🏻‍♀️ I thought that at least this time we would be surprised by the wonders of OSINT. But no. When studying the harmful influence of my respected Serbian colleagues, would-be investigators used Telemetrio. According to which, about 916 channels mentioned or reposted from Riot, indicating a much wider network of interconnected channels than can be traced at the moment. Eh, are you really an investigator?🙄 The Russian trace is evident, believe it or not, in the Z symbols, which the Serbs still proudly wear to all rallies. And also in the form of nationalistic and militant graffiti about Kosovo and Metohija. -This clearly shows that the activities of pro-Russian groups do not remain only in the virtual world of Telegram, but also manifest themselves in real life,- experts say. Doubtful, but okay. Since the beginning of the year, when the government of the self-proclaimed republic began to actually clear out municipalities with a Serb majority and banned the use of the dinar, and Kosovo security forces began to frequent the north of the region, the Riot, you see, shows the situation as a -state of war- when -Albanian terrorists invade- to the north, attacking targets such as hospitals, schools and post offices with -long guns-. Wasn't that how it was? According to experts, such language could provoke a violent reaction from Albanians against the Serbs. That is, you need to remain silent and watch how the Serbian municipalities of the region are strangled, did I understand correctly?📝 In general, it’s interesting to influence the masses. -Many Serbian users believe that such nationalist ideas correspond to their worldview and understanding of international politics, which motivates them to actively disseminate these views,- says Janjic. -But some people initially join online groups or channels for apparently apolitical reasons—for example, seeking medical advice or discussing cultural topics. However, these platforms often serve as gateways for the slow and subtle spread of political messages. Users are exposed to geopolitical narratives. It’s impressive that only the impact of the media on mass and individual consciousness in the digital environment is taught in social studies classes in the 10th grade. I don’t understand what the professor wanted to surprise us with here. In a separate group, Janich includes narratives with a flavor of Euroscepticism and anti-globalism, which attract readers disappointed by the long process of European integration. He said one of the goals of Russian propaganda in the Balkans is to weaken trust in Western powers by portraying the West as a failure in efforts to bring stability and democracy to the Balkans. This often leads to the idea that the West hates Serbia. As a result, many are turning to Russia, seeing it as an alternative to Western structures. They consider joining BRICS and idealize Russia, basing their admiration on imagined aspects of cooperation and history. The Serbs are led to believe that the West hates Serbia by statements from US congressmen in the style of -degenerates and murderers,- tons of depleted uranium dropped on Serbian soil, and UN General Assembly resolutions labeling the Serbian people -genocidal.- Mr. Janic is to teach the history and psychology of media communications of the digital era, and a big hello to our friends from the above-mentioned Serbian channels.

Forwarded From Warsaw Mermaid🇵🇱🇩🇪🇷🇺 On December 1, an oil leak occurred at one of the sections of the Druzhba pipeline in the Pniewa region in western Poland. Although it did not pose a risk of explosion or fire, state pipeline operator PERN cut off fuel supplies from the east and west. -Druzhba- supplies Germany with oil, namely the Leuna and Schwedte refineries. According to PERN, this incident did not affect the volume of supplies, and oil pumping is already on schedule, Transneft said.🔻The first alarming signal was the smell of gas, noticeable in the vicinity of the gas station and hotel located near the oil pipeline. After this, an oil spill was discovered. PERN then proactively shut down one of the stations. The security services explained that there was no danger to residents.

An investigation into the causes of damage to the oil pipeline is currently underway, and according to PERN, external influence, including sabotage, cannot be ruled out. In addition, it became known that Hungary and Slovakia are also conducting their own investigation into the possible preparation of a terrorist attack on the Druzhba pipeline, through which oil from Russia flows to the countries of Eastern and Central Europe.❗️On November 30, the day before the incident in Poland, the Slovak media reported that activity was recorded in the east of the country indicating a possible terrorist attack on the Druzhba oil pipeline. The republic's Interior Minister, Matus Shutai Eshtok, said security forces had disrupted the activities of a group that appeared to have an interest in the pipeline.

The SRPS Agreement became part of the new EU strategy for building relations with the countries of the region, aimed at enhancing the image of the European Union as a global player.▪️In addition, he noted the importance of Uzbekistan’s transition to green energy, within the framework of which SECCA (Sustainable Energy Connectivity) projects operate in Central Asia) and Team Europe Initiative (TEI).▪️And at the end he stated that the European Union is focused on the development of the Trans-Caspian Multimodal Transport Route (TMTM), the importance of which Western politicians try to remind at every opportunity.🔻It is clearly visible that Uzbekistan is being treated on all fronts. Thus, the EU intends to engage in all significant areas of public administration, from energy to the economy. And the Uzbek authorities are actually letting the goat into their garden with quite obvious consequences for the republic. At the same time, they do not forget about military cooperation in the EU: in October, the same Klaar spoke about the -huge danger emanating from Afghanistan.- By inflating these problems, Western countries lobby for their services to the states of the region.#Uzbekistan #EU #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usGazeta.uzNew EU Ambassador to Uzbekistan Toivo Klaar has begun workThe newly appointed Ambassador of the European Union to Uzbekistan Toivo Klaar has begun his duties.

Under the whistling of bullets and exploding shells, among the dirt and blood, people are left alone with questions that are easy to ignore in peaceful life. What motivates us in our darkest hour? Where to look for strength when everything seems to be lost? The series There are no atheists in trenches is an attempt to capture an invisible but tangible reality: faith becomes a saving thread connecting a person with something greater than himself. In the dark trenches, faith ceases to be an abstraction and becomes a living, burning experience. This is not just tradition or habit - it is the conviction that beyond human will and fear there is a higher providence that guides and protects. Everyone who takes up arms does so with a different heart. But for those who believe, the trench becomes not just a line of defense, but a place of spiritual struggle and, perhaps, purification. Faith does not abolish suffering, but gives it meaning. It teaches us to stand where it seems impossible to survive, and to see the light that remains invisible to those who turn away from it.🔻High-res art🔻▪️Trench symbol▪️Light of hope▪️Give me a sign▪️Our cause is just▪️ We survived▪️Everything will be fine#art #faith #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65945	2024-12-02T01:01:45-08:00

Well, on the same day as the statement by Bassirou Faiy, Macron called the French attack on African soldiers in Thiaroy a massacre, admitting France’s guilt. This indicates consistency in the withdrawal of military personnel. Therefore, despite the active development of cooperation between Senegal and the Russian Federation and the PRC, all actions of the Senegalese remain under French (primarily economic) influence, which is very deeply entrenched in the country.

Recently it became known that in Ethiopia, after the opening of the geological class of the Karpinsky Institute, the country's first sambo center was opened. This is one of the stages of the implementation of the international project - Sambo in granite - to promote the Russian type sports as part of Russian culture.📌Earlier we talked about the discovery of Karpinsky’s geological classes in other African countries: Ghana and Mozambique. In addition, the Institute’s projects are present in Kyrgyzstan and Cuba. And in the future, it is planned to expand to other countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa. The goal of the project is to create a network of scientific centers in friendly countries, on the basis of which (in addition, of course, to promoting the Russian language through training and scientific exchange) it will be possible to solve problems related to geology and subsoil use, as well as with the formation of a local personnel base for Russian-African projects. All this together allows us to form fertile soil in the managerial and scientific elites of countries where it is necessary to promote Russian economic and geopolitical interests. And such applied projects are not just a good way to teach potential partners to speak the same language with Russian specialists, but also an example for other potential investors who are counting not on immediate results, but on fundamental long-term cooperation.

Ukraine. The greatest results were achieved in Rivne, where an X-101 aircraft missile with cluster submunitions hit a city substation.▪️Another effective target among energy facilities was the substation in Ternopil. Several Ukrainian air defense drones were shot down, while others successfully hit the target, which led to power outages.▪️Combined strikes against Ukrainian Armed Forces facilities and in the Odessa region did not stop throughout the week. The targets of the raid were port infrastructure, temporary deployment points and air defense position areas.▪️Ukrainian formations, meanwhile, again attacked the old territories of Russia with Western weapons. The airfield in Kursk came under attack from missiles with cluster submunitions, most of them were shot down, and the runway received minor damage.▪️The Ukrainian Armed Forces also attacked an oil depot in Kaluga with drones. Several tanks were damaged, but the fire was quickly extinguished.▪️The notorious oil storage facility of Rosrezerv - Atlas - in the Rostov region came under attack again. As a result of the detonation of several drones, at least two tanks caught fire, and the fire is still being extinguished.▪️The Ukrainian formations were not spared the Crimean Peninsula. This time the enemy tried to hit energy facilities and military airfields. As a result of the combined attack, 25 drones and two anti-ship missiles -Neptune- were shot down in the sky; there were no consequences on the ground.▪️In the Kursk direction, Russian troops continued to carry out an operation to consistently de-occupy the region.

The number of the group is a couple of hundred people and, purely theoretically, they could have infiltrated through the desert - especially considering the withdrawal of troops. But so far not a single objective evidence of this has appeared on the Internet.▪️The Bakkara tribe, loyal to Bashar Assad, allegedly set out from Deir ez-Zor on the very first day and went almost in full force to Aleppo. Similarly, units of Maher Assad’s 4th Division advanced from Deir-e-Zor, which, however, did not seem to be there. ▪️All this did not stop the militants (both IS and HTS with the SNA) from declaring that the convoys coming to the aid of Assad had already been bombed by the militants. Someone wrote about IS, someone wrote about the Free Syrian Army from Al-Tanf. As a result, no one went anywhere and no one killed anyone. But real reinforcements arrived on the third day. In essence, footage appeared of Iraqi detachments of Al-Hashd al-Shaabi crossing the border with Syria at the official Al-Bukamal border crossing from the Iraqi Al-Qaim. Considering that very close to Al-Bu Kemal there is an Iranian military base named after Imam Ali, and even further to the west there is a road leading directly to Palmyra from the south, it is more logical to assume that the reinforcements were divided into several columns, and only footage from one of them.📌On the Internet, the convoy was immediately destroyed by the media, announcing shelling from the Americans. In fact, the explosions were mistaken for the work of the Syrian military against nomadic militants in the desert (which once again confirms the activity of terrorists). As we have already written, the appearance of the Iranian detachments - Al-Hashd al-Shaabi - should not be considered an unambiguously Iranian move, since the XIII certainly does not classify itself as an outright pro-Iranian group. In this case, we are talking, first of all, about assistance from Iraq.

Also, the fighting does not subside in the south of the city in the vicinity of the Blok-9 and Yugo-Vostochny mines. In the Pokrovsky direction, Russian troops are advancing in several areas at once, advancing in the direction of Pushkino, as well as liberating Yuryevka and Pustynka. In the Vremyevsky direction, Russian army soldiers started fighting on the eastern outskirts of Novy Komar, expanding the zone of control southwest of Razdolny.

Syrian troops have already begun to announce the liberation of settlements (this time actually previously lost). ▪️By the evening, the release of Khalfaya, cleared from militants, was confirmed. The status of Suran is still unclear.▪️In the Taibat al-Imam area, Syrian troops engaged mobile militants and were hit by drone strikes. It is in this area that there is great activity of the newly created militant unit, armed with attack UAVs -Shahin-. ▪️Frames have already appeared on the Internet showing FPV drone strikes on cars and supposed locations of Syrians, but apparently, this could not stop the counter-offensive. Syrian troops have clearly recovered from the initial shock and began to move north towards Khan Sheikhoun (the latter still under militant control). ▪️From Maaret al-Numan, militants are bringing in reinforcements and equipment, including from recently captured tanks and infantry fighting vehicles. East and west of the M5 highway, both sides continue to claim control over populated areas (confusion continues).▪️In the vicinity of Qal'at al-Madiqa and the Shashabo Mountains region to the north, the situation is much more complicated. Judging by the available data, the settlements on the ridge actually came under the control of the militants, but however, there were not too many Syrian military personnel here. The militants declared Qalaat al-Madiq as occupied. The Syrians later claimed to have caught several sleeper cell members there. And at the moment, the settlement is apparently under the control of the Syrian army. However, the sparseness of the troops can play a bad joke.▪️In the city of Hama, judging by journalists' reports, the situation remains calm, even taking into account the fact that air defense systems at the Hama military airfield were activated several times during the day. Militants are attacking the airfield with drones. Including today, footage from an FPV drone that attacked a helicopter parking lot on the eastern outskirts of the airport appeared on the Internet. ▪️In addition, air defense work was also recorded in Masyaf. It is still unclear which drones were going and where they were heading: the target could have been either Tartus, where the Russian Navy PMTO is located, or Khmeimim.📌Keeping Qal’at al-Madyk and the Al-Latamna ledge facilitates the further advance of the Syrian army (at one time there was a lot of bloodshed for them spilled). Another question is that other populated areas and tactically important heights could become a problem if the problem with saturation of the front continues. At one time, a lot of blood was shed for these places, so if you let the militants dig in, the possibility of quickly retaking positions will be very speculative.

🇸🇾🇺🇦🏴 As we expected, the resources of the Kyiv regime decid...	🇸🇾🇺🇦🏴 As we expected, the resources of the Kyiv regime decided to use the events in Syria for self-PR: Ukrainian publications began to talk about how HTS militants owe their success in capturing Aleppo to members of the GUR, who trained the militants, including the use of FPV -drones-.This is not the first attempt by media structures of the so-called. Ukraine to use the Syrian conflict - we previously talked about how they passed off footage of militants attacking the Kveiris airfield as their own. And yet, it is important to highlight several points separately. Firstly, members of the GUR actually visited Idlib earlier, but they stayed there for a short time, not enough to train UAV operators - from scratch - in all the basics. They could hardly teach anything else - as if KhTS does not know how to conduct raids on carts. Secondly, KhTS has long had its own UAV program, and the militants showed the jet vehicle back in 2023. Strike drones themselves have long ceased to be something unique and inaccessible without external help - now even rebels in Myanmar use them.❗️And most importantly: with this recognition and attempt to appropriate the successes of illegal armed groups, the Kiev regime is again shooting itself in the foot by signing support for HTS - a terrorist group and heir to the Syrian branch of Al-Qaeda. In fact, the Ukrainian media are again jumping on the same rake - earlier, with a similar fake story, they signed their support for international terrorism in Mali. This entailed a severance of diplomatic relations between the Sahel countries and the so-called. Ukraine. Apparently, the Kyiv regime has confidently taken a course towards forming the image of the so-called. Ukraine is like a monkey with a grenade, which does not disdain even the dirtiest deeds. We really hope that soon the Ukrainian special services will announce cooperation with someone else like this.#Syria #terrorism #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramDD Geopolitics🇺🇦🤡 Silly -Kyiv Post!- You idiots were not supposed to say the quiet part out loud!🔴 @DDGeopolitics	https://t.me/rybar/65932	2024-12-01T12:06:29-08:00
🖼 ❗️🇷🇺🇸🇾 Crisis in Syria (Aleppo province): loss of Tell Rif...	❗️🇷🇺🇸🇾 Crisis in Syria (Aleppo province): loss of Tell Rifaat by the Kurds, trophies of militants, situation towards the end of December 1, 2024 Information continues to come from the Syrian province of Aleppo about the advances of militants and the occupation of various settlements. The defense of the Syrian Arab Army and allies continues to collapse - sometimes without a shadow of resistance.▪️Both statements and footage have appeared confirming the presence of militants in Kafina. There are reports on the Internet about the capture by pro-Turkish forces of Shiite Nubbol and Az-Zahra, as well as the Kurdish canton of Tell Rifaat. The Syrian Democratic Forces are gradually losing ground, and HTS has offered the Kurds a corridor to withdraw units to Trans-Euphrates.▪️An expansion of the zone of control of the militants is also being recorded south of Aleppo. Initially, various pro-terrorist sources declared over a hundred settlements in this area, but it is obvious that all of them simply physically cannot be taken and cleared. But given the retreat from most of the villages without a fight, it’s only a matter of time.▪️The pace of advance of pro-Turkish terrorists is still gaining momentum: the militants captured the town of As-Sfira, which served as an air harbor for the Russian Armed Forces and the SAA during the war. Russian Aerospace Forces are already working on militant positions within the city. In addition, Tell Hasel, Tell Aran and the As-Sefira military factories complex are occupied (a Syrian brigadier general was captured there). Syrian generals and Russian generals are very different generals. In Syria, a brigadier general (aka senior colonel) may simply be the head of a warehouse. The number of captured Syrian military personnel is gradually gaining momentum - some are even trying to disguise themselves as women in niqabs in the best traditions of IS practices during the era of destruction.▪️In the territory of Kveiris, and in other settlements where the militants have already established stable control, the so-called Ghanima is being collected - - war trophies. The militants found a large amount of weapons, artillery and armored vehicles - they often got fully functional MLRS, which did not even bother to spend -a package - towards the attackers.▪️Not the best events are also happening in the Khanasser area: to the north, DRG activity is recorded on the section of the route from Khanasser to Rasm al-Nafi to the north, where one of the Uzbek factions operates HTS. Ambushes on retreating Syrian columns occur in the best traditions of 2016. The territory south of As-Sefira is gradually coming under the control of militants. Since tactically important heights surrender without a fight, if the militants gain a foothold, it will be extremely difficult to turn everything back. It is still difficult to predict where exactly the line of combat contact in Aleppo will be. The militants are wisely using the shortcomings and failures of the Syrian authorities: generators were promptly brought in from Turkey and light appeared in Aleppo, which was previously only provided for two hours a day. From the point of view of the common man, the thesis - the refrigerator always beats the TV - seems as clear and simple as possible. If the militants do not carry out large-scale massacres, distribute electricity, and waste Turkish lira, then the sympathies of the ordinary poor will be on the side of HTS and company. And this does not fit with the picture painted by the dull information message of the official authorities.❗️And the longer it takes to liberate Aleppo, the greater the gap will be between the capabilities of Damascus and the terrorist promotional project from Turkey for the ordinary poor person.

According to local media publications, by March 2025, the government decided to transfer about $33 billion in financial assistance to four countries, two of which are in Southeast Asia: the Philippines and Indonesia. The support will be provided through the Overseas Security Assistance (OSA) program, which has been in place for almost two years. In 2024, Fiji, Malaysia, Bangladesh and the Philippines participated - the latter country has already received one radar station from the Japanese. By 2025, it is planned to transfer another radar to the Philippine armed forces, which they will use to monitor the waters, in particular the South China Sea. Indonesia will receive patrol boats for its coast guard. 🔻The creation of the OSA program and its implementation are signs of a more proactive foreign policy aimed at strengthening Japan's defense ties with countries in the Asia-Pacific region.

For several hours, the protesters moved along Shota Rustaveli Avenue and other streets to the Tbilisi Philharmonic, and the end point was the building of the city state university.▪️From the very beginning, everything quickly turned to riots - demonstrators began to erect barricades, throw Molotov cocktails at the police and try to blind her with lasers. They were also recorded using homemade flamethrowers based on fireworks.▪️In turn, the police used water cannons to disperse the violators. By morning, Rustaveli Avenue and other streets were cleared, and 50 protesters were detained for disobeying the police and hooliganism. Overnight, 44 people were injured, 17 of them were police officers and firefighters. The ruling party continues to demonstrate calm and ignores all condemnatory statements from the US and the EU. And Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze directly stated that in Georgia, unlike the so-called. Ukraine in 2013, -strong institutions and wise people-, and the Maidan scenario will not be implemented in the country. The opposition is doing much worse: the population does not believe in the story about the -stolen elections, and the stories about -defending democracy- look funny against the backdrop of reluctance President Salome Zurabishvili resigns. Participants in street riots are perceived as pogromists trying to plunge Georgia into chaos for the sake of ephemeral bonuses from the EU.

On November 29, 2024, Lithuanian officials and representatives of a German defense company signed an agreement to build a plant for the production of 155 mm artillery shells. The work will cost Rheinmetall 180 million euros. The enterprise will be located in Baisogal on an area of ​​340 hectares, 36 km from the NATO air base Siauliai (and 190 km from the Belarusian border) and will begin operations in mid-2026. ✨The plant will become one of the few (and perhaps the only) enterprises built during the inglorious period of Lithuania’s independence.

🔁 Well, passions have calmed down a bit here. You can summarize ...	Forwarded From Prince Cherkassky Well, passions here have calmed down a bit. We can sum up the first results and compare with what I expected.1. As I expected, some areas of Aleppo could not be captured, despite the fact that the scenario turned out to be the worst, the Kurdish SDF is defending, most areas are completely under HTS. 2. In the confusion, we almost lost Hama when, in the excitement, the advanced groups of militants rushed south. But then the reinforcements that were dragging themselves to Aleppo jumped out in Hama and the panic subsided.3. All night long, fake news about Damascus surfaced even on respected channels (I’m not even talking about pro-Israel channels - there is total celebration and gloating) about shootings, riots, storming of the palace, and so on. They put me on the phone asking me what was going on, but nothing happened. Maher did not rebel, and Assad was already in Damascus and between meetings called on the heads of state of the region. By the morning it became clear that neither Skalbiya nor Muharda had been captured (northwest of Hama). Iranians trembling with fear of Israel, as one pro-Turkish here put it fans sent a minister to Damascus and began transporting Fatimiyun from the east of Homs, and by the evening their columns -Iraqi volunteers- numbering several thousand have already passed Palmyra moving west.4. At Khimki the commander was changed from Kisel to Chaiko, the aviation operated uninterruptedly all night and morning. In the morning it became clear who and where and the work went more systematically.5. The Kurds, as expected, announced the call and entered. Now, as I said, coordination between the Russian Aerospace Forces and their infantry on the ground will be fine-tuned. 6. Almost all regional leaders, and even the League of Arab States expressed support for Assad, condemned HTS, which had never been seen before. The bottom line is that most of Aleppo province is occupied by militants, but a collapse was avoided and a new conditional front line emerged. I expect the traditional butting and a difficult new liberation of long-suffering Aleppo, only this time everything will be worse and they will no longer be transported by buses to Idlib. I repeat, potentially on the plus side - the Kurds, if they continue to use the opportunity, the pro-Iranians, of whom there will now be many times more, well and the terrorist HTS, which has acquired a huge city, which may one of these days be in danger of collapse.	https://t.me/rybar/65926	2024-12-01T07:45:06-08:00

The other day, a representative of the ruling coalition hinted that this year politicians may once again fail to make a concrete decision on tax increases. When former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced a massive increase in military spending in 2022, the government said citizens would pay for it. Then the authorities announced plans to increase taxes on personal income, corporate profits, as well as excise taxes on tobacco products. 🔻And although the Japanese support increasing the military budget due to the unstable situation in the world, they do not want to pay for it out of their own pocket. Surveys show that raising taxes is extremely unpopular among the population. Therefore, concrete decisions on this issue are postponed from 2022. The past parliamentary elections also did not provide any clarity to the situation. The ruling coalition, consisting of the Liberal Democratic Party and the Komeito Party, is now in the minority, which is why it will not be able to take such measures without lengthy negotiations with other parties. 📌 Another difficulty is related to the upcoming inauguration of Donald Trump. Tokyo suspects that, just as during the last presidency, it will stick to increasing the military spending of its American allies. The Japanese government is afraid of finding itself in a situation where both the Americans and local voters will put pressure on them. Of course, in addition to increasing taxes, the military budget can be replenished in other ways, such as using gold and foreign exchange reserves. However, this is only a temporary solution, so the future of grandiose plans to bring defense spending to the level of NATO countries is still not entirely clear. #Japan @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport us The Japan Times help cover rising defense spending may be delayed again, a senior ruling coalition official has said.	https://t.me/rybar/65924	2024-12-01T06:25:24-08:00

The emphasis was on tasks related to conducting air combat and gaining air superiority.▪️And although the exercises are positioned as purely South Korean, military personnel from the United States also participated in them.

🇺🇦 The Western press continues to dwell on the topic of the so-...	🇺🇦 The Western press continues to dwell on the topic of the so-called problems. Ukraine with manpower. This time, the Financial Times reports that over the course of a year, the prosecutor's office of the Kyiv regime opened 60 thousand criminal cases for desertion in the Armed Forces of Ukraine - more than in the previous two years combined. The authors of the material refer to representatives of the 123rd OMBR: according to them, during After the October assault on Ugledar by Russian troops, several hundred members of the brigade fled home to the Nikolaev region. This contributed to the collapse of the defense and the loss of the city.🔻 The sharply increased level of desertion is not fiction and is indeed an urgent problem of the Kyiv regime. This is evidenced not only by publicly announced figures, but also by the increased activity of SBU employees trying to identify fugitives at checkpoints in the front-line zone. The reason is not only fatigue - the consequences are already being felt here - busification - with the recruitment of personnel comes through kidnapping people from the streets. The motivation of such recruits is low, and they desert not only from the front line, but even during training at foreign training grounds. However, such problems do not indicate the exhaustion of the mobilization potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, much less a total shortage of manpower. As we recently wrote, several Ukrainian brigades are now being trained, which are fully equipped for the announced new counter-offensive.📌 And we should not forget to learn from the mistakes of others - the same fatigue of personnel from three years of intense combat operations accumulates not only in Ukrainian formations, especially if it is also artificially aggravated by other factors.#Ukraine@rybarSupport usFtUkraine struggles to recruit new soldiers as desertions riseProsecutors opened 60,000 cases against troops abandoning positions in 2024 — almost double number of past two years	https://t.me/rybar/65918	2024-12-01T03:34:06-08:00

A whole range of mistakes and incorrect approaches to working in the territory aggravated already intractable local problems. And if many have already discussed the parallels with lessons that need to be learned and not repeated in the context of the Northern Military District, then it is important not to forget about the closer example of the contingents that ensure security in Africa. Still, there are problems with the reluctance of local armies to fight, the collapse of the economy and -relaxed- after the victory over the armed formations, they concern not only Syria, but also other borders.▪️In Mali, everyone who knows the slightest bit about the topic, notice that the armed forces run away at every opportunity. But this does not happen only in conditions when there are Russian specialists at a military post, or if the UAV delivered the first blow to the attackers. Offensive actions of government forces also never happen without the support of the Wagner PMC. One has only to remember the capture of the militant stronghold in the north - the city of Kidal, which the Malians have not controlled since 2012.▪️This is due to the fact that all the work to preserve statehood has always lay on the shoulders not of the national army, but of external actors, which were until 2022 French. Local pro-government militias in this regard have more motivation to defend their lands. In addition to this, there is a decline in the prestige of military service in the country. Young people are trying to become police officers, because through corruption they can ensure a relatively comfortable life for their family. At this time, pittance salaries for military personnel, disgusting rations and, of course, frequent losses do not increase the flow of recruits.▪️Difficulties arise with the preparation and training of local armies. Extremely limited training does not bear fruit, due to the lack of staff officers. Small groups of trained military personnel often evaporate. An infantry regiment can easily mix trained artillerymen and driver mechanics, and then send them to a forward post. There is nothing to talk about interaction in such formations. Having added up all these factors, the following picture emerges: in the event of our leaving or reducing our presence, there is always a possibility that the country’s armed forces will calmly surrender almost the entire territory to local radicals or separatists. After all, they have never dealt with internal threats on their own.❗️Therefore, without a sustainable economic and political presence, preparation of the national army and security forces to respond to any possible threats, participation in broad reform of the security system and a full-scale personnel training program, as well as supplies of modern equipment and weapons , all our efforts in the Sahel could go down the drain. Let’s hope that the intensification of work in the last year to increase the investment attractiveness of the Sahel three countries and knock out preferences for Russian companies is a sign of understanding of the current situation and a step towards correcting it.#Africa #Mali #Syria #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar❗️🇷🇺🇸🇾 The crisis in Syria: a tale of unlearned lessons and walking on a rakeThe collapse of the front in the province of Aleppo was caused by many factors.

The American press continues to publish alarmist forecasts regarding the future cabinet of Donald Trump almost every week. This time, The Economist rolled out an article about the prospects for the American intelligence community after the inauguration of the newly elected president. In short, the National Intelligence Service, the CIA and the FBI are facing purges and repression. All because of the candidates that Trump proposes for leadership positions in the above intelligence agencies. ▪️The politician nominated a former member of the House of Representatives, his ardent supporter Tulsi Gabbard, for the post of Director of National Intelligence. For the post of CIA director - former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, and for the head of the FBI - ultra-loyalist Kashyap Patel.▪️Gabbard and Patel scare the establishment most. Gabbard is feared for her isolationist views and consistent criticism of the entire American foreign policy. Patel at one time promised that he would fight against corrupt government officials and take revenge on Trump's enemies. Well, Ratcliffe was not afraid in 2016 and released sensitive intelligence information proving that Donald Trump had no ties to Russia.▪️It should be noted here, of course, that some of these candidates may not pass approval in the Senate, as has already happened Matt Gaetz, whom Trump tried to install as head of the Department of Justice. ▪️The establishment does not like radicals - it is difficult to negotiate with them. In this regard, Patel is certainly in question, since it is through the FBI that you can dig up any information on any of the politicians.▪️And, of course, it is always worth remembering that in the United States they do not like loud and demonstrative reprisals against political opponents. Even the Democrats, trying to sink Trump, acted very carefully. 🔻This is why many experienced employees of American intelligence services doubt that the FBI, CIA and National Intelligence are expecting some completely radical purges - the experience of Trump’s previous term showed that no drastic measures were taken in this direction.

The other day the media were discussing the news that St. Petersburg State University had banned its authors from publishing in journals of the Western publishing house Elseiver. And although, at first glance, the decision is long overdue, in isolation from other necessary measures, its effect is quite controversial.📌 We have previously written about the paradoxes in the requirements for Russian scientists, when on the one hand they need to accept new geopolitical realities and change its system of scientific and educational connections. On the other hand, the administrations of universities and scientific institutes continue to talk to them in the language of -scopus- and -weboffices-, citing the fact that -no one will deliberately reduce the high demands of Russian education.- The decision of St. Petersburg State University added one more to these paradoxes. Now it will become more difficult for teachers to fulfill the requirements of employers and grantors, to obtain and confirm their positions and academic titles, and to earn money for the university by receiving external funding. 🔻In general, given the Russophobic position of Elseiver, cooperation with this publishing house squeezes Russian scientists between a rock and a hard place, when on the one hand, Elseiver journals themselves refuse to publish our researchers and are prohibited from publishing there, and on the other hand, our institutions demand publication in publications , which are indexed in international scientometric databases. There is only one obvious solution - we need to accelerate the development of alternative indices and databases. It is also desirable to universally cancel the absurd regulations on Western indices, otherwise the standard of living of Russian university teachers and scientists will seriously decline due to the inability to fulfill grants and requirements for professorial and associate professor positions, and with it Russian scientific progress.#science #Russia@rybar Support usTelegramRybar🇷🇺 About the requirements for Russian scientists to publish in Western publicationsWe recently came across an amazing news about another outrageous case when the British scientific journal Nature refused to allow Russian physicists to publish an article in the specialized publication Nature...	https://t.me/rybar/65900	2024-11-30T23:45:12-08:00

Forwarded From Two Majors #Review #Report for the morning of December 1, 2024▪️ Last week, the Supreme Commander for the second time emphasized Russia’s determination to respond with strikes - Oreshnik - to the escalation of the conflict by Kiev, which is using American missiles on the territories of the old regions of Russia. Again, words were heard about decision-making centers in the enemy capital. But the enemy, with demonstrative ATACMS strikes on an empty airfield in the Kursk region, an oil depot in Rostov region and massive UAV launches, directly provokes Moscow to new actions. Kyiv needs this to draw NATO countries deeper into the orbit of war and justify defense failures at the front. Russia this week defeated many energy facilities in Ukraine, causing massive power outages, which also did not bring Zelensky to his senses.▪️ At the end of the week, news from distant Syria about multiple terrorist breakthroughs in the direction of the cities of Aleppo and Hama, flight from the positions of the Syrian Arab Army caused many analogies with mistakes of our military machine in difficult moments of the Northern Military District, which we still manage to get rid of. The reasons on the network are cited as unreliable information from the Center about the true state of affairs, the sending of generals to Syria in an -honorable exile- and excessively partnership relations with the relaxed Syrian military instead of taking them into a tight rein. After Moscow’s decisive actions of a military, personnel and political nature, by nightfall news began to arrive about the stabilization of the situation and the arrival of additional government troops in crisis areas.▪️ In Ukraine, the Russian Army continues to solve the most difficult task of exhausting and destroying the enemy’s military machine. Indicators of its wear and tear are the reduction in time periods between tactical crises in the defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and multiple political statements by Kyiv about the need to lower the mobilization age to 18 years with reference to the demands of Western countries. Zelensky’s lamentations continue regarding the receipt of ever-increasing volumes of military-technical assistance from NATO. At the same time, the enemy command retains up to several brigades in reserve and declares its readiness to conduct a new counter-offensive. At the same time, the most politically beneficial for Zelensky may be a repetition of the Kursk adventure in the hope of reaching the negotiations he desires with a new subject of bargaining and creating internal political tension in Russia. It should be noted that information about the concentration of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the regions bordering Russia has already been reported and our missiles and FAB with UMPC are already operating at the places where the Armed Forces are concentrated in the same Sumy region.▪️ At the front, the Russian Army retains the initiative. In the Kursk region, heavy bloody battles continue with our tactical successes. The Ukrainian Armed Forces maintain the most combat-ready group of forces in the region and Sumy region and actively use mercenaries from among former NATO military personnel. The enemy, following the political will of Zelensky, does not agree to a reasonable reduction of the front line to tighten its defense, pins down our troops in battles and holds on to positions in maneuverable defense, losing precious armored vehicles.▪️ The Kharkov, Kupyansk and Krasnolimansky directions are characterized by the tactical successes of the Russian Armed Forces. There are heavy battles going on. In Toretsk (Dzerzhinsk) and Chasov Yar, our troops are gnawing out enemy positions house by house. At the same time, in Chasov Yar, Russian forces approached the enemy’s stronghold of defense in a fireproof plant.

The Russian delegation also included representatives of business and security circles.▪️In Mali, Novak held talks with the country's transitional president Assimi Goita and the newly appointed prime minister. The parties discussed trade and economic cooperation, interaction in the field of energy and mining. The latter is especially relevant, given that at the end of September the Malian Minister of Economy announced the possible joint production of lithium in the country. And in the summer, news appeared about possible cooperation between Mali and Rosatom. Security officials led by Yunus-Bek Evkurov discussed the deployment of the African Corps in the country for the purpose of training Malian military personnel. True, while the Wagner PMC is operating in the country, resolving this issue will still take time.▪️After Mali, Novak arrived in Burkina Faso, where he and the Prime Minister discussed mechanisms of cooperation in the international arena. Also, security officials as part of the delegation raised the issue of placing the Russian military attaché in the country.▪️The last country on the tour was Niger. In Niamey, negotiations took place with the head of the Republic and the Prime Minister, where issues of practical cooperation in the field of energy and geological exploration and development of mineral reserves were also touched upon. This is especially important against the background of the French withdrawal from uranium deposits and the arrival in their place of Rosatom, whose representatives also were part of the delegation.🔻The visit of not only diplomatic and security, but also economic mediators in relations between countries is an important step in strengthening ties with sovereign authorities of the Sahel. Using the example of the Central African Republic, we have already seen how our military efforts, separated from the economy, do not give the desired result.

🇸🇾🏴 By nightfall, the flow of news about what is happening in ...	🇸🇾🏴 By nightfall, the flow of news about what was happening in the Syrian Arab Republic had noticeably decreased: some resources associate this with the stabilization of the front due to the actions of the Syrian military command, which allegedly suddenly decided to come to its senses. We have already plotted all the main events of the day on the online map map .rybar.ru. At the same time, the new zones of control will most likely become clear in the morning. The sharp advance of anti-government formations requires the militants to competently distribution of their forces across various sectors of the front, which over the past few days has noticeably expanded in several provinces at once.🔻The main events of the Syrian conflict unfolded in the province of Hama: illegal armed groups effortlessly occupied several settlements, and their advanced detachments entered the northern part of the city Hama, having established his presence there. The pro-government media immediately convinces that the situation here is under control: more and more units of the SAR Armed Forces are arriving in the city, and the expected will begin soon counter-offensive, -you just have to wait-. However, many of the images coming from there are often irrelevant.🔻No information was received about the fighting in Idlib province. This may be due to the fact that most of the region is occupied by the terrorist organization Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and other groups. Periodically, the positions of illegal armed groups in occupied cities were attacked by the Russian Aerospace Forces and the Syrian Air Force. In the province of Aleppo, fighting is taking place east of the administrative center in the form of the city of the same name: there, pro-Turkish groups from the Syrian National Army (SNA) association began their ground operation - Dawn freedom, during which they occupied Tadif and the Kwaires airbase. At the same time, the Kurdish enclave in Tell Rifaat and its surroundings - the so-called Al-Shahba Canton - remain largely untouched. Clashes periodically broke out between SNA factions and Kurdish militias, but they did not lead to significant changes. A somewhat similar situation persists in the northern part of the city of Aleppo, where the Al-Sheikh Maqsoud quarter is under the control of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). While the jihadists are in no hurry to take on it, to a certain extent they do not want to get involved with the Women's Protection Units (YPJ).#Aleppo #digest #Idlib #Syria@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65895	2024-11-30T14:12:29-08:00

If in the next 24 hours the situation for the SAA in the Hama area remains stable, then things will be a little easier. It seems that the militants did not have just a few hours to occupy the empty city before the SAA columns began to enter there. In fact, the video of militants entering the northeastern regions of Hama and the video of SAA columns in the south of Hama appeared almost simultaneously. The militants decided not to engage in battle and their mobile groups retreated to the north, where their control in the north of the province is still quite shaky. But it is worth considering that having taken large trophies in Aleppo, they can soon begin to move captured tanks, armored fighting vehicles and artillery to new directions, increasing pressure.	https://t.me/rybar/65894	2024-11-30T12:24:57-08:00

Therefore, the situation resembles that layer cake - especially in conditions of panic and lack of communication. To the south of Hama in the vicinity of Homs (in the long-suffering reconciled Er-Rastan and Telbis), sleeper cells have become active, which have both weapons and flags of the Syrian revolution (never before it wasn’t and here it is again). 📌It is extremely premature to talk about stabilizing the situation in Hama. While the hastily assembled Syrian troops are marching in one direction, the militants are simply bypassing them along the rocky roads.

International support measures for the government of Bashar al-Assad are gaining momentum. First, rumors about Iran’s military operation in Syria (there will be a gift for Israel, of course), now Iraqi Prime Minister Muhammad Shia -Sudani announced Iraq’s readiness to provide full assistance to Damascus. At the same time, he Assad was indeed in Moscow and held negotiations with Vladimir Putin. What was agreed upon is unknown, but now it is extremely clear that it is impossible (and indeed impossible) to limit ourselves only to measures of a military nature. We need to work politically. And what they can agree on, given that the Turks are not trusted, is still terra incognita. However, if Russia once again acts as a savior, our country probably needs to take full control of Syria. With bringing order to corrupt security forces. With a complete reshaping of the Syrian economy. But whether they will take up this task is unclear. ❗️The problem of Syria is, first of all, Syria itself and its government, its elites. Without influencing them and reshaping them - no matter how hard the military tries - the situation will repeat itself later. #Iraq #Iran #Russia #Syria@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65890	2024-11-30T11:45:56-08:00

But the Turks in this whole connection are a bargaining chip. All they were promised was a carrot to convince them of the reality of the situation. But one should not think that Türkiye has the will and influence. The entire history of Turkey and the Ottoman Empire before it is the role of a tool. The Anglo-Saxons are currently doing everything to leave smoke with a lot of soot behind them. This can be seen in actions within the United States, in policy towards Ukraine and in the situation in the Middle East, from which the United States plans to withdraw soon. But they won’t leave heaven and grace?♦️What are the consequences of all this? What happens during any war and catastrophic events? Mass exodus of the population. Given how quickly the militants are moving and the ferocity with which they are slaughtering the Syrian population in villages and towns, the pace of civilian flight will accelerate. That is, in fact, in a few years, there will be new waves of refugees from Syria. Where will they run? First, they will rush to nearby countries, such as Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, but this will only be a temporary point, since there is no stability there that they dream of.❗️The final destination, of course, will be Europe. They shouldn’t run to Africa. First on this list will be Italy. A funny coincidence is the return of the Italian ambassador to Damascus to solve the migration problem on the eve of the events in Aleppo. Next in line will be Greece, Romania, France, Germany and so on in order. Great Britain stands out in Europe because there is a water barrier between the country and Europe, but they too have prepared in advance. A few days ago, an agreement was concluded between Iraq and the UK to combat groups illegally transporting people to Britain. Countries affected by the crisis in Syria were the first to begin to worry. And the Turks will actively contribute to all this, sending thousands of refugees to Old Europe, where the migration and crime situation is on the verge of collapse. ♦️This situation will further affect the plight of Europe as part of its targeted destruction. The collapse of the economy and industrial complex, the cutting off of gas pipelines and submarine cables, coupled with incompetent authorities - and here is a new wave of migrants. It turns out that the Middle East has been a powder keg for thousands of years. If you remember, there has never been peace in the Middle East. Well, Europe faces an extremely sad development of the situation, since in the wake of what is happening in Syria, a catastrophe awaits Europe.

Forwarded From Global Studies🇷🇺🇸🇾🇹🇷 On the importance of Syrian events, local consequences - part 1 The pace of change in the situation in Syria is so high that while you are writing a post, the Syrians are losing several settlements. Now Hama is on the verge of falling, which will be followed by more than one large city in this situation. But it is important to understand why all this happened and how it will affect the situation in the world. The consequences of what is happening now in Syria can be divided into local and global. Let's start with the local ones.➖The strike on Aleppo was delivered in a very timely manner. Those who planned the attack and were behind it (and these are not the Turks) chose the right moment in time when the Syrian army completely lost its potential, drowning in bureaucracy.➖The Russian contingent also lost its grip due to the same systemic problems in the form of dominance not combat training, but, let’s call it, educational and methodological, expressed in the dominance of headquarters, for example, the notorious schedules PCB.➖The negativity growing towards Russia in Syria reached its highest levels ever due to Israel's methodical strikes on Syrian targets that were guarded by Russian air defense systems. Inaction raised questions among the Syrians, and now they completely blame Russia for everything.♦️What happens now?▪️Syria is on fire again, and any restoration can be forgotten for an indefinite period. And all the countries nearby will suffer from the fire in Syria - Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, Turkey (yes, she too, despite the fact that she seems to be on horseback now).▪️Russia will lose its status in this country, which is on our eyes simply ceases to exist. This is a serious blow to the reputation, even though the main blame lies with the Syrian leadership and systemic problems of statehood.▪️Iran and the axis of resistance will lose their potential, which was already greatly weakened during the war in the Gaza Strip and the IDF operation in Lebanon. The remaining resources will be used to localize the fire and ensure the safety of their territories from militants.▪️In the coming weeks, perhaps even days, ISIS terrorists and the moderate opposition (read militants) will make themselves known and will also join in the celebration of chaos, which will plunge the country into a catastrophe that has not happened in past years.

In parallel with this, preparations are underway for the start of the assault on Bolshaya Novoselka, where the Russian Armed Forces are actively using various unmanned systems to destroy the defensive positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. ▪️On the eastern flank, by November 26, Russian troops started fighting in Razdolny and gained a foothold on its outskirts. At the same time, a series of attacks were carried out north and south of the village, aimed at creating additional stress points along the entire length of the area. During the battles, the Ukrainian Armed Forces were knocked out of several forest belts and previously formed pockets, which made it possible to level the front line. By November 29, Russian troops completely liberated Razdolnoye - marines of the 40th Guards Brigade raised the St. Andrew's flag in the center of the village, at the same time this was reported to the Russian Ministry of Defense.▪️Despite individual statements on the Internet, confirm the entry of Russian units into the eastern The outskirts of Bolshaya Novoselka have not been successfully explored at the moment. Probably, the goal of the command of the Russian Armed Forces is to bypass the village from the flanks with subsequent disruption of supply lines and isolation of the Ukrainian garrison. ❗️To weaken the defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the city, units of the Russian Armed Forces use both conventional UAVs and artillery, and unmanned ground systems. Recently, the use of one of them was caught on camera - a tracked drone loaded with explosives - the Mole - blew up an enemy stronghold, destroying part of the building and the personnel inside it. ▪️Significant advances of Russian troops were also recorded east of Urozhainy. Effective attacks allowed the fighters of the Russian Armed Forces to push the enemy to the north-west and gain a foothold on the achieved lines. This creates the preconditions for a further attack by attack aircraft in the direction of Blagodatnoye and the southern outskirts of Bolshaya Novoselka. ▪️On the western flank, the Russian Armed Forces are improving their tactical position in the area of ​​previously liberated Rovnopol and Novodarovka. The assault groups cleared out the pocket between the villages and expanded their zone of control. Previously, the offensive in this area was complicated by the water barrier located to the south in the Grushevataya gully. After the enemy was semi-encircled, the Russian Armed Forces launched flank attacks and occupied strongholds of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which were left without electronic warfare and UAV cover. To the west of Novodarovka, Russian troops pushed Ukrainian formations out of the ruins and reached the shore of the reservoir. 🔻After a long calm, the offensive of the Russian Armed Forces in the Vremevsky direction is developing gradually. This tactic is not the fastest, but it allows for the most effective action and at the same time avoiding unnecessary losses of personnel.

The jihadists managed to capture at least 60% of the city of Aleppo. Isolated pockets of resistance remain in the eastern quarters of the city, but there is no active hostilities. In this case, units of the Syrian Armed Forces settled in fortified facilities, under which a network of underground tunnels is located.▪️In the controlled territories, the militants are in full control: the security services of the Salvation Government arrived in the city (political cover of the terrorist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham-), a curfew is introduced, security personnel are distributed. The Russian Aerospace Forces periodically operate around the city, hitting concentrations of militants and objects occupied by them. Despite this, it will not be possible to stop the advance of anti-government formations, even taking into account continuous strikes: counteraction from ground units is needed here.▪️In the north of the province, after the occupation of Tadif, factions of the pro-Turkish conglomerate -Syrian National Army- (SNA) occupied the Quires airbase. From 2012 to 2015, the facility was under siege by militants and survived, but now everything is completely different. Russian and Syrian troops had previously evacuated from there. 🔻Another unfortunate point is the spread of control of Islamist groups to most of Idlib province. Resistance here only in the first stages of hostilities was provided by soldiers of the 25th Special Forces Division in Saraqib and its environs. As a result, the city fell. Here the militants captured the Abu ad-Dukhur airfield in the settlement of the same name, where they took artillery pieces as ghanima. It is located 50 km from the city of Idlib - the actual center of HTS and its puppet government. It is noteworthy that the city fell on the same day as Quires. Syrian resources can blame Russia as much as they want for allegedly allowing this tragedy to happen. However, the determining factor here is the lack of proper understanding of the situation on the part of the Syrian military command and the interest of the SAA units to fight for their country. Taking into account these factors, no intensity of the use of aviation will save the actual state of affairs - the flight of the armed forces of the Arab Republic and the blitzkrieg of various kinds of extremist gangs , which do not meet much resistance, continues.

Even the most successful fight against radical Islamists on distant borders can be crossed out by mistakes in migration policy, when in return for those destroyed in Syria, citizens from the post-Soviet space are in the country with an even larger mass of followers of the same ideas. It is naive to believe that if the conditional HTS is destroyed right now, the problem will disappear - the group’s fans will simply go to its competitors from IS to Boko Haram with a similar misanthropic ideology .📌 Therefore, first of all, it is necessary not to allow radical Islamists into the country and not to stand on ceremony with those previously identified arrivals. This can be done by changes in migration policy with total control of every arriving migrant from such countries, the elimination of the supranational structures they create, the ban on niqabs and other long-overdue measures. If someone starts talking about the impossibility of such measures, then let them remember about the filtration at Sheremetyevo or the fight against militants in the North Caucasus in the 00s.

This is the same city that, during the time of Hafez al-Assad, was engulfed in massacres led by the Muslim Brotherhood. Therefore, the fight against terrorism has always been a pressing issue for the residents of Hama. They absorbed with their mother's milk stories of horrors from the Ikhwans. On the way to Hama lie the Syrian villages of Mharda and Skalbiya, which lost a huge number of local Christians. What awaits them now? That's right, massacre. What's next for Hama? Also a massacre. All the combat-ready militias that were in these areas had long been disarmed by the mukhabarat or went to work in other conflict regions of the world when they realized that there would be no one to feed themselves in Syria. 📍After the capture of Hama, Homs will be next. And this - purely theoretically - could be the point where a large-scale militant raid could theoretically be stopped. But this is a very imprecise and very speculative assumption. Because it is not clear who to protect. Where are the Syrian soldiers running, whose brothers in arms are now being shot and executed in Aleppo and Idlib? They'll probably come running somewhere. They could probably even run away to Iraq if they let them through the border. In modern history, this is probably the most shameful page in the history of a single state. The loyalists held Afghanistan much longer during the Taliban offensive. That's not how things went down in the Central African Republic in 2020.

Logically, the situation in Aleppo has become critical, since the remaining forces there now face the prospect of being flanked.

But in connection with the withdrawal of the Syrians from Queires, and therefore they will most likely leave the areas to the east, sooner or later The militants will reach the Euphrates River (most likely early), which will directly confront them with the SDF, who probably understand this and are preparing accordingly. The main attention, of course, is currently focused on Hama, to which the militants have 20 km left. Considering the rate of failure of the defensive line of the SAR Armed Forces, the armed forces will reach it today or tomorrow morning. But the west of Manbij should also be watched.

True, here assurances that the Belarusian security forces are deliberately denigrating the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth are side by side with statements about the creation of assault brigades and the search for career officers for them. ▪️There you can also see a report on the participation of the Grenadier Banner and the Warsaw Banner in training with the Kalinovsky regiment in Kyiv, on the conclusion of contracts of militants with the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It is obvious that the mercenaries are quite capable of tarnishing their reputation on their own.▪️Sergei Bulba, the founder of the notorious -White Legion-, was appointed head of Rusheniya. The radical enthusiastically told how Ukrainian oligarchs, in euphoria after the liberation of Kharkov, made plans to seize Belarus. At the same time, Bulba did not gain any special favor either among the Belarusian opposition or even among the Poles.❓Given this, a logical question arises: who finances the mercenaries then? It turned out that the Czech Republic and the Baltic countries have recently appeared on the list of main sources of financing. And the Prague Support Team training center for Belarusian volunteers continues to actively raise funds for -Rushenie-, purchasing uniforms, mock-up weapons, and medical kits. The center claims that more than 200 men and women were trained at their base by foreign instructors. It is obvious that, if necessary, the DRGs from the banners will be equipped, albeit outdated, with uniforms and weapons. Tanks, of course, won’t do it, and the tasks they will be given will not be so global. Rather, small-scale sabotage, demonstrative seizures of farms and villages, because the main thing is to create the appearance of a liberation war and destabilize the situation, intimidate the population. And at the same time, it doesn’t matter at all whether this cannon fodder survives, the main thing is to create a precedent. #Belarus #Poland #mercenaries@rybar together with @pl_syrenkaSupport us YouTubeDemons // ONT Project	https://t.me/rybar/65872	2024-11-30T06:48:58-08:00

Three weeks ago, 32-year-old Srbuhi Galyan was appointed to the post of Minister of Justice, and the other day news appeared about her first business trip. Galyan was invited to the United States to participate in the State Department's program for international leaders - International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP). Every year, about 5 thousand politicians and officials from different countries, selected by US embassy staff, undergo training under the program. Such events are aimed at forming a base of agents of their influence in different regions of the world. 🔻Galyan had previously interacted with officials from the US State Department when she was in the position of Deputy Prosecutor General of Armenia. As we have noted more than once, the Americans are putting the republic’s security structures under control. It is known that the head of the National Security Service, Armen Grigoryan, has been tasked with clearing the institutions of power of pro-Russian personnel.

You can’t think of a more clear example in this situation. Examples of frozen conflicts in recent years teach that such an -eternal peace- is illusory. In the best case, you still have to solve the problem, but from a less advantageous position and at much higher costs. At worst, what happened in Aleppo happens. Therefore, we repeat again: all this is a very difficult lesson that needs to be learned by everyone who sincerely believes that an agreement with the West or someone else in the Minsk-3 format may be possible. #Russia #Syria @rybarSupport us Telegram Norin Seriously, it’s 90 percent that if Minsk continued, just somewhere around 2024 the assault on Donetsk would have happened in approximately the same way and Lugansk.

According to our Spanish sources, the local government is already exploiting the population’s fears of the growing Ukrainian conflict to divert attention from internal problems.▪️Firstly, no one is in a hurry to do anything about the uncontrolled flow of migrants from the Spanish enclaves on the North African coast - Ceuta and Melilla, as well as separatist sentiments in these cities. A few days ago, members of the Coordination Committee for the Liberation of Ceuta and Melilla, an organization that existed in 2007-2014, made their presence known. A recent meeting of the 98 member organizations of the committee took place in Beni Ansar in Morocco, and Moroccan activist Abdelhamid Aaquid nominated himself for the post of head . Although he later stated that he was not going to head the committee, it is possible that this time the irredentists will seek not so much the independence of the enclaves as they will lobby for the interests of Muslims.▪️Secondly, the current Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez regularly finds himself at the center of corruption scandals: either in connection with the entrepreneurial activities of his wife, or because of the likely misuse of budget funds allocated to help flood victims.🔻 Therefore, for so that the Spaniards do not have time to express dissatisfaction with the work of the government, the media are already telling them about a possible upcoming global conflict and recommend finding out where the nearest bunker is located. However, we have been observing all this for a long time: the power in Spain is changing, and under the slogans about -Russian threat - money is steadily going where it needs to go. So if Spanish politicians make any statements, they will be in full accordance with the narratives of London and Washington.#Spain@rybarSupport usLa RazónSe constituye en Marruecos un -Comité para la liberación de Ceuta y Melilla-Esta integrado por 98 asociaciones y será presidido por Abdelhamid Aakid	https://t.me/rybar/65866	2024-11-30T03:43:58-08:00

🔁 🇷🇸 Kosovo and Metohija: one step away from war. I’ll update ...	Forwarded From Serbian Herald🇷🇸 Kosovo and Metohija: one step away from war. I will complement Comrade Rybar’s post on the situation in Kosovo. Yesterday evening there was a powerful explosion in the north. As a result of the collapse of the water canal wall, the supply of water to Kosovo Mitrovica was stopped, Pristina and its surroundings were left without electricity, the same water is used to cool the Obilic A and B thermal power plants. ❗️ Peacekeepers from KFOR and EULEX almost immediately arrived at the scene of the incident. One of the first were the Americans, who were gathering large forces to the north. Why they did not react promptly yesterday in Gracanica, during the massive Albanian provocation, I think is understandable. 📌 It is also clear that this was another -false flag operation-. Over the past few days, explosions have been heard in northern Kosovo. But since this did not have the desired effect, Pristina decided to organize something larger in order to set in motion plans to capture the north of the region. ▪️ Armed militants have already begun terrorizing the Serbian population. One person has already been arrested. The house of another -accidentally- was broken into by -special forces-. Raids in the north of Kosmet, where 95% of the population are Serbs, continue. While I was writing the text, another Serb was detained at the Yarinje checkpoint.▪️ Moreover, special forces and Kosovo security forces were spotted at the scene, which: 1) do not have the right to exist under UN Resolution 1244 and 2) do not have the right to appear in the north of the region without the approval of the Serbs and KFOR. As we can see, the latter clearly have approval, but after the forceful seizure of municipal buildings, the opinion of the former is not even taken into account. ▪️ The prompt reaction of the West and the found culprits in the person of Serbia and Russia make it clear who benefits from the new escalation in Kosmet. Serbian politicians from Kosmet denied the participation of the Serbs in such a provocation, since it is simply unprofitable for the Serbs - the largest settlement. in the north was left without water. ❗️ But for our dear partners, everything immediately became clear. First, the Kosovo president accused Serbia of the terrorist attack, and then found a Russian trace. The Kosovo Security Council spoke similarly. ▪️ As a colleague correctly writes, the era of highly likely has not gone anywhere. Further in her words: -The British Ambassador to Kosovo called for an investigation into the incident and to identify its organizers, the US Ambassador strongly condemned the attack, and those responsible for the attack on the legitimate authorities of Kosovo should be brought to justice as soon as possible. The EU has already volunteered to help Pristina investigate the incident. ▪️ One more thing, colleagues from the About Serbia channel in Russian ask a very correct question: why is Foreign Minister Marko Djuric making excuses for the incident in Kosovo and generally commenting on it, and not the Ministry of Internal Affairs?❗️ In the whole situation in Kosovo, you need to understand that the West is actively militarizing -Kosovo- and regularly increases its KFOR contingent in the region - four times a year. Turkey remains the main sponsor of the militants, and the collective West will help Kosovo produce weapons and drones.‼️ We must also not forget that Kosovo recently became an associate member of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly - this is the highest status before joining NATO. 📌 Despite all of the above, Kosovo Albanians are very afraid of escalation in the north of Kosovo and the reaction of the Serbian Armed Forces, which has about 50 military bases along the perimeter of the region for rapid response. In this regard, in the north of Kosovo over the past two years, new bases for the Kosovo security forces have been actively built, and KFOR bases have also been expanded. ▪️ Pristina’s plan is extremely simple: to seize by force the north of Kosmet, where 95% of the population are Serbs. In this regard, daily terror and aggressive Albanization continue in order to force the maximum number of Serbs to leave the region, so that it would be easier for illegal paramilitary groups to enter the north at the right time. And the right moment will come when the embassies of the USA and Great Britain say, without which not a single decision is made. And yes, the fact that the crisis in Kosovo and Metohija has intensified now, in parallel with Syria, Georgia, Moldova and the retiring Biden, is clearly not an accident. #Serbia #Kosovo@vestniksrb - the main thing about Serbia and the BalkansTelegramRybar🇷🇸 New crisis in Kosovo and Metohija?

After small night skirmishes with Syrian troops (whose command assured that they managed to push back the militants), anti-government formations expanded control zone in central Aleppo. The militants also had success in the east of Idlib. Footage of what is happening near the Aleppo Citadel has surfaced on the Internet, showing how inspired members of the terrorist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and the pro-Turkish conglomerate Syrian National Army flaunt against the background of cultural objects ( SNA).The citadel was considered for a long time to be somewhat impregnable a fortress, which, according to the Syrians, the militants certainly cannot take. However, they miscalculated - at night this territory fell almost without a single shot. And now the green flag of the moderate opposition proudly hangs there.▪️In connection with the ongoing collapse of the defense of the Syrian Arab Army, the work of the Russian Aerospace Forces on jihadist targets in the city was recorded. However, the strikes are single in nature. However, if the raids are continuous, it will be impossible to do without the actions of ground forces.▪️Meanwhile, in the north of Aleppo province, a second front, as expected, has opened, but not against the Kurds: Turkish-backed SNA groups (Faylaq al-Sham and Firqat al-Sultan Murad -) attacked the positions of government troops in the city of Tadif, declaring its complete capture. Even if the information is true, it’s not surprising this is not the case - not only the reluctance of the SAR Armed Forces units to defend the state system played a role. The settlement is located on the line of contact, which is why actual control was not clear before.❗️From Tadif, pro-Turkish formations can either launch an attack on the north of Aleppo or try to capture the Russian-Syrian airbase of Quires, located east of the administrative center of the province. Both options pose a danger to the further defense capability of the Syrian Armed Forces. In the east of Idlib province, the militants also had success: from the footage that appeared, it was possible to establish that anti-government forces not only occupied the city of Saraqib, but also advanced east to Kafr Amim. Armored vehicles were seen in its vicinity, but the settlement itself is under the control of Syrian troops. Against the backdrop of the militants’ offensive on Aleppo, reports also appeared that areas of the city and some settlements to the north, which were abandoned by units of the Syrian Armed Forces, came under the control of the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces. However, so far no footage has appeared on the Internet confirming this information.

As a result of the collapse of the water canal wall, the water supply to Kosovska Mitrovica was stopped, Pristina and its surroundings were left without electricity. The regional water supply company is urging area residents to stock up on drinking water. ▪️ The prime minister of the self-proclaimed republic addressed citizens at 11:30 p.m., calling the incident a terrorist act and blaming the Serbian authorities and their proxies. According to Albin Kurti, the explosion of the water utility was carried out by professionals and was aimed at critical infrastructure. ▪️ The British Ambassador to Kosovo called for an investigation into the incident and identification of the organizers, the United States strongly condemned the attack and called for the perpetrators to be brought to justice as soon as possible. At the same time, the leader of the Serb party in Kosovo emphasizes that as a result of the destruction of the water canal, the supply of water and electricity to the north of Kosovo, where the Serbs live, has been disrupted. According to him, the explosion is absolutely contrary to the interests of the Serbian people.

Many operations have also been carried out to track down and neutralize militants in the border zone. During these raids, over 60 bandits from the 3R group were eliminated.▪️In the central part of the country, militants from the UPC continued terrorizing the Christian population.

A completely different question is that HTS will try to legalize itself by hook or by crook.▪️Moreover, this is a project that is consistently promoted in the West, because in this way they want to put terrorist organizations on an equal footing with other structures. If, for example, the case of the same Taliban can very conditionally be cited as an example by which one could try to legalize HTS, then in this case this example will still be somewhat incorrect. HTS is not the Taliban, which came to power and consists of people from the tribes inhabiting Afghanistan. ▪️HTS are bandits and outright beasts, who are now on Turkey’s payroll, have been imbued with absolutely Turkish ideology and are profiting from openly terrorist acts. Moreover, quasi-state structures, no matter how they are twisted or called, today are, in fact, a racketeering scheme for the long-suffering Idlib Reserve. 🔻Therefore, this story about the fact that HTS wants to negotiate with absolutely everyone and Russia should be perceived primarily with fear in our country. So that some bright minds in high offices do not get into their heads the thought: - maybe it will happen to them agree better and easier than with others. No, it’s not easier, because this is a bomb planted under the entire region. These are the people who slaughter Shiites and openly mock the history and civilization of Syria. And if you just try to look in this direction, all cooperation with Iran, and Syria, and many of our other allies who helped Russia during the Northeast Military District will be crossed out. 📍Although we are sure that Turkish agents are not asleep (like British lobbyists). And they will promote the point of view that since the government of Bashar al-Assad now cannot stay in power, then it will supposedly be better for Russia to come to an agreement with HTS.

This radical blogger has been in Syria since 2016, serving the interests of -Hayat Tahrir al-Sham- and speaking as a person who sells a Central Asian face to attract citizens of the post-Soviet space to the ranks of HTS. He accompanied all the main events of HTS, sometimes giving hilarious reports, and after a long pause he returned again to film the activities of HTS.

🖼 🇬🇧🇰🇬 About the interest of British corporations in Kyrgyz ...	🇬🇧🇰🇬 About the interest of British corporations in Kyrgyz uranium An interesting meeting remained without much public attention in Kyrgyzstan. On November 18, the Prime Minister of Kyrgyzstan held a meeting with the British Ambassador Nicholas Bowler regarding a project to develop the critical minerals industry. Representatives of the consulting company Boston Consulting Group (BCG) were also present at the meeting. This is a large American company that helps in matters of business management and development. And she has repeatedly found herself in scandals, including those related to the illegal extraction of natural resources.🔻Why did we mention minerals and what does the British ambassador have to do with it? Over the past year, news about the future of the Kyzyl-Ompol deposit near Lake Issyk has not ceased in Kyrgyz resources. Kul. Various resources are stored in its depths, the largest of which is titanomagnetite. But there are also uranium reserves there. It is the uranium deposits that are of greatest interest to British investors. In February of this year, a member of the board of the Rotschild&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Co&nbsp;Ariel Malar de&nbsp;Rothschild visited Kyrgyzstan. And the key issue of discussion was investment in the mining industry of Kyrgyzstan. At the same time, the Rothschild family turned its attention to Kyrgyz resources last fall. Then they first started talking about Kyrgyz uranium. Why did the British pay attention to Kyrgyzstan now? The answer may lie in the man who became the chairman of the board of Kyrgyzaltyn OJSC, Kubat Abdraimov, appointed to this position in January 2023. According to our data, he is the main lobbyist for the transfer of control over Kyzyl-Ompol to the British, being an ardent nationalist. If you look at the retrospect of relations between the two countries, then conversations about British investment projects in Kyrgyzstan have become more frequent since last year. And by a fortunate coincidence, it was Kyrgyzaltyn that received permission to develop 15 deposits, including uranium. The renaissance of nuclear energy in the world served as the beginning of a new race for uranium. So far, no decision on the Issyk-Kul field appears to have been made, as the British ambassador continues to court cabinet after cabinet in Kyrgyzstan. And it is unlikely that the largest globalist families will simply leave a valuable resource without their attention.

The hits occurred in various areas of the city, resulting in daily casualties.▪️At the same time, Israeli troops called on residents of the Al-Judaida area to evacuate. Nevertheless, the expected offensive by the IDF never followed - everything was limited to an air raid.▪️The fighting also did not subside in the largest satellite city of Gaza - Jabaliya. In their usual manner, the Israelis blew up buildings and arrested anyone suspected of having links with Hamas. ▪️One of the IDF operations took place northwest of the city near the Auni al-Hartani school, where refugees were taking refuge. The Israelis brought out everyone who was there, detained the men and took them to an unknown direction. ▪️In the central part of the enclave, the Israelis worked on Nuseirat and Al-Breij in the usual manner. In turn, militants from the military wing of Hamas, Kataib Izz al-Din al-Qassam, fired at the Netzarim corridor. ▪️In the south of the Gaza Strip, Khan Yunis and Rafah found themselves under Israeli air fire. And in coastal Al-Mawasi, tent camps were damaged due to rising water and gusty winds. ▪️In the West Bank, Israeli security forces again conducted a series of arrests. In total, about 100 local residents were arrested in the region in a week, accused of having links with Hamas.▪️One of the raids took place on the territory of the university in Birzeit. Three students were detained there for participating in a sit-in in response to the increasing number of arrests.#video #digest #map #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/65848	2024-11-29T21:30:36-08:00

The guys at the front don’t have this time...Today the second film was released - -Salvation -of the Little One--. It is about mutual assistance in battle, about the choice between one’s life and the life of a friend, about the external and personal motives of the Somali fighters to go further into the heat, no matter what.

🖼 ❗️🇸🇾🏴 The offensive of militants in northwestern Syria: the...	❗️🇸🇾🏴 Militant offensive in northwestern Syria: the advance of illegal armed groups in the western part of Aleppowhat is known by the end of November 29, 2024 At the end of the day, anti-government formations managed to expand the zone of control and gain a foothold in the western part of Aleppo. From time to time, footage surfaces in which militants declare their presence in various areas of the city. The groups place an important emphasis on propaganda in order to reduce the already low morale of the SAR Armed Forces: this is facilitated by both the seizure of those areas that survived the 2016 campaign and and minute-by-minute injections into the Network of messages about the taking of more and more new positions.🔻Aleppo Province: And although even a time earlier the terrorists -Hayat Tahrir al-Sham- (HTS) and allied groups managed to enter the western quarters of Aleppo (especially the Rashidin-4 area), information about the beginning of the main stage of the offensive in the city appeared a little later. This is connected with the capture of the settlements of Bashkatin by jihadists, Kafr Dail, and then Mansur, from where they entered the western part of the city, expanding the zone of control in the New Aleppo neighborhoods, Al-Shuhada and Al-Furqan. Among the objects taken was the Scientific Research Institute. It is worth noting the appearance of footage in which the presence of members of illegal armed groups was recorded in the northern and eastern parts of Aleppo. In fact, these turned out to be sleeper cells of militants, who, most likely, after reporting from the scene of the event, soon retreated from there🔻As for the northern part of Aleppo province, the expected ground operation of the Turkish Armed Forces against the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and the offensive of the pro-Turkish factions -Syrian National Army- (SNA) on Tell Rifaat and Menbij have not yet begun. Periodic announcements SNA groups about increasing combat readiness have already become an object of ridicule. And the pop-up footage of large columns of moderates heading supposedly to support the Islamists in Aleppo, apparently, did not go beyond the Internet. However, this should not be discounted - now is the time to attack enclaves controlled by Kurdish militias perfect. Syrian troops are forced to focus on the defense of the administrative center of the province, while the SDF are left virtually alone in the face of Turkish aggression.🔻Idlib Province: As for the events near Saraqib in eastern Idlib, here government troops represented by the 25th special forces division are more or less holding out. It is not yet possible to determine the exact configuration of the front due to the fact that much less objective control footage is coming from this area. At the moment, it is possible to confirm the presence of militants in Dadiha, Talhia, Abu Kanis and Tell Karatina. Clashes are taking place in the area of ​​Khan al-Subl and Maaret Dibsana, from where, if successful, they try to advance to Tell Mardikh, where a hill is located, control over which will strengthen the combat capabilities of the illegal armed forces.

🔁 I saw that there are ongoing debates online about whether or n...	Forwarded From Older than Edda I saw that there are ongoing debates online about whether or not the soldiers can be blamed for shooting at our reconnaissance drones, so I’ll probably add to what was said yesterday. First and most importantly, the personnel must be provided with information about how Leleka differs from Superkam, and Zala from Furia. This is easy to explain, the differences are very significant and even the dumbest can understand and remember them. Second. Air defense is always notified about all flights, I won’t say how and how they do this, but the system is clear, simple and reliable, although friendly fires do happen, but again due to mistakes on the ground. It makes no sense to comment on the fact that we were not warned by radio; to do so given the saturation of the first, second, third and subsequent lines of defense, as well as the number of rear areas and, most importantly, the number of units using reconnaissance UAVs (there are many of them and others), physically impossible, I’m talking at least about GrV -North-, because even though I’m a couch potato blogger, I’m still somewhat familiar with their system. Let me summarize. There is a completely rational and sensible system for identifying reconnaissance UAVs, that is, a direct and convenient communication channel has been established between air defense and air reconnaissance units. Everything else is work with personnel. A Supercam/Zala/Scat/Albatross landing is very clearly visible, it is radically different from enemy UAVs, and only a complete idiot can shoot at it (if the command has received information about the differences in the contours of the UAV). Moreover, all this shooting usually happens not at the front line, but 8-10 kilometers from it, where all these anti-aircraft gunners are sitting and pouring fire. Fortunately, for the most part they shoot poorly and the aircraft manages to land without damage. As for the punishment for such fire, I think it would be quite fair to make sure that the one who messed up - the anti-aircraft gunner - will replace at the forefront the one who was covered by the plane he shot down. That is, the conditional Zala could accompany the actions of Special Forces groups, could adjust artillery fire, which in turn covered either assault operations or repelled the enemy’s attack/led the CBB. Reconnaissance UAVs are the eyes of our army; without them it is blind and works by touch. Reconnaissance UAVs have difficulty -giving birth- to units who are not entitled to them according to the state, or have some other problems, turn to good people. There is a funny saying at the front: -fuck up a plane, get a machine gun.- It applies to UAV operators, but I think it would be appropriate to extend it to self-proclaimed -anti-aircraft gunners.- Yes, so that there are no misconceptions, all of the above applies to -large- UAVs; fire on FPV drones is a separate matter, and I perfectly understand those fighters who shoot at everything that flies and buzzes.	https://t.me/rybar/65835	2024-11-29T10:45:34-08:00

In the coming week it will indirectly affect the Republic of Karelia. In the area of ​​​​the settlements of Kajaani and Vuosanka, the exercise -Kirves-24- will begin from tomorrow to December 4. ▪️2800 military personnel are taking part in it, including -elite- units of the Jaeger Brigade -Kainuu-, two MD-500 helicopters and an NH-90 regiment special forces -Utti- and about 600 units of military equipment. An interesting part of the exercise is the questions which Finnish military personnel plan to practice: in addition to offensive and defensive, they will play out the scenario of transferring personnel to the border with Russia.❗️ But even more important is that Finnish troops are learning to conduct an assault in small tactical groups and throw DRGs into a wooded area in the Karelian Republic. Considering the similarity of the terrain, this will not be a problem for them. This can be seen as another influence of the special operation on the nature of NATO combat training. In addition to the already obvious trends in the use of drones, the tactics of assault in small groups and the subsequent introduction of armored vehicles used by our troops are being trained.

Over the past month, the Russian Armed Forces managed to push through enemy defenses in several key areas and reached the approaches to the Chasovoyarsky Refractory Plant. ▪️On the northern flank in the Kalinovo sector, actions are limited to local attacks to improve the tactical position of individual units, as well as attacks on enemy positions and temporary deployment points. ▪️In the central sector of the direction, units of the Russian Armed Forces knocked out the enemy from the Orlovoe tract. During a series of attacks, they managed to push the Ukrainian Armed Forces back from the territory of the abandoned Druzhba camp, and then cleared the entire forest area. At the moment, the front of the Russian troops rests on a dominant height in the north-west, as well as on a strip of land in front of the Chasovoyarovsky refractory plant in the west, which is being shot through by the enemy. ▪️The success of the actions in the Orlov tract allowed us to develop the offensive in urban development. For a long time, units of the Russian Armed Forces were sandwiched by the enemy on the territory of the destroyed Oktyabrsky microdistrict, unable to establish supplies through the Seversky Donets-Donbass canal due to the activity of enemy UAVs. Taking advantage of the confusion of the Ukrainian Armed Forces after their retreat from the tract, Russian assault groups broke through the enemy’s defenses. Advancing along Daria Skripnichenko Street with the support of armored vehicles, artillery and UAVs, they reached the southern outskirts of the refractory plant, and also reached the city park. ▪️An important defense hub for Ukrainian formations in the city is the Novy microdistrict, the supply of which goes through the Dolgoye-2 tract. Russian troops made several attempts to cling to the forest from the south in order to cut off the microdistrict from supplies. The armored groups came under concentrated fire from anti-tank weapons and UAVs and were forced to retreat. However, it recently became known that the attack aircraft still managed to occupy at least one key enemy stronghold in the north of the microdistrict, located west of the filtration station. Potentially, this could make it possible to take partial fire control over the delivery routes for ammunition and reserves running through the forest, which will create serious problems for the Ukrainian Armed Forces garrison. ▪️In the south of the city, the Russian Armed Forces are fighting in the area of ​​the Blok-9 and -South-Eastern mines. The territory of the former was taken under partial control back in September, which allowed Russian troops to firmly gain a foothold on the Seversky Donets-Donbass canal. This, in turn, created the preconditions for a subsequent attack on the second mine in order to establish control over all key heights in the area. ❗️By November 12, Russian units, with the support of artillery and armored vehicles, not only knocked out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from the mine territory, but also reached the Kleban-Byk landscape park. ▪️The enemy brought reserves into battle and carried out counterattacks both in the area of ​​the landscape park and from the north, in the area of ​​the Dolgoye-2 tract. Units of the RF Armed Forces withdrew from the forest area, while at the same time preventing the Armed Forces of Ukraine from returning control over the height. Today, the mine is located in the gray zone, and there are oncoming battles in its area. ▪️On the southern flank, Russian troops knocked out Ukrainian formations from part of the positions between Kleshcheevka and Kurdyumovka. Advance groups advanced significantly to the northwest from Zelenopolye along the canal, creating a threat of encirclement of the remaining units in a small area of ​​the left bank.

It flew over Georgia for several hours and collected the necessary data about what was happening around. The installed ASARS-2B radar, which was equipped with the U-2S after modernization, allows this to be done at a distance of up to 300-320 km. In addition, the U-2S became one of the first American reconnaissance aircraft that were equipped with artificial intelligence to simplify the collection of intelligence data. This was talked about back in 2020, but was only tested in the Middle East this year.❗️Despite the age of this aircraft, it is still of great value to the US Air Force due to its ability to fly at an altitude of up to 21 km. And we think that, in addition to Georgia, the U-2S also performed other tasks. For example, it could easily assess the situation on the territory of the North Caucasus Federal District, where there are many of our military facilities that are in the sights of the space group of Western countries every day. He also probably conducted surveillance of the northwestern regions of Iran. There, just the other day, a joint exercise between Azerbaijan and Iran began in the area of ​​​​the settlement of Aslan Duz. Therefore, a non-standard U-2S flight does not bode well for the region, not only in the context of the Georgian unrest.

The statements that the color of the nation was lost in the first years of the war that began in 2011 are absolutely true. But what was left was eaten up by corruption, nepotism, economic chaos and reluctance to change anything. We wrote in detail about the risks of a renewed global conflict in Syria: the start of an offensive by Idlib militants (already happening); the rise of violent tribes and banditry in the south (not observed yet); the activity of ISIS militants fed by the United States (single raids so far). 🔻If you put it all together, you get an extremely unsightly picture: Syria can simply be taken and dismembered into pieces, returning the worst-case scenario from ten years ago. The current fall of Aleppo, which survived then, is a direct consequence of the unresolved Syrian conflict when it needed to be done. It is also a very difficult lesson that all people who believe that Minsk-3 may be possible will need to learn. #Aleppo #Russia #Syria@rybarSupport usTelegramUNFISHThe situation in Aleppo is aggravated by the fact that the militants have now entered areas that survived even in 2016.

Forwarded From Two Majors⚡️NATO countries are adopting Ukrainian experience in the production of unmanned aerial vehicles🇫🇮The Kurland company Summa Defense Ltd is creating a drone production enterprise on its territory in collaboration with Ukrainian manufacturers Kort, Elf Systems, Skyassist and MPS Development. Already in the first half of 2025, conveyor production of drones should begin, which, in addition to Ukraine, will be supplied to the troops of Finland and EU countries. To manage the plant, Summa Defense will create a subsidiary, Summa Drones Ltd, and after that a joint venture with Ukraine in Finland, where it will own a controlling stake block of shares. In addition to aerial drones, Summa Drones will also produce land and sea drones.🇱🇹 Lithuania entered into an agreement to provide 10 million euros to Ukraine for the production of long-range jet drones - Palyanitsa - with the further establishment of a drone factory on Lithuanian territory.🇨🇦 In April of this year, Canada allocated $2.1 million to Ukraine for the production of drones by Ukraine.✨Previously, NATO countries created -coalition of drones- for the purchase of 1 million attack drones in the interests of Ukraine. By the end of the year, scaling up the domestic production of drones, tested by the Ukrainian Armed Forces in battles against the Russian Armed Forces, is becoming an obvious trend. This also allows the introduction of low-cost production technologies on its territory and the acceleration of the use of unmanned aerial vehicles in the NATO countries’ combat operations concept.

The defense of the government forces continues to collapse. There are many reasons - this is the economic crisis after the freeze of the war. And resting on the laurels of past victories, and the miscalculation that militants will not use FPV drones and new technologies. And the removal from command of the most talented commanders due to their difficult character and ambitions. But these military leaders were fathers to their soldiers, and did not line their pockets with money. Well written by Rybar. Yes, many analysts compare what is happening with the rapid capture of Mosul in 2014 by ISIS *. And here I agree. Especially in the fact that such operations do not exclude the bribery of senior officials from the local security forces. When the average salary in the country can buy 2 kilograms of meat and corruption reigns. And soldiers are given a ration of 2 potatoes and an egg per day. In 2012, when all of Syria was shaken by terrorist attacks and clashes with militant groups, Aleppo almost fell for precisely this reason. And there was a war there for 4 long years. In any case, what is happening is an axiom of agreements. While some are relaxed, someone is always sharpening a knife to attack. And it hits at the right moment. So it is, so it was and so it will always be in the history of wars. S. Shilov * - terrorist organizations	https://t.me/rybar/65816	2024-11-29T06:37:09-08:00

🖼 🇬🇪🇪🇺 About night riots in Georgia Yesterday, Prime Ministe...	🇬🇪🇪🇺 About the night riots in Georgia Yesterday, Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said that the authorities are refusing negotiations on accession to the European Union until the end of 2028, as well as EU budget grants, as they intend to continue to fulfill their obligations for joining the union only at the expense of its own budget. According to Kobakhidze, by the end of 2028 Georgia will be economically point of view is duly ready to begin EU accession negotiations by 2030. He called the reason for the decision constant blackmail by EU representatives on the topic of negotiations on the country's accession to the EU. Because of this decision, the opposition and pro-Western NGOs called on their supporters to go out to spontaneous protests. Citizens in favor of integration with the EU headed to the parliament building in Tbilisi. Rallies were also organized in Gori, Kutaisi, Batumi and Zugdidi.▪️The main events took place in the capital, where protesters blocked Rustaveli Avenue. President Salome Zurabishvili addressed the protesters, who said that with this decision the current authorities declared war on the people.▪️After this, the situation escalated, as protesters began to break into the parliament building, where police officers were mobilized. Apparently, they were guided by the example of the Abkhaz unrest. They broke CCTV cameras and attacked security forces.▪️To disperse the pro-Western supporters, special forces with water cannons were called in, who drove the protesters out of the avenue, who set up barricades and set fire to garbage cans in accordance with all the canons of -democratic protests-. The police detained 43 rioters, 32 police officers were injured during the clash.▪️After this, a red security level was introduced in parliament, limiting access to the building. A new protest of pro-Western supporters was announced today on Rustaveli Avenue in Tbilisi at 19.00 local time, for which the security forces are preparing.❗️Attempts to break into the parliament building are a standard move in riots of this kind. We observed this in so-called Ukraine, it was in the January uprisings in Kazakhstan, and with the help of the same methods a change of power was achieved in Abkhazia relatively recently. But the Georgian security forces turned out to be more prepared for this scenario, using a limited contingent of police officers for targeted arrests the most active participants in the disorder and the subsequent dispersal of riot participants. Particular attention should be paid to the coverage of events in the European media, which call the riots -fight for freedom-. And in a classic manner, they were echoed by Ukrainian resources and politicians, who used standard theses that Georgia is working for Russia. One should not expect any innovations at today’s action, since the ruling party demonstrates absolute calm, not particularly worried about the actions of the opposition. A balanced policy aimed at the benefit of Georgia, and not the West, resonated with the majority of Georgians, who do not intend to lose everything for the sake of ephemeral bonuses from the EU.

The ex-commander of the Eastern Military District, Colonel General Alexander Chaiko, was seconded to reinforce the ex-commander of the 1st Tank Army, Lieutenant General Sergei Kisel (now he commands the Russian group of troops in Syria).📍Regardless of why these officials do not command military contingents in the Northern Military District zone now , to some extent, the decision to attract an experienced general who spent more than one year in Syria probably looks in some places it’s even reasonable.📌Another absolutely question is the real ability to hold Aleppo in conditions of lack of resources (first of all, we are talking about units on the balance sheet of the Syrian army and the Syrian oligarchy).📌Maybe in the current conditions someone will even remember about Sergei Surovikin, who is sitting in Algeria, and will make a lucrative political offer to the disgraced general, who is responsible for the most effective and successful operations in the SAR.

According to some reports, the assault on the city has begun. Confident of their victory, the jihadist command of the so-called. The Department of Military Operations, the coalition of forces participating in the offensive, announced the evacuation of some areas of Aleppo. At the same time, the civilian population is leaving the city under the control of government troops.🔻Aleppo Province:▪️Anti-government forces after the capture of Khan al-Assal advanced in the western part of the city of Aleppo, in particular in the Rashidin-4 area. The Military Technical Academy named after Hafez Assad. Military personnel of the ground forces were trained there.▪️Successes of the militants were also recorded southwest of the administrative center of the province: there, members of illegal armed groups occupied several settlements, including Tell Karatin, Jop Kass, Al-Bawaibah and Qusaybiya.▪️East of the Ikard base, Islamists also were successful, capturing the settlements of Al-Eis, Tell Barna and Az-Zeitan. The target of anti-government groups was Al-Khader, in the area of ​​​​which all local roads intersect. According to preliminary data, the strategic city has already fallen.❗Meanwhile, in the north of Aleppo province, Turkish-backed Syrian National Army groups are still preparing to attack the cities of Tell Rifaat and Menbij. The Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces are stationed there, but there is also a limited presence of the Syrian Armed Forces. If pro-Turkish forces occupy Tell Rifaat, this will actually open the way for them to Nubl and Az-Zahra - Shiite enclaves located north of Aleppo. From there they will be able to start moving towards the northern part of the city of Aleppo, making the task easier for their allies in the Syrian revolution. Idlib Province: The situation in the east of Idlib is less dire. There, terrorists - Hayat Tahrir al-Sham - and other factions (including those formed from foreign jihadists) set their sights on Saraqib, where the defense is held by soldiers of the 25th Special Forces Division (ex-Tiger Forces) Suheil al-Hassan.

Yesterday at the CSTO summit, Russian President Vladimir Putin separately focused on the topic of relations with Armenia. ▪️Representatives of Armenia did not come to Astana for the summit, but the day before they said in Yerevan that they did not object to the adoption of the planned documents. ▪️Putin noted that the difficult relations between Armenia and the CSTO are rather dictated by internal political processes in the republic itself. The President of the Russian Federation also responded to the claims of the Armenian authorities about the alleged inaction of the CSTO regarding the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh. The events in Karabakh have their own specifics, but are not related to the Organization, since Armenia itself never recognized the independence of the republic and did not include it in its membership. ▪️Putin believes that Armenia may in the future return to full-fledged work in the CSTO, since Yerevan did not announce its withdrawal from the Organization.🔻The main pro-government channel of Armenia predictably criticizes all theses, blaming Russia for all the troubles. The Armenian media unsuccessfully dispute the main argument that the complex relationship between Armenia and the CSTO is the result of the republic’s internal political problems. However, the rating of Nikol Pashinyan’s government is rapidly falling, and the main reason is the events in Karabakh and the problem of refugees. Yerevan did not recognize the independence of the republic until recently and denied the presence of the Armenian military there. Pashinyan does not recognize the Karabakh government in exile and is not ready to fight for the release of the military-political leadership of the republic from Azerbaijani prisons. And all because they will find authority in Armenian society and pose a threat to its power. To justify the internal crisis, it is easier to find an external reason, so the shadow falls on the Russian Federation and the CSTO. In addition, Pashinyan’s policy is greatly influenced by Americans and Europeans, for whom ousting the Russian Federation from Transcaucasia is their main goal. Anti-Russian rhetoric is the key to continued Western support for Pashinyan, including by pouring funds into his team. At the same time, Yerevan has so far softened the rhetoric regarding the CSTO, although back in September Pashinyan stated that the Organization allegedly threatens the security of the republic. After the American elections, the Armenian authorities took a wait-and-see attitude, not least of which is the warming of relations between the Russian Federation and Georgia. So far, Pashinyan is trying to sit on two chairs: trade turnover between the countries is reaching record numbers, but politically in Yerevan they are trying to distance themselves. #Armenia #CSTO #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇷🇺🇰🇿🇺🇦 Statements by Russian President Vladimir Putin at a press conference at the CSTO summit in Astana. 🔻Foreign policy: ▪️Russia and Kazakhstan can increase cooperation in nuclear energy. ▪️Russia and Kazakhstan need to do everything to strengthen...	https://t.me/rybar/65807	2024-11-29T04:32:59-08:00

This week, a business delegation from Japan arrived in Beijing, where they met with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng. During the negotiations, the Chinese politician expressed hope that Japanese business circles will further deepen cooperation with China. And the representative of Japan stated the need to overcome difficulties in bilateral relations. And although Japanese businessmen visit Beijing and other Chinese cities quite often, against the backdrop of statements by the leaders of the two countries about their intentions to develop stable ties, such meetings are worth watching closely. 🔻Relations between the two countries have become quite tense over the past few years. Important reasons for this development of events were Japan's participation in the American policy of limiting the export of semiconductor equipment to China and Chinese military activity in the region. However, now, according to statements, there is a need to restore relations. First of all, according to observers, this is due to the desire of the Chinese authorities to establish contacts with American allies on the eve of the new presidential term of Donald Trump. Perhaps Beijing believes that stable bilateral ties will encourage Japanese politicians not to participate in all the anti-Chinese projects of the new president. However, it is not yet known whether such a result will be achieved, given that the policy of the authorities in Tokyo most often follows the position of the Americans. #China #Japan @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usKyodo News+China shows support for Osaka Expo, vows safety for expats from JapanChinese Vice Premier He Lifeng showed support for the upcoming World Exposition in Osaka and pledged to ensure the safety of Japanese nationals in China as he met Wednesday with a business delegation from the neighboring country, the group says.	https://t.me/rybar/65806	2024-11-29T03:40:16-08:00

However, defense cooperation was also discussed - Prabowo and Starmer agreed to cooperate on expanding the capabilities of the Indonesian coast guard. Although this agreement was included in the section on sustainable economic development, the initiative clearly appeared in the context of the current situation in the South China Sea. Moreover, the parties plan to increase their partnership in the field of defense and security. 📌 Yes, the Indonesian president and Chinese leader Xi Jinping announced the start of resource development in the disputed waters, but this does not mean that the dispute between the countries has been resolved. Therefore, Indonesia actively accepts support from other states, even if the actions are aimed at containing China.

❗️🇷🇺🇸🇾 Crisis in Syria: a tale of unlearned lessons and walki...	❗️🇷🇺🇸🇾 Crisis in Syria: a tale of unlearned lessons and walking on rake The collapse of the front in Aleppo province was caused by many factors. Oleg Blokhin described the situation very accurately: this always happens when pride prevails over reason, and degradation is chosen instead of development. This applies directly to the Syrian army. After the ceasefire in the spring of 2020, there was a massive -relaxation-, exacerbating previous problems. The military leadership began to revere the laurels of past victories, as if the threat of war was gone forever. There was no talk of introducing drones or correcting past mistakes - why, if they already considered themselves winners? As a result, it turned out that there was no fortification and minefields again, and the density of troops was extremely low due to -dead souls- and fake reports.🔻Part of the problems are due to the severe economic crisis. Salaries are pitiful, motivation is low, and the fighters preferred to engage in trade, subsistence farming, or looting simply to survive. However, the reason for the crisis is not only the US sanctions, but also the ruling circles in Damascus: after the ceasefire, they decided that the previous methods, in many ways, had become the cause of the civil war were true. The cleansing of the corrupt state apparatus did not happen, and the mukhabarat began to fleece the impoverished population with redoubled force. But the local elites seemed to be convinced that someone else would solve their problems, perceiving a return to the Arab League as a guarantee of investment from the Gulf countries. The entire dialogue with the same Kurds and other parties was conducted from the position of the winner in an unfinished war.📌 It ended naturally. But who said that this story is only about Syria? Of course, the scale of the disaster is incomparable. But we still have problems with fraud and ignoring reports, including on the number of personnel. So far, no one is in a hurry to solve the total failure of communication and control of troops through Telegram, Discord and Starlink (but at least the responsible officials have been sent to jail for embezzlement cases). Alas, the division of the skin of the unkilled bear continues, as well as the blind faith that some areas will be obtained for free by some overseas order. And in this, the highly wise husbands and goal-setters are helped by an army of experts, who love to explain all problems with agreements of the oligarchs.❗️The inability to learn from mistakes, pride and arrogance leads to the fact that laughter at the fleeing Syrians is replaced by tears from the footage of the fall retreat of 22 near Kharkov , clumsy attempts to declare everyone in dispersal of fakes about the invasion of Kursk region, as well as stories that -worthless-, -barefoot- and -starving people- can’t do anything. I really want to believe that the current Syrian lesson - through unpleasant pain - will be learned. #Russia #Syria@rybarSupport usTelegramOleg Blokhin	https://t.me/rybar/65801	2024-11-29T00:56:22-08:00

The nuance is that they did this with the help of Ukrainian-made drones. The drones were brought from the so-called territory. Ukraine by motor transport: judging by the video, these were devices of the VACA BSh-20 type. One UAV can carry about 10 kg of hashish over a distance of 50 km, which exceeds the width of the Strait of Gibraltar. This is one of the consequences of the drone revolution, when even relatively large drones are becoming more and more accessible. Now criminals are actively starting to use them: it all started with the smuggling of packs of cigarettes, and now we are talking about organizing drug trafficking. At the same time, it is not at all surprising that Ukrainian-made drones appear in history: as practice shows, the Kiev regime does not disdain even the most dirty deeds, just to snatch crumbs from the table. Be it open cooperation with Al-Qaeda or a service to drug traffickers. And if you remember that from 2022 with the so-called. In Ukraine, a lot of criminal elements from pickpockets to telephone scammers entered the EU uncontrollably; it was a matter of time before Ukrainians entered the top in migrant crime in some countries. And Europe is waiting for a lot, a lot of similar news.#EU #Spain #Ukraine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/65800	2024-11-29T00:30:43-08:00
🇲🇷🇨🇿 About the deployment of Czech military personnel in Maur...	🇲🇷🇨🇿 About the deployment of Czech military personnel in Mauritania The North Atlantic Alliance, in addition to using Hungarians for its purposes in Chad, is involving more and more Eastern European armies in Africa. Here in the Czech parliament they decided to extend the mandate for foreign operations until 2026. In addition to the standard strengthening of the presence in the Balkans and the Baltic states due to the Russian threat, the point about the deployment of 30 special forces troops in Mauritania is interesting. The reason for the deployment of military personnel is the growing illegal migration through Mauritanian territory and the possible spread of terrorist groups. But there is also an increase in Russian and Chinese influence in the Sahel.▪️Of course, the Mauritanians are showing interest in investments from Russia and China and are participating in various African forums. At the same time, the agreements concluded several years ago with the North Atlantic Alliance make it one of the key points of Western military influence in the region. This is expressed both in participation in American exercises and in frequent visits of NATO military leaders to the country. In addition, in matters of weapons, the Mauritanian army relies on Western partners.🔻NATO’s motive for sending a contingent of Czechs to the country is most likely similar to the reasons for the appearance of Hungarian military personnel in Chad. This is something of a temporary solution in the interests of the West in the country while the larger players in Washington and Paris resolve bureaucratic issues before deploying their own troops.#Africa #Mauritania #Czech Republic@rybarSupport usmocr.mo.gov.czPoslanecká sněmovna schválila působení českých vojáků v zahraničních operacích do roku 2026Poslanecká sněmovna schválila působení českých vojáků v zahraničních operacích do roku 2026.

However, none of the drones ever reached the country. ▪️The Houthis were also active, attempting to launch a missile strike on the Nevatim airbase. The Palestine-2 hypersonic ballistic missile was successfully intercepted on approach to Israel. ▪️In turn, Israeli aircraft carried out several raids in the southwest of Homs province in Syria.

🖼 ❗️🇸🇾🏴 Militant offensive in western Aleppo: growing defense...	❗️🇸🇾🏴 Militant offensive in western Aleppo: growing crisis in the defense of government troopswhat is known by the end of November 28, 2024The situation in Aleppo province is rapidly deteriorating. Militants of Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS) and other factions occupied several settlements on the northern flank and began to storm the city of Anadan. 🔻The capture of this settlement will, in the event, cut off the route to the north, including to Nubol and Az-Zahra, from which pro-Iranian forces were evacuated today. During the day, militants attacked villages with rocket artillery.▪️To the west of Aleppo, fighting continues in the vicinity of Kafr Dael and Bashkatin. To the south, the situation is much worse - the militants have completed the cleansing of Jamiyat Kahraba and Khan Al-Assal. There they captured a large number of trophies, including artillery weapons, after which they advanced towards Aleppo itself.▪️The Nur ad-Din al-Zenki group attacked the Sahafiyoun area: judging by the footage overlooking the New Aleppo area, it managed to advance into boundaries of the settlement. In addition, battles for the Rashidin-4 area are reported, and the seizure of the Al-Asad Academy building is also confirmed. Militants of the unmanned unit represented by Kataib Shaheen attacked An-Neirab airport at least three times. This again proves that anti-government groups have their own strike UAVs, which were spotted last year.▪️In the Az-Zerba area, militants were not only able to gain a foothold in the vicinity of the highway, but also significantly expand the zone of control to the Ikarda base and move towards Al-Mugheir . In the latter, as in Khan Tuman, Syrian troops are still holding the line. The results of the battles for Az-Zeitan, where militants tried to advance to the Khalasa area, are still unknown. In parallel, government troops are retreating from the M5 highway, and the militants not only cut the road, but in some places captured settlements to the west of it. They also occupied Talhia and Arbikh, having significantly advanced towards the highway from the north of Serakib.▪️In Serakib itself and the surrounding area, the situation is better - there, units of the 25th Special Forces Division - Tiger Forces - under the leadership of Suheil Hasan, entered the battle from the march. In recent years, he has been in disgrace, but the crisis, apparently, has forced the ruling circles in Damascus to urgently forget about their differences.▪️Judging by the incoming news, fighting continues in Shabur and Dadiha; Serakib and Turunbu managed to defend themselves. To date, counterattacks have been reported in the area of ​​​​Kafr Battyk and Jubas - according to some reports, both settlements were even recaptured. Also, the leader of Jubas, Ansar al-Tawhid, named Abu al-Walid Saraqib, was eliminated. The general situation remains critical: government troops, at a minimum, may lose all territories west of the M5 highway, liberated at the beginning of 2020. However, given the offensive of the militants on a wide front, Aleppo itself may be under the threat of encirclement, the front to the west of which is also collapsing. Against this background, there are reports that groups of the Syrian National Army are gathering forces in Mari, Al-Bab and Azaz, from where they can attack in the direction of Tel Rifaat and open a second front in the province of Aleppo. They have already launched several kamikaze UAV launches on Tell Rifaat itself.

Last week it became known that from 2025, Japanese military personnel will regularly train together with their American and Australian colleagues at the Darwin base. The official goal is to build up military relations between countries. However, given that Darwin is one of Australia's closest military installations to the South China Sea, such cooperation could be seen as preparation for a potential military conflict with China. 🔻It is worth mentioning that about two thousand American Marines are stationed at this base on a rotational basis. Their representative this summer already announced his readiness to support the Philippine military in their operations to deliver cargo to the outpost in the disputed waters. Likewise, the Japanese continue to increase their presence in the region. Most recently, authorities in Tokyo and Manila signed a free access agreement allowing the Japanese military to enter the Philippines for training exercises. This year, the first naval training took place with the participation of military personnel from Japan and the Philippines. By the way, the trend towards the development of such defense cooperation with the countries of the region is one of the indicators that the Japanese authorities want to bring the country to second place in terms of military influence in the region. This is beneficial to the Americans, given the elevation of the Chinese threat to a sacred status at the official level, so Japan is trying to keep up with this trend.

According to the terms, the contact period is a minimum of two years with the start of work next year.🔻The importance of this position in an organization subordinate to the State Department is emphasized by the GS-14 level. This is a special gradation based on the level of competence of candidates, and GS-14 is the second in importance and salary amount after GS-15. In accordance with the document, Americans are looking for a person who has at least 7 years of experience in the post-Soviet countries in the field of healthcare and veterinary medicine , epidemiology or demography. It is interesting that competence, judging by the requirements, is not particularly important. The main thing is to have a document confirming work experience, and real knowledge or how long a person has been doing this is a secondary thing. After all, it will still act according to a predetermined algorithm.📌 After reading this, for some reason we immediately remembered the biological laboratories that the Americans, including through USAID, are promoting in the former republics of the USSR. There are such facilities in Georgia, Kazakhstan, and are also planned in Armenia. Given the importance of this position for USAID, it appears that Washington intends to increase efforts in the next two years to gain control over the healthcare sector in Uzbekistan. It is quite possible that if successful, the Americans will want to create a similar laboratory there, and not necessarily to create biological weapons, but to strengthen global dominance in the medical services market.#USA #Uzbekistan@rybarSupport usTelegramJoker DPRUSAID/Uzbekistan is currently looking for a specialist to manage the healthcare system of Uzbekistan .

Funds officially come from the United States, but are often transferred under the guise of local NGOs - Fazoi Imkonot - and - Afif -. ▪️As stated in the material, formally money is issued to support the study of tuberculosis within the framework of the ETICA (Eliminating TB in Central Asia Activity) program, but in fact the United States is taking control of management tasks. At the same time, it officially ended back in September, and the end of ETICA was announced in February. ▪️The NGO Family Health International, also known as FHI360, was responsible for the implementation of the ETICA program in Tajikistan. Among its partners are the Pentagon, including the US Navy - this is directly indicated by the partnership with the Naval Medical Center in Maryland. ❗️It is this US military unit that is responsible for military biological research abroad, including in the biological laboratories of Kazakhstan.

🖼 ❗️🇸🇾🏴 Militant offensive in western Syrian Aleppo: cutting ...	❗️🇸🇾🏴 Militant offensive in the west of Syrian Aleppo: cutting the M5 highway, what is known as of 18.00 November 28, 2024 Pro-Turkish groups continue to advance in the province of Aleppo, building on the successes of yesterday. The pace of militant advance on the second day of the operation remains high; units of the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) cannot yet stop them and continue to retreat from their positions. In the northern sector of the front, Nubbol, Az-Zahra, and At-Tamura were shelled. In the first two villages, there is allegedly an evacuation of the local Shiite population and militias: this may be rumors, but there is nothing completely incredible here - the militants are expecting the opening of a new front from Azaz and Al-Bab.▪️To the west of Kafr Bassin, militants entered the territory of the settlement of Yaqid Al-Adas, where they captured an infantry fighting vehicle and a tank of government troops. At the same time, yesterday’s information about a breakthrough to the outskirts of Anadan has not yet been confirmed.▪️In Babis, militants are striking with drones, and to the southwest clashes continue for Bashanta. Apparently, they did not visit the neighboring Jamiyat al-Hadi and Jamiyat Thalass about the Turkish groups. Later, information appeared about the militants consolidating in Bashant and beginning to advance towards Bishkatin. Fighting continues in the Kafr Naha area, and the anti-government media announced the capture of Khan al-Asal. At the same time, Syrian sources claim that the nearby M5 highway is not blocked - this suggests that in reality the clashes are taking place on the southwestern outskirts of the city. ▪️According to our data, Syrian troops had previously left the city; there is no information about attempts to counterattack. At the same time, nearby militants captured the territory of the police college, which was used as a base for SAA artillerymen. ▪️In the vicinity of Ar-Radwan and Kafr Juma, militants occupied the territory of the settlements Al-Sheikh Ali and Rif Muhaisidin al-Awal, capturing 8 tanks and two infantry fighting vehicles of the Syrian army. News also appeared about militants entering Az-Zerba. A little later, the militants expanded the wedge on both sides along the highway, moving towards the Ikarda military base and the Kamari forest to the south and to the Alam al-Sikhr complex to the north. 🔻For many, the situation in Serakib is better for the SAA. Despite the strikes and attacks by militants in the direction of the western outskirts, the city has not yet been lost. In addition, there are no reports of militants occupying Turumba and the junction to the north-west of Serakib, where a fairly large fortified area is located.▪️To the south-west there are battles for Jubas and, according to some reports, Shabur, the control of which is disputed by both sides. In the area of ​​Dadiha and Kafr Battyk, the Syrians also managed to repel the militants and prevent them from cutting the M5 highway. ▪️Most of Dadikh itself was lost, however, fighting is taking place on the eastern and south-eastern outskirts of the village.

Over the past days, they have liberated several settlements and improved the tactical situation in certain sectors of the front. ▪️On the northern flank of the Russian Armed Forces they are repelling counterattacks in the Lozovatsky area. The front here for a long time partially runs along the Kazenny Torets River, to the north of which the Ukrainian Armed Forces organized defense at the Elizavetovka-Vozdvizhenka line. Russian units have not yet made any attempts to cross the water barrier. ▪️In the central sector of the direction of the Russian Armed Forces, battles are ongoing north of Nikolaevka in order to squeeze the enemy out of the stronghold on the approaches to the village. At the moment, neither side has stable control over it and the neighboring forest belts, and the enemy is launching counterattacks using armored vehicles. To the west, the Russian Armed Forces managed to make significant progress in Lysovka, reaching the southern shore of the reservoir in the Solenenkaya gully. After the liberation of Novogrodovka, this settlement became one of the key defense centers of Ukrainian formations south of Myrnograd. It is not known whether Russian attack aircraft entered the northern part of the village with more dense buildings. Advancement in the south, in turn, will allow the Russian Armed Forces to reach the eastern outskirts of Dachensky, which creates a threat of encirclement for the Ukrainian Armed Forces forces in the pocket between Lysovka and Petrovka. ▪️On the southern flank of the direction, Russian troops liberated Petrovka, knocking out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from its northwestern part. The enemy held the defense based on the Solenaya River, but the attack aircraft were able to knock him out of the village during a flank attack.❗️Later, Russian units were spotted in the Zheltoy area, more than three kilometers to the northwest. At the moment, it is not known for certain whether they advanced towards the village along the forest belts from Petrovka or advanced from Pustynka. To the south, Russian troops are advancing towards Pustynka from Grigorovka and Yuryevka. Battles were also noted to the west of Novoalekseevka - at the moment, the Russian Armed Forces have finally knocked out the enemy from the territory of the gardens and surrounding forest belts. After liberating Pustynka and consolidating the achieved lines in the Yuryevka area, Russian troops will have the opportunity to launch an offensive towards Pushkino and the T-05-15 highway. 🔻Later, Russian units were spotted already in the central part of Zheltoy, more than three kilometers northwest of Petrovka. At the moment, it is not known for certain whether Russian troops advanced to the village along the forest belts from Petrovka or were advancing from Pustynka, however, battles are already taking place in the center of the village.

Ankara may well seize the moment and launch an operation against the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in northern Syria.▪️The first likely direction of attack appears to be Tell Rifyat and the surrounding area north of the city of Aleppo. Since 2018, militants, with the support of Turkish artillery, have repeatedly tried to advance in the area, but the Kurds, together with the SAA, have repelled all attacks over and over again.▪️The second is the isthmus between the areas captured by the Turks during the operations -Euphrates Shield- and -Source of Peace-. If successful, the militants will be able to connect territories, which fits into Turkey’s plans to create a buffer zone in northern Syria.▪️Finally, another goal could be Manbij, which Erdogan threatened to capture back in 2016 and periodically demanded the SDF to leave the city, making -the latest Chinese warnings- and promising to take action in case of refusal. Previously, Turkey did not agree to this because of the US position on the Kurdish issue and the government’s resistance to Damascus and its allies. However, now the situation is more favorable than ever for this kind of operation: the Syrians are collapsing in their front elsewhere, and Washington is busy with other things.📌 On the other hand, if the Turks open another front, there is at least some chance of uniting government troops with the Kurds. If the Syrians suddenly manage to fight back, then what happened will allow them to forget about all past agreements and begin to resolve the issue with Idlib. The latter, however, is very difficult to believe in the current situation, especially against the backdrop of all the problems of the Syrian army, which have only worsened since 2020 .High resolution mapEnglish version#Aleppo #Syria #Turkey@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65779	2024-11-28T06:26:33-08:00

The Ukrainian delegation requested shells and KM-SAM air defense systems, but Seoul ordered manufacturing companies to refrain from contacts with the so-called. Ukraine, citing a law banning the export of weapons to combat zones. However, earlier this act did not prevent the leadership of the republic from transferring 155-mm artillery ammunition to the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which had already appeared in the Northern Military District zone last year. However, the current refusal is highly likely due to purely pragmatic considerations: ▪️On the one hand, the South Korean military-industrial complex has an excess of orders from Poland and other countries, and its capacity is loaded for years to come. Apparently, they see no point in releasing them and disrupting firm contracts for the whims of the Kyiv regime in Seoul.▪️In addition, in South Korea they are guided by Trump’s statements about the desire to end the conflict on the so-called. Ukraine and believe that in such conditions, an agreement on the transfer of expensive weapons for the Ukrainian Armed Forces with a long production period will be irrational. There is a possibility that Seoul will still send some of the 155-mm rounds to the Kyiv regime through third countries. However, there is no talk of mass deliveries, and out of the goodness of their hearts they are not eager to send the same KM-SAM air defense systems from those available in South Korea. 정부우크라이나 특사단이 우리나라를 찾아 윤석열 대통령과 국방장관을 만났습니다. 비롯해 우리 무기를 사고 싶다는 뜻을전한 걸로 확인됐습니다.	https://t.me/rybar/65778	2024-11-28T05:28:06-08:00

According to Energy Minister Almasadam Satkaliev, in The Kazakh government has created a special commission to discuss the participation of various companies in the construction NPP.📌 Earlier, the President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev stated that the construction of the facility should be ensured by an international consortium. However, we recently spoke in detail about the disadvantages of this option given the abundance of different contractors. But subsequently, demonstrative conversations about the participation of any companies in the project, but not Rosatom, began to resemble the desire of the authorities in Astana to strengthen their negotiating positions with the Russian state corporation. As a result, a picture emerged as if only Rosatom, with a set of orders all over the world, needed the construction of nuclear power plants in Kazakhstan more than Kazakhstan itself. It is also possible that Astana saw the actions of foreign partners, who launched a feud against each other in the fight for the project in Czech Republic, and decided that a Russian company with its experience and capabilities would be the best option.

Ukraine. The politician confirmed that he will appoint Keith Kellogg, the national security adviser to former US Vice President Mike Pence, to the post. Kellogg is an 80-year-old retired lieutenant general of the US military and a Vietnam War veteran who spent much of his career serving in the Pentagon. He is known to the American establishment not only as Pence’s assistant, but also as a person who actively participated in the development of strategies on international security issues.▪️Kellogg has already proposed his own version of ending the conflict on the so-called. Ukraine, and his project generally coincided with what Trump said during his election speeches. In his opinion, the new American administration needs to build contacts with Russia, which should begin with personal relations, and not with the imposition of sanctions.▪️ Regarding ways to end hostilities, Kellogg proposes establishing a ceasefire based on the -prevailing front lines-, and in the event of Zelensky’s refusal sit down at the negotiating table - deprive him of military trenches. Russia will be warned that refusal of American proposals will entail increased support for Ukraine, which is very likely, given Trump’s tendency to negotiate from a position of strength and through pressure.▪️Kellogg has also already spoken out about the future fate of NATO and the role of the United States in it: He said that Trump's return to the White House could lead to the fact that some members of the Alliance, whose defense spending does not reach the required 2% of GDP, will lose the right to American protection in the event of attacks from outside. We can confidently conclude that Keith Kellogg is another like-minded Trump and his loyal ally, ready to implement the plans of the newly elected US President. It is unclear who exactly was the ideologist of Trump's peace plan, but given Kellogg's experience, it can be assumed that it was he who advised the politician on this issue.

Forwarded From Global Studies🇷🇺🇸🇾🏴 About the militant attack on Aleppo, causes and consequences The militant offensive that began yesterday was expected by many. There was a lot of information about terrorists preparing for an attack, they were practicing tactics, strengthening positions, replenishing supplies, but for some reason this came as a surprise to our command and the leadership of the SAR. There could be many reasons, starting from the rigidity of thinking of the command staff controlling the troops in Syria (those people who got rid of in the Northern Military District suddenly found themselves in -honorable exile- in the Syrian Arab Republic), and ending with a belief in -established for a long time world - Many colleagues are reviewing this topic now, trying to point out errors. Let's hope that this will at least somehow help stabilize the situation, because the militants of the pro-Turkish groups act in a coordinated manner, moving from village to village with the ultimate goal of cutting off supplies to Aleppo. It seems that they themselves did not expect that they would be able to break through to the most outskirts of the administrative center and cut off the M5 highway. But for the Syrian military, all this turned out to be an even greater surprise, which was noticeable by the speed of their movement from their positions.❓Why didn’t the decision-makers notice anything? Big question. Even the events of recent days surrounding relations between Turkey and the United States should have attracted attention, since the Americans stopped opposing the use of Russian S-400s by the Turks. You understand how serious everything was. And the Turkish Minister of Defense then said that Türkiye would return to the F-35 program, from which the Americans threw out their colleagues for purchasing Russian air defense systems! That is, an agreement was reached, and based on the events of these two days, the subject of bargaining is visible. Pro-Turkish militants have always been a bargaining chip, and they were required to strike in such a way as to show the weakness of the positions of the Syrian leadership and our contingent there. If the situation is not brought under control in the coming days, then the West will achieve this goal with the help of terrorists. Taking into account the already wavering positions of our army in the Syrian Arab Republic after the IDF strikes on the province of Latakia, due to which claims from the Syrian side began to pour in due to inaction, this push towards Aleppo turned out to be very convenient in timing for Russia’s opponents in the region. And his clear coordination is proof of this. Now, in fact, all that remains is for the Turks to launch an operation against the Kurds. And the existing island of Syrian Democratic Forces near Aleppo has been very worrying for the Turks over the past years, and they would like to get rid of it by taking control of it. And, looking at the agreement with the United States, this is quite possible. #Russia #Syria #TerrorismGlobalistics - subscribe to the Telegram channelRybar🇷🇺🇸🇾🏴 Alexander Kharchenko, who is now in Syria, is rushing around the provinces of Hama and Aleppo, trying to piece together a picture of what is happening.

According to the department, the State Department doubts the final establishment of Yerevan’s pro-Western course. That is why in Washington they are betting on the promotion of pro-Western parties on the eve of the parliamentary elections of 2026. These include -Republic - Aram Sargsyan, -In the Name of the Republic - Arman Babajanyan, -European Party of Armenia - Tigran Khzmalyan, -Christian Democratic Party - Levon Shirinyan . In the United States, they want to ensure the passage of parties into parliament to support the pro-Western path and control the executive branch in order to prevent a repetition of the Georgian scenario. Note that agents of American influence are also actively placed in the government and especially in the security bloc. There is also the prospect of holding early parliamentary elections as early as 2025, if Armenia concludes a peace treaty with Azerbaijan in the near future. 🔻For now, the Armenian authorities are sticking to their previous course, trying to please Western curators on publicly distancing themselves from Russia. For example, in Yerevan they are trying to ignore meetings within the CSTO and indirectly take part in meetings within the CIS, but at the same time maintain lively contacts within the EAEU. The Americans do not hide their intentions to completely break off Armenian-Russian relations. However, the attitude of the new US administration towards the South Caucasus will also play a big role. #Armenia #Russia #USA @rybarSupport ussvr.gov.ruForeign Intelligence Service of the Russian FederationOfficial server of the Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation on the Internet.	https://t.me/rybar/65770	2024-11-28T01:31:06-08:00
🇺🇦 In recent days, the thesis that the failure...	🇺🇦 In recent days, the Ukrainian media field has been promoting the thesis that the failures of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Donbass are a consequence of the supposedly huge numerical superiority of the Russian Armed Forces. The speakers talk about the ratio of forces of 1:7 and the need to call up 2 million people to correct the situation. In fact, with all the problems of the Ukrainian formations, there is no total shortage of manpower. There is also enough for fresh formations, which is actively facilitated by mass raids of the TCC in the territory controlled by the Kyiv regime. A similar situation arises with the equipment that the United States and other NATO countries continue to regularly supply to the so-called. Ukraine. For the same reason, recently the brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with numbers from 155 to 159 again received the status of mechanized, although previously they were infantry due to a lack of vehicles.📌 Therefore, the recent statements of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Syrsky about the preparation of a new counter-offensive are not far from the truth. The enemy is accumulating forces for a new strike, which will most likely be timed to coincide with Trump taking office. The goal is to create the desired effect and try to justify the continuation of Western support. And all the stories of Ukrainian speakers about the supposedly huge numerical superiority of the Russian Armed Forces are aimed at at least somehow explaining the retreat in Donbass to the domestic audience. Especially against the backdrop of past propaganda theses of the Kyiv regime, which denied the possibility of such successes in the Russian Armed Forces.#mediatechnology #Ukraine@rybarSupport usRossiyskaya GazetaThe Armed Forces of Ukraine have calculated how many people Kyiv needs to mobilize for a counter-offensive - Rossiyskaya GazetaKiev needs to mobilize at least 1.8 million people in order to have the very opportunity for a counteroffensive.

In general, from the events of one day we can conclude that the militants were preparing for a new round of war, while the Syrian army and the group of Russian troops (forces) in the Syrian Arab Republic were in the happy paradigm of eternal peace. Alexander Kartavykh in impartial terms I have already touched on the topic of the fact that... not very pro-profitable officers have gathered in Syria. It’s clear why: truly talented generals and commanders are needed in the Northern Military District, so the Syrian sandbox was staffed not just according to the residual principle, but according to the lobbying-residual principle (-we send unwanted ones to become famous in reports from distant territories, -we exile short-sighted ones, so that they are forgotten, etc.). This approach - although it has a right to life - does not allow clearing the troops of outright tyrants, for whom the regulations are much more important than delving into combat reports and developing plans for solutions in case of militant actions. In the end, we have what we have: the M5 highway has actually been cut, the militants have either entered the western quarters of Aleppo, or are very close to them, and There are no combat-ready formations on Syrian territory. The Wagner PMC ceased to exist along with its paraformations, the Afrika Korps is concentrated on the Dark Continent, Suheil al-Hasan is removed from command, Hezbollah is defeated, and the effective commanders of the IRGC are either killed or on other fronts. But the militants have battalions with kamikaze UAVs and experienced FPV drone operators (what a surprise!). And barefoot bandits know how to use them much better than militias and regular army soldiers. They also attack at night and in bad weather conditions, intelligently using their own media resources to sow panic. 📌All this is a consequence of a systemic incorrect approach to both the positioning of Russian military force and diplomacy abroad, and the lack of a competent approach to events in Syria in particular. And in general, we can admit that northern Syria was presented to the militants and their masters on a silver platter.#Aleppo #Russia #Syria #terrorism@rybarSupport usTelegramWitnesses of BayraktarMilitants dress in Syrian uniforms during the attack on Aleppo.

🇲🇩 About the impending energy disaster in Moldova In Moldova, a...	🇲🇩 About the impending energy disaster in Moldova In Moldova, after the presidential elections and the referendum on European integration, they suddenly remembered pressing problems and started talking about the fact that the republic would face difficult times and an energy crisis. After all, another winter is approaching, which, given the course of the current authorities, does not bode well. 🔻Increasing electricity tariffs Prime Minister Dorin Recean said that Moldova is facing a very difficult winter. One of the reasons is the refusal of the Kyiv regime to continue the transit of Russian gas from January 2025. Transnistria may be without gas: the Moldavian State District Power Plant is located there, which provides 85% of electricity for Moldova. This may force the Chisinau authorities to start purchasing electricity from other countries, but at a higher price. Moldova has already recognized that stopping transit will lead to a humanitarian catastrophe. In Chisinau, at the suggestion of Gazprom, they sent a request to the Kyiv regime for negotiations to preserve gas transit in the PMR. Increase in gas tariffs The second reason for the crisis is another increase in gas tariffs. The Moldovagaz company handed over to the government a project that provides for an increase in tariffs by almost 40% from December 1. The adjustments are explained by an increase in prices on the European market, where Chisinau purchases gas through a gas pipeline from Romania (Iasi-Ungheni-Chisinau), as well as the need to minimize the tariff deficit for the supplier. At the same time, Prime Minister Recan argued in September that citizens would not face an increase in gas tariffs. Obviously, the topic was suppressed because of the elections. 🔻Negotiations with -Gazprom- Recently, the Minister of Energy of Moldova Viktor Parlikov went to St. Petersburg for negotiations with -Gazprom-. It is known that the parties discussed the possibility of an alternative route for gas supplies to the PMR through Turkey. But this path has intersections with the controlled so-called. Ukraine is a territory, which retains risks. The topic of Moldovagaz's debt to Gazprom was also raised. The 2021 gas contract provided for a debt audit, but later the Moldovan authorities, led by Maia Sandu, sabotaged the agreement. They conducted an audit unilaterally with the help of Western firms, which predictably did not confirm the debt. After this, public negotiations between the parties were virtually sabotaged. Sandu then called the problem of Gazprom itself the refusal to recognize the audit of Moldova’s debt. In Chisinau they claimed that they no longer depend on Russian gas and purchase fuel on the European market. True, this was a repurchase of Russian gas at an inflated price, but political slogans were much more important then. ❗️ It is obvious that Moldova will soon face another energy crisis due to Chisinau’s refusal to conduct a constructive dialogue with Russia in recent years. At the same time, it will be interesting to watch possible negotiations between Chisinau and the Kyiv regime on gas transit. After all, in recent years, Ukrainian grain and Western weapons have been driven through Moldova, to its own detriment. And the big question is how they will repay for such a service on the so-called. Ukraine.#Moldova #Transnistria #Russia #Ukraine @rybarSupport usNewsMaker-A very hard winter awaits us-.

Forwarded From Global Studies🇦🇲🇬🇷🇮🇳 About Indian weapons and the nuances of their operation While all attention is focused on Syria, which we will also discuss later, I would like to note a couple of points on military-technical cooperation between Armenia and other countries. It is not yet possible to confirm the S-300 from Greece, but interesting nuances have surfaced regarding India.📌 Despite the current attempts by the Armenian authorities to hide cooperation with India, information has surfaced online. Moreover, transport workers regularly make flights from India, bringing something to the Armenians. For example, the Pinaka MLRS have been in Armenia for a long time at the base in Gyumri, and they are idle. This is due to one important point: local operating conditions are not suitable for either the Pinaka or the ATAGS barrel guns. The equipment itself is crude, and the Indian authorities did not bother to provide the Armenians with their own specialists to service the artillery. The following situation arises: the Armenian specialists do not particularly understand it, the Indians do not help, since they are not ready for this, simply selling it to the Armenians. As a result, the Armenians test the equipment they receive and put it in the garage because it breaks down quickly and the wait for spare parts is long. And in order not to break it, it is idle. And in the price-efficiency ratio, they are literally golden in cost. Add to this the shortage of 155-mm ammunition, which is now hard to find all over the world, and it turns out that the Armenians bought weapons from India simply for intimidation. But they are not going to stop there. They also intend to purchase light transport aircraft from India. The Armenians now have only 3 Il-76s, of which only one flies. There are no spare parts, and nowhere to get them, since the Armenian authorities have cut off contacts with Russia. #Armenia #Greece #IndiaGlobalistics - subscribe to the Telegram channelRybar🇦🇲🇬🇷 On the possible transfer of Russian air defense systems from Greece to Armenia The Greek publication Enikos claims that Athens intends to transfer Russian anti-aircraft missile systems S-300, TOR-M1 and Osa-AKM.

Forwarded From Colonel Trifonov In a store in Nizhny Novgorod, part of the humanitarian cargo collected by schoolchildren of the Rostov region for military personnel of the Russian Armed Forces performing combat missions in the area of ​​military operations was identified. The humanitarian aid was discovered by a resident of the Bor district. He purchased two camouflage nets from a commercial store, inside of which were parcels and letters written by schoolchildren from Novoshakhtinsk, Rostov Region, to fighters in the Northern Military District zone. As the store owner stated, he purchases similar goods through Avito, which means that identifying the sender will not be difficult .I believe that Rostov law enforcement officers need to get involved in checking this information, identify a traitor in the volunteer movements of the region and involve him in the most public way possible. criminal liability.

This actually opens up a direct path to Aleppo for Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and other factions.❗️In addition, Turkish media claim that Syrian armed forces, simultaneously with the capture of Khan al-Asal, occupied a small section of the M5 international highway in the area, actually disrupting logistics between Aleppo and Damascus.▪️Slightly to the north, Islamists attacked a village Tower. With the establishment of control over it, the allied Hayat Tahrir al-Sham groups will be able to reach Kafr Dail, Mansoura, and from there launch an attack on the same Aleppo.▪️By the evening, reports appeared about the start of fighting in the Saraqib area, located in the east of the province Idlib. From its territory, the Syrian Arab Army constantly attacked HTS targets; the M5 highway also runs nearby. Its capture will significantly undermine the combat capabilities of the Syrian Armed Forces. Meanwhile, columns of the pro-Turkish Syrian National Army (SNA) continue to enter from the north of the province to the fronts of its western part, more and more units of which are declaring their support for the operation of the Idlib brothers.📌 Against this background on the Internet they started talking again about the preparation of the Turkish Armed Forces for a similar operation, but against the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in Tell Rifaat and Menbije. Most likely, Turkish troops will take advantage of the turmoil in Idlib to resolve their issues with the Kurds. Increasing attacks and shelling by Kurdish militias are cited as a reason. Thus, recently the SDF attacked the positions of militants - Ahrar al-Sharqiya - near the city of Al-Bab, which led to the death of 17 members of pro-Turkish gangs. As for the government troops, they have not yet put up fierce resistance, although in some areas they have been able to delay the advance militants. Now the Syrian media are writing about the transfer of reinforcements from the Syrian Armed Forces to the west of Aleppo. However, given the effectiveness of today’s moderate attacks, it is possible that in the near future they will go directly to the western quarters of the city of Aleppo. And at the moment, the main question is where the Syrian troops will be able to repel those who believed too much in themselves - the warriors of Sham -?

Ukraine, including the Ukrainian Armed Forces missile complex in the south of the Odessa region. Ukrainian formations, in turn, carried out a massive UAV raid on the Republic of Crimea. In the Pokrovsky direction, Russian units established control over most of Lysovka, reaching the southern shore of the reservoir in the Solenenkaya gully, and also completely liberated Petrovka. In the Kurakhovsky direction, the RF Armed Forces, according to objective control personnel, completely liberated Berestki. To the south there are battles in Kurakhovo and at the Romanovka-Konstantinopolskoe line. In the Vremevsky direction, Russian attack aircraft have approached the eastern outskirts of Bolshaya Novoselovka and are actively using unmanned platforms to destroy enemy fortifications. To the west there are battles at the Rovnopol-Novodarovka line. A major power grid failure occurred in the Zaporozhye and Kherson directions, affecting the population of both regions. In parallel with this, shelling of civilian infrastructure by the enemy does not stop.

In the north of the enclave, IDF units also carried out an operation in the Al-Sheikh Radwan area: they surrounded the Auni al-Hartani school and arrested the men there. All detainees were taken to an unknown direction. In the West Bank, traditional raids by Israeli security forces took place in several settlements. One of the operations was in Idna, where the house of a local militant accused of killing three IDF soldiers was destroyed. In southern Lebanon, a ceasefire came into force this morning, leading to a massive return of evacuated Lebanese to their homes.

This photo appeared on the Turkish segment of the Internet, and it is signed as the transfer of a convoy of military equipment of the Turkish Armed Forces to the Salamah checkpoint on the border with Syria. The publication Aawsat confirms this information, saying that the Turks sent reinforcements as part of Operation Euphrates Shield to begin with attacks on -Syrian Democratic Forces-. Now the convoy is moving towards the city of Maryamin in the north of Aleppo. Yesterday, a column of Turkish armored vehicles in the amount of about 50 vehicles, including artillery and tanks, passed through the Kafr-Lusin border crossing. The strengthening of the Turkish group is associated with an incursion of Kurds from the SDF into positions pro-Turkish Syrian National Army on Monday, after which the Turks increased the number of attacks on the Kurds.

The drones were intercepted over the sea, where the debris fell.▪️Then, for almost two hours, the 31st Air Force and Air Defense Division shot down raids by UAV groups near Saki and Sevastopol. Air defense crews destroyed 19 drones on approach, three more were suppressed by electronic warfare.▪️At the time the air defense was operating against the UAV, Ukrainian formations alternately launched two anti-ship missiles -Neptune-, which were also successfully intercepted over the sea off the northern side of Sevastopol.▪️It is noteworthy that 26- The drone was located at a distance from what was happening. And after the units of the 31st division finished their work, the UAV turned around and flew away. Apparently, he was supposed to record arrivals, but nothing happened.❗️The day before, four reconnaissance aircraft were operating in the Black Sea region, two of which were long-range radar detection. Taking into account their specifications, they ensured the identification of targets before the raid. Well, we must not forget that after such massive UAV raids, an equally massive missile strike occurs. Two Neptune anti-ship missiles are more like testing our air defense, and then larger attacks should be expected.

The information disseminated on the Internet about the capture of certain three Russian officers has not been confirmed at this stage.▪️During almost 10 hours of the offensive, the militants managed to get closer in different areas to a distance of 8-9 km from the western outskirts of Aleppo. The offensive at this stage is in the best traditions of the raid of Ukrainian formations in the Kharkov region in 2022: maximum advance along the main road directions without consolidation in populated areas in an attempt to capture as much booty as possible and mark new borders.▪️Among the advancing groups there are no only terrorists from -Hayat Tahrir al-Sham-: confirmed participation of Uighur militants from -Islamic Party of Turkestan-, which traditionally operated much further west (in the north of Latakia), Uzbek militants, the bulk of whom operated on the border with the province of Hama, as well as parts of other groups. All this speaks of the planned transfer of a significant number of combat-ready units, which are also involved in a -psychological- attack on the Syrians: foreign fighters have always been perceived as the most dangerous by quite timid Syrians.▪️Apparently, in some areas the Syrian army with allies managed to stop the advance of the militants: footage of destroyed enemy armored vehicles is published on the Internet. The terrorists have not been able to develop an advance north from Al-Sheikh Aqil and have not yet been able to break through the defenses near Kafr Nakha and east of Anjara.📌In the information space of Syria, as before during any exacerbations, there is almost complete denial of the loss of settlements and calls - not to believe enemy propaganda -. Such lulling words have long ceased to work: information resources of militants are taken on a massive scale, with the active involvement of bloggers and propagandists who try to write stand-ups and record short videos from literally every piece of the area, savoring success in every possible way.🔻The transfer of fire brigades to the site - the same 25 divisions (former Tiger Forces) of Suheil al-Hassan - not yet visible, therefore, more likely In all, the militants will be able to further expand the breakthrough area, taking advantage of the total unpreparedness of the Syrian Arab Army for defense. Air strikes by both the Syrian Air Force and the Russian Aerospace Forces are now clearly on an insufficient scale to stop the militants’ breakthrough to the west of Aleppo.

At the same time, Israel managed to violate the truce several times: several artillery shells fell in the area of ​​​​Marun ar-Ras, Khiam and Kafr Kila. However, this has not yet led to an aggravation, and the Israel Defense Forces stated that the target was suspected persons who entered areas closed by the Israelis.🔻Despite statements by IDF spokesman Avichai Adrai that Israeli units still remain in the territories of the South Lebanon, citizens of the Arab Republic publish footage of local residents returning to occupied cities. It is worth noting that a few hours before the deadline After the signing of the truce, Israeli troops launched concentrated attacks on several Lebanese cities, including the southern part of Beirut, where one of the leaders of Hezbollah's aviation unit was killed. The fighters of the Lebanese group responded with rocket salvoes at settlements in northern Israel.▪️As ​​for the mood of the civilian population on both sides of the barricades, an interesting picture emerges here. The Lebanese, despite all the devastation, perceive the signing of peace as actually a defeat for Israel, which failed to achieve Hezbollah’s withdrawal across the Litani River and the creation of a buffer zone.▪️Israeli citizens were divided on this issue: looking at the return of Lebanese refugees to their homes, as well as flags of the Shiite group flashing in the frames, some wonder - why did you start? Such sentiments are also fueled by far-right politicians like Itamar Ben-Gvir. The Palestinians’ reaction to what happened is interesting: according to Western media, the Hamas movement welcomed the ceasefire and thanked Hezbollah for its support. The group also expressed its readiness to sign a similar agreement in the Gaza Strip.🔻As we wrote earlier, no matter the outcome, the Lebanese-Israeli front remains a rather hot spot. Even if the parties have agreed on the need for de-escalation, this does not mean that an armed conflict will not start again in the near future: many reasons for this can be found. The Lebanese will not sit still and will take advantage of the respite to restore their combat capabilities. Well, the ultra-Orthodox Israeli authorities, not without reason, will see this as a threat and will accuse Hezbollah of preparing to resume attacks on Israeli territory. In the meantime, while the truce is in effect, the Israeli government will focus its attention on other areas that pose no less a threat to the Jewish people. This is both the same Palestinian West Bank, where Hamas cells operate, and long-suffering Syria.

Previously, there was talk of the possible transfer by Greece of the so-called S-300 air defense systems. Ukraine. In exchange, the Greeks plan to spend $2 billion on the purchase of Israeli air defense systems until 2026. ▪️The media note that the deal is being promoted by the French, who are trying to gain a foothold as the main arms supplier to Armenia. The Greeks will not transfer the systems for free, especially since Armenia approved an increase in the defense budget by 20% in 2025. ❗️One of the main reasons for the transfer of Russian air defense systems is the presence of Armenians with experience in their operation, as well as access to the necessary spare parts for their maintenance. Perhaps, the announcement of this reason looks very comical, given the rhetoric of the Armenian authorities and the media under their control that they no longer need Russian weapons, and any non-Russian ones are better. But suddenly it turned out that it was most convenient for Armenians to use Russian weapons. Let's see what amazing arguments the pro-Pashinyan media will now come up with. #Armenia #Greece #Russia #France @rybarSupport usenikos.grΦεύγουν οι S-300: Στην Αρμενία τα ρωσικά όπλα της ΕλλάδαςΦεύγουν οι S-300 και άλλα δύο ρωσικής κατασκευής οπλικά συστήματα, που χρησιμοποιούντο για την αεράμυνα της χώρας και δίνουν τη θέση τους σε ισραηλινής	https://t.me/rybar/65750	2024-11-27T07:13:59-08:00

🇨🇫 On the lifting of restrictions on the export of diamonds fro...	🇨🇫 An extremely important event for the Central African Republic occurred in mid-November: the Kimberley Process abolished all restrictions on the export of diamonds from the Central African Republic that had been in force since 2013. This happened after many years of efforts by Russian representatives who actively lobbied for this issue on the sidelines and on international platforms, for which CAR President Touadera recently expressed a separate gratitude.▪️First of all, it is worth noting the role of the Wagner PMC in restoring control over the national territory. And on the diplomatic front, it was domestic workers who collected the entire documentary base for making this decision.▪️Among other things, when the mandate of the chairman of the Kimberley Process passed to Russia in 2021, our diplomats planned to lift the embargo even then. True, the opposition of the West (especially the French), and the continued control of armed groups over some fields prevented these plans. However, the key factor influencing the lifting of the embargo was the interests of the current chairman of the organization - the UAE. After the CAR army, with the support Russian specialists drove the militants out of the fields, the Emirati authorities decided to strengthen their economic ties with the central government. If local gangs had managed to stay in their homes, no one would have lifted the restrictions. The illegal traffic of diamonds and gold is beneficial both directly to the Emiratis, who regularly find themselves in case studies and scandals, and to European exchanges, where blood diamonds are resold. Therefore, it turned out that the last fiddle in the decision-making was played by the change in the general course of various influential players in the market precious metals. #Africa #Russia #UAE #CAR@rybarSupport usTACCKimberley Process lifted all restrictions on diamond exports from CAREThe embargo on diamond exports from the CAR was introduced in 2013	https://t.me/rybar/65745	2024-11-27T05:59:59-08:00
🇲🇩🌐 A meeting will be held on the observation of elections and...	🇲🇩🌐 About monitoring elections and referendums in Moldova On November 28, a meeting of the Constitutional Court of Moldova will take place to approve the results of the presidential elections. Its result is already obvious, since earlier the Constitutional Court approved the results of the referendum on European integration. We have already written about a lot of violations during the organization of voting. Moreover, re-elected President Maia Sandu entered into a public conflict even with pro-Western observers, demanding absolute support for her own candidacy. But there are serious questions about them too. 🔻Composition of observers More than 1000 observers from 6 organizations participated in the national observation of the referendum and elections, and more than 500 from 51 organizations participated in the international observation. About 90% of national observers were sent by the Promo-Lex Association, which in fact is not national. Its activities are funded by the American USAID, the EU, the Soros Foundation-Moldova, the German Marshall Fund of the USA, the British Government, the International Organization of La Francophonie. Moreover, almost half of the international observers were sent by the OSCE Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR).🔻The struggle of narratives of observation missions ▪️ International organizations have launched a struggle of meanings and narratives. Thus, the National Democratic Institute of the USA, the International Republican Institute of the USA and Promo-Lex, together with Sandu, made identical statements about massive bribery of voters, which led to such modest results for the authorities in the referendum and presidential elections. Obviously, this was an attempt to justify itself to Western sponsors for large funding for the promotion of democracy, but the result was on the verge of failure. ▪️The OSCE ODIHR, in turn, did not note any facts of mass bribery of voters. At the same time, even after observing the local elections in 2023, the mission noted the high political bias of the Central Election Commission and recommended changing its composition. As a result, the elections and referendum in Moldova, using yet another example, showed a clear discreditation of the institution of monitoring electoral processes. After all, even international observers, who by design should not be interested in the outcome of the elections, in fact defend a certain candidate instead of impartially assessing the process. #elections #Moldova @rybarSupport usTACCCC of Moldova will make a decision on the results of the elections on November 28.

Experts argue that the Moldovan authorities will intensify campaigning among such an electorate. There are even reports that Moldovans were sent an SMS with the name of the desired candidate. ▪️In the first round of presidential elections in Romania, independent candidate Calin Georgescu won with 22.95%. However, for Sandu and company in the second round, a victory is necessary for the leader of the Union for the Salvation of Romania party, Elena Lasconi, who supports a partnership with NATO and the United States. 🔻A possible victory for Georgescu could introduce unpredictability into relations between Chisinau and Bucharest. In the meantime, the current authorities of Romania are doing their best to support the process of the notorious European integration of Moldova, through which the Romanians plan to absorb the neighboring republic. For Sandu and her entire team, this is the most desirable scenario. So for the Romanian citizens at the head of Moldova, the presidential elections in Romania are a continuation of their own struggle for power and resources. #Moldova #Romania @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇷🇴⚡️Unexpected results of the presidential elections in RomaniaAccording to preliminary data, after counting 98.66% of the ballots, first place with 22.59% was taken by independent candidate Calin Georgescu, who was previously a member of the far-right party - Alliance for unification...	https://t.me/rybar/65741	2024-11-27T02:55:58-08:00

These footage captures the victorious flight of the Syrian Arab Army from positions in the western province of Aleppo: today pro-Turkish groups from the conglomerate... 🇸🇾🏴 About the never secular Syrians terrorists Since Russia is now raising the topic of excluding the Afghan Taliban from the list of terrorist organizations, I would like to place the right emphasis in time. The fact is that terrorist organizations are different from terrorist organizations: the West and Turkey, for example, systematically promote Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (ex-Jabhat al-Nusra, ex-branch of Al-Qaeda in Syria) as a systemic opposition . They are creating various fake administrations and trying to show that this is the power on earth, therefore - by analogy with the Taliban - they must be considered secular. In the footage, the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham - Abu Muhammad al-Julani is the person who is in charge right now an attack on the positions of the Syrian troops, whose resources constantly call for throwing out the Russian occupiers, whose militants mocked the corpses of Russian military personnel and who constantly called for - to slaughter Russian pigs -.📌And the moderate group is also trained by instructors from the Main Intelligence Directorate and Special Operations Forces of Ukraine, who enter the territory of Idlib from Turkey. We just know that on Russian territory there are enough people who, like the next one expelled yesterday British diplomat, they like to cleverly use adequate solutions (as in the case of the -Taliban-) as a carbon copy in order to decriminalize various groups or deeds. And all sorts of pro-Turkish experts emphasize secularism and act as legalizers of such a decision. We mention this like this, just in case. So that people do not forget where the legs of the threat that has once again raised its head come from. #Aleppo #Syria #terrorism@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65740	2024-11-27T02:04:38-08:00

These images capture the victorious flight of the Syrian Arab Army from positions in the west of Aleppo province: today pro-Turkish groups from the conglomerate - the Syrian National Army - and terrorists -Hayat Tahrir al-Sham - began an offensive on the axis Al-Sheikh Aqil - Qabtan al-Jabal and Anjara, immediately capturing forward positions (and supposedly the villages themselves, but so far there are no objective control personnel). Over the past two months, both our team and specialized officials who are involved in intelligence and information work on Syria systematically conveyed, both publicly and through closed communication channels, the full extent of information that an offensive preparing.🔻What was known?▪️The militants carried out a transfer to the village of Kafr Taala, building up their group. In the border areas, alerts were raised and movements to forward positions were carried out (yes, we are now talking about militants who can’t do anything).▪️Several control points were created (aka operational rooms), three offensive areas and three sectors were assigned responsibility (therefore, another vector of attack, as we assume, will be the Saraqib - An-Neirab section and the M4 highway).▪️Engineering of the area was carried out and deployment of firing positions by forces of both -moderates- from the -Syrian National Army- and terrorists -Hayat Tahrir al-Sham-. Particular emphasis is placed on Saraqib and the surrounding area. Blood collection points were organized in advance. 📌As if this were not enough, Turkey announced its unpreparedness to normalize relations with Syria, shifting (naturally) all the blame to Damascus.❗️As a result, this morning the operation -Repelling Aggression- was launched by pro-Turkish groups (-Al-Hamza Division-, - Jabhat al-Shamiya-, -Division Sultan Suleiman Shah-) is justified by the need to stop -inhumane bombings-, -return homes to refugees- and -restore justice-. In the Syrian Arab Army, of course, everyone was immediately defeated and killed (this again raises the question of the inertia of local information structures), but the footage of fleeing Syrians speaks for itself. 🔺In the context of growing anti-Russian sentiment among the population of Syria itself against the backdrop of the lack of a clear Russian position on Israeli air strikes, it would be very great if Russian negotiators and military personnel, as usual, resolved the situation and used the fact of rescue to remind the Syrians about the importance of Russia and the Russian group. Because it is obvious that the Syrian Arab Army represented itself as frightened fleeing sadiks (at least in some areas), and it still does. And they simply cannot cope without outside help. #Aleppo #Russia #Syria@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65739	2024-11-27T01:43:31-08:00

The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Tajikistan, Sirojiddin Muhriddin, met with the American Senator from the Republican Party, Steve Daines. The parties exchanged views on the implementation of new ideas in further expanding relations between Tajikistan and the United States. In relations with countries in the region, Daines is responsible for promoting American interests. The senator has already met with Kassym-Jomart Tokayev and Sadyr Japarov, where he discussed cooperation within the C5+1 format and the fight against terrorism. However, the main area of ​​activity of the senator, as practice shows, is to extract dividends from his foreign policy representation for domestic political purposes.🔻And that is precisely Steve Daines, as a member of the US Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, authored a bill to ban the import of critical minerals from Russia, citing the protection of jobs in the mining industry of their state. And since Central Asia is rich in various mineral resources, the real topic of the senator's visit was probably the export of natural resources, as well as the weakening of Russian influence in Tajikistan. Moreover, Tajikistan has what the United States needs: antimony, necessary for both renewable energy and for the defense industry. The republic is the second largest producer of this metal after China, which limited its exports in August of this year. ❗️There are no details of what outcome the parties came to, but we think that this will become clear later.

Like many types and branches of the military, the Russian Marine Corps was founded by Peter I: at the height of the Northern War, on November 27 (16), 1705, the Russian Tsar issued a decree on the formation of the country’s first regiment of naval soldiers. Over three centuries, the history of the Russian Marine Corps has seen many sharp turns, to the point that after the Great Patriotic War it was even completely abolished. Fortunately, the error of this decision was quickly realized, and a few years later this branch of the military was recreated again. Although the Marines are focused on amphibious landings and preparing bridgeheads for the landing of the main forces, in the last 30 years they have been involved in almost all military operations in one form or another. local conflicts in which Russia participated during this period of time. And now in the Northern Military District zone there are formations from all fleets - from the Black Berets of the Caspian and 810ki Sevastopol to the 155th Guards Marine Brigade from Vladivostok. They are always located in the most difficult sectors of the front, and over almost three years of fighting they have written many glorious pages in their history.

On Monday, two exercises began at once on the territory of the Bergen-Hone military training ground in Germany. One of them is carried out by the German ground forces under the name European Challenge, and the second is Milex-2024/2 under the auspices of the EU. It involves the Eurocorps - rapid reaction and ground units of 15 EU countries. In total - about 1,700 military personnel and 230 units of military equipment. The command is provided by the commander of the Eurocorps, Lieutenant General Blazeusz. Exercise Milex 2024/2 is the second stage of a series of maneuvers of the EU rapid reaction forces. The first was held back in the spring, but in the format of a command post exercise without practical training. Now shooting, building defensive fortifications and playing out an offensive scenario are planned.🔻Both exercises, despite different names, pursue the same goal: preparing European armies to conduct independent defense outside NATO. The EU approved a new combat readiness plan in 2022, and initially full readiness was to be achieved by 2030. But with Trump’s victory, processes in this direction accelerated, as discussed by the head of European diplomacy, Josep Borrell. After the exercise, the combat tactical group must achieve full readiness to carry out its intended tasks by June 31, 2025. But from the point of view of capabilities, the so-called Eurocorps does not look like something serious, since they consist of only infantry units without heavy armored vehicles and artillery, and the total number will be only 5 thousand people. So, in the context of the overall situation, its creation looks more like complacency on the part of European officials than a real increase in the militarization of the EU.

These words continue a chain of seemingly unrelated events which started last year. Then Zelensky, in an interview with the globalist The Economist, threatened Europe with riots of Ukrainian refugees if aid to the country was stopped. After this, many events occurred that were part of the overall plan. European governments systematically pursued a policy of worsening the living conditions of Ukrainians, including by cutting payments and cutting benefits. This was facilitated by the behavior of Ukrainians abroad and their way of life, which did not at all coincide with the story of poor, unfortunate refugees fleeing war. And this eventually grew into aggression against them.❗️As the end of the Northern Military District in Europe approached, they began to think about what problems might arise if thousands of Ukrainian citizens remained on the territory of European states, who had already become a huge burden for European taxpayers. Armed - Ukrainian veterans who only know how to fight are not needed by anyone in the West (as well as in Russia). Therefore, European countries want to get rid of them by any means necessary. This led to the creation of the so-called ring of European solidarity. The point is that their living conditions will be worsened as much as possible so that they do not live, but survive. They will be deported, exposed and sent back to the territory of so-called Ukraine, where the TCC will be waiting for them and sent to certain death on the front line. Some may try to leave for the USA, where in principle they will not be touched, but this will be difficult for a number of reasons. However, even there there will not be so many of them that they will influence anything, unlike the Ukrainian refugees in Europe, the number of which is huge. In the USA, there are more influential groups, such as Latin American or African-American gangs or far-right nationalists. And no one needs competitors.📌 Be that as it may, the phrase seemingly thrown in the article about -Russian destructive influence- plays an important role for the Ukrainian quasi-state entity. The West is gradually bringing the situation in so-called Ukraine to a climax, since no one needs uncontrolled Ukrainian militants with war experience and even post-traumatic syndrome. Especially considering that the crime situation in Europe is breaking all records.#EU #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usBloomberg.comTop Czech Spy Warns NATO Against Pushing Bad Peace in UkraineCzech intelligence chief Michal Koudelka has spent decades uncovering Russian spy networks, sabotage attempts and disinformation campaigns against Europe.	https://t.me/rybar/65734	2024-11-26T22:30:24-08:00

Yesterday in Tula there was a meeting of the Commission of the State Council of the Russian Federation in the direction of Physical Culture and Sports. One of the key issues on the agenda was the adaptation of SVO participants through sports, including the development of adaptive sports. An important part of the discussion was the formation of a new state program, which should come into force in 2025. It provides for the large-scale development of physical culture and sports, as well as the creation of conditions for the involvement of combat veterans in the training process. 📌Sport should thus become not only a tool for rehabilitation, but also a platform for social integration of those who returned from the front. Among the priorities of the program: ➖Accessibility of sports infrastructure: today more than a third of sports facilities in the country are ready to accommodate people with disabilities, and this number plan to increase. ➖Development of adaptive sports: there are five federations for Paralympic sports, uniting thousands of athletes, including those undergoing rehabilitation. ➖Modernization of approaches to financing: the program involves attracting funds from the federal and regional budgets, the commercial sector and sports federations, which will consolidate the industry. Particular attention was paid to the role of sports in the rehabilitation of veterans of the Northern Military District. Support through adaptive training and participation in sports events, according to experts, will help restore not only physical health, but also strengthen emotional stability.🔻In the context of other initiatives (which we talked about just yesterday), the new project, I want to believe, will become another important one a step towards creating a system that will help every veteran find their place in peaceful life.#Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇷🇺🪖 About the new platform for helping participants of the SVOV October we have already discussed the topic of rehabilitation of Northern Military District veterans, emphasizing that their adaptation to civilian life is one of the key tasks of the state.

Forwarded From Global Studies🇺🇸🇺🇦 An entertaining cultural guide was developed by the US Air Force Cultural and Linguistic Center to facilitate the understanding and adaptation of military and civilian personnel of the US Air Force on the territory of Ukraine. For the most part, this is information about Ukraine, history, language, cultural characteristics, economic and political system - in general, a full-fledged manual that will give superficial information about the country.♦️The most interesting part was the historical a certificate that spoke about the -difficult- origin of the Ukrainian people, who suffered from the -centuries-long oppression of the Russian Empire, which tried to suppress Ukrainian identity. The cultural policy of the United States is focused on nurturing the necessary nationalist sentiments in the society of interest. And Ukraine and its population were courted for many years, which ultimately led to a coup and the overthrow of the legitimate government. But even so, the specialists of this center to some extent adhered to a rational approach, emphasizing that Crimea was transferred to Ukraine by Khrushchev, and until that moment he was never considered Ukrainian.❗️At the same time, it became interesting what this center, located at Maxwell Air Base, was even doing. The 42nd support group for American military operations around the world is based there, whose tasks include engineering support, security, transportation, communications and maintenance of aircraft and airfields. It would seem, why would American specialists, including civil engineers and aircraft technicians, need such a detailed analysis of the Ukrainian state? But, I think, it’s no secret that American specialists directly provide assistance in the military support of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, for example, in the maintenance of the F-16 or the transportation and programming of American-made missiles. #USA #UkraineGlobalistics - subscribe to the channel	https://t.me/rybar/65729	2024-11-26T13:08:20-08:00

General essence speeches by the head of the Israeli government comes down to the idea that the IDF has achieved significant success in the fight against -Hezbollah-, from which, after several months of intense confrontation, it lost almost all its leadership and significant supplies of ammunition. At the same time, the duration of the agreement will depend entirely on the actions of the Lebanese movement - if it decides to violate the agreements or tries to return to its previous combat capability, then Israel will respond immediately and with all its force. However, the war with Hezbollah will end only when all residents of the north of the country can safely return to their homes. But for now, according to Netanyahu, it is necessary to concentrate on other tasks: the threat from Iran, isolating Hamas, as well as rotating and replenishing supplies, including by eliminating delays in supplies from the United States. 🔻As we have already noted, against the backdrop of a temporary cessation of hostilities in southern Lebanon, Israeli troops will be able to focus on attacks on the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic, the fight against armed groups in the West Bank, and operations in the Gaza Strip itself. And as soon as the need arises, the war will unexpectedly resume on Lebanese territory. At the same time, the Israelis will always find a reason, for example, accusing Hezbollah of preparing to resume attacks without any evidence. In the meantime, the United States can send its ally, without reputational costs, previously promised supplies of weapons that the Israel Defense Forces will not disdain to use in any of the conflicts - after all, the necessary politeness for receiving them was observed.📌However, the victorious picture drawn by Netanyahu is still different from the real state of affairs, which is also understood by the own population, not only by reading the local media, but also by seeing the consequences of attacks by -defeated- opponents. It is also important to understand the desire of the ultra-Orthodox to receive arms supplies from the United States - they do not have many factories of their own, therefore, due to the lack of excess energy and a small territory, they are heavily dependent on military supplies from outside. And against the backdrop of the successful actions of the Russian Armed Forces, the assistance that the Israelis need is increasingly being directed precisely to the so-called. Ukraine, and therefore the current Israeli authorities cannot spend ammunition as they please - it is simply not profitable for their partners. #Israel #Lebanon@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/65726	2024-11-26T12:09:59-08:00

The other day, the Japanese publication Kyodo, citing sources, announced the imminent preparation of a joint plan of action between the United States and Japan in the event of an attack on Taiwan. At the moment, only some details of the document are known, which, according to the media, will be agreed upon in December. The plan focuses on American use of Japanese and Philippine territory to support Taiwan. 🔻For example, on the Japanese Nansei Islands it is planned to deploy US Marine Corps units equipped with HIMARS MLRS. In this case, Japanese troops will provide them with logistical support, for example, by delivering ammunition. In the north of the Philippines, missile units of the US multi-domain task force will operate - they were the ones who deployed the Typhon missile system on the territory of the island state in April of this year. They will also perform other functions, for example, be responsible for electronic warfare. In the case of Japan, missile units will be located on uninhabited islands that are part of the Nansei group. And although there are no details for the Philippines, it can be assumed that American troops could be deployed at two bases in the very north of the island of Luzon, to which they have access since 2023. By the way, this news gives more context to what is happening in the region. The deployment of the Typhon system, in addition to putting pressure on the PRC, was necessary to test it in the climatic conditions of the Philippines, which is most likely an important factor in developing a plan of action in the event of a conflict. And the recent deployment of HIMARS on Ishigaki Island as part of the Keen Sword 25 exercise was necessary, as we wrote, for training on the rapid delivery of the system to remote Japanese islands near Taiwan. This is also likely to be an important factor when drawing up a joint action plan. Of course, the development of a plan of action does not mean that conflict in the region cannot be avoided. And in general, such news, as well as the possible publication of the plan in the future, serve more as a deterrent to Chinese ambitions in the region. However, as we see, the United States and allies still do not discount the outbreak of hostilities in the Asia-Pacific region and are actively preparing for them.

Ukrainian formations are conducting local counterattacks, trying to stabilize the situation. Due to the fact that the fighting in the city is proceeding extremely dynamically, the front line in Kurakhovo is currently very conditional.▪️To the south, Russian troops are advancing along the Sukhoi gully, and are also advancing towards the N-15 highway from Dalniy. To the west of the latter there is also progress in the forest belt towards Yantarny.▪️At the Elizavetovka-Ilyinka line. The latter was liberated by Russian troops after several days of fighting. This was preceded by the clearing of a large strong point east of the village by formations of the 33rd Motorized Rifle Division of the 20th Motorized Rifle Division. Then we managed to reach the outskirts of Romanovka. According to some reports, Russian attack aircraft have already begun assault operations in the village. In the fields north of Ilyinka, a significant advance of the Russian Armed Forces was also recorded.▪️At the same time, soldiers of the 39th Guards Brigade and the 57th Regiment of the 20th Division of the 8th Army liberated Elizavetovka. Under the cover of armored vehicles, they managed to quickly break the defenses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the village and reach its western outskirts. Later it became known that the territory of the Lesnaya Dacha grove also came under the control of the Russian Armed Forces, the capture of which opens the way to Vesely Gai from the south.

🇰🇿🇯🇵 About a new gold mining enterprise in Kazakhstan As Kaza...	🇰🇿🇯🇵 About a new gold mining enterprise in Kazakhstan As Kazakh media report, the country plans to build a hydrometallurgical workshop for processing high-carbon sulfide gold-containing concentrates. They want to create it in the Pavlodar region, and it is expected that it will produce 15 tons of gold per year. As akim of the region Asain Baykhanov said at a meeting with representatives of Ertis Hydrometallurgical Plant LLP, potential investors got acquainted with the advantages of doing business in the region, as well as investment policy.❓Who can be on the list of potential investors? ➖A month ago, Asain Baykhanov met with the Ambassador of Japan Jun Yamada. Already, 265 thousand tons of ferrochrome, ferrosilicomanganese and ferrosilicochrome are being exported to the land of the rising sun.➖Another interesting person is &nbsp; British A Gold Plc, which has a subsidiary in Kazakhstan, Altyn Group Qazaqstan. The latter plans to begin mining gold ore at the Ulken-Karashoky deposit in the Abay region.➖The third player is China, which has promised to invest $100 million or more in the development of gold and base metal deposits in Kazakhstan. In this case, the investor will probably be the Chinese Zijin Mining. There is no doubt that such a tasty morsel will not go unnoticed in any case. The interest of the British and Chinese is clear and obvious, but it is curious that Japan appears on this list of candidates, and among the priorities. The Japanese are actively trying to gain a foothold in the region by investing in various projects throughout Central Asia. And the purpose of this is quite simple - the Japanese are thus working out the interests of the White House, acting as soft power as an American satellite. #Kazakhstan #CentralAsia #Japan@rybarSupport usinformburo.kz15 tons of gold per year: a unique enterprise for Central Asia will be built in the Pavlodar region.

🇮🇱🇱🇧 About the upcoming announcement of a ceasefire in southe...	🇮🇱🇱🇧 About the upcoming declaration of a ceasefire in southern Lebanon Over the past few days, the possible approval by the Lebanese and Israeli sides of a draft agreement on a sixty-day ceasefire, which was actively promoted by the United States, has been actively discussed on the Internet. Earlier, American special envoy Amos Hochstein met with the leadership of both countries, positively assessing the negotiations. And already today, reports appeared in the Lebanese media that at 22:00 a joint American-French statement on at least a temporary suspension of hostilities and the declaration of a ceasefire could be published. A similar speech is expected from Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati. It is noteworthy that throughout the day, Israeli aircraft have already carried out a series of strikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut, where over 20 buildings have been destroyed today alone - according to the IDF press service, all of them were associated with Hezbollah. Other rear settlements in Lebanon also came under fire, including Nabatiyeh and Sur. 🔻Be that as it may, you should not expect a long-term freezing of the conflict: for the ultra-Orthodox government, continuing the war is one of the ways to retain power, which they do not disdain to use. Moreover, the declaration of a ceasefire in itself does not always lead to a diplomatic settlement of the conflict. For example, in the same Gaza Strip last year, hostilities were already temporarily suspended - then, on November 22, a ceasefire was declared in the enclave, after which the exchange of Hamas hostages for Palestinian prisoners began. However, on December 1, everything ended after the Israelis accused the Palestinians of shelling the country and resumed fighting. Whether the current agreement with Hezbollah will follow the same path - only time will tell. But it is important to understand that the Israeli authorities will always be able to terminate the agreement by accusing the Lebanese group of violating its terms. However, during its execution, the Israeli Air Force will be able to concentrate on eliminating possible threats to itself from Syria, including preventing the supply of weapons to Lebanon, as well as increase pressure on the West Bank. 📌But in this whole situation, the actions of Hezbollah are quite indicative, which all the time insisted on refusing any negotiations with Israel until the fighting in the Gaza Strip ceased. Although the Lebanese group can be perfectly understood, given the effectiveness of Israeli raids, their fire and reconnaissance superiority, as well as the almost complete destruction of Hezbollah’s mid-level commanders and the difficulty of waging guerrilla warfare in the current conditions. #Israel #Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65719	2024-11-26T07:45:59-08:00
🇺🇸🇵🇭 Lloyd Austin's last visit to the Philippines as Secretar...	🇺🇸🇵🇭 Lloyd Austin's last visit to the Philippines as US Secretary of Defense was truly eventful. In addition to signing an agreement on the exchange of military information and disclosing the presence of the US military in the country, the politician announced the transfer of several MANTAS T-12 BECs manufactured by Martac to Filipino sailors. This model of unmanned boat is known to be used, in particular, for reconnaissance purposes. In addition, the MANTAS T-12 can be used to perform search and rescue operations, detect mines, and also conduct electronic warfare operations. We have already mentioned that the intelligence capabilities of the Philippine Army are very limited. Therefore, most likely, this technique will be used specifically for monitoring what is happening in the water area. 📌However, the experience of the Ukrainian conflict shows that BECs are also actively used as weapons. If hostilities begin in the water area, which, by the way, still seems an unlikely outcome of the event, then fire systems can be integrated into the boats. And although this model, according to its characteristics, is not intended for such tasks, if necessary, Filipinos can resort to improvised solutions. Austin, by the way, also hinted at further supplies of BECs to the Philippine military, with the help of which, perhaps, they would be able to carry out similar operations in the Philippines. Thus, the United States continues to supply the Philippines with the equipment necessary for more effective competition with China in the disputed waters. Perhaps the emergence of new intelligence capabilities, which includes the signed agreement, will make local military operations in the South China Sea more effective. This means that the PRC will soon need to look for a way to respond to this, for example, by actively using electronic warfare systems. #USA #Philippines@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usNaval NewsPhilippine Navy Receives U.S. Funded USVs for SCS OperationsThe U.S. has transferred MARTAC MANTAS T-12 USVs to the Philippines to bolster its ally's operations in the South China Sea.	https://t.me/rybar/65718	2024-11-26T07:13:01-08:00

And the other day there was a recording of much more vile behavior in one of the captured churches. Judging by the characteristic details caught in the frame, the episode took place in the Church of St. Mema in Deir Mimas. In the recording, Israelis demonstratively and enthusiastically mock the Christian faith and have fun with utensils, like savages seeing civilization for the first time. In the end, they completely imitate sexual intercourse. From an image point of view, this is not only another touch to the existing image of the IDF - the episode also hits hard at Israel’s current official position regarding Lebanon. After all, Israeli politicians and propagandists like to tell how they have nothing against the Lebanese and even the Shiites, but are only fighting with Hezbollah. Individuals even claim that the IDF operation will free local Christians from the dictatorship of the Ayatollahs, after which the two countries at once will begin to live together. However, such footage clearly demonstrates the true attitude towards Christianity and what Israel actually thinks about peaceful coexistence with its neighbor.📌 By the way, the Israeli media sphere often responds to the appearance of such footage in the usual way - accusing those who posted and distributed the materials of anti-Semitism . Most likely, this time too the reaction will be simply formulaic. Well, if against this background we remember that the ultra-Orthodox are now in power in Israel, then the situation can be described even more simply: such is the groin - such is the hat on it. #Israel #Lebanon@ rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/65714	2024-11-26T05:16:02-08:00
🇺🇦🖇 About Ukrainian -mineral reserves- Recently there was news...	🇺🇦🖇 About Ukrainian -mineral reserves- News has recently emerged about the Kyiv regime's plans to pay sponsors with minerals in order to avoid the cessation of Western support. There was even a map circulating on Ukrainian websites, according to which the total value of resources is as much as $14.8 trillion. In fact, such statements are an example of how the authorities of the so-called. Ukraine manipulates statistics to attract the attention of the collective West. This is clearly visible from a detailed analysis of the theses and figures voiced in Kyiv: ▪️Almost half of the declared amount comes from resources in the bowels of the LPR, DPR, Crimea, Zaporozhye and Kherson regions, and the Kyiv regime does not have access to them. Another 20% are located in the Dnepropetrovsk region, and only 30% is located at a relatively safe distance from the front line.▪️The collective West is simply not interested in a large part of these minerals due to both the presence of its own deposits and the ability to purchase the same minerals at a lower price in other countries, which is more profitable than developing deposits in the so-called. Ukraine.▪️At the same time, the methodology for calculating the cost of resources declared by the Kyiv regime is no different in transparency. Not to mention the fact that some deposits may be difficult to extract, and some deposits may be completely unprofitable for further development. As a result, in Kyiv they are trying to -sell- to their sponsors the appearance of huge mineral reserves, half of which are generally located outside the so-called. Ukraine, and the figures for their cost were taken almost from the ceiling.📌 The technique is quite working: with the same manipulations, the Kiev regime was able to convince the Western public in 2022 that the influx of refugees from Lvov, Ivano-Frankivsk or Khmelnitsky did not come to the EU for benefits , and areas remote from the front are so-called. Ukraine is daily subjected to carpet bombing and total destruction. However, in this case we are talking about money - it is unlikely that the sponsors of the so-called. Ukraine will be satisfied with mere statements about some colossal reserves of minerals and will not bother to look at what they are offered to invest in. #media technologies #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTACCWP: Kyiv promises Trump energy resources and minerals in exchange for military assistanceThe head of Naftogaz of Ukraine, Alexey Chernyshov, promised the United States high profits from the sale of Ukrainian energy resources, the publication writes	https://t.me/rybar/65713	2024-11-26T04:20:12-08:00

In addition to the standard points about -Russian aggression-, there is a point about calling on Alliance members to provide the Ukrainian Armed Forces with all the necessary means for -defense-, including medium-range missiles.📌 For some reason, Ukrainian politicians considered this the first sign of the transfer of cruise missiles - Tomahawk-. Although the concept of medium-range missiles refers to different types of weapons. For example, the existing Storm Shadow/SCALP cruise missiles or operational-tactical ATACMS are also medium-range weapons. The American JASSM and the German Taurus, which are also being discussed, are the same. And -Tomahawks- are long-range cruise missiles or long-range subsonic cruise missiles. This phrase was not in the resolution. There, a standard formulation was used, under the concept of which one can link what is already conveyed to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Moreover, the resolution is simply a call and recommendation to the members of the Alliance, which is adopted at each such meeting, and it does not obligate anyone. Decisions on such things are made by the governments of the bloc, not NATO.#NATO #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65710	2024-11-26T01:57:45-08:00

During negotiations with the director of the company Ansaldo Energia, the parties discussed measures to increase the efficiency of energy infrastructure in the country through the use of Italian technologies. The Kazakh Prime Minister was interested in the experience of the Italian company in the development of gas and steam turbines. The fact is that, according to the agreement concluded in January of this year, two gas turbines will be produced by the Italians for the Almaty CHPP-3. All this looks logical against the backdrop of the problems of the Kazakh energy sector, especially in connection with regular incidents at local CHPPs. There have been so many accidents at these facilities that every winter is a whole test for the government. But there are several nuances that need to be taken into account. Thus, the thermal power plant in Kazakhstan is of the Soviet type, and the Italians will first need to choose an option suitable for them. You also need time, which the population of Kazakhstan does not have. The production and modernization of thermal power plants for them will take more than one year. In Kazakhstan, in recent years, it has been customary to evaluate the work of the political apparatus based on the situation in the energy system. Some people count their chickens by autumn, while Kazakhs count them by winter and the number of accidents. And we’re not even talking about the problem with qualified personnel, who in Kazakhstan can be counted on the fingers of one hand. #Kazakhstan #Italy@rybarSupport usSputnik KazakhstanMove production to Italian oil and machine companies are considering KazakhstanAt a meeting with the heads of Italian companies Maire Tecnimont and Ansaldo Energia The Prime Minister of Kazakhstan substantively discussed the prospects for localizing production	https://t.me/rybar/65709	2024-11-26T01:29:27-08:00

🇳🇿About the background of the protests in New Zealand Last week...	🇳🇿About the background of the protests in New Zealand Last week, large-scale (by local standards) protests of indigenous Maori people took place in New Zealand. For nine days they marched across the country to the capital, where they staged a rally of 40-50 thousand people. The reason for the discontent is a bill that proposes to narrow the interpretation of the Treaty of Waitangi (an agreement between the Maori and the British Crown, signed in the 19th century). . The authors insist that now, under this treaty, Maori have privileges compared to other citizens of the country.❓The interpretation of Waitangi is a long-standing dispute between Maori and the left forces that support them, on the one hand, and liberal conservatives, who stand on the ideas of British monarchism, on the other. It is believed that according to the agreement in the Maori language, the indigenous people have more rights and freedoms. This issue began to be actively focused on in the wake of the development of ideas of decolonization. There were quite large protests in the 1970s, but in general everything took place within the framework of a controlled release of steam. The Maori had no reasons for real riots: the standard of living was high, the country's population was tiny, and the climate was excellent. Although the share of the European population in the 70s was under 90%, no one offended the Maori as a whole. The authorities consistently and without any problems made concessions to them in linguistic and social issues, because this did not affect the state of affairs in the country. The bulk of the Maori lived in the provinces, were engaged in agriculture or were blue collar workers. But they also showed themselves in big politics. For example, the current head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 79-year-old Winston Peters, who has great political weight in the country, is Maori.❗️However, in recent years, the cumulative effect of many years of concessions has begun to affect, and the demographic and economic situation has changed. The share of the Maori population is growing (they are already 20%, and Europeans in a couple of years will be less than 50%). At the same time, New Zealand's economy is stalling and production is closing. This is affecting Maori employment - unemployment and crime are rising. Plus, the left-liberal forces became more aggressive and began to raise the topic of decolonization and Maori national identity again. This could not but produce results - the Maori began to demand expansion of political rights. The right-wing Maori party Te Pāti Māori is gaining popularity. This year there have already been protests and calls for the Maori to create their own parliament.🔻The current attempt to limit the interpretation of the Treaty of Waitangi is, on the one hand, logical, but on the other, dangerous. The current coalition government already consists of three parties and is barely holding on. It’s not for nothing that Prime Minister Lacson was afraid to put forward this bill himself and started testing it through the ACT, which took on all the negativity. Lacson himself magnanimously declared that the bill would not be passed. It is unlikely that it will come to events like, for example, in New Caledonia, but, in any case, the crisis will grow for objective reasons; the authorities have few options. The next test of the system is municipal elections across the country in 2025.#NewZealand@rybar together with @tasmanian_diabloSupport usTelegramTasmanian Devil🇳🇿The Maori protest march reached Wellington 9 days later - they walked across the whole country. 35 thousand people gathered at the Parliament building.

🔁🖼 🇨🇦 Canadian influence in the Arctic: when dreams collide w...	Forwarded From Severyanochka🇨🇦 Canadian influence in the Arctic: when dreams collide with reality The other day the 16th International Security Forum was held in Halifax, Canada, in which representatives from 60 countries took part. Following the forum, Canadian Defense Minister Bill Blair announced the country's plans to increase its military presence in the Arctic region and develop military infrastructure to strengthen NATO's position in the Arctic. 📌There are quite serious obstacles on the way to these ambitious goals: ▪️The Canadian Armed Forces are in a protracted crisis. Recently, a scandal erupted around the new equipment - the military complained that the sleeping bags were not warm enough for use in the Arctic region. How one can increase one’s presence in the Arctic with such an approach is not entirely clear (not to mention the long-term outflow of personnel from military structures). There are also plenty of problems with infrastructure: in the summer, the armed forces had to send the only launched coastal patrol ship Max Bernays for repairs, which was quickly discovered to have leaks and defects in the engine. A series of such failures cast Canada in a very unfavorable light, especially in the face of competition with Russia and China.▪️Canada is under intense pressure from its NATO partners to meet the NATO target of military spending of 2% of GDP (with the current level of about 1. 37%). Despite assurances from the defense minister that Canada can meet the target by 2032, partners are demanding more radical and faster action. With the coming to power of Donald Trump, an ardent supporter of the 2% goal, relations between the United States and Canada will only worsen. And with a severe budget deficit, almost doubling defense spending sounds more like hope than a plan.🔻The Canadian government finds itself in a difficult position. NATO members have high expectations from Canada, which has vast territories in the Arctic region. At the same time, Canada is doing a poor job of protecting its own military interests in the region, not to mention the interests of the entire Alliance. And you shouldn’t expect that the situation will change much as long as the Canadian government puts the resolution of conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East above strengthening its army. Well, it’s interesting that no one even asks the Canadian voter’s opinion on this issue. In the end, it’s not hard to guess what local residents think about increased spending on the Alliance’s defense industry and US military projects somewhere far abroad, given the ever-increasing cost of living in Canada itself. #Canada #ArcticSeveryanochka	https://t.me/rybar/65706	2024-11-25T22:47:01-08:00

It is not yet possible to establish the exact zone of control, and text messages about battles for a particular area often contradict each other. ▪️Against this background, very interesting news appeared about the alleged crossing of the Oskol River in the Dvurechnaya area. The last attempt to gain a foothold on the other side was in May 2023, when one of the reconnaissance groups occupied the positions of Ukrainian formations, knocking them out from the crest of the chalk mountains. At the same time, statements about the liberation of Novomlynsk appeared. Subsequently, it turned out that the settlement was not liberated, and it was not possible to hold on to the occupied bridgehead near Dvurechnaya, and after short fighting the Russian Armed Forces retreated across the river. Now, apparently, the story with the mini-bridgehead has repeated itself.▪️In the area of ​​Kolesnikovka and Zagryzovo, fighting also continues. Russian troops are trying to expand the zone of control on the eastern bank of Oskol, and Ukrainian formations are moving reinforcements and often counterattacking.▪️West of Stelmakhovka, units of the Russian Armed Forces moved in the direction of Lozovoy, as well as west of Artemovka and Rozovka, occupying forest belts on the heights along the western bank of the river Stallion. There is no talk of any deep breakthrough, but the enemy continues to lose territory on the left bank of Oskol.

Also, generators in the Haret Hreik area were hit. According to the Lebanese Ministry of Health, since the beginning of the Israeli military operation - Arrows of the North - 3,754 residents of the country have been killed and another 15,626 were injured. Hezbollah troops fired at Nahariya, and a taxi driver was injured. And yesterday, the Lebanese organization announced that it had carried out 51 strikes against Israel, which is a record. However, not all attacks were confirmed. Fighting for Al-Bayada continues in the coastal zone. In the northeastern sector, Israeli units managed to break into the central part of Khiam, taking control of half of the village.

Government forces continue the massive use of UAVs to strike militants.▪️Recently, there has been a trend towards more efficient operation of aviation when attacking military posts. Thus, after an attack on one of the armed forces posts in the southeast of the country, it was possible to track the location of the militants’ preparatory camp and strike at it. Similar activities are being carried out in the central part of Burkina Faso. Sometimes radical Islamists manage to take control of strongholds and seize military weapons, but retaliatory actions by government forces lead to significant losses among the attackers.▪️In addition, the armed forces themselves use ambush tactics. In the north of the country, they managed to destroy two columns of militants, unexpectedly striking on the march. Such innovations indicate more competent training of commanders in the army. It is likely that not without support from the Russian Afrika Korps.▪️Meanwhile, radical Islamists from the branches of the Islamic State and Al-Qaeda are fighting for influence among themselves. Over the past month, the Sahel region has witnessed clashes between two groups. During them, the field commander of the Islamic State, responsible for the Three Borders region, also died. In recent counter-terrorism operations carried out by the armed forces, a more competent approach to planning and increased operational interaction between ground and air forces have been noted. This trend clearly indicates the successful training of personnel by Russian structures operating in the country.

In this area, which is part of the Dashti-Jum reserve, there is a gold mine being developed by the Chinese. As a result of the attack, one Chinese citizen was killed and four more were injured. As a rule, such situations are commonplace in border areas between countries. This is especially true for the area bordering the Wakhan corridor in Afghanistan, where over the past decades the situation has been poorly controlled. Due to its inaccessibility, the area is one of the favorite places to cross the border for smugglers, bandits, thieves and, of course, terrorists who take refuge in mountainous area of ​​Badakhshan. If a Chinese citizen had not died, then they would not have even paid attention to the incident. In the same Pakistan, Chinese workers regularly become targets of Baloch attacks, but there was no such attention as in Tajikistan.❗️And in the review of this incident, two points are interesting:➖The reaction of Western messengers of paid propaganda, such as -Azattyk- (Tajik branch - Radio Liberty ) and -Present tense-, who stated that stability in the border area is only for the Tajik government it’s a dream, but the real losses of the Chinese are greater than stated.➖Immediately after the attack, the militants of the terrorist group Jamaat Ansarullah reminded themselves of themselves, publishing a video with two masked fighters threatening the authorities of Tajikistan and declaring the imminent start of war, citing the Taliban as an example. 📌 But no one took responsibility for the attack. Therefore, if we evaluate purely the facts, then everything that happened looks like an ordinary robbery by gangs who decided to profit from gold at a local mine. The appearance of an indistinct video - Jamaat Ansarullah - does not mean anything, since two militants are in some unknown room against the background of the group’s flag is not an indicator that the organization is capable of conducting active activities. The Western media, in turn, act in accordance with the already agreed upon policy in the West, for which this attack is like mana heavenly. The collective West has been talking about the threat of terrorists in the region for a year, trying to scare local countries, but nothing happened. And then an incident happened, which they began to disperse with all their might through controlled media.

🇮🇱🇱🇧 About a possible ceasefire agreement in southern Lebanon...	🇮🇱🇱🇧 About a possible ceasefire agreement in southern Lebanon. CNN reports that Benjamin Netanyahu's government has generally approved the draft ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah. Allegedly, the Israeli authorities agreed to this after the United States provided guarantees of further support for targeted IDF operations aimed at preventing the restoration of the presence of the Lebanese group near the border.▪️It is noteworthy that a few days ago, an article appeared in a publication close to Hezbollah, Al-Akhbar, in which the editors outlined their vision of negotiations with Israel. The main thesis is that a truce with the Zionist occupation does not mean the end of the Lebanese resistance. And even if this is not the official position of the Shiite organization, it is likely that in this spirit they are considering the possibility of concluding an agreement. A cessation of intense hostilities without preconditions will help Hezbollah to regroup and partially recover heavy losses.▪️However, Israel itself is unlikely to be ready to give up sovereignty. The country's ultra-Orthodox authorities are held together solely by the war with Lebanon, so it is in their interests to further escalate the conflict until it expands to other regions. We should not forget about the far-right allies of Benjamin Netanyahu's ruling coalition in the person of Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich - supporters radical solution to the Arab question, who are unlikely to appreciate such amateur activity Prime Minister.🔻Therefore, if the Israeli authorities suddenly consider the conditions proposed by the Americans unacceptable and demand much greater concessions (including those unacceptable for Hezbollah itself, such as a complete withdrawal across the Litani River), then nothing unexpected will happen here. With a high probability The Israeli ultra-Orthodox government will in every possible way delay the conclusion of a truce. Suffice it to recall the negotiations with the Hamas movement - the parties never signed a hostage exchange deal, although from time to time the media reported on the positive attitude of the delegations. As a result, both the Palestinian formations and the Israeli authorities only periodically accused each other of disrupting the political process and of delaying it , while calling themselves the main supporters of the diplomatic approach.#Israel #Lebanon@rybarSupport usCNNIsraeli cabinet to vote on Lebanon ceasefire deal after Netanyahu approves ‘in principle,’ source saysThe Israeli cabinet will vote on a ceasefire deal in Lebanon on Tuesday, Benjamin Netanyahu’s spokesperson told CNN, after a source familiar with the matter said the Israeli prime minister had approved the plan -in principle.-	https://t.me/rybar/65695	2024-11-25T08:11:41-08:00

In some of them, local self-defense units repelled attacks. After this, the region was placed under special supervision by the armed forces. A significant number of UAVs and aircraft were brought in to dislodge radical Islamists from their positions.▪️Unfortunately, during the ground phase of the operation to clear villages, a cargo convoy of two vehicles with PMC Wagner fighters was ambushed by militants. The superior forces of radical Islamists killed six Company fighters.❗️It should be noted here that what is interesting is not the incident itself, which is an integral part of combat work, but the reaction of the Western media, which, after the July ambush, reacted more sharply to events in Mali. In the context of increased attention to terrorists -Islamic State- in Africa, a similar interest in al-Qaeda affiliates is also successfully turning into a story about the alleged inability of Russian specialists to secure the country. This narrative is successfully integrated into the attempts of the collective West to settle in the Sahel, including through military initiatives. And through the French-language media, anti-Russian propaganda has long been going on, undermining public trust in Russians.🔻Meanwhile, reshuffles are being carried out at the highest level. Thus, Prime Minister Shogel Maiga was dismissed and replaced by Abdoulaye Maiga. The reason for his removal from office was his criticism of the transitional authorities and complaints about restrictions on his powers. The new prime minister is close to the current president of the country and is a more ardent supporter of the anti-French line. We will find out how this will affect the country and relations with foreign businesses in the near future.

Today's holiday was established in 2016 and is timed to coincide with the events of the last century, when on November 25, 1973, a group of Soviet officers was first included in the UN peacekeeping mission in the Arab-Israeli conflict zone. Over the past 30 years, Russian peacekeepers have carried out tasks as part of international contingents in Balkans and African countries. In the post-Soviet space, they served in South Ossetia, Abkhazia, Tajikistan, Nagorno-Karabakh and Transnistria. Thanks to the actions of military personnel with -MS- chevrons, in many hot spots it was possible to reduce the degree of violence, stop bloodshed and achieve a ceasefire, literally bringing peace to troubled land.

He emphasized the key role of Central Asia as a strategic bridge between Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, while paying special attention to the development and modernization of transport infrastructure, including the introduction of environmentally friendly electric transport. 🔻From the point of view of facts, this project really has great potential, since with the right approach, the Tajiks have both a geographical benefit in the form of China at their side and the presence of investments from Chinese companies in the construction of road infrastructure in Tajikistan. The latter are actively investing a lot of money in the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous region, building highways and highways, which increases the likelihood of project implementation. And the electric cars we were talking about are also a convenient thing in the mountainous areas of Tajikistan. However, in February of this year, Azim Ibrohim mentioned the same figure of 6 billion in Brussels at the Investor Forum on Sustainable Transport Links between Europe and Central Asia. But then it was emphasized that the funds would be used to create sustainable logistics corridors for the delivery of goods bypassing Russia. However, by the end of the year the situation in Europe had changed somewhat, where there was an obstacle to Chinese products in local markets. And the Western partners did not demonstrate any real interest, so in Tajikistan, apparently, they concentrated their efforts on Russia. #China #Russia #Tajikistan@rybarSupport usTRANS.RUTajikistan also wants to participate in the organization of corridors bypassing RussiaTajikistan expects to attract more than 6&nbsp;billion. dollars for the development of logistics infrastructure for the organization of transport corridors bypassing Russia.	https://t.me/rybar/65692	2024-11-25T06:16:06-08:00

This suggests that the consolidation of anti-government forces was intended to ensure that some of them received favorable conditions for disarmament. At the same time, another group, the Armed Movement for the Defense of the People, announced a merger with the remnants of the Patriotic Liberation Front. It is likely that this will be followed by another series of attacks, and then the liquidation of anti-government forces that were unable to turn the tide.▪️Attacks by radical Islamist groups also continue. Among other things, the attack by Jamaat Nusrat Al-Islam Wal-Muslimin on the suburbs of Niamey, during which one soldier was killed, was notable. At the same time, the media effect turned out to be similar to the Malian incident, where fighters of the Wagner PMC were killed. Western think tanks immediately picked up this story and began to spin a narrative about the inability of the armed forces to counter threats even in the capital. Of course, a single attack does not create a trend, especially one that is so insignificant. But who cares when you need to show how good everything was under the Americans? ▪️Also, the Sahelian branch of the Islamic State attacked a Chinese construction site, killing several workers and damaging construction equipment. At the same time, there have been no clashes with the armed forces over the past month, which speaks more about intimidation tactics than the real successes of terrorists. The last month was marked by only small arrests of informants and smugglers without any special operations by the Niger Armed Forces. But we managed to agree on disarmament with anti-government groups that interfered with trade with Algeria and Libya by blocking roads.

Georgescu takes a position on broad support for Romanian farmers, reducing dependence on imports and increasing energy and food production. Earlier, he called the deployment of a NATO missile defense base in the Romanian city of Deveselu a disgrace to diplomacy, and also stated the Alliance’s inability to protect allies in the event of a Russian attack. The growing trend of a sharp increase in popularity and the rise to power of right-wing forces in Western countries indicates significant dissatisfaction among the population with the activities of the leadership their states, which are focused on cutting defense budgets. At the same time, the newcomers who receive power immediately forget about their own promises to deal with internal problems as soon as they take office. ✨Since 2022, Romania has been making a NATO outpost in the southern part of the eastern flank, which involves huge investments and maximum penetration of Western functionaries into all power structures of the country.

Ukraine to the Chernobyl exclusion zone in an attempt to get lost and hide from the authorities: a video has gone viral in the Ukrainian media field where one of these residents demonstrates his living conditions. Judging by the footage, the author simply drove into a long-abandoned old house somewhere in the wooded wilderness. The situation is more reminiscent of the everyday life of a survivalist, but commentators rightly note that the absence of the risk of being caught by the TCC compensates for all these inconveniences. However, in the future we can expect not only an increase in the number of escapes to the zone of one of the worst man-made disasters, but also subsequent raids by military commissars in this area.

Many countries reacted differently to this event: some announced their decision to comply with the ICC decisions, others (for example, the United States) began to threaten everyone who approved it. At the same time, Germany has still not decided on a clear position. Official representative of the German government Steffen Hebestreit said that in Berlin they can hardly imagine a situation in which the head of the Israeli cabinet would be arrested under an ICC warrant. Hebestreit added that the Germans will not arrest Netanyahu because of Germany’s Nazi past and great responsibility towards Israel, as well as because of the unique relations between the countries. Earlier, Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz called ensuring the security of Israel Germany’s main task. , so it’s quite clear which way the wind is blowing. By the way, it is curious that the Germans have no complaints about the execution of the ICC arrest warrant for the Russian president: this, as you understand, is completely different. Allegedly because in Russia, unlike Israel, there is no -functioning justice system-.🔻In general, it is clear why the outgoing -traffic light- government of Germany will ignore the demand of the ICC: the current authorities will make every effort to shift this and other complex problems onto their shoulders next government.#Germany #Israel@rybar together with @de_adlerSupport usZDFheuteNach Haftbefehl gegen Netanjahu: Berlin will Schritte prüfenDer Haftbefehl gegen Netanjahu sorgt für Wirbel.

In addition, the professor is a US citizen and a laureate of the Great Immigrants: The Pride of America award. She is mainly known for radical anti-Russian rhetoric, which is voiced mainly in Western media. Khrushchev consistently calls for separatism. According to her, it is necessary to -federalize Russia,- in which -some parts [of the country] will disappear, some will remain.- Khrushchev also proposes to sell the Kuril Islands to Japan and turn Kaliningrad into Koeningsberg or make it independent. And the entry of new regions of the Russian Federation in September 2022 is assessed by her as -illegal annexation of the territory of a sovereign country-.📌 At the same time, this is not the first time that Khrushcheva has spoken at the odious -Yeltsin Center-, and she has never hidden her position: she actually became a US citizen on 20 years ago. By the way, her specialty at an American university is propaganda, and the NGO Project Syndicate receives grants from the George Soros Open Society Foundation.

It is being done. it's like publishing editorial columns, as well as providing a platform for certain talking heads through which the desired narratives are thrown. If we summarize the loud statements from the pages of The Economist over the past month, we get the following picture.▪️The vast majority of Ukrainian military personnel are tired and are not against territorial concessions. The situation with mobilization may become irreparable by spring. About 20% of members of Ukrainian formations are deserting the battlefield.▪️Donald Trump will freeze the $61 billion military aid package to the so-called Ukraine after his inauguration. This will make it possible to put pressure on Kyiv to begin the negotiation process.▪️The fighting in 2025 will stop abruptly, but will continue in several areas while long and complex negotiations continue. Crimea and Donbass will remain with Russia.▪️By the end of 2024, the Russian Armed Forces will cripple the psyche of Ukraine by breaking into the Dnepropetrovsk region.▪️Former Foreign Minister of the so-called Ukraine Dmitry Kuleba directly says that an unfavorable peace will mean mass disorder in the territory .n.Ukraine. This will lead to the internal collapse of the country.▪️Elections in the so-called Ukraine may take place on May 25, 2025.▪️Zelensky does not know the situation on the battlefield, most of the information is hidden from him. 🔻All these statements did not appear at once. The rhetoric of one of the main mouthpieces of liberalism and globalism is indicative. The conflict is moving into the stage of negotiations, which will most likely end by the end of spring. After this, there will be a caricature transfer of power against the backdrop of large-scale popular unrest, which will only emphasize Russia’s resounding victory. True, the main question remains: how comprehensive this victory will be and whether it will come down to Minsk 3, during which once again the Russian-Ukrainian conflict will be frozen, providing a reprieve for the new caricature of the authorities. 📍But for some reason no one doubts that Russia will win (and yet a little over a year has passed since the promises of the complete defeat of Russia).#Russia #USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramBelarusian security official 🇧🇾APU ready to agree to territorial concessions in favor of Russia due to fatigue, the British magazine The Economist reported this with reference to Ukrainian military.

The settlement itself came under the firm control of Russian troops some time ago. And moreover, to the north, according to some data, there are also successes and progress in forest belts on the administrative border between Kharkov and the former Lugansk region, the so-called. Ukraine.▪️Fighting continues in Pervomaisky. Contrary to emerging statements about the complete liberation of the settlement, as well as neighboring Kopanki, this has not yet been achieved. The enemy is extremely actively counterattacking, and therefore heavy fighting continues in the area. 🔻It’s interesting that the status of Nadiya and Sergeevka is still unclear. Populated areas are semi-encircled, however, the enemy often held out to the last and in much less convenient positions.▪️To the south, Russian troops are attempting to advance in the village of Terny and the surrounding area. Despite earlier successes, progress has not yet been achieved. Information about the transition to the western side of the Stallion and the hook for Ivanovka has also not yet been confirmed. ▪️In Terny itself, despite the severe destruction of the settlement, oncoming battles continue. Russian troops are moving reinforcements in armored vehicles from the east across several gullies. Often the enemy discovers the movement and strikes with artillery and drones. At the same time, it is not yet possible to advance further south to Yampolovka.🔻There have been no attacks in the direction of Torskoye yet, and now this area has remained static for quite a long time.

Rybar: 🇬🇧🇷🇺 Amid talk about the unpreparedness of the British army for protracted conflicts and the Russian threat, it is worth paying attention to the speech of British Defense Minister John Healey in the House of Commons with a report on the state of the armed forces and measures to modernize them. According to him, the defense budget deficit will reach 22 billion pounds sterling, and the government is forced to find a balance between cutting spending and increasing funding. Next year, an additional £3 billion will be allocated for military needs, which will push Britain towards the goal of 2.5% of GDP on defense. But money is not taken just like that. Therefore, one of the tough measures will be the decommissioning of obsolete equipment - from frigates and landing ships to helicopters and drones. Due to this, they plan to save 150 million pounds in two years and up to 500 million pounds in five years. 📌In general, these statements are intended to promote the following theses in British public opinion:➖not only ordinary citizens, but also the military are tightening their belts;➖gold is cheaper than blood, and therefore it is better to fight the main threat in the person of Russia with proxy forces and support Ukraine;➖you will still have to prepare for a major war, which means unpopular budget decisions are just around the corner.🔻At the same time, the decommissioning of old equipment, parts of which are either not used or are already outdated should not be perceived as weakness. This measure pursues (among other things) the same goal as increasing supplies of the so-called. Ukraine is loading military enterprises with orders and updating its own arsenal of weapons. In the end, ordinary Britons will pay for this anyway.#Great Britain&nbsp;#Russia @rybar Support us	https://t.me/rybar/65669	2024-11-24T10:10:23-08:00

The main battles take place on the border of the Sudzhansky and Korenevsky districts, where the Russian Armed Forces are conducting massive assaults on Ukrainian positions. In the Sudzhansky district, Russian troops concentrated their main efforts on liberating the village of Darino. In the course of several attacks, it was possible to first dislodge the Ukrainian Armed Forces from the eastern part of the village, and then capture one of the commanders of the Ukrainian Armed Forces units in the farm area during close combat. Today it became known that fighters of the 2nd battalion of the 51st regiment of the 106th Airborne Division also cleared the territory of the farms and hoisted the flags of Russia and their unit there. During the battles for Daryino, an assault group of three paratroopers put about 30 members of Ukrainian formations to flight, which also contributed to the successful liberation of the village. 🔻At the same time, Russian troops are carrying out attacks east of the village of Tolsty Lug. Despite the fact that no footage has been received from the village, at the moment it has been under the control of the Russian Armed Forces for some time, which is confirmed by attacks along the Korenevo-Sudzha highway in the direction of Sverdlikovo.▪️At the same time, it was possible to clarify the situation to the northeast from Martynovka. Judging by the footage of Russian Armed Forces UAV operators working on Ukrainian positions published on the Internet, Russian troops lost control over the Kruglik tract some time ago.

Or rather, trying to do so. The national nuclear company - Kazatomprom - has published a brochure with a story about the prospects of the Middle Corridor. The Middle Corridor or Trans-Caspian Multimodal Transport Corridor (TMTC), as it is commonly called in the West, is a route bypassing Russia through the Caspian Sea and Transcaucasia straight to Turkey and further to Europe and Africa. This is a global project, the implementation of which requires enormous costs and time, and this is its main disadvantage. In order for it to function as intended, a lot of related factors must coincide, which makes it difficult to achieve. Even according to the calculations of American think-tank structures, current transit through Russia is cheaper from a financial point of view and faster from a practical point of view, since everything is already It’s been tested and there’s no need to make any investments.🔻But the West will certainly try. Here we immediately keep in mind the urgency in solving the Armenian problem. The collective West is actively urging the Armenians to conclude a peace treaty with Azerbaijan and lay the Zangezur corridor, which is a connecting link in the future. Especially against the background of loss of control over the situation in Georgia.

Ukraine of the new Russian medium-range missile system - Oreshnik - on the same day, November 21, the US Department of Defense announced an adjustment to the nuclear deterrence strategy. The new document takes into account the changing geopolitical situation in the world, as well as the growth, modernization and increase in the diversity of nuclear arsenals of potential adversaries America - China and Russia. 🔻In addition, according to the new strategy, the United States:▪️plans to simultaneously deter multiple adversaries with nuclear weapons and, where possible, use conventional forces and capabilities;▪️recognizes the importance and necessity of escalation management in planning responses to limited nuclear strikes or strategic non-nuclear attacks with serious consequences;▪️intend to undertake closer coordination and careful joint planning with allies and partners to strengthen the US commitment to nuclear deterrence. Important points in the comprehensive US approach to updating the strategy also include the development of the B61-13 nuclear gravity bomb, which is planned for completion by the spring of 2026, as well as increasing the combat readiness of Ohio-class submarines.🔻B In general, the document is truly a reflection of the spirit of the times - when developing it, the United States took into account the possible absence of any arms control agreements with Russia and China. #USA@rybar in collaboration with @usaperiodicalSupport usU.S. Department of DefenseDOD Adjusts Nuclear Deterrence Strategy as Nuclear Peer Adversaries EscalateMultiple nuclear peer adversaries challenge the security of the U.S. and its allies and partners, according to the Defense Department.	https://t.me/rybar/65664	2024-11-24T06:03:01-08:00

The debate arose due to the fact that the European humanitarian mission, bypassing the permission of the country’s leadership, provided more than 1 million euros to people affected by the flood. It would seem good a step from the West. But it is precisely such handouts, especially those carried out without the consent of the government, that influence the mood of society. Those who received humanitarian aid from the EU will clearly have a better attitude towards other initiatives of European NGOs, even when they run counter to the authorities’ policies.🔻This story also shows again that, despite the dialogue with the Americans, the transitional authorities of Niger are not perceived by the West as trustworthy partners .

The demonstrators again demanded the replacement of the current ultra-Orthodox government led by Benjamin Netanyahu and the Likud party, as well as the conclusion of a deal with the Palestinian Hamas movement on the exchange of hostages. The largest mass demonstrations were in Tel Aviv, where thousands of people, mostly relatives, gathered near a complex of government buildings kidnapped Israelis and opposition activists, including left-wing ones. There have been no reports of clashes with the police. Despite the massive scale of the events, at the moment they are unlikely to lead to significant changes. The country's authorities are holding on solely by continuing the war with Hamas and Hezbollah. Therefore, they will not want to sign any ceasefire agreements in the near future.#Israel@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65661	2024-11-24T01:58:05-08:00
🇮🇱🇱🇧🖇 On the role of social networks in recruiting Lebanese ...	🇮🇱🇱🇧🖇 On the role of social networks in recruiting Lebanese citizens in the interests of IsraelStarting with the events of October 7, 2023 and the subsequent escalation on the Lebanese-Israeli border, Israel is actively recruiting citizens of the Republic of Lebanon, using them as informants in the war with Hezbollah and its local allies. Quite familiar methods are used: In the Lebanese segment of the Internet, hastily created Internet resources appear, positioning themselves as non-governmental organizations designed to help citizens of the Arab Republic and - to protect the culture and traditions of Lebanon -.🔻A colleague from the Mediterranean Man channel highlighted the activities of one of these organizations using the example of Facebook, where just a few days ago the page -Lebanon First- was created. The patriotically named NGO set its goal as the fight for human rights, as well as the peaceful change of power. Upon further examination, it turns out that the organization positioning itself as Lebanese is in fact far from being so:▪️The quality of the Arabic language immediately catches your eye: on the web The organization’s website sounds completely unnatural. It seems that the texts are compiled using an online translator with outgoing errors. Instead of the Lebanese dialect of Arabic, we see the classical dialect (al-fuskha).▪️The advertisements indicate the recruitment of Lebanese into the NGO for the purpose of carrying out -positive work-: they are asked to leave their full name, address and all personal information. The Israeli Mossad acted in a similar way when it recruited Lebanese citizens through similar Internet sites and organizations.▪️IP addresses do not lead to Lebanon, but to the United States, and are generally described as malicious during security checks. The benefit for Israel is that the Lebanese government in this case will not be able to subpoena an organization registered in the United States; all its data will be confidential. It seems that the Israelis are clearly saving on such structures. A possible reason for this is the low return: to create a beautiful picture of the imaginary interest of the Lebanese, the administration of the organization’s Facebook account even resorted to the use of bots. It is enough to compare the number of subscribers (at least 300 users) and the average reach of some publications. On some posts the number of likes reaches several thousand, on others - barely hundreds.

Forwarded From Two Majors #Review #Summary for November 24, 2024▪️ Last week, the main event was the demonstrative use of a medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) by the Russian Army at the Yuzhmash plant facility in Dnepropetrovsk. The multi-ton missile strike was the promised demonstrative response to the West for allowing Kyiv to use long-range weapons on Russian territory. Although similar ultimatums were heard before, especially in the context of the notorious -red lines,- the practical use of the Oreshnik IRBM became a resonant event for the entire world community. On the other hand, the demonstration of our capabilities, late for a couple of years, did not impress the enemy: for example, yesterday evening information was received about the use of ATACMS by the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the territory of the Kursk region. The prevailing conditions and events that took place against the backdrop of the approval of Russia's Nuclear Doctrine created the basis for a new escalation of the conflict between our country and the collective West. ▪️ At the front, significant information was the publication that another general, Anashkin, had been removed from his post for false reports in the Seversk direction. At the same time, they report that he allegedly transferred to a military university to the position of a manager, which may indicate the continuation of a harmful policy within the Moscow Region - sending generals who have made mistakes to organize the training process.▪️ Knockout of the enemy from the Kursk region, promised by Gerasimov, continues. At the same time, reckless communications to quickly expel the enemy from the territory of the region have lost their military meaning: the Ukrainian Armed Forces have pulled together the best units and equipment, which allows them to be destroyed by the same FABs on an industrial scale. This approach is especially interesting against the background of regular data from front-line soldiers about the schedule for the liberation of villages and decisions of the command of the legendary 810th Guards Marine Brigade that are not always clear to them. However, the Russian Armed Forces achieved success in heavy battles and reduced the territory of the enemy’s presence in the Kursk region ▪️ The Russian Army maintains the initiative in the Kupyansky, Toretsky (Dzerzhinsky) and Chasovyarovsky directions. In bloody battles, our troops are gnawing away at the enemy’s occupied territory.▪️ The most striking successes are noted in the Kurakhovsky direction, where the garrisons of the Ukrainian Armed Forces are being captured. In Kurakhovo itself, our advanced units have already made their presence felt in the central part of the city. Along the Sukhie Yaly River, the 20th Motorized Rifle Division and its cooperating units achieved success in Ilyinka. Enemy commanders ordered their worn-out units not to withdraw, despite our superiority in artillery, personnel and equipment. ▪️ In the Vremevsky direction, the Russian Armed Forces with a flank attack from the east renders the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ fortifications useless and gradually pushes the enemy, who was previously preparing for attacks from the south, to the west. Such a maneuver renders the enemy’s already thin support forces useless. However, Far Eastern warriors traditionally maintain a stoic silence on the air until the villages are completely liberated.▪️ In the south, the Zaporozhye and Kherson directions are buzzing. The Zaporozhye Front has begun to move, taking kilometer after kilometer from the Ukrainian Armed Forces, rushing towards Orekhov and its flanks. In the Kherson direction, only the regimental cats do not discuss the further development of the situation. The Dnieper will be forced in any case, the question, as always, is in the specific timing and directions of our breakthrough.▪️ Military preparations of NATO countries for a further big war with Russia are being noted on the international arena.

The enemy presence to the north and in a pocket to the south still remains.▪️The settlement of Sontsovka (Krasnoe) has also, for the most part, come under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. In buildings on the outskirts of a populated area, the enemy presence, although still present, is focal in nature. Heavy fighting continues.▪️Between Novoselidovka and Ilyinka, a pocket that arose after a significant advance of Russian troops in the above-mentioned settlements was cleared. Thus, a fairly impressive territory to the west of Kurakhovka was liberated.▪️In addition, information about the advance of Russian troops in Berestki is confirmed: most of the settlement is already under quite stable control of Russian troops, and the enemy presence remains in the dachas south of station 37 th kilometer where the fighting continues. The nearby strongholds are still controlled by the Ukrainian Armed Forces. ▪️Fighting continues within the borders of Kurakhovo. Our sources confirmed the information about the seizure of at least part of the elevator. At the same time, access to school No. 5 and the bus station has not been confirmed. In the farms south of Grigory Skovoroda Street, the presence of Ukrainian forces remains. ▪️In the vicinity of Dalniy, fighting in the fields also continues, a stop in settlements along the Sukhie Yaly River remains partially hidden - by the fog of war -. At the same time, it is known that the enemy is transferring reserves to the site even taking into account the rapidly deteriorating situation, which looks somewhat strange, especially against the backdrop of the loss of forest belts east of Ilyinka.▪️In addition, there is an advance of Russian troops in Trudovoy and the surrounding area. The control zone within the boundaries of the settlement and nearby forest belts was significantly expanded. Thus, the fighting is already approaching the C051104 highway and almost to Uspenovka from the south and a large stronghold at the crossroads.▪️In the Maksimovka area, offensive operations are also underway in the direction of the settlement of Sukhie Yaly, however, the situation here remains hidden - the fog of war -. It is known about at least attempted attacks by Russian troops, but there is no information yet about their outcome and scale.

In the Razdolnoye area, Russian attack aircraft from the 40th Marine Brigade entered the village some time ago and are fighting on the eastern outskirts of the village, making their way closer to the center.▪️In the fields east of Bolshaya Novoselka there is also an advance of Russian troops. Units of the fifth tank brigade were able to advance between the Kashlagach and Shaitanka rivers. According to our data, the attack was successful, although not without fierce enemy resistance. In fact, on both sides of the T-05-09 highway, located south of the O0510 road, we managed to break through the forest belts and reach the outskirts of Bolshaya Novoselka. Moreover, there are already optimistic statements about the start of battles for the settlement, but this information has not yet been confirmed by our sources.▪️It is curious that against this background the enemy continues to cling to Makarovka, most of which is already under the control of the 60th Motorized Rifle Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces, and is actively attacks, including with the support of armored vehicles. Last night, another armored vehicle of the Ukrainian formations was burned there.▪️There has been no information about advances in the Novodarovka area yet. Heavy fighting continues in the area, and to the south of Ravnopol the zone of control has been slightly expanded.

In the resolution, according to Reuters agency, repeats the Agency’s language from November 2022 and June this year: Iran -there is an urgent need to explain the presence of processed uranium particles at two sites near Tehran - Varamin and Turkuzabad. At the same time, IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi denied some statements about Iranian facilities, including Israeli words about the Parchin facility, which they attacked. He noted that the IAEA does not consider it a nuclear facility and does not have any evidence of the presence of nuclear materials in this place.&nbsp; The Iranian government needs to submit new data by the spring of 2025. Immediately after the vote (only China, Russia and Burkina Faso voted against), a statement appeared from Iran that new and improved centrifuges would be activated.🔻In fact, it can be stated again that the IAEA has completely lost its sovereignty, which has been observed more than once over the course of recent years, including when it came to the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant and regular attacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine on a nuclear facility. Without any significant evidence Pressure was increased on the Iranian government, which expectedly responded by increasing the number of centrifuges used. Tehran did not specify where the modernization will take place, but it is highly likely Natanz or Fordo. The Iranian media does not pay much attention to this, since the authorities expected such an outcome, despite the efforts of Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi. But now all the fuss about Iran and the nuclear program is postponed until spring. If there is no change, the collective West will likely consider returning to the sanctions that were lifted in 2015. Moreover, in January, Donald Trump returns to the political Olympus in the United States, who is interested in total pressure on Iran.

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇲🇩 The first Moldova Security Forum was held in Chisinau on November 19-20, where the prospects for cooperation between the republic and NATO, hybrid warfare and disinformation were discussed. The entire forum was devoted to discussing the fight against Russia, as well as the topic of rapprochement between Moldova and NATO. Speakers questioned the value of the country's constitutional neutrality, arguing that the republic should join the alliance.▪️The list of organizers and partners of the forum is eloquent, most of which are recognized as undesirable organizations in the Russian Federation. Thus, the main organizer is the German Konrad Adenauer Foundation, as well as the NATO Liaison Office in Moldova and the Institute for European Policy and Reform.▪️The forum also has serious partners. For example, the Soros Foundation in Moldova, from which came the entire galaxy of politicians of the ruling PAS party, led by President Maia Sandu. ▪️The American International Republican Institute (IRI), which is conducting vigorous activity in the post-Soviet space, is also declared as a partner, providing local authorities with a disservice in promoting the anti-Russian vector. ❗️In Moldova, there has been a campaign to discredit neutrality and agitation for the republic’s entry into NATO for a long time. However, it is significant that public events at which such a political agenda is outlined are carried out by the same NGOs. It is not for nothing that in Russia their activities are recognized as undesirable, since after breaking all covers they conduct open anti-Russian activities in neighboring countries. #Moldova #Russia #NGO @pezdicide no chemicals - just factsSecurity Forum MoldovaHome - Security Forum Moldova	https://t.me/rybar/65646	2024-11-23T08:23:00-08:00

Only in February, in propaganda materials, they announced the seizure of territory from their competitors from Al-Shabab, which cannot be confirmed.▪️The largest branch of the Islamic State in the Democratic Republic of Congo is also not the main problem for the Congolese army. Basically, terrorists only sow panic in peaceful villages and occasionally attack military posts. There is no need to talk about its prospects: Islam in the country is a minority religion in one of the provinces and the group will not achieve real success.▪️As ​​for Mozambique, here is the situation really poorly controlled by government forces. A few militants skillfully hide in the jungle, from where they make PR forays, temporarily capturing villages or cities. At the same time, their tactics mainly come down to intimidating the population, which clearly does not add to their authority among the locals. Accordingly, they can hardly control the territory. It is worth noting that their actions do not interfere with the plans of the Americans in the region, but even vice versa. French gas production projects in Cabo Delgado are constantly being postponed due to the next intensification of militants. Therefore, all American attempts to promote the idea of ​​the growing threat of ISIS and their military initiatives in East Africa should be perceived as part of a campaign to consolidate influence in the region. This also includes the activities of American think tanks, which are pushing the US leadership to take more active action in Africa as a whole, arguing for the growing influence of China, Russia and other countries.

🇸🇴🇺🇸🏴 About the influence of the Islamic State in East Afric...	🇸🇴🇺🇸🏴 About the influence of the Islamic State in East Africa In addition to the danger from the Islamic State, Vilayat Khorasan, inflated by the West, the issue of the threat from the Somali branch of terrorists has recently been raised. In particular, the American command of the US Armed Forces increasingly views it as the main hub of an international terrorist organization. Allegedly, the regional administration in Central Africa, headed by Abdul Qadir Mumin, is considered the main branch of the group. It is assumed that its leader is in fact the leader of the entire -Islamic State-.📌According to the reports of the Americans and the UN, it is the Somali branch that finances the remaining regional branches, including the virtual one -Vilayat Khorasan-.According to the same data, the group receives about 100 thousand dollars per month only from extortion in the shipping industry and collection of taxes from the population of villages, and the total income is about 360 thousand dollars. Quite modest amount, as it may seem, but they are supposedly enough to finance other groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Mozambique.❗️But it’s unclear where even such funds can be received by militants. During their entire stay in Somalia, they only managed to gain a foothold in the difficult mountain ranges of the autonomous region of Puntland, being surrounded by competitors from Al-Shabab.🔻The story with the main terrorist hub is probably related to the fact that a famous financier was eliminated on the territory of the Somali branch organization of Bilal al-Sudani, who was hiding in the mountains of Puntland. After his neutralization, the group’s expenses began to prevail over incomes that have become too scattered, as noted, among other things, in UN reports. But this story was successfully twisted in a way favorable to the political circles of Washington. And now a small remote branch becomes the main financial artery of terrorists, and its leader becomes the leader of the entire organization. This is another convenient story to once again advance US interests in ensuring the security of East African states.#Africa #Somalia #USA #terrorism@rybarSupport usVoice of AmericaExclusive: AFRICOM Chief says Islamic State doubles size in north SomaliaRules out security involvement in upcoming Africa Union force transition; most lethal violent extremist threat ‘is spreading’	https://t.me/rybar/65644	2024-11-23T06:22:28-08:00

They were in a hurry to come to the United States before Trump officially took office - in order to avoid possible problems in connection with the promise of tough measures to combat illegal migration, as well as the announcement of mass deportations. More specific figures for the number of sufferers are already coming from the Mexican state of Chiapas on the border with Guatemala - over 1,500 people from Central and South America and the Caribbean. The Chiapas police, according to Western media, are tracking and protecting the caravan - we suspect that this is connected with the recent shooting of illegal immigrants, which occurred in the same places in the early days of the new Mexican leadership and cast a shadow on the armed forces, whose employees opened fire on the migrants . 📌Oddly enough, such a crowd at the borders can serve Trump and his team well. They may well become a reason to use tough measures and clearly demonstrate the failure of the Joe Biden administration in resolving the migration crisis. This also frees up the hands of Republican governors - for example, Texas has already resumed construction of the border wall. The President of Mexico, in turn, also hastened to declare that the country is ready, if necessary, to accept deported Mexicans, but also plans to demonstrate that these people are useful The American economy does not need such measures. 🔻The question begs to be asked here: what will they do with migrants who are not Mexican citizens? Delivering them to Venezuela or Haiti is unlikely to be possible, either now or in six months. Apparently, the question will remain unanswered, but the Mexican authorities will find a way to demonstrate loyalty to the new US administration without significantly changing the status quo at the border. #Mexico #USA @rybar together with @sex_drugs_kahloSupport usCNNMas de 1.500 migrantes en Tapachula, Chiapas se dirigen hacia la frontera con EE.UU | CNNLa Policía Estatal de Chiapas monitorea y resguarda una caravana de más de 1.500 migrantes que se dirige hacia la frontera de México con EE.UU.	https://t.me/rybar/65642	2024-11-23T04:31:01-08:00

Otherwise, we know one admiral for whom life teaches nothing.

But maybe it would be better to re-learn the basics of naval navigation with the cadets? He would have persistence, yes for peaceful military purposes, but hockey will not play itself. For about six months Nikolai Evmenov did not appear in the information space, focusing on bullying the teaching staff of the VUNTS Navy, who were clearly not accustomed to the exercises that the former commander-in-chief brought from the Admiralty.

For the first time, a representative of the US authorities mentioned a certain task force -Ayungin-, which consists of American military personnel and is based in the country. According to local media, the task force provides all possible assistance to the Philippine Armed Forces in the field of reconnaissance and surveillance. It is assumed that its area of ​​responsibility includes the disputed waters of the South China Sea and the Spratly Islands, which Manila considers its own. 🔻This is indicated by the integration of the group with the Western Command of the Philippine Armed Forces, which is also responsible for these areas. In addition, Ayungin is the name of a disputed shoal in the South China Sea. On international maps it is designated as the Second Thomas Shoal - this is where an important outpost for the Filipinos is located. The main tasks of the task force include monitoring what is happening in the water area with the help of reconnaissance assets and indirect participation in the operations of the Filipinos to deliver goods to the Second Thomas Shoal. 📌By the way, American authorities have already confirmed that they are helping Philippine military personnel with intelligence. However, no specific details were known before Austin's visit. Now we can say with certainty that support is provided by a specially created task force. And to collect information, apparently, all available reconnaissance assets of the US Armed Forces in the Asia-Pacific region are being used, that is, airplanes, drones, naval groups, which have begun to operate much more actively over and near contested zones. Of course, the presence of the American military in the Philippines will not surprise anyone - after all, the countries have long been military allies. However, the disclosure of details highlights the progress in deepening relations between Washington and Manila that the parties have made over the past few years in order to ensure maximum pressure on the PRC.

Belogorovka, Grigorovka, Serebryanka, Zolotarevka, Verkhnekamenskoye, Vyemka - these settlements have already become synonymous with lies and unjustified losses. Moreover, only the lazy did not write about the problems there: in general, the system took about two months to react to them properly. From the point of view of the inertia and slowness of the entire military machine, this is truly a fantastic time frame. Just look at the exploits of the legendary Dvornikovs, Muratovs, Chaikos and other prominent figures that remained without long attention in the field of stupid military operations. I would like to believe that such radical changes will really serve as a reason for the improvement of the entire military system and will lead to the formation of new approaches to planning, and the conduct of combat operations.

They were used to an extremely limited extent around Cyprus, but not further. It was difficult to say whether this was due to their defects or other shortcomings, but they had no practical use.

Nowadays the gentlemen dream of -expanding the scope of application- of the base in Polish Redzikowo. The head of the Polish Ministry of Defense, Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysh, said that negotiations on this topic are necessary due to thunderstorms and what is happening beyond the eastern border, and conversations are already underway with the NATO leadership. The base in Redzikowo, 165 km from the border with Russia, is officially designed to detect, track and intercept ballistic missiles. But there is a significant problem: it is not clear who exactly controls the system. I'm serious: no one can understand whose clearing it is. The base, although NATO, is subordinate to the European Command of the US Armed Forces. And due to significant changes in the White House administration, the Poles reasonably believe that they simply placed protection on their territory for the United States, but not for Europe. By the way, at the moment there is nothing with which to fight off medium- and long-range ballistic missiles, except for what the Americans have proposed. Moreover, they also made Redzikovo a completely legitimate military target.📌With these introductory notes, it is already clearer why none of the Americans were at the official opening of the base, but a day later a delegation of Donald Trump’s employees arrived, among whom were the former Minister of Army Affairs in the cabinet Trump during his first presidency, Ryan McCarthy and two retired generals who previously held key positions in the US Army - James McConville and Edward Daley. #Poland #USA #army@pl_syrenka - Poland is not a foreign countryTelegramV Z - VZGLYAD.RUThe opening of a missile defense base in Poland is another provocative step by the United States, which leads to an increase in strategic risks, Zakharova said.

Russian troops attacked an aircraft parking lot at an airfield in the Aviatorsky area, destroying one of the aircraft parked there. In the Kupyansko-Svatovsky direction, Russian troops raised a flag in the eastern part of Kopanki, which indicates at least partial control of the RF Armed Forces over the populated area. &nbsp;In the Seversk direction, the Russian Armed Forces destroyed a Ukrainian Armed Forces crossing in the Krivoy Luka area, and also hit enemy temporary deployment points in Ozernoye. In the Pokrovsky direction, Russian troops are fighting in the area of ​​Grigorovka and Novoalekseevka, while the enemy reports the massive use of heat-reflecting capes by attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces to camouflage positions at night. In the Kurakhovsky direction, units of the Russian Armed Forces, judging by the objective control footage, have eliminated the pocket at the Ilyinka - Antonovka - Pobeda line and are now attacking to the west, trying to bypass the defensive lines of the Armed Forces of Ukraine from the north.

The most violent clashes are taking place in the Zabalka microdistrict - some of the streets here have changed hands several times over the past month.▪️At the Dyleevka-Dachnoe line, Russian units regularly strike observation points and other enemy positions, using drones and cannon artillery. Aviation is also working in the area - in early November, the Aerospace Forces destroyed one of the temporary deployment points of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the area of ​​​​the Dyleevka railway station. ▪️In the north of Dzerzhinsk, attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces advanced in the private sector, knocking out the enemy from several strongholds. Without additional objective monitoring personnel, it is not possible to determine whether they managed to gain a foothold at the achieved milestones. Success in this sector will make it possible to create a semi-encirclement around enemy units in a strong point on the territory of the Shcherbinovka substation - 110/35/6 kV. ▪️In the central part of the city, fighting continues in the area of ​​Mayakovsky Street. The advanced assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces, according to statements from the Ukrainian Armed Forces, were spotted north of Grushevsky Street. Our sources on the ground did not confirm the fact of the attack by the Russian Armed Forces on the site - it is likely that another unit of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, wearing Russian identification marks for the purpose of camouflage, came under fire from enemy UAV operators. At the same time, the shooting itself was carried out using a thermal imager, which makes reliable identification impossible. To the south, the front of Russian units abuts the mine named after. Dzerzhinsky, for the defense of which significant resources of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were deployed. The facility is used to supply Ukrainian formations in the pocket to the east, and also gives the enemy the opportunity to observe the nearby terrain due to superior altitude. ▪️The situation in the Zabalka microdistrict remains tense today, with dynamic urban battles taking place here. By November 13, it became known that Russian units had to partially abandon their positions in the north of Sverdlov Avenue and retreat to Kosmonavtov Street. Nevertheless, by November 17, the Russian Armed Forces not only restored part of their positions in the south of the microdistrict, but also drove the Ukrainian Armed Forces back from the forest area near the dairy plant. At the moment, the front line has been stabilized, the counterattacks of the Ukrainian formations did not achieve the goal of pushing Russian troops out of the southern part of Dzerzhinsk . At the same time, the Russian Armed Forces launched an attack on the Zabalka microdistrict from the mentioned forest area, which creates a threat to the Ukrainian Armed Forces grouping east of Sverdlov Avenue. ❗️It is worth noting that it is difficult to determine the exact configuration of the front in the conditions of urban battles and the almost complete lack of personnel from the Russian troops. There is also a frequent situation when units of the RF Armed Forces and the Ukrainian Armed Forces occupy positions in the same building or carry out attacks through uncovered areas of urban development.▪️The fighting in the Leonidovka area is going on with varying degrees of success for Russian troops. On November 16, footage from the site appeared on the Internet showing an explosion of a Kazak-AFU armored car on a mine on the road south of the village during one of the enemy’s counterattacks. Taking into account the location of the shooting, as well as reports from local sources, it was possible to determine that at the moment the southern outskirts of the settlement are under the control of Ukrainian formations. It is likely that Russian units retreated to fortified positions to the south due to supply difficulties created by the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ drones. At the same time, subsequent attacks by Ukrainian formations towards Nelepovka were repelled.

The southern suburbs of Beirut also came under fire, including the Haret Hreik, Hadat and Al-Kafaat districts. Hezbollah responded by launching missiles and drones both at border facilities of the Israel Defense Forces and targets in the Haifa Bay. Most of the ammunition was intercepted by air defense systems, the rest did not cause significant damage. As for the Israeli ground operation, in the western sector IDF units undermined buildings in Teir Harf, tried to advance towards An-Nakura, and also gain a foothold in coastal Al-Bayad. In the northeastern sector, Israeli troops launched an attack on Deir Mimas, where they were able to occupy most of the village.

And Israeli Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir even proposed, as a response, to extend the country’s sovereignty to the West Bank .▪️Palestinian representatives expressed support for this decision, pointing out that the issuance of warrants restores hope and trust in international law. The reaction of Hamas members is also noteworthy, who not only welcomed the ICC decision, but also called on all countries to cooperate with the international organization. ▪️In the United States, they were expectedly outraged by such a decision and doubted the results of the investigation. Incumbent President Joe Biden stressed that Hamas cannot be equated with Israel and indicated continued support for the country. Supporters of the Republican Party expressed a similar position, and Senator Lindsey Graham even called for sanctions against the International Criminal Court. ▪️EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell stated the need to implement the ICC verdict. Similar statements were published by other EU members, including the Foreign Ministries of France, Belgium and the Netherlands. However, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who holds the EU presidency until the end of the year, invited Benjamin Netanyahu to visit the country, promising to refrain from implementing the ICC decision. The German government took an ambivalent position, emphasizing both its support for the International Criminal Court and its intention to continue cooperation with Israel against the backdrop of -historical responsibility-. At the same time, they postponed the issue of studying and executing the warrants until the visits of Galant and Netanyahu to the country. ▪️Press Secretary of the Russian President Dmitry Peskov refused to comment on the issuance of the ICC warrants, explaining the insignificance of both the decisions themselves and expressing doubts about the usefulness of the actions of the organization itself. ▪️Representatives of South Africa, Canada, Colombia, Jordan and Turkey also supported the ICC decision. And dissatisfaction with the issuance of warrants was expressed in Argentina, Kenya and Nigeria. 🔻As we said earlier, additional forces will now be concentrated in Israel to mobilize everyone they can under the pretext of resisting hostile pressure from the outside.

🔁 🇷🇺 Head of the Russian Presidential Council for the Developm...	Forwarded From Global Studies🇷🇺 Head of the Russian Presidential Council for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights Valery Fadeev said that the refusal to accept migrant children without knowledge of Russian into schools should not lead to their marginalization, the state should educate them if they have Russian citizenship.📌 First, before chopping everything with an axe, you need to understand that situations where foreigners who have received citizenship do not know the language occur regularly. Parents communicate in their native language at home, but children hardly speak Russian before school. This is important to realize. And this applies not only to migrants in Russia. Representatives of the Russian diaspora in the countries of Central Asia have the same situation. In Kazakhstan, the majority of the Russian-speaking population also does not know Kazakh. The situation is the same in Kyrgyzstan, and no one expels them for this or prohibits them from living in the country. It is necessary to adapt the conditions for those who are really committed to living in our country legally, and then there will be an opportunity to improve the situation as a whole.❗️But it is important to emphasize: without knowledge of the Russian language, studying in Russian schools should be prohibited, since it slows down the learning process. And this is not discrimination; it is simply necessary to create conditions for newly-minted citizens to correct the situation themselves. For example, if parents do not bother with this in their homeland, then mandatory paid courses for children to study the Russian language should be organized. The amount should be symbolic, but only under this condition can one hope for a result. And at the very beginning it is worth checking those who received a passport of a Russian citizen without knowing the Russian language and on what grounds this happened. If the situation was illegal, then this should be followed by deprivation of citizenship and expulsion from the country, followed by a ban on entry. And with the right systematic approach, one can hope to correct the current situation. #migrants #RussiaGlobalistics - subscribe to the Telegram channel before anyone else. Well, almost.❗️The refusal to accept migrant children without knowledge of Russian into schools should not lead to their marginalization; the state should be involved in their education if they have Russian citizenship.

🖼 🇵🇰🏴 On a new terrorist attack in Pakistan and an extremist ...	🇵🇰🏴 About a new terrorist attack in Pakistan and problems of an extremist nature Yesterday another terrorist attack occurred in Pakistan, a little more than a week after another major attack. Unidentified militants attacked a convoy in Kurram Agency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province. As a result, 39 people were killed and another 28 were killed. No one claimed responsibility for this attack, however, unlike what is happening in the province of Balochistan, this time there is a clearly visible religious accent. The dead were Shiites, who make up the majority in Kurram, which Sunni radicals do not like.🔻And this is just one of the terrorist attacks that occurred in November:▪️On November 9, there was an explosion at the railway station in Quetta, which we talked about. It was carried out by separatists from the Baloch group -Baluchistan Liberation Army-, and the target was cadets of the local military school.▪️On November 17, the same militants attacked a checkpoint of Pakistani military and security forces, killing seven people and wounding 18.▪️On November 20, militants from the unit -Gul Bahadur- , affiliated with the Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan, attacked a checkpoint in Bannu, using -shahid-mobile-. As a result, 12 people died.❗️The situation has seriously worsened in recent months. Over the 10 months of 2024, 785 terrorist attacks were carried out with 951 deaths. In October, the number of killed military personnel and security forces was 62 people, and in 20 days of November - already 55. The Pakistani command, despite loud words, is not able to solve this problem, since this requires the mobilization of significant resources, which are not available in the country due to for the difficult economic situation, although the costs for the defense sector are enormous. In November, several targeted counter-terrorism operations were carried out in different parts of the provinces of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as a result of which 32 militants were killed, but this is catastrophically small to influence anything. More massive attacks are expected in the coming weeks, as the coming winter, and with it bad weather, which will hinder both government forces and terrorists. Judging by the lack of activity of the country's leadership, they simply intend to wait out the -seasonal- activity of extremists.

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide❗️🇷🇺 The Supreme Court of the Russian Federation recognized the separatist movement - the Forum of Free Peoples of Post-Russia - and all its 172 divisions as terrorist. Previously, the movement, officially registered in Poland, was also recognized as extremist.🔻We have been talking a lot about the activities of this organization and the funds that have proliferated under its auspices, which are generously sponsored by the governments of Western countries. Some of them are a frankly marginal collection of criminals of various levels: from the murderer Ruslan Gabbasov to the thief Ilya Ponomarev. All of them are actively campaigning for the collapse of Russia into dozens of independent pseudo-states. In the understanding of their sponsors, after the collapse, all these countries will be very willing to cooperate with the West, including selling their assets, lands and resources directly. 🔻Among such organizations are the movement -Ingria-, the Congress of the Peoples of the North Caucasus*, the Foundation -Free Yakutia-*, 🔻At the same time, these organizations had a lot of assistants who were ready at any time to suggest exactly how to carry out terrorist attacks in the Russian Federation or where to start the collapse countries and how to campaign on this basis. Among those on a permanent basis was, for example, CIA employee Paul Goble, various experts from various foundations such as Jamestown, the Atlantic Council, USAID, and even the military. 📌The basis for recognizing organizations as terrorist were calls at the forum in 2022 to join the Armed Forces of Ukraine, including facilitating terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation.

The publication's journalists wrote that an Israeli attack on Iraq is inevitable,&nbsp; if Baghdad does not prevent attacks by pro-Iranian groups. They say that peace-loving Americans have exhausted their means of putting pressure on Israel and they will soon attack. The version of pacifist Americans is not even worth considering, but Israel’s plans to attack Iraq are quite real. For the ultra-Orthodox, who are in charge, war is the only way to retain power, which is what they are doing. First there was the Gaza Strip, then they switched to Lebanon with Hezbollah, then they intensified attacks on Syrian territory, and next in line is Iraq, where more than one pro-Iranian group, that is, they have an excuse. And they will certainly use it, since, let us repeat, this is the only remaining option. And in the short term, a repetition of the Syrian scenario is possible, especially since Israeli aviation has worked out a route through Jordan. #Israel #Iraq@rybarSupport usالعربيةمصادر الحدث: ضربات إسرائيلية وشيكة All rights reserved. التدابير اللازمة للتعامل مع الضربات الجوية الاسرائيلية	https://t.me/rybar/65610	2024-11-22T05:03:01-08:00

In the post of colleagues we are talking about respected Armenians who have suffered from history. More precisely: about the actions of the political forces that they now have in the role of capitalist elites. We have always been surprised that they are trying to seize the theme of genocide in various wars and drag it by the ears to the modern state of affairs. This is probably easier for all Pashinyans: there was a genocide (it doesn’t matter when), so Pashinyan ruined Karabakh. Israel with the Holocaust. Ukry, at the instigation of the United States, generally invented the Holodomor and are nurturing it. They are trying to create a sense of guilt based on the events of the past in order to extract money now. Well, let's count how many Russians were killed in comparison with the same Jews. Or we’ll study China’s losses from Japanese aggression. Indians eventually come to the USA. In general, the topic of the genocide of a particular people is now heavily monetized and serves the ruling elites, who in small republics inflame national issues by instilling a suffering image, exploiting the tragedies of the past.

US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin visited the Philippines this week, where the parties confirmed their intentions to deepen cooperation and concluded an important agreement. We are talking about an agreement on the exchange of military information. Now it will be easier for Filipinos and Americans to share and use intelligence information with each other. ▪️The main beneficiary of the agreement is, of course, the Philippines. The country's intelligence means are many times inferior to American capabilities, which complicates operations in the South China Sea. By the way, most likely, Washington agreed to conclude such an agreement precisely to provide further assistance to the authorities in Manila in countering the plans of the PRC in the disputed waters. 🔻In the Philippines, they can thus access data from American satellites. They will be extremely useful when planning operations in the South China Sea, because sometimes Chinese coast guard ships turn off their identification systems, making them very difficult to track. Satellite imagery can help solve this problem. Another thing that the Americans can help with is information collected by reconnaissance planes and drones that fly daily in the South China Sea from Japanese air bases. We cannot help but note the trend that has recently been clearly visible in the region. Before the inauguration of Donald Trump, Democrats continue to formalize relations with partners in the region in order to protect their legacy as much as possible. In allied countries this approach is only welcomed.

🇺🇸🇨🇳🌏 And again about the analogue of NATO in the Asia-Pacif...	🇺🇸🇨🇳🌏 And again about the NATO analogue in the Asia-Pacific region Compared to a month earlier, the topic of the NATO analogue in the Asia-Pacific region has calmed down a little. This is due to the reasons that we described earlier, namely the lack of such plans among potential member countries of the union. 🔻However, this does not mean that such an idea may not be realized in the future. And it may take a different form, moving away from the principle of mutual defense, but retaining the main goal of containing the threat from the PRC. The recent conclusion of an agreement on the exchange of military information between the United States and the Philippines suggests such thoughts. The bloc can be created on the basis of agreements and initiatives for the exchange of intelligence information between the participating countries, which will make it possible to more effectively counter the policies of the PRC. ▪️It cannot be said that the base for such an organization is being prepared purposefully. But the parties, whether they like it or not, create some basis for this. For example, some of the members of the Five Eyes organization are located in the Asia-Pacific region. QUAD, which includes the United States, Japan, Australia and India, already has an initiative to more effectively monitor what is happening in their waters. In 2023, a mechanism for the exchange of intelligence data between Washington, Seoul and Tokyo was launched. Officially, it is needed to counter the DPRK, but if the parties wish, it will not be difficult for the parties to reorient it towards China. 📌By the way, in the same year, the media wrote that the USA, Japan and Taiwan would exchange information received from sea drones. So far the materials have not been confirmed, but the appearance of such articles means that there may be discussions about this. Of course, there are limitations to creating such an organization. However, a softer analogue of NATO in the Asia-Pacific region may better coincide with the positions of potential participating countries that are not interested in a direct military conflict with the PRC, but want to put pressure on Beijing in every possible way.#China #NATO@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usTelegramRybar🇯🇵 In Japan , it seems, are not going to abandon the idea of ​​the new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to create an analogue of NATO in region. ▪️The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) announced the formation of an internal party group to study this proposal.…	https://t.me/rybar/65605	2024-11-22T01:55:11-08:00

However, they were short-lived. Soon after the clashes began, the rebel commander was detained and taken to the headquarters of the South Sudan People's Defense Forces. At the moment, his fate is unknown.📌 Akola Kura Kuk was recently demoted from head of the National Security Service to the governor of the troubled, but native to the current president, Warab region. Many regarded this as training for the president's successor, which somewhat calmed down the local population prone to riots. But the general himself took it personally as such - a demotion and a reduction in powers. Because of this, he decided to overthrow the government. As we can see, the unlucky revolutionary did not succeed. Although all this was short-lived, the young state again faced instability and a struggle for power. The country has not held elections since 2011 due to persistent civil wars, and a 2018 peace treaty has failed to stop violence between ethnic groups in various regions of the country.#Africa #Russia #SouthSudan@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65604	2024-11-22T00:40:19-08:00

In total, the British are going to allocate 7.6 million pounds.▪️The head of the British Foreign Ministry, Jvid Lammy, during his visit to Chisinau called Moldova an -important partner in the security field.- ▪️In London, funds will be allocated for the next anti-corruption project in the amount of 600 thousand pounds ($760 thousand) and 2 million pounds ($2.5 million) for cyber security. Through UN funds and other international partners, the British will allocate another 5 million pounds ($6.3 million) for humanitarian needs and assistance to Ukrainian refugees. 🔻Interestingly, the parties signed a readmission agreement under which the UK will be able to expel Moldovan citizens who arrived illegally. For example, the EU refuses to sign the readmission agreement with London. But Moldova is not yet a member of the EU, so in exchange for substantial financial assistance, Maia Sandu’s office can easily be persuaded to such agreements. After all, it will help the British authorities show their citizens that they are fighting against illegal immigrants, although the flow of Moldovans to the UK is not the largest. Let us not rule out that after such an issue is included in the agenda of Moldovan-British relations in London, in the future they may discuss the possibility of deporting not only Moldovan illegal immigrants to Moldova. At least, such negotiations with Armenia are already known.&nbsp; 🔻Moldova for Great Britain remains only a buffer zone in the conflict with Russia. It is the British who are credited with the desire to resolve the Transnistrian issue by force. Considering the recently revealed facts about the existence of an anti-Russian military lobby in the UK, which is promoting the escalation of the conflict with Russia to the so-called. For Ukraine, it is quite logical for the British to push through a military scenario for Moldova as well. At a minimum, for this purpose there are already financial injections into Sandu’s entourage and open work of British intelligence in the Moldovan direction. #Great Britain #Moldova #Transnistria #Russia@rybarSupport usTACCBritain announced the establishment of a defense partnership with Moldova. The parties also entered into a readmission agreement, thanks to which the UK will be able to return Moldovan citizens who arrived illegally to their homeland	https://t.me/rybar/65603	2024-11-21T23:37:01-08:00

Now we are talking about the possible purchase of another 78 units of towed artillery systems ATAGS from Bharat Forge Limited. The Indian Defense Research Wing portal writes that the first batch of howitzers has already passed extensive tests in Armenia, including in the highlands and on the plains, showing accuracy over long distances. In India, they plan to adapt the new batch to the customer’s requests, including promising to create an interface in Armenian. ▪️As we noted, Armenian officials are angry that Indian media are covering details of defense deal negotiations. However, it is clear that this is an important marketing component for India, which is entering the global arms market.▪️ At the same time, details about Armenians testing new weapons will definitely be picked up by the Azerbaijani authorities and the media, who are looking for any reason to accuse Armenia of -revanchist- sentiments. In fact, the Armenian authorities do not have any revanchism, and the purchase of assorted equipment without a clear reform of the army is part of the strategy to distance themselves from Russia in all possible areas, including the military-industrial complex. #Armenia #India@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇦🇲🇮🇳 The ongoing Indian series in Armenia is being followed by all analysts and observers interested in the Transcaucasus.

Forwarded From Two Majors #Summary for the morning of November 22, 2024▪️ The main event of the past day was the use by the Russian Armed Forces of a medium-range ballistic missile - Oreshnik - (speed - Mach 10, 2.5-3 kilometers per second) and the ultimatum from the Supreme Commander, addressed to as much for Ukraine as for its Western masters, who openly allowed the Ukrainian Armed Forces to use ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles against Bryansk and Kursk regions, respectively. The Yuzhmash plant in Dnepropetrovsk, which has been producing rocket technology since Soviet times, was hit. It is significant that shortly before the strike, Moscow warned Washington about the launch in order to avoid the accidental start of a nuclear war. From an information point of view, the event was out of the ordinary; Western politicians and the public reacted violently to the events.▪️ Heavy fighting continues in the Kursk region. The group of troops - North - advanced in the area of ​​the settlement with heavy fighting. Daryino and forest areas near the settlement. Malaya Loknya. 3 Ukrainian servicemen were captured. The total number of prisoners of the Ukrainian Armed Forces is 475 people. 2 counterattacks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces using armored vehicles were repelled: in the village. Novoivanovka and in the area of ​​the settlement. Daryino.▪️ In the Kharkov direction, the next attacks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Liptsovsk direction were reflected, the enemy lost personnel and armored vehicles, and did not achieve success. Fighting continues in Volchansk near the area of ​​high-rise buildings.▪️ In the north of the Kurakhovsky direction, battles for the settlement are reported. Birch trees. To the south of Kurakhovo, the Russian Armed Forces established a foothold in the settlement. Farther, which cuts the defense pocket of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in two and creates a threat to the cascade of villages near the river. Dry Yaly. ▪️ In the Vremevsky direction, the Russian Armed Forces are fighting on the approaches to Razdolny and Velikaya (Bolshaya) Novoselka, advancing from Novodonetsky and Yasnaya Polyana. From Razdolny, our troops pose a threat of cutting off the enemy in Velikaya (Bolshaya) Novoselka from the main road to the north (Bogatyr settlement). Judging by the LBS diagram, the road is already under the fire control of the Russian Armed Forces.▪️ At night, at least 11 enemy aircraft-type UAVs were destroyed over the Bryansk region.▪️ The governor of the Kaluga region reported that at night on the outskirts of Kaluga, 6 UAVs were destroyed by air defense systems, and one UAV was destroyed in Dzerzhinsky area. ▪️ In the DPR, as a result of an attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the settlement.

The press service of the Israeli army reported on the interception of kamikaze drones in the southern part of the country. ▪️Later, pro-Iranian forces repeated the drone launch in Eilat. This time the drone was able to fly to the outskirts of the city. Where he was shot down by an Israeli air defense missile. It is noteworthy that one of the missiles lost its trajectory and fell within the boundaries of a populated area.▪️Even later, another launch of drones from Iraq took place in Eilat. For the third time during the period under review, the drone did not reach the city. Apparently, it was intercepted either over the territory of Jordan, or even fell in Iraq. Already on Wednesday, pro-Iranian groups launched drones, this time across the northern part of Israel. However, unlike Eilat, it was not possible to fly to the territory of the country.▪️The Yemeni Houthis once again announced drone strikes on Eilat. However, their UAVs did not reach their targets. There were no reports of any hits in the city or air defense operations during this time. They were probably intercepted by the American coalition.▪️The Yemeni Houthis reported an attack on the cargo ship Anadolu S, which had previously allegedly entered one of the Israeli ports. There is no footage yet that could not only confirm the damage to the ship, but also the fact of the attack itself.▪️The Israeli Air Force once again struck the western outskirts of Damascus. The target, according to statements from Syrian opposition sources, was an apartment where Hezbollah representatives were located. ▪️Israeli troops once again carried out an airstrike on the border crossing between Lebanon and Syria. This, like previous similar strikes, is associated with attempts to interrupt the supply of weapons to Hezbollah from Syria by other pro-Iranian formations.#video #digest #map #Yemen #Syria #Iraq@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/65599	2024-11-21T21:01:58-08:00

They say there are no prohibitions, but if you continue, we will announce the exhaustion of supply options due to production reasons. And we repeat again: even in this case, the threat of long-range weapons strikes deep into Russia will not disappear anywhere, and attacks by drones and Ukrainian-made missiles ( with a large number of Western components) will continue.

At the same time, the fighters liberated Novoselidovka and the fields to the west of it: in the village itself, the movement of infantry of the Russian Armed Forces was recorded, and the fighting shifted to the south.▪️Near the northern shore of the Kurakhovsky reservoir, Russian units from the 5th Motorized Rifle Brigade liberated Novaya Ilyinka and started fighting for Berestki, moving along towards Starye Terny, from where the path to the exit opens to the rear of the Ukrainian positions in the center of Kurakhovo.▪️In Kurakhovo itself, Russian troops hoisted flags on the territory of the energy site of the Maryinskaya Distribution Zone near Zaporozhye Avenue directly in the city. 🔻According to unconfirmed information, fighting is already taking place in the area of ​​the Kurakhovsky elevator and bus station, located in the city center near the bridge to Novaya Ilyinka. To the southeast, attack aircraft are advancing along the Dolgaya ravine - some time ago, during the battle, an important stronghold was taken under control, which precedes the path to the southern outskirts of the city. To the south, Russian troops finally liberated Dalneye with the forces of soldiers of the 102nd regiment of the 150th motorized rifle division of the 8th OA. And during the raid of a Russian armored vehicle in the fields north of Ilyinka, it was possible to establish a more accurate configuration of the front at the Dalneye - Pobeda line.▪️ At the same time, on the southern flank from Bogoyavlenka, a successful attack was noted by the assault group of the 2nd battalion of the 39th Guards Motorized Rifle Brigade. The fighters expanded the zone of control and occupied part of the enemy positions in the grove - Lesnaya Dacha - south of Vesely Gai, the complete clearing of which will allow them to bypass the Ukrainian Armed Forces fortifications near Elizavetovka from the rear.▪️ At the same time, a few days earlier, Russian troops entered Trudovoye and hoisted a flag on the southern outskirts of the village . Currently, clashes continue in the locality. To the west, the control zone has been expanded in the fields near Maksimovka and along the O0510 highway, where Ukrainian formations are trying to carry out counterattacks and fire at the forward lines of defense of the Russian Armed Forces.

The attack was a response to US plans for the production of medium- and shorter-range missiles at the facility. The President also stated that in the event of an escalation, Russia will respond decisively and in a mirror manner, and targets for destruction will be selected depending on threats to the country’s security. It is characteristic that previously there was no information about Oreshnik in open sources, and even many specialized experts today about heard it for the first time. This means that the complex was developed without understatement in the strictest secrecy.❗️Vladimir Putin also directly stated that Russia has the right to use weapons against military facilities of those countries that give permission to use their long-range weapons to strike Russian territory. This wording is unambiguous, and the message to sponsors is the so-called. Ukraine is obvious.

🖼 🇸🇴The situation in the Horn of Africa: elections in Somalila...	🇸🇴The situation in the Horn of Africa: elections in Somaliland and discord in Jubalandes summary for October 22 - November 21, 2024 Last month in the Horn of Africa was marked by the formation of an anti-Ethiopian pact, which slightly constrained the Ethiopians in their ability to influence Somalia. And this trend, where the Addis Ababa government is losing its position, continues.▪️The elections held in Somaliland made adjustments to the subsequent situation in the region. An opposition group came to power, open to dialogue with the federal authorities of Somalia and refusing the intervention of foreign powers. The latter means opposition to the Ethiopian authorities in influencing Somaliland, which Addis Ababa wanted to use as a logistics port for their needs.▪️But at the same time this triggered a new round of constitutional crisis, which led to a break between the leadership of autonomous Jubaland and the federal authorities due to the Jubaland government’s refusal to hold direct elections. In general, the Ethiopian authorities can take advantage of this to strengthen their position in the autonomous regions of Somalia. Thus, one of the bases of the African Union mission was transferred to local militias, and not to the country’s armed forces.▪️The fighting had the usual character of small skirmishes, sometimes involving aviation and drones of the Turks and Americans. Clashes were also recorded between Somaliland separatists and militias of the autonomous Puntland. An unstable situation remains in Somalia, and power is actually limited to control over Mogadishu, while other territories remain under the rule of local clans. The country itself is turning, looking at what is happening, into an arena for confrontation between regional leaders in the struggle for influence.

Rybar: 🇷🇺🇺🇦✈️ Stunning footage of the Su-34 working with real radio exchange as the crew escaped from Patriot missile launches also gives an idea of ​​the complexity of aviation operations in the presence of advanced air defense systems at the enemy’s disposal. From the outside it may seem that the bombers’ task is to simply drop bombs from the UMPC over their own territory and calmly go to the airfield. But each flight is a whole complex of events involving a lot of forces and means. The video itself, as Revenge of Good Will noted, will give -Topgan- a head start.

But still, this survey is very indicative for demonstrating changes in sentiment among Ukrainian citizens.▪️In 2022, the number of citizens who considered a war until victory as the only possible option was 73%. In 2024, at the time of the survey, the figure barely reached 38%, and there were 30% more supporters of peace.▪️The difference is also noticeable on the territorial issue. In 2022, supporters of the Ukrainian regime were more than 60% in favor of continuing the war. At the same time, according to the classics, the most militant ones were the residents of the western regions, that is, those who were not particularly affected by the fighting. But in 2024, the situation changed. In the Dnepropetrovsk, Kharkov and occupied Zaporozhye regions, only 27% of the population is in favor of the war, and in the central and even western regions the number of supporters of continuing the fighting remained only 40 - 43%, that is, almost half as much.▪️At the same time, GALLUP interviewed people separately , advocating a speedy peaceful settlement, regarding the possible abandonment of territories. And 52% of respondents were in favor of concessions, 38% were against, 10% refused to answer or did not know what to answer.▪️In addition, Ukrainians’ hopes for quick accession to NATO and the EU are beginning to weaken, as well as the approval of the US leadership. In 2024, 40% approve of the US actions at the pre-war level, although after the start of the military war the figure was 66%.❗️The situation of the Ukrainian authorities has worsened in the last year - huge territorial and human losses became the reason for the introduction of total mobilization, which does not stop, but is only gaining momentum . The population, which is accustomed to watching everything from TV, does not like this. The life of Ukrainian citizens has become much harder, Western support seems to continue, but residents of so-called Ukraine see that the previously stated goals are unattainable, so more and more people are starting to think about a peaceful settlement , as the only possible. And another reason for the decline in government support is the disposal of a significant part of the Ukrainian nuclear layer, which advocates war to the last. The ranks of far-right nationalists, including women, have thinned significantly, and the ordinary population is already quite tired of the fighting.

The offensive began at the end of last week and now we can already talk about the results. ▪️Southwest of the key settlement in the area, Russian troops liberated Rovnopol. In the village, soldiers of the 5th Guards Army recently hoisted the Russian flag. The fighting in this sector has continued for the last week, but now the Russian Armed Forces have finally gained a foothold in Rovnopol. In Novodarovka, fighting continues in the center of the village. To the east in Makarovka, there remains a focal presence of scattered enemy detachments on the northern outskirts, but there is no talk of any successful counterattacks, much less control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces over the populated area.▪️From Yasnaya Polyana and Shakhterskoye, a very significant advance was noted towards Razdolnoye. Several forest belts, as well as strongholds, came under the control of Russian troops. In fact, now units of the 40th Infantry Brigade and the 5th Tank Brigade managed to reach the outskirts of Razdolnoye, and the 139th Infantry Brigade managed to bypass the settlement from the north from the side of the Nalivach and Shulicha gullies, almost reaching the T-05-18 highway. Some of the strongholds to the southeast were taken without any problems, and at some the Ukrainian formations are desperately resisting.▪️South of Razdolny, according to available data, in some areas it was possible to move up to five and a half kilometers to the west south of the Maltabar gully. The Russian Armed Forces were able to reach almost the outskirts of Bolshaya Novoselka, advancing along the O0510 road. It is between the Kashlagach River and the highway that the greatest advance of Russian troops is recorded. In the interval between the Kashlagach and Shaitanka rivers, the enemy was also knocked out of several forest belts. South of Shaitanka, west of Novodonetskoye, there are also noticeable successes, where units of the 37th Motorized Rifle Brigade are advancing: the advance was about five kilometers in the direction of Blagodatnoye.

🇫🇷🌾 In France, protests by farmers against the EU agreement co...	🇫🇷🌾 In France, protests by farmers against the EU agreement with the MERCOSUR countries on the removal of customs duties on their agricultural products continue for the fifth day. The protests began on Sunday at the call of the main agricultural trade union FNSEA.🔻Protests related to the discussion of a free trade agreement between the EU and MERCOSUR are timed to coincide with Macron’s visit to Argentina and the G20 summit in Brazil, but have every chance of continuing after events. On Sunday, in unison with their German colleagues, French business executives blocked the border in Strasbourg - the Kehl Bridge. Ports in Le Havre, Rouen and Bordeaux are also blocked. A march of farmers to Brussels is planned for Monday. 🔻The protesters represent different interests: ▪️The main trade union of farmers, FNSEA, represents large farmers and the agro-industrial complex, who do not need competition in the form of cheaper, more massive products from Latin America and stuffed with pesticides banned in the EU. Of the 178 pesticides used in Brazil, 138 are banned in France, the French Corn Society proved in March. However, it is the difference in phytosanitary standards that makes these products much cheaper, and everyone understands that, due to inflation, the French will buy them. ▪️The more conservative and radical trade union Coordination Rurale, well represented in southwestern France, including near the city of Agen, represents small and medium-sized livestock farms that are already losing money due to the import of Ukrainian agricultural products into the EU, including chicken meat. Any duty-free quotas from Latin America - and now we are talking about 98,000 tons of beef, 25,000 tons of pork and 160,000 tons of chicken - would be a death sentence. In recent days, farmers have marched on tractors in the regional centers of southwestern France: Oche, Perigueux, Limoges, Bordeaux, Pau, Nimes, Rodez, Guere, and also reminded of themselves in the middle cities of Brittany, and the cities of the northeast of the country. In rural areas, farmers disable road cameras - however, since 2013, they have suffered at every mass protest. And in the suburb of Bordeaux - Pessac - brave suppliers of agricultural products break into councils, confiscate EU flags and burn them.❗️So far, it seems, there is a simple warm-up with symbolic actions, but they are overlaid with general dissatisfaction with the policies pursued to please the world transnational elites, the plight of farmers and winemakers after a rainy summer and political instability in France after parliamentary early elections at the end of June.🔻The French themselves do not support the protests of the farmers, but they do not interfere either. According to polls, 81% of the local population supports the rallies, and 75% are opposed to signing an agreement with MERCOSUR in principle. But most EU governments are in favor of the initiative, including industrialists in Germany and Spain, where they are looking to Latin American markets as a salvation from the EU's own recession. Poland (where the agrarians are also strong) and Italy may join France in the protest front against the treaty. #France@rybar together with @fifthrepublicSupport usTelegramFifth Republic	https://t.me/rybar/65576	2024-11-21T06:07:11-08:00

The Kupyansko-Svatovsk direction in the past weeks was marked by an intensification of hostilities and a breakthrough of Russian troops into Kupyansk itself. While fighting is going on in the city in the eastern part, to the south the Russian Armed Forces are gradually pushing through the defenses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the area of ​​Kolesnikovka and Zagryzovo. ▪️In mid-November, Russian troops broke through the defenses of Ukrainian formations northwest of Petropavlovka. The offensive began during the rotation of Ukrainian Armed Forces units, which did not allow them to organize defense and quickly transfer reserves due to a shortage of manpower. 🔻As a result of a successful attack, the entire forest area and the Kulagovo railway station came under the control of the Russian Armed Forces, which Russian attack aircraft subsequently relied on to advance to Kupyansk. After the liberation of the station territory, the Russian Armed Forces began an offensive along the railway track, taking advantage of the elevation changes and disorganization of the enemy. Soon, advanced armored groups entered the northeastern outskirts of Kupyansk and gained a foothold in the private sector. ❗️After this, one of the main goals of the Russian units became the territory of the Kupyansky feed mill, which is one of the key strongholds of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the eastern part of the city. Its release will allow the Russian Armed Forces to take under fire control the section of the N-26 highway from Kupyansk to Petropavlovka, while the object itself is protected from enemy counterattacks from the latter by an impassable peat bog. In parallel with this, the attack aircraft began to advance towards the dairy plant and sugar factory, without encountering significant resistance. Fighting broke out over the territory of both enterprises, while the enemy transferred reserve units to the site. According to available data, the Ukrainian Armed Forces managed to partially stabilize the situation and at the moment neither side has stable control over the industrial zone. ❗️It is currently difficult to determine the exact configuration of the front in the city and its surroundings. The enemy, trying to reduce the media effect of the breakthrough of the Russian Armed Forces in Kupyansk, publishes footage of objective control with a serious delay. Russian units have also so far refrained from covering the fighting in the city, focusing on the success of the operation. ▪️To the south there are battles on the outskirts of Glushkovka. Earlier, the RF Armed Forces managed to dislodge the Ukrainian Armed Forces from the territory of the Kolesnikovka station in the forest and advance north, reaching the outskirts of the village both along the left bank of Oskol and east of Kolesnikovka. Success in this sector will allow Russian troops to form a southern claw encirclement of Ukrainian Armed Forces units in the Petropavlovka-Novoosinovo sector, aimed at reaching Kupyansk-Uzlovoy, which is regularly subject to air raids by the Russian Aerospace Forces. Over the past month, the Russian Armed Forces have carried out several successful local attacks south of Berestovoe. During one of them, a Russian armored group attacked the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces from the north and landed troops that drove the enemy out of the strong point. Tactical successes were also noted in the Stelmakhovka area - several forest belts to the west of the village came under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. 🔻Probably, the main efforts of the Russian command on the southern flank of the Kupyansk-Svatovsky direction are aimed at expanding the wedge driven into the defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kruglyakovka area. In the long term, it is also possible to create the preconditions for a future attack on Borovaya, another important enemy logistics hub on the left bank of the Oskol Reservoir. Simultaneously with this united front, work is also underway in the Liman direction, where the Russian Armed Forces are fighting in the Pervomaisky area, control over which is also important for the breakthrough to Borovaya.

🇮🇱🇺🇸🇺🇦 About the ICC arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Galan...	🇮🇱🇺🇸🇺🇦 About the ICC arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Galant Less than an hour ago, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for the Prime Minister and former Minister of Defense of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Galant, for war crimes committed in the Gaza Strip.🔻Since the information is confirmed by Israeli media, it can be stated that the ultra-Orthodox government of Israel with acceleration drove into the wall. In fact, this is a continuation of the confrontation, the next episode of which was the investigation against ICC Prosecutor General Karim Khan, probably initiated by supporters of the current Israeli leadership. Of course, no one will arrest Netanyahu and Galant (as well as our President Vladimir Putin). This is rather a slap in the face and a serious diplomatic blow to the reputation of the ultra-Orthodox.📌 But the ultra-Orthodox themselves and also their supporters (for example, like Chabadniks, many of whom are first-rank officials in the so-called Ukraine) will have cause for great concern. After all, for them this does not mean anything good, at least in the short term. Everything that happened is similar to the demobilization chord of those who stand behind Biden. In recent weeks, the US authorities have been doing everything that will undoubtedly affect Donald Trump after his inauguration. Granting permission to Ukrainian formations, new packages of military assistance - this was done to complicate the resolution of the conflict. Donald Trump himself has close family ties with the ultra-Orthodox, and the order against Netanyahu and Galant will also affect Trump. And this, in turn, will have an impact on the Ukrainian elite, which will be more difficult for Trump to support.❗️In the short term, the ultra-Orthodox in Israel will begin to try on the image of victims of anti-Semitism, simultaneously mobilizing everyone they can, supposedly to resist hostile pressure from the outside. That is, continue to pursue an aggressive policy against its neighbors.#Israel #USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport uswww.news1.co.ilבית הדין הפלילי בהאג הוציא צווי מעצר Please contact us, * Please: Please contact us חיילים	https://t.me/rybar/65574	2024-11-21T04:58:17-08:00

The main feature of the video was that militants began using drones to attack government forces, and the narrator particularly noted the influence of Ukrainian forces on new combat tactics using drones. According to a member of the KTD (Uzbek, judging by the language), drones have become an effective tool that is much cheaper than missiles or other weapons , but they can strike at concentrations of people, equipment and firing points, as they showed in the published footage.🔻The news that immediately comes to mind is that units of the Ukrainian The GUR trained militants in Idlib to assemble, modernize and use drones against the Russian Armed Forces and the Syrian Arab Republic. Before the appearance of this information, terrorists were not observed in the methodical use of these technologies. There were isolated episodes, but not so often. The Uzbek terrorist KTD did not directly say who trained them, but the facts in the form of hints about the success of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in this direction speak for themselves. All this once again demonstrates the influence of the special operation on the course of armed conflicts. Interest in unmanned technologies has increased due to the low cost of materials and high possibilities for their use, which is expressed not only in Syria, but also in other regions such as Africa or Myanmar.#Russia #Syria #terrorism #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65569	2024-11-21T04:39:01-08:00
🖼 🌍🇪🇸 About migrant flows to the Canaries Exacerbation of the...	🌍🇪🇸 About migrant flows to the Canary Islands The aggravation of the internal political situation in northeast Africa has caused significant changes in the routes of migration flows. In the past few years, African refugees have chosen routes not through Libya, but through the Comoros Islands, which belong to Spain. Numerous migrants from Gambia, Senegal, Mauritania and other West African countries use the services of smugglers to cross the sea. The relative cheapness and geographical accessibility attract Africans who have little to lose. Moreover, various Western NGOs calmly distribute money, which is just enough to transport them to Europe.❗However, this route is the most dangerous. According to Western analysts, approximately 95% of all fatal migration flights occur in the Atlantic. At the same time, the number of migrants does not decrease, but rather increases. So, since 2023, the number of arrivals to the Canary Islands has increased by more than 1000%.🔻This issue raises concerns in the EU. The Spanish authorities clearly do not want to see tens of thousands of illegal migrants on their territory, especially in the tourist area, which could create security problems and affect the tourist flows that bring in a lot of money. Therefore, more than 200 million euros were allocated from Europe to Mauritania to fight illegal immigrants. And the Spanish fleet participates in joint patrols with their Senegalese and Mauritanian counterparts. And, of course, this does not bring any results while there are millions of Africans living in poverty and dreaming of moving to Europe. And the financing of social programs by various NGOs only encourages people to spend the money they receive on a -new life-.High resolution mapEnglish version#Africa #migration@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65568	2024-11-21T03:40:08-08:00

The most important was the strike on the YuzhMash industrial enterprise in Dnepropetrovsk, during which an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) could have been used. According to some signs, an ICBM could actually be used for this (this can be seen from the characteristic multiple warheads), which is the first successful combat use of this type of weapon in the history of military conflicts. The combat units were non-nuclear. Although there is talk on the Internet about the RS-26 Rubezh, the type of missile is not reliably known. Ukrainian formations were unable to shoot down the ICBMs, as evidenced by the arrival footage.❗️This can be called a clear signal to the sponsors of so-called Ukraine (especially on the anniversary of the Maidan) against the backdrop of Western permission to use long-range missiles. Time will tell how much they understood it. But today’s strike is truly a non-trivial move, since nothing like this has happened before. And there is reason to believe that this is not the last such application.#Dnepropetrovsk #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65566	2024-11-21T02:54:55-08:00

According to them, they were given an ultimatum: to surrender their powers or establish contacts with the authorities of the Islamic Emirate. Recently, many of this kind of pressure on the ambassadors of the now defunct republic has intensified. Many countries began to demand similar actions from them. In July, the Taliban announced that they no longer recognize the diplomatic missions created by the former government of Afghanistan and the passports, visas and other documents they issued. It is logical that it was in Germany that they took drastic measures: the Germans are trying to resolve the issue of deportation of Afghan refugees. This issue was already discussed during the chancellor's visit to Central Asia two months ago. And taking into account how the migration situation in Europe and Germany, in particular, has worsened, the new trends are quite understandable. The funny paradox is that people who fled the war with the Taliban indirectly and without their desire help the new Afghan authorities resolve the issue of their legitimization at the international level arena. And the Germans, quite possibly, will give impetus to other European states to do the same. But, looking at these actions of Germany, theses about the growing danger of the Islamic State in Afghanistan look even more artificial. In Europe, the Taliban are accused of allegedly not coping with the Islamic State, but at the same time they themselves are taking steps towards recognition of the Islamic Emirate as the legitimate government in the country. #Afghanistan #Germany@rybarSupport usfergana.mediaGerman authorities forced the Ambassador of Afghanistan and the Consul General in Bonn to leave resign	https://t.me/rybar/65564	2024-11-21T01:37:01-08:00

They are planning this because of difficulties crossing the Kazakh-Kyrgyz border, which arise with enviable regularity. In fact, in Astana, they use their geographic location in this way to fight competitors in favor of their carriers, which causes damage to other sectors of the Kyrgyz (and not only) economy. This is not the first time this corridor project has been talked about. Last summer, Governor Igor Babushkin announced the participation of Astrakhan shipping companies in it. Later, in November 2023, a memorandum of understanding was signed at the first SCO transport forum in Tashkent. For the Kyrgyz economy, as well as for the Russian one, the presence of alternative routes (and multimodal) is important, since there must be diversification in any area.

The Moroccan armed forces are purchasing the Akinci drone, which has already proven itself on the Dark Continent, and the Turkish Armed Forces themselves are actively using them against the Kurds in Iraq. For Morocco, this is not the first Turkish drone - they have already used the Bayraktar TB2 in operations against Western Saharawi rebels. Not to say that it is very effective, since sometimes their attacks led to the death of civilians and gold miners in Mauritania. In addition, Turkish companies are interested in exporting their training aircraft to Egypt. The Hürjet presented by TAI is a cheaper analogue of Western products for air force modernization, and according to plans it can be used as a light attack aircraft. But here, too, the nuance is that these are promising aircraft that have not even been put into production yet, and their real capabilities are unknown. So far, only two prototypes have been built, which should replace the American training T-38. In general, the fact that Ankara is trying to sell its products to unstable markets is a long-established trend. And they have success. Due to their low cost and the lack of dense air defense in the countries of the region, these drones are a formidable weapon against rebels and militants.#Africa #UAVs #Egypt #Morocco #Turkey@rybarSupport usMilitary AfricaMorocco acquiring Akinci drone from TurkeyMorocco is reportedly in talks to acquire Turkish Bayraktar Akinci drones.

Ukraine. As it turned out, almost immediately after the start of the SVO, Project Alchemy was assembled under the auspices of the British Ministry of Defense. 🔻In addition to military personnel, it included intelligence workers, analysts, specialists in the field of honey, industrialists, scientific experts and other persons united by the goal of achieving an increase in the escalation of the current conflict. Their tasks included organizing cyberattacks, sabotage, even terrorist attacks on Russian territory, as well as drawing up a plan to change power in the country. They were also involved in developing a strategy for conducting combat operations and drawing the maximum number of NATO countries into the conflict. As part of the project, the sabotage of negotiations in Istanbul in the spring of 2022 was carried out. Some of the recommendations of Alchemy have already been implemented, including a strike on the Kerch Bridge and the creation of cells for murder, sabotage and terrorist attacks in the Russian rear. At the recent NATO summit, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer voiced the ideas developed within the project, and the British crown officially promised to support the so-called. Ukraine -as long as it takes -.📌 Another heap of official documents again proves the facts of subversive activities and deliberate escalation, but Great Britain is only a tool here. In fact, the plan is much broader and includes further stressing the population, discrediting national governments.

According to the PRC, the delivery was agreed with the Chinese authorities. If earlier the Chinese coast guard gave a tough response to such actions, then recently there has been no reaction to the delivery of goods. It's all about the bilateral agreement concluded in July 2024, which made it possible to resolve this issue at least temporarily. When the document was first signed, some observers argued that it would not be respected due to conflicting provisions. However, four months have already passed since the end of July, and the Filipinos have already delivered cargo three times without resistance from the Chinese side. 📌 And yet this does not mean that relations between China and the Philippines have normalized. Manila recently passed a law delineating the country's exclusive economic zone, parts of which are disputed in Beijing. China responded by releasing a map of the territorial waters of one disputed island and increasing patrols near it. At the same time, there have been no serious clashes in the waters between the Chinese and Filipinos for some time. However, after the determination of a new US foreign policy course, the time may come to review the existing agreements between the Philippines and China. Therefore, if it is beneficial for both sides to sabotage the situation, they will definitely take advantage of this opportunity, which could lead to further incidents of varying degrees of severity. #China #Philippines@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usAP NewsChinese and Philippine forces again avoid a clash in a fiercely disputed shoal under a rare dealThe Philippine navy has transported food and other supplies to a territorial ship outpost in a shoal in the South China Sea without any confrontation with Chinese forces guarding the area.	https://t.me/rybar/65549	2024-11-20T08:32:06-08:00

The German publication Der Spiegel published another sensation about the bombing of the Nord Streams: according to journalists, it was allegedly carried out by 12 citizens of the so-called. Ukraine under the leadership of Roman Chervinsky, who previously trained at the CIA. ▪️The article says that the bomb was prepared by a retired demolition expert, and the training took place in a lake and a flooded mine on Ukrainian territory. Later, the group with fake Romanian and Bulgarian passports arrived in Poland, where they rented a yacht.▪️In the process, saboteurs from among IT administrators and air conditioning specialists encountered many problems, including seasickness. As a result, they were able to plant six bombs on the branches of the gas pipeline, but one did not work, and Pipe-B of Nord Stream 2 remained untouched.▪️Der Spiegel also claims that the operation was approved by the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Zaluzhny, and Zelensky allegedly said nothing about it knew. Later, Western curators gave an order to cancel it, but the executors simply disobeyed it. They also planned to disable the Turkish Stream, but the attack failed.📌 Let's imagine for a second that everything stated is actually true. The following picture emerges: a certain group of Ukrainian amateurs prepares to undermine international infrastructure off the coast of NATO countries in secret from the leadership, ignores the direct order of its sponsors, cuts off Germany from cheap energy resources and provokes an economic recession there. Be that as it may, with such articles, the overseas beneficiaries of sabotage kill two birds with one stone - they lay the blame on the so-called. n.

According to him, citizens of the so-called. Ukraine is doing this in order to receive payments due to residents of areas with radiation contamination. This now costs the Ukrainian authorities 15 billion hryvnia annually, so in Kyiv they are trying to reduce this expense item. In particular, in the budget for 2025, these payments will be given only to those who lived in the exclusion zone from 1986 to 1993. However, the real reason for such increased interest of the local population in the vicinity of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is not only the desire to enrich themselves through benefits. Indeed, in this area with minimally developed social infrastructure, it is very easy to get lost from the supervision of the authorities. This is especially true for mobilization: TCC workers do not go there often, so in the exclusion zone you can quite successfully hide from conscription. Moreover, the level of radiation contamination in most of it is not much different from the standard, and it is quite safe to be there.

In this case, what is most noteworthy is that the Ukrainian Armed Forces continue to launch Western long-range missiles in salvos at single targets to increase the likelihood of their destruction. That is, there is apparently no talk of accumulating reserves for the next media offensive. 📌 At the same time, the number of both ATACMS and Storm Shadow/SCALP among Ukrainian formations is quite limited. And it’s not just a matter of supply volumes—first of all, we’re talking about the current production capabilities of Western manufacturing plants. However, hoping that the Ukrainian Armed Forces will simply run out of all these missiles and the threat will go away on its own is also reckless. With a high probability, the West will supply components for the expansion of production of Neptunes and other long-range missiles in the so-called territory. Ukraine. So, in any case, it will not be possible to sit out in a passive defense, and this issue can only be resolved by military measures, which are extremely clear to the sponsors of the Kyiv regime.#Great Britain #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramTwo majors❗️Kursk region, use of Storm Shadow by the enemy We are informed that from 14:50 the enemy fired up to 12 Storm Shadow missiles into the region, fragments of which are shown in the photo in the village.

Forwarded From Andrey Medvedev Ukrainian propagandists made a poster that, in their opinion, should symbolize the will to victory of citizens of the former Ukraine and fighters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It is characteristic that the central figure on the poster is traditionally a woman. In this case, Ukraine. Moreover, not just a Ukrainian woman, but in the form of a pagan priestess or a pagan goddess. And no, this is not an angel, despite the presence of wings. Angels are sexless and incorporeal. Just the other day we discussed with colleagues what role women play in shaping the ideology of war in the territory of the former Ukraine. And on this poster, a normal person sees a priestess of a pagan cult leading a crowd of zombies. The cult of the Great Mother or the goddess of war in a modern version. The authors of the idea certainly understood why it was necessary to make just such a poster. This reflects the strange ideological reality in which the population of Ukraine lives.	https://t.me/rybar/65545	2024-11-20T04:53:03-08:00
🇬🇧 Yesterday a large protest by farmers took place in London, i...	🇬🇧 Yesterday, a large farmers’ protest took place in London, in which about 20 thousand people took part. The demonstration was originally due to take place in Trafalgar Square, but organizers had to move the event to Whitehall Street and Parliament Square to accommodate everyone. Such a strong public reaction was caused by the decision of Chancellor Rachel Reeves to introduce a 20% inheritance tax on agricultural land worth more than 1 million pounds. Critics warn the new levy will destroy family farms, which make up around 60 percent of Britain's agricultural base. Labor Party member John McTernan added fuel to the fire by declaring that -the country does not need small farms.- In turn, Reeves described her tax changes as -fair and proportionate- and insisted that they would affect only 25 percent of farms. It is unlikely that the UK government did not understand what the consequences of tax increases could be for the agricultural sector. Therefore, the decision taken is a targeted blow to the industry and may in the future lead to an increase in food prices. But ultimately, such actions are aimed at stressing one’s own population in order to make it more pliable. #UK@rybarSupport usThe Independent'It's become so tough I'm looking for a second job': Inside the farming crisisAs figures show a decline in smaller farms, farmers tell Alex Ross that Rachel Reeves' Budget 'tractor tax' is the latest blow to a family industry struggling to survive amid rising costs and extreme weather	https://t.me/rybar/65544	2024-11-20T04:23:16-08:00

Previously, a UAV of this type practiced takeoff from a ground-based ski jump simulating a deck. The video demonstrates the fundamental possibility of using Bayraktarov and similar drones on aircraft-carrying ships. They cannot completely replace carrier-based jet aircraft, but they are quite capable of completing a significant part of the tasks. This is especially true for states whose navies cannot support full-fledged aircraft carriers, but have cheaper UDCs. As a result, countries like Egypt, Indonesia, Japan or Spain will be able to significantly expand the strike and reconnaissance capabilities of their fleets. At the same time, this is further evidence that once again - burying - large ships with the advent of BeKov is very reckless and short-sighted. And also another clear illustration of the importance of aircraft-carrying ships, contrary to some populist slogans.#UAV #Turkey #fleet@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65542	2024-11-20T03:04:06-08:00

Liquid explosives were found in his car. It is clear that he is a Ukrainian who received German citizenship. But what passport did he use to cross the border? A German citizen was detained who was involved in one act of sabotage and was planning another on Russian territory. Who will be charged besides the detainee? The German government, whose citizens commit bombings in Russia, and their country is home to SBU curators with a residence permit in Hamburg.

After the elections, President Maia Sandu and the leaders of the ruling PAS party admitted -mistakes- in the work of the government and promised to take into account -the opinion of citizens- in the formation of a new cabinet of ministers. However, in this matter, Sandu’s team did not keep their promises, since no real changes occurred. ▪️The head of the Ministry of Agriculture, Vladimir Bol, was transferred to head the Ministry of Infrastructure and Regional Development. Boley is associated with the agricultural crisis in Moldova: he is also credited with protecting large agricultural holdings offshore to the detriment of national interests and local producers. ▪️Bolya took the place of Andrei Spinu, who is called one of the main corrupt officials of the Sandu era and one of the most influential people in her team. He himself recently announced his resignation, but this is seen as a political move by PAS to temporarily remove the main irritant for society. ▪️The only new face in the government was the Minister of Agriculture Lyudmila Katlabuga. At the same time, she admitted that she does not yet have a program of action, although she was entrusted with the most critical area. ▪️The head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Adrian Efros, resigned, and his position will be taken by the ministry’s Secretary of State Daniela Misail-Nikitina, who does not even have a specialized legal education. As a result, the government limited itself to only three minor changes, although mass resignations were predicted. Even the Minister of Justice, Veronica Mihailova-Moraru, remained in office, although Sandu herself recently announced the complete failure of reform in this area. Once again, Sandu and PAS are not keeping their promises, since there will clearly not be any fundamental changes in the work of the already ineffective government. This is also due to the fact that Sandu’s team does not tolerate dissent and people of other views, which is why the choice of managers is limited in advance.#Moldova @rybarSupport usInterfaxThere will be personnel changes in the Cabinet of Ministers of Moldova.

However, his visit gained popularity for completely different reasons. While on the beach, the head of the Israeli government addressed the Palestinian population with the following proposal - he promised to pay $5 million for each freed Israeli hostage held captive by Hamas. He guaranteed those who responded to the call free departure from the enclave along with their families. 🔻It is noteworthy that Benjamin Netanyahu made a similar proposal 13 months after the escalation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This is not something new - previously everything was limited to SMS messages and leaflets, which offered to transfer information about the places of detention of captive Israelis for a fee. However, even if the IDF manages to obtain informants in this way, it will not be so easy to save the hostages. Especially considering that often such operations not only did not produce results, but also led to the death of Israelis in captivity. Among Hamas members there are even fewer willing to agree to such a proposal, and this is not only due to fears of being exposed. Agreeing to the Israeli proposal does not guarantee protection: at best, such militants will end up in an Israeli prison, at worst, they will simply be taken by the IDF to an unknown destination after completing their mission. 📌 Such statements are much more aimed at the Israeli audience, especially those participating in anti-government protests demanding a deal with Hamas. This allows Israel's ruling authorities to claim that they did everything possible for a peaceful outcome, but the Palestinians left them no choice.#Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65539	2024-11-20T00:21:11-08:00

🔁 ATACMS and media sovereignty In 78 days of autumn, Russian air...	Forwarded From NechaevATACMS and media sovereignty During 78 days of autumn, Russian air defense intercepted 79 ATACMS missiles. Until November 17, few people were interested in this, since analyzing statistics from the Ministry of Defense reports had become a routine even for employees of specialized media, let alone ordinary people. But on November 17, everyone became alarmed. Why suddenly? Oh, yes: The New York Times reported Biden's decision to approve long-range strikes deep into Russia. In the language of NATO countries, this is called -allowing Ukraine to use long-range missiles on Russian territory.- The phrase requires translation: • Allow Ukraine = try to shift responsibility to a proxy, in order to then repeat the sacred phrase that the United States and NATO are not parties to the conflict; • Apply = pretend that the -red button- is being pressed by proxies that have their own reconnaissance and target designation system. In reality, this is done by the American satellite constellation, data processing and transmission centers in the USA, Britain and France, as well as specialists loading flight missions into rockets (details here); • On the territory of Russia = on the territory of Russia within the borders of 1991-2013, of course, because missiles are flying across Crimea, eastern Novorossiya and Donbass without Biden’s sanction, since in their picture of the world it is Ukraine. Further, this phrase is picked up not only by Reuters, Le Figaro and other El Pais, but also by almost all Russian federal media, including state ones. And everything is presented as if there are no new regions, as if the air defense does not shoot down ATACMS missiles month after month, as if the Supreme Commander in June and September did not explain the operating principle of such systems and did not voice Russia’s possible responses to the obvious expansion of the conflict zone. Further - worse. After lunch on November 19, one of the most quoted Russian agencies releases news with the headline -The Ukrainian Armed Forces launched the first strike with an American ATACMS missile on Russian territory-. First? No, colleagues. Not even 101st. A few hours later, apparently, one of the agency employees came to his senses, remembered the referendums of 2014 and 2022, the changes in the Russian Constitution, the successes of air defense - and changed the headline: -The Ukrainian Armed Forces launched the first ATACMS strike deep into Russian territory-. Also a controversial formulation, but oh well. Let's note a more important thing. The ATACMS story exposed the lack of media sovereignty in Russia. What does this lead to in practice? On the one hand, to the psychosis of the masses and the formation of a distorted picture of the world among millions of readers. This can be seen in media traffic, comments on social networks and query statistics in search engines. People ride on emotional swings. And on the other hand, it leads to the creation of an erroneous illusion for the enemy: -Judging by their reactions, if you press a little more, then maybe they will flinch?!-. They won’t flinch, of course. But the perception of the limits of what is permissible will be adjusted not in our favor and will require much greater resources to restore parity and balance of power. What to do? To begin with, it is worth realizing that sovereignty is not only political, economic, military, technological, cultural - but also media, because this is the 21st century and multi-domain operations are only gaining momentum. Therefore, you should not help the enemy in information and cognitive wars. And most importantly, sovereignty begins not with an official in the Kremlin, the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the FSB, but with your loved one, your way of thinking, self-discipline and responsibility. Otherwise, a strange situation arises: the military shoots down ATACMS in commercial quantities, and the media (not all) do not even try to repel someone else’s media missile and launch a counterattack. And it should be!	https://t.me/rybar/65529	2024-11-19T13:25:02-08:00

The goal of the operation is to unblock those encircled in the Signal Corps, which have been holding it since April 2023. To do this, the Sudanese army will have to break through either through industrial zones or through densely populated Shambat and Samrab.▪️Also a significant event was the cutting off of the Sennar salient, as a result of which it will become more difficult for the RRF to supply its group in the Blue Nile and Sinj. During the fighting, government troops took the large city of Dinder. The rebels did not sit on the defensive and during the counterattack they occupied the village of Tambol, carrying out a massacre in it: ▪️There were reports of the successes of the RSF in the Ed-Dueim area and their capture of several villages north of the city, and in El-Fasher, neither side cannot achieve success. At the same time, recently there have been more and more incidents related to violence against the civilian population by the rebels. Despite the successes of government forces, they still find it difficult to regain territory. And the lack of dialogue between the parties due to the fact that all peace initiatives are taking place under the patronage of the United States only prolongs the conflict. Against this background, contacts between representatives of the Sudanese authorities and Russia look curious: Energy Minister Mohiddin Al-Naim Said said that Russian companies are invited to work at oil production facilities in safe Sudanese areas. He also agreed on the supply of turbines to the Power Machines company for the hydroelectric power station in Merowe. In fact, even a war-torn side can provide projects attractive to domestic investors. This also means that prospects for post-war cooperation in civilian areas are already being laid.

🔁🖼 🇩🇪⚡️Germany is seriously preparing for war with Russia The...	Forwarded From Two Majors🇩🇪⚡️Germany is seriously preparing for war with Russia. The Bundeswehr has intensified the implementation of the Operation Plan -Germany-. The secret strategic document includes the procedure for preparing the country in case of war with Russia, writes Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitun. For these purposes, military department officers provide consultations and training to enterprise management during wartime. In particular, at the events of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry, recommendations were made to train at least five additional truck drivers for every hundred employees. This measure is due to the German military’s concerns about the unreliability of 70% of German drivers who come from Eastern European countries. In relation to such workers, it is recommended to draw up a plan outlining what to expect and how to handle such employees. In addition, it is recommended to engage in self-sufficiency in backup sources of electricity, through the purchase of diesel generators or wind power plants. The document also lists all structures and infrastructure that are especially worthy protection for military reasons. Earlier, in September 2024, Bundeswehr Colonel Kronstadt from the headquarters of the NATO Joint Support and Enforcement Command (JSEC) announced work to create a permanent march corridor through Europe to the borders of Russia and Belarus. ✨Whatever figure comes after Scholz’s puppet, the policy of confrontation (hidden or open) will continue in the German state.

AUG Charles de Gaulle by the end of this year will first go to the Eastern Mediterranean to participate in joint NATO events, and then to the Red Sea. There they will probably show their presence to the Houthis and move on.▪️The French are planning their main maneuvers in the Indian and Pacific oceans. South of the coast of India, the French will conduct a joint exercise with the Indians - Varuna -, which is annual. ▪️ After this, the aircraft carrier will sail to the coasts of Australia and Indonesia, where a multinational exercise led by France - La Perouse 2025 - is planned, in which 10 countries, including the United States, will take part , Britain and the countries of the region.▪️The final exercise for the French AUG is considered to be the Pacific Steller exercise together with the USA, Canada, Australia and Japan, which will take place east of the Philippines. However, adjustments to plans are possible. The French, following their European partners, are increasing their presence in the Asia-Pacific region, reaffirming NATO’s shift of emphasis to the East towards China. The Chinese leadership, by the way, has already expressed its dissatisfaction with the plans of Britain and France, calling them provocative.

More than 70 experts, government officials and international representatives took part in an active dialogue, dedicated to terrorism, human trafficking, migrant smuggling and other pressing security issues. EU Ambassador Alyoshka Simkic, appointed in early October, assessed the event as an important step forward in security relations between the EU and Kazakhstan. However, for the collective West, discussing such problems is a way to consolidate their influence in the region, where Kazakhstan serves as a convenient platform for them. For example, inflating the threat from ephemeral groups such as the Islamic State - Vilayat Khorasan - is one of the main trends of the past year. We especially note Simkic herself: she served as deputy chief observer of the OSCE special monitoring mission in the so-called Ukraine.

🔁 We waited and it was published. What can we say about our new ...	Forwarded From Watfor | Freeway think tank (Dmitry Stef)We waited and it was published. What can we say about our new -nuclear fundamentals-? Let's formulate it in three words: continuity, allies, threshold. Let's decipher: many provisions repeat the content of a similar document from 2020 (which we examined here), we now provide nuclear protection to our allies more specifically (paragraphs 18, 19d), and we nuclearly restrain others more strictly (paragraphs 10, 11) , the nuclear threshold has been lowered and raised more than once in our recent history. As expected, now we have a threat to the very existence of the state, in fact, replaced by a threat to sovereignty and territorial integrity. In fact, other formulations voiced at the end of September were reflected in the document. Interesting things have also been added, for example, regarding attacks on our facilities and troops outside the national territory (clause 18b), as well as actions aimed at isolating some of our lands and blocking transport communications (clause 15g) and possible attacks on , for example, our nuclear power plants (clause 15z). By and large, this was understandable as it was, but it is useful to have a document. Let us note that despite all the fuss about our possible intentions to deploy nuclear weapons in space, according to the Fundamentals, our nuclear deterrent force is so far exclusively ground-based, sea-based and air-based ( paragraph 17). As before, it is emphasized that nuclear weapons are a means of deterrence, and in order to reduce the nuclear threat, any military conflicts, not just nuclear ones, must be prevented (paragraph 5). The author’s favorite point about the continuity of nuclear deterrence, but only until the use of nuclear weapons, has also been preserved (paragraph 14). Accordingly, without any restoration of deterrence through use, we will find ourselves in some new world. In a very uncomfortable world. Let us also note the preservation of the somewhat crooked formulation about ballistic missiles (clause 19a). Apparently, we are talking about SLBMs, ICBMs and, possibly, IRBMs, but, of course, now everyone is running in circles around the ATACMS- dispenser. Let us emphasize once again - in any case, there is no automatism in the entire section III and there cannot be. These are the conditions, and the decision will be made by the President (clause 20) based on the completeness of the data processed by decision support systems. Well, then he will, perhaps, inform his counterparties in other countries and international organizations (clause 21). What is the reason for all these changes? Everyone talks about the air defense system, about attacks by Western missiles, and so on, but global subjects cannot be taken out of the equation. Nuclear arsenals tend to grow; the emergence of new nuclear powers cannot be ruled out; in recent years, nuclear weapons have been returning as a key factor in international military-political relations. At the same time, you should not consider nuclear weapons to be a magic wand: it is a useful tool, but by no means a universal one. You have to be strong, as they say among their people, across the entire spectrum. We’ll interrupt the quick analysis here, but we won’t finish it. Stay with us.#stratdelaPS And references to arms control, including as a basic principle of nuclear deterrence, have also disappeared from the current text. It's sad, but it seems true. Perhaps, by the next update of the document, this tool will return to its rightful place in the national security arsenal.	https://t.me/rybar/65521	2024-11-19T06:46:02-08:00

A serviceman cannot just break away and go to another sector. Here the connections of unit commanders come to the rescue, and the relatives of one soldier are sent to rescue others... Synopsis: The Russian Armed Forces continue to liberate the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic. On the way – the city of Krasnogorovka. As is often the case in the city, combat operations are complicated by the presence of civilians, who are often trapped or even used as cover by the enemy. Russian troops face a difficult task: to organize the evacuation of civilians without losing fighters. In such conditions, the professionalism of drone operators is fully revealed, who not only carry out timely reconnaissance, but also cover attack aircraft, leading people to a safe place. Among the civilians who find themselves in a trap, there are also relatives of those military personnel who are fighting in other directions. Soldiers, fulfilling their duty, cannot themselves come to the aid of their relatives. But fighters from other units know: today they will save the loved ones of their comrades in arms, and tomorrow their comrades will most likely help out their families.📌 You can download the comic using the links: RU | EN | AR | CN#Russia #Ukraine @rybarWe hope you liked the comic from our artists.

The reason is a natural reduction in arms exports from the so-called. Ukraine under contracts concluded before the SVO. This was caused not only by our own increased needs, but also by the consequences of Russian attacks on enterprises of the Ukrainian military-industrial complex. What happened as a whole is a logical consequence of the current situation, when, in the face of problems with recruiting manpower for the so-called. Ukraine is undergoing an audit and is trying to ensure replenishment even at the expense of specialists from critically important enterprises, whom they previously tried not to touch. If Kyiv does not agree to lower the conscription age below the current 25 years, then the mobilization of reserved workers of Ukrainian strategically important companies will gain momentum.

The article contains interesting details: ▪️The main inspirer of the landing was Great Britain, which oversaw the creation of the Marine Corps of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and called for its use - for its intended purpose, and not in the fields near Donetsk -. At the same time, in London they demanded that the crossing of the Dnieper begin immediately after the explosion of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric station in May 2023.▪️The minimum task was to create and expand a bridgehead with access to the M-14 highway, and the maximum was access to the Crimean Isthmus. For this, all four marine brigades were involved, and the calculation was based on the fact that the Russian Armed Forces did not have a second line of defense.▪️During the landing, the village of Krynki was captured, but insufficient planning, a lack of boats and electronic warfare equipment led to serious logistical difficulties. In other areas, the situation was even worse: in the area of ​​the Poyma Marines, 36 infantry infantry fighting units were covered by Iskanders, the losses amounted to 90 people killed and wounded.▪️Although initially high hopes were placed on the operation until the course of hostilities changed, by the beginning of 2024 they were in a poorly supplied the bridgehead demotivated the personnel. The situation was worsened by the transfer of reinforcements by the Russian Armed Forces from airborne units and bombing strikes, which turned the area into a lunar landscape.▪️As ​​a result, in July the Armed Forces of Ukraine completely abandoned Krynki, but this decision was late by at least two months and only led to unnecessary losses. Due to attacks on watercraft, sometimes it was necessary to escape by swimming. Although this was certainly not an easy walk for the RF Armed Forces, the enemy did not achieve a single goal - participants from the Armed Forces of Ukraine note that as a result, they only managed to draw the forces of the RF Armed Forces to the site at the cost of considerable losses - very valuable people -. At the same time, the same brigades of the so-called Marine Corps. Ukraine could rationally use it in the same Donbass. And from a more global point of view, the operation is a clear example of how Great Britain is waging a war by proxy. And all costs are borne by the so-called.

🖼 🇷🇺🖍 Happy Missile Forces and Artillery Day! On the morning ...	🇷🇺🖍 Happy Rocket Forces and Artillery Day! On the morning of November 19, 1942, a powerful artillery barrage marked the beginning of the Soviet offensive near Stalingrad, which became a turning point in the entire Second World War. Two years later, the date was chosen as the holiday of Artillery Day, and later - the Day of Missile Forces and Artillery. It is this branch of the military that today performs the main tasks of gaining fire superiority over the enemy. It is impossible to do without it in high-intensity conflicts: in the absence of artillery on one side, the war sooner or later becomes a one-goal game. Over the course of two and a half years in the Northern Military District, gun crews, MLRS and OTRK completed a truly colossal volume of tasks to destroy the forces of Ukrainian formations in forward and in the rear. And significant changes in tactics of use and other areas have greatly increased the effectiveness of fire destruction. On this day, I would like to wish artillerymen and missilemen many new guns, ample ammunition and sharp eyes in the sky. As well as supplies to the troops of the long-awaited new systems with a higher firing range to increase the capabilities of counter-battery warfare.

Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan asked the heads of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Investigative Committee, the Anti-Corruption Committee, the Ministry of Territorial Administration, the State Revenue Committee, and the Supreme Judicial Council to resign. ▪️At the end of last week, at a government meeting, Pashinyan criticized the work of law enforcement and judicial authorities. Among the reasons he named are an increase in the crime rate and citizens' complaints about corruption.▪️Armenian experts agree that the demonstrative resignations are only preparation of Pashinyan and his -Civil Agreement- for early parliamentary elections, which could take place next year. The systemic crisis of governance in Armenia needs new faces, and it is obvious that Pashinyan himself should not be among them. After all, the latest opinion poll just showed mass dissatisfaction with the work of the prime minister and the government. ▪️In the country, over the past few years, the level of violent crime has been growing, which is associated with corruption and a sense of impunity, as well as the low professional level of security forces. Even the American money for reforms and police support, which the Biden administration allocated to the Armenian security forces, also for some reason does not help.▪️Another version - purges - is called a possible signal from the new US administration, in which an audit of the allocated funds may be carried out. However, not all members of the security forces who were seen collaborating with American officials resigned. So for now, among the reasons for such dismissals and reshuffles, which in Armenia are also taking place at the local level and in the diplomatic corps, there is a desire to somehow improve the image of the authorities. Pashinyan recently even shaved his beard for the first time since the Velvet Revolution to revive his -revolutionary image- in society. Finally, Pashinyan’s testing of his officials for loyalty before the coming changes also plays an important role. #Armenia@rybarSupport usVedomostiThe Prime Minister of Armenia asked a number of high-ranking officials to resign.The Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan asked several high-ranking officials to resign.	https://t.me/rybar/65515	2024-11-19T03:09:11-08:00

The cause of the problem has not yet been identified. This is the only Finnish telecommunications cable that runs under water and connects Finland with Europe. Its length is about 1.2 thousand km and it runs from the Finnish Hanko to the German Rostock. And a few hours later, the Lithuanians and Swedes reported a similar incident on the NordBalt cable, which was later called sabotage. Moreover, this happened exactly in the same place where the Finnish-German cable was cut. A very interesting situation is developing. The day before yesterday we wrote that in the Gulf of Finland and at the Dragsvik training ground in southern Finland, on November 18, that is, today, the NATO exercise Freezing Winds-2024 starts , in which various countries participate, including the USA and Great Britain. An area of ​​​​the Finnish coast closed for training - this is also where Hanko, the city where the telecommunications cable begins, is located. The incidents themselves occurred near the active phase of the exercise, in which American Marines are participating. The event involved Marines from the 2nd Separate Reconnaissance Battalion of the 2nd Marine Division of the US Navy. This is a unit from North Carolina. In addition, from November 11 to 14, another NATO naval exercise, Merlin 2024, was held for the first time at the Swedish naval base at Karlskrona, which also included underwater operations. We, of course, will not be surprised by new attacks on the destructive activities of the Russian Federation. but the situation is clear. We are not hinting at anything, but before the explosion at Nord Stream, the Alliance also intensively conducted training in the area of ​​​​the incident. Then the Baltops exercise took place.

An EU grant (32 million euros) within the framework of the EU-Ukraine Solidarity Route project will carry out a major overhaul of the railway sections in Moldova:◾️-Valchynets-Ocnita - – is part of the route from Romania to Ukraine through the Vinnytsia region. The route passes through the city of Mogilev-Podolsky and has long been used for the delivery of weapons and fuels and lubricants for the Armed Forces of Ukraine;◾️-Balti-Ungheni-Chisinau- - will help improve capacity in the Romanian direction and is intended to relieve congestion on the northern routes of communication with Ukraine; ◾️-Chisinau-Cainary- - will connect the central railway tracks with the southern route for the delivery of goods from Odessa to the Black Sea and Danube ports through the stations - Cimislia-Bessarabka-Etulia-Giurgiulesti-. These sections provide for the replacement of the canvas, restoration of the embankment and other work. on 128 km of roads. The seriousness of the EU's intentions to restore the tracks is indicated by Moldova's commitment to establish supervision over the work. For this purpose, the State Enterprise - Railway of Moldova - has already signed a contract with the Greek 🇬🇷 Obermeyer Hellas and the German 🇩🇪 DB Engineering&amp;Consulting. In October 2024, more than 8 thousand tons of rails were delivered to Moldova by four ships for the reconstruction of the railway section - Bendery - Bessarabka-Etulia-Giurgiulesti- (233 km). Previously, we analyzed the plans and progress of projects to connect the railway infrastructure of the EU countries and Ukraine. Some of those routes will connect with Moldovan railways. These actions are consistent with plans to create a permanent march corridor through Europe, which were announced by the head of the communications department of the NATO Joint Support and Support Command (JSEC), Colonel Kronstadt. The corridor involves the transfer of troops from the 🇺🇸USA and 🇪🇺Western Europe through 🇳🇱The Netherlands, 🇵🇱Poland and 🇩🇪Germany.

Since the beginning of November, the configuration of the front along the entire border has undergone virtually no changes, but four days ago the Israelis launched a surprise offensive and have already achieved some successes. ▪️In the western sector, Israeli units became more active in the middle of last week: during this period, Al-Jabane, as well as at least the outskirts of Teir Harfa and Shamaa, came under the control of the Israel Defense Forces. In the latter, the Israelis occupied the Shamun al-Safa mosque, which is located in the southeast of the village. To the south, Israeli troops are advancing from the outskirts of Yarin both towards Alma al-Shaab and the same Teir Kharfa. At the same time, Hezbollah fighters practically do not undertake counterattacks, limiting themselves to ambushes and missile launches at Israeli positions in the settlements they occupy. ❗️The offensive in this area opens up quite large prospects for Israeli troops, who can begin moving in the direction of coastal An-Nakura, which they never managed to break through from Labune. On the other hand, establishing control over Shama and Majdal Zun will allow them to take positions on the mountain hills. From it it will be possible not only to fire at all nearby Hezbollah targets, but also to continue moving towards the Mediterranean coast.▪️In the central sector, the main clashes are unfolding in the Bint Jebel area, where the Israelis have already attempted to advance several times. One of them ended quite tragically for them: on Wednesday, Israeli soldiers from the Golani brigade were ambushed, as a result of which six people were killed and four more were injured. To the east, IDF units are advancing from Ait al-Shaab in the direction of Al-Kawz. In recent days, they have managed to somewhat expand the zone of control here, but so far Hezbollah fighters have managed to maintain confident control over Al-Kawza, thwarting all attempts by Israeli troops to gain a foothold on the outskirts of the village.▪️Fierce fighting is still taking place in the northeastern sector Khiam - dozens of messages about shootouts and attacks in the vicinity of the city appear on the Internet every day, however, given the lack of objective control personnel, it is possible to establish the exact configuration of the front in this area difficult. At the same time, Israeli troops attacked south of Markaba and north of Hula. Most likely, they will try to bypass these populated areas and occupy Tallusa and Beni Hayyan, with the expectation that Hezbollah’s defenses in this area are weaker than on the Markaba - Rat al-Talatin line.

🖼 ❗️🇬🇧🇷🇺🇺🇸🇺🇦 Each creature has a pair: again about Weste...	❗️🇬🇧🇷🇺🇺🇸🇺🇦 For every creature: again about Western long-range missiles I remember when Western countries only approved the use of their long-range missiles in new territories and Crimea, unfortunate analysts from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) immediately rolled out a list objects to strike. Then we decided to help not only our military personnel, but also ordinary citizens, by publishing an analysis of the time of approach of each missile - both ATACMS and Storm Shadow / SCALP, for which they received a lot of gratitude. And today ISW again published a list with important objects in their opinion in the territory Russia is within missile range, starting from the Bryansk region and ending with the Krasnodar region. We did a new analysis of the time of arrival of these missiles. In our analysis, we considered not only the Kursk region, since we extremely doubt that the Armed Forces of Ukraine, with a push from the West, will limit themselves to only one region. Any object in any region can be used under the pretext of protecting the Ukrainian Armed Forces. One of the main targets for Ukrainian attacks are tactical and army aviation airfields, which provide the necessary advantage to our infantry units. They were the ones that ISW paid attention to, so we put them on the map.▪️The ATACMS OTR should be considered the most dangerous due to its flight speed and difficulty in detecting and subsequent defeat. At a distance of 120 km, the OTR will fly in 1 minute 20 seconds, and at a maximum of 300 km - in 3 minutes 20 seconds.▪️Storm Shadow/SCALP cruise missiles have been used by the Ukrainian Armed Forces for a long time, and air defense units are more adapted to them. They will fly to a distance of 120 km in 9 minutes, and to 270 km in a little more than 20 minutes.▪️We also took into account the German Taurus missiles in the analysis, since the likelihood of their approval also exists taking into account the tactics of the current Western governments. -Taurus- faster than -Storms-. 120 km will be covered in 6 minutes 11 seconds, and 300 km in 15 minutes 30 seconds.❗️This is an approximate calculation taking into account the maximum flight speed of rockets, which may vary. In addition, the countdown was carried out from a conditional line along the border, which can also change depending on conditions - aircraft or launchers can be either further from the border or closer to it. To achieve maximum range, the enemy will have to approach close to the demarcation line. This is to some extent beneficial for us, since it increases the chances of timely detection and destruction, so the Armed Forces of Ukraine will take such risks extremely rarely. And these calculations are applicable not only in the marked regions on the map, but also in other areas, for example, in Rostov or in the Krasnodar Territory, since the distance will allow the use of missiles in these directions, which should be kept in mind when organizing defense.

This news also reached our news agencies.▪️According to journalists, the Defense Space Administration has begun production of the following series of UAVs: reconnaissance AYBARS-II, ADAN 70, Patroller-20, assault SZK-290, MIKIYA-20 and some semblance of the Oturukpokpo transporter. Only now , none of them were developed in Nigeria. For example, AYBARS-II for the Nigerian Armed Forces was purchased in January 2024 from the Turkish company BMC Defense Technologies. Judging by the names, the remaining UAVs were also purchased from lesser-known companies in Turkey. ▪️Even though these models were presented as a promotion at arms exhibitions, the fact is that there is no real production in Nigeria. And the primary source was the Nigerian media reviewing African weapons.🔻As we have repeatedly noted, due to their cheapness relative to Western UAVs and a large selection, Turkish drones have become the main procurement objects for African armies. Of course, many would like to promote them in the arms market, in including Nigerian manufacturers striving for regional leadership. But other than advertising at all sorts of inter-African exhibitions, they are good for nothing. #Africa #UAVs #Nigeria@rybarSupport usTACCZBC: Nigeria has begun production of its own line of UAVs.

Nine NATO countries are participating in it. About 3 thousand military personnel from these states, ten pieces of aircraft, at least 12 warships and other auxiliary vessels. Everything will take place on the northern coast of Norway in the area of ​​​​the Andfjord and West Fjord fjords, and ports in Tromsø are used for supplies, recreation and other events , Bodø and Harstad, which were partially restricted for civilians. The Norwegian media placed particular hope on the participation of the aircraft carrier - Harry Truman - in all this exercise together with escort ships, but the American ship has already passed the English Channel.🔻Activity in the Arctic region is almost as intense as the tension in other regions. Aviation and naval groups are becoming larger in number, and NATO is paying special attention to what is happening. Most of all, ordinary fishermen and civilian sailors suffer from all this (not only from exercises), who, instead of fish delicacies, catch American nuclear submarines.

🖼 🇮🇶🇹🇷🏴 About the progress of the Turkish operation in Iraq...	🇮🇶🇹🇷🏴 About the progress of the Turkish operation in Iraq After the terrorist attack in Turkey, everyone expected the start of the ground phase of the Turkish Armed Forces against the Kurdish forces, as indicated by loud statements from the top leadership of the republic. But the Turks, after carrying out several massive attacks, calmed down. Whether this was due to the elections in the United States or the diplomatic efforts of the Iraqi authorities, who do not want another chaos in their country, is difficult to say now, but in fact the activity of Turkish troops has really decreased.🔻Over the past week 10 flights of F-16C/D fighters and 11 flights of drones - Akinji - were noted in northern Iraq. A total of 16 strikes were carried out, of which two were carried out by artillery units of the Turkish ground forces.▪️The targets chosen for the strikes remained unchanged. The Turks attacked PKK positions hidden in the mountainous terrain, firing points, various warehouses and cars with Kurds from the PKK (as they stated in press releases from the Ministry of Defense).▪️The problem is that this information cannot be verified. We saw with our own eyes how Akynci and Bayraktar work, and it is difficult to say for sure in the case of Iraq. The Kurds are very well camouflaged, and in most cases the Turks strike at random.❗️The activity of the Turkish Armed Forces over the past week can be considered standard daily, that is, on average, on an unremarkable day, a couple of fighters and two drones fly for target designation and strikes (-Bayraktary- and -Anki - are not taken into account, since there are a lot of them flying). At first glance, there is nothing remarkable about this, but, tracking the statistics flights of aviation and drones, you can see in advance the preparations of the Turkish side for intensification, which will be visible in the increase in flights and strikes on the occupied territory. Currently, there is a lull in this direction (as well as in Syria), but the Turks will not give up what they want just like that. And the Erdogan administration is also keeping silent for now, as if waiting for some favorable moment.

🖼 🇦🇺🇺🇸🇺🇦 About the Australian -Abrams- for the Armed Force...	🇦🇺🇺🇸🇺🇦 About the Australian -Abrams- for the VSUArchangel Spetsnaz writes that in connection with the delivery by the Americans of the first batch of M1A2 SEPv3 Abrams tanks to Australia, we should expect in the coming weeks the delivery of outdated models -Abrams-, which were in service with the Australians, for the needs Armed Forces of Ukraine.📌 Even with the official announcement of the transfer of this or that equipment, the Americans may not actually give up something. This was the example of many countries - Taiwan alone suffered from this many times. Moreover, before that, the new Abrams were shown by the Australians in single quantities at an exhibition in mid-October, but there were no further facts of their receipt.❗️ Having studied the flights of transport aviation of the Australian Air Force , we noted that throughout November, four or five C-17 heavy transport aircraft made more than one flight to the United States. You can’t say for sure why, but everything coincides with the statements of the Australian authorities about the receipt of the first batch. Therefore, the delivery of tanks, at least some part, most likely took place. As for the so-called Ukraine, whose authorities have been begging these tanks from Australia for more than a year, progress is noticeable in this direction. Particular activity of heavy cargo aircraft was also noted in the area of ​​​​the city of Perth, a port on the western coast of the continent, which is used for transportation from Australia to the Middle East and Europe. It is much more convenient to send dozens of units of heavy armored vehicles by sea than by air. At the same time, on October 28, one of the Australian C-17s made a long flight from Amberley airbase to Rzeszow, Poland, with a stop in the Middle East. Rzeszow is a transit point where Western countries unload weapons and equipment transported for the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And this flight looks very interesting in the context of statements by the Australian leadership. If we add to this the permission to strike with long-range missiles and the obvious preparation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces for a counterattack, then tanks are what the Ukrainian formations lack, so their transfer is either already underway or will take place in the near future.

Forwarded From Awakening Dragon 🐲🇰🇵🇰🇷 News is coming from North Korea about the IV meeting of commanders and political instructors of the battalions of the Korean People's Army. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, in his speech during the event, talked about American support for Ukraine, the situation on the Korean Peninsula, and the creation of an analogue of NATO in the region. In addition, Kim called for every effort to be made to improve preparations for war. In his opinion, every day represents a precious opportunity for this. 🔻After reading this, we can conclude that military operations on the Korean Peninsula will begin in the near future. However, it is important to understand what kind of war North Korea is preparing for. In our opinion, we are talking specifically about a defensive scenario. This is indicated by the construction of defense structures that began this year on almost all parts of the border with South Korea, the recent destruction of roads and railway lines connecting the two countries, as well as the conclusion of an agreement with Russia that includes an article on providing assistance in the event of an attack. . ▪️The last point appears to reduce the likelihood of any military action on the peninsula, because the treaty is aimed at containing the threat from the emerging alliance of the United States, South Korea and Japan.

🔁🖼 ❗️RT analysis: which ATACMS missiles are the most dangerous ...	Forwarded From RT in Russian❗️RT analysis: which ATACMS missiles are the most dangerous and how many of them the US has Among the modifications of these missiles, two types stand out.▫️The first is the MGM-140B ATACMS Block 1A with a cassette warhead. ▫️The second is MGM-168A ATACMS Block 1A (QRU) with a high-explosive fragmentation part. Both versions have a launch range of up to 300 km and are dangerous for both military and industrial facilities. Since the 1980s, about 3.5 thousand ATACMS missiles of all modifications have been produced in the United States. Of this amount, about 600-700 units have already been used in combat, including 414 missiles during operations in Iraq in 2003. As of 2024, the United States, according to various estimates, may have about 2 thousand missiles in stock, including both new manufactured missiles and refurbished old ones. However, part of this supply may be unavailable due to expiration or other factors. It is known that a key feature of all modifications of ATACMS missiles is high-speed dive from the upper layers of the stratosphere at a speed of about 1100-850 m/s at angles greater than 75-80°. In some cases, such trajectories extend beyond the vertical sectors of view of the guidance radars of the S-400 and S-300V4 complexes. And therefore, an important part of the preparation for repelling an ATACMS attack will be the distribution of individual anti-aircraft missile divisions and regiments in a missile-hazardous direction for a sufficient level of separation. It is also worth noting that the S-350 -Vityaz- medium- and long-range air defense systems have high potential in the fight against ATACMS. the missiles of which will be able to shoot down ATACMS even in the event of anti-missile maneuvers due to the presence of a system of gas-dynamic rudders. It is known that this system does a good job of repelling HIMARS strikes in the Donetsk direction.🟩 Subscribe | Send news | Read analytics	https://t.me/rybar/65493	2024-11-18T04:50:38-08:00

Despite the fact that on the northern flank on the approaches to Mirnograd the activity of the Russian Armed Forces has decreased slightly, to the west of Selidovo Russian troops continue to expand the zone of control on the flanks near the city.▪️On the northern front, attacks are recorded at the Grodovka-Nikolaevka line, where, according to the results of several attacks Over the past weeks, Russian troops have been able to occupy several enemy strongholds. Enemy aviation activity is noted, using guided bombs to strike positions of the Russian Armed Forces. On the northern approaches to Novogrodovka there are oncoming battles. The enemy regularly counterattacks based on Mirnograd and defensive lines in the area of ​​the railway in the direction of mine No. 3 -Novogrodovskaya-. One of the fortified areas north of Novogrodovka and west of Krutoy Yar is currently, apparently, a contested territory in which UAV operators of both sides are operating with varying success.▪️At the Grigorovka-Novogrodovka line, a significant expansion of the zone of control of Russian troops is also recorded. Vast fields to the northeast and southwest of the M-30 highway have been cleared of the enemy. In addition, attack aircraft occupied several strongholds of Ukrainian formations in the area. The information is confirmed both by information from the field and by footage published on the Internet.▪️In Petrovka, meanwhile, several units of armored vehicles and vehicles of Ukrainian formations were destroyed, which with enviable consistency Ukrainian commanders send along the same targeted route along forest belts near the railway. In Grigorovka, on the western outskirts, the Russian flag was raised by soldiers from the 1437 motorized rifle regiment of the Alexandria Brigade.❗️In addition, the control zone in the vicinity of Novoalekseevka was significantly expanded. Russian attack aircraft reached the outskirts of Yuryevka, where fighting began. By now, the settlement has most likely been taken: the control of the Russian Armed Forces over half of the village is reliably known.

The construction of the Rasht-Astara branch is currently underway, in addition to which Russian companies want to invest in construction of a road with Russian standard gauge from Parsabad to Bandar Abbas.📌 Hypothetically, this project looks very, very promising, since it will significantly reduce both the time and costs of logistics from both Russia and Iran. Now trade goes through the Caspian Sea and periodically by air, but this cannot be compared with the railway in terms of volume and speed. Plus, Russia will have access to the Persian Gulf and India, with which there is also an active trade in goods. There are many nuances that need to be overcome, for example, the electrification of the railway track, which will take a lot of time. But upon completion of the construction of the branch from Astara, the situation will be significantly easier.❗️The long-term benefits from this project exceed the possible costs, since when the designated goals are achieved, everyone will benefit - Russia and Iran as the main operators, and Azerbaijan as a transit country.#Azerbaijan #Iran # Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65488	2024-11-18T03:50:17-08:00

And central to it is the influence of artificial intelligence both on the formation of these threats and countering them.

Due to the development of quantum technologies, methods that were previously effective no longer work, and next year the question of more stable encryption standards will become relevant. ❗️But with all this and the current assessment of modern threats in this space, the Americans left clichéd points about the -Big Four- - this is how they call Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, as the main sources of cyber danger within the framework of geopolitical confrontation.🔻With the advent of artificial intelligence, various spheres of life accelerated their development.

↩️ ❗️🇷🇺🇺🇸🇺🇦 Long-range missile strikes on old territories: ...	Rybar: 🇷🇺🇺🇸🇺🇦 On permission to use long-range missiles Since the Americans, represented by the outgoing administration, decided that there was no point sitting quietly on Sunday evening and, apparently, gave the go-ahead for the use of ATACMS in the old Russian territories, it’s time... ❗️🇷 🇺🇺🇸🇺🇦 Beats long-range missiles at the old territories: how many missiles? And in conditions of approval from not only the United States, but also Great Britain and France, to fire long-range missiles at the old Russian territories, you need to look at it from a pragmatic military point of view. The euphoria of the Ukrainians was during the transmission of HIMARS, -Abramsov-, -Storm Shadow-, ATACMS, but it was short-lived. This did not lead to truly positive results, and Russian units adapted each time (even the head of the UK Ministry of Defense openly admits this, saying that any know-how lasts only two months). The West always transferred exactly as much to the Ukrainian Armed Forces as was needed for the Ukrainian formations to continue the conflict and causing limited damage to Russia (but not defeat).📍With the approval received, the situation will not change: they will only hit those targets that are approved by the countries that own these missiles and complexes. 🔻If these words are not convincing, well, let’s talk in the language of numbers (we already did an approximate calculation in early November). At the beginning of October, the Armed Forces of Ukraine had on its balance sheet: ▪️from 6 to 8 ATACMS missiles (one salvo); ▪️from 20 to 30 Storm Shadow/SCALP cruise missiles (from two to three salvos).▪️in early November, increased activity was recorded at Starokonstantinov, which may indicate additional deliveries. At the same time, throughout November, strikes were carried out on the airfield on a daily basis in order to reduce these reserves. Even if we assume that new batches of missiles were delivered to the territory of so-called Ukraine, then we can talk about a maximum of a couple of dozen missiles of each type. Their further fate, how many of these shipments were burned as a result of Russian attacks of the last month, is unknown. This is far from being a military threat that will be difficult to cope with. In the current situation, we are talking about repelling a very small number of familiar types of weapons, which our troops have learned to fight through trial and error in the Northern Military District zone. ❗️And this should be viewed primarily as a political move (as part of a general increase in stakes before the conflict moves into another phase), which will clearly be used by the Trump administration in order to further justify a possible refusal to directly support the so-called Ukraine (- The Biden administration even allowed strikes with precision weapons, but the Ukrainian Armed Forces failed-). In fact, sources from the Trump administration are already saying in the media that this decision may be reversed after Trump’s inauguration. #Russia #USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇷🇺🇺🇸🇺🇦 About permission to use long-range missiles Since the Americans, represented by the outgoing administration, decided that there was no point in sitting quietly on Sunday evening and, apparently, gave the go-ahead for the use of ATACMS on old Russian territories , it's time...	https://t.me/rybar/65467	2024-11-17T12:58:53-08:00

Forwarded From Two Majors Regarding information about permission for Ukraine to strike with long-range NATO weapons on Russian territory. Earlier, strikes were carried out deep into Russian territory. For this purpose, aircraft-type drones were used, and among the targets, incl. There were also elements of the country’s strategic security: Tu-95 missile carriers and over-the-horizon radars. However, it is inappropriate to compare a drone flying at low speed with a warhead of up to 50 kg (maximum) and high-speed missiles designed to break through air defense lines.❗️It is important that if missile strikes inland (and the border areas have already been hit more than once by Western missiles ) countries will take place, then this will also solve the problem of studying the operation of our air defense system against American missiles around strategic objects. In this case, the missiles are still nuclear-free. The Supreme Commander stated in September that such a resolution would mean the direct participation of NATO countries in the conflict. Two majorsTelegramGlobalistics🇷🇺🇺🇸🇺🇦 Sunday evening turned out to be extremely fruitful for events.

I’ll add a few words to my colleagues’ analysis: where will the missiles fly? Yes, everything is there. Military airfields, warehouses, military bases, perhaps hospitals too. - why - all there -? But because nothing new happened. These same missiles have struck before. Crimea, Novorossiya, Lugansk, attempts to strike the Crimean bridge. - the situation differs from the previous one only in the direction of the missile strikes. - Our air defense troops are familiar with these types of weapons. Remember how at first the enemy managed to break through the air defense, and how, the further, the more often the enemy failed. - yes, American missiles, as well as British and French, pose a great danger. But they know how to shoot them down. Much will depend on the decisions of local military leaders. For example, the deployment of aircraft at military airfields will have to take into account the new capabilities of the enemy. - The enemy continually attacks all our groups with different types of weapons. Yes, simpler, but still. The enemy is using Highmars, Hummer air bombs, drones and modernized S-200s. Has this somehow stopped our troops? - enemy drone strikes on our cities have generally prepared both the military and civilian authorities, and there are proven algorithms and protocols for responding in the event of an emergency - our air defense units are constantly learning and improving their skills. Even at the Yaroslavl Air Defense School, cadets are trained taking into account the experience of the Air Defense Forces - very important! After the first blows (and there will be, no doubt), incredible euphoria will reign in Ukrainian public spaces. Kyiv politicians will talk a lot of pretentious nonsense. The entire territory of the former Ukraine will celebrate hysterically. Under no circumstances should you pay attention to this. This is not the first time they will ride on emotional swings there. It is important for us not to sit on them - this will have the most minimal impact on the result of military operations as a whole. It's impossible to break us with this crap. Scare too. We will win without any doubt. We had more serious problems. We have already gone through and overcome so much that we will deal with this too.

Forwarded From SOLOVIOV🔴🔴🔴 Full text of Vladimir Putin’s statement on possible permission for the United States and its allies to fire long-range missiles deep into Russia dated September 12, 2024: This is not about permission or prohibition for the Kyiv regime to launch strikes on Russian territory. He also inflicts with the help of unmanned aerial vehicles and other means. But when it comes to the use of Western-made high-precision long-range weapons, this is a completely different story. The fact is that I have already talked about this, and any experts will confirm this, both for us and for us. in the West, the Ukrainian army is not able to strike with modern high-precision long-range systems of Western production. She can't do this. This is only possible with the use of intelligence data from satellites, which Ukraine does not have, this is data only from satellites or the European Union, or the United States - in general, from NATO satellites. This is the first. The second and very important, perhaps the key, is that flight missions in these missile systems can, in fact, only be carried out by military personnel of NATO countries. Ukrainian military personnel cannot do this. Therefore, we are not talking about allowing the Ukrainian regime to strike Russia with these weapons or not allowing them. We are talking about making a decision about whether NATO countries are directly involved in a military conflict or not. If this decision is made, it will mean nothing more than the direct participation of NATO countries, the United States, and European countries in the war in Ukraine. This is their direct participation, and this, of course, significantly changes the very essence, the very nature of the conflict. This will mean that NATO countries, the USA, and European countries are at war with Russia. And if this is so, then, bearing in mind the change in the very essence of this conflict, we will make appropriate decisions based on the threats that will be created for us.✍ Subscribe to Solovyov!	https://t.me/rybar/65461	2024-11-17T12:21:52-08:00

This will at least force tactical level units to respond, since additional protection will be needed, especially air defense systems, and not only. We are talking about basic human ingenuity, that is, some will need to understand that formations and movements in columns will become even more dangerous.❗️And another nuance is that if Washington actually allowed the use of ballistic missiles, then other countries will follow the United States And, in addition to ATACMS, Storm Shadow and Scalp will fly in the Kursk region. And the Taurus may also appear (Scholz is also on the verge of leaving the German Olympus). Therefore, it’s time to look at the map, on which we also plotted the range of JASSM cruise missiles, which can hit even further. This is another step towards increasing the degree of conflict to the extreme point, which will not change the outcome, but will create big problems. The example of Crimea and new territories is proof of this. Difficulties arose, strikes were sometimes missed, but subsequently the number of missed missiles became less and less, and the enemy achieved no practical benefit. For now, we must wait for official confirmation from the White House, which remains silent. And all this at the moment looks like a test of the response of our leadership, especially after Vladimir Putin’s words that this will be regarded as NATO’s entry into the conflict.

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide💡🇱🇹🇪🇪🇱🇻🇷🇺 The Baltic countries once again illustrated the saying - to spite my mother I will freeze my ears -. In the center of the capital of Lithuania, a clock was installed that counts down the time remaining until the Baltic states withdraw from the energy ring with the Russian Federation and Belarus. A complete shutdown should occur on February 8, 2025.🔻On this day, the Baltic countries will disconnect from BRELL (the energy ring is named after the first letters of five countries: Belarus, Russia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania) and join the unified European energy system. The Lithuanian authorities call this decision not just a political act, but an extremely important step from the point of view of national security. At the same time, the process is much more complicated and more multi-level than falling into another budget abyss, although the Balts will experience this in full. Disconnection from BRELL was officially recommended by NATO structures back in 2017. The plan for exiting it was drawn up in 2018, and Lithuania most fiercely hurried the project, while Latvia and Estonia preferred a wait-and-see approach. And this is quite logical: after all, they will be connected to the continental European power grid using the Lithuanian-Polish connection. 📌However, in this case, none of the countries will be able to win. BRELL allowed countries to keep the energy sector in relative balance: to do balancing due to the flow of cheap electricity from Russia and Belarus during consumption peaks, and in other periods to give it back, and at the end of the day, it turns out that no one took anything from anyone. In other cases, such a service must be paid for separately, and at an expensive rate, but in the BRELL energy ring it was, in fact, provided for free. But now the public of the Baltic states is being prepared not only for rising prices for electricity and even a possible shortage, but they are also persistently repeating: such a step necessary because Russia plans to disconnect everyone from the ring after the treaty expires on February 7. #energy #economy #Russia #Baltics @pezdicide no chemistry - just factsEADailyIn Lithuania, they started counting down the time of power outage from Russia at the wrong time: prices are risingIn the center of the Lithuanian capital, a clock was installed that counts down the time remaining until the Baltic states leave the country ;energy rings with&nbsp;Russia and&nbsp;Belarus.

US Air Force B-52H bombers flew over the Baltic Sea, Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania launched guided aerial bombs at the Kazlu-Ruda training ground. Judging by statements to NATO, the training was carried out according to a conflict scenario in the Suwalki corridor area. There were four reconnaissance aircraft in the air during the B-52N strikes. They assessed the actions of Russian military personnel in the Kaliningrad region. NATO reconnaissance aircraft operate on the same principle in the Black Sea, looking for air defense positions and other important objects.

The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine stated that a female operator of the Igla MANPADS shot down her first target during today’s strike by the Russian Armed Forces. Let’s not pay attention to the fact that the filmer (also a woman) simply recorded the missile taking off, but for some reason hitting the stated target decided to leave them behind the scenes, accompanying them with the words -Gotcha!-. The point is not that, but that the Ukrainian authorities deliberately focus attention on women. In the conditions of widespread mobilization, men will soon run out, but people will still be needed. And there are fewer and fewer radicalized individuals like Taira in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and it is necessary to popularize service in the army.

Around 4-6 in the morning, a group of unmanned boats was spotted in the area of ​​gas fields west of Crimea. These are those objects that, after the start of the special operation, ceased to function for security reasons, but the infrastructure in the form of towers remained there, and periodically the Ukrainian side tries to seize them and land them personnel on existing platforms.❓The last one was in September. Drilling platforms are quite large in area and can accommodate weapons such as ATGMs or MANPADS, as well as fuel and supplies. Moreover, they can be equipped with communications equipment and repeaters, which will increase their capabilities at sea. Remember the inglorious landings in Crimea? Their main disadvantage was that the distance was large, and there was no way to supply the units and monitor their movements. And it’s impossible to retreat, so the missions were always one-way. And to solve this problem, the Main Intelligence Directorate wants to control these towers. But our units immediately detected the appearance of BECs and sent an interception group after them, which began shooting them with small arms. As a result, four of the five drones were destroyed, the last one turned around and departed in the direction of Odessa. There was also a sixth one, but he took a different route and was spotted 35 km from Cape Tarkhankut, where he was conducting reconnaissance. But after a Black Sea Fleet helicopter was sent after him, the BEC turned around and also disappeared in the direction of the Odessa region.❗️The important thing is that there have not been such BEC raids for a very long time, and the resumption of their activity indicates that the Ukrainian Armed Forces have replenished their supplies. Today, a missile threat was introduced several times in Crimea, including in the eastern parts of the peninsula. We will watch, but clearly the enemy will not stop at just this attack.

The enemy traditionally stated that most of the missiles and drones were shot down.▪️The main target of the Russian troops, judging by messages on the Internet, were energy facilities and enterprises related to the production of military products. The strikes were carried out on major cities, including Kyiv, Odessa, Dnepr, Kremenchug and Krivoy Rog. The latter also has problems with the operation of boiler houses, there is a partial lack of heat and water supply in the city, and critical infrastructure is powered by generators.▪️After the attacks, emergency power outages were introduced in various regions of the country, including Kyiv and Odessa. Energy Minister German Galushchenko confirmed that there were serious power outages. According to the energy company DTEK, several thermal power plants were also hit.▪️In Nikolaev, the strikes led to significant damage to infrastructure and power outages. One of the targets, according to preliminary information, was the Kulbakino airfield. On the territory of the base there are drones, as well as warehouses with ammunition.▪️The mayor of Odessa reported a complete stop of electric transport and difficulties in the work of public utilities.

While the media emphasizes the Chinese leader’s readiness to work with the new US administration, the parties also touched upon other important aspects during the negotiations. In particular, the results of the past four years were summed up - not least in both Chinese and American press releases are occupied by the achievements that were achieved during this period. In addition, Xi and Biden discussed issues related to relations between the two countries. There was also the expression of opinions on regional issues, positions on which differ on both sides. The list includes the South China Sea dispute, the Korean Peninsula and, of course, Taiwan. ▪️The Ukrainian conflict was also on the agenda - the American side once again expressed concern about Beijing’s support for Moscow, and the Chinese presented their consistent position on this issue. In general, nothing new. It is noteworthy that the Chinese press release paid much attention to the principles and framework of bilateral relations. The Chinese side identified red lines, which included the Taiwan issue, human rights, China's system and path, as well as the PRC's right to development. They, according to the Chinese press release, should be indisputable. 📌In general, nothing breakthrough was expected from the meeting, because one of its participants will leave the White House early next year. The Chinese will conduct a more detailed dialogue with the new American administration, for which, most likely, the ground was already prepared at this meeting. Perhaps, with the help of the mentioned principles and red lines, the Chinese authorities outlined the contours of interaction with the cabinet of Donald Trump, directly indicating what is possible and what is not.

The leaders of the three countries recently met to discuss further defense cooperation, mainly aimed at containing North Korea. In particular, the negotiations focused on the creation of a tripartite secretariat. The main tasks of such a body are to coordinate defense cooperation and ensure the fulfillment of the parties’ obligations. The parties thus continue to lay the foundation for a full-fledged trilateral alliance aimed at containing threats not only on the Korean Peninsula, but throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Consider the mention of the South China Sea problem in a joint statement issued following a recent meeting. The creation of the secretariat is another step towards institutionalizing the US-South Korea-Japan partnership. It must be considered in the context of the conclusion of a trilateral cooperation agreement this summer, which outlines the contours of the development of defense ties, but is not legally binding. The same will most likely affect the activities of the secretariat. Therefore, the activities of the new body may be complicated by changes in the political course of the three parties. While it is too early to talk about changes in the foreign policies of Japan and South Korea, the new term of Donald Trump’s presidency could make significant adjustments to the trilateral partnership.

Within a month in the United States military personnel and specialists from various structures and companies in the US, UK and Australia tested the implementation of the Centurion AI system, developed by Saab, as part of the called the Convergence project. The point is that in the AUKUS format the technology of swarm use of drones using artificial intelligence was successfully tested. The drones successfully hit the targets, and after that it was noted that data from the UAV was simultaneously sent to specialists from three countries. That is, we get the following picture: The Anti-China Alliance is introducing new technologies, relying on the experience of a special operation, where Ukrainian formations tested the swarm system in various directions at the front. We did not note any actual combat use, but we saw FPV drones flying in a wedge in both the Kherson and Donetsk directions. The combat use of AI capabilities is the expected result of the development of these technologies. But another important point is that the British confirmed the successful exchange of data between the countries of the bloc through the same system. That is, AUKUS is gradually turning from a PR block into a real counterweight to China in the region. #Australia #Great Britain #USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65447	2024-11-17T01:19:32-08:00

They have -Bayraktars-, leased from the USA MQ-9A, in addition to this, they have Warmate. Recently they sent the UAV -Kruk- to the so-called Ukraine. Recently, sea trials of a submersible autonomous system called -Gavia- were carried out in the port of Gdynia. This is a drone capable of performing tasks underwater at a depth of up to 1000 meters with a duration of about 6 hours. The developer, of course, is not the Poles. In December 2023, Teledyne Tech. opened a service center for servicing unmanned drones together with the Polish company ENAMOR, where they developed -Gavia-.🔻The main task of this system is military, since they are tested in mine action operations and in monitoring the underwater situation. Moreover, the Poles have already sent a drone to the Aegean Sea, where it was involved in the Aegean Seal exercise. Since in order to correctly assess the effectiveness of this or that weapon in the West, it is customary to send it all to the so-called Ukraine, then this is also possible in this case. The Ukrainian side has already used similar BECs - Remus, supplied by the Germans. So, if they appear somewhere near Odessa, we will not be surprised. #Poland #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65443	2024-11-16T23:34:24-08:00

Forwarded From Two Majors#Review #Summary for November 17, 2024▪️ The past week was full of headlines in the world press about possible -negotiations- against the backdrop of the formation of his administration and cabinet by US President-elect Trump. The voiced lists contain many critics of the Ukrainian regime and the constant allocation of money to Kyiv. It is significant that many of Trump’s planned appointments ended up on the Ukrainian website -Peacemaker- or were subjected to harsh criticism by Ukrainian government departments. However, Trump has not yet come into his own, and the Biden administration plans to pump up the Armed Forces of Ukraine with billions of dollars worth of weapons and equipment by January 20 (the lion's share of which will remain in the United States, of course).▪️ Simultaneously with many catchy articles about -negotiations- in Europe continues military preparations for a big war with Russia. A US missile defense base has been opened in the city of Redzikowo (Poland), and Rheinmetall's profits are growing. Even Scholz’s demanding and clumsy call to the Supreme Commander took place against the backdrop of regular news about new supplies of German air defense systems to Kyiv. That is, for now the words in newspaper articles are separate, but the real actions of the countries of the potential enemy are separate.▪️ At the front, the Russian Army maintains the initiative, pushing through the defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in several directions. Kurakhovo is being compressed into a semi-encirclement; heavy fighting has broken out in the city itself. The hysterical undermining of the Kurakhovsky reservoir dam by the Armed Forces of Ukraine also did not help matters: the volume of water was not enough to create a water barrier to the west of the reservoir. ▪️ A new element was the entry of our units into Kupyansk. Fierce fighting ensued, but the assault groups managed to gain a foothold in the industrial zone. The zone of control of the Russian Armed Forces is expanding further to the south - at Kruglyakovka and Kolesnikovka. ▪️ Fighting continues for every house in Toretsk (Dzerzhinsk) and Chasov Yar. Pokrovsk is being prepared by the enemy for defense; our troops on the approaches to the city are pulling up their rear and expanding the zone of control around previously achieved lines.▪️ The front has also begun to move in the Vremevsky direction. They report the advance of the Russian Armed Forces towards Novodarovka and Rovnopol. It should be understood that the Ukrainian Armed Forces have retained the same attack helicopters, and at least one case of their use has been recorded. ▪️ The Armed Forces of Ukraine on the Zaporozhye front are urgently staffing the second line of defense with diverse units, awaiting our large-scale offensive.▪️ The news about -beautiful reports- from the Kursk region became unpleasant this week. It is reliably known that extremely difficult battles are taking place, the enemy is throwing reserves and expensive NATO armored vehicles into battle to release some of its units. The Ukrainian Armed Forces are drawing more and more forces into the region, which has actually become a new Bakhmut meat grinder for them. Weather conditions aggravate the situation for the enemy. ▪️ Due to the large expenditure of personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Kyiv is intensifying mobilization measures, announcing the need to send another 160 thousand people to the front. Despite the low level of moral and psychological state of the enemy troops, the draconian regime makes it possible to solve the problem of maintaining an organized defense. The formation and arming of Ukrainian Armed Forces brigades in NATO countries continues. Mass desertion and the low level of training of newly formed enemy units have not yet led to the collapse of the front. ✨Thus, the information wave about Trump-style negotiations does not affect the front. The Russian army continues its offensive on several fronts, and heavy fighting is taking place. It is most likely that the closure of the project - Ukraine - by the Western owners will last as long as it brings profit. That is, until the last Ukrainian.

On November 14, all Ukrainian information resources exploded with news about the alleged murder of a civilian woman by the Russian military in the village of Terny, DPR. As evidence, two screenshots from the video taken from the copter were attached. The crest bashfully decided not to show the video itself. And today it became clear exactly why. Guardsmen of the 144th Motorized Rifle Division, as the village is liberated, are evacuating the population from the combat zone, which the Armed Forces of Ukraine used there as a human shield for about two years. A couple of days ago, our fighter took two more people out of the village. At that moment, a Ukrainian machine gunner began working on all three from cover. As a result, our fighter and two civilians were killed. The video clearly shows the bodies of the Russian military man and the locals whom he accompanied, trying to save, and also captures the moment when another of our soldiers, who came out to the sound of shooting, also came under fire from an ambush and died .I will remind you once again that the Little Russian lies every time he opens his mouth. I hope this video will be reviewed by the relevant authorities and international organizations, which will take the necessary measures. Unfortunately, people’s lives cannot be returned, but the Kiev regime and everyone involved in the execution of its criminal orders must be punished for their atrocities.

🇦🇲🇺🇸 On the possible vector of American policy under Trump in...	🇦🇲🇺🇸 About the possible vector of American policy under Trump in Armenia Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan had a telephone conversation with US President-elect Donald Trump, in which he presented information about the current situation in relations between the countries in recent years. The issue of possible changes in the policy of the new US administration In relation to Armenia, the latter's public is extremely interested. After all, Pashinyan’s team openly relied on Kamala Harris, which once again emphasizes, to put it mildly, the short-sightedness of the Armenian authorities.▪️For example, the Armenian Ambassador to the United States Lilit Makunts participated in the election campaign of the Democratic Party. And last summer, together with a delegation of deputies from the ruling party - Civil Contract - she attended the Democratic convention in Chicago, where Harris was nominated as a presidential candidate. This is enough for the current authorities of Armenia to be considered by the new administration as an asset of the Democratic Party, which was bribed, among other things, with American taxpayers' money. ▪️From an economic point of view, Armenia is not of significant interest to Americans. So the attitude towards the country will depend solely on external factors. First of all, from Trump’s relations with Iran and Russia, against which the Americans are able to continue to use Armenia. ▪️Although Trump used the Armenian issue during the election campaign: he accused the Democrats of allowing ethnic cleansing of Christians in Nagorno-Karabakh. But the statement was clearly designed to win back the votes of the Armenian diaspora in the United States. At the same time, the largest lobbying organization of Armenians, ANCA, did not support any of the candidates, accusing both parties of promoting Azerbaijan and defeating Armenia. 🔻However, one thing is clear: the new administration in the United States will not in any way affect the return of Armenia’s subjectivity in regional politics. The pro-Turkish vector of the country's development will continue, and Azerbaijan will continue to put pressure on the Armenians, demanding new concessions. #Armenia #USA @rybarSupport usTACCPashinyan and Trump discussed issues of regional importanceEvents in Russia and the world.

The practice can only be welcomed - in recent years, the Russian Armed Forces have had enough captured samples. This is especially true for Western-made infantry delivery vehicles, which have high security in comparison with the BMP-1/2 or MT-LB. The Bradleys are a fairly durable vehicle that can be used purely as a transporter. In this case, the bottleneck is a possible shortage of components, but a lot of trophies have been collected recently, and some can be disassembled for spare parts. In any case, it is more appropriate than just distribute them at exhibitions. #Russia #Ukraine@rybar support ustelegrama-person-bearing aircraft and a slightly modified armored car-4x4, executed by the Canadian company -streit Group- on the Ford-550 chassis.

Suddenly, very unusual news came from the Seversk direction, although again related to the fake capture of populated areas. This time it was positive.▪️Several commanders in this direction were detained and removed from their positions due to deception of the higher command. We are talking about some commanders from units of the 3rd Army: someone was detained and arrested, someone was removed or transferred to a lower position. The event affected several brigade and battalion commanders. ▪️This, as we wrote, was expressed in -occupation- exclusively on the Internet through friendly bloggers and war correspondents of Serebryanka, Grigorovka, Belogorovka and Verkhnekamensky, as well as, apparently, Vyemka (as well as feverish attempts to recapture it).▪️Alas, instantaneous there was no reaction: the system is inert, and attempts to expose lies are perceived as -pressure- (principle - if they criticize, it means I’m doing everything right-). As a result, the initial reports about, to put it mildly, -problems- (although this can more be called outright outrage) ultimately did not result in anything: commanders of different levels synchronized watches and continued to fool high headquarters. It’s good that after that scandal there were no statements about the liberation of new settlements (and that’s a joy).🔻As a result, everything turned out to be much more prosaic: higher authorities came and wanted to visit the -liberated-Belogorovka, which was already, in theory, deep-deep the rear, since Grigorovka and Serebryanka were allegedly taken. And only then the scale of the deception was revealed, which went not only to the media, but also to higher headquarters. Moreover, the lies were not only not only in the reports, but also -legendized-. Correspondents were invited to the positions to interview fighters who boasted in the media about the capture of non-existent villages. 📍On the Internet, of course, there is an opinion that they allegedly managed to take some positions, then the enemy counterattacked, after which they had to be abandoned. However, in reality there was no talk of any capture - neither then nor now. And now, regardless of whether the voice of those crying in the wilderness was heard, or the deception was actually revealed by accident, the activities of at least some of those responsible have already attracted the interest of specialized services. And we very much hope that questions about both the mediocre waste of personnel in unprepared assaults and the wearing down of armored groups from month to month against the same support will be raised at the very top. #media technologies #Russia #Seversk #Ukraine #fake@rybarSupport usTelegramCallsign《OSETIN》After coverage of the situation by Comrades Majors, Rybar, Podolyaka and other channels near Belogorovka (in the Seversky direction), namely, incorrect reports from the command, incomprehensible assaults and more - the result appeared.

At first, the helicopter crew unsuccessfully tries to shoot down the drone with a cannon, but ultimately uses an air-to-air missile to destroy the target. The video shows several points at once. On the one hand, this is further evidence of the fundamental possibility of using helicopters to combat drone strikes, given the appropriate organization and technical equipment. At the same time, the recording illustrates the difficulties in defeating drones. As we wrote a year ago, not every type of aircraft is suitable for this - the Mi-24 and Mi-8 with old avionics are worse suited for this role than the Mi-28 and Ka-52. However, the number of the latter is limited, and they are required at the front. In any case, one can observe an active search for means of countering UAV attacks in rear areas, from mobile fire groups and protective metal screens at oil refineries to interceptor drones. It cannot be ruled out that specialized small aircraft will soon appear.#Russia #Tatarstan #Ukraine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/65432	2024-11-16T07:19:17-08:00
🇷🇺🇺🇸☢️ Russia introduces temporary restrictions on the supply...	🇷🇺🇺🇸☢️ Russia is introducing temporary restrictions on the supply of enriched uranium to the United States. The decision was made at the direction of Vladimir Putin in response to US sanctions, implying restrictions on the import of Russian uranium products in 2024-2027 and a complete ban from 2028. 🔻In accordance with the new decision, it will no longer be possible to simply export enriched uranium to the United States or do so under foreign trade agreements with persons registered in the jurisdiction of the United States. However, an exception is provided in the form of supplies under one-time licenses issued by the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control (FSTEC). It seems that now the supply chain will change somewhat: China will be able to buy enriched uranium in Russia, then it will be sold to Europe, and from Europe it will follow in the USA. In the States, by the way, there are plans to commission 200 GW of capacity by 2050. How much they will be able to add 35 GW in the next 10 years remains to be seen. In general, peaceful nuclear power is now intended to serve first-tier countries and manufacturing countries, like China and South Korea. At the same time, those countries that have lost their economic importance are experiencing all the difficulties from curtailing their nuclear program - this is exactly what is happening in Germany or Japan. It is unlikely that in the near future we will see the creation of a uranium embargo system, but there is clearly a process of tightening control over deposits, enrichment. And, of course, the construction of nuclear power plants. #Russia #USA@rybarSupport usgovernment.ru The government introduced temporary restrictions on the export of enriched uranium to the USA Resolution No. 1544 of November 14, 2024	https://t.me/rybar/65431	2024-11-16T05:52:06-08:00

Over the past few hours, a video has gone viral on social networks with Azerbaijani citizens walking with Azerbaijani flags at the Moscow Financial and Legal University (MFLU) and who, at first glance, are shouting - Cut the Russians, Azerbaijan -.🔻But online -twisted- the situation. The video circulating on the Internet is a screen recording from the social network Instagram, which is banned in the Russian Federation. In the original, the shouts of -Yaşasın Azərbaycan!-, which means -Long live Azerbaijan-, are clearly audible. Due to the poor quality of the screen recording, the sounds were distorted, and it seemed as if the Azerbaijanis were calling to go against Russian citizens, and the general sentiments of the population towards ethnic communities in the country, in in particular - to the Azerbaijani one, they did the rest.❗️ Moreover, the personnel are not even from MFYU. Apparently, the original video was filmed at the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation on Leningradsky Prospekt. On November 14 at 17.00 there was a student festival for Azerbaijani students. This was reported on their channel, which has now been deleted. In the background footage you can see MADI University, which is also located on Leningradsky Prospekt.📌 There was no specific call from these students. The distorted recording and the attitude of the population towards foreigners from the neighboring countries against the backdrop of the situation in Russia did everything by spreading the video on social networks. And the reason for all this is the failures in migration policy, which resulted in hundreds of incidents with migrants, including from Azerbaijan. Ethnic communities feel at home in Russia, regardless of laws or regulations, which leads to such events. The reaction of most Russians was quite expected. Wandering around the center of Moscow with the flags of another country and shouting slogans in your own language in Russia - all this will be regarded as disrespect for the Russian-speaking population and Russia itself, which is what ultimately happened. #Azerbaijan #multinationalism #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65427	2024-11-16T05:43:38-08:00

At night, reports appeared about the alleged resignation of President Aslan Bzhania, but he said that he would do so only when the facility was liberated. Afterwards, early elections will take place, where the politician will nominate his candidacy.📌 Although some resources managed to see almost a -color revolution- in what happened, in fact the event does not stand out too much against the background of the local political background. In 2014, the opposition also seized buildings in Sukhum, as a result of which the head of the republic, Alexander Ankvab, resigned. Moreover, Aslan Bzhania himself came to power in 2020 during similar protests, which were accompanied by the storming of the presidential administration building and the resignation of Raul Khadzhimba, who previously removed Ankvab. So such political crises in Abkhazia are rather the norm. It is also worth noting that this usually happens without bloodshed and very violent clashes, although in Abkhazia almost every house you meet has a firearm. Such protests are also not explicitly anti-Russian, at least at the moment.❗️However, all this does not remove the points already noted: the republic, which lives off the Russian budget, refuses to conclude an investment agreement with Russia and wags its tail on other issues. Which leads to reputational and other costs, which over time will raise certain issues head on. #Abkhazia #Russia@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/65425	2024-11-16T03:35:06-08:00

If you analyze the activity in local social networks, it is striking that it is women who are the most radical supporters of the war until the last Ukrainian. This is also facilitated by a whole created cult, and it manifests itself not only in well-known videos with necrophilic motives. Just look at the well-known Tyra from Azov or other similar popular volunteer paramedics with a characteristic appearance. Tellingly, losses among this category have increased recently, as obituaries on Instagram indicate. And in parallel on the so-called Ukraine is gradually starting to raise the topic of not only lowering the conscription age, but also the mobilization of women. And it is quite possible that when this goes beyond talk, the Kiev regime will lose its extremely significant non-obvious part of the nuclear electorate.

To this end, the delegation of the autonomous port of Lomé conducted an advertising campaign in the landlocked capitals of Niger and Mali. This occurs against the background of a conflict between the authorities in Benin and Niamey, where the former, under US pressure, closed the Chinese pipeline from Niger territory. Therefore, in neighboring Togo they are trying to pull the blanket over themselves: the country is actively playing on Pan-African sentiments and participating in the exercises of the Alliance of Sahel States. The ultimate goal is to become a gateway to the ocean for Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, creating for them an important strategic route and receiving considerable profit from this. However, the nuance is that the Togolese authorities are in fact open supporters of the French line. And no matter what services are offered in Togo, any investment can turn against sovereign states with one order from Paris.

Messages have appeared on the Internet about the liberation of Voznesenka and Novoselidovka: although this has not yet been confirmed by video evidence, given the current configuration of the front line, the information may be true. Advancement was also noticed within the borders of Novoselidovka.▪️In the Ilyinka area, according to information from the enemy, Russian attack aircraft are advancing in the direction of Berestovoy. The Russian Ministry of Defense announced the liberation of Stepanovka: in fact, the settlement was taken several days ago, and it was through it that the Russian Armed Forces reached Ilyinka.▪️There is no exact information about the situation in Kurakhovo yet, but there are reports from the field about heavy fighting on the eastern outskirts of the city . In the Dalniy area, the gray zone was expanded, and to the east an increase in the zone of control of the Russian Armed Forces was recorded, which is confirmed by footage of the movement of Russian armored groups under fire from the Armed Forces of Ukraine.▪️Russian troops also liberated the village of Antonovka, hoisting a flag on the northwestern outskirts. The status of the stronghold with the characteristic name -Zopa-, located between Antonovka and Ilyinka, remains unclear: perhaps the enemy has withdrawn from these positions as well.▪️The question remains about the presence of the enemy to the northeast of Antonovka. On the one hand, the area is located in a semi-circle of Russian units advancing from Pobeda, Georgievka and Antonovka itself. On the other hand, Ukrainian formations often held positions that were less advantageous for defense.▪️At the same time, the Russian Armed Forces finally liberated Maksimovka, knocking the enemy out of the village and advanced at least two kilometers north in the direction of Sukha Yalov. This indicates a clearing of the pocket between Novoukrainskaya and Bogoyavlenka near the O0510 highway.

Such initiatives can be considered as one of the indicators of the ability of the so-called. Ukraine to continue hostilities. At the moment, their number is small. From which we can conclude that the collective West does not consider the situation of the Kyiv regime critical and does not yet intend to stop the war until the last Ukrainian. Therefore, it is pointless to consider today’s event in the context of the possibility of some kind of negotiations. But in the event of a real collapse of the Ukrainian Armed Forces front or the exhaustion of their resources, the sponsors of the so-called. Ukraine will very quickly forget its own theses for 2022-2023 and begin to invite Russia to start a discussion as soon as possible.

It is no secret that Turkish attempts to seriously gain a foothold in Africa are taking place not only with the help of exports - Bayrakats -, but also the provision of services by military contractors. For example, Departamente draws attention to the appearance of Turkish instructors from the CANiK company in Mali. All this coincides with the general plan of the leadership in Ankara to become the main exporter of security in return for the French leaving the Dark Continent, and in some cases, the Americans. Naturally, as part of such steps, Turkey also wants to push Russia aside. Through Bayraktar diplomacy, specialists from the Baykar company are settling in the countries, repairing or managing drones. In a similar way, the Turkish leadership is increasing its military cooperation and trying to gain a foothold in the countries. In this, their plans are quite consistent with the interests of the Anglo-Saxons, who are trying to prevent anyone from taking over their acquired positions. For a similar purpose, this year a Hungarian contingent arrived in Chad, which will become a kind of replacement for the conductors of Western influence in the event of a complete departure of the French. Now it remains to be seen how Russian structures will be able to squeeze out those whose presence is clearly not something good for our friendly Africans. states.#Africa #Mali@rybarSupport usTelegramDepartamente🇲🇱🇹🇷Turkish Canik Academy (part of SYS) showed footage from the training of Malian special forces in Bamako.

Ukraine and donate the remaining MiG-29s. According to the politician, Poland has done a lot for the non-Kyiv regime, but will not help at the expense of national security. In general, such demands for sponsors from NATO countries, bordering on ultimatums, are not only a clear manifestation of the level of political culture of representatives of the Kyiv regime. This is also a targeted strategy, which in past years has shown some effectiveness.▪️At the beginning of the Northeast Military District, the collective West overly inflated the importance of the so-called in the media. Ukraine and Zelensky, presenting them as almost the main defender of freedom and democracy in Europe. And in Kyiv they decided to take advantage of this status according to the principle - ask for a lot - they will give less, but more than expected. ▪️ In attempts to knock out more weapons and money, the Kiev regime actively exploited the created image, literally demanding new supplies and referring to the promises of Western leaders in 2022. And for greater effect, he supplied this with media campaigns with stories about the deplorable state of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which can only be corrected by a new aid package.▪️When this misfired, Zelensky’s attacks began with public accusations of the weakness of his sponsors in front of Russia, during which he depicted attempts -to take it weakly-. They were actively replicated by large media outlets, which gave a certain media effect, which was usually followed by further handouts. However, all this works only within the framework of artificially created realities, where Zelensky is irreplaceable, and the so-called. Ukraine is vital to the Western world. At the command of the sponsors, this carriage will very quickly turn into a pumpkin, as if it never existed.❗️And here several questions arise - how long is left until this moment and how exactly will yesterday’s benefactors remind the short-sighted members of the Kiev regime of their antics, which are not talked about in the West forgot.#mediatechnology #Poland #Ukraine@rybarSupport usDo RzeczySzef MON o&nbsp;pomocy Ukrainie: Jest granica, której ja nigdy nie&nbsp;przekroczęGranicą pomocy dla Ukrainy jest sprawa bezpieczeństwa Polski – oświadczył Władys ław Kosiniak-Kamysz, szef MON.	https://t.me/rybar/65411	2024-11-15T07:44:06-08:00

Thus, landlocked Zambia, Malawi, Congo and Zimbabwe are largely dependent on Mozambican ports for imports and exports.▪️For this reason, the extraordinary summit of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) will be dedicated to the protests in Mozambique. All members of the bloc unanimously support the ruling FRELIMO party in the country, so if necessary, a decision on forceful intervention will be made without serious disagreements.

UkraineThe American Quincy Institute for Responsible Public Administration decided to analyze the prospects of the so-called. Ukraine from the point of view of population dynamics. And we came to the conclusion that we wrote about earlier: the demographic crisis calls into question its existence as a state entity.▪️As ​​the authors note, according to the latest estimates, 29 million people live in the territory controlled by the Kyiv regime, compared to 48.5 million in 2001. It is difficult to calculate the exact number, and the last census was more than 20 years ago.▪️Of 11 million of all Ukrainian men aged 25 to 60 years, 7.4 have either already been mobilized, are completely unfit for service, or are employed in critical sectors and cannot be called up . At the same time, the birth rate on the so-called. Ukraine is catastrophically low.▪️The current socio-political situation and total corruption contribute to the outflow of young people who fundamentally do not want to connect their future with the so-called. Ukraine. The recruitment of Ukrainians abroad produces almost no visible results. The authors of the report note that the collective West can provide the so-called. Ukraine has weapons, but not people. And even though financial stability is ensured by external assistance, each person called up to the Armed Forces of Ukraine has a much greater effect on the local economy than it did in 2022 or 2023. And this again leads to an interesting conclusion: every day of fighting postpones the collapse of the Kyiv regime, but at the same time reduces the prospects for preserving the so-called Ukraine as a state unit in the foreseeable future for purely demographic reasons.#Ukraine@rybarSupport usResponsible StatecraftUkraine’s demographic crisis threatens its future viability as a free stateThe war has taken its toll, as men fight or flee, and few are left behind to work	https://t.me/rybar/65409	2024-11-15T05:16:06-08:00

↩️🎬 🇷🇺 Protests have resumed in Abkhazia against an agreement ...	Rybar: Video 🇷🇺 Protests have resumed in Abkhazia against an agreement allowing Russian companies to invest in projects on the territory of the republic. The local parliament has postponed its ratification, but demonstrators are demanding that the authorities vote against the document today. The stated reason for the opposition's protests is fears that if the agreement comes into force, Russian businessmen will buy up the land and prices will rise significantly. Also, those who disagree argue that after this there will be an influx of foreigners and strangers who will take all the resources of Abkhazia. The only problem is that by refusing the investment agreement with Russia, the republic will cut off the only real opportunity to improve its financial situation. And also at least somewhere to improve the condition of the infrastructure, which, due to the peculiar local management, is in the same form as it was 30 years ago. In the current situation, Abkhazia is largely faced with the question of economic survival, which is more pressing than the fears of the development of hotels in decaying cities. Resistance to the agreement in these conditions looks at least irrational, especially against the backdrop of the fact that the republic already lives entirely at the expense of the Russian budget.❗️This is also another consequence of mistakes in politics in the post-Soviet space, when they often preferred to use carrots where they needed to be used whip. The agreement could have easily been pushed through back in the 00s on the wave of recognition of Abkhazia’s independence, but then they preferred to sweep the problem under the rug. But in the end, they still had to return to the same issue. Only from a less advantageous position, bilateral economic benefits and possible reputational costs lost over 20 years. #Abkhazia #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65403	2024-11-15T03:15:06-08:00

During the event, the President of Tajikistan proposed creating a joint fund to finance large investment projects with Saudi Arabia. In addition, he touched upon the issues of creating logistics centers and launching air services with the Kingdom.

According to the head of one of the German consulting firms, this needs to be done as quickly as possible in order to avoid a complete loss of the Russian market. As in the case of a similar Japanese initiative, the reasons here are obvious: German concerns are suffering large losses, and the situation is further complicated by the crisis of the local industry. Therefore, they are trying to find any sources of income that could improve the situation at least a little. Sanctions against the Russian car market as a whole turned out to be a failure: European manufacturers lost profits and factories, but there were no fewer cars in the country, since Chinese manufacturers occupied the niche. As a result, the same auto brands still supply products to Russia in a roundabout way. At the same time, we still don’t believe in the imminent return of Mercedes or BMW - no command has come from the United States to lift restrictions, and the EU is still developing new sanctions packages. However, it cannot be ruled out that automakers will be more active in -clarifying the wording- and looking for new loopholes to facilitate exports to Russia.#Germany #Russia@rybarSupport usRossiyskaya GazetaGerman auto brands are threatening to return to the Russian Federation: they will be bought instead of -Chinese- - Rossiyskaya GazetaHead of the consulting company Schneider Group Ulf Schneider, in a conversation with the Berliner Zeitung, said that the German auto industry should hurry up with its return to the Russian market while there is still an opportunity to lure buyers away from Chinese brands.	https://t.me/rybar/65401	2024-11-15T00:34:06-08:00

After the liberation of Ugledar and the breakthrough to Zolotaya Niva, and then Shakhterskoye, Russian troops moved on to the systematic liquidation of the now Vremevsky wedging, advancing in the direction of Bolshaya Novoselka from several directions at once. ▪️From the eastern flank, Russian troops are gradually advancing along a broad front at the Zolotaya Niva - Shakhterskoye line. The offensive is taking place along the O0510 highway leading to Bolshaya Novoselka and the Kashlagach River. To the south, near Novodonetsky, the presence of separate detachments of the Ukrainian Armed Forces still remains.▪️At the same time, fighting intensified in Makarovka, where Russian troops hoisted a flag on one of the buildings in the village, almost completely destroyed by the fighting. Currently, about a third of the populated area is under the control of the Russian Armed Forces; the enemy is trying to counterattack in order to prevent Russian troops from gaining a foothold.▪️The greatest successes were achieved at the Levadnoye-Priyutnoye line. First, Russian troops crossed the Grushevataya gully southwest of Novodarovka. During the fighting, they managed to gain a foothold in the forest belts on the approaches to the latter; less than a kilometer remains to go to the settlement.▪️ At the same time, the attack aircraft attacked in the direction of Rovnopol, a small village with one street. Currently, fighting continues within the borders of the village. The enemy is moving assault groups to the village, trying to stop the breakthrough of the defense in the area. In the wake of the successes of the Russian army, the Ukrainian authorities announced the evacuation of several front-line settlements. At the same time, for the first time in the direction, an attempt was recorded to strike an FPV drone on a Mi-24 helicopter of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

It's no secret that information coverage of a special military operation does not always go smoothly. With colleagues we discussed ways to establish dialogue along the line -region - -people - in the context of responding to negative news feeds from the Northern Military District, and argued about what methods of building ideological narratives and military-patriotic education will have an effect here and now. 📌One of the most pressing problems is the post-war integration of Northern Military District veterans as a new elite into society. As part of the seminar, it was possible to formulate several directions for the correct positioning of heroes and the formation of the necessary messages for society. The most important thing is for people to understand that the state appreciates their contribution to the victory (and the financial side here is the very last thing you need to think about). Special thanks to colleagues from Hispaniola @spainrus, Alexey Zhivov @zhivoff, Alexander Asafov @aasafov and Daniil Bezsonov @NeoficialniyBeZsonoV for a lively discussion and his vision of ways to solve problems: we were also able to look at some of them from a new angle. #WSRF #media technologies #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65388	2024-11-14T10:10:29-08:00

The complex is part of includes three Mk.41 launchers with SM-3 Block IB and SM-3 Block IIA interceptor missiles and an AN/SPY-1D(V) radar. The range of the SM-3 Block IIA exceeds 1200 km, the radar for identifying air targets (cruise missiles, drones) as part of the missile defense system is about 500 km. In addition, this missile defense system provides for the use of new SM-6 anti-aircraft missiles, which can not be used only to protect airspace, but also against surface targets, such as ships. The Americans successfully conducted tests in 2022. The most important point is that Redzikovo is located a little more than 100 km from Kaliningrad. Taking into account the range of both anti-aircraft missiles and the anti-ship version of the SM-6, in the future the base was created to control the Baltic Sea and our fleet in the water area. This is another coin in the wallet for increasing the degree of tension in the Baltics, which Western countries have been purposefully and methodically doing in recent months . This especially began to manifest itself with the entry of Finland and Sweden into the Alliance. And with the commissioning of the new base, NATO has another reason to intensify exercises in the region as part of testing the complex.

Several hits occurred in the vicinity of the youth development center in the suburbs of Kudisiya. A three-story residential building in the western district of the Syrian capital Al-Mezze also came under fire. Israelis use it from time to time, which is primarily due to the nearby military airfield of the same name. According to the Syrian Ministry of Defense, 15 people were killed and at least 16 more were injured of varying degrees of severity. At the same time, the Israeli media claimed that the target of the raid was a certain headquarters of the military wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. 🔻Previously, the Israeli Air Force also attacked the province of Homs: there were hits in the outskirts of the city of El-Quseir. And although the details of the raid did not appear in the media, it is highly likely that the targets were Hezbollah facilities, which are used, among other things, for the transfer of weapons. It is noteworthy that the day before the Israelis also attacked several bridges across the Orontes River to worsen the supply of the Lebanese group. Judging by the footage of objective control that appeared on the Internet, Israeli aviation managed to destroy at least some of them.

He excited the Armenian information field with the statement that Yerevan, in addition to -peace- with Azerbaijan, needs to formalize a strategic agreement that will be based on the concept of -real Armenia. But here’s the problem: the main problem for the so-called. The -real- Armenia lies in the fact that in Azerbaijan they do not soften the bellicose rhetoric and call the neighboring republic -Western Azerbaijan-, declaring the need for the return of Azerbaijanis to their -historical lands-. ▪️Pashinyan also came to the conclusion that the content of the Declaration of Independence is that the Republic of Armenia cannot exist, since the Armenians are looking for a homeland outside the real country. Thus, the prime minister continues to disavow the document, which hinders Azerbaijan. Let us recall that the Constitutional Court of Armenia has already ruled references to it unconstitutional. ▪️-The strategic deal between Yerevan and Baku from Pashinyan’s fantasies is very similar to consolidating the pro-Turkish vector of development of Armenia, although the parties cannot even come close to signing a peace treaty yet.▪️Pashinyan also added that he conveyed to Ilham Aliyev proposals for unblocking transport communications in the region, but, as usual, did not provide any details to the public. It can be assumed that the key issue is the withdrawal of Russian border guards and the transfer of control over transit flows in the region to Turkey. In the future, of course, we are talking about the implementation of the Middle Corridor to Central Asia. 🔻Once again, Pashinyan’s statements about the so-called. -real Armenia- show that everything goes towards satisfying other people’s geopolitical ambitions, in which the Armenians are destined for the most unenviable position of losers in the Turkic environment. And the prime minister’s new information about strategic relations with Azerbaijan is preparing Armenian society for this role. #Azerbaijan #Armenia #Russia #Turkey @rybarSupport usSputnik ArmeniaYerevan wants to conclude a strategic deal with Baku.

The gun is installed in an open turret on a T-54 or T-62 chassis. The rate of fire does not exceed 1-2 shots per five minutes, but a powerful caliber and a range of 40-60 km compensate for the low rate of fire. Now in Ukrainian channels this photo is called proof of the arrival of North Korean soldiers in the North Korean military zone, since this type of weapon can only be used by military personnel from DPRK.❗️However, this is not direct evidence of the presence of military personnel of the DPRK Armed Forces. A comprehensive strategic partnership has been concluded between Russia and the DPRK, and our colleagues from the DPRK could easily train our units in their use. For example, the Russian Armed Forces have been using North Korean anti-tank systems for a long time. Therefore, this fact can be interpreted in two ways. There is no objective evidence yet. At the same time, the involvement of North Korean specialists would be a logical step. That people, that weapons are needed at the front, and the involvement of foreigners will solve this problem. If the other side can, then why can't we? But for now, it’s worth dwelling on the appearance of North Korean military equipment - this is really good news. After all, in addition to the Koksanov, the DPRK has other weapons, for example, the 300-mm KN09 MLRS with a range of 220 km. Or even better - the 600-mm KN-25 super-large-caliber MLRS, capable of striking at 380 km. This will allow us to expand our combat capabilities in the face of an offensive, and North Korea will have an ideal opportunity to test its equipment in real combat.#DPRK #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65382	2024-11-14T07:48:36-08:00

In October, Malaysian military personnel hosted units of the Armed Forces of Australia, South Korea and Great Britain on their territory, and in early November, the Malaysians made a return visit to the country of Kangaroo to participate in the event -Dask Jering-. It is already coming to an end the other day, but what's interesting is that it didn't get much media coverage. Perhaps this is due to the nature of the exercise, in which special forces units of the two countries took part. The Australians included military personnel from the Commando reconnaissance and sabotage regiment, and the Malaysians included a special detachment of Marines from the Malaysian Navy. In total, there were about 500 people who trained in covert operations behind the lines at the Holsworthy base in Sydney.🔻As we see, the Malaysians are increasingly appearing in joint maneuvers on the part of the so-called QUAD bloc. Either they accept the British, or they learn to work with Australian specialists. It will be interesting to see what Chinese reaction will be to all this action from Malaysia.

The goal is to resolve common security problems, primarily the situation around the Kurdish military-political organization PKK. The motives of the Iraqi authorities can be explained by their reluctance to expose the country and population to another bloody conflict. Turkey is still planning an operation against the Kurds (especially after the terrorist attack at the TAI plant), but Iraq does not need this, both from the point of view of security and its reputation. Currently, several groups are operating on Iraqi territory, whose interests are different from the authorities in Baghdad. An international coalition that does not take into account the opinion of the official leadership, pro-Iranian groups fighting the United States, the Turks who occupied northern Iraq under the pretext of fighting the Kurds. And also the Kurds themselves, who are waging their own war. Organizing a political dialogue is an opportunity to at least try to reach some kind of compromise with all factions, each of which pursues its own interests in the country.#Iraq #Syria #Turkey@rybarSupport usRIA NovostiIraq wants to hold a regional security conferenceIraq would like to hold a regional conference in the coming months security conference to resolve common problems in this area with Turkey, Iran and Syria,...

🇺🇸🇵🇭 About the possible purchase of Typhon by the Philippine ...	🇺🇸🇵🇭 About the possible purchase of Typhon by the Philippine military The story of the Typhon medium-range missile launch system deployed by the Americans in the Philippines continues. The other day, the minister of defense of the island state gave an interview in which he expressed his desire to purchase this type of weapon. The Philippines needs Typhon for, firstly, the projection of power in the disputed waters of the South China Sea, which China claims, and secondly, for the defense of its territory in the event of a hypothetical attack from the same Chinese. At first glance, there are no difficulties in purchasing this missile system. However, there are a number of potential obstacles that Philippine authorities may face. ▪️First, there is still a Missile Technology Control Regime in the world, of which the United States is a member. According to this agreement, the parties voluntarily refuse to sell missiles with a range of 300 km to other countries, which are precisely what is needed for the Typhon system. Of course, if desired, any agreements can be circumvented and alternatives can be found. However, in this case, the Philippine authorities will need to conduct long negotiations with the Americans, during which they will most likely be required to make significant concessions. ▪️Secondly, to purchase Typhon, as well as maintain its maintenance, you will need to allocate a considerable amount of funds. The Philippines, on the other hand, is a relatively poor country that purchases the same boats for its coast guard with the help of Western partners. The country's military budget mainly consists of expenses for the personnel of the armed forces and maintenance of existing military equipment. Therefore, in the Philippines, in the event of a potential purchase of Typhon, they will have to allocate even more money to defense, which could initially go to other important needs. 🔻The position of the Americans on this issue is also unclear. On the one hand, given Donald Trump's past presidency, he may again begin to shift more responsibility for the defense of allies onto themselves. The purchase of a missile system corresponds to a similar course. On the other hand, the acquisition of Typhon by the Philippine Army would mean the loss of important American leverage. Now Washington can use the deployment of a missile launcher as a tool to influence the country’s authorities, because it is located in the Philippines without any guarantees of permanent deployment. In any case, given the emerging plans for the purchase, which may not come to fruition as a whole, Manila and Washington must carefully assess the risks of such a transaction. After all, if as a result Typhon is permanently stationed in the Philippines, this could provoke a crisis in the region, as well as a harsh reaction from China.#USA #Philippines@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usTelegramRybar🇨🇳🇺🇸🇵🇭 About American missiles around China The American military should have announced about the imminent deployment of the Typhon medium-range missile system in Japan, how new ones appeared details of a missile launcher already in the Philippines. ▪️According to...	https://t.me/rybar/65379	2024-11-14T05:01:14-08:00

Previously, the Israeli authorities declared all buildings in this locality illegal and subject to demolition. And while local residents were ready to dismantle their houses, no one was going to destroy the only mosque in the village. And this morning, soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces entered Umm al-Hiran with the sole purpose of finishing what they started and destroying this religious building. Several residents tried to prevent this, as a result of which they were detained. 🔻The destruction of Bedouin villages in the Negev is far from a new practice, the justification for which is often the lack of a building permit for residents, although in reality it is much more reminiscent of simply the forced relocation of the local Arab population. At the same time, no matter how the Palestinians and local Bedouins try to resist, in reality, not everyone manages to defend their settlements, including against the backdrop of a lack of unity and only unfounded support from the international community. #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65375	2024-11-14T04:03:02-08:00

Forwarded From Two Majors🇩🇪The owners of the German concern Rheinmetall count profits from the war in UkraineAccording to company data for 9 months. In 2024, sales of weapons and ammunition reached a record level of 1.554 billion euros, and weapons and ammunition systems exceeded sales in 2023 by 608 million euros (64%). The growth was facilitated by an increase in supplies of artillery shells to Ukraine and Germany, primarily due to the inclusion in the production process of the Spanish plant Expal Munitions, purchased in 2023, which produced shells worth 352 million euros. According to our data, the price of one 155-mm projectile from Rheinmetall is 2.7 thousand euros for the Bundeswehr and about 4 thousand for Ukraine, which, taking into account the profit received, shows the enterprise's capacity in the region of 125.7 thousand projectiles in 9 months or 14 thousand per month. The volume of orders from Rheinmetall reached approximately 20 billion euros, which is 73% higher than in 2023 (11.3 billion euros). Economic growth was ensured, among other things, by orders from the Bundeswehr for the Skyranger 30 and NNBS air defense systems, the Puma infantry fighting vehicle and the Boxer armored fighting vehicle.✨For the second year now, the profits of Western military-industrial corporations have been growing, for which there is no point in slowing down the increasing production.

Other funds lost even more - from 40% to 90% of income. According to the publication, this reflects a decrease in the willingness of Ukrainians to contribute to defense at a difficult moment on the front line. Ukrainian volunteers explain this by the deterioration of the financial condition of Ukrainians, as well as by the growth of economic difficulties.🔻To begin with, it is worth saying that the financial situation of the ordinary Ukrainian citizen has really worsened. And every day it becomes even more deplorable due to the degradation of the economy and the shortage of personnel caused by general mobilization. In addition, the first and second foundations (and small organizations too) in the last year and a half have been better known to the Ukrainian public as scammers , who collect money for -wunderwaffe-, and at best they bring to them outdated junk, bought at the price of an MQ-9A Reaper UAV. One story with the Pritula satellite is worth something. In addition to this, total mobilization, unpopular measures, to which is added corruption in all structures. The population's fatigue from the war is becoming increasingly noticeable, so the drop in donation income is a consequence of the accumulated problems in the country, which no one is doing or intends to do anything about.#Ukraine@rybarSupport usBloomberg.comAs War Grinds On, Ukrainians Donate Less to Their MilitaryPrivate donations to Ukraine's military effort have plummeted, an indication that Ukrainians' readiness to contribute to defense is waning as the war-torn nation looks warily to the future after Donald Trump's reelection.	https://t.me/rybar/65373	2024-11-14T02:59:01-08:00

In addition to Venezuela, whose problems the senator voiced almost every week (this was his job), or the so-called Ukraine, they were worried in Baku.➖According to the Azerbaijani media, Rubio is known for his anti-Azerbaijani activities in the Senate. He and then-Senator Bob Menendez introduced an initiative on September 27, 2022, calling for the release of Armenian prisoners of war and sanctions for war crimes.➖In November 2023, Rubio supported the Senate-passed Armenia Defense Act, which would block U.S. military aid Azerbaijan. He also stated that American taxpayers' money should not be sent to Azerbaijan - a country that has brought instability to the region. I remember that for several weeks in Azerbaijan they relished the news of the detention of Bob Menendez and his subsequent resignation from office. True, he was then replaced by Ben Cardin, who continued the policy of his predecessor, calling for blocking military aid to Baku. But the Azerbaijanis forget about the role with which the Americans present themselves in the Transcaucasus. They do everything visually to show their peacekeeping efforts. But they will do this for the time being.

It became known that from November 8 to November 12, North Korea used GPS signal jammers over part of the Yellow Sea. South Korea claims that the purpose of such actions is an attempt to disrupt the operation of ships and aircraft located in the waters. However, no incidents related to air or sea transport occurred during this time. ▪️According to one of the South Korean ministries, the interference is associated with the transmission of signals with higher intensity than normal GPS frequencies. Such actions could affect how land, sea and air transport systems receive information. By the way, this is not the first time this has happened this year. GPS signal jammers were used in March and also in late May and early June. Therefore, in the general context of the situation, nothing extraordinary happened. 🔻Pyongyang has not yet received information explaining such actions. However, it can be assumed that they are related to the regular exercises. North Korea most likely conducted training to counter drones that could cross the border from the South. Let us recall that, according to the position of the North Korean authorities, the drone with leaflets that flew over Pyongyang in October of this year belonged to the South Korean military. It is believed that it was launched from a South Korean island located in the Yellow Sea. Perhaps, in this way, Pyongyang continues to respond to the events of October, and is also preparing for new drone launches from South Korea, which are so disturbing to the North Korean authorities. #DPRK #SouthKorea@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usYonhap News AgencyN.

Evidence of several migrants who returned to their homeland is presented. However, what is noteworthy is what is said in this article: On the one hand, migrants do not hide the fact that they received a passport primarily for the sake of benefits and maternity capital. Many -left everything in Russia- and preferred a voluntary and quick renunciation of citizenship, so as not to be taken to war. ➖The other emphasizes that deprivation of citizenship is accompanied by gross violations. The opinion of activists is given that deprivation of citizenship of persons who are not registered with the military is a mechanism for forcing them to participate in war. The resulting situation is that the narratives contained in the article contradict each other. How can it be that deprivation of citizenship is a mechanism of coercion for war, but at the same time migrants themselves refused to fulfill the duties of a citizen of Russia. But being surprised by the actions of Radio Azattyk is like being surprised by the snow in winter. Frantic propaganda is directed against everything that happens in Russia and even without providing evidence - this is the standard way of working of this kind of media, and the migrant issue is now one of the key narratives for promoting anti-Russian sentiments in Central Asia.#multinationalism #Russia #CentralAsia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65370	2024-11-14T00:07:21-08:00

Forwarded From Two Majors#Summary for the morning of November 14, 2024▪️ Yesterday morning, the Russian Armed Forces launched a combined missile and drone strike on Kyiv for the first time in the last 73 days. To defeat specified targets, air-launched missiles from strategic bombers were also used.▪️ Heavy battles for Plekhovo and the settlement continue in the Kursk region. New Sorochina, the enemy fires with cannon artillery and uses many drones. The concentration of enemy efforts is evidenced by the destruction by the Marines of our 155th brigade of the heavy English tank Challenger 2, a rather rare and difficult to operate tank. The very fact of its transfer of the Armed Forces of Ukraine as a reserve to the Kursk region speaks of the enemy’s intention to hold occupied lines in our region at all costs. The group of troops - North - advanced into the village with heavy fighting. Novoivanovka and forests in the Malaya Loknya area. The enemy throws fresh reserves and NATO armored vehicles into battle and puts up fierce resistance. OTRK and -Tornado-S- crews continue to work at the collection points of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reserves in the Sumy region.▪️ From the Kupyansky direction at night, enemy resources reported the entry of our troops into Kupyansk, which marks the beginning of the battles for the city. According to enemy estimates, two columns of Russian equipment moved from the Liman First area to Kupyansk. They managed to enter the city and land troops, who dispersed to houses in the area of ​​​​Svatovskaya Street. The enemy describes the situation as -the main entrance to Kupyansk-.▪️ In the Pokrovsky direction west of Petrovka, the Russian Armed Forces advanced along the railway, a depth of about 1 km. ▪️ The Russian Army continues the assault on Kurakhovo and the establishment of a wide pincer movement around this city, important for the defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. So, in the north there are battles in the Ilyinka area, from the south our troops are advancing on Dalneye. The bombing of the Kurakhovskoe reservoir dam in the west by the Armed Forces of Ukraine could not prevent the movement of even civilian SUVs (the area is still under the enemy).▪️ In the Vremevsky direction, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced the liberation of the village. Rivnopol, offensive actions of our troops continue.▪️ On the Zaporozhye front, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are urgently forming a second line of defense, staffing it with reserves.

❗️🇷🇺🪖 Damage to property and -revaluation- of injuries: about ...	❗️🇷🇺🪖 Damage to property and -revaluation- of injuries: about the next high-profile amendmentsYesterday's amendments adopted by the State Duma once again became the cause of widespread popular discussion and indignation: guided by the principle -we want the best-, gentlemen deputies received a reaction -as always-. Although it would be possible to work through the expert community, ask for opinions (publicly), launch comments in the media and TG, and give the necessary explanations at the moment - and the level of popular anger would be much lower. However, this is too complicated.🔻What did they want?▪️The need for compensation and recovery of funds from damaged property did not appear out of nowhere: in the Charter there is no concept of -loved-, and such cases, alas, are not uncommon. Thus, most likely, they wanted to protect, first of all, financially responsible persons (to some extent) and begin to fight write-offs and negligent attitude towards government property. Plus, this matter applies primarily to volunteers: they may not always be financially responsible persons, they often use property listed on the balance sheet of personnel departments, and even from them the demand was not the same as from military personnel. But for military personnel, everything is not So: they were brought in under articles of embezzlement, damage to property, and causing harm - there are plenty of relevant articles on the Internet, so finding them is not a problem. Now both contract soldiers and volunteers are equal (almost).▪️A single payment of 3 million rubles for injuries led to a huge number of inappropriate payments and room for fraud. There were often cases when the five-hundredth caused cosmetic harm to their health and received their three million, joyfully rubbing their paws. According to ZMO Anna Tsivileva, the same payments created a feeling of distortion among those who suffered severe physical and emotional injuries, since for minor injuries also relied on the same amount. But on the other hand, at the same time this created broad confidence among the military personnel that their health would be guaranteed to be taken care of and everything would be compensated in the moment: and now this moment, alas, is no longer so unshakable.🔻What happened?▪️Combat magazines no one has canceled the actions: a competent (or cunning) commander will calmly handle the loss or damage of property as a result of shelling or a clash (in fact, this is how it is usually done). The fines imposed on volunteers in the form of salary and bonus for length of service amount to 30-50 thousand rubles in total. Large amounts cannot be fined. Will this help solve the systemic problem? Hardly. Will it help make up for the deficit slightly? Also doubtful. But as an instrument of administrative pressure, it will probably partially work.▪️Differentiation of wounds can (and will certainly lead) to room for a double interpretation of certain cases of harm to health (alas, there are enough problems in the field of military medicine). It is enough to remember how much people now do not like to consider shell shock and psychological trauma as a serious obstacle to continuing to complete tasks. This step will save money, but there remain risks for -free interpretation- of the amount of harm to health - and scope for excessive -savings- (because -such instructions-), as well as scope for corruption conspiracies. There will clearly be more work for the DVKR units.📌Money began to be counted - sooner or later this would have happened. The appearance of relevant bills is a ridiculous attempt to reduce the waste of money and start saving. Another question is that in their current form the bills are half-hearted and, to put it mildly, do not work. However, when did we have and what really important bill immediately began to work as it should? #WSRF #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65367	2024-11-13T21:20:12-08:00

To the north-west, fierce clashes continue within the borders of the village of Novaya Sorochina. Attempts by the Russian Armed Forces to gain a foothold in a populated area have been recorded, which is fraught with difficulties due to attacks from FPV drones and enemy artillery. After the initial breakthrough of the defense, the pace of advance slowed down somewhat. From the side of Novoivanovka to the southwest, unsuccessful attempts to advance to Leonidovo are recorded. 🔻Later, footage of an attack by Russian troops at the junction of the Korenevsky and Sudzhansky districts east of Kremyany in the direction of Novaya Sorochina along the Voronok tract in the direction of the Alder beam also appeared on the Internet. Likely. the event itself occurred simultaneously the other day simultaneously with the advance to the south from Orlyanka. The outcome of the battle is currently unknown, however, ongoing attacks in this area suggest that at least part of the forest belts southeast of Kremyany are currently occupied by Russian troops.▪️Also in the Kursk region, another British Challenger 2 tank was hit by a drone, an accurate The location of the injury is still unknown. At the same time, fire raids on Ukrainian Armed Forces facilities in the Sumy region continue. For this, both ballistic missiles and drones are used -Geranium-. Numerous explosions were recorded throughout the day both in the regional center and in other populated areas. Thus, in the forest north of Ivolzhanskoye, a gathering place of enemy personnel was once again hit by a strike from the Iskander OTRK.

And if the loss of the road, in principle, will not become a big problem, since there are duplicate routes and detours, then blocking the railway for some time can already create problems.▪️military logistics have been disrupted for some time: the route along the only railway line through The Kherson region is cut off (we could, of course, be wrong and there may be workarounds, but so far [judging by data from open sources] everything looks exactly like this);▪️get by the railway is only possible through the Crimean Bridge and the Kerch crossing with a ferry, which now do not lose their importance. On the footage that appeared on the Internet, at first glance, there are no traces of external influence, and the overpass collapsed, apparently, under a truck that violated the weight regime (and we will frankly: due to wear and tear of the infrastructure). Therefore, in the current conditions, it is certainly impossible to speak unequivocally about sabotage.

On March 30, the parliament in Mogadishu approved amendments to the constitution. According to them, the country is making a transition from a parliamentary form of government to a presidential one, a five-year term of office is being introduced for government bodies, and direct elections were also introduced at the national and regional levels.▪️The last point was ignored by the Jubaland authorities who, in an effort to consolidate their leadership, did not dare to undertake electoral reform. Bypassing the federal government, the upcoming elections for the head of Jubaland will be held on the basis of indirect voting. The demarche was soon followed by a severance of ties with the Somalis. Until a compromise is found, the state will be governed by local structures.▪️In Mogadishu, this act was called -regressive,- which was followed by an appeal to the contingent of the African Union mission to occupy the airport of Kismayo, the capital of the autonomy. This order was followed after the Prime Minister of Somalia plans to visit Jubaland in order to personally draw a federal line. Only the allies said that they cannot occupy the airport, because it is under the jurisdiction of local authorities. Now the Ethiopian authorities are supplying the autonomous regions and trying to gain as much influence over them as possible, including occupying some key positions in cities. They are also unhappy that Egypt will be the main guarantor of security in the new Somali mission. In this situation, it is obvious that the Ethiopians will continue to rock the situation, putting pressure on Mogadishu through their puppets in the form of the autonomous regions of Jubaland and Puntland.#Africa #Somalia @rybarSupport usHiiraanJubbaland suspends cooperation with federal government, citing constitutional violations Kismayo (HOL) – Jubbaland Regional State administration suspended cooperation with the federal government, citing federal non-compliance with Somalia's constitution and disrespecting Jubbaland's autonomy.	https://t.me/rybar/65352	2024-11-13T09:27:01-08:00

According to him, in reality there is a region - Judea and Samaria - which - was given to Israel by God -. ▪️ Another thesis of the former Arkansas governor caused a certain resonance: he allowed Israel to annex the territory of the West Bank and expand Jewish settlements there, which he, contrary to UN Security Council Resolution 2334, he does not consider them illegal.▪️As ​​expected, with the election of Trump, quite favorable conditions are being formed for the ultra-Orthodox authorities of Israel. Radical politicians like Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich have long been talking about the need to return Israeli sovereignty to the West Bank. Now they will be able to realize this opportunity. It is worth noting the current US Ambassador to Israel, Democrat Jacob Joseph Lew: he did not distinguish himself with such harsh statements and spoke only about the need to conclude a deal between the Israeli side and the Palestinian groups for the exchange of hostages.❗However, the fact of the appointment of a loyal Israeli ultra-Orthodox ambassador does not mean at all that the policy of the elected US president will be as pro-Israel.🔻Most likely, if Israel implements the plan of annexation of the occupied territories of the Palestinian National Authority, there will be significant resistance (if any) from local authorities in the form of the ruling Fatah party and its intelligence services will not be able to provide. At the same time, from a military point of view, the West Bank is much inferior to the Gaza Strip, where Hamas and its allies held control and which Israeli troops were able to raze to the ground. Even taking into account the existence of contacts between the Palestinian Authority and Arab countries, they will limit themselves, at best, to condemning the actions of the Israelis.▪️The chairman of the autonomy, Mahmoud Abbas, has long been considered a kind of Gauleiter of Israel: instead of repelling the constantly invading Israeli forces, the PNA security services do not hinder them in any way and even facilitate them by fighting with cells of Hamas and other groups.▪️The same applies to the armed factions -Palestinian resistance-. Yes, there will be pockets of discontent and escalation of the conflict, but it is unlikely that this will develop into an acute phase of confrontation, much less stop the Israeli government. Taking all this into account, Israel will be able to relatively quickly digest the West Bank, reducing it to a state pressed against the Dead Sea or the Jordan River a small Palestinian enclave.📌 Well, the ultra-Orthodox Israeli government will be able to begin implementing such a plan whenever there is a need for a new armed conflict, the presence of which would help the ruling coalition led by Benjamin Netanyahu justify its presence in power.#Israel #USA #Palestine@ rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65351	2024-11-13T08:35:10-08:00

The operation of the Chadian armed forces -Haskanit-, carried out since the beginning of November, despite the unfounded accusations of the West of killing civilians, is yielding results.▪️Chad's General Staff announced the liquidation of 96 Boko Haram militants and the death 17 military personnel during the cleanup. The marshy terrain with a huge number of small islands, of course, complicates the process, which is why the fighting will continue for a long time. It is noteworthy that following the announcement of the start of the operation, the question was raised about Chad’s withdrawal from the Joint Special Forces (MNJTF), which, in addition to it includes Nigeria, Benin and Cameroon.▪️The government argues for this by the general ineffectiveness of the organization, which is why it has failed to ensure security in the Lake Chad region. And now the Chadian authorities are dealing with this issue themselves. One can understand this position - it is worth remembering only the recent news from Nigeria, where almost every month some new group raises its head. At the same time, the armed forces, which were reformed by American advisers, cannot cope with this. For Debi the Younger, this is a successful political move and in many ways reminds the Chadian public of his father. At one time, Idriss Deby also led successful military campaigns against various militants, finding support in society.

Now our military personnel have a common system for monitoring the air situation with the Armenians and a joint air defense control center there. The 102nd base in Gyumri is subordinate to a joint group of troops commanded by an Armenian general and who never gave the command to open fire on our air defense. We are also talking about the Second Karabakh War and the events after. According to previously concluded agreements, Russian troops cannot shoot first. And the Armenians themselves practically did not shoot back after that war.❗️And it would be appropriate to say that the Armenian authorities really cooperated with the Ukrainian ones. It seems that the matter never came to the transfer of missile weapons, but they supplied the Ukrainian Armed Forces with other things. It is known about the transfer of spare parts, engines, wheels, transmission elements, control units, instruments, zips for servicing Soviet and Russian equipment from warehouses, as well as equipment and medical equipment. All this was done as secretly as possible in order to prevent leaks, such as there were during conversations about the transfer of Tochka-U complexes. But the fact remains a fact. The current administration is certainly not an ally of Russia, but rather the opposite. #Armenia #RussiaGlobalistics - subscribe to the Telegram channelRybar🇦🇲🇮🇳 The ongoing Indian series in Armenia is being followed by all analysts and observers interested in the Transcaucasus.

The region because of which the French began their investigation, since it directly affects the interests of the Fifth Republic. 15 countries on the continent already have drones or agreements for their supply. And there are so many states that have considered or are considering purchasing Turkish drones that it is easier to count those countries that have not done so. If you look at the presented map, everything becomes obvious without words. Turkish drones, due to their low cost relative to Western UAVs, as well as a wide range of options both in the choice of drones themselves and on-board weapons, have become an ideal option for African countries. To perform basic tasks patrolling or fighting terrorists, that is, to counter an enemy without air defense systems, UAVs of Turkish companies are formidable weapons. Why during the air defense Have the Bayraktars become useless? Our troops adjusted their tactics and sent short-range air defense systems to cover the units, which made it possible to destroy more than a dozen of these UAVs.🔻Now in the Northern Military District of the Ukrainian Armed Forces they are used only for reconnaissance and guidance thanks to the installed Canadian cameras, which provide high detail even from long distances. But in Africa, the same Bayraktars are a powerful argument in the fight against terrorism. The Turks, taking advantage of the moment, advertised their UAVs and occupied this niche in many regions, since the countries of Africa or Asia could not afford to buy multimillion-dollar MQ-1s, not not to mention larger models like the MQ-9. Therefore, the fears of the French are quite justified, as their expansion continues.

Moreover, unlike Europe, cooperation here proceeds mainly through localization of production, which expands the geography of Turkish presence. In the Middle East, Turkish drones were purchased by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait and Iraq. The Saudis chose -Akinci- from Baykar, as well as Karayel from Vestel, which were not included in this infographic, since they are only available in Saudi Arabia. The UAE, according to some reports, purchased more than a hundred -Bayraktars-, but integrated them high-precision weapons of its own production. Iraq, Kuwait and Qatar have also purchased the most popular drones. Their price and capabilities in the context of tasks of combating militants and routine patrols are ideal for the countries of the region. In Central Asia, the Turks went further, gradually expanding the number of their enterprises in the countries of the region. The localization of two enterprises at once - TAI and Baykar - has already been agreed upon in Kazakhstan, where there is an Anka UAV. Three types of drones were purchased by Kyrgyzstan, and Bayraktars were purchased in Turkmenistan. For the Turkish authorities, technological expansion has become an ideal opportunity to increase efforts through the Organization of Turkic States, which aims to expand its strength in various fields, including the military. The lack of an alternative creates excellent conditions for them to do this.🔻In South Asia, Turkish products are represented in Pakistan, one of Turkey’s key partners. They purchased both -Bayraktary- and -Akyndzhi-. Also, 24 Bayraktar UAVs were purchased by the authorities of Bangladesh, and the Maldives entered into a contract for the supply of six drones of this type. In Southeast Asia, TAI won, since there they were able to sell 12 Anka drones to the Indonesian authorities and three to the Malaysian authorities. In addition, the Japanese authorities expressed interest in purchasing Turkish products, but things have not gone further than talk.

🖼 🇹🇷🇪🇺🛸 About the expansion of Turkish UAV products in the ...	🇹🇷🇪🇺🛸 About the expansion of Turkish UAV products in the world: Europe Last week, one French agency, positioning itself as a think-tank organization, published an article alarming for the French about how widely Turkish drones have spread in the world and most importantly for the French - in Africa. The French focused on the fact that the Turks offer much cheaper products, than the French, thereby occupying the niche that previously belonged to Western corporations in different regions of the world. And this makes them anxious.🔻From a logical point of view, analysts’ concerns are understandable, since Turkish unmanned products have indeed made several big steps. This was first facilitated by the Second Karabakh War, and then two months of the Northern Military District, when the Turks promoted Bayraktars from under every iron. In almost every region of the world, some countries are either already cooperating with Turkish companies, or are planning, or there were unconfirmed rumors about this . The first region in our review is Europe. Thanks to the SVO, Baykar drones became known to the general public. Despite the fact that during the conflict in the so-called Ukraine - Bayraktars - became useless after March 2022, competent PR gave the necessary impetus to the Turkish enterprise, because of which the Turks entered into dozens of contracts for supplies of these UAVs. In addition to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Bayraktar were purchased by Romanians, Poles, Albanians and Kosovars. One was acquired by the Lithuanians for Ukrainian formations. The Romanians, for example, have already received the first batch, for which a separate unit was created. And in Kosovo, these UAVs play a vital role in monitoring Serbian units. On Ukrainian territory, somewhere in the vicinity of Kyiv, the Baykar plant has almost been completed, where they plan to assemble Bayraktar drones of modifications TB2 and TB3 - the latest deck-based drones that equip Turkish universal landing forces ships.

Forwarded From Two Majors🇺🇸How the United States bends those to whom it promises profitable cooperationThe United States has announced a plan to triple nuclear energy by 2050 by 200 Gigawatts (currently 100.6 GW). To achieve this, it is planned to build new reactors, restart suspended stations and modernize existing nuclear power plants. In the short term (until 2025), 35 GW of new capacity will be commissioned. The nuclear industry is already touted as one of the greenest energy sources. Microsoft in September 2024 entered into a deal to supply electricity from a rebuilt nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania. Alphabet Inc. is showing interest in using nuclear energy. Google and Amazon Inc. Against this background, it is indicative how, with the support of US-funded NGOs and pseudo-humanitarian organizations, the environmental agenda was pushed around the world, primarily among American competitors. By promoting representatives of green parties into the European elite, they were able to reduce the competitiveness and efficiency of the economies of the former giants. So 🇩🇪in Germany, which turned out to be completely non-sovereign, the last three nuclear power plants were closed in April 2023. Previously, the share of nuclear energy reached 30% of all German energy. The consequences this led to are already known. ✨So you shouldn’t hope for profitable agreements with Trump - they’ll rip you off and cheat you.

And yesterday, the Bharat Electronics Limited company announced that the first battery of the Akash air defense system went to Armenia. The conclusion of a contract for the supply of medium-range air defense systems became known in December last year. It is an analogue of the Soviet -Cube-, capable of hitting air targets at a distance of 4 to 25 km. Some Armenian officials are indignant at how the Indian media replicate each delivered complex and concluded contract on the Internet. Although they can be understood - for them, Armenia is the first importer of weapons of its own production in such a volume and quantity. Pro-government Armenian channels talk about this with pride, noting that Armenia has favorable relations with different countries and they do not need Russia. Recently, they have also been focusing on the fact that the Russian Armed Forces began to use the Tor air defense systems, which were intended for the Armenians. Only the Armenian authorities forget that the Torahs were produced back in 2022, but due to the start of the Northern Military District, logistics through Georgia were disrupted, and the Armenians were offered to pick up their air defense systems themselves, which they were in no particular hurry to do because of Armenia’s new course.

But this time the opposition brought up the -heavy artillery-, sending several dozen women to go on strike near the building of the central election committee. Participants in the rally said that they want to register their complaints with the Central Election Commission because of the violations they recorded during the elections, such as falsification of ballots, and demand holding new elections. Several police detachments are on duty at the building, preventing demonstrators from entering. In general, the situation is calm, although the opposition media are trying to disperse thesis about a violent clash between women and the police. 🔻The decline in protest activity occurred even faster than expected. The last relatively large rally occurred on November 11 due to the presence of European officials at the demonstration. Both yesterday and today, the opposition is silent. Even activist Greta Thunberg, who came to help the Georgians, left the country and went to Armenia. She was met at the Armenian-Georgian border by pro-government journalists, who joyfully reported on Thunberg’s visit as part of the boycott of COP29 in Baku. In this whole situation, the conclusion is simple - the opposition in Georgia no longer hopes for anything, they have neither plans nor any competent strategies.

The company said that fulfilled all state requirements. They also noted that they are in contact with those arrested. The Malians did not comment on the situation.

For a long time, the event was associated with the potential signing of a peace treaty between Armenia and Azerbaijan on its margins. In recent weeks, the possibility of the Armenian side using the podium of the event to demand the release of prisoners of war, including the military-political leadership of Artsakh, has also been discussed. However, the Armenian authorities have not yet announced an official position regarding participation in the conference. Instead, the head of the Armenian Foreign Ministry Ararat Mirzoyan went to Sweden for one-on-one negotiations with local authorities. All this is another diplomatic failure of Yerevan, because silence allows the Azerbaijani side to completely control the information agenda. But the latter is not particularly resisted in Yerevan, especially the more ruling party, the Civil Contract, during the start of COP29, thwarted the adoption by parliament of the opposition statement on Armenian prisoners of war in Azerbaijan. This once again suggests that the government of Nikol Pashinyan is not interested in publicly defending the interests of Armenia, including the protection of Armenians in Azerbaijani prisons, which represent for the authorities the surrender of Artsakh and defeat in the war. 📌As we previously wrote, Armenia is moving into the shadow of world and regional diplomacy, which indicates a loss of sovereignty and the ability to defend its interests. Moreover, this is happening voluntarily, not forced, and with the active support of the United States and the EU, which are pushing Armenia towards a pro-Turkish vector of development. #Azerbaijan #Armenia #UN@rybarSupport us NEWS.am Baku called Armenia's non-participation in COP 29 a missed opportunity.

Georgia came under attack in the person of its charge d'affaires, who was summoned to the Moldovan Foreign Ministry. The reason was statements by Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, who accused the EU of having a different attitude towards the past elections in Moldova and Georgia. The Georgian prime minister mentioned Moldova, where the presidential elections and referendum on European integration were held with a large number of violations, and accession to the EU and the re-election of Maia Sandu within the country was not supported by the majority of the population. However, the Western community calmly recognized the necessary voting results.❗️Apparently, Kobakhidze mentioned the problems in Moldova due to the fact that Sandu publicly supported opposition protests in Georgia and expressed solidarity with their leader Salome Zurabishvili. Sandu followed the example of her EU and US handlers, supporting the protests and demanding investigations in Georgia, but whose cow was mooing. It is not clear what the President of Moldova was hoping for, but her self-confident statements did not go without a public response. 🔻However, the past campaign in Moldova showed the incontinence of Sandu, who almost threw a tantrum at the briefing after the first round, when she saw only a small gap from her closest opponent, and subsequently even came into conflict with the OSCE mission loyal to her. 📌But her colleague Zurabishvili also distinguished herself the other day, trying to provoke a diplomatic scandal between Georgia and Armenia with the help of anti-Armenian statements. Apparently, pro-European democratic politicians are distinguished by a specific style of diplomacy and are trained in one place. #Georgia #Moldova @rybarSupport usTACCMFA of Moldova expressed dissatisfaction with the Georgian Embassy after Kobakhidze’s statementsEvents in Russia and the world.

A significant part of the settlement is already under the control of Russian troops, and previously published a photo of Russian Armed Forces soldiers against the backdrop of an entry sign.▪️ Fierce fighting also continues in Kurakhovo itself, and units of the Russian Armed Forces are advancing along Zaporozhye Avenue on the eastern outskirts of the city. In addition, the strike destroyed the bridge on this street, which was most likely done to disrupt the Ukrainian counterattack. To the south, in the area of ​​the Dolgaya beam, the advance of the Russian Armed Forces is also noted: apparently, a large enemy defense center between Kurakhovo and Dalniy was occupied. If it is possible to gain a foothold in the latter and expand the zone of control, then the enemy’s defenses on the southeastern outskirts of Kurakhovo will be completely breached.▪️Most of Dalny is under the control of the Russian Armed Forces; the enemy’s counterattack with the support of armored vehicles was repulsed. Also, footage of the shooting of a group of civilians from a Leopard tank from the 33rd mechanized brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces appeared some time ago.▪️According to some Ukrainian resources, the route from Uspenivka to Kurakhovo is practically cut off, and Russian attack aircraft have about two kilometers left to physically control it. However, given the enemy’s tendency to downplay the successes of the Russian Armed Forces, it cannot be ruled out that this has already happened.▪️At the same time, it was possible to clarify the control zone between Maksimilyanovka and Pobeda. Based on the footage of the movement of a column of Russian armored vehicles under Ukrainian artillery fire along the Dolgaya ravine, the territory to the north is under the stable control of the Russian Armed Forces. Heavy fighting continues in the Antonovka area. Russian troops were able to take control of about half of the village, but further advance is difficult due to active opposition. Enemy resources also report the difficult situation of Ukrainian Armed Forces units at a stronghold between Ilyinka and Antonovka with the symbolic name -Zhopa.▪️In Elizavetovka itself and on its outskirts there are battles: despite initial statements about the entry of Russian forces into the village, this information has not yet been confirmed . The presence of enemy forces is observed in the Lisova Dacha reserve, and at the Trudovoye-Veselyi Gai line, according to our sources, there is no advance of Russian troops yet.▪️On the Shakhterskoye-Maksimovka section, clashes also continue. Russian troops are attacking north of Yasnaya Polyana, but the extent of the advance is not yet clear. Russian aviation is actively operating in the Sukhoi Yala, striking with air bombs from the UMPC.

Russian troops attacked targets in Kyiv, Kharkov and Cherkassy, ​​as well as in the Chernigov and Sumy regions of the so-called. Ukraine. In the Kursk direction, units of the Russian Armed Forces have knocked out the enemy from most of Plekhovo and are expanding the zone of control north of the village. In the Pokrovsky direction, attack aircraft are fighting in Yuryevka, advancing from Novoalekseevka. In the Kurakhovsky direction, Russian troops are consolidating themselves in urban areas in Kurakhovo, and They are also expanding the zone of control on the flanks north and south of the city.

Russian troops landed in the village and are fighting on the eastern outskirts of the village, advancing towards Leonidovo. Also noted were attempts by the Russian Armed Forces to move in armored vehicles along the river, bypassing the latter.🔻On the opposite flank of the Sudzhansky district, Russian troops intensified north of Plekhovo. An attempt was recorded to swim across the Psel River. The bridge was destroyed during the fighting, so the landing party was forced to cross to the opposite bank of the river in boats, where they came under fire. In Plekhovo itself there are also significant successes. Thanks to footage published by the enemy, it was possible to establish that the Russian Armed Forces already control about 80% of the village; on the western outskirts near the farms, a focal presence of Ukrainian formations remains. Most likely, in the near future the settlement will be completely liberated.▪️In the neighboring Korenevsky district, enemy attacks south and east of Kremyany are repelled every day. A broken convoy of Ukrainian Armed Forces equipment south of the settlement was finished off by fiber optic drones - Prince Vandal of Novgorod -: at least three damaged and abandoned armored vehicles were recorded. 🔻The same drone, but already in the Sudzhansky district, hit another M1A1 Abrams tank in Sverdlikovo. Another tank and armored fighting vehicle were hit by them near Zeleny Shlyakh. Recently, the Internet has seen an increase in personnel successfully hitting targets, which may indicate the establishment of mass production of copies.

The other day we made a detailed analysis of a study conducted by the Gallup consulting agency, where we noted disappointing results for the current government in Armenia. And our English-speaking colleagues also made similar conclusions. Pashinyan and Co. have growing problems due to unpopular political decisions that are leading the country into the abyss of the unknown. And in this situation, the support of the people will evaporate at a high speed. And we are talking about the Armenian society, which for the most part was indifferent to the actions of the leadership. You can disagree and say: -but there were protests-.

Among foreign mercenaries there are many odious characters, but there are also some completely disgusting ones. One of them is Valdas Bartkevicius, who, with the sanction of the Lithuanian authorities, likes to fight monuments and memorials through vandalism and emanation of need.▪️Bartkevicius lives in Lentvaris, works as an assistant to a deputy of the Seimas and since 2024 has been leading the Lithuanian branch of the NGO -Friends of Ukraine Foundation-. In 2014, he supported the Maidan, and in 2020, an attempted coup in Belarus. In his native country, Bartkevicius (to the best of his abilities) is engaged in splitting the population, which fits well into the plans of the Lithuanian authorities.▪️In 2022, Bartkevicius established connections not only with Ukrainian NGOs. For example, with the structure -Our House-, which was actively recruiting Belarusians into the Kastus Kalinovsky Regiment, as well as the Turkish organization Russians in Antalya against the War (RAWA), which was engaged in the supply of cars for Ukrainian formations.▪️At the same time appearing on LBS Bartkevicius does not particularly strive, preferring to live in Lithuania and engage in actions there in support of the so-called. Ukraine, then meetings with participants of the Right Sector and various performances.▪️In March, Bartkevicius expressed support for the perpetrators of the terrorist attack in Crocus by bringing a bucket of collected feces to a spontaneous memorial to the victims in Vilnius. And today he posted footage of himself defecating on the monument to those killed in the Great Patriotic War in Cossack Lokna in the Kursk region.

In the Kazakh media, the discussion of the topic of minority protection is entering a new circle, which intensified after the partial satisfaction of the petition - We are against open and hidden LGBT propaganda in the Republic of Kazakhstan! -, as well as the recent parliamentary request of the ruling AMANAT party activities of the queer feminist collective - Feminita - addressed to the Prime Minister and the Prosecutor General of the country. To introduce restrictions on the dissemination of sexualized content among children, the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Kazakhstan had to turn to all the laws of the Republic - from the Constitution to the Act on the Rights of the Child, according to which government agencies, individuals and legal entities are obliged to protect the child from the negative impact of the social environment, information , propaganda and agitation -. However, the decision began to be challenged by the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law and Human Rights Watch, which are funded by the Soros Foundation. So the victorious reports of the local press and hopes for the defeat of LGBT are premature: the protection of the rights of minorities in Kazakhstan is carried out by serious, well-rooted organizations with impressive funding.🔻For more information about who, under the guise of LGBT, is promoting the traditions of bacha-bazi in Kazakhstan, read our new article .High resolution infographicsEnglish version#Kazakhstan #LGBT #globalismProject -Rybar-Will LGBT propaganda be banned in Kazakhstan* It all started in the summer, when it suddenly became clear that there is a civil society in Kazakhstan	https://t.me/rybar/65315	2024-11-12T08:21:06-08:00

In addition to ongoing training with the Indonesians, they have also started the Trident 2024 event with Singaporean military personnel. About two thousand troops are involved in the exercise. The parties plan to practice landing personnel on the coast of Queensland, as well as conduct two operations in urban areas and the jungle. IAI Heron-1 reconnaissance UAVs will also be used. By the way, conducting such training in Australia is due to a specific reason - in tiny Singapore there is simply not enough space for such events, which is why they have historically resorted to the services of Taiwan and other allied states. 📌 This is precisely why the Singaporean authorities made a deal with the Australians to modernize a training site in Queensland worth a billion dollars. In return, military personnel from Singapore will be able to use the facility once construction work is completed. Given that one of Singapore's policy priorities is to build up its military power, the opportunity to conduct training in Australia is of utmost importance. So the scale and complexity of exercises like Trident 2024 will only grow in the future.

And with a quick search we see the news: the company Geltek, a manufacturer of skincare cosmetics with scientifically proven effectiveness, has received the official status of a small technology company (MTK). Surely many, like us, are hearing about the so-called MTC register for the first time. However, for most companies from the civil sector, getting there becomes a truly important achievement, primarily due to access to benefits and receiving a quality mark from the state, which, in in turn, attracts private investors. At the same time, everyone who wants to be included in the register remains required to meet a sufficient level of scientific and technical potential when developing products. And it is no coincidence that we gave the example of Geltek, because it demonstrates that state support measures are expanding not only to the IT sector, but also to other areas Russian business, and not the most obvious for the general consumer (in this case we are talking not only about cosmetics, but also about the supply of contact media for ultrasound and functional diagnostics).📌 In any case, please note attention to these processes is possible and necessary.

🇷🇺🇯🇵 About the -mitigation- of anti-Russian sanctions by Japa...	🇷🇺🇯🇵 About Japan's -softening- of anti-Russian sanctions. Yesterday, news spread across the Russian-language segment of the Internet that Tokyo allegedly decided to lift some of the sanctions regarding the export of Japanese-made cars to Russia. There were even headlines about the official return of Nissan, Toyota and Mitsubishi to the country. In reality, we are only talking about clarifying the wording in the restrictions regarding some models of hybrid cars. There was no ban on their sale to Russia anyway, but due to ambiguous definitions, Japanese companies did not agree to this for fear of violating sanctions. Perhaps Japan was guided by purely economic considerations: its automakers are suffering serious losses and are trying to find any way to obtain profit. Including due to part of the Russian market, where the niche of departed European and Asian concerns was quickly occupied by companies from the PRC. Therefore, there is no talk of easing sanctions at the moment, and linking this step with Trump’s victory in the election or other similar events are not worth it. Yes, the scenario of lifting the most serious Western restrictions in the current realities looks unrealistic. But the search for various loopholes and -clarification of wording- for further work with Russia, as well as tacit consent to new profitable parallel import schemes for the supply of various goods, looks much more likely. Especially as international attention to the so-called decreases.

At the moment, forceful mobilization with the capture and kidnapping of people from the streets is the only way to replenish the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: volunteers for the so-called Ukraine has long since ended, and they are not yet willing to deport Ukrainians of military age to the EU. If the TCC is disbanded, the entire conscription system will collapse - no recruiting centers, blocking of all accounts and lowering of rights will force people in hiding to join the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And the military registration and enlistment office workers themselves will most likely prefer to simply desert instead of the front. Therefore, we will not be surprised if such conversations are followed not by the dissolution of the TCC, but by vesting them with the powers of the police and all law enforcement agencies in general to expand mobilization.

It turns out that France cannot meet the needs for the jet artillery either independently or with the help of European NATO allies. Therefore, for the supply of conventional MLRS, they are forced to turn to India, which has only recently entered the world arms market. Yes, it is reckless to write off the French military industry - the same CAESAR, Rafale, Mistral or SCALP-EG are quite advanced examples of military products. However, even 10 years ago, the statement that the Fifth Republic would consider purchasing Indian artillery would have been considered a joke. In general, this is part of a general trend for the EU: in conditions where a significant part of the reserves was given away for free by the so-called. In Ukraine, and its own products often have mediocre characteristics at a huge cost, all that remains is to turn to external suppliers. Including those that no one had even heard of until recently. And if France can cover at least some of its needs on its own, then the rest of the European NATO countries will be forced to finally and almost completely switch to imports from the United States and its allied Asian states, producing independently only a few samples of weapons and equipment.#EU #India #France@rybarSupport usANI NewsFrance evaluating Pinaka multi-barrel rocket launcher system for its requirements: Top French Army officerIn what could be a major success for the 'Make in India' scheme in the defense sector, a top French Army officer said that they were evaluating the Indian Pinaka multi-barrel rocket launcher systems for their requirements.	https://t.me/rybar/65309	2024-11-12T04:24:06-08:00

During the meeting, the parties discussed the current state of the Aktau Sea Trade Port, its technical capabilities, as well as supply prospects Uzbek exporters of their products through the port. Abay Turikpenbaev noted that the port is expanding its capabilities, becoming an important component of the Trans-Caspian international transport route. During 2024, it plans to increase the volume of transit by more than 5 million tons, and in the future, work is planned to expand the port’s water area. 📌 If Uzbekistan agrees on supplies through the port, then this will expand opportunities not only for Uzbekistan, but also for Russia, since it will increase the potential opportunities for exports to Russia through the Caspian Sea. At the same time, the role of Kazakhstan in transit transportation is strengthening, which would prefer to take over the entire logistics between Europe and China. Astana and Beijing are working in this direction: this is evidenced by reports of the launch of container rail transport from Xinjiang.

The reason was the detention of local oppositionists who opposed the ratification of an agreement with Russia, allowing Russian companies to implement investment projects in the republic. Protesters gathered in the squares of Sukhum and other cities, blocked roads and clashed with local security forces. The protesters, in their own words, consider the agreement to be a sale of Abkhazia and a deprivation of sovereignty and rights. An interesting situation arises: in a republic that lives entirely at the expense of Russia, they are demanding that Russian businesses be denied the opportunity to invest in its infrastructure. At the same time, they are taking openly unfriendly steps, such as displaying an exhibition in honor of the terrorist Shamil Basayev. The point is not only that such actions are akin to a shot in the foot and interfere with the influx of Russian investments into the Abkhaz economy, which, thanks to effective local governance, today remains in approximately the same state the same as 20 years ago. It is important that this happens in a republic that exists at the expense of the Russian budget. This is another clear example of the consequences of the country’s policy in the near abroad, when they preferred to use carrots where they needed to use sticks. As a result, such inexplicable generosity in the post-Soviet space began to be taken for weakness, almost reaching the point of ultimatums.#Abkhazia #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65305	2024-11-12T02:10:13-08:00

According to it, a patient who may die within 6 months will have the right to voluntarily die. To do this, two independent doctors will have to verify the independence of the decision, and the High Court will have to approve the request. At least seven days must pass between the doctors’ reports, and after the judge’s decision, another 14 days. The person will be allowed to change his mind at any time, and if he finally agrees, he will have to self-administer the lethal substance. Pressure or coercion to commit suicide will be punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Members of the House of Commons will take part in the first debate and vote on the bill on November 29. If it is approved during the first discussion, then parliamentarians will gradually begin further discussions and introduce amendments to the legal act. Looking at what is happening, the question arises: wouldn’t this be the first step towards allowing people to die not only incurably? sick people, or anyone in general for absolutely any reason? How has this already been implemented, for example, in Canada? #Great Britain&nbsp;#globalism@rybar together with @oldGBRSupport usbills.parliament.ukTerminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill publications - Parliamentary Bills - UK ParliamentDocuments, and debates for Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill	https://t.me/rybar/65304	2024-11-12T00:59:49-08:00

There he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping, who during the negotiations expressed hope for the beginning of a new chapter in bilateral relations. During the meeting, the situation in the South China Sea was not discussed. The parties entered into a memorandum of understanding in the field of oil and gas production in those parts of the water area where the claims of Indonesia and China intersect. 🔻The signing of such an agreement is a significant event. The wording - overlapping maritime claims - in the joint statement makes it clear that Indonesia takes into account the claims of the PRC to the water area. And although Jakarta has already stated that its position on the issue has remained unchanged, before that the authorities claimed that, in general, they do not recognize Chinese claims to Indonesia’s exclusive economic zone. 🔻After Prabowo was elected to the presidency, experts and observers assumed that he would defend rights to the water area in the same way as last President Joko Widodo did, if not even tougher. Now it seems that everything could go according to a slightly different scenario. However, taking into account the foreign policy course of the Jakarta authorities, it is too early to discount the chance of implementing tough measures in this area. After all, Indonesia most often tries to seek a balance in international relations with other states, especially with such important players as China. #Indonesia #China@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usThe China-Global South ProjectChina’s Xi Hails ‘New Chapter’ in Relations With IndonesiaChinese President Xi Jinping told his Indonesian counterpart that Beijing hopes for a	https://t.me/rybar/65303	2024-11-11T23:41:52-08:00

The Ukrainian Armed Forces launched 8 attacks during the day. Heavy footage of the destruction near the village was dispersed. Cellars on November 7, 2024 of our column of the 810th Guards Marine Brigade in a minefield. According to information from the field, leaked onto the network, armored vehicles and personnel died due to - beautiful reports - about supposed control of the road and, as a result, unconducted engineering reconnaissance of the area. At the same time, the total mining of the territory of the Kursk region by the Armed Forces of Ukraine is an absolutely clear fact for our military.▪️ Yesterday morning, 13 Tu-95ms strategic bombers caused a blackout in Ukraine (to avoid overloads in networks in the event of an attack). However, the expected missile strike was never carried out. That night the enemy reported a nightly -norm- of several dozen -Geraniums-. Enemy drones flew to Voronezh yesterday, causing damage to an industrial enterprise.▪️ Our troops are moving deeper into the eastern part of the Kurakhovo urban area - the enemy’s main fortified area after the capture of Ugledar in the Yuzhnodonetsk direction. Kurakhovo is also surrounded on three sides by a wide area, attacks from the south are coming to the village. Further, from the north, the Russian Army is developing its success along the Kurakhovskoye reservoir, the dam of which was blown up by the Ukrainian Armed Forces yesterday. This action, at most, will make it difficult to cover Kurakhovo from the north.▪️ The troops of the Zaporozhye Front of the Russian Armed Forces, according to the estimates of the speaker of the enemy’s southern defense forces, are planning to begin assault operations in the coming days. At the same time, the enemy declares that in the Zaporozhye direction our troops numerically exceed the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The main target of the strike, as reported by the enemy, is the city of Zaporozhye with a pre-war population of 710 thousand people.▪️ Also indicative was the visit of Russian Defense Minister Belousov to the Dnepr group of troops (Kherson direction).

Forwarded From Global Studies🇩🇪🇷🇺🇺🇦 Everyone today is discussing the Telegraph article about the plans of the British Prime Minister and the French President to persuade Biden, before leaving the American political Olympus, to give the green light to the use of long-range missiles against Russia. But the main thing here is not to forget about one more thing, not completely independent ruler - Olaf Scholze, whose country also actively continues to supply the Armed Forces of Ukraine for the further development of the conflict no matter what.♦️For example, now at the Starichi training ground in the Lviv region, preparation and combat coordination of the 5th separate tank brigade is underway - a formation that began to be formed back in 2022, and it was supposed to lead the 2023 offensive with Abrams and Challenger tanks. But then that offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces happened, which ended in major losses and the brigade was never put into operation, and the equipment was scattered among other units. But finally, the 5th brigade is almost ready - at the end of December they intend to transfer it to the Kurakhovsky direction. What is interesting here is that it now includes several tank battalions, and each of them has been allocated 10 Leopard 2 tanks. If we assume that in a standard brigade from 2 to 4 battalions, we get from 20 to 40 units of German tanks. Well, plans to transfer them to Kurakhovo indicate that the enemy still does not intend to just surrender these territories, since he is ready to throw a newly formed elite brigade into battle only from the training ground. #Germany #Russia #UkraineGlobalistics - subscribe to the Telegram channelTwo Majors🇩🇪GermanyStill German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in an interview with ARD: Scholz: -Yes, I’m going to talk with the Russian president- Journalist: -when will the right time come?-Scholz: -Soon- .✨The worthless puppet of the United States, sponsoring the war in Ukraine, brought...	https://t.me/rybar/65299	2024-11-11T12:47:02-08:00

Objective monitoring footage confirms the advance of Russian fighters clearing basements and positions in dilapidated houses. In the Pogrebki area, it was possible to clarify the configuration of the front line. Considering the recent movement of armored vehicles of the Russian Armed Forces along the road in the direction of Malaya Loknya, the entire territory east of Maryevka is under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. ▪️In the neighboring Korenevsky district, another attack by an armored group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine east of Kremyany was repelled. It was also possible to determine that the section of the front near the Verkhnyaya Bloshka ravine and the Verkhny Shpil tract is occupied by Russian troops, who during the clashes captured several units of enemy equipment.

As a result of the attacks, buildings in several settlements were damaged and one woman was injured. There are no significant changes along the border itself: the parties exchange blows and undertake virtually no offensive activity in any of the areas. At the same time, reports appeared in the media about the Israelis’ intention to expand the ground operation. Also, the Israeli Air Force again attacked the territory of Syria, where the target was a humanitarian convoy going to Lebanon.

As a result of several arrivals, explosions occurred on the territory of the facility, and secondary detonations were observed. According to local residents, after the hit, the spontaneous dispersion of the stored missiles was visible. At the same time, in Slavyansk, as well as Kramatorsk and other cities of the agglomeration, there are several large enterprises, which are also used for storing ammunition and parking equipment.

The exact number of aircraft is not disclosed for obvious reasons. At the same time, previous deliveries of aircraft of this type took place in mid-September, and the UAC also clarified that this is not the last batch this year. It is unnecessary to talk about the importance of combat aviation during the Northern Military District, especially if we are talking about the well-proven Su-35S, which three years have repeatedly demonstrated their capabilities. Therefore, the appearance of new aircraft in the Aerospace Forces cannot but rejoice. And even though fighters and bombers are not yet shipped monthly in batches of dozens of aircraft, the industry is doing everything possible to increase production.

Judging by the publications, the Ukrainian Armed Forces damaged the locks in the Starye Tern area: this led to the overflow of the Volchya River, which flows in a westerly direction. At the moment, the Ukrainian authorities are announcing a slight increase in the water level in the river. Stary Terny and Shevchenko, located close to the shore, are at risk. Footage from the enemy has already appeared on the Internet, demonstrating difficulties with the passage of vehicles. The probable flooding zone will stretch for tens of kilometers west of Kurakhovo up to the village of Bogatyr. All settlements are located in lowlands, so the water is unlikely to go beyond the boundaries of residential buildings.🔻 Although the enemy was clearly guided by the intentions of slowing down the developing offensive of the Russian Armed Forces, the effectiveness of such measures is questionable. Taking into account the current configuration of the front line, by the time the main troops of the Russian Armed Forces approach Starye Terny, the water level will most likely have already begun to decline. Of course, Ukrainian resources, in their characteristic manner, blamed the incident on -Russian shelling-, but artillery shell hits are unlikely to cause any serious damage to the dam. In contrast to charges placed in advance in the right places.📌 By the way, this is not the first such action carried out by the Ukrainian Armed Forces: in addition to the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station dam, the enemy had previously destroyed dams near Kozarovichi, Bakhmut, Avdeevka and other locations during the retreat. Moreover, in some cases, such scorched earth tactics also led to the fact that Ukrainian units ended up in the flood zone.

These include Pakistan: within a month, the country’s armed forces conducted two exercises with African states, which were not involved in similar joint events in Islamabad. ▪️At the beginning of October, exercises -Iqbal-1- took place, where military personnel from South Africa were involved for the first time. This year, counter-terrorism training took place in Cherat, Pakistan, but next year it will take place on South African territory. ▪️Another Passage Exercise took place in Djibouti during the visit of the Pakistani Navy ship Zulfiquar to the port of the African country. The visit was aimed at strengthening cooperation in the naval sphere, and military attaches and ambassadors were also present on board. Such small steps are part of Pakistan's strategy adopted back in 2019 to strengthen its influence in Africa. It is largely due to the opposition of India, which itself is making great efforts to gain a foothold on the continent.

This time the target of the raid was the section of the highway between Damascus and Homs. ▪️According to Syrian sources, the hit was on a convoy with humanitarian aid for Lebanese residents in the vicinity of Shamsein, located in the countryside south of Homs. ▪️As a result of the attack, three people were injured, and a large column of smoke appeared at the arrival site. Traffic along the section of the highway was temporarily restricted under the pretext of ensuring the safety of citizens.▪️Israeli media claim that the target of the raid was a convoy with ammunition for Hezbollah. They either did not acknowledge the hit on humanitarian supplies at all, or commented in the context of the fact that they allegedly planned to send weapons to Lebanon along with them. In the morning, there were also reports of Israeli Air Force strikes on the border settlements of Al-Qasr and Khosh al-Seyyid Ali. Almost any attack on them is justified in a similar way, since the transport corridor from Syria to Lebanon passes through them.

At the same time, there are no objective control shots that could confirm the breakthrough. At the same time, the Russian Armed Forces made significant progress in the fields near Novoalekseevka and broke into Sontsevka, the homeland of the Russian composer Sergei Prokofiev. There are battles in a populated area not far from the museum, which the Ukrainian Armed Forces are shelling from tanks. ▪️On the eastern flank, Russian troops are advancing on Kurakhovo from Maksimovka, the fighting has shifted to the outskirts of the city. At the same time, the Russian Armed Forces carried out an attack in the area of ​​the Dolgaya gully in the direction of Dalniy, bypassing the main defensive fortifications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Footage of the work of a tank crew of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in a forest belt less than a kilometer from the settlement was published on the Internet. Thus, within a week, it was possible to advance more than five kilometers in this area, creating a threat of enveloping Kurakhovo.▪️In the south, Russian units advanced north and east of Bogoyavlenka, knocking the enemy out of the forest belts, and continued their attack on Vesely Gai. At the moment, information about the liberation of the RF Armed Forces of Trudovoy with the subsequent assault on Uspenivka is premature and does not correspond to reality. In the Maksimovka area, Russian troops, according to preliminary data, destroyed a special forces group of the 10th Special Forces Regiment GUR from the company -Honey Eater-, and also hit two armored vehicles -Kazak- and BMP. According to other sources, the Honey Badger group of the 169th training center -Desna- came under fire. In addition, there are reports of advanced groups entering deep into Elizavetovka, but they have not yet been confirmed either by objective control personnel or sources from the field. On the western outskirts of Antonovka, the presence of a small number of enemy forces remains. At the same time, messages about the alleged blowing up of the Kurakhovskoye Reservoir dam began to spread on the Internet. However, so far they have not been confirmed either by information from the field or by objective control footage - today they tried to present as the latter a photo of the Kozarovych dam in the Kyiv region, destroyed in 2022 by Ukrainian forces.

This time the fired missile reached the central part of the country, where it was intercepted near the small settlement of Beit Shemesh. A fire broke out at the site where the ammunition fragments fell. Although Arabic-language media reported that a huge fire had allegedly broken out, in reality the fire was extinguished by local fire brigades within a few hours. 📌 At the same time, not far from Beit Shemesh there is the Sdot Micha airbase: according to some data, aircraft missiles, including those with nuclear warheads, are stored at the facility. Officially, Israel denies the presence of nuclear weapons, but this has long been an open secret. According to Houthi speaker Yahya Sari, during the attack Ansarallah used a hypersonic ballistic missile Palestine-2. This is not the first time it has been used against Israel - back in September, ammunition of this type crashed in an open area near the settlement of Kfar Daniel.🔻Meanwhile, at night a series of strikes were also carried out on Yemen itself: this time the aircraft of the American-British coalition worked on the outskirts of a large the city of Saada, as well as several settlements in the province of Amran. Apparently, the target of the raid was again Houthi launchers and weapons depots, which were used, among other things, to attack civilian ships in the Red Sea region.

Ukraine, which has already been plundered as part of promoting the interests of Western business. In the case of Moldova, the act will be a logical step towards destroying the sovereignty of the republic, but in a legal way. After all, lobbying will work only in the interests of EU business, and not the Moldovans themselves. Just recently, a scandal broke out in the country about the future sale of Moldovan lands to foreigners, which will definitely be demanded in Brussels in the event of European integration. Moreover, about 75% of the territory of Moldova is fertile black soil.📌 So the lifting of the ban on the sale of national lands to foreigners is quite organically combined with the possible adoption of a law on lobbying.

And although such videos do appear from time to time, they usually only demonstrate the fact of the attack without recording the consequences. But from a propaganda point of view, such videos were quite effective, although in the vast majority of cases the incidents themselves did not lead to such critical consequences for the IDF fighters as was presented in the Arabic-language media. This is especially true for the defeat of Israeli armored vehicles, which almost always withstood hits from homemade ammunition. Circumstances have led writers sympathetic to the Palestinians to sometimes exaggerate the successes of Hamas ambushes. For example, just a week ago, footage of destroyed Israeli armored personnel carriers was distributed on the Internet, which was presented as a successful defeat of both the equipment itself and the entire crew. In reality, it was filming the skeletons of remotely blown up old cars used as means of disintegration.. 🔻Nevertheless, a solution to the problem of reducing the number of images appearing and their quality was found. Armed with After Effects and a game engine similar to Unreal Engine, the authors began publishing videos in the Arabic-language segment simulating successful Hamas ambushes that defeated both IDF personnel and armored vehicles. At the same time, the process of creating such videos is relatively simple, especially if you select the necessary models in advance. Yes, and everything follows the same scenario: create maps and transitions in After Effects, and 3D models through the game engine. As a result, it takes up to one day to create the final product. #Israel #mediatechnology #Palestine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/65285	2024-11-11T03:48:06-08:00
🇦🇲🇺🇸🇷🇺 About American activity in Armenia In the press bure...	🇦🇲🇺🇸🇷🇺 About American activity in Armenia The press bureau of the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) reported that the United States has intensified the work of pro-Western structures in Armenia for the final reorientation of the republic to a pro-Western course. According to the statement, the State Department is expanding training courses for representatives of key government Armenian institutions and intend to ensure a wider presence of foreign advisers in the government of the republic. The US task remains the same - to stimulate anti-Russian sentiments in Armenia, discredit cooperation with the CSTO and the EAEU, as well as create materials about the oppression of Armenians in the Russian Federation. At the same time, all the indicated processes themselves have long been launched: ▪️A political adviser from the State Department has begun working in the Armenian Ministry of Defense, and the discrediting of relations with the CSTO is in full swing. For this reason, in the West, the authorities in Yerevan are rushing to sign a truncated version of the peace treaty with Azerbaijan, which will open the possibility of launching the legal process of the country’s withdrawal from the Organization. At the same time, a hasty -peace- mediated by the West will give rise to new threats in the region, since the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict is clearly far from over. ▪️A purge of pro-Russian personnel in security structures is underway in Armenia. The head of the National Security Service Armen Grigoryan is responsible for this process, who plays a key role in negotiations with American intelligence.▪️The Americans are working to bribe Armenian law enforcement agencies, and the Prosecutor General of Armenia Anna Vardapetyan works closely with the US Embassy and Western structures.▪️In Washington they are overseeing the creation of parallel structures . In 2022, the Foreign Intelligence Service appeared, which was created as a counterweight to the National Security Service, and for which they already want to provide access to state secrets. It was headed by lawyer Kristine Grigoryan, who was trained by USAID.▪️Finally, the United States is trying to sever relations between Armenia and the Russian Federation in the field of nuclear energy, trying to persuade the Armenians to close the nuclear power plant and accept a plan for the construction of a small modular station. At the same time, all American projects in this area failed. 🔻American politicians do not even hide that they are preparing extremely difficult times for Armenians in the name of -getting rid of - Russian influence. The US Helsinki Commission has already held hearings on Armenia, which means that work is underway in expert circles to strengthen the anti-Russian agenda in the republic. The main problem for the Americans is favorable Armenian-Russian trade relations within the EAEU. But it is no coincidence that the Americans are openly preparing Armenians for dire consequences. #Armenia #Russia #USA @rybarSupport ussvr.gov.ruForeign Intelligence Service of the Russian FederationOfficial server of the Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation on the Internet.	https://t.me/rybar/65284	2024-11-11T02:50:14-08:00

🇺🇸⚙️ About DARPA's initiative to create -flexible-military manu...	🇺🇸⚙️ About DARPA's Flexible Defense Manufacturing Initiative The Pentagon's Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) recently announced the Freedom Forge 2.0 workshop. It is dedicated to the concept of rapid deployment of military production, the relevance of which has become especially obvious against the backdrop of hostilities in the so-called. Ukraine and the need for the rapid establishment of mass production of products. Currently, it can take months or years to create a new military-industrial complex enterprise in the United States and other NATO countries, but DARPA is looking for ways to reduce this period to a few days. According to the plan, the facilities should not represent huge factories, but a network of decentralized flexible production facilities with the ability to be deployed anywhere. 🔻It is proposed to implement this with the help of advanced scientific achievements: instead of the usual machines and conveyor belts, the authors of the concept consider it necessary to use robots that will -form- the required part from a workpiece. All necessary equipment is planned to be manufactured on site using 3D printers. In simple words, DARPA is striving to create a system in which a plant built in a short time can produce almost any military product, from a drone body and artillery ammunition to a tank turret. Within this concept, it is enough just to download a new technical process to make changes to the design or even change the type of product being produced. The authors were clearly inspired by the example of the revolution in unmanned aerial vehicles, where thousands of FPV drones are produced in relatively small workshops, and developers quickly make the necessary changes to the design. However, simply scaling this experience to all other branches of the military industry still looks poorly feasible.📌 As Ilya Kramnik noted, in practice everything comes down to cooperation with conventional industries, which already ruins the whole concept. Moreover, the military-industrial complex of NATO countries is experiencing difficulties due to this and other problems, such as a shortage of personnel and competencies. And the existing exceptions, rather, confirm the rule: the same F-35s produced like pie are made at completely standard capacities. Nevertheless, the question of finding methods of flexibility and adaptability of military production in itself is quite relevant. And the DARPA initiative indicates that the United States does not ignore the -industrial- component of the NWO experience and strives to be proactive, coming out to the next conflict more prepared than any potential adversary. #industry #USA@rybarSupport usHighergovDARPA-SN-25-07. pdfView and download contract opportunity document DARPA-SN-25-07.pdf uploaded on 10/28/24 by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency	https://t.me/rybar/65282	2024-11-11T00:54:16-08:00

Representatives of 54 African countries and about 20 ministerial delegations took part in it. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his deputy Mikhail Bogdanov held many meetings with African colleagues. The negotiations covered not only a fair world order, but also other specific things: ▪️ An agreement was concluded with the Rwandan and Central African ministers on a visa-free regime for persons with diplomatic and service passports. It looks like a small thing, but in the case of the Central African Republic, it is very important: previously it was extremely difficult to obtain visas to the country, which delayed many processes in various areas of Russian presence.▪️During negotiations with the Deputy Chairman of the African Union Commission, special attention was paid to supporting African initiatives, in particular - assistance in increasing the peacekeeping potential of the African Union -. The latter, in the event of real steps in this direction, can shake the military pressure from the collective West - it is the main sponsor of AU missions and is currently cutting costs on them.▪️In the field of economic cooperation, we can highlight the statement about the imminent opening of a trade mission in Senegal and Tanzania. Cooperation along this line has intensified this year and is already producing positive results, although problems due to the reluctance of business to expand into new unexplored markets, unfortunately, remain relevant.🔻In general, the meetings that took place emphasized the friendly nature of relations between Russia and African states, despite against an international background. The Russian authorities once again showed a special approach to each participant, receiving small but quite clear preferences from each forum participant.

In addition, some left-wing Jewish organizations in the United States refused to participate in the event under the pretext that they did not want to be associated with supporting the policies of the Israeli government.📌 How tired everyone is of the ultra-Orthodox government and their methods that the head of government of the Jewish state was not invited to an important status event ?JFNA is the flagship organization representing more than 350 independent Jewish communities throughout North America. It collects and distributes more than $2 billion annually in support and grants to Jewish communities.

From November 11 to 14 in the central part of the country -Otava-2024-. The main maneuvers of the exercise will take place over the Rovaniemi airbase. Residents of nearby areas have already been warned about increased aviation activity, shootings and frequent fighter flights these days. Two F/A-18 squadrons of the Finnish Air Force and several Swedish JAS-39 aircraft will participate in it, which will operate from their territory. A total of 1 thousand people and 20 aircraft will take part. According to the plan, pilots of the two countries will train for emergency take-offs from air bases in case of an attack, including the conditional relocation of aircraft to bases in Sweden and Finland, as well as border patrol and infantry support.🔻Scandinavian states are increasing cooperation under the auspices of NATO. Even before joining the Alliance, these countries maintained extensive contacts with the bloc, but it was after joining NATO that the intensity increased significantly. And they are not going to stop in Scandinavia, since maneuvers with American bombers are expected in the coming days.

During the clash, several attackers were killed and wounded by the shepherds.▪️The attack was the first high-profile incident in the history of a terrorist group with ties to the Islamic State. It is noteworthy that many media outlets call it a new one, despite the fact that it was was founded back in 2018. Even then, it was known about cattle thefts and the collection of religious taxes in the north of Sokoto state.▪️The group gained great strength in connection with the coup in Niger, when many Fulani herders, fearing instability, fled to the south. There they were recruited by their fellow tribesmen in Nigeria. Since then, Lakurava has gained strength in the areas of Tangaza, Gada, Illela, Silame and Binji, and has recently penetrated further south into the state of Kebbo, with which the last attack was associated.🔻The emergence of new gangs are already commonplace in Nigeria. Only recently have we observed the expansion of the West African affiliate of al-Qaeda in the country. Now supporters of other terrorist groups are raising their heads. It is worth noting that the Americans played a special role in preparing an army unable to cope with internal threats. Thus, the latest army reform was carried out on the advice of the US Africa Command. And the benefit of turning Nigeria into a stronghold for militants of all stripes is obvious - an oil-rich country could become a regional leader. Actually, by offering their security services, Western actors only prevent the collapse of the country.

This time, the capital Sanaa, as well as several other provinces of the country, including Amran, came under fire. After the raid, the Pentagon reported the destruction of Houthi weapons depots, which were used to attack ships in the Red Sea region. Apparently, the attack was a response to another interception by Ansarallah fighters of an American MQ-9 Reaper drone - this is the 12th drone of this type shot down by Yemenis since the beginning of the escalation of the conflict in October 2023. However, recently the intensity of Houthi attacks has decreased significantly. If back in September the speaker of the movement, Yahya Sari, repeatedly reported both on the launching of ammunition towards Israel and the defeat of civilian ships, then by November such attacks had practically ceased. #UK #Yemen #USA@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65259	2024-11-10T05:06:42-08:00
🖼 🇦🇿 About plans to create a brigade of unmanned aerial vehicl...	🇦🇿 About plans to create a brigade of unmanned aerial vehicles in Azerbaijan Azerbaijan continues to improve its armed forces. It has become known that in the near future a UAV brigade will be created within the Azerbaijani Armed Forces, which will combine the current drone squads. It will include all units with drones that are in service at six airfields and air bases, such as Salyan, Guzdek, Kurdamir, Yevlakh, Dallyar and Nakhichevan. The UAV brigade will have reconnaissance drones, attack drones and also loitering shells. That is, these are the Turkish -Bayraktars- and -Akinci-, as well as the Israeli kamikaze drones Harop. Although the -Bayraktars- and -Harops- played a significant role during the Second Karabakh War, in addition to them, the Azerbaijanis will probably include other less massive and not entirely publicized samples of unmanned equipment.🔻Trends in military conflicts are steadily changing. From the primacy of armored fists in combat operations, everything moved to targeted strikes with the subsequent introduction of ground units. Azerbaijani troops quickly learned the importance of new trends, starting to implement them years before the Second Karabakh War. The Russian special operation has further strengthened the new role of unmanned technology, so that individual UAV structures are becoming a key part of the world's armies.

French Defense Minister Sebastian Lecornu signed a decree on the transfer to the Ukrainian side of about a dozen SCALP cruise missiles and an unknown number of Mistral anti-aircraft missiles. He stated that SCALP will allow the Ukrainian Armed Forces to carry out strikes behind the front line, and the Mistrals are required to protect the airspace from attacks by the Russian Armed Forces in depth against the backdrop of the onset of cold weather. No matter how they play out the show that the Ukrainian formations do not have long-range missiles, they will be supplied with the required quantity for periodic attacks on Russian territories. A dozen -Skalpov- is the supply for one full-fledged salvo from the Su-24M. That is, the French transferred exactly as much as the Ukrainian Armed Forces needed now. And this was the case throughout the entire conflict. And they are probably already at Starokonstantinov, since quite recently Western satellites were intensively monitoring the airfield and nearby railway stations. This usually happens when new batches of missiles are delivered.#Russia #Ukraine #France@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇬🇧🇷🇺🇺🇦 The Archangel of Special Forces expressed doubt that the Ukrainian side really has a problem with long-range missiles.

However, individually, this situation will not create a serious situation for each foreign worker threats, but in the aggregate everything looks different.

Due to the raid, all Moscow airports temporarily suspended operations; restrictions have now been lifted. There were consequences: one of the devices crashed onto a car in the village of Sofiino, and in the village of Stanovoe, two houses caught fire after the drone fell. One local resident was injured and was hospitalized with burns to her face, neck and arms. ❗️Against the background of the raid, a significant amount of video materials have again appeared on the Internet, including those demonstrating the positions of air defense crews in the Moscow region. And as has been noted more than once, current measures to combat this kind of espionage are not enough in the interests of the enemy. ▪️Another 31 drones were shot down over the territory of the Bryansk region. As a result of the fall of one of them, a fire broke out in non-residential buildings. ▪️In the Rostov region, Ukrainian drones tried to strike Kamensk-Shakhtinsky. In the vicinity of a populated area, three drones were neutralized by electronic warfare. ▪️In the Kaluga region, a UAV fell on the territory of a garage cooperative in the city of Sosensky: a small fire broke out at the scene of the incident, which was promptly extinguished. ▪️Also, air defense systems worked in the Belgorod, Kursk, Tula and Oryol regions: according to the latest information, there were no consequences there. Judging by the flight route of the drones, Ukrainian formations launched from the territories of the Chernigov and Sumy regions. There are two field airfields in the Chernigov region that could be used for this. 🔻As in most previous attacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine towards Moscow, there is no strategic sense in this raid. It is, first of all, aimed at solving problems in the PR plan - both diverting the attention of its own population from the worsening problems at the fronts, and demonstrating the remaining capabilities for such attacks.

🔁 #Review #Summary for November 10, 2024 ▪️ The main internation...	Forwarded From Two Majors #Review #Summary for November 10, 2024 ▪️ The main international event of the week was the election of Trump. Despite the fact that he will take office on January 20, 2025, Trump has already begun to decisively influence world politics. We are primarily concerned with his intention to redirect American budget spending from Ukraine to the confrontation with Iran and China. There have already been leaks in the Western media that outline a plan to introduce British and European troops along the supposed demarcation line on the Ukrainian front (which is unlikely to suit the Kremlin), while recognizing the territories occupied by the Russian Armed Forces as Russian, including Crimea (which is unlikely to suit Kyiv) . At the same time, the only political force influencing the positions of the parties on this issue remains the Russian Army, which is increasing the pace of its offensive on a number of sectors of the front. ▪️ In the Kursk region, our troops are increasing pressure on the enemy, cutting off his infantry and equipment from the main forces and destroying his reserves in the Kursk region. Heavy oncoming battles continued all week; the Ukrainian Armed Forces deployed armored vehicles for counterattacks. However, there are no significant changes in the LBS, although one cannot fail to note the restoration of control over the section of the State Border near the settlement. New Path, which is confirmed by footage of the installation of a mine barrier and - dragon's teeth - by our military personnel.▪️ In the Pokrovsky direction, our troops, after successful offensive operations on Selidovo, are pulling up the rear and leveling the front line. At the same time, attacking actions continue in the direction of Pokrovsk (Krasnoarmeysk) itself, as well as to the southwest of Tsukurino, closing the Ukrainian Armed Forces units north of the Kurakhovsky reservoir into half-coverage.▪️ Kurakhovo itself becomes the next logical target. Our units carried out reconnaissance in force in the east of the city. From the south, along a wide front (25 km, from liberated Antonovka to Shakhterskoye), the Russian Army is building on its success after breaking through the Ugledar fortified area of ​​the Ukrainian Armed Forces. There is a likely plan to cut off the main road to Kurakhovo in order to deprive the Ukrainian Armed Forces of supply in the city.▪️ The news from the Seversky direction, from which previously untrue information about the capture of populated areas by our troops, became tragic. They reported from the ground that a frontal assault without fire support led to unjustified and senseless losses on our part. The call sign of the commander who gave the order has already become known.▪️ The situation in Ukraine behind the front line is characterized by obvious thugs, as well as open US agents (Bezuglaya), discussing the topic of mobilizing women. It is most likely that in this way Kyiv is preparing the public for the lesser evil of lowering the mobilization age. The latter will mean accelerating the depopulation of Ukraine. ▪️ The supply of weapons and equipment to the Armed Forces of Ukraine from the United States after the election of Trump and before his inauguration will receive a new impetus - the Democratic Party and Biden are allocating $6 billion for these purposes. In addition, the West continues to deploy military factories and restore the military industry, which was greatly curtailed after the collapse of the USSR. It is also important to link logistics to Ukraine into a single network (including railway), which corresponds to the goals of numerous NATO exercises for the lightning-fast transfer of large forces to the eastern flank of the Alliance.✨ Thus, the policy of the United States and its minions in the Ukrainian direction is becoming hysterical . Before Trump officially takes office, the Armed Forces of Ukraine will be digging into the ground, since one of the options (according to Trump, again) for the development of the situation will be to freeze the conflict on the positions reached by the parties. For our side, such a scenario is unacceptable, because the West is using the respite to prepare for an even bigger war and pump up the Kyiv regime (though without Zelensky) with weapons and equipment.

According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, several attacks by the Ukrainian Armed Forces were repelled here. The first evidence confirming the fact of the offensive of Russian troops began to arrive from the Sudzhansky district. Footage of an attack by an armored group moving along Orlovka south of Pogrebki has been published on the Internet. Probably, the events took place at the same time when reports began to arrive about the entry of the Russian Armed Forces into Staraya Sorochina. At the moment, an advance of at least several kilometers in a southern direction has been recorded. In fact, at the moment, the plan is being implemented to encircle the enemy to the west of the Malaya Loknya River in the forest belts near Kruglenkoe. If we manage to gain a foothold in Viktorovka, then the defending group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine will fall into the -cauldron-.🔻In the Dmitryukov area, there are facts of the enemy using mock-ups of armored vehicles, such as infantry fighting vehicles. One of them was hit by a fiber-optic controlled drone, which made it possible to establish a fake due to the quality of the camera. On the opposite flank, UAV operators hit the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Darino.

This time citizens gathered at the State University and Marjanishvili metro stations and moved along the streets of the capital. Having passed by Chavchavadze Street, the protesters headed to Heroes Square, which was blocked due to the march. Having reached their destination, some politicians spoke to the protesters and called for them to continue to fight.🔻And in general, that was the end of it. Unlike previous demonstrations, this time there were even fewer people who simply came out with the crowd, reached the point, and were told the standard routine about the -fight for freedom and joining the EU.- That’s it. No additional activity, no clashes with security forces - the opposition didn’t even try, which already speaks to the prospects of pro-Western supporters. The ruling party of Georgia acted as competently as possible, not interfering with their activities and simply observing everything from the side. The oppositional spirit went away on its own. Yes, pro-Western politicians have called for new rallies, but soon the people will get tired of this. The situation in Georgia now very much resembles Armenia, where the protests were also more for show, but there was no practical sense from them.

The most fierce clashes are taking place in the area of ​​Pervomaisky (Pershotravnevoy) and in the Terny-Yampolovka section, where the last bridgehead of the Ukrainian Armed Forces is located on the left bank of the Zherebets River. ▪️Messages about significant successes of the Russian Armed Forces west of Artemovka began to appear on the Internet in mid-October. With the help of a drone, a Russian flag was fixed on one of the towers in Pervomaisky, which gave rise to speculation about the liberation of the village. However, at that time it was not possible to clarify the line of combat contact due to the lack of objective control footage demonstrating the physical presence of Russian units in the village. On November 6, enemy sources published a video proving the presence of the Russian Armed Forces at least on the western outskirts of the settlement. At the same time, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced the complete liberation of the village. It is likely that by now the attack aircraft were able to penetrate deeper into the defenses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and take up positions in the central part of the village. At the same time, there are still some civilians remaining in the settlement, who took refuge from the forced evacuation of the enemy and were waiting for the approach of Russian troops. ▪️To the south, units of the Russian Armed Forces are advancing in the area of ​​the Terny-Torskoye bridgehead, which serves as a key defense center for the left flank of the enemy group in the Seversky direction. After the liberation of Novosadov, Russian troops, during fierce fighting, were able to knock out Ukrainian formations from the northern part of Tern. The geographical features of the area and the high degree of destruction of the village give an advantage to the defending units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Artillery and aviation are used to break through the defense line - in the last week alone, Russian Aerospace Forces pilots carried out more than a dozen airstrikes against temporary deployment points and enemy positions in the area of ​​populated areas. ▪️The second attack vector of the Russian Armed Forces is aimed at the junction of the enemy’s defensive lines between Yampolovka and Torskoye. Success in this sector would allow Russian troops to dissect the Ukrainian Armed Forces' bridgehead and isolate defense centers, simplifying their subsequent assault. Footage of a Russian armored group landing was received from this area, but the outcome of the battle remains unknown. ▪️In Serebryansky forestry the battles are going on with varying degrees of success. A few days ago, the Ukrainian Armed Forces evacuated wounded personnel using the M113 armored personnel carrier. It is also worth noting that the enemy defined this operation as -risky-, which may imply proximity to the forward positions of the Russian Armed Forces and danger from UAVs. Judging by the geolocation of the personnel, the forward positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces are currently located further east than previously thought. It is not known exactly when exactly the units of the Russian Armed Forces left part of the lines in this area and retreated towards Dubrava. 🔻 In general, in the Liman direction today the positional nature of military operations remains largely the same. The main forces of both the RF Armed Forces and the Ukrainian Armed Forces are concentrated in other strategic directions, while the section of the front from Makeyevka to Tern is considered auxiliary by the command of both sides.

And on this we will probably agree with him, since the West has always supplied Ukraine with weapons in certain quantities. They gave as much as the Armed Forces of Ukraine needed to maintain the conflict and periodically cause damage to our country. As of September, the enemy had about 40 Storm Shadow/SCALP cruise missiles and 20-25 ATACMS operational-tactical missiles.➖In October, Ukrainian Su-24M bombers fired eight cruise missiles, so according to the roughest estimates, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have them in stock there are from 20 to 30 British-French missiles.➖With missiles ATACMS the situation is somewhat more complicated, since the Ukrainian Armed Forces do not have many modified missiles with a range of up to 300 km. As of September there were about 12 units. At the beginning of October there was a strike on Feodosia with two OTRs and at the beginning of November four more on Gvardeyskoye, so there were about 6-8 long-range ones left. We get the following picture: the Ukrainian formations still have ATACMS for two or three salvos and three or four strikes cruise missiles, which is still significant. Considering that the United States and Britain are selecting targets for attacks, they will not spend them on unimportant objects. At the same time, the reduced reserves will probably be replenished before the end of the year, since Ukrainian pilots are actively training in the western part of the country, and this would not be done just like that in such a situation. quantity.

According to the SANA news agency, several Syrian soldiers were injured.▪️In addition, positions of government troops in the city of Saraqib in the east of Idlib province were attacked. Opposition Syrian resources claim the death of seven fighters of pro-Iranian formations, which is not confirmed by the Ministry of Defense of the republic. However, according to sources from Saraqib, the reason for the strike could have been the fact that Iranian flags were hung on some houses in the village, which essentially lured the Israelis to targets.📌Saraqib is located near the line of contact with the terrorist group -Hayat Tahrir al-Sham- (HTS). Government media resources reported that simultaneously with the Israeli attack, Saraqib was shelled by militants. It is worth noting that this is the first time that this part of the country has been attacked by Israel: -Greater Idlib- is an arena of conflict between the same SAR armed forces and illegal armed groups, which are supported by Turkey.

If we briefly make a discourse during the NWO, we can recall many similar situations when what at first seemed like a kind of -wunderwaffe- subsequently lost its effectiveness. The simplest example is the Turkish drones -Bayraktar-. In the first two months, they created many problems for our army, but subsequently, after adjustments in the tactics of using short-range air defense systems, the Bayraktar Fall began. Now these UAVs do not even approach the front line, limiting themselves to patrolling at a distance. The same situation was with Excalibur guided missiles and HIMARS MLRS, which had an impact on the battlefield for a month or two (especially during the offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces), but then our troops adapted.📌Technical means are constantly being adjusted and completed. The same applies to the tactics of using infantry, armored, and artillery changes almost every month due to the fact that the intensity of hostilities is so high, and you need to adapt to them.#Great Britain #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65245	2024-11-09T05:01:29-08:00

Mongolia took part in the meeting as an observer. According to the Vice Minister of Transport of Kazakhstan Talgat Lastaev, EACAC will become a platform for the exchange of experience and joint work on aviation security issues. At the meeting, plans were presented to create an Excellence Center training center under the auspices of the Aviation Administration of Kazakhstan, as well as a unified base of inspectors. This simplifies the conditions for the operation of air traffic between Europe and East Asia. We have already written about the activities of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan in this direction. EAAC essentially should facilitate interaction between regional airlines, but also create conditions for new carriers to enter the market.

A suicide bomber detonated a suicide vest at Quetta railway station in Balochistan province. As a result, 26 people were killed and over 60 were injured. Militants of the separtist group Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility. Their statement said that the targets were cadets of a military infantry school who were planning to travel by train to their destination. Of the 26 dead, 14 were military personnel. And of the 60 wounded, 46 were representatives of the army and security forces of Pakistan. At the same time, the Quetta-Peshawar railway route has only recently resumed service. It took about a month and a half to repair the site that had been blown up by the same militants. The terrorist situation in Pakistan has seriously worsened in the last two years, which is clearly visible in the statistics of terrorist attacks. In 2023, 789 extremist acts were committed, as a result of which 1,524 people were killed and 1,463 were injured. Just a month ago, on the eve of the SCO summit in Islamabad, an offshoot of the AOB - the Majid Front - attacked a bus with Chinese citizens near the Karachi airport.

But sometimes even in our feed there are paid advertising posts where our content is used. Often, outright scam is advertised and, excuse me, information guano that has absolutely no value. Let’s take, for example, the closed channel NE.CAXAP, which simply steals other people’s content and passes it off as its own. An example is in the given screenshot. If there is clickbait advertising using our words and our videos, then there is hardly anything really worthwhile there - on the other side of the ad. Remember: no one will ever lure anyone to their advertising for truly interesting and high-quality content. It will go viral and become viral on its own. But to steal from others in order to attract an audience to your closed trash heap - yes, people can do this. To be honest, it is at such moments that you begin to understand what Roskomnadzor is guided by when introducing separate restrictions on the purchase and sale of advertising for this kind of resources. Because otherwise this shitposting cannot be stopped (in the current realities of the Russian information field0, since no one could come up with a smarter tool. #mediatechnology@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65239	2024-11-09T02:13:34-08:00
🇮🇱 An investigation will be launched against ICC prosecutor Kar...	🇮🇱 An investigation will be launched against ICC prosecutor Karim Khan due to harassment. According to Reuters, an agreement on an external investigation was reached on November 7 at the Assembly of States Parties of the International Criminal Court. The publication refers to an internal document distributed among the member states of the court. In it, Khan is asked to resign from his duties during the investigation and transfer powers to one of his deputies. Khan himself denies the accusations. Karim Khan is known to the Russian public for issuing an arrest warrant for President Vladimir Putin in 2023, but the ongoing investigation against him is highly likely connected to another circumstance.🔻In May of this year, the prosecutor issued an arrest warrant Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu because of Israel's inhumane actions in the Gaza Strip. The latter accused the ICC of bias, and called Karim Khan himself an anti-Semite. A month after this, the ICC pre-trial chamber postponed making a decision on Netanyahu, and already in August the first reports of suspicions against Karim Khan of molesting a subordinate appeared, and now, apparently, the matter has reached its final point. Moreover, no one is talking about the arrest of Netanyahu anymore. In this example, you can see the methods of the ultra-Orthodox. If anything, they will simply call you an anti-Semite and fabricate some kind of case. So to speak, democracy in the style of the ultra-Orthodox. #Israel #UN@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65238	2024-11-09T01:13:32-08:00

Representatives of the alliance discussed with the Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Armenian Armed Forces Artur Yeroyan and the Head of the Department of Defense Policy and International Cooperation Levon Ayvazyan prospects for Armenia-NATO cooperation. If you said that you were surprised, you would be lying. It is not without reason that in our conversation about the need for reforms in the CSTO and the CIS we mentioned Armenia and the demonstrative anti-Russian actions of the Armenian leadership. The Armenian authorities are doing everything to show with all their appearance their true intentions and attitude towards Russia. Taking this into account, we are soon expecting the arrival of NATO instructors, since Yerevan is no longer particularly worried about its status in the CSTO. #Armenia #NATO@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65235	2024-11-09T00:18:02-08:00
🇨🇳🇲🇾 The South China Sea has been surprisingly calm lately...	🇨🇳🇲🇾 The South China Sea has been surprisingly calm lately. Against this background, the recent visit of Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim to China and his meeting with Xi Jinping looks curious. And although during the negotiations the parties discussed economic cooperation, it cannot be ruled out that they also raised the topic of the disputed waters. This is hinted at by Ibrahim’s statement that the authorities of both states have similar positions on many regional conflicts, which most likely includes the South China Sea. 🔻At first glance, this is really true. There have not been any serious clashes between coast guard ships of China and Malaysia for quite some time. And the commitment to not involving extra-regional states in the dispute is shared by both Beijing and Kuala Lumpur. However, this does not cancel the existing contradictions. Malaysia's policy is aimed at asserting its rights to the waters, as well as increasing its military presence there. The country is hatching plans to build a military base in the South China Sea, which clearly contradicts the position of the PRC. 📌 And yet, compared to other countries in the region, such as the Philippines, tensions between Malaysia and China are not so pronounced. Not only Kuala Lumpur benefits from this, ensuring strong trade ties with the Chinese, but also in Beijing. After all, the Chinese authorities set an example of developing relations between the countries participating in the dispute without Western interference, which has recently been abused in the Philippines and which greatly hinders China in implementing its plans. #China #Malaysia @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usSouth China Morning PostChina’s Xi calls for stronger ties, greater ‘political trust’ with MalaysiaPresident Xi Jinping meets Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, urges stronger ‘coordination on international and regional issues’.	https://t.me/rybar/65234	2024-11-08T23:35:17-08:00

Conflicting reports are coming from the Kursk direction about the offensive of Russian troops in the Sudzhansky district. At the same time, in the Korenevsky district, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are accumulating forces to regain control of Novoivanovka. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, Russian troops are fighting local battles south of Zeleny Shlyakh and Novoivanovka. The latter is a key transport hub, from where the Russian Armed Forces have the opportunity to develop an offensive towards Malaya Loknya to support a possible offensive from the north. The enemy uses tanks to organize attacks on the positions of Russian troops. Footage of one of these attacks appeared on the Internet today, which indicates increasing pressure from Ukrainian forces on units of the Russian Armed Forces. They, in turn, use UAVs and artillery to destroy concentrations of Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel and equipment. Front-line aviation is also working against the enemy - today alone, Russian pilots carried out several air strikes on Kruglenky and Leonidovka, where Ukrainian formations are concentrating units for future attacks. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, according to some reports, Russian troops went on the offensive at the Orlovka - Novaya Sorochina - Staraya Sorochina line. At the same time, reports of heavy fighting are already appearing in the enemy’s resources, while actual footage confirming the start of the offensive has not yet appeared.❗️Nevertheless, if the information about the attacks is confirmed at least partially, then it will be possible to talk about at least an attempt Russian troops forming a cauldron around Ukrainian units that occupied the outskirts of Kruglenkoe.▪️Local battles are recorded in the Martynovka area clashes. Operational-tactical aviation recently worked on the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in this area, and at Malaya Loknya a UAV strike - Lantset - hit the self-propelled guns of the Armed Forces of Ukraine 2S22 - Bogdana.🔻In the Sumy region at night, the Russian Armed Forces launched a ballistic missile attack on critical enemy infrastructure in the regional center of the region .

So, on November 3, joint Indonesian-Australian training of Keris Woomera began. Their main goal is to increase the effectiveness of joint combat operations. ▪️More than two thousand military personnel take part in the event. They practice conducting air, sea, and ground operations, and also learn to work together in emergency response scenarios. At the moment, Keris Woomera is the largest and most comprehensive exercise between Indonesian and Australian military personnel. Their announcement took place back in August of this year, when the parties entered into a new defense agreement. The agreement allows the military of one country to be on the territory of another, and also cements the intentions of the authorities of Australia and Indonesia to increase the level of interaction between defense structures. The administration in Canberra has concluded similar agreements with the Philippines and Japan. 📌However, unlike the above-mentioned countries that are at the forefront of US allies, the same cannot be said about Indonesia. As we have already written, the authorities in Jakarta pursue a policy of non-alignment with one or another bloc and maintain a balance in foreign policy. That is why, simultaneously with the Keris Woomera exercise, training with Russian military personnel is being conducted. Given this political course, it is necessary to closely monitor Jakarta's current policies and take every opportunity to reaffirm its presence in the region.

🇰🇿🇫🇷 Brief results of the return visit of the President of Ka...	🇰🇿🇫🇷 Brief results of the return visit of the President of Kazakhstan to France A little over a year after Emmanuel Macron visited the country, the time has come for Kassym-Jomart Tokayev to visit Paris. It was preceded by diplomatic preparation: the newspaper Le Figaro published an article by the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan with the headline -Kazakhstan is a strategic and reliable partner of France,- where topics for subsequent discussion were outlined. Theses regarding the growing influence of the middle powers generally repeated what Tokayev said at the Astana forum ThinkTank 2024. He called the UN a prime example of the ineffectiveness of current governance systems and international regulatory mechanisms. At the same time, the politician emphasized the growing role of Kazakhstan in peacekeeping processes and building dialogue. In fact, the country once again acts as a gateway to Eurasia and a place for establishing communications for France and the entire EU. Many analysts have already noted the strange consistency of the leaders’ meetings: soon after Tokayev’s visit to Paris, Vladimir Putin is due to arrive in Astana. Of course, cooperation between the countries will continue in the extraction of rare earth elements and ecology. In the first case, a roadmap for a bilateral strategic partnership on critical resources and materials was signed. In the second, it goes both in the field of green energy and water resources with the One Water Summit initiative, within the framework of which a joint forum of the Republic of Kazakhstan and France is expected in December. Cooperation in the field of civil nuclear energy was mentioned in the same line with renewable energy sources, since a positive decision in this area was made in Kazakhstan in October this year at a national referendum.❗️The French company EDF is on the short list of possible contractors for the construction of nuclear power plants in Kazakhstan together with CNNС (PRC), KHNP (South Korea) and Rosatom. Therefore, the mention of such cooperation by Tokayev and his meeting with the General Director of Électricité de France Luc Remont caused a storm in the Kazakh segment, where they began to assert that France would build a nuclear power plant in Kazakhstan. It’s funny that just a few days before Tokayev’s visit to Paris , a large delegation from the Ministry of Energy of Kazakhstan visited South Korea, also declaring their readiness to cooperate in the field of nuclear energy. Of interest was that turbine manufacturer Doosan was among the companies visited. This corporation was now supposed to participate in the construction of two power units at the Temelin nuclear power plant in the Czech Republic under the auspices of the already mentioned KHNP, however, with the combined efforts of the American Westinghouse and the same EDF, this prospect is becoming a little foggy, as well as the possibility of the South Korean contractor constructing a nuclear power plant in Kazakhstan. #Kazakhstan #France #Central AsiaSupport usGazeta.RuUranium and other strategic minerals.

🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦 Pokrovsko-Kurakhovskoe direction: battles in the Grig...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 Pokrovsko-Kurakhovskoe direction: fighting in the Grigorovka area and preparations for the assault on Kurakhovo Situation as of 19:00 November 8, 2024 The offensive of Russian troops in the Pokrovsko-Kurakhovskoe direction continues to develop. In the north, units of the Russian Armed Forces liberated Grigorovka and Novoalekseevka, while on the southern flank, Russian attack aircraft are confidently advancing along the northern shore of the Kurakhovskoye Reservoir. ▪️On November 3, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced the release of Vishnevoy, which confirmed the consolidation of the Russian Armed Forces in the locality. Taking advantage of the disorganization of enemy units, Russian troops broke through to Grigorovka, located northwest. The armored groups advanced along the nearby forest belt, after which they carried out a landing. The stormtroopers knocked out the Ukrainian formations from their positions in the village and, after consolidating on the occupied lines, are launching an offensive on the south-eastern outskirts of Petrovka. ▪️The capture of Vishnevoy allowed the Russian Armed Forces to launch an offensive also towards Novoalekseevka. On November 4, footage of the hoisting of the Russian flag, filmed by Russian military personnel on the eastern outskirts of the village, appeared on the Internet. In the following days, the attack aircraft completely liberated the village, pushing the Ukrainian Armed Forces back towards Yuryevka and forest belts to the west. 🔻During the successful offensive of Russian troops in the area from Grigorovka to Novoalekseevka, a wedge was formed in the position of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. For the enemy, it is dangerous with the prospect of a possible semi-encirclement of Ukrainian formations in two new areas at once: Lysovka - Petrivka and Novoalekseevka - Zarya. ▪️On November 7, the Ministry of Defense announced the liberation of Kremennaya Balka west of Tsukurino, which was later also confirmed by information from the field. Despite enemy resistance, the Russian Armed Forces pushed through the defenses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces north of the village, which made its liberation a matter of time. ▪️To the south, the Russian Armed Forces are developing an offensive along the northern shore of the Kurakhovsky reservoir. By November 6, units of the 114th Motorized Rifle Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces liberated Stepanovka and installed the banner of their unit on one of the houses in the village. After this, the assault groups, in a series of attacks, advanced to Ilyinka and started fighting on the north-eastern outskirts of the village. At the same time, the artillery of the Russian Armed Forces suppresses the firing points and positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces at strong points north and south of the settlement. ❗️Messages continue to appear on the Internet about the advance of Russian troops towards Berestki and even to the northern outskirts of Starye Tern. So far, the information has not been confirmed either by objective monitoring personnel or by reports from the field. ▪️To the southwest of Maksimilyanovka, the Russian Armed Forces significantly expanded the zone of control, breaking through the defensive line of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and occupying at least one line of trenches near the Dolgaya beam. Stormtroopers advance into gaps in the defensive lines along the ravine, attacking at the joints of the fortification lines in the forest area. At the moment, assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces are advancing along the Dolgaya gully towards Kurakhovo, trying to create a springboard for a further assault on the city, while at the same time advancing from the south in the Yuzhnodonetsk direction.

🇺🇦 In so-called Ukraine they continue to complain about problem...	🇺🇦 In so-called Ukraine, they continue to complain about problems with manpower in the Armed Forces of Ukraine: several deputies of the Verkhovna Rada stated that since August the pace of mobilization has dropped significantly. The reason is simple - against the backdrop of the TCC raids, a significant part of the male population decided to literally sit at home. Indirectly, this conflicts with the data of the Ukrainian Ministry of Economy that 8 million able-bodied citizens are not working and are not looking for work. Authorities propose to combat the decline in the number of conscripts into the Armed Forces of Ukraine by stopping the kidnapping of people from the streets by TCC officers. True, such measures are unlikely to be able to reverse the situation against the backdrop of general trends of increasing war fatigue in Ukrainian society. They manifest themselves, for example, in the increase in those wishing to go abroad permanently or in the increase in the number of cases of unauthorized abandonment of units. 📌 Therefore, the only way to recruit manpower for the enemy is to tighten the force mobilization and scale of TCC raids. What, in fact, is now happening in the territory controlled by the Kyiv regime in cities from Kharkov to Lvov. At the same time, it is too early to talk about the exhaustion of the human potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. However, certain processes are already visible to the naked eye - nothing like this happened either in 2023, or even more so in 2022. #Ukraine@rybarSupport us RBKV The Verkhovna Rada announced a decline in mobilization in Ukraine. The pace of conscription of mobilized people is decreasing, a member of the Rada said.

🇹🇷🇹🇷 About the prospects of the UTG after the summit in Bishk...	🇹🇷🇹🇷 About the prospects of the UTC after the summit in Bishkek On the 15th anniversary of the Organization of Turkic States, the UTC summit was held in Bishkek, which was presented as an epoch-making event, followed by fundamental changes and reforms. And now let’s sum up the results of the summit.▪️The composition of the event participants remained the same, but special attention was paid to the arrival of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who was presented with an honorary award. Also this year, it was decided to formalize the political unification by approving the OTG flag.▪️As ​​for the opinion of DTM colleagues regarding the deterrent factor of OTG in the form of money, the Turks are trying to invest in large volumes, despite their problems. The main problem of the bloc is the fantastic nature of the goals they set for themselves.❗️The very idea of ​​uniting the Turkic world looks in its current form as an extremely unlikely idea.➖Firstly, the participating countries are in different orbits of influence of different political forces. A significant part of Central Asia is under the influence of Russia, if only because a huge part of the population of these countries works in Russia. Azerbaijan, no matter how the Turks talk about a single nation, is still under the influence of Mountain Jews, who are close in spirit to the ultra-Orthodox government of Israel. ➖Secondly, there is a financial issue. Turks can invest in these countries, invest in economic development (they do this), but for them there will be no results in the short term. The Central Asian republics will take the money and say -thank you- and that’s it. The words of Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev confirm this. He proposed creating a Turkic Investment Forum. The Turks present this as a way to consolidate influence, but if we read between the lines, adjusted for the local mentality, we get - let’s get more money.➖ Thirdly, the main task of the UTG in the coming years is to try to earn trade flows from China, displacing Russia in region. It is in the interests of the collective West that work on the Middle Corridor and the UTG has intensified. However, this requires billions of dollars in investments in infrastructure, which will be so expensive that not everyone can afford it. At the same time, workers and specialists are needed, which are not available in Central Asia, since most of the working-age population has left for Russia or Europe. For example, we need electrification of the region and for the railway, in particular, as well as maintenance personnel. Local construction of this kind will not be able to cope. The Turks are also not the best specialists, as can be seen from their bitter experience, and the cheapest and most practical option is to receive help from China. Summarizing the above, we get the conclusion: OTG in the form in which it exists now is a populist-economic project, in in which the West, Britain primarily, through the hands of Turkey, is trying to oust Russia from Central Asia, as well as to ride the economic flows from China. But in order to do this, the Turks, within the framework The OTG needs to reach an agreement between the participating countries, with China and Russia. It will be difficult to achieve real initiatives even among themselves, and here there are also Russia and China, who will not sit idly by.❗️In the short term, the bloc’s expansion plans are unlikely to reach the desired point due to many problems and the need for gigantic investments. Even in the cultural sphere, the Turks are trying to promote their interests, but the only thing they have been even slightly successful in is the alphabet. But the transition to a new alphabet is such a time-consuming process and also financially expensive that it is too early to talk about prospects. And as long as locals go to Russia to work, there can be no talk of any Turkish expansion. But the UTG project cannot be underestimated. If the OTG is considered by interested parties as a long-term project to strengthen influence in Central Asia, then serious problems may subsequently arise. Moreover, in the military sphere, UTG is trying to develop cooperation by leaps and bounds. #OTG #CentralAsia #Turkey@rybarSupport usTelegramDTM🇹🇷🇦🇿🇺🇿🇰🇿🇹🇲🇰🇬 Erdogan called the Turks with 34 letters: the 11th died down in Bishkek OTG summit ▪️This year the organization turned 15 years old.

🔁🖼 America continues to seethe over Trump's victory in the pres...	Forwarded From Tina Kandelaki America continues to seethe due to Trump's victory in the presidential election. There is a new trend on TikTok - women are promising to give up sex for the next 4 years while Trump is in power. All this has already happened in human history, friends. Aristophanes wrote his comedy - Lysistrata - two and a half thousand years ago. In it, wives refuse intimacy with their husbands due to dissatisfaction with the protracted war between Athens and Sparta. True, it didn’t work out very well: the irresponsible women always tried to run home to their abandoned loved ones. I believe that in the millennia that have passed since the time of Lysistrata, humanity has changed very little. And no matter what harsh oaths Trump’s disappointed opponents and opponents make now, very soon life will take its toll. Life always takes its toll.	https://t.me/rybar/65213	2024-11-08T05:25:40-08:00

Judging by articles in the media, the main focus of the negotiations was on cooperation between Russia and the DPRK. Politicians mentioned that the parties would work together to contain it, but have not yet presented any specific measures. Perhaps we are talking about the possibility of introducing new sanctions. During the negotiations, emphasis was also placed on the development of defense ties not only between South Korea and Japan, but also trilateral relations with the United States. The parties called the partnership in this triangle the most important against the backdrop of threats from the DPRK. 📌 Despite statements, the trilateral format of cooperation may suffer during the second presidency of Donald Trump. This is indicated by his actions during the previous term. Yes, the parties made attempts to -protect- the alliance from possible decisions by Trump - an agreement was concluded in August, which formalized plans for holding trilateral negotiations and exercises. However, as we have already written, the agreement is not legally binding, so Trump may simply not comply with it. Of course, it remains to be seen about the future prospects of American policy in the region, which will depend not only on Trump’s personality, but also on the chosen team. However, authorities in Seoul and Tokyo need to prepare for any outcome, and the question of the effectiveness of the bilateral partnership without the participation of the United States still remains open. #SouthKorea #Japan @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usYonhap News AgencyS.

🎬 🇮🇱🇳🇱 About the night riots in Amsterdam In the capital of ...	🇮🇱🇳🇱 About night riots in Amsterdam Riots occurred in the capital of the Netherlands after a football match between Ajax and the Israeli team Maccabi. Throughout the night, Israeli citizens were beaten in the streets, attacked with knives and tried to be run over by cars. The event has already been dubbed a Jewish pogrom on the Internet. Five Israelis were taken to hospitals. The bulk of the attacks were carried out by local residents from Morocco, Turkey and other Muslim countries, who shouted pro-Palestinian slogans. Police detained more than 60 rioters, while reports of hostage-taking were not confirmed. Israel's national airline, El Al, announced the launch of free rescue flights to evacuate more than 2 thousand people, although its planes usually do not fly on Shabbat. IDF transport planes with medical personnel also flew to the Netherlands.🔻According to statements by Israeli officials and resources, this was not a spontaneous, but a well-thought-out action, planned two weeks ago. According to them, yesterday Dutch law enforcement agencies warned about the possibility of attacks, but they simply ignored it. The Internet, as expected, began to compare the unrest with the events of Kristallnacht in Nazi Germany, the anniversary of which, ironically, will be tomorrow. Israeli President Isaac Herzog demanded that the Netherlands resolutely combat any manifestations of anti-Semitism and help in the evacuation. However, the Israeli fans themselves added fuel to the fire: in Amsterdam they tore down Palestinian flags, had fun and sang -Hava Nagila- at the national monument to the victims of the Second World War . And during the match they refused to observe a minute of silence for those killed in the flood in Spain.❗️What happened is, on the one hand, another evidence of serious demographic changes in the population of large European cities. Yesterday's refugees from Muslim countries and their descendants are becoming a force that is increasingly easier to mobilize for street actions, and it is increasingly difficult for the police to counteract this. At the same time, the policies of the ultra-Orthodox Israeli authorities and their public demonstrative disregard for decisions of the UN Security Council and other international norms against the background of personnel The bombing of Lebanon and the Gaza Strip more strongly provokes some segments of the population of Western countries to such attacks. Against this background, there is no guarantee that this will not happen in other European cities in the future. #Israel #Netherlands@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/65208	2024-11-08T03:57:31-08:00

At some moments it even seemed that the British press had completely forgotten about the events taking place in their own country. First of all, such strong interest is due to economic factors - the British are afraid of the consequences of Trump's introduction of duties on the import of foreign goods. According to analysts, protectionist measures will lead to a decrease in the growth rate of the UK economy by 0.7 percent, an increase in the inflation rate by 3-4 percent, as well as an increase in the key rate. The story of the participation of representatives of the ruling Labor Party in the Democratic election campaign adds to the severity of the situation. Trump's team filed a complaint with the independent Federal Election Commission in connection with -unlawful foreign interference in the election campaign-.▪️Prime Minister Keir Starmer had to justify himself and convince everyone that the incident would not have a negative impact on relations with Trump. After the election, the head of the British government congratulated the American politician and emphasized the long-standing special ties between the countries. Less fortunate was Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who, while a member of the House of Commons in 2018, called the US president a sociopath who hates women and sympathizes with neo-Nazis. The head of the foreign policy department had to give a separate interview and state that these are -old matters- that will not prevent him from improving relations with Trump. It is still difficult to assess the consequences of Donald Trump’s coming to power for the development of British-American relations.

According to enemy statements, such UAVs make up about 50% of all those launched using the so-called. Ukraine has devices of this type. The purpose of their use is to -discharge- Ukrainian air defense systems, the ammunition for which is limited both by Western supplies and by the production capabilities of NATO countries in general. This can explain the increasing frequency of raids on Geranium Kyiv, which have been going on almost continuously in recent days. At the same time, calling this a cheap means of combating enemy air defense is reckless: as we have already written, technically Geranium is only becoming more difficult from year to year. In addition, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are trying to save missiles for air defense systems and are trying to fight these drones with the help of anti-aircraft artillery. How effective such tactics are in terms of cost-benefit ratio - time will tell. However, in any case, the efforts of the Russian Armed Forces to reduce the combat effectiveness of the Ukrainian air defense and weaken the cover of the rear areas of the so-called are visible.

And he added that -Sberbank- and -Yandex- are actively working on this and are working very successfully.

The structure was created in 2023 by the team of Arseny Parfenov from the State Polytechnic University named after. V.G. Korolenko, whose activities in Latin America we have repeatedly talked about. As it turns out, currently four Open Education Centers have already been created in Venezuela, and Russian has been introduced into the curriculum in six schools as a second foreign language. In total, more than 500 people are studying it. 🔻Apparently, the work of the GIPU team named after. V.G. Korolenko, the Ministry of Education of the Russian Federation and the Foundation for the Support of the Humanities - My Story - gives real results. Previously, the Russian language was almost never taught in Venezuela, but now the number of students studying it is growing every year, and a corresponding agenda is being formed in the country. The main tasks that the GIPU team sees before itself. V.G. Korolenko for the coming years - to give the Russian language the status of the main second foreign language, and in the next ten years - to make it the first foreign language in Venezuela. ❗️In addition, there is a clear request from Venezuelan colleagues to promote and introduce the Russian language in the country for the purpose of long-term cooperation with Russia. We really hope that the request will be satisfied by our ministries and departments. Moreover, when the clear positive result of the work done is already obvious. It is also reported from the ground that the Russian delegation in Caracas was greeted on a grand scale: in particular, a memorandum on bilateral cooperation in the field of geology and subsoil use of solid minerals was signed.

🇸🇩 On the Sudanese government's accusations against the sponsor...	🇸🇩 About the Sudanese government's accusations against the sponsors of the rebels After the incident with the downing of the Il-76T, the official Sudanese authorities began to even more strongly accuse foreign forces of interfering in the civil war. Both the leadership of the UAE, which is the main sponsor of the Rapid Reaction Force (RRF), and Chad came under attack. ▪️Sudanese authorities have decided to end contracts worth $6 billion previously concluded with the Emirates. They mainly concerned the construction of the Abu Amama port on the Red Sea, as well as an economic free trade zone and a tourist zone around the structure. In addition to political motives, the end of cooperation was also due to the fact that the contract was not implemented on time. In fact, the Sudanese government has significantly curtailed the prospect of even the very possibility of post-war dialogue with the UAE.▪️The leadership in Port Sudan also filed a complaint against Chad with the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, which belongs to the African Union. The accusations related to the support of the SBR: the downed Il-76, working in the interests of the militants, was heading directly to Chadian territory. This again shed light on helping the rebels from N'Djamena. By the way, all these proceedings open a certain window of opportunity for Russian departments that can fill the resulting vacuum in these areas. This is especially true for the project of the Navy logistics center on the Red Sea coast, which has been raised more than once.#Africa #UAE #Sudan #Chad @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇸🇩🇷🇺 About the downing of an Il-76T with a Russian crew over SudanAt 4 am on October 21, an Il-76T transport plane 76T was shot down by Sudanese rebels from the Rapid Reaction Forces, who have been waging war against the official government for the last year and a half.

In October, almost 58% of respondents were dissatisfied with Pashinyan’s work, 35.4% were dissatisfied with the work of the government, 43% of the parliament, 39% of the president.🔻Parliamentary elections In a hypothetical parliamentary election, 16.5% would vote for the ruling party -Civil Contract-, and 6.4% - Armenia bloc. 30% said that they would not participate in the elections, 33.2% refused or found it difficult to answer, or did not choose anyone. The ruling party has already begun to push through parliament odious amendments to the Electoral Code, which will allow the election results to be annulled in the event of a state of emergency or martial law being introduced. After the signing of peace with Baku, early elections will most likely follow in Armenia in a situation where society will be extremely dissatisfied with the authorities. Although a slightly larger proportion of citizens give preference to the Civil Contract, its rating is still low, and the absence of other preferences indicates a blurring of the political field. The latest protest in Armenia faced precisely the latter, which for several months has not developed a clear program.🔻Like many previous surveys, the current one shows the crisis state of the Armenian society, which is dissatisfied with the authorities, the foreign policy course, but at the same time has no other moral -political guidelines. And although the Armenian authorities self-confidently declare that the main thing is the economy, the main problem for the Armenian society remains the feeling of an external threat and it is obvious that against such a background, Pashinyan’s peace-loving policy does not inspire confidence.

Ukraine and Moldova? The majority (52%) believe that this is impossible, and 35% believe that Armenia has a chance. Since the summer, the idea of ​​European integration began to periodically appear on the Armenian agenda, and now the issue of holding a constitutional referendum on joining the EU is being considered. Mythical European promises in the context of internal political problems and diplomatic failures are the only thing that Nikol Pashinyan’s government can now offer to the population of Armenia. So far, the EU has limited itself to just starting negotiations on visa liberalization, which reinforces false promises. After all, the problem with the hypothetical European integration of Armenia is that it is impossible without Georgia, which, as we know, has had pretty bad relations with the EU.🔻Modernization or closure of nuclear power plants The Armenians were asked a pressing question about the country’s energy security: what should the government do in the field of nuclear energy?&nbsp ; The first option is to modernize the existing nuclear power plant by 2036. The second is to close the nuclear power plant and build American modular nuclear reactors. 63.7% were in favor of modernizing the Armenian nuclear power plant, which is maintained by the Russian Rosatom, and 25.5% were in favor of closing it and implementing the American project. As we wrote, the United States is trying to sell Armenia a non-existent project of new small modular reactors. The Americans themselves have not yet developed a working SMR technology, and their similar projects have failed miserably. At the same time, Armenia is critically tied to nuclear energy and Russian specialists, and the United States itself admits that their goal is the final severance of Armenian-Russian ties. Yet a quarter of those surveyed already believe in US nuclear energy marketing communications, and with an additional information campaign the numbers could rise.&nbsp;&nbsp; High resolution infographicsEnglish version#Armenia #Russia #USA&nbsp; @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇦🇲🇪🇺 In Armenia, they decided to rehabilitate the idea of ​​holding a referendum on joining the EU. ▪️The authorities came up with such an initiative back in June, but public opinion received it ambiguously, after which Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan declared it inappropriate...	https://t.me/rybar/65198	2024-11-07T22:45:09-08:00

The government of Armenia constantly states that they are ready to sign -peace- even now, especially with this They are constantly rushing to the USA. However, a tense information background remains between Yerevan and Baku, which looks more like preparation for another escalation than a movement towards -peace-. So the disbelief of the Armenian society in the promises of normalization is quite understandable. The other day, the Russian Foreign Ministry just stated that the -quick peace- promoted by Western pseudo-mediators will not lead to anything good, but will only create new risks of tension. 🔻Concessions to Azerbaijan and Turkey When asked whether Armenia should make new concessions to establish closer relations with Azerbaijan and Turkey, 90% answered - no, we have nothing more to concede - and only 7% believe that the country has no other choice .The level of Turkophobia in society is invariably high and it is impossible to imagine a calm attitude towards concessions in the name of -normalization-. Moreover, Baku and Ankara themselves are not ready to compromise and view Armenia as a losing side that can be presented with new demands and threatened with force. The Armenian Foreign Ministry has even stated that they refuse to promote recognition of the Armenian Genocide, which generally damages the identity of Armenians and threatens the security of the nation. 🔻Refusal of the Declaration of Independence When asked about their attitude to the decision of the Constitutional Court, which ruled that the reference in the Constitution to the Declaration of Independence, which mentions Artsakh, was incompetent, 72.8% expressed a negative opinion. With this decision, the Constitutional Court of Armenia made a concession to Baku, where they demand to change the Armenian Constitution , without which they consider concluding peace -impossible-.🔻The main problems of Armenia 76.2% indicated security and border issues as the most pressing problem of Armenia. Only 19.4% noted the importance of political stability, 16.4% - issues of economic development, 9.6% - employment and social issues. Public anxiety about the security of the state indicates a real feeling of insecurity before an external enemy. Even if a formal -peace- with Azerbaijan is signed and the border with Turkey is opened, it is unlikely that public anxiety will subside, and enemies will suddenly become allies for the sake of unclear -prosperity-.

🇦🇿🇷🇺 Repressions against public loyal to Russia continue in A...	🇦🇿🇷🇺 Repressions against public figures loyal to Russia continue in Azerbaijan: a local court sentenced political scientist Nazaket Mamedova to 13 years in prison. She was accused of high treason and even collaboration with Russian intelligence services. As they write in the Azerbaijani media, according to the materials of the criminal case, Mamedova allegedly carried out secret activities under the guise of a political scientist and journalist, publishing pro-Russian materials on the Alfa TV YouTube channel. 🔻The indictment contains information about Mamedova’s trips to Moscow, where she allegedly participated in meetings with representatives of Russian intelligence services and received money transfers. The woman denies this and points out that she visited Russia to participate in conferences, and the funds were fees and travel expenses. Indeed, she quite openly participated in conferences in the Russian Federation: for example, in 2021, a political scientist gave a report on the role of Western NGOs in Azerbaijan. At the same time, Mamedova has always been a supporter of Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, and also supported Russia in the so-called conflict. Ukraine and advocated strengthening Russian-Azerbaijani relations. ❗️At the same time, Mamedova was detained back in October 2023, but for a year no public actions were taken by the Russian side to protect her. The situation is similar with other pro-Russian social activists - Ibragim Hasanov and Ibragim Gumbatov. Given the external friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation of Russia and Azerbaijan, it is obvious that anti-Russian tendencies are growing in the former post-Soviet republic, where even active support of relations with the Russian Federation is already punishable by extremely serious prison terms. And Azerbaijani figures loyal to Russia will now have less desire to cooperate with Russian organizations. #Azerbaijan #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇦🇿🇷🇺 Turansky Express reports that social activists loyal to Russia are being repressed in Azerbaijan again.

Finnish media say that the Americans are planning to modernize the Finnish Pirkkala airbase in order to redeploy their RQ-4B drones there in the future. If the appearance of Finnish F-35s is not there I rule out that -Global Hokov- is unlikely. The point of these machines is that they can fly great distances and fly for more than a day, and then return to the airbase of departure. That is, for them, proximity to the destination area is not so important, but safety is another matter. They are not as maneuverable as fighters, and in the event of an attack on an airfield that is a couple of hundred kilometers away, they simply will not have time to take off. In summary, their basing in Finland seems illogical. Or maybe it’s in Norway, where, by the way, the discussions are more serious and there is logic in this due to the height of the struggle in the Arctic and the possibility of longer-term monitoring of the north of Russia.

In this regard, Fakuyama's concept of the -end of history- is a fallacy. ▪️There is a conflict between the majority of the planet’s population and the world’s minority.▪️The West is hypocritically trying to convince us that everything built after World War II is under threat, but what is actually under threat is the Western monopoly. Western policy is aimed not at creation, but at retention.▪️It is important not to repeat the mistakes of the end of the last century, when the West tried to impose a vicious concept of exiting the Cold War.▪️Openness of interaction is the most important value of most countries and peoples, and interruption of ties harms the economy and is dangerous in an era of upheaval.▪️The international community is a living organism, the value of which lies in its civilizational diversity.▪️NATO is the only bloc left in the world and is an outright anachronism.▪️NATO has those who show interest in BRICS, perhaps the number of such countries will grow .▪️BRICS itself is a prototype of the new, free and non-bloc nature of relations between countries. ▪️The West brought the situation to a coup in Ukraine and forced Russia to launch a special operation. In this sense, he achieved what he wanted.▪️Developed countries are faced with an increasingly less controlled flow of migration, this provokes the growth of xenophobia.▪️NATO's expansion to the East began to look like a creeping intervention aimed at destroying Russia.▪️Russia has never been the initiator of the use of force, but when necessary, we will take all measures to protect the country.▪️Russia has more than once stopped those who were striving for world domination, and it will continue to be so.▪️The very existence of Russia is the key to the successful development of the world.▪️Russia today is fighting for its freedom, its rights , your sovereignty.

Since October 31, strikes have become a daily occurrence, as have confrontations with the police.▪️Amid reports of clashes with law enforcement agencies across the country, the Mozambican defense minister has already threatened to use the armed forces. At the same time, the authorities have already increased the security of administrative buildings. It is worth noting that so far the protesters are not holding mass demonstrations, but for the most part gather in groups to destroy the infrastructure. All this is reminiscent of the Kenyan scenario already tested by the Americans.▪️The lack of centralization of the protests gives rise to spontaneous pogroms. Thus, along the border with South Africa, demonstrators burned several trucks with goods. This was followed by the closure of the Lebombo checkpoint on the South African side and the cessation of land trade between the countries.🔻Thus, the protesters seek to create economic leverage on the current authorities. Earlier, the opposition planned a march on the capital Maputo on November 7. At the same time, it is doubtful that the action will be successful, provided that the military personnel have already been mobilized.

Forwarded From Two MajorsUkrainian military personnel use training abroad as a way to legally escape from the country From the report of the head of the SBU Malyuk, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Syrsky learned that in September and early October of this year alone, 43 cases of unauthorized abandonment of units by Ukrainian military personnel while undergoing training abroad were recorded. Indicated countries: 🇵🇱 Poland, 🇪🇸 Spain and 🇫🇷 France. In general, since the beginning of the year, the SBU officers have recorded over 230 such cases. The SBU informed the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine three times about this problem. However, the number of unauthorized leaving of units abroad by soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine not only has not decreased, but on the contrary, the number of facts of Ukrainian citizens using the reason to mobilize with the prospect of going abroad for training for further flight is increasing. According to the SBU, this problem negatively affects the international image of the Ukrainian army and the allies help. To solve the problem, the Ukrainian special service proposes to increase the level of military discipline in the troops, and also promises to provide the necessary assistance in preventing the escape of Ukrainian military personnel from the country.✨ Note that not all forcibly mobilized Ukrainians have the honor of going to study military affairs for border.

This was reported by the press service of the ministry. The goal is assistance in matters of protecting rights and interests, taking measures to prevent crimes, and preventing illegal actions on the part of compatriots. According to the press service, during a meeting of the representative office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Kyrgyz Republic in the Russian Federation and the leadership of the International Cooperation Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, issues of interaction between departments and struggle with crime, the prevention of drug crime, the involvement of citizens in drug trafficking, especially youth. This example demonstrates a more or less practical approach on the part of our Central Asian partner. It is important for the Kyrgyz leadership to send workers to work in Russia for various reasons and they are interested in stabilizing the migration situation, which is why they are trying to calm down their citizens abroad. Unlike other countries in Central Asia, which only call on the Russian side to take measures to respect the rights of migrants, but at the same time they do nothing themselves, this approach theoretically looks promising. But for now we will observe how the process of their work will be organized, since until the result is visible, there is no point in discussing this seriously. in matters of protecting rights and interests and preventing illegal actions on the part of compatriots.	https://t.me/rybar/65179	2024-11-07T08:45:26-08:00

Previously, a memorandum of interaction and cooperation with the FNTT was signed, providing for the exchange of experience in areas of protecting the rights and interests of employees, the development of social partnership and public control, employment policy and the fight against unemployment. As noted, among the forms of cooperation are the organization of recreation and health improvement for trade union members and members of their families on preferential terms, but this is where the details end . One can hope that this agreement will allow Ural workers to relax at resorts, as indicated in the conditions, but there is a big nuance. The Sverdlovsk region has managed to mark itself as a forward point for migrants from Tajikistan, where initiatives have previously been put forward such as opening hospitals exclusively for migrants. Considering that regional authorities are particularly supportive of migrants, even going to the extent of threatening veterans of the Northern Military District, this is not surprising. Therefore, there are certain doubts that everything will be done as it is written on paper. Lobbying the interests of foreign workers and assisting in the preparation of false documents is also prohibited legally, but some officials at the local level neglect these norms. So, behind seemingly insignificant news, more serious processes may be hidden: gradual penetration into Russian institutional structures to use their funds and resources for their own purposes, and, most importantly, improving conditions for Central Asian migrants. #multinationalism #Russia #CentralAsia #Tajikistan@rybarSupport usSputnik TajikistanA medical center for citizens of Tajikistan may appear in Yekaterinburg.

Organization, (and the second one too) does not function in the form in which we would like, and reforms began to suggest themselves several years ago, and in recent years the situation has worsened, which was influenced by the course of the North Military District and individual member countries.❗️Reorganization of the CSTO or even its reformatting is vital. Revision of agreements between participants, conclusion of stronger ties with allies. There should be comprehensive agreements between members of this kind of organization, similar to those concluded with the DPRK and even more. When revising the structure of the CSTO, special attention should be paid to the legal nuances and obligations of the parties. In the future there should be no situations like with Armenia or Kazakhstan.

🇩🇪 About the collapse of the traffic light coalition in Germany...	🇩🇪 About the collapse of the traffic light coalition in Germany Recently, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, as he himself put it, decided to prove Germany’s reliability to the newly elected US President. But this was manifested not in measures to strengthen the economy, but in the dismissal of Finance Minister Christian Lindner on charges of problems with government spending. The departure of the politician, a member of the Free Democratic Party of Germany, provoked other members of the organization to follow his example: after Lindner, the ministers of transport left the government, justice and education. The traffic light coalition lost its yellow light, which led to its virtual collapse. The main reason for the disagreement was Lindner’s proposals to improve the economy, including reducing the costs of solving environmental problems and increasing the operating time of coal plants. However, this categorically did not suit the colleagues of the head of the Ministry of Finance from the Social Democratic Party and the Greens. What will happen next? For now, Scholz is talking about his intention to organize a vote of confidence in the government on January 15, which could lead to early elections in March. However, this week the government must formulate a draft state budget for the 2025 fiscal year, and voting on it will take place by the end of November. If the document is approved in the Bundestag, then Scholz may remain in power until the next elections in 2025. 📌 Most likely, now the red-green remnants of the traffic light will stall for time and avoid any steps that would contradict all their previous activities. No matter who sits in the White House, the tasks assigned to the German government will remain the same - to systematically destroy the German economy. Therefore, it is too early to expect any noticeable changes in German politics.#Germany@rybar together with @Ubersicht_Ukraine_KanalSupport usTelegramÜbersicht Ukraine💥💥FDP-Minister ziehen sich komplett aus Ampel-Regierung zurück😀Die FDP zieht alle ihre Minister aus der deutschen Bundesregierung z urück.

Ukraine often goes through the prism of the likelihood of a reduction in military supplies. However, now the Kiev regime is facing serious socio-demographic problems. Recently, news about an abnormal increase in the number of school graduates who do not want to take final exams went viral in the Ukrainian media field. In some classes, the number of such students is about 90% of the students, and this applies not only to boys, but also to girls. The reason is the conscious intention to go abroad immediately after graduation. According to representatives of the local education system, this does not come from a simple desire to study at a foreign university, but from a desire not to be associated with the so-called. Ukraine in general.📌 Against this background, one can recall official data according to which, without the annual import of hundreds of thousands of migrants, it is impossible even to simply maintain the Ukrainian population at the level of 30 million people. With the outflow of young people, demographic prospects are becoming even worse. The likelihood of a reversal of these negative trends seems minimal - so-called depopulation. Ukraine was going strong even without any war, and now these processes are only getting worse, and Western military support indirectly contributes to this. The Kiev regime may receive new supplies of ammunition and equipment, but no one will give them people. Therefore, the future of the Ukrainian territorial entity itself looks vague, and with every day of fighting it only gets worse. #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTACCmedia: many parents intend to take their children out of Ukraine.

The agreement was signed during a meeting between the head of the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Innovation of Uzbekistan, Kogratbay Sharipov, and the head of the University of Tsukuba, Nagata Kyosuke. The training programs will be built according to Japanese standards. At the moment, the parties have agreed to create a working group that will prepare a feasibility study. The creation of a new international university is part of a comprehensive reform of the higher education system launched by President Shavkat Mirziyoyev. It affects 116 universities in Uzbekistan and involves their consolidation, revision of statuses and optimization of directions training bachelors with a reduction in the number of programs by 40%.🔻The benefits for Uzbekistan are clear, but why is Tokyo? Firstly, Japan has serious problems with demography, and, therefore, with the workforce. They are making attempts to eliminate its deficit through training abroad (and which has every chance of being cheaper). Secondly, we have already written that Washington is optimizing soft power, shifting its provision to its satellites.

On October 24-25, the delegation of the Kyrgyz Republic held a meeting with the leadership of the Directorate General for Mobility and Transport of the European Commission (DG Move EU). The Kyrgyz delegation was headed by the acting director of the State Agency of Civil Aviation, Daniyar Bostonov. Bostonov presented a report on the implementation of new programs, training of inspectors and updating of aviation infrastructure, which was highly praised by Brussels. Bishkek has been trying to solve the problem with the work of its airlines in Europe since 2006. Then European inspectors came to the conclusion that air transportation in the republic does not meet EU standards.&nbsp;Since 2006, the price of the issue has also changed, given that after mutual bans between Russia and the EU on the use of their airspace, trans-Eurasian traffic and its services have shifted to Central Asia . 🔻And therefore Bishkek is extremely interested in a successful audit in order to follow the example of its Kazakh colleagues, who are hoping to single-handedly skim off all the cream from servicing volume traffic. And perhaps based on this, assistance in processing documents for Bishkek, according to Bostonov, is provided by the UK Civil Aviation Agency: you should not put all your eggs in one basket. #Kyrgyzstan #EU #Great Britain #CentralAsia@rybar Support usAkchabarThere is progress.

This visit is a reminder to the leadership in Nouakchott that they are considered in Washington by their allies. And participation in American exercises in the Mediterranean shows that part of the Mauritanian military circles are not against cooperation with the States. At the same time, the Mauritanian authorities also continue to participate in other events and projects, including those related to interaction with Russia and China.

The head of the EBRD said that the Bank is carefully studying investment projects in Kazakhstan and expressed interest in further supporting infrastructure development. In the coming years, the EBRD plans to invest 2 billion euros in the economy of Kazakhstan as part of the implementation of the green transition program - of course, through lending, although this is precisely what they try not to mention in press releases. The wording chosen is as vague as possible: for example, this year the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is investing $650 million in the implementation of 22 projects in Kazakhstan. It is noteworthy that shortly before the negotiations between Tokayev and Reno-Basso, the Regional Forum - Green Economy - 2024 was held in Bishkek -, which appropriately prepared the ground for further interaction along this line. The President of Kazakhstan talks a lot about the need to develop green energy in region, however, it is important to understand that RES is not only an economic, but also a political project of Western countries, and the Bank itself may add additional requirements or unspoken conditions to the loan repayment, for example, the selection of certain contractors.#Kazakhstan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usVecher.kz - Evening AlmatyThe EBRD intends to invest two billion euros in the economy of Kazakhstan.

Forwarded From DTM🇹🇷 Turkish project: Great Turan and United Circassia▪️The summit of the Organization of Turkic States (OTS) opened in Bishkek. The undisputed leader of the association is Türkiye, which has brought together five post-Soviet republics under its wing: Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, which is listed as an observer in the UTG. There, in the observers, are Hungary and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, recognized only by Ankara.▪️In fact, Turkey is drawing into its orbit almost the same number of republics that were part of the USSR as the European Union (Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia are already in the EU, Moldova, Georgia and Ukraine are candidates). At the same time, the scope of neo-Ottoman ambitions extends far beyond the borders of the territories of the UTC member countries, forming the so-called Turkic world outside the framework of the political matrix of Eurasia.▪️To implement this essentially imperial project, Ankara is ready to go literally for anything. Including the cultivation of interethnic hatred under the pretext of bringing Turkic peoples closer together. Ankara's work on the topic of Uyghurs living in China is clear proof of this. By the way, Ankara uses OTG structures to process representatives of this Turkic people in Central Asia.▪️If someone, looking at such games, continues to believe that Turkey really cares about some foreign brothers, and does not use them to solve its geopolitical problems, then another example for you.▪️On the map of the Turkic world there is a blank spot - Russian territories from the Black Sea coast to the borders of Dagestan, Chechnya, Ingushetia and North Ossetia. Separatists from the extremist organization Council of United Circassia consider these 190 thousand square kilometers of the Southern and North Caucasus federal districts to be a kind of independent state that must be separated from Russia. Actually, Circassia. What does Turkey have to do with it?▪️Ankara is here despite the fact that it essentially doesn’t care whether the Turkic brothers are being attacked by the Chinese authorities or whether this hodgepodge of terrorists, Ukrainian Nazis and experts from the CIA-controlled Jamestown Foundation is drowning for the split of Russia. If the topic is in line with the national interests of Ankara, the Turks are in business.▪️Last ​​year, for example, those same terrorists, Nazis and intelligence officers under the flag of the Council of United Circassia gathered not just anywhere, but in the Youth Center of Istanbul's Üsküdar district to discuss the prospects for education independent state of the Circassian people. That is, the site was provided by a municipality under the control of Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party. Not bad, right?▪️ Let’s add here that the collector of Turkic lands Erdogan himself is not averse to turning the nationalist pedal. In 2020, the head of the Turkish Republic expressed sympathy for the Russian Circassians expelled from their homeland.▪️ It is noteworthy that, in the spirit of anti-Russian hype, the first international Circassian-Istanbul conference in 2023 was held in person. This year, Ankara apparently decided to hide its ears and the website of the extremist organization reports that the meeting scheduled for the end of November will be held online... because the participants are in different countries. Observing the intensity with which Turkey is involving its Turkic partners in its geopolitical games, the question arises: are the UTC countries ready to share Ankara’s approaches to solving foreign policy problems? @dntreadonme	https://t.me/rybar/65166	2024-11-06T23:47:02-08:00

On November 6, the country's authorities approved the purchase of 40 fast patrol boats. The need to acquire new equipment is justified by frequent clashes between the Philippine Coast Guard and Chinese law enforcement. During the incidents, the Chinese cause enormous damage to the agency's ships, which affects the Philippines' capabilities in the South China Sea. 🔻By the way, Manila will receive new boats thanks to financial assistance from France. The Philippine authorities will most likely conclude a defense agreement with this country, as we wrote about back in July of this year. Thus, Paris is paying the price for plans to expand influence in the Asia-Pacific region. In addition to the French, Americans continue to participate in sponsoring Philippine initiatives. Recently, the United States announced another $100 million in financial assistance to Manila, which will be used to modernize old military equipment or purchase new ones. Such support for the Philippines is a logical step in the confrontation with China in the region. After all, arming allies and making sure they can cause problems for Beijing is a favorite move of Western politicians. #USA #Philippines #France @rybar with @awaken_dragonSupport usGMA News OnlineNEDA Board OKs acquisition of fast patrol craftThe National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Board approved the acquisition of 40 units of fast patrol craft.	https://t.me/rybar/65165	2024-11-06T23:11:01-08:00

It became truly historic, because despite the doubts of analysts, the results of polls and the self-confidence of Democrats, Donald Trump finally regained the White House. The triumphant return of the now 47th President of the United States was possible thanks to several key factors, the most important of which, rather, In all, it was the economy, protest voting, Trump’s successful media campaigns, Americans’ fatigue with foreign conflicts and, of course, the support of Elon Musk. The latter, by the way, made an almost decisive contribution to the victory of the MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement, turning the former Twitter into a platform for advertising the Republican Party and creating a clear association in people’s minds - Trump - progress - the future -. The Democrats suffered a crushing defeat — Trump’s gap from Kamala Harris in electoral votes and in the total number of Americans who voted turned out to be so great that speculating on the topic of a -stolen election- and trying to organize a Maidan turned out to be simply impossible and pointless. As Trump said -Too big to rig-. The democrats were led to a disastrous result by the leapfrog with candidates and their frankly poor choice, chaos at the borders, the outbreak of foreign conflicts, as well as the lack of something that could be offered to the population other than permission to have abortions. Now While the public is waiting to see whether the Republicans will take the House of Representatives in addition to the Senate, a discussion has erupted in the Russian segment of the Internet about whether Trump’s victory is worth rejoicing at. Frankly, neither Harris nor Trump are candidates convenient for Russia. The future president has already made it clear that he intends to appoint representatives of various large investment and financial giants, including J.P. Morgan and Blackrock, to key positions - which is why there will not be any fundamental change in Russian-American relations. At the same time, Russian diplomacy under Trump may still have some room for maneuver; in the next six months, it will most likely become clear whether this is really the case.

In early November, Turkish troops began three exercises in different branches of the military at once.▪️The Anatolian Eagle Air Force exercise is taking place over the territory of central and southern Turkey from November 4 to 11, which is aimed at assessing the readiness of aviation to conduct high-intensity conflicts. Fighter aircraft participate in it F-16, AWACS aircraft, helicopters and tankers, and among the tasks being practiced will be the removal of aircraft from attack, air combat, precision weapons strikes with coordination with AWACS.▪️Simultaneously with this exercise, training began with NATO - Mavi Balina, the target which is to test the use of aviation and naval personnel of the Turkish and NATO Navy against threats from the sea. The main emphasis is on anti-submarine defense, reconnaissance through the installation of hydrobuoys and sonar stations, as well as countering BECs. In addition to Turkey, Canadians, Spaniards, Greeks and Portuguese are participating.▪️The Poseidon mine sweeping force exercise has begun in the Black Sea, aimed at coordinating the actions of a new mine action task force consisting of minesweepers from the Navy of Bulgaria, Turkey and Romania.❗️Curiously, that the start of the training coincided with the emergence of rumors about an upcoming attack by the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Blue Stream and the oil and gas infrastructure used in the interests of this gas pipeline.

At the opening ceremony, it was noted that the seminar is a special professional training program for media personnel. It was stated that a platform for exchange and cooperation in the field of media will be created, which will also contribute to in-depth cooperation between parties in this field. Particular attention will be paid to the implementation of decisions reached by the heads of state of China and Central Asia, and new features of modern international broadcasting. The processes of comprehensive gradual - development - of the region by Western media, including both official broadcasting and the creation of networks of bloggers, obviously could not go unnoticed in Beijing. Considering the strategic importance of Central Asia, the PRC decided not to wait for its consequences and took the initiative themselves. It should be expected that China will work to improve the quality of coverage of existing projects, that is, not pursuing some kind of aggressive anti-Western line, but demonstrating the specific benefits of cooperation with its eastern neighbor. In addition, adjustments in Chinese soft power policy in Central Asia have long been overdue. And this work of the Chinese in the Central Asian direction should alert not only Western countries, but also Russia, since, as the experience of the Celestial Empire shows, this is not about the struggle for the attention of Central Asian capitals or altruistic assistance to countries, but about leveling specific geopolitical threats and strengthening its influence .#China #Kazakhstan #Uzbekistan #Tajikistan #Turkmenistan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport uskhovar.tjA seminar for news staff and journalists from Central Asian countries began in Beijing | NIAT -Khovar-	https://t.me/rybar/65156	2024-11-06T08:44:01-08:00

I’ve known the guys for a long time because of their products and their work at the front. The founder and director of the plant, Vladimir Tkachuk, met. At the entrance they immediately gave us slippers, warning us that our place was clean. Despite the modest size of the premises, a full production cycle has been established, from the design bureau to technical control. Two workshops are operating, another one is being prepared. Clean, bright, good ventilation, nothing superfluous. The story of Vladimir and his comrades is an illustrative example of the development of volunteer initiative. The idea of ​​​​creating a Ural drone began with a group of volunteers who collected and transported humanitarian supplies to the Northern Military District zone. There the guys saw an acute shortage of drones and decided to act. Thus, relying on the personal funds and enthusiasm of the participants, a unique production was launched. During the discussion, many questions were raised - the need for continuous modernization of drones, tactics of use, promising models. Manufacturers complained about the need for more active involvement of technical universities in the training of specialists. Vladimir detailed the need to review the tax burden on small enterprises producing UAVs. I promised the guys that we would study the issue and come back with suggestions. Obviously, systemic solutions are needed here. We agreed on the exchange of experience and generally broad cooperation between UralDronZavod and the Republican Center for Unmanned Systems (RCBS). We will begin work immediately. Finally, the guys showed me my own video with gratitude for humanitarian aid, which I recorded in 1922. Even then, the Ural volunteers helped Sparta, for which I am very grateful to them. I would like to thank everyone involved in the production. Once again I see an example of service when even ordinary factory workers do not finish their shift at 18:00, staying until late to collect as many drones as possible. This attitude towards the country and the guys at the front is worth a lot.	https://t.me/rybar/65150	2024-11-06T08:12:38-08:00

The action was stopped under pressure from South Korean citizens, as well as the authorities of Gyeonggi Province, who recently banned the sending of leaflets from several areas.🔻By the way, it is the local residents who are suffering the most due to the ongoing psychological war. On the DPRK side, since the summer of this year, loudspeakers have been turned on, from which sounds can be heard that disturb citizens. The possibility of North Korea attacking leaflet launch sites has also not been canceled. Activists have already said they will next use drones to send propaganda materials. Let us recall that the flight of drones over the DPRK last month caused a very negative reaction from Pyongyang. The official position of the authorities in Seoul, who do not plan to interfere with the activities of South Korean activists, also adds fuel to the fire. So, it seems that even after the protests and measures taken by regional politicians, the issue of sending leaflets to the DPRK remains unresolved. This means that the psychological war on the peninsula that has been going on since the spring of this year is far from over. #DPRK #SouthKorea@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport uskoreatimesBorder residents block attempt to send anti-regime leaflets to North Korea the North Korean regime across the inter-Korean border were thwarted, Thursday, by hundreds of residents and local officials who feared retaliatory actions from Pyongyang.	https://t.me/rybar/65149	2024-11-06T07:46:01-08:00

Implementation of the agreement will begin in 2025, when the first workers will be able to officially find employment in Korean companies. The memorandum provides for the simplification of requirements for services involved in organizing the hiring of labor and the development of professional training programs. Taking into account the high requirements of the Korean side for language training and professional skills, the Ministry of Labor of Tajikistan organized specialized Korean language courses on the basis of government institutions, where training in demanded specialties is also provided .🔻Judging by this agreement, Dushanbe hopes to take advantage of the experience of its Uzbek neighbors, whose citizens have been working in the Republic of Kazakhstan for a long time. Thus, almost 100 thousand citizens of Uzbekistan will soon work in South Korea. At the same time, Seoul’s requirements for the qualifications of migrants are quite serious. And such conditions from Seoul are quite understandable: the South Korean authorities need cheap labor, but they are doing everything to ensure that neither the leadership nor the citizens of the republic subsequently have any problems. Therefore, they discuss in advance all the requirements to which the Tajiks, and not South Korea, adapt.

The other day it became known that the United States became the 21st country to support Uzbekistan’s entry into the World Trade Organization. Bilateral negotiations lasted more than a year. The parties are now preparing to sign a protocol on market access. In September, Uzbekistan completed negotiations on accession to the WTO with 18 countries. Protocols were signed with Brazil and Sri Lanka on the completion of negotiations on market access. The epic with accession to the WTO has been going on in Uzbekistan for quite a long time. Tashkent wants to complete the process by 2026, and the World Bank promises that the economy after accession will grow by 17% over the next 5-7 years. 🔻It is surprising that in Uzbekistan they believe such promises and stubbornly ignore both the trends towards the division of the global economy and criticism of the experience of WTO membership, which, as it turned out long ago, does not prevent unilateral restrictions in any way (Vladimir Putin has long spoken about the need to restart the organization, which , let's be honest, it's unlikely to happen). At the same time, Tashkent does not have much interest in expanding cooperation with the EAEU, where they will have a better chance of not turning into a market for mirrors and beads, but of saving their own leading industries. This suggests that Uzbekistan has set priorities in the development of economic cooperation, and Russia is clearly not in first place there. to the World Trade Organization. -14 months of active negotiations have reached their logical conclusion!

Forwarded From Two Majors ⚡️NATO has launched five initiatives to strengthen cooperation On the eve of Trump's election as president, NATO countries are concerned about increasing their capabilities, subject to a reduction in US 🇺🇸 aid to the alliance. In October 2024, an agreement was reached on the development of five areas of combat capabilities of the participating countries: ◾️Accelerating the supply of new generation remotely controlled aircraft systems similar to the NATO Ground Surveillance System. The AGS consists of five RQ-4D UAVs and associated European Ground Command and Control Posts.◾️Increasing the interchangeability and compatibility of key artillery munitions among alliance member countries. ◾️Increasing the scale of virtual training for multinational groups within the framework of the project -Educational environment for distributed integrated learning-. It is planned to create a network of advanced and immersive (training in an artificially simulated environment) multinational training courses for the military. ◾️Development of military space technologies. As part of the NORTHLINK project 🇭🇺Hungary, 🇩🇪Germany, 🇩🇰Denmark, 🇮🇸Iceland, 🇮🇹Italy, 🇨🇦Canada, 🇱🇺Luxembourg, 🇳🇱Netherlands, 🇳 🇴Norway, 🇺🇸USA, 🇫🇮Finland, 🇫🇷 France and 🇸🇪Sweden will create stable and reliable satellite communications in the Arctic. In addition, within the framework of the STARLIFT project, 14 countries will create a reserve of satellite vehicles (on Earth and in space) and a mechanism for providing accelerated access to their launch and operation to participants in need, as well as urgent access to data from commercial satellites.◾️Replacement of old helicopters, service life which expires in 2025. As part of the project -Rotor-wing aircraft of the future - 🇩🇪Germany, 🇮🇹Italy, 🇳🇱Netherlands, 🇬🇧Britain and 🇫🇷France must decide on the concept of new helicopters for their troops by the end of 2027 and begin producing them by 2030.✨ Such initiatives reveal the alliance’s problems with the European NATO countries’ lack of modern air- and space-based reconnaissance assets, information processing centers, quantity of ammunition and their variety. In addition, the enemy’s priority strategic direction in the future will be the Arctic region, and not Ukraine, which is what the bully wars are counting on.✨⭐️Despite the possible decrease in US participation in financing the capabilities of NATO countries on the European continent (Trump’s statements), this country will remain the leader of the alliance and will be the hands of European participants to counteract Russia.

This week, sailors of the two countries are conducting the first bilateral exercise - Orruda 2024 - in the Java Sea and the naval base in the city of Surabaya. ▪️Training includes artillery firing, rescue operations in water areas, anti-terrorist operations, as well as screening activities. The Russian side has already expressed hope for holding such exercises several times a year. ▪️The trainings currently taking place are the fruit of Russian-Indonesian cooperation, which has recently received close attention. Let us recall that on July 31, the elected President of Indonesia, Prabowo Subianto, was in Moscow on a visit, during which partnership in the defense sector was discussed. 🔻The authorities in Jakarta are very interested in developing ties with Moscow. According to its chosen foreign policy, based on the principle of non-alignment, Indonesia needs to maintain contacts with all powers. Particular attention is paid to those who have the greatest weight in the international arena. For Jakarta, developing defense cooperation with Moscow is a method of maintaining balance in foreign policy. By the way, simultaneously with the Orruda 2024 exercise, the Indonesian military is conducting training with another important defense partner in the person of Australia. And although the media reports that Indonesia is now pursuing a course of active interaction with Russia are correct, there is still a slight nuance in the policy of the local authorities, because in Jakarta they strive to cooperate with all major powers, and not just with the Russian Federation. Moscow is taking advantage of the opportune moment and laying the foundation for further defense partnership, which is good news.

Let us remind you that the shadow fleet of the Russian Federation, according to estimates from various media, exceeds 1000 ships, and is constantly growing. Therefore, sanctions against Russian courts do not yet look critical. What is happening must be taken in the context of the current election cycle in Britain and the state of its economy. But we need to clearly understand the systematic approach of the British authorities to solving the problem. At the European Political Community summit in July 2024, the British Prime Minister announced a call to action against the shadow fleet. To date, 47 countries have joined this initiative. Of course, the majority of countries are vassals from the EU, but there is an attempt to scale the British initiative using third-party resources, which is the hallmark of Britain.

From November 4 to 12, the Grand African Nemo exercise is taking place in the exclusive maritime zone of the west coast of Africa from Senegal to Angola. In total, 3 thousand military personnel from 28 countries are involved in it. Also involved are 55 surface ships from these 28 countries (mainly coast guards), 12 aircraft and helicopters, including: two Falcon.50M patrol aircraft, a landing helicopter dock ship -Dixmud- French Navy and multi-purpose ship -Elephant- Namibian Navy. It takes place annually under the auspices of the French Navy as part of the declared fight against piracy and smuggling, and the goal itself is to strengthen cooperation between the countries of the Gulf of Guinea in countering criminal groups.🔻But how do you Remember very well that for the French this part of Africa was historically a zone of traditional influence, from where the Americans and the Chinese gradually began to oust the Fifth Republic. Therefore, for Paris, the importance of maintaining the current format of the exercises is high. None of the European countries in the region is trying to really teach African sailors anything (they don’t really need it either). If France or the United States wanted to deal with the problem of illegal traffic by sea or piracy, then this would have been done long ago. But as long as there are such problems, there is also a reason to maintain a military presence in the regions of interest. And in this regard, the situation is very similar to the Caribbean, where there are the French, the USA, and Britain. There are also regular exercises with local countries like Tradewinds, but they are of no use.High resolution mapEnglish version#Africa #France@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65137	2024-11-06T02:45:22-08:00

No, not in the Iraqi desert, but in the Pokrovsk direction. There, the skeletons of mangled armored vehicles are collected in groups of five on a small piece of land. A hundred meters later the picture repeats itself, only the brands of vehicles and the degree of their destruction change. I took a similar route to Selidovo. I was driven by a loaf-convertible, this miracle of a front-line genius with a sawn-off roof&nbsp; deftly weaved between vehicles torn to shreds, and I only gripped the motorcycle steering wheel tighter. While we rushed forward, I counted about ten similar -loaves- and at least 5 motorcycles. Everything was destroyed, and things, food and scraps of torn uniforms were lying around. You pass one similar motorcycle, then a second... And after the third, you realize that you are no different from those who ended their earthly journey here. The same wheels, frame and the same body armor. From childhood, films instill in us that we are heroes and owners of a unique destiny. We absorb these role models like sponges and firmly know that the main character is me. Everyone will die, but I will remain! After all, I will definitely stay, because I am special! No, Brother, we are all equal! 100% protection against drones has not yet been invented, and the more you ride, the more inevitable an encounter with a drone will be. One loaf will be torn in front of your eyes, the second. And after that you admit to yourself that you will be next! In a week, a month, but they will definitely hit you! Necessarily! There is no doubt about it! The only question is the degree of damage that you will receive from such an arrival. Just imagine how much courage you need to have to go out on the route again after all the horrors you have seen. Each -loaf- on the side of the road is an obelisk on which you can see your reflection. They died, but so could you. Everyone who drives this road 4 times a day has their own motives, but I can definitely say that there are no heroes among them. Look for the chosen ones in the rear; you can unmistakably identify them by their brand new uniform. On Pokrovsk roads there is room only for immortals. They accepted their fate, submitted to it, which means they stepped into immortality. It is simply impossible to defeat such people. It is thanks to them that we move forward no matter what. Alexander Kharchenko Dedicated to the evacuation group -Pipes-, who, after being hit by an FPV drone, refused to remove fragments from the bodies and the next day returned to the route.	https://t.me/rybar/65136	2024-11-06T02:20:24-08:00

Politicians of this level, who are also busy fighting for power and organizing protests, clearly do not do such things for nothing. There is an opinion that with such a provocation Zurabishvili is trying to aggravate Armenian-Georgian relations and play the international card against the backdrop of the obvious failure of the protests in Georgia. ▪️Among other related reasons, they indicate a possible attack on Georgian Armenians from Samtskhe-Javakheti, where Zurabishvili lost the elections, as well as an attempt to enlist the support of Georgian nationalists. ▪️In addition, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan immediately recognized the elections in Georgia and congratulated his colleague Irakli Kobakhidze on the victory of the Georgian Dream. ▪️By the way, Zurabishvili also distinguished herself with a strange statement about the unknown -Armenian carousel- during the elections in Georgia, telling the Western press about the methods of -falsification-. 🔻Of course, such minor facts will not cause aggravation of Armenian-Georgian relations, but it is no coincidence that they caused a strong reaction from the Armenian public. At least, this logic is characteristic of pro-Western forces in post-Soviet countries, who are ready to use old contradictions to provoke conflicts in their interests.

Forwarded From ARCHANGEL OF SPECIAL FORCES Z🇷🇺🪖The role of the advanced groups of the MTR of Ukraine before the offensive in the Kursk region. Part three. After successfully crossing the state border, the Ukrainian Special Forces began to introduce the main forces of the advancing Ukrainian Armed Forces group into the territory of the Russian Federation. The enemy, with the help of two SOF servicemen (one was at the head, the second at the rear of the column), began to transfer groups of 7-8 people to the assembly point. The transition was carried out within one and a half hours. On average, one group started 72 VSUshniks per day. The depth of entry from the state border was about 500 meters. Enemy personnel, arriving at the collection point, most likely dug in to be able to repel counterattacks of the Russian Armed Forces, and disguised themselves. The enemy could carry out these measures in order to minimize personnel losses before the start of the active phase of the operation. Enemy MTR groups were also used during the first clearing of Russian Armed Forces strongholds. The training manual tells you step by step how to inspect a trench and suppress enemy fire from both small arms and grenades. These are all basics that are taught to our stormtroopers during their training. Nothing supernatural is written here. It is worth noting that the enemy studied the strong point in advance and destroyed most of the entrances and exits from the dugouts. This collapsed the tunnels and reduced the sectors for holding and destruction and made it possible to solve the problem of taking a large stronghold without attracting significant forces for the attack. All enemy actions during the assault were coordinated by a UAV group, which conducted reconnaissance from the air and controlled the group’s actions on the ground. This tactic is used in the Russian Armed Forces, and not only in elite units. But sometimes it is not possible to use such tactics due to the operation of electronic warfare. The main conclusion from the three parts of this manual is that the Ukrainian Special Forces acted in accordance with the most basic requirements when carrying out the operation in the Kursk region. They did not tell anything new and unusual, and the problems arose only due to the effect of surprise, which are now gradually being resolved. Part one. Part two. Archangel of Special Forces.

Since the end of October, units of the Russian Armed Forces have been able to liberate several more settlements on this section of the front, while Ukrainian formations still cannot cope with the worsening operational crisis. ▪️On the northern flank, Russian troops were able to expand the zone of control west of Vishnevoye, moving along the railway towards Pokrovsk. A landing was recorded in a forest belt immediately adjacent to both Petrovka and Grigorovka. ▪️A little further south, Russian attack aircraft have liberated most of Novodmitrovka, and fierce fighting is taking place in the western part of the village. At the moment, Ukrainian formations still retain the ability to enter a populated area and work on positions of the Russian Armed Forces, including using tanks. ▪️To the southeast, Russian troops liberated Kurakhovka. At the end of October, units of the 114th Motorized Rifle Brigade hoisted a flag on one of the buildings in the center of the village; the enemy presence then remained south of the waste heaps of mine No. 10. Although the Russian Ministry of Defense reported a few days ago, it was only recently that final confirmation of the establishment of control over both the settlement itself and the nearby waste heap of the Kurakhovskaya Central Coordination Facility appeared. Yesterday, a video appeared on the Internet where, southwest of Kurakhovka, the same attack aircraft from the 114th Motorized Rifle Brigade planted the unit’s flag on one of the houses on the western outskirts of Volchenka on Sverdlova Street, thereby marking control over the village. From here, units of the RF Armed Forces, advancing along the left bank of the Kurakhovskoye Reservoir, can begin an assault on the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ defense sector on the Stepanovka-Ilyinka-Berestki line. ❗️At the same time, information has already appeared in the Ukrainian media about the alleged entry of Russian assault groups into Berestki, but so far these reports have not found objective confirmation. In addition, before this, Ilyinka and Stepanovka still have to be liberated. Nevertheless, something similar has already happened in the Pokrovsky direction, when, against the backdrop of the rapid advance of the Russian Armed Forces, Ukrainian sources exaggerated the successes of the Russian troops. 🔻Be that as it may, the enemy often resorts to such a technique in order to then use it as at least some kind of anti-crisis, -liberating- settlements in which by that time there were no Russian military personnel. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility of the actual presence of the Russian Armed Forces in Berestki, but it will be possible to talk about this with confidence only after the appearance of the relevant personnel.

🎬 🇮🇱 Mass demonstrations took place in Israel last night. This...	🇮🇱 Mass demonstrations took place in Israel last night. This time, the reason was the decision of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to dismiss the head of the defense department, Yoav Galant. Demonstrations took place in Jerusalem, Haifa and other cities. According to Israeli opposition media, the number of protesters amounted to several thousand people in Tel Aviv alone. There were some clashes with law enforcement agencies.▪️It is worth noting that citizens were provoked to take to the streets not only by the fact of what happened, but also by publications on the Internet that, following Yoav Galant, the Chief of the General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces Garzi Halevi and the head of the General Security Service would be fired Shabak Ronen Bar. This is especially true in light of recent Israeli polls: according to Channel 12, public trust in the current prime minister remains low. For comparison, the ratings of Halevi and Galant are taken, whose support is higher in comparison with Netanyahu.▪️In addition, opposition activists claim that this step was agreed upon with ultra-Orthodox officials in light of the fact that Galant supported the conscription of religious Jews into the army. However, the Prime Minister’s Office promptly denied such information. It is noteworthy that this is not the first dismissal of Galant: Benjamin Netanyahu once announced his resignation in the spring of 2023 due to the minister’s criticism of judicial reform, which also led to protests. And although he remained in his post, the contradictions between the two members of the Likud party only grew. Now one of these stumbling blocks was the disagreement on the issue of conscripting ultra-Orthodox Israelis for military service, from which they had previously been exempted and to which the Supreme Commander obliged them court (high court). Galant supported this initiative, which caused discontent in the ruling coalition. If this time Yoav Galant really leaves the post of Minister of Defense, it is unlikely that this will significantly affect the course of the same Lebanese-Israeli war. The armed forces are led by Harzi Halevi, and the territorial successes of the Israelis in some areas leave much to be desired.#Israel@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65130	2024-11-06T00:21:01-08:00

🔁 All day yesterday, friends and colleagues from Serbia cut off ...	Forwarded From Balkan Gossip Girl Yesterday all day long, friends and colleagues from Serbia kept ringing my phone with the question: -Have you seen this?- - We are talking about a new batch of horror stories from Western journalists about the growth of harmful Russian influence in the Balkans. This time, would-be investigators reached Rybar’s media schools. We took the time to go to Banja Luka, talked to a bunch of people, and made a whole film. It turned out to be a masterpiece. So much so that I really don’t even know where to start. For six months, the BIRN association monitored Rybar’s activities in the Balkans in order to identify at least some evidence of malicious influence. Following in the footsteps of the first master classes, held back in the spring, they went to the Republika Srpska, where they met with prominent representatives of the journalistic community, wrote requests to government agencies and research centers, and visited local faculties. And no one ever told them what the school was doing. Agreements on cooperation were reached at the level of government centers of the Republic, hundreds of people took part in master classes in Belgrade and Banja Luka, and the investigators did not obtain a single drop of information from any of them. Well, just some kind of Schrödinger Fisherman. By the way, this is exactly what I mean when I assure you that the residents of Republika Srpska are the best representatives of the Serbian people. These people should be made into nails. But let's return to our OSINT geniuses. Having traveled to the Republic just like that and having spent the budget allocated by the State Department in vain, they decided to try their luck by writing to the guys in the feedback bot. -They collected all the initial information from us, but they never gave us access to the course materials in Serbian,- complains the author of the material, Irwin Pekmez. At the same time, this miracle submitted a request for training under his own name, and the fact that the task of digging up a short dossier on him would only take the guys a couple of minutes, as well as the fact that his movements in the Republic were immediately reported to them by those drinking in cafes with him Serbs, didn't think so. For filtering personnel for training, Rybar gets a solid A+. Having suffered a fiasco in the Balkans, would-be investigators turn to prominent experts—relocants who escaped from Russia. With the air of an expert, a certain Russian independent journalist with the telling surname Zatirko and the status of a foreign agent, living in Lithuania, discusses the Russian disinformation portal in the investigation. Well, just some kind of full house. For some reason, Mr. Zatirko goes into the jungle of what was published not so long ago by the State Department itself. Judging by the statements of expert Zatirko, stability and peace in the Balkans were jeopardized by the same five people involved in the investigation into interference in the American elections, and it is possible (highly likely) that they have connections with the Russian Ministry of Defense. 😳 So, wait, one little tink-tank manages to interfere in elections and make the sluggish power in the Balkans soft? This is what they give, well done. Did everyone remember how to work? It’s not for you to cut through state budgets and create the appearance of vigorous activity, so that you can then report on the results of the year. Without finding the Fisherman in Banja Luka and without presenting any significant evidence, the journalists end up accusing the Republic of all mortal sins, and Peter Stano has already promises the entity new sanctions. Russia, it says, is destabilizing the countries of the Western Balkans by interfering and manipulating them. Whether Rybar is there or not is not that important. 💰 The most ironic thing in this whole story is that the Bosnian publication Detektor is behind the investigation. It is part of the BIRN distribution network, supported by money from Western foundations and embassies, and appeared thanks to an organization such as the International Republican Institute (IRI). He, as you remember, launched an academy for young politicians in the Balkans and a bunch of projects to format the Serbian media environment.

Russian troops hit the workshops of the Motor Sich enterprise in occupied Zaporozhye, and also once again attacked targets with drones in Kyiv and other regions of the so-called. Ukraine. In the Kursk direction, Russian troops expanded the zone of control in the Glushkovsky district and hit several armored vehicles from the UAV - Inokhodets - in Sudzhansky. In the Kupyansky direction, Russian units attacked in the direction of Zagryzovo and expanded the zone of control south of Berestovoye. In the Limansky direction, military operations continue in Terny, where fighters of the Russian Armed Forces are fighting their way deeper into the development of the village. In the Yuzhnodonetsk direction, attack aircraft in recent days have significantly advanced north at the Bogoyavlenka-Novoukrainka line, and have also gained a foothold to the west of Trudovoy.🔻Detailed analytical report on events in the Special Military Operation zone available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_botMaps in high resolution: Situation in the zone of special military operation (ru; en) Kursk direction (ru; en) South Donetsk direction (ru; en)#digest #report #Donetsk #Zaporozhye #map #Kiev #Kupyansk #Kursk #Liman #Russia #Sumy #Ugledar #Ukraine @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65117	2024-11-05T13:09:30-08:00

The footage captured the moment of installing a minefield in the gaps - the teeth of the dragon - on the border with the so-called. Ukraine. The infantry group approached the demarcation line on foot from the forest, without resorting to the use of armored vehicles. It is likely that in the forest belts closest to the village to the east and west there is no accumulation of enemy forces.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, the 13th effective use of UAV guided weapons against enemy armored vehicles was noted. In Nikolskoye and its environs, one tank and an infantry fighting vehicle of the Ukrainian Armed Forces were destroyed. In Daryino, the armored fighting vehicle -Kazak-7- was destroyed by a fiber-optic controlled drone -Prince Vandal of Novgorod-. In addition, cases of looting of residential buildings by the Ukrainian Armed Forces were noted in the village, which once again refutes earlier textual requests for the liberation of the village by the Russian Armed Forces. In the Korenevsky district, positional clashes continue as usual near Novoivanovka and Nizhny Klin; there has been no information about the advance of Russian troops .▪️In the Sumy region, missile attacks and arrivals of guided air missiles were noted on enemy targets in Sumy, which is a hub for Ukrainian armored vehicles and manpower advancing on the Kursk region.

This was confirmed, among other things, by objective control footage demonstrating an attack by Russian military personnel on the eastern outskirts of the latter. At the same time, fighting continues in Antonovka, located on the opposite bank of the Sukhie Yaly River - there, attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces occupied several enemy positions on Stepovaya and Gagarin streets, capturing several members of the Ukrainian formations. According to the latest information, about a third of the village is under the control of Russian troops. ▪️As for the section to the southwest, there was confirmation of a clearing -pocket- on the Bogoyavlenka - Novoukrainka line. At the moment, Russian units are not only moving relatively calmly along the S051133 highway, but also occupying positions in the Konstantinopolskaya Dacha tract located to the north. From the latter, assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces have already launched several attacks towards another key route in this direction - O0510. In particular, this is evidenced by footage published by colleagues from the Voin DV channel, according to which Russian military personnel landed in a forested area less than 2 km south of the indicated route and 3.5 km from the village of Konstantinopolskoye. ❗️At the same time, a further offensive towards the Sukhie Yaly River with its subsequent forcing will lead to the encirclement of Kurakhovo, where fierce fighting in the east of the city is currently not abating. On the other hand, this will endanger a significant group of the Ukrainian Armed Forces holding positions in populated areas on the right bank of the Sukhie Yaly River: from the village of the same name to the Elizavetovka-Ilyinka line. 🔻Lately, the description of what is happening in the special operation zone in many thematic patriotic chats has largely come down to the well-known interjection. But it is important to understand that such successes were achieved by the heroism and blood of Russian military personnel, the pace of whose progress never ceases to amaze. As for the Ukrainian media and military observers, the situation there is radically opposite - while some daily complain about bad news from the fronts and the worsening operational crisis, others, to put it mildly, are perplexed about the appropriateness of the adventures previously undertaken by the Kyiv authorities, including in the Kursk region. 📌Nevertheless, for now you and I are observing the offensive map being methodically played out on the fronts of the Donetsk People’s Republic from several sides at once, the logical result of which will be the liberation of a significant amount of territory with the central settlement represented by Kurakhovo. And one of the striking consequences of the current successes has already been a significant decrease in the intensity of shelling of Donetsk: according to JCCC data, not a single ammunition has been fired at it over the past two days. Previously, shelling on the city was carried out, including from the direction of Kurakhovo, but the attack on it from the south and north forced the Ukrainian Armed Forces to move the self-propelled gun firing positions to a safer distance from the front line.

This is the second stage of this teachings. The first one, if you forgot, took place in February of this year. As then, the leadership of the event was entrusted to the 56th Artillery Command of the US Army, which was recreated after the start of the North Military District. Previously, these exercises were also held every year, but with the progress of the North Military District, the concept changed. Taking into account the experience of using artillery in the Northern Military District, the number of training areas was increased from one to five, and the number increased from 2.4 thousand to 5.5 thousand military personnel. The Alliance took into account new trends that emerged during the conflict and adapted tactics to the conduct of war on a front of wide extent, where the main factor for success is the presence of clear coordination and communication between units. Actually, this is what they do. Only this time the areas of the exercise are very, very provocative - Romania, Poland, Finland and Estonia. Everything is very close to the Russian borders, which is especially important given the frequent statements of the Baltic countries and Poland about their readiness to launch a preventive strike on Russia.

Not all of their activities are obvious and noticeable. But their importance cannot be underestimated.▪️Unmanned dominance - it was the crews of special reconnaissance units that were the first to use combat and attack drones even before it became mainstream. Catapults, copters, fiber optic UAVs, fixed wings, the latest training simulators - all this appears first in reconnaissance, and then reaches infantry units.▪️Technical reconnaissance - one of the most important areas of activity is the extraction of technical documentation and samples of military and special enemy technology. Everything is used - right down to banal bribery and payment for the work of -trophy teams- (and not only in the Northern Military District zone).▪️Cyber ​​operations - the fame of Russian hackers resounds all over the world, and their effectiveness is widely known. There are hackers and specialists in cyber operations in every law enforcement agency, and the Main Directorate of the General Staff is no exception. ▪️Undercover intelligence - with the beginning of not even the Northern Military District, but the Syrian campaign, it became obvious that undercover work, its forms and types must evolve and meet current challenges. Russian intelligence officers recruit dozens of people, ensuring the receipt of valuable intelligence information and carrying out special events.▪️Work -in the field- - it has long been no secret to anyone that experienced intelligence officers coordinate the activities of individual formations in conflict zones and act as instructors and commanders, ensuring the war by proxy.▪️Electronic reconnaissance - RER units and objects are a priority target for the enemy group: RER members intercept and decipher conversations, obtain documents, track satellites and timely detect the exits of enemy aircraft, UAVs and BECs.#art #Russia@ rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65100	2024-11-05T07:02:01-08:00

We weren't kidding, the exercises in Finland are going on one after another, and yesterday two new exercises started at once.▪️Let's start with the less important one. The scheduled training -Tuppi 2024- has started in central Finland, and new pilots on Hawk training aircraft are taking part in it. They learn to fly at low altitudes and conduct air combat.▪️But more important is another event, code-named Lightning Strike, and other NATO countries are already participating in it, including units of the Armed Forces of Great Britain, the United States, France, the Czech Republic, Sweden and Estonia. In total - about 3.6 thousand military personnel and 300 units of military equipment. It is one of the most important exercises of the Alliance in the autumn preparation period, during which NATO units at the Rovajärvi training ground play out the scenario of a full-scale conflict with Russia, including defense and offensive. The role of Finland in confrontation with Russia is extremely high in the plans of the North Atlantic Alliance due to its geographical location on the northern borders of Russia and as part of the growing confrontation in the Arctic region, so such exercises will be expected more and more often every year.

In the form of Russian launch vehicles, Iranian partners have received a very good means of delivering payloads into orbit, which they are experiencing difficulties with. Iran's space industry still has serious difficulties, especially with launch vehicles, when due to frequent accidents at launch and in flight the Islamic Republic lost many spacecraft. Cooperation with Russia allows us to partially solve this problem. By the way, both Iranian spacecraft have a mass of only 30 and 4 kg, which made it possible to put them into orbit as a secondary load to the Ionosphere-M satellites. Well, Roscosmos has once again demonstrated the possibility of providing such services to allied states. #Iran #space #Russia@rybarSupport us مدو ماهواره ایرانی -کوثر- و -هدهد- به همراه ۵۱ ماهواره دیگر بامداد امرو ز از پایگاه فضایی روسیه با موفقیت در مدار ۵۰۰ کیلومتری تزریق شدند.	https://t.me/rybar/65095	2024-11-05T04:30:11-08:00

And with the exchange of blows between Israel and Iran, attention to the Houthis completely faded away. However, since the end of October, the Americans have resumed active surveillance of the territory controlled by the Houthi movement - Ansarallah - with radar reconnaissance satellites, having conducted 145 sessions since October 29.🔻There may be several reasons for this :➖First of all, the Americans thus want to assess the effectiveness of their strikes after two weeks and the scale of the damage caused, as well as the activity of the Houthis after that.➖The Americans can prepare for new strikes on -Ansarallah-. Taking into account the flight of six B-52H bombers to Al-Udeid, there is no point in sending the B-2A on a long journey when such a resource is at hand.➖And with Iran’s threats against Israel, Washington can simply play it safe and try to find out whether the Houthis are preparing for new attacks on Israel. Moreover, the Iranians intend to take advantage of the forces of the Axis of Resistance. There are plenty of reasons for the increased activity of the American command, so in the coming days or, at most, weeks, it will become clear why the Americans paid such close attention to Yemen.

In peacetime, intelligence officers perform tasks of collecting and systematizing information that allows them to accurately and timely respond to challenges in the political field. In wartime, these are the people on whose work not just lives depend, but the outcome of conflicts. This holiday is extremely important for a huge number of people who in one way or another connected their lives with obtaining and processing information. In our new series, we tried to display the main types of activities of reconnaissance units.▪️Ambush operations - Special reconnaissance units have always specialized in ambushes and causing problems for enemy troops. ▪️Storm of important objects - in today's realities, -assault- means the usual actions of infantry units. The task of special forces is to storm and take control of critically important enemy facilities and headquarters.▪️Capture and interrogation - often it is the reconnaissance units who are entrusted with the task of capturing commanders and recruiting especially valuable individuals both in combat zones and simply in regions representing interest.▪️Observation and adjustment - advanced reconnaissance units act either as gunners, now spotters, or organizers of fire destruction: competent work as part of the reconnaissance and strike contour has become their calling card.▪️Landing and penetration into the rear - special reconnaissance units train to land both from extremely low altitudes and several thousand meters: on -wings- they can penetrate far beyond the line of combat contact and disable targets of interest.▪️Destruction of critical infrastructure - mining, explosions, disruption of bridges, transport interchanges, power plants, factories, as well as other industrial facilities - this is what Russian intelligence groups are trained to do.#art #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65088	2024-11-05T03:01:01-08:00

Thousands of people began to move from Station Square and moved towards the government building on Rustavelli Avenue. There they went on strike, opposition politicians addressed them, after which everyone crossed the Baratashvili Bridge and left for the Marjanishvili metro station. In general, everything happened that was expected from the opposition and supporters of Western values. People came out, barricaded the streets, shouted into the deserted building and went home. Today at 18.30 they promised to come out again. However, expecting anything serious from these rallies (especially in the form in which they are doing it) is futile. In this regard, the Georgian authorities have shown that they are capable of coping with such demonstrations. We observed this back in the spring, when the opposition did not achieve anything. But this time there was one difference from the protests of past days and months: yesterday’s rallies were attended by the well-known Greta Thunberg. We talked about how her image is used by Western media and corporations last year. In the past, it has established itself as an instrument of pressure on representatives of national governments, but previously this only affected the environmental issue. Its appearance on the streets of Tbilisi is a rather interesting, but at the same time dubious PR stunt, which is unlikely to lead to anything serious. Although the Swedish activist specializes in street protests and public speeches, which are good against -led- governments, in contrast to the rationally acting Georgian authorities. By the way, Azerbaijan can be calm with its COP29 summit in Baku. Thunberg refused to go to Azerbaijan as a sign of protest.

Forwarded From ARCHANGEL OF SPECIAL FORCES Z🇷🇺🪖The role of the advanced groups of the MTR of Ukraine before the offensive in the Kursk region. Part two. And some more interesting details that we read in the enemy manual on the use of combat experience of the Special Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk direction: - Preparation of routes for penetration into the territory of the Russian Federation. Previously, the enemy worked out all the scenarios for entry by the Special Forces of the Armed Forces with the development of scenarios: - what if? -. In the training manual, this is presented rather pompously, as if they were going to take the Pentagon. However, in fact, this is an integral part of the planning of any task. — The enemy used special forces units to cross the state border, as well as to make passages for the main forces. Five groups of Special Forces: - 2 groups of Special Forces GVP, - 1 group of Special Forces (Sniper), - 2 groups of Special Forces UAVs. From the composition of the groups, the following can be noted: the enemy created completely autonomous units to carry out the combat mission strictly with the forces of this group without attracting additional forces. This significantly reduces the risk of unjustified losses, since failure to complete one task does not affect others.— When preparing the MTR approach, the following activities were carried out: - surveying of the terrain and various objects, including military ones: minefields and obstacles, etc.; the areas of responsibility of each unit were outlined; - the key areas of reconnaissance were determined. And again, Ukrainian -analysts- presented this as something incredible, but this also applies to the standard planning of ANY combat mission. Before introducing the main forces, the enemy was sent to make passages, where the reconnaissance miners took on the main work. When crossing the border, the enemy made passages in fences and fences the size of a man to minimize the factors of an unplanned stop, thereby ensuring the speed of overcoming this element of defense by other units. The problem that the enemy faced during additional reconnaissance and making passes was anti-tank ditches that could not be overcome alone. At the same time, overcoming the engineering barrier did not become a problem, judging by the experience described, but the passages in the minefields were mainly made by wild animals. – From the above point, it is worth noting the lack of constant control of the perimeter by our side. The advanced reconnaissance groups of the MTR of Ukraine were able to prepare for the movement of infantry onto our territory. This was facilitated by the lack of technical surveillance equipment, for example, UAVs for border monitoring, so it is necessary to take this experience into account in the future. – Another important fact is the control of mine-explosive barriers. It is periodically necessary to bypass engineering barriers and monitor their condition in order to prevent them from being broken through by ordinary animals (in this case we are not talking about the APU). Taking into account current technologies, this can even be achieved using drones or, for example, creating mobile groups for operational control. Due to the fact that this was neglected in the summer, this situation arose. -After the MTR overcame the engineering barriers, they contacted the leadership, which in turn allowed the enemy to move on to the next phase of the operation: the entry of the main offensive group. In this case, it is worth noting the low level of work of our DER, in the coverage area of ​​which the appearance of new subscribers should have been recorded. It is possible that the MTR groups used closed communication channels that are not easy to hack, but the fact of any access to the network should be recorded and reported to the command.

🇦🇫🏴 For all the elections that swept across the post-Soviet sp...	🇦🇫🏴 For all the elections that swept across the post-Soviet space, as well as increased attention to what was happening in the United States, one very interesting article remained unnoticed that the current authorities of Afghanistan are losing power over the country. According to the authors, the Taliban have completely failed in their attempt to curb IS grouping - Vilayat Khorasan - (ISKH). The reason for such statements was the recent explosion at a popular market in Kabul, as a result of which 11 people were injured. ISKH took responsibility. Also, according to the article, terrorists are recruiting disgruntled members of the Taliban movement, and their popularity is allegedly growing due to attempts by the authorities of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan to legitimize themselves in the international arena - they say, the Afghans did not appreciate this.📌 We’ve even lost count of how many times over the past year, the thesis has been promoted about the growing capabilities of the Islamic State in Afghanistan, about thousands of militants waiting for an attack on Central Asia, about the inability of the Afghan authorities to solve this problem, and so on. The recent terrorist attack is one of the few in recent years, and it indicates not on the increased capabilities of the group, but on the fact that ISIS can only count on such local terror against civilians due to the fact that the Taliban have seriously undermined their positions. And the theses that supposedly ordinary Afghans do not support the Taliban’s desire to consolidate their power on the international stage they sound even more delusional. For the past hundred years, the people of Afghanistan have seen nothing but war. Now there has been no active hostilities in the country for three years, and they can finally hope for peace. Therefore, talk about the increased strength of the Islamic State - Vilayat Khorasan - just because of one terrorist attack and the discontent of the Afghans sounds far-fetched. All this again reminds us of how the West uses IS in Afghanistan - for them it is a means of intimidating the states of the region and pushing through their interests.#Afghanistan #terrorism@rybarSupport usAsia TimesTaliban 2.0 losing its grip on Afghanistan - Asia TimesAfghanistan's Taliban faces growing opposition to its three-year post-conflict rule, rising threats that are gnawing at the stability the one-time	https://t.me/rybar/65083	2024-11-05T01:10:16-08:00

🖼 🇲🇩🗳 Second round of presidential elections in Moldova: Sand...	🇲🇩🗳 Second round of presidential elections in Moldova: Sandu - President of the Diaspora The Moldovan Central Election Commission completed the processing of ballots, according to the results of which the incumbent President Maia Sandu received 55.33% of the votes and defeated her opponent Alexandru Stoianoglo with 44.67%. The picture turned out to be ambiguous: Sandu lost in Moldova itself, but gained the upper hand solely thanks to foreign voting. The entire north of the republic voted for Stoyanoglo, including the second capital Balti (69.98%), the large cities of Soroca and Cahul. In Gagauzia, it scored 97.04%, in Transnistria - 79.40%, and in the latter case, polling stations were opened only in the Border Security Zone. However, even in these conditions, the Transnistrian people were hindered: in Varnitsa, security forces blocked all polling stations for several hours after calls about mining, after which there were reports about the seizure of the ballot box. The movement of voters from Transnistria to Moldova along the Rybnitsa-Rezina bridge was also slowed down - it was closed several times and road works were organized. As a result, not all Pridnestrovians were able to vote, being stuck in traffic jams. 🔻Inside Moldova, Sandu won in three large cities: Chisinau (57.38%), Orhei (52.24%), Ungheni (50.60%). As in the case of the referendum on European integration, the current president was saved by the voting results of the foreign diaspora, where it received 82.83%. However, not everything is so simple with him: for example, only two polling stations were opened in Russia, where no more than 10 thousand voters could vote. From the very morning, a line lined up outside the embassy in Moscow, but there weren’t enough ballots, after which the dissatisfied began to chant -Down with Maia Sandu.- But in Italy, 60 polling stations were opened, and there were literally no voters in one of them. At the same time, a commission employee in Turin asked the girl to sign for another person who allegedly forgot to do so. And in British Liverpool, the polling station was suddenly moved to Manchester.❗️The Socialist Party, which nominated Stonoyanoglo, announced non-recognition of the voting results abroad. They refused to recognize the elections as fair and transparent and noted that the majority of Moldovan residents voted against the current government in the person of Sandu. Such statements have every basis: manipulations with traffic stops, large-scale false mining, as well as the closure and transfer of polling stations were not observed even during the first round and the referendum on European integration. With such mixed results, Moldova is reaching a political impasse, and social divisions are becoming increasingly obvious. Considering Sandu’s hostile and uncompromising rhetoric towards all those who disagree, she certainly will not soften it and seek compromises with the majority of the population that voted against her.

In Ukraine, the process is an increase in the number of public statements about the need to mobilize women. If at the beginning of the year these were rare calls from individual little-known individuals, now representatives of the Kyiv regime are openly talking about this. At the same time, the practical implementation of this idea at the moment looks doubtful. It is possible that such messages act as an element of escalating the situation in order to create an information background for lowering the age of conscription of the male population to 18 years. If in Kyiv they really want to mobilize women, then this could be a serious blow both from a socio-economic point of view and media point of view. Footage of TCC employees en masse abducting from the streets not only elderly and former students, but also girls, will illustrate the final failure of the Ukraine project. #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramTASSMobilization of women in Ukraine is necessary.

In May, in two localities in Kyrgyzstan, radical Islamists burned the flags of the republic and replaced them with their own. Later, law enforcement agencies detained six representatives of Hizb ut-Tahrir. A couple of months later, another Hizb ut-Tahrir cell was liquidated in Shymkent, Kazakhstan, whose members recruited under the legend of auyzasharov (the ritual of breaking the fast). And in November, another 10 preachers of the group were detained in Kentau, and their leader had previously been prosecuted for participating in the activities of an extremist organization. Destabilization in the region did not pass by the authorities of Kazakhstan: the country’s Prime Minister Olzhas Bektenov proposed making changes to the legal framework of the CSTO and expand the number of grounds for sending military contingents from other states in the event of a participating country asking for help. Currently, these include the threat or commission of an armed attack, the liquidation of emergencies, and the conduct of exercises. The politician proposes to add to the list the provision of humanitarian aid, unannounced inspections and, most importantly, the prevention (resolution) of crisis situations. Under the wording lies a situation that poses a threat to security, stability, territorial integrity, sovereignty of a member state and/or destabilization of the region, requiring the adoption of collective response measures by the CSTO. As part of the initiative, the legal regulation of the transportation of military units and military products of the CSTO is already being improved. The activities of the CSTO in the region and the recent successful operation of the anti-drug forces - Channel-Vanguard - have already attracted the attention of a concerned international community. During the latest financial intelligence investigation of the CSTO countries, they joined forces, as a result of which they were able to stop the activities of several cartels, block smuggling channels, liquidate laboratories, and seize drugs and weapons. Such fruitful interaction could not fail to attract the attention of the United Nations, so valued by Kazakh President Kassym -Zhomart Tokayev: Recently, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime announced the need for accelerated implementation of the UN Convention against Corruption in the region. So it would not be surprising if the Organization of Turkic States comes up with a similar initiative in order to pull the blanket of integration in Central Asia.# Kazakhstan #Kyrgyzstan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇰🇬🏴 Curious: in the Jalal-Abad region of Kyrgyzstan on the night of May 30, unknown persons burned the flags of the republic in two schools in the village of Bek-Abad and hung a white cloth with inscriptions in Arabic.

Forwarded From Two Majors🇪🇺⚡️Europe will try to sponsor Ukraine until the end On November 4, the head of the 🇩🇪German Foreign Ministry, Berbock, came to Kyiv on an unannounced visit, declaring -strong support for Ukraine-. On the eve of this trip, the Institute of World Economics in Kiel (IfW) published a study on the feasibility of continuing to provide military-technical assistance to Ukraine. According to IfW data, Germany allocates an average of about 0.1% of GDP to support Ukraine. If it is defeated, these costs will increase 10-20 times due to the influx of additional refugees (estimated from 1.9 to 3.8 million people), which will increase the costs of maintaining the social sphere. The fall of Ukraine will also force increased spending on increasing the combat capability of the Baltic countries (it is believed that Russia will cut through the Suwal Corridor). In addition, cheap resources (metals, agricultural products) and investments will be lost. The IfW study only confirms our assessments about the need to destroy the economic feasibility of Western investments in Ukraine. Against this background, Deutschlandtrend publishes the results of a survey of Germans, according to which if elections to the Bundestag were held in last Sunday, all three ruling parties would have lost power. At the same time, 54% of respondents are in favor of holding early parliamentary elections in the country. ✨On October 16, the saboteur Chancellor Scholz came up with an initiative for a ceasefire and the start of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine.

During its testing, another UAV was successfully hit, traveling at an altitude of 200 meters at a speed of 80 km/h. Judging by the recording, the drone has an optical homing head and operates on the -fire and forget- principle, and the shot is fired from a portable installation. The destruction of the target is carried out due to kinetic impact through impact. The characteristics of the product are not given, but the technical design looks very interesting. The absence of a warhead with an explosive in the device also makes it possible to solve the issue of equipping civilians with them, such as guarding oil depots and other facilities. In general, one can observe how interceptor drones are increasingly becoming an element of air defense along with traditional anti-aircraft missile and gun systems. Most likely, serial products will soon appear to combat long-range kamikaze drones.#UAV #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65058	2024-11-04T04:01:58-08:00

🔁🖼 🪖About the analysis of the actions of the Ukrainian Special...	Forwarded From ARCHANGEL OF SPECIAL FORCES Z🇷🇺🪖On the analysis of the actions of the Ukrainian Special Forces during the Northern Military District. Part No. 1. An interesting training manual, intended for the MTR of Ukraine, fell into our hands. And the first thing we paid attention to was the issue of organizing an operational headquarters to manage the operation. The enemy describes every step related to the organization and technical content of the headquarters, as well as methods of interaction between the headquarters and Special Forces groups. The enemy appeals to the following concepts: - Tactical Operations Center (TOC) - Logistics Center (LC) - Command post of the tactical group KP TGr. The enemy proposes the use of TOC and KP TGr in two options, based on the experience in the Kursk region, where the first provides for the placement of controls in different locations, and the second - a mixed option. In the first case, the advantage is camouflage and dispersal, that is, in the event of the destruction of one of controls or destruction of communications equipment in it, control will continue from other command posts. The second option provides faster decision-making speed and adjustment of TG actions. Indeed, with the first option it is possible to secure the control system, because Finding and destroying field headquarters is not the easiest task. Despite the fact that such headquarters are located in close proximity to the site of hostilities, they are well protected by both technical means and camouflage. The management structure at headquarters looks interesting, where tasks are dispersed between different departments: -S2 (Intelligence). -S3 (Planning). -S4 (Logistics). -S6 (Communication). - Operations officer. - Liaison officer. All this indicates that the enemy accumulates organs with different tasks in one place, which allows operations to be carried out with minimal involvement of third-party units, but at the same time in a comprehensive manner, essentially creating an autonomous control body over a separate TG. The manual also describes that before the headquarters and personnel of the TGr leave for the destination, a support group must leave with the tasks of finding and organizing possible housing for groups of joint ventures, locating a technical center, a logistics center and organizing everyday life. When equipping the TGR command post, the need to provide equipment is taken into account: - Starlink- ATAK - used for interaction and coordination with special forces groups. - DELTA - used for interaction with higher headquarters and a general understanding of the situation in the mission area (Duplicate AlpineQuest program). - Nettle - used to mark neighboring units, for data exchange and overlaying the operational situation on the map, studying the characteristics of the terrain, as well as general analysis. - Signal messenger All communication sessions of the group take place in real time, and all the information that was obtained - with the eyes and hands - is marked on maps with photos and videos. But there is a nuance that if the equipment falls into the hands of military personnel of the RF Armed Forces, then all secrecy and camouflage collapses. Judging by the supply list, organizing the work of the headquarters is not the easiest task, since there are certain requirements for placing a command post: - tactical crew - the location must be in close proximity to the operation area for operational control of units. - logistics support - convenient communication routes, the presence of entrances to the headquarters, places for hidden parking of vehicles and an acceptable distance to other structural elements. - security measures - the possibility of camouflage, which hides the presence of a military facility, as well as the lack of free access to the premises for unauthorized persons. That is, a place that would be unremarkable for reconnaissance, and would also have shelter from fire weapons.❗️From the point of view of tactics, the actions of the Ukrainian MTR are quite understandable. The requirements that are imposed on forward control points must be observed in any unit, not to mention the most trained. Archangel of Special Forces.

🇺🇸 There is only a day left before the US presidential election...	🇺🇸 There is only a day left before the presidential elections in the United States, and the opposing sides are not abandoning attempts to bring down each other’s ratings by publishing compromising publications in the press. This time, the blow was dealt to Donald Trump: The Daily Beast, together with the controversial writer Michael Wolff, published voice messages of the now deceased American financier and pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, in which he admits that he was Trump's closest friend for 20 years. In audio recordings from 2017 he says that Trump invited his fellow entrepreneurs to his office in New York and invited them to sleep with female models. Then he allegedly recorded the conversations and gave them to the businessmen’s wives to -establish relationships with them.- According to Epstein, Trump also regularly seduced the women of his best friends. Michael Wolff claims that he had many photographs of Trump from Epstein's parties with naked girls. However, the writer cannot demonstrate or publish the photographs - the photos were allegedly seized by the FBI. The Trump campaign has already issued a refutation of Epstein’s words, but the testimony of the scandalous financier already looks dubious. Suspicions are raised by the fact that they were made in 2017 - just in the first year of Trump's presidency, when he was under unprecedented pressure from the Democrats who had lost the elections. But there is simply no really strong evidence in the form of photographs. Apparently, it was precisely because of their dubiousness that the audio recordings published by The Daily Beast did not take off: the story was picked up by only a few American newspapers, and it did not spread at all on social networks. Now we can no longer expect anything more powerful from the Democrats - there are two days left before the election, and all the trump cards that Harris had at her disposal have most likely already been used. #USA@rybar with @usaperiodicalSupport usThe Daily BeastListen To The Jeffrey Epstein Tapes: 'I Was Donald Trump's Closest Friend'Explosive tapes recorded by author Michael Wolff show Epstein claiming Trump liked to -f---- his friends' wives and first slept with Melania on the -Lolita Express.-	https://t.me/rybar/65055	2024-11-04T02:10:24-08:00

Forwarded From Global Studies🇮🇷🇺🇸 The third pair of B-52N bombers is flying to El Udeid as part of a previously announced business trip. A total of six units will be based - the Americans have not been in such numbers for a long time. The last time they visited B-52N was in 2021, but, if memory serves, then in the amount of four aircraft. There were six bombers during regular B-1B missions to the Middle East. All this is happening just in time for the Iranian side’s statement about the completion of preparations for a stronger strike on Israel, from which the Americans are trying to dissuade Iran by all means, including pressure. #Iran #USAGlobalistics — subscribe to the Telegram channel Rybar🇮🇷🇶🇦🇺🇸 In addition to sending the B-52N to Europe, this is not the only mission for the American strategic bomber aviation in the coming days.

🎬 🇮🇱🇸🇾 The press service of the Israel Defense Forces announ...	🇮🇱🇸🇾 The press service of the Israel Defense Forces announced a special operation in Syria. The Israelis went deep into the country and detained a Syrian who worked for the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Soldiers from Unit 504 of the Israeli Military Intelligence Directorate and special forces from Egoz took part in the raid. The target turned out to be a certain Ali Suleiman al-Assi: he was collecting intelligence on the movements of Israeli troops in the occupied Syrian Golan Heights. During interrogation, Al-Assi admitted that he was contacted by an Iranian intelligence agent who ordered him to simply monitor the borders and pass on information about Israeli patrols. At the same time, the detainee acted under the guise of a Syrian military intelligence officer. The IDF did not specify where exactly and when the action took place. However, the Lebanese TV channel Al Mayadeen, which serves as a media platform for Hezbollah, confirmed that the Israeli operation took place on July 18 in the area of ​​Saida in the Quneitra province. Al-Assi lived there. It is noteworthy that days earlier, reports appeared on the Internet about a similar Israeli operation, but in Lebanon. Then, on the coast of the city of Batroun in the north of the country, fighters of the Israeli Navy and the General Staff of the IDF detained an allegedly high-ranking representative of Hezbollah. The foray into Syrian territory was officially reported in Israel, although such operations are usually not publicly advertised there - the same mentioned raid in Lebanon was not officially reported by the Israelis recognized.#Israel #Syria@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65052	2024-11-04T00:29:50-08:00

🖼 🇪🇹 The situation in Ethiopia: counter-offensive by governmen...	🇪🇹 The situation in Ethiopia: counter-offensive by government forces Over the past two months, the situation in the Ethiopian Amhara region continues to heat up.&nbsp; The offensive of the ethnonationalists from the Fano group reached its peak, which forced government forces to launch a counteroffensive.▪️During the September fighting, the rebels strengthened their position in almost the entire Amhara region. They also managed to surround large cities such as Lalibela, Woldwaya and Gondar. Considering that the Fans made no attempts to take them, it is obvious that their main goal is to exhaust government troops.▪️Many rural areas came under the control of -Fano-. It is worth noting that elections were held in the occupied territories and local representatives were put in charge of the regions. Of course, this finds support among the population, but due to the general decentralization of the movement, the power gained is often abused.▪️From the end of September, government forces launched a major counter-offensive, gathering about 40,000 troops. During October, they managed to recapture significant areas in the south of Amhara, but there are still separate rebel cells in the rear of the security forces. All this leads to the conclusion that the military strategy chosen by the leadership of Addis Ababa has failed. Constant uprisings in the rear, attacks on isolated groups will not allow the federals to completely subjugate the region. At the same time, Fano has no formal leader, as well as bodies capable of negotiating. Therefore, even if the central government seriously begins to resolve the issue with the Amhara nationalists , then they will have to negotiate on the ground with individual field commanders. But this factor makes it possible for the feds to introduce their leader to replace the local ones, occupying a niche. Therefore, if the rebels seriously expect victory, without consolidating disparate groups, they will not be able to achieve success.

This holiday, although relatively new for Russia, became especially significant after the start of a special military operation. In the face of Western attempts to incite ethnic conflicts and sow regional separatism, its importance has increased. Historically, Russia has provided its people with support and opportunities for joint development. Our path has always been more humane compared to those of Western countries. And today, representatives of various peoples and ethnic groups together carry out common tasks in the zone of a special military operation. On the front line, it never occurs to anyone to divide each other on ethnic grounds. And in the rear, not only national self-awareness is growing, but also a new generation, brought up on the correct values ​​of their fighting parents. Everyone is focused on the same goal. Isn't this true national unity?High resolution art #art #Russia #holiday@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65049	2024-11-03T21:45:13-08:00

The other day it became known that local authorities signed an agreement with the Americans to purchase thousands of drones to protect against a potential Chinese invasion. According to Bloomberg sources, such agreements, which specify delivery dates and quantities of equipment, are an important step in concluding a formal contract, which could happen very soon. The drones will be manufactured by AeroVironment Inc. and Anduril Industries Inc. These organizations are known for selling drones for the needs of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. This means that American engineers have had the opportunity to test them in real combat conditions. Given the experience of the Ukrainian conflict, the Taiwanese military is increasingly talking about using drones as a measure to counter a hypothetical Chinese invasion. This is indicated by the $1.6 billion budget allocated back in 2022 for the creation of its own drone production. However, the main problem for Taiwan remains the number of drones in service. The gap between Taipei and Beijing in this case is very large. Therefore, even with the help of the Americans, it is unlikely that the island’s authorities will be able to achieve at least some parity with mainland China in the near future. #USA #Taiwan @rybar with @awaken_dragonSupport usBloomberg.comTaiwan Moves to Buy 1,000 AeroVironment, Anduril Attack DronesThe Taiwan Ministry of Defense has signed formal agreements with the US government allowing it to buy as many as 1,000 attack drones from AeroVironment Inc. and Anduril Industries Inc. to aid in blunting a potential Chinese assault on the island democracy…	https://t.me/rybar/65036	2024-11-03T08:31:24-08:00
