Forwarded From Old Lady England🇬🇧🇷🇺Rybar writes about the presence of a special department within the British Foreign Office that specializes in countering Russia. The purpose of the organization's functioning is to cause maximum damage and strategic defeat to our country. When studying the structure of the department, we discovered that as a result of reforms, part of the organization was merged with the Directorate of Defense and International Security, whose main task is&nbsp; coordination of the Ministry of Defense and Foreign Affairs on national security issues. As a result of the merger, a division was formed whose area of ​​responsibility includes Russia and Ukraine. Such a structure is the Ukraine Campaign Unit, which is responsible for coordinating various aspects of the Foreign Ministry’s activities in the context of the armed conflict in Ukraine. In general, since November 2022, the British have already reformed the units responsible for foreign policy several times in order to improve their efficiency. Such frequent changes indicate that the British are constantly trying to adapt to new conditions, and this approach ultimately produces results.

Media resources of the Shiite group claim that the target of the attacks was the base of the Northern Command of the Defense Forces Israel and the missile defense system -Iron Dome-. The IDF said most of the missiles were intercepted, while others fell in open areas. However, judging by the fact that in some areas of the city there was a loss of electricity after the incident, critical infrastructure could also have been hit. As for the Israelis, they responded in the usual manner with strikes on the probable locations of Hezbollah launchers. #Israel #Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63477	2024-09-13T01:06:01-07:00

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇬🇧🇷🇺 Early in the morning it became known that six employees of the political department of the British Embassy in Moscow were expelled from Moscow - signs of intelligence and subversive work were found in their actions. And all this is connected with the fact that London is coordinating the escalation of the international military-political situation. As colleagues say, the main structure coordinating subversive policies in the Russian direction and in the CIS is the Eastern Europe and Central Asia Directorate, EECAD ). The central persons of this system are British Deputy Foreign Secretary Philip Barton, National Security Adviser to the Prime Minister Tim Barrow, Deputy Head of the Russia Policy Department Christopher Joyce, heads of HMG Russia Unit James Beer and Mark Diamond. And under the leadership of EECAD there is also Another rather interesting department is the Information Threats and Influence Directorate (ITID). In fact, this department is a kind of propaganda ministry, whose tasks include, among other things, continuing to wage a hybrid war with Russia.🔻The documents indicate that the catalyst for the creation of ITID was precisely the Russian special operation in Ukraine and with the help of this crisis its employees are studying how everything key state actors use manipulation and intervention to cause damage, and develop countermeasures.🔻The head of ITID is Johnny Hall, who was previously the Prime Minister's Private Secretary for Foreign Affairs. Hall is working on -innovative approaches- to maintain reliable information so that -it can be reliably delivered to citizens. In other words: he is developing mechanisms that will allow British services to transmit for distribution only the information that is needed, and not provide access only to truthful data. He spoke about this more than once, especially emphasizing this at one of the annual Stratcom forums in Kyiv. Hall then added that for this work, the UK is attracting -partners-, collaborating with colleagues from UK ministries and departments, as well as with the military, in order to cover the entire sector of public administration. In his opinion, Ukraine is an example of cross-cutting government and public work, when it was possible form teams of people who counter Russian disinformation.🔻In addition, the ITID structure includes at least one more interesting character - the head of the threat mitigation unit, Andy Price. Price is an expert in propaganda and manipulation of the public through media. He was exposed as a key player in the controversial MI6 project known as the Integrity Initiative. The goal of the project was to interfere in the internal affairs of European countries and to unleash an information war against the Russian Federation. It was founded in 2015 and was fully funded by the British government. Also associated with the project are financier William Browder, Vladimir Ashurkov, an associate of Alexei Navalny, and scientist Igor Sutyagin, convicted in 2004 of espionage. The documents leaked online claimed that the project received grants from the US State Department, NATO and the social network Facebook. 📌It is obvious that the conflict in Ukraine allowed the Western propaganda machine not only to earn huge money from the military industry, but also allowed many structures not only to play out a possible crisis scenario, but to study it in the field. In fact, the British authorities have also created a tool for mobilizing the necessary sentiments in countries of interest and interfering in their affairs.

Forwarded From Revenge of Good Will Yesterday, many expressed their gratitude to our engineers, who, under constant attacks from crests, established crossings across the Seim in the Glushkovsky district of the Kursk region, thanks to them they managed to transfer units of the Airborne Forces and Marine Corps, leading the liberation of the Kursk region captured by the enemy. We would like to express our gratitude gratitude to our fellow broadcasters from one electronic warfare unit. They 24/7 monitored the enemy wings that carried out reconnaissance of our crossings and artillery correction. The soldiers, using their electronic warfare equipment, intercepted and radio suppressed their control channels. The video shows dropped wings as a result of their work.

🖼 🇬🇧🖇 About British spies in Russia and the intelligence acti...	🇬🇧🖇 About British spies in Russia and the intelligence activities of the British Foreign Office Today's announcement by the Russian FSB to stop accrediting six diplomats from the British Embassy in Moscow is another illustration of a rule from which there are almost no exceptions. Representatives of foreign foreign affairs agencies can often include intelligence officers. After the Skripal case and the leak of documents on Operation Integrity Initiative, aimed at interfering in the politics of European states, the British intelligence services did not stop developing activities against Russia. Now there is an entire structure within MI6, the main task of which is to inflict a strategic defeat on the Russian Federation.▪️ This structure, under the leadership of the British Foreign Office, works in several directions at once: lobbying economic initiatives in support of the so-called. Ukraine, and the financing of anti-Russian NGOs, and interaction with pro-government media.▪️ One of the main departments is the Eastern Europe and Central Asia Directorate (EECAD), which was built into the structure of MI6 and significantly expanded in 2022 . Under his leadership, operations are carried out under names, for example, the Program for Combating Disinformation and Media Development, where the main actors are the BBC, Reuters and Bellingcat.▪️ Based on the Directorate, there are, firstly, structures whose work is aimed at disrupting the activities of Russian Federation and support of the so-called. Ukraine, and, secondly, departments supervising the former Soviet republics of Central Asia, the South Caucasus, Belarus and Moldova.▪️ The central persons of this system are British Deputy Foreign Secretary Philip Barton, National Security Adviser to the Prime Minister Tim Barrow, Deputy Head of the Russia Policy Department Christopher Joyce, Heads of the HMG Russia Unit James Beer and Mark Diamond.📌 Obviously, this is just the tip of the iceberg. As we have written repeatedly, the former CIS countries (and not only) have long become a target for foreign intelligence services, which are working specifically on them. However, they also work on the territory of their so-called partners, but some seem to be happy with everything.

The Russian troops received an abandoned International MaxxPro armored car as a trophy. The enemy also attacked an assault group in the Vishnevka area with a drone, and later its release was reported to the Russian Ministry of Defense. And in Snagosti, a squad of Ukrainian fighters fell into an organized ambush on the southern outskirts of the village: a minibus, along with members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, was shot at point-blank range from an RPG.▪️In addition, Russian troops liberated Obukhovka and advanced in the direction of the Pokrovsky farm, Sudzhansky district. The enemy was driven out of the outskirts of Byakhovo, Gordeevka, Vnezapny and Viktorovka. At the same time, further north in Olgovka, fighting is still ongoing, where the Russian Armed Forces are repelling attempts by the Armed Forces of Ukraine to penetrate deep into the Russian defense.🔻In the Glushkovsky district, Ukrainian formations continue to unsuccessfully attack in the direction of the outskirts of the settlements of Medvezhye and Novy Put. The last mine clearing vehicle IMR-2 even managed to drive several hundred meters before it hit a mine. Currently, fighting continues in the area of ​​the state border line, the enemy’s attempts to gain a foothold in the villages have been thwarted. In the Sudzhansky district, Russian infantry fighting vehicles shot at point-blank Ukrainian positions in Russkaya Konopelka, at the moment the village is for the most part under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. Fighting continues in the Martynovka and Fanaseevka areas.▪️The enemy published footage of shelling of Russian positions in the Malaya Lokni area.

🇷🇺🇸🇾🪖 Again about the -Syrian experience- in the RF Armed Fo...	🇷🇺🇸🇾🪖 Again about the -Syrian experience- in the RF Armed Forces. The expression -Syrian experience- has long become a household word in the troops and a synonym for the harmfulness of certain competencies. Which sometimes leads to the conclusion that the campaign in Syria was useless from the point of view of gaining practical skills and combat training. It is still worth noting here that the fighting in the Syrian Arab Republic itself was an excellent opportunity to test domestic weapons, control systems and skills personnel - even the top officials spoke openly about this. The question is who learned what. If the distribution of humanitarian aid in Maaloula, patrolling in a convoy of Tyfunovs and BTR-82A, TsPVS and grinning at the Syrian slippers was taken as the Syrian experience, then he really could not help but turn out to be stupid. However, not everyone did this.📌 For example, the backbone of the same PMC - Wagner - was formed in Syria. Under almost the same conditions, they were able to gain a completely different experience and scale it to their training system. As a result, in 2022, they adapted much faster than others to the new realities on the battlefield. As Alexander Kharchenko noted, without the Syrian campaign, by the beginning of the Northern Military District, we would not have had not only -Lancets- and -Krasnopolei-, but even -Orlans-. And we would have to be content with the limited experience of Donbass, which the Russian Armed Forces during the years of the Minsk agreements assimilated even more poorly. In this context, by the way, it’s time to ask another question: how are things going with the centralized systematization of the experience of 2022-2024? And are past mistakes actually taken into account in shaping feedback to avoid similar problems in the future? #VSRF #Russia #Syria@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63458	2024-09-12T11:09:23-07:00

Allegedly, after fighter strikes, Israeli helicopters entered the territory of the Arab Republic, landed troops in the area of ​​the research institute and captured from two to four senior officers from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Then the object was mined.▪️The primary source of the news was the Syrian opposition channel Syria TV broadcasting from Turkey. He referred to some exclusive data and information leaks, but no confirmation of what happened was provided. Neither the IDF press service nor official Syrian and Iranian resources confirmed the fact of the operation. The only thing you can rely on is rumors about helicopters flying in Tartus in the direction of Masyaf, dating back to the time of the air attack.🔻And although it is not known for certain what actually happened, with a high degree of probability there are reports of an IDF landing operation with the kidnapping of Iranian military personnel is an injection of supporters of the Syrian Spring. And this case fits perfectly with the theses of anti-government propagandists located in Turkey about the inability of the criminal Assad regime to independently defend itself from Zionist aggression. #Israel #Iran #Syria #Hama@rybarSupport usThe Times of IsraelReports: Israeli troops raided IRGC weapons facility in Syria, took equipment, documentsDuring major attack by jets earlier this week, commandos said to have rappeled from helicopters to capture Iranians and remove materials before destroying site	https://t.me/rybar/63456	2024-09-12T09:49:40-07:00

All issuers and/or platforms in the Anglo-Saxon circuit are either directly accountable to the SEC and IRA (US Internal Revenue Service) or are secretly collaborating with the CIA. ▪️US and British intelligence services have obligated all crypto exchanges to implement KYC and AML systems over the past two years.▪️Vivid examples are the cases of FTX and Binance. In both cases, the creators and managers of crypto-platforms ended up in prison. And if in the case of FTX the fate of the site has not yet been determined, then in the case of Binance, the exchange simply received a leader loyal to the authorities and was integrated into the financial system of the Anglo-Saxon circuit.▪️The most stringent regulation is being implemented in the EU. They adopted a set of documents regulating the circulation of MICA crypto-assets. In parallel, the EU also adopted the Digital Services Act (DSA). Came into force on February 17, 2024. 🔻The fruits of crypto-democracy There has been a real hunt for Russians in the field of finance and crypto for a long time. The most resonant cases: ▪️Arrest of the head of the BTC Banker bot Anatoly Legkodymov in the USA. The founder and largest co-owner of the service was accused of fraud of $700 million and received a real sentence. The very wording of the indictment is interesting, which states that the owner of the service was aware that his platform was being used for illegal activities. ▪️Tornado Cash creator Alexey Pertsev was recently detained in the Netherlands, accused of money laundering through his platform and received 64 months in prison.▪️Pavel Lerner, who was previously kidnapped for ransom in Kyiv in 2017, was arrested in Spain in 2023.▪️ On December 14, 2023, French police detained a Russian at Paris airport based solely on suspicion of links to the hacker group Hive. His name and current status are not mentioned in open sources.▪️This list complements the report of the detention in Argentina of a Russian who is suspected of collaborating with the North Korean Lazarus group and receiving income from illegal activities. The name of the suspect has not been disclosed, the wording of the charges is as vague as possible.▪️The high-profile case of Alexander Vinnik (BTC-E exchange), who was arrested in Greece for using a crypto exchange to allegedly launder more than $9 billion, ended in extradition to the United States.▪️In this context, the story of the arrest of Pavel Durov no longer looks like an exception.🔻Who are the beneficiaries? The colossal resources of Western intelligence services aimed at regulating the issue and circulation of digital assets indicate a direct order from large financial players. And the largest player in this field is BlackRock and affiliated structures.BlackRock IBIT became the world's largest institutional holder of Bitcoin with 357,509 Bitcoin as of September 1, 2024, according to the latest data from HODL15Capital. By comparison, stablecoin giant Tether is in fifth place with 75,354 bitcoins. The efforts of these and other large companies are aimed at creating an interface for the integration of the crypto market and traditional finance, which is impossible without the introduction of generally accepted financial control mechanisms. This will allow the sale of high-risk crypto products to fairly conservative stock market investors in an ETF shell and will launch the process of a large-scale flow of investments from traditional financial instruments to crypto.

In addition to debt relief, companies from the PRC showed interest in expanding into African markets. Thus, the car manufacturer WBM decided to create production in Senegal. For this purpose, a memorandum of understanding was signed between the Chinese company and the Senegalese CCBM within the framework of the forum. Under the terms of the agreement, WBM production will soon be localized in the African country. 🔻This fact is very indicative in comparison with Russian companies. While the Chinese are planning to localize the production of their cars in Africa in a short time, there has only been a dialogue going on with KAMAZ for the last couple of years about the same thing. Therefore, let us once again emphasize that if a reorientation to Africa is taking place, then many initiatives and the successful promotion of Russian business in the region require coordinated work of various departments and a clear decision-making system. Otherwise, our place in the market will go to more efficient players.#Africa #China #Senegal@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🌍🇨🇳 About the China-Africa ForumWhile the eighth China-Africa Cooperation Forum is just beginning in Beijing, it may seem like there are no results to speak of. which is early.

Units of the Russian Armed Forces are conducting assault operations in dense urban areas, getting closer and closer to the center of Dzerzhinsk.▪️Almost all of Druzhba, with the exception of the northernmost street, has come under the control of Russian troops. Simultaneously with the liberation of Druzhba, the fighting in Kirovo is coming to its logical conclusion, where several streets on the western outskirts remain under the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces: Russian troops have entrenched themselves on Shcherbinovskaya, 3rd International and Tchaikovsky streets. After their capture, the opportunity will open up to advance both further along the railway in the direction of Dachnoye and to the southwest, taking the enemy garrison in Dzerzhinsk in pincers from the flank.▪️To the south there are battles in Dzerzhinsk. Russian troops took control of microdistrict No. 1 at the entrance to the city, occupied the territory of the penal colony and the local bakery. At the same time, there has not yet been any information about the occupation of positions on the waste heap of the Novaya mine. Control over the height will provide an overview of the adjacent forest to the southwest of the mine.▪️The Ukrainian command transferred the 12th brigade of the NGU -Azov- to the Novgorodsky (New York) area. The Ukrainian formations that arrived to strengthen their positions immediately posted footage of their work on the Internet, thanks to which it was possible to establish that Russian troops control at least 60% of Nelepovka.🔻A notable event of the week was also the confrontation - flag dumps - on the territory of the elevator of the phenol plant in Novgorod. First, Ukrainian formations from the 53rd ombre posted footage of their flag attached to a magnet. And then Russian troops published the moment the flag was dropped from an FPV drone in the same place. Afterwards, another video appeared, this time from the ground, where a fighter was planting a flag on one of the outer houses at the exit from Novgorodskoye. At the moment, the village is entirely under the control of the Russian Armed Forces.

And although for now the position of Ukrainian formations in this direction remains relatively stable, Russian troops continue to methodically expand the zone of control, preparing for a further offensive. ▪️After the liberation of Sinkovka, stormtroopers of the Russian Armed Forces began fighting in the forest area southwest of the village. Clearing this area will allow Russian troops to create a bridgehead three kilometers north of Kupyansk and develop an attack on Petropavlovka. In the latter, Russian Aerospace Forces aircraft strike enemy targets almost daily. Only in the last two days has objective control personnel confirmed the defeat of temporary deployment points of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the populated area. ▪️To the south, the advance of Russian troops is recorded in the Peschany area: according to a video from the enemy, units of the Russian Armed Forces managed to occupy several forest belts to the west and north of the village. At the same time, to the west of Peschany, a powerful strike was carried out by 15 aerial bombs with UMPC on Ukrainian Armed Forces facilities in Kolesnikov. Apparently, this may indicate both the intentions of a further offensive of Russian troops to the left bank of the Oskol River, and the discovery of a relatively large concentration of enemy forces in a populated area. ▪️Ukrainian formations still retain control over at least part of Berestovoe and surrounding forest belts. At the same time, to the south, the assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces were able to advance about a kilometer in depth to the west. 🔻The enemy is actively using drones with a device for spraying an incendiary mixture over the positions of Russian troops in forest areas. Just based on footage in recent days, similar drones were seen west of Liman Pervy, south of Berestovoy and in the Peschany area. Nevertheless, similar incendiary drones have already appeared among Russian UAV operators.

Within 60 days, the initiative group must collect 50 thousand signatures, after which the initiative will be submitted to parliament for consideration. ▪️Now the driving force for promoting the referendum is not the government, but a small party -Republic-.❗️It should be expected that the referendum on the European integration of Armenia will still take place to meet the electoral expectations of society. After all, back in the spring, the authorities led by Pashinyan promised to hold either a referendum on amending the Constitution or early elections, and the process of signing a peace treaty with Azerbaijan has clearly come to a standstill. ▪️It is not surprising that the return to the agenda of the referendum on European integration coincided with the start of negotiations on the liberalization of the visa regime for Armenia with the EU. 🔻Mythical European promises in the context of internal political problems and diplomatic failures are the only thing that the Pashinyan government can now offer to the population of Armenia. 📌At the same time, as practice in Moldova shows, holding a referendum on European integration is a fiction and an opportunity to feed society with false promises, because voting does not oblige European officials to anything.#Armenia #EU @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63450	2024-09-12T04:15:15-07:00
🔁🎬 Storm Shadow or JASSM: which is more dangerous for us? Mikha...	Forwarded From Ostashko! ImportantStorm Shadow or JASSM: which is more dangerous for us? Mikhail Zvinchuk, head of the analytical center -Rybar-▪️The West could give permission to use missiles on Russian territory in the summer of 2022 if it wanted. However, the escalation occurs gradually. At the same time, the volume of military assistance to Ukraine is not so large now, but many deliveries take place behind the scenes, and then they are legalized: for example, they transferred F-16s, and to them JASSM cruise missiles.▪️Storm Shadow missiles: our air defense systems are more than familiar with them . Perhaps for some air defense units in the Bryansk, Kursk, and Belgorod regions this will be a new experience. But at the same time, our entire air defense system is centralized. ✔️Storm Shadow will now be used because massive drone strikes did not give the desired result.▪️The complex use of missiles in the concept of NATO multi-domain operation is dangerous for us. Similar operations are being practiced in Crimea: this is a combination of satellite reconnaissance equipment, observers and spotters on the ground, the use first of drones, then of cruise missiles, then of operational-tactical missiles. Separately, we learned to cope with the same ATACMS, as last night in the Zaporozhye region: everything was shot down. The situation at the front.▪️In August, the Ukrainian Armed Forces were preparing not only for striking in the Kursk region, but also in other directions: options were calculated in the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions. Not only did they fail to implement the plan for the first 10-20 days, they were forced to withdraw reserves that were preparing for this offensive.▪️We also see that the Ukrainian Armed Forces are now throwing unprepared units into the DPR, which would have to recapture the same Ukrainsk or defend Selidovo. It seems that the Ukrainian formations are gradually surrendering to the DPR.▪️Of course, we have a huge, hard job ahead of us, but now we are actually tearing apart the front that has stood for a long time. Our troops are approaching Mirnograd and Pokrovsk. We are approaching Kurakhovo from the north, gradually tightening the ring around the group north of Krasnogorovka. The fighting near Ugledar has now intensified.▪️The rest of the front is relatively stable. In the Svatovo-Kupyansk direction there is still a positional struggle, as well as near Seversk. In the Orekhovsky and Kherson areas too. ▪️But the Armed Forces of Ukraine do not give up attempts to probe our defenses at unexpected points and try to study our tactics. Yesterday's attempt to land on gas fields in the Black Sea is not such an unsuccessful operation: Ukrainian forces and British SAS instructors and advisers, who are obsessed with conducting naval operations, are studying the tactics of Russian troops' response. And they get answers. A game is being played where the bargaining chip is Ukrainian cannon fodder.#important Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/63449	2024-09-12T03:02:12-07:00

As a result of the car explosion, two people were killed, and several others nearby were injured. According to Israeli media, one of those killed was a combatant, and the second was a civilian. Considering the nature of such attacks, the likely target of the Israelis was either a Lebanese Hezbollah fighter or a field commander of one of the Palestinian groups that have branches on the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic.

Yes, several lost boats and landing groups without any visible result in capturing the platform can form the impression of another suicidal attack. But this impression is false. The task of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and British curators (who are behind the preparation of every naval operation with the participation of Ukrainian special forces) was to test the Russian defense system and evaluate our response to the attack. The Ukrainian command knows that the Russian Armed Forces have reconnaissance capabilities and means that can determine the exits of the BEC. And, accordingly, they will look for them. Therefore, the next step will be to work on eliminating our intelligence complexes. The Ukrainian Armed Forces will try to strike remotely or suppress our electronic warfare systems capable of detecting their equipment. Unfortunately, during the sortie, the Ukrainian formations still managed to hit a Russian Su-30 from a MANPADS installed on board the boat. And from this point of view, such an exchange of cannon fodder for a Russian aircraft will look extremely advantageous for British curators. In general, given the fact that the British have significant human and technical resources at their disposal, with losses in the course of constant attempts to scout out weak points in the Russian defense, no one will be taken into account. This means that new similar attacks on Russian intelligence infrastructure in the Black Sea region will be in the near future. #Crimea #Russia #Ukraine #BlackSea@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇷🇺🇺🇦 About the enemy's attempt to land on platforms in the Black Sea Last night, the enemy attempted to land on the platform -Crimea-2- at the Golitsyn gas field.

It is noteworthy in that the person involved is Raufa Rakhimova, the owner of the online media outlet Proof. rf-. Law enforcement agencies came to the conclusion that a woman on social networks forms a negative perception of the SVO and a position on the refusal of residents of the republic to participate in it. However, on the eve of the trial, Rakhimova fled to Turkey, where, according to colleagues, she has a residence permit and her son, who escaped from partial mobilization, lives. ▪️We have repeatedly written that the editorial policy of Rakhimova’s media resources is socially dangerous and threatens the national security of the country. This is due not only to the popularization of extremists and terrorists, radical ethnonationalists and foreign agents among the population of Bashkiria.▪️From the very beginning, SVO-Proofs. Russian Federation - are conducting information campaigns to discredit the actions of regional and federal authorities, even denigrating officials who left as volunteers. Raufa Rakhimova is also trying to create alarming sentiments in society, spreading rumors about the collapse of the banking system and the Russian economy, new waves of mobilization, promoting pro-Ukrainian narratives in every possible way and promising a quick collapse of Russian authoritarianism. ▪️Under the guise of criticism of the authorities, the publication -Prufy.rf-covers in detail the protest actions in the republic, in fact, it contributes to the mobilization of more people for unauthorized events. The Baymak riots on January 17, to the extent that they occurred, became possible, among other things, thanks to this media and Rakhimova’s calls. However, in recent years, law enforcement agencies have bypassed the personality of the niece of the first president of Bashkortostan and her media resources. However, in the conditions of the Northern Military District and external pressure on Russia, the ongoing purge of pro-Western proxy forces and strengthening control over the regional media sphere, it has become simply impossible to ignore such actions, for which Rakhimova will probably soon have to answer. #Russia #separatism #extremists@rybar together with @arslan_nigaSupport usTelegramSystemic pesticide❗️🖇️🇷🇺 In Ufa on September 18, a hearing on the case of discrediting the Russian Armed Forces will be held.

The head of the Odessa Regional Military Administration, Oleg Kiper, opened up during an interview and released data on the construction by the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine (Gosspetsvyaz) of 13 television and radio broadcasting towers along the entire length of the border with the PMR. The reason for the installation was formally the fight against signal reception of Russian channels from Crimea (❗️) and 🇷🇴Romanian broadcasts in the Odessa region. In fact, an increase in information impact on the residents of Transnistria through anti-Russian TV channels and radio is expected. Before the Northeast Military District, Ukraine, within the framework of the Strategy for Information Reintegration of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, in the Kherson region also deployed infrastructure for disseminating its propaganda to Crimea. In total, they managed to install 5 towers in border settlements (Vasilievka, Novotroitskoye, Chongar, Chaplinka and Genichesk), transmitting 20 TV channels and 7 radio stations. The active participation in this process of the United States Agency for International Cooperation (USAID), which donated 3 sets of equipment for towers in the Kherson region, is indicative.✨Interest in increasing information capabilities to influence Transnistria is associated primarily with the upcoming presidential elections in Moldova on October 20, as well as referendum on joining the EU. The West is using all available resources to oust Russia from the region and create a split in society in order to use this to implement scenarios beneficial to itself.

It is through him that they are passing all the money comes from oil revenues, so he is an important link in the political struggle between factions. It all started when, at the end of August, armed people broke into the Central Bank building in Tripoli and installed their deputy chairman. Of course, this news was picked up by all news agencies and began to spread panic among the Libyans and the West.❗️The most interesting thing about this is that the Central Bank building is just a screen, and real power is in the hands of those who have access to the electronic system. Its management is in the hands of the Turkish protege Siddiq al-Kabir.▪️But the trick was a success - the chairman of the Central Bank left the country, and the Americans announced the suspension of financial transactions between the countries. And oil exports from western Libya were suspended due to increased risks and confusion. And at the moment it is extremely limited.🔻Probably this incident was organized at the instigation of the eastern government in order to take over the Central Bank. Actually, control over it means for Haftar supremacy in Libya, because oil revenues are the main one for the country. And the recent strengthening of the Libyan National Army in different parts of the country only emphasizes the ambitions of the leadership in Benghazi to strengthen its position in the country.

The tense situation remains in Beit Lahia amid Israeli media reports about the need to evacuate the village. In the central part of the enclave, IDF engineering work is underway in the Netzarim corridor, where the terrain is being leveled and defensive structures are being built. Israeli strikes on Hamas-controlled settlements also continue unabated. In the south of the Gaza Strip, Israeli troops worked on Khan Yunis and its suburbs. And in Rafah, a Black Hawk helicopter crashed: two soldiers of the elite evacuation unit-669 were killed, eight more were injured. An operation by Israeli security forces called -Summer Camps- has been going on in the West Bank for more than two weeks. The most violent clashes occurred in Tulkarm, Nablus and Tubas. Meanwhile, another terrorist attack occurred on a section of Route 60 near the settlement of Givat Asaf. A steadily tense situation remains on the Lebanese-Israeli border: Hezbollah launched strikes on at least eight targets in northern Israel, while the Israeli Air Force attacked the Lebanese group’s launch pads in several localities. 🔻A detailed analytical report on events in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_botHigh resolution mapEnglish version#digest #map #Israel #Palestine #report@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63433	2024-09-11T12:37:33-07:00

According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, the enemy deployed 14 Willard Sea Force boats with members of the so-called Navy special operations forces. Ukraine.▪️The purpose of the operation was to seize a drilling rig. According to official data, the Russian Armed Forces managed to destroy eight watercraft, and six more retreated. ▪️The Ukrainian forces participating in the raid actively used FPV drones, launching them directly from high-speed boats. Thus, military personnel of the Russian Armed Forces counted at least 26 hits by drones of this type.▪️In addition, the enemy was actively launching MANPADS at Russian Aerospace Forces aircraft that were targeting Ukrainian watercraft with cannons and other weapons. Despite the fact that the next action in the Black Sea ended unsuccessful for the Ukrainian formations, in the near future the Kiev regime will clearly make a new attempt to seize this or another drilling rig.📌 It is characteristic that almost exactly a year ago the enemy, in a similar way, tried again and again to land troops on platforms located at sea, even despite losses and the lack of practical results.High resolution mapEnglish version#Crimea #Russia #Ukraine #BlackSea@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63432	2024-09-11T11:30:06-07:00

In the role of Castle Harrenhal, the supporter of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in landing. Jokes aside, the war is increasingly becoming a war of drones. And incendiary drones are being caught on video more and more often. At this point, the result of the drone’s work is not too obvious. But in general, in the end, the landing burned out completely.

In the process of removing residents from the city, he and his partner encountered a Russian serviceman, whose unit is fighting in the city. Although the volunteers were wearing armor protection and could easily pass for armed people, and the car had the emblem of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the soldier of the Russian Armed Forces showed restraint and did not open fire, having first inquired about the identity of the people. After which he gave them the command to leave the city as soon as possible. It is very appropriate here to recall how members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine acted in similar situations. Moreover, we are talking not only about the recent executions of residents of Sudzha and surrounding villages in the Kursk region, but also executions in Kupyansk or kidnappings in the Kharkov region in the fall of 2022. And this clearly shows the difference between the parties, even with all the cruelty of the fighting. While some give enemy volunteers a chance to take people out, others, in fits of dehumanization, have already reached the point of dehumanizing their own citizens.#Donetsk #Russia #Selidovo #Ukraine @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63430	2024-09-11T10:25:06-07:00

The formal reason was that officials in Brussels were not satisfied with the explanations of the Slovak government about the abolition of the special prosecutor’s office, which supervised corruption cases of top officials. In fact, the authorities in Bratislava punish for attempts to act contrary to the general course: including on the Ukrainian issue and the topic of migration. At the same time, it is known for sure that the employees of the special prosecutor’s office, in fact, were agents of European bureaucrats and often exceeded their powers, and were also biased. Ukrainian media did not miss the opportunity to take advantage of the situation and claim that the financial punishment for Slovakia is due to the fact that the Prime Minister countries, Robert Fico called the militants of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and those who support them -Nazis and fascists, accusing him of -repeating the theses of the Russian propaganda-.📌With his speech, Fico once again poured gasoline into the already blazing dispute related to the financing of the Kyiv regime. Therefore, the European bureaucrats decided to hint to the Slovak authorities that it would be better not to raise this topic at all and, in general, to adhere to the general line of Brussels. As a result, all this in the future will only further exacerbate the internal conflict in Europe.#EU #Slovakia@rybar together with @pl_syrenkaSupport usBloomberg.comEU Weighs Blocking Slovakia Funds Over Democratic BackslidingThe European Union is working on a proposal to censure Slovakia over the erosion of democratic norms in a move that could result in the block with holding funds earmarked for Bratislava.	https://t.me/rybar/63429	2024-09-11T09:34:33-07:00

The German publication Bild cited the words of members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine complaining that most of the German, Dutch and Italian howitzers are broken and cannot be repaired. Such statements in the Western media really have a basis, in contrast to the tearful stories about the huge shortage of manpower in the Kyiv regime . And this applies not only to products from NATO countries: in some brigades of the Ukrainian Armed Forces they had to completely abandon Soviet armored vehicles precisely because of the lack of components. The reason is the same -zoo- of weapons systems, which brought down all unification and seriously complicated logistics for the enemy. Also influenced by the low rate of production of spare parts in the EU countries and bureaucracy, which makes it difficult to promptly replenish the repair fund. Therefore, even new military aid packages with armored vehicles or artillery cannot always fully compensate for losses, and even more so lead to an increase in the firepower of formations - freshly supplied equipment sometimes used for spare parts for -old- cars under repair.#Germany #Italy #Netherlands #Ukraine @rybarSupport usbild.deKeine Ersatzteile: Viele ukrainische Panzerhaubitzen liegen stillDie Bundesregierung verspricht die Lieferung neuer Panzerhaubitzen – doch es fehlen weiterhin Ersatzteile für die bereits Systeme	https://t.me/rybar/63428	2024-09-11T07:45:40-07:00

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇦🇲🇷🇺🇬🇧 How the Russian language is being removed from Armenian schools and what does the British Council have to do with it The Rybar and DTM channels are discussing the news about a significant reduction in the teaching of the Russian language in Armenian schools. ▪️If previously the Russian language in an Armenian school was a compulsory subject for all 12 grades, now it will only be studied for four years. The rest of the time it will be reduced to one of the foreign languages ​​of your choice. ▪️The Russian language will be gradually replaced by English, despite the fundamental ties between Russia and Armenia.▪️The Ministry of Education of Armenia is promoting the widespread penetration of the British British Council into the schools of the republic, which organize -English clubs- with language learning and the art of debate. ▪️Formally, the British Council is engaged in teaching British English and there seems to be nothing wrong with this. However, the organization is directly subordinate to the British Foreign Office and, under the guise of an educational mission, also engages in shadow activities and recruitment. ▪️In 2021, the UK government adopted a concept to promote -Global Britain-. The British Council assigned a key role in it - soft power - in shaping a positive perception of Great Britain in the eyes of young people from different countries. ▪️As the British government indicated, the presence of the British Council in a particular country increases trust in London by 16%, which helps strengthen British influence.🔻The separation of Armenia from Russia, despite the strong economic ties of the countries, will at the same time contribute to the inclusion of the Transcaucasian republic in the emerging Turkic world led by Turkey. And all this is just a UK proxy project. Let’s add to the treasury of facts that the British Council left the Russian Federation back in 2018, when a diplomatic scandal broke out over the Skripal case, which again emphasizes the political, rather than educational, nature of the organization .As we wrote, in February of this year, the FSB of the Russian Federation established that British Council employees were engaged in military intelligence in the Northern Military District zone. In particular, they worked with Ukrainian refugees in Great Britain, through whom they tried to establish contact with residents of the Kherson region for local espionage. In previous years, the British Council in Russia, as the most important part of the British Foreign Office, actively worked with opposition LOMs, who subsequently received status of foreign agents. #Russia #Great Britain #Armenia @pezdicide no chemicals - just facts	https://t.me/rybar/63427	2024-09-11T06:50:28-07:00

Later, footage of flags being hoisted in the center and on the outskirts of the village was published. The enemy is gaining a foothold in the plantings and surroundings of the Yuzhnodonbasskaya mine No. 3, preparing it for defense. According to some reports, Russian troops also took control of the industrial zone of the Stroydetal plant and adjacent dachas.▪️To the south, attack aircraft hoisted a flag on the marque of the Yuzhnodonbasskaya No. 1 mine. In the video, the fighters stood at full height, so the presence of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the area of ​​the nearby waste heap is unlikely. At the moment, the territory of the mine complex is being cleared and infantry groups are being consolidated on the achieved lines.▪️At the same time, the Russian Armed Forces are attacking from Pavlovka to the north, bypassing Ugledar from the flank. The advance group managed to cross the Kashgalach River on motorcycles, where it came under fire from Ukrainian forces. At the moment, the outcome of the battle is unknown.▪️There are also significant successes north of Konstantinovka in the Pobeda area. During the assault by a convoy of armored vehicles on the forest plantations to the west of the village, a landing force was landed, which gained a foothold in the nearest forest belt.

Ukrainian formations regularly fired them across Crimea over the past year, and subsequently they were destroyed in the skies over the Rostov region. Given the lack of any practical use from their use in southern Russia, it was expected that they would begin to be launched in other directions. There was a similar situation with the Neptunes. The range was increased by certain modifications and by getting rid of unnecessary components. For example, they tried to hit the Crimean bridge several times from near Zaporozhye, and in the east of Crimea from Odessa. Of course, the fact that it was shot down over the Tula region is new. But both -Neptunes- and -Tochka-U- caused a stir in their time. Now the time has come for the S-200, the reserves of which have not yet been exhausted by the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and their accuracy is low.#Crimea #Russia #Tula #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63425	2024-09-11T05:15:09-07:00

Because of what sponsors of the so-called. Ukraine was not given the green light to use any supplied weapons at its discretion, although in fact nothing prevented them from doing this back in 2022. At the same time, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have been using Storm Shadow, ATACMS, HIMARS and other types of missile systems for a long time in the DPR, LPR, Crimea, as well as the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions. According to Russian legislation, these regions are no different from others, which some people sometimes forget to remember.📌 At the same time, words about -red lines- from Russian public figures, some of whom, in addition, have nothing to do with decision-making on actions of a military nature.

The employee there was killed, the attacker himself was taken to one from nearby medical facilities. Searches are currently underway at his home in Rafat. Hamas representatives claimed responsibility for the incident: according to them, the attack is a response to the liquidation of five militants by Israeli security forces in Tubas. 📌Similar incidents both in Israel and the Palestinian Authority occur quite regularly: as a rule, heavy truck drivers affiliated with Hamas ram bus stops or clusters of Israeli military personnel. This time the target of the attack was a small observation post with only one person.

In the Kursk direction, the offensive of the Russian Armed Forces in the Korenevsky district continues. According to preliminary data, by morning Obukhovka had been cleared: if the information is confirmed, this will also indicate the liberation of Byakhovo. In addition, Russian paratroopers liberated the tract on October 10, and also occupied and entrenched themselves in Snagosti. During the battle, a group of members of the Ukrainian formations was captured.🔻Against the background of reports of the liberation of Vishnevka, the situation for the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the area is close to deplorable - in Krasnooktyabrskoe and the forest to the north, the enemy had previously gathered personnel and equipment, settling in the forest between the railway and the river Sejm. Closer to noon, the Russian Armed Forces cleared Apanasovka, finally forming a cauldron. There are also battles in the vicinity of Olgovka and Kremyany. According to some reports, Russian troops have also launched an offensive here, although its results currently remain unknown. Clashes continue in the Sudzhansky district. According to incoming reports, Russian troops attacked at the Pogrebki-Kamyshevka line in the direction of Malaya Loknya, but the scale of the advance is not yet clear, and there have been no reports of the liberation of populated areas.

Only recently did Air Force training over Indian territory - Tarang Shakti - end. Almost at the same time, the Indians participated in the Pitch Black exercise in Australia. And now there are also participants from India in Kakadu training. This year, bilateral exercises were also held between India and the United States with the participation of American B-52H bombers, and last year B-1B aircraft were even based for a short time in India.🔻The point is , that no matter how much India talks about distancing itself from all regional conflicts, strained relations with China and the growing appetites of the Celestial Empire force it to react in such a simple way. Yesterday, on the border with Pakistan at the Mahajan training ground, the bilateral Yudh Abhyas exercise of the US and Indian ground forces began the use of battalion tactical groups in difficult terrain in special operations. Unlike previous years, this year the scale of training has increased. From the usual tactical maneuvers by infantry units, this time they are using HIMARS MLRS and even Stryker armored personnel carriers, which New Delhi is considering as an option to replace the BMP-2. Of course, in India all this is presented as a standard planned event, but we don’t think that in Beijing it will be regarded so friendly. The number of exercises is growing, and India is becoming an increasingly frequent participant, so the reaction will be quite logical. A few weeks ago, when the Indians conducted one of the exercises with Western countries, the Chinese sent their H-6K bombers to the contested regions, which is possible this once under the pretext of some teaching.

Neither candidate won a landslide victory - Trump defended himself well, without resorting to personal insults to his opponent, and Harris limited herself to populist statements and attacks, without making serious mistakes. However, the scales, contrary to statements from the local press, still swung in the direction Trump: Harris' allies in Congress admitted she was -weaker on the economy.- At the same time, they noted that the ex-president performed poorly on issues related to women's issues.▪️The discussion about abortion was indeed the most tense moment of the debate for Trump - Harris accused him of seeking to establish government control over the female body. However, Trump fought back well, declaring that the Democrats are executioners of children whom they plan to allow to be killed even in the 9th month of pregnancy, and compared this to a capital punishment sentence.▪️After the end of the event, the media sympathetic to the Democrats, for lack of anything else, latched on to the allegedly false statement Trump that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio are eating pets out of poverty. However, facts confirming this quickly spread on social network X.▪️ On the issue of foreign policy and in particular the conflict on the so-called. The parties did not say anything new to Ukraine - Trump spoke in favor of speedy negotiations, and Harris made it clear to everyone that she and her party would continue to advocate war until the last Ukrainian. ▪️As a result of the debate, the press launched a massive information campaign to support Harris: CNN and The Washington Post gave her victory, and to enhance the media effect, the Democrats even brought up heavy artillery - singer Taylor Swift published a post in which she supported Trump’s opponent. At the same time, there is simply no significant evidence of Harris’s triumph, and the arguments in favor of this look like an attempt to -pull an owl onto the globe.- Ultimately, there is a completely reasonable explanation for the behavior of the Democrats - there is no one else to replace Kamala with, so until November they will have to work with what they have. So, an intense struggle between the candidates is guaranteed in the foreseeable future, since the honeymoon of Harris has approached end - judging by the latest polls, Donald Trump is again on the heels of the Democrats. #USA@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport usTelegramAmerican number🇺🇸🎙Judging by inside information, in Congress, Harris' party members consider her performance -normal-, however, they admit that she - was weaker in economic matters.

Only after public outcry did they promise to correct the text. ➖In other history textbooks, Armenian toponyms were replaced with Turkic ones, and even pickets at the Ministry of Education did not affect their removal.▪️Such trends in school education in Armenia are not surprising, because Minister Andreasyan, like many members of Nikol Pashinyan’s team, left the cohort of foundation experts Soros -Open Society-. ▪️Even before 2018, Andreasyan participated in educational projects that taught Armenians about LGBT and religious minorities. Now figures with dubious experience have headed entire departments that are destroying Armenian sovereignty. An attempt to -solve- the language issue is a traditional practice of Western agents in the post-Soviet space to sever cultural ties between the former Soviet republics and Russia.

In the south of the enclave, the Israel Defense Forces carried out at least five airstrikes on refugee tents in al-Mawasi. According to IDF representatives, the need for the strikes was due to the destruction of Hamas militants hiding in the camp. In the West Bank, Israeli security forces prevented several terrorist attacks, detaining more than 20 people within two days, and a shipment of smuggled weapons was seized at the Rabin checkpoint near Eilat. The tense situation remains on the Lebanese-Israeli border. In Lebanon, as a result of an Israeli drone strike on a car, the commander of one of Hezbollah's elite units was killed.🔻A detailed analytical report on events in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_botHigh resolution mapEnglish version#digest #map #Israel # Palestine #report@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63412	2024-09-10T12:46:18-07:00

Some units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the area are under threat of encirclement, while the advanced groups of Russian troops continue to advance both to the south and to the east. On the border of the Glushkovsky and Korenevsky districts, units of the 155th Marine Brigade and the 51st Guards Parachute The airborne regiment launched a counteroffensive at the Gordeevka - Snagost line. ▪️To the north of the latter, Russian paratroopers made significant progress, taking control of the approaches to the village and entering its territory. According to reports from the field, Ukrainian forces withdrew some of the units from the settlement, but its current status is still unknown. ❗️As a result of the successful actions of the Russian Armed Forces, there is a threat of encirclement of enemy units located in the Krasnooktyabrsky area and the nearby forest. Already now, the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is faced with a choice - to transfer reserves from another direction to hold positions in the Korenevsky region or to withdraw troops in order to avoid their encirclement. ▪️To the south, Russian attack aircraft knocked out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from some positions in Apanasovka and its environs. Our sources do not confirm the complete liberation of the settlement, however, in light of successes in other areas, the position of the Ukrainian formations defending there may become significantly more complicated in the near future. ▪️In the area of ​​the tract, on October 10, units of the Russian Armed Forces carried out a successful attack, knocking out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from several positions in the area of ​​the settlement. It is not possible to assess the scale of the promotion due to the lack of personnel from the field. ▪️Also, Russian troops, during a series of attacks, knocked out the enemy from several positions north and south of Byakhovo, taking the enemy units there into a semi-encirclement. At the moment, the village is rather in a gray zone; it is not possible to confirm information about its release. ▪️Units of the Russian Armed Forces liberated Vnezapne and Gordeevka, and also started fighting for Viktorovka. In the latter, at the moment, according to information from the field, the presence of Ukrainian formations may remain. Nevertheless, they are also under the threat of semi-encirclement, which makes it likely that the village will come under the control of the Russian Armed Forces in the near future. 🔻The situation in the Sudzhansky district has not undergone significant changes. Ukrainian formations launched several attacks in the area of ​​Cherkasy Konopelka, Kamyshevka, Maryevka and Borok, but were not successful.

Forwarded From Operational reports❗️ Nizhny Novgorod law enforcement officers came to the attention of a local stand-up comedian and blogger, Dima Gavrilov, who, frightened by mobilization, fled to Georgia for a long time. There he blabbed a lot of unnecessary things, pleasing the Tbilisi local audience with Russophobic jokes (see the clip of his -jokes-). After a while, Dmitry, by the way, a reserve officer of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, decided to return to touring Russia. During this process, the keen eye of the Nizhny Novgorod law enforcement agencies did not ignore the creativity of the fellow countryman. Further according to the classics - detention and repentance for sins, cancellation of the tour. On September 8, Gavrilov wanted to hold a whole concert at the concert venue -DKRT-. But alas, before the concert the comedian was detained and by a court decision found guilty of committing an administrative offense under Art. 20.3.1 Code of Administrative Offenses of the Russian Federation. He was sentenced to 13 days of administrative arrest. From now on, he and his colleagues will think about what is acceptable to joke about and what is unacceptable! Unfortunately, many such broadcasters and bloggers are replacing freedom of expression with permissiveness! Now Dima personally has 13 days to think about a new repertoire.🎯 @opersvodki	https://t.me/rybar/63408	2024-09-10T11:30:45-07:00

Their use by enemy intelligence services was a matter of time, which we mentioned a year and a half ago. In the conditions of an uncontrolled influx of migrants, a whole layer of alien and extremely disloyal elements have actually formed in the country, creating structures parallel to the state. This opened up enormous opportunities for the enemy for recruitment with the subsequent creation of entire intelligence networks. So far, everything most often comes down to recording the results of strikes and filming strategic objects on assignment. However, who said that Kiev would not want to try to repeat what happened in Crocus in the spring, or organize migrant protests and riots? Tightening migration policy today and rethinking outdated Soviet narratives is not a whim.

Negotiations between the leaders were probably the last - the fact is that at the end of September in Japan there will be elections for the leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, in which Kishida is not taking part. At the meeting, grandiloquent statements were made about the importance of further development of relations between Tokyo and Seoul. Let us recall that the rapprochement of the countries began under pressure from Washington in March 2023 and not without enthusiasm on the part of the South Korean leader. The future of bilateral ties now remains unknown due to the elections in Japan. However, most likely, the change in the Japanese leader will not lead to a setback in relations. The development of ties with Seoul fits the main foreign policy priorities of the United States and Japan, which includes developing a response to the North Korean threat. Of course, if the post of Japanese Prime Minister is taken by a more conservative politician, relations between Tokyo and Seoul may be shaken. However, given the South Korean president's flexibility when it comes to Japan's past, the two sides are likely to find an option to further develop ties. Moreover, for Yun, the restoration of relations with Tokyo is almost the most important foreign policy achievement, which his administration will not simply abandon. #Republic of Korea #Japan@rybar with @awaken_dragonSupport us ReutersJapan PM Kishida seeks to solidify South Korea ties on farewell visitJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida arrived for a whirlwind visit to South Korea on Friday, seeking to seal a newfound partnership between the neighbors which will be tested by imminent changes of leaders in Tokyo and Washington.	https://t.me/rybar/63406	2024-09-10T09:39:57-07:00

According to the Israel Defense Forces, the car near the village of Bab Maraa in West Bekaa contained fighters from an elite Hezbollah unit. According to preliminary data, as a result of the attack, one person was killed and three were injured. The commander of the forces - Radwan - Muhammad Qassem Al-Shaa is considered dead. Israeli sources report that he was involved in terrorist attacks against Israel. According to the military, its elimination will significantly reduce Hezbollah's ability to conduct combat operations on the Lebanese-Israeli border. Earlier, one of the leaders of the Israeli opposition, Benny Gantz, said that it is time for Israel to shift attention from the Gaza Strip to southern Lebanon, since the lack of a ceasefire agreement and the return of the hostages makes war with Iran-backed Hezbollah inevitable.

The Americans act according to the manual, artificially escalating tension, and then, under the pretext of countering the next threat, they develop territories. In South Korea, in Japan, in the Philippines, everything followed the same scenario. And we are now seeing a similar situation in Australia, where the number of exercises is growing exponentially, and new military facilities are being built throughout the continent. The day before yesterday, for example, the Australians began a major exercise - Kakadu - in the waters of the Timor and Arafura seas near the Darwin naval base , and 28 countries participate in it, and in total about 3 thousand people, 15 ships and 30 airplanes and helicopters are involved. The main emphasis is on establishing interaction between sailors of different countries in the event of a crisis situation in the region. Participants will conduct firing training, patrolling as part of a group of ships and boats, as well as joint reconnaissance of a given area.📌 As you already understand from the attention paid to the Green Continent, the importance of Australia will only grow. Its considerable distance from China makes the country extremely convenient for creating a logistics chain through Australia in the event of a conflict with China. At the same time, if we recall the same experience of the US allies in the region, then in the coming years various types of American missile systems will probably reach Australia . Of course, under the pretext of containing the Celestial Empire. High resolution mapEnglish version#Australia #China #USA@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63403	2024-09-10T07:21:35-07:00

It is not yet clear when such plans will be implemented - what is clear is that American equipment will arrive on Japanese territory as part of the exercises. These are the first such statements about the deployment of missiles in Japan made by leading US officials. Back in April, we assumed that Typhon would arrive in the region, but then the choice fell on the Philippines. Obviously, the United States now wants to test the missile launcher under different conditions. 🔻A couple of important points remain unclear, the details of which we will most likely find out after some time. Firstly, at least the approximate location of the missile system is unknown. If it is deployed on the territory of Okinawa, the missiles will be able to reach the eastern part of China and almost the entire territory of the DPRK. If placed further north, the radius may also include the territory of the Russian Far East. Secondly, will Typhon be removed from Philippine territory. Yes, the system is due to go home after the completion of the Salaknib exercise evaluation in September. However, back in the summer, the Philippine authorities gave themselves some room to maneuver, mentioning that Typhon could remain in the future if necessary. Moreover, recently there have been some hints that the withdrawal of the missile system will depend on China’s behavior in the South China Sea. Given the situation in the region, the scenario of further deployment of Typhon in the Philippines is very likely. And then the PRC will be surrounded on both sides, which could lead to even greater tension in the Asia-Pacific region.#USA #Japan@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usTelegramRybar🇺🇸🇯🇵🇵🇭🇨🇳 This year, the situation in the Asia-Pacific region risks becoming even more tense - the United States plans to deploy missile systems in the region that are capable of launching medium-range Tomahawk missiles, as well as SM-6 missiles.

According to him, many food companies are interested in doing business on the Dark Continent. At the same time, it was rightly noted that -it’s difficult to make calculations there,- but the contours of cooperation are clearly visible. Against the backdrop of news about the initiatives of the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Ministry of Economic Development in Africa, this sounds like a statement of fact, but it’s still gratifying to see that a coordinated position on this issue between different actors. What is worth paying attention to in the context of settlements with the Sahel countries is Russian assistance in the transition from the CFA franc (which is issued in France) to other money or alternative instruments for settlements. The Ministry of Digital Development could very well get involved in this. In addition, it is quite possible to reach an agreement on transactions in local currencies. This topic has been raised before, but has not received proper development.

The first stage of the dry port, which we wrote about earlier, began to function in the Vinnitsa city community. The operator of the project was the Vinnitsa Container Terminal enterprise, owned by the Kyiv group of companies Lemtrans. During the work, railway tracks were laid, a container site with a capacity of up to 2 thousand TEU was equipped and a covered warehouse with an area of ​​3.5 thousand m² was erected. The total area of ​​the terminal is 8 hectares, and its throughput capacity is 30 thousand TEU per year. It is significant that a permanent logistics channel has already been established through the terminal with the company 🇵🇱 UZ CARGO POLAND to the port of Gdansk, which is actively used for the delivery of military cargo to Ukraine. The first batch of cargo processed amounted to more than 60 TEU.

However, it is significant that the visit of a high-ranking American intelligence officer occurred after Vladimir Putin’s big visit to Baku. ▪️Moreover, a year ago, Azerbaijani-American relations were reduced to a minimum level, but now the situation is clearly changing, and many major players are openly recognizing the key role of Azerbaijan in the South Caucasus. 🔻Such a visit should be considered primarily in the context of the situation in Armenia and the Armenian-Azerbaijani settlement. On the one hand, the Americans now continue to take direct control of Armenian state structures, and in Yerevan they are demonstrably throwing themselves into the arms of Washington, confirming their anti-Russian turn. On the other hand, Pryor’s arrival clearly demonstrates that the United States is not going to be guided by mythical alliances with Armenia, preferring to build the same relations with Azerbaijan, including in the military sphere.❗️Such visits of American intelligence officers to Baku are another signal for Russia. American politicians have already called on Azerbaijan to abandon close cooperation with the Russian Federation.

Yesterday, Vice-President of the European Commission Margaritis Schinas arrived in Yerevan, where he held meetings with Prime Minister of Armenia Pashinyan, President Khachaturian and Foreign Minister Mirzoyan. The main issue that was discussed during the meetings was strengthening interaction between Armenia and the European Union, as well as the beginning of negotiations on liberalization of the visa regime for Armenians. What kind of liberalization this is and what it consists of, no one knows yet. For all the time that the Armenian authorities presented this as a victory, there was not a single sensible explanation why this was so important. Maybe now something will become clearer, but there is no point in hoping for this either, because the negotiations have only just begun and when they it will end (and whether it will end) is completely unclear. But in general, the tactics of the European Union remain the same.

Once again, representatives of the West complained about the existence of a threat to the world order unseen since the Cold War, and also warned about an -unprecedented range of threats- emanating from Russia and China.🔻Main points: The situation around Russia and China▪️The offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kursk region raised questions among the Russian elite about what the armed conflict would lead to;▪️The Kursk offensive was a typically bold and bold move by the Ukrainians to try to change the rules of the game;▪️There are no signs that Putin's power has weakened.▪️It would be wrong to take the threats lightly Putin on nuclear escalation, but the West should not be overly intimidated; ▪️Despite the threats posed by Russia, the main intelligence and geopolitical problem of the 21st century is considered the growth of Chinese influence; ▪️CIA leadership has increased funding for the organization’s activities in the Chinese direction in three times, which is 20% of the agency's budget; Palestinian-Israeli conflict▪️London and Washington are working tirelessly to reach a ceasefire agreement;▪️The issue of releasing the hostages depends on whether the leaders of the warring parties are ready for difficult decisions and compromise;▪️Impossible assess how close the parties are to a peace agreement;▪️The two-state solution is fundamental to ensuring lasting peace;📌The big headline about the first joint conference in 77 years is not very important. In fact, negotiations between the American and British intelligence services at the highest level take place regularly. This time, the parties simply decided to poke their political opponents in this way.🔻If we put aside the obvious phrases and talk about the true meanings contained in the words of the leaders of Western intelligence services, then we should dwell on three points. Firstly, in fact the so-called Ukraine has not achieved the necessary success, but no one will admit this publicly. Secondly, the close interaction between China and Russia worries the West, so Washington and London want to increase pressure on Beijing, first of all, by depriving it of its role as the world’s factory, since there is more cheap labor in the world. Well, the current scenario for the development of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict suits everyone quite well (including the genocide of Palestinians). #Great Britain #USA @rybar Support us FtBill Burns and Richard Moore: Intelligence partnership helps the US and UK stay ahead in an uncertain worldTechnological advantage is key to ensuring the special relationship maintains its lead	https://t.me/rybar/63390	2024-09-10T01:19:50-07:00

Aliyev noted the growing role of the Southern Gas Corridor, which connects Azerbaijan with Italy through Turkey and Greece. ▪️For Italy, Azerbaijan has already become the main supplier of oil and the second exporter of gas. For Baku, Italians are one of the main trading partners: trade turnover between the countries reaches $16 billion. ▪️The Azerbaijani president, of course, mentioned peace negotiations with Armenia, which, according to him, are moving toward completion. ▪️On the sidelines of the forum, Aliyev also held a meeting with the Minister of Investment of Saudi Arabia, Khaled bin Abdulaziz al-Faleh. The parties discussed the activities of the Saudi company Acwa Power, which will soon commission the largest wind power plant on the Caspian coast. The project is also designed to export electricity to Europe. Aliyev’s trip to Italy once again demonstrates the importance for Europeans of diversifying energy supplies, in which Azerbaijan and transit Turkey play a prominent role. The EU is really interested in a speedy conclusion of peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and on terms the last one. Despite the periodic pro-Armenian declarations of some European political groups, they are limited only to statements and symbolic gestures. Practice shows that the European community benefits from peace in the South Caucasus even on Azerbaijani terms, since the stability of the region guarantees the stability of energy supplies. In this case, one can only remember with a smile how the Armenian government recently concluded an agreement on military cooperation with Italy, details which was deliberately not disclosed.

It turns out to be a kind of ideological trap: we say that there are no negotiations with terrorists, terrorists need to be eliminated... and at the same time we claim that we will raise the topic of negotiations after the expulsion of terrorists from the Kursk region. As if this is not the flesh and blood of the Kyiv regime, but some other forces that do not allow reaching consensus with the world community and the so-called Ukraine. Hence, there are quite obvious questions about the goal-setting and background of the SVO.

🇪🇬🇪🇹About the tension between Egypt and Ethiopia Latest news ...	🇪🇬🇪🇹About tensions between Egypt and Ethiopia The latest news from the Horn of Africa is disappointing: after the deployment of the Egyptian military contingent in Somalia, the almost forgotten Ethiopian-Egyptian confrontation has intensified.▪️In a recent speech, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed threatened the Somalis and Egyptians that if if they threaten Ethiopia, they will be destroyed militarily. On this occasion, the government organized demonstrations in major cities against the -external enemy-.▪️The cause of the conflict, of course, is the long-standing dispute over the Nile River dam and water shortages, in which always gave special priority to Egypt. But precisely the conditions that created the ground for shaking Egyptian positions in this area were formed only recently - with the accession of South Sudan to the Entebbe Agreements. It is obvious that although the political circles in Cairo do not like this, no one is going to enter into confrontation with Ethiopia, which, despite endless internal conflicts, remains a fully combat-ready country. At the same time, all the fuss raised by the Ethiopian authorities is directed not so much against Egypt, but with the goal of consolidating the population against a common enemy. The Prosperity Party has no idea which would unite the country, which resulted in conflict in Tigray, Oromia and Amhara. The army simply cannot cope with all the rebels demanding autonomy or independence, and the state faces a serious threat of split.🔻Here a simple solution to complex problems was found - to find an external enemy. Since Abiy Ahmed tries to maintain a multi-vector approach on the world stage, another regional player with whom relations were already tense was chosen as the enemy. But will this idea be able to unite the Ethiopians, given that the country is gradually disintegrating? Sounds extremely doubtful.#Africa #Egypt #Somalia #Ethiopia@rybarSupport usTelegram/CIG/ Telegram | Counter Intelligence Global🇪🇹❌🇸🇴🇪🇬 Ethiopian PM, Abiy Ahmed warns Somalia and Egypt that anyone who threatens Ethiopia will be militarily destroyed.The threat comes after news surfaced of Egyptian special forces being deployed to Somalia.🔗 Amhara News Service	https://t.me/rybar/63387	2024-09-09T23:04:02-07:00

Russian troops attacked with missiles the industrial zone of Pavlograd in the Dnepropetrovsk region and occupied Kramatorsk in the temporarily uncontrolled part of the DPR. In the Kursk region, Russian troops counterattacked in the Ulanka area, and also used UAB-20 guided bombs from a UAV - Outpost. In the Pokrovsky direction, fighting continues in the area of ​​Ukrainsk and Gornyak, as well as on the eastern outskirts of Selidovo. In the Donetsk direction, Russian troops completely liberated Krasnogorovka, gaining a foothold on the northwestern outskirts of the city. In the Yuzhnodonetsk direction, the Russian Armed Forces drove the enemy out of the territory of the Yuzhnodonbasskaya mine - No. 1 and liberated Vodyanoye, fighting is taking place in the industrial zone adjacent to the village.

This was the first time this drone was used in the Kursk region. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, it was recorded that the enemy was using drones spraying an incendiary mixture over forest plantations and Russian positions west of Ulanka. Thanks to these data, it was possible to establish that the Russian Armed Forces maintain control over the village of Ulanok, entrenched in one of the forest belts on the approaches to Fanaseevka.

Ukraine. Only now it is necessary to invite Russia to participate in a new summit. However, the Chancellor added that, in fact, no negotiations will change the fact that Berlin will continue to provide assistance to Kyiv. Scholz did not disclose any more details, but the Italian media to whom the information was leaked straight from his party, they lifted the curtain somewhat. According to them, the plan allows for the transfer of part of the Ukrainian territories to Russia and is a kind of analogue of the Minsk agreements, which ultimately turned out to be a deception and a distracting maneuver. It is obvious that the West will not conduct any negotiations beneficial for the Russian Federation, and conversations about them are rather aimed at strengthening internal pressure and an attempt to destabilize society with the thesis of Moscow’s -unwillingness to come to an agreement.- At the same time, it is clear that Scholz made a rather pathetic attempt to seize the initiative from the right-wing parties in Germany, which are in favor of ending the conflict. After all, for the ruling German coalition after the failed state elections, as well as the escalating wave of criticism from the Western allies, the situation as a whole looks extremely sad. However, it is clear that Scholz's attempts to play - the chancellor of the world - cause only disgust among both political figures and ordinary people. die Beendigung des militärischen Konflikts in der Ukraine zu sprechen - Bundeskanzler droht auch mit -Bestrafung aller, die an der Unterminierung des Nord Stream-Projekts beteiligt sind-Jetzt auf einmal?📌 Anmerkung:…	https://t.me/rybar/63381	2024-09-09T10:05:52-07:00

Member of Parliament from the Victory bloc Alexander Nesterovski noted that young people from different parts of the country took part in the march under the slogan -Moldova without the EU!- government. Remind you that on October 20, along with the presidential elections in Moldova, a referendum on the country’s European integration will be held. The latter is called the election strategy of President Maia Sandu, who is being re-elected for a second term. 🔻Representatives of the opposition accused the Central Election Commission of Moldova of preparing election fraud, as the body refused to consider a complaint from politicians about Sandu’s illegal use of administrative resources for the election campaign. Moreover, the Central Election Commission of Moldova controls the American USAID, and Washington literally allocates funds for Sandu’s campaign. Therefore, there is no doubt that without more active opposition from the opposition than now, the voting result Sandu needs will be completed virtually manually.#Moldova #USA@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63380	2024-09-09T09:46:27-07:00

It received the name Falcon Leap and is carried out every year over the territory of a European state. Nine NATO countries take part in it, a total of two thousand military personnel of airmobile units and ten transport aircraft, ranging from heavy A400s to light C-27s. It is essentially does not change from year to year. It takes place in two stages, the first of which involves the transfer of forces and assets to the territory of the Netherlands, and then the landing in training areas. As can be seen from the example of the activity of Alliance units, the exercises go one after another. This allows us to keep formations that are now practically not involved in active conflicts in good shape. For the most part, all these events are planned, and the schedule is publicly available. But with the beginning of the SVO, the approach to organizing training has undergone changes, primarily in the information space. Now what once had only a symbolic meaning is now presented in a completely different light. The conflict with Russia is presented as inevitable, artificially increasing tension in European countries.

An old Russian proverb can describe the change of the Ukrainian ambassador to Georgia. The most important thing here is not the words of the new head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of a quasi-state entity, but that he needs to show his activity. As part of a demonstration of usefulness, he called the ex-ambassador of the so-called Ukraine not understanding the realities of a warring state and replaced him with a new one (most likely, a convenient for himself a person). It is clear that for the upcoming elections in Georgia, pro-Western forces are mobilizing their resources for the victory of their puppets. New demonstrations are possible here, and even some provocations, which were mentioned in mid-May. But in the current realities, the position of the ruling party can be called stable thanks to a balanced policy that has led to the rise of the Georgian economy and the improvement of people's lives. Do you think Georgians will want to lose all this, while receiving awkward Western reforms and losing profits from interaction with Russia? Of course not.

The Avenger Triad event started today in the UK, Poland and Germany. It involves up to 4,000 people and about 200 pieces of military equipment, and it will last until September 19. Moreover, some of the tasks will be carried out by military personnel from permanent deployment points. The point is that this exercise should help not only in establishing interaction between different formations, but also in developing the concept of a multi-domain operation.❓Remember, we analyzed this using the example of Crimea? Waging war in cyberspace - one of the most important aspects of modern conflict. This, as well as the neglect of this issue, has been proven more than once using the example of the air defense system in the so-called Ukraine. And in this exercise, NATO troops will operate in conditions of -Russia’s use of chemical weapons.- That is, in addition to the standard deployment of troops to respond, various kinds of information and psychological operations will be practiced in the information space. This is despite the fact that in the special operation zone the enemy does not hesitate to use chemical weapons, and Russian troops are accused of this. Taking this into account, Avenger Triad can safely be called a test run of long-developed methods of propaganda.

At the moment, its further operation is impossible. The Ukrainian Armed Forces constantly strike at crossings in this area, trying to interfere with the work of the Russian Armed Forces and the evacuation of the population.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, Russian operational-tactical aviation carried out several strikes with guided air bombs on enemy positions in the area of ​​the Gordeevka international checkpoint and near Maryevka.

But in the original Shchetinin noted the intensification of NATO’s attempts to spread influence in our beloved region. Two big differences, as they say. The diplomat also said that: There are NATO programs that provide assistance in reforming security forces, training of specialized specialists, rearmament with an emphasis on the purchase of Western models, and joint military training activities - there is a clear desire The American military will try to influence the formation of the political and economic agenda of Latin American countries in relation to the states of the region. Here, however, I also have to find fault. It’s already thirty years too late to talk about the desire to try to influence the formation of the political and economic agenda of Latin American countries. The White House and the Pentagon have many developed tools and an established mechanism for cooperation with countries in the region - and this concept already requires fundamentally different work to counter or interact with partners when working in the region.

Reputable think-tank structures in the West have become involved in this issue. The American Stratfor states that missile supplies to Russia contradict election promises... 🇮🇷 Speaking of Masoud Pezeshkian: the other day he spoke in favor of moving the capital to the southern regions of Iran for economic and political reasons.🔻Sanctions have not gone away and supply problems due to this is there. Therefore, the decision looks very balanced due to the extremely difficult supply of the capital region, as well as several other reasons: ▪️The main route for delivering products to Iran passes through the Persian Gulf, that is, goods are mainly delivered from the south. The railway track in Iran is in poor condition, which makes transportation across the country difficult. Of course, there is the Caspian Sea and Russia, but even there the infrastructure does not allow for large-scale turnover.▪️The international transport corridor is still at the implementation stage, and one cannot count on it. In addition, it will also pass through the southern provinces, and Bandar Abbas will be a key element.▪️In addition, moving the capital to the south will attract investment in not very popular regions suffering from a lack of funding, such as Sistan and Baluchistan. The port of Chahbahar would be more attractive with the development of the necessary infrastructure, and there would be much less various protests and unrest if people had the opportunity to earn money.▪️Well, another obvious advantage of moving the capital from Tehran is a greater distance from a possible air attack. The same Israelis, in all their plans for Iran, note the fact that Tehran is in the destruction zone of Israeli weapons. And in the south there are many desert areas where you can hide both military and political targets. Of course, for Iranians, Tehran is a Persian pearl, which they revere and are proud of its presence. The transfer of the capital will probably meet with fierce resistance from many, but there are indeed advantages from this. With the correct implementation, the Iranians themselves will benefit from this.

However, the fact that the Joe Biden administration has so far been skeptical about cryptocurrency trading has the industry concerned about the future policies of Kamala Harris and makes it look in the direction of Donald Trump. For example, Andreessen Horowitz co-founder Marc Andreessen, whose venture capital firm is a major sponsor of cryptocurrencies, recently stated that Trump is the right choice for the future of the crypto business. In turn, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, co-founders of the digital assets company Gemini, said they would donate $1 million to Trump. ▪️Large pro-Democratic crypto entrepreneurs complain that their colleagues do not believe the words of Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer about his readiness to interact with the new industry and go towards her. What scares many is the fact that the Democratic Party includes such ardent opponents of crypto as the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission Gary Gensler and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who believe that cryptocurrency trading poses a danger to consumers and the financial system. 🔻From all of the above, the conclusion suggests itself that the Democrats, apparently, have already lost the fight for the crypto industry. Promises should have been made earlier, but now we just have to come to terms with the fact that most of this business will donate money to the Republicans&nbsp; and vote for Donald Trump. #USA@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport usPOLITICO'Everyone's mad': Inside&nbsp;crypto's civil war over the 2024 electionsCrypto industry players are at odds over how to influence races for the White House and Congress.	https://t.me/rybar/63371	2024-09-09T04:44:27-07:00

The latest attack was one of the largest in recent times: about 15 strikes were carried out across several provinces at once. The Syrian Ministry of Defense reported that the missile launches were carried out from the airspace over the northern part of Lebanon and from the Mediterranean Sea. And although some of the ammunition was destroyed by air defense systems, others managed to hit government targets. ▪️In the province of Hama, the target was the city of Masyaf and the Scientific Research Center located southwest. The facility is used to produce components for high-precision surface-to-surface missiles. Like other Syrian scientific institutes, the center's staff actively interacts with Lebanese Hezbollah and Iranian scientists. Masyaf and its surroundings have previously been subject to attacks by the Israelis: according to them, positions of pro-Iranian forces are located in this area, which is not without reason. In addition to the damaged research institute, strikes were also carried out on weapons depots in Wadi al-Ayoun and Salamiyah. According to preliminary information, at least 60 people became victims of Israeli strikes in the province of Hama, 16 of whom died.▪️A convoy of military equipment was attacked in Tartus. According to some reports, armed Shiite formations are stationed in this area, fighting on the side of the Syrian army. ▪️Messages about strikes on Damascus are also spreading on the Internet, but there is no confirmation of this. It is likely that the explosions were mistaken for the work of Syrian air defense crews. Earlier last summer, the IDF Air Force attacked the positions of the Syrian armed forces several times, including destroying air defense systems. At the moment, the Syrians are armed with short-range Pantsir-S1 air defense missile systems, which allows Israeli aircraft to carry out strikes deep in Syrian territory.

Reputable think-tank structures in the West have become involved in this issue. The American Stratfor states that missile supplies to Russia contradict the election promises of Masoud Pezeshkian about his intention to resume negotiations on the nuclear deal. According to analysts, this demonstrates the limited influence of the government of the new president on the foreign policy of the Islamic Republic .▪️Let us repeat once again: discussions about Iranian missiles have been going on for two years, and at the moment there is still no evidence of their presence in the Russian Armed Forces, unlike the same North Korean KN-23. The Iranian authorities logically deny everything. Even if they were handed over or will be handed over, they will not admit it. So it was with the Geraniums, so it was with the Mohajers, so it was with the rockets. True, now in the West they are hooked on the ambiguous words of a member of the National Security Commission, Akhmad Ardestani, who said: -Why can’t we send missiles to Russia, we and so under sanctions, how could it be even worse?-.▪️As ​​for the powers of the new president, has the level of think tanks in the West, which many previously looked up to, fallen so much that they are surprised by this in Iran? Any self-respecting expert on Iran knows that the president cannot do anything without the approval of several structures, and the last word always belongs to the supreme leader. For Iran, cooperation with Russia is strategically important, and even liberals will not completely abandon it. The same Ardestani said that the Iranians need agricultural crops from the Russian Federation, and sending weapons is one of the solutions to the problem. #Russia #Iran #Ukraine @rybarSupport usStratforIran: Tehran Sends Russia Ballistic Missiles for Use in Ukraine | RANEAfter months of EU and U.S. warnings, Iran sent Russia short-range ballistic missiles for use in the Ukraine war, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sept. 6, citing U.S. and European officials.	https://t.me/rybar/63369	2024-09-09T02:36:44-07:00

Two more planes arrived from the USA and one from Germany. ▪️It cost $656 million, with an average price of one aircraft of $50.5 million. At the same time, a record number of aircraft were also taken out of the Republic of Kazakhstan - 10, of which seven flew to Ireland.▪️Thanks to its geography, Kazakhstan after Russia banned flights airlines from unfriendly countries began to claim the title of logistics hub. The desire for this is shown by the numbers of flights served by Kazaeronavigation: more than 415 thousand flights, of which about 107 thousand were on Kazakh and 308 thousand on foreign airlines, which was a record for Kazakhstan. ▪️Astana is definitely striving to expand its flight geography. In addition to the fact that Air Astana and Japan Airlines have signed a codeshare agreement (agreement on joint operation of one route), according to which they will share a new flight from Almaty to Tokyo, the launch of the Astana - New York flight is planned for the end of 2025 . ▪️It is for this reason that specialists from the US Federal Civil Aviation Administration began checking the country’s readiness to open direct flights between Kazakhstan and the States, and Kazakhstan was the first Central Asian country to open a permanent representative office in the International Civil Aviation Association (ICAO).📌An interesting touch: until February 2024, 49% of Air Astana shares belonged to the British BAE Systems, and the chief executive officer of the carrier is a British citizen, Commander of the Order of the British Empire, Peter Foster. However, recently a scandal around the airline has been gaining momentum: more and more details of flight cancellations and scandals with passengers are appearing in the press, and even hail at the Astana airport manages to damage exclusively the planes of this carrier, photos of which are immediately leaked to bloggers. 🔻Added to this was the radical statement by the Chairman of the Civil Aviation Committee of Kazakhstan that Air Astana does not and did not have official status as a national carrier. At the same time, Air Astana has always positioned itself as a nationalist and even used this term in its marketing materials. ❗️While -purely British- and other Western airlines are refusing flights to China due to the need to fly over Russia and rising costs, London has resolved the logistics issue through a -partner-. But the statement of the KGA may indicate that the authorities of the Republic of Kazakhstan are planning to review aviation policy from the position of newly acquired strength. And create or declare 100% of the national carrier, while depriving the joint company with the UK of the opportunity to skim all the cream.#Kazakhstan #CentralAsia@rybar Support usKazakhstanskaya PravdaA record number of passenger aircraft was imported by Kazakhstan in six months.

As it turned out, as Prime Minister in 2022, he secretly met with representatives of the American uranium company Uranium Energy Corp. And this year, by a stroke of luck, Johnson has already become the director of her daughter Better Earth, registered in a British offshore. No less interesting is the fact that Boris hired his former 29-year-old government assistant, Charlotte Owen, as vice president of the company. By the way, at such a young age the girl also received a life peerage, being included in Johnson's list of honors upon retirement.

Lisbon promised to give them to the Kyiv regime in the fall of 2022, but actual delivery has only now come. All the aircraft have not actually been used since 2018 due to anti-Russian EU sanctions, which made service maintenance and the supply of spare parts difficult. If Ukrainian enterprises manage to return these Ka-32s to service, then they will be used either for transporting cargo or for special tasks. It is characteristic that, with a strong desire, the Portuguese could well sell the sides that have become a suitcase without a handle to other interested countries. However, the country's authorities chose once again to give to the Kyiv regime for free what they had once purchased for money.#Portugal #Russia #Ukraine @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63358	2024-09-08T12:01:49-07:00

In the central part of the enclave, the Israeli military began engineering work to strengthen positions in the Netzarim corridor under their control - the reason was the increasing frequency of Hamas attacks on the positions of the Israel Defense Forces. In the West Bank, there was a terrorist attack at the Allenby checkpoint: a truck driver shot three Israeli border crossing officers with a pistol in the transport unloading zone.

According to him, he encountered some of the moments shown there while still serving in the DPR militia, although in ordinary life it seemed something completely absurd. Well, after what he saw during the assault on Mariupol by Donetsk reservists, he changed his attitude towards the film even more. In this case, we do not undertake to evaluate either -Penal Battalion-, -Nor Burnt by the Sun-, or other paintings from a historical or artistic point of view. The point is only that sometimes things can happen that in everyday life look like something completely impossible - up to the survival of the driver and passengers of a UAZ from an explosion on the TM-62. Over time, films will begin to appear about current events, where some moments will also be criticized for exactly the same reasons. Although reality sometimes throws up stories that are cooler than other fiction.#culture #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramAndrey MedvedevBattles for historical truth in cinema - about the war - have always been loud and the main narrative in them clearly sounded like this: everyone who created the film is lying and wants to discredit our Soviet history.

Because of which some seriously believe that the Kyiv regime is running out of people, and in general it is on the verge of collapse. Yes, in comparison with 2022, the enemy’s situation with manpower is indeed much worse - losses, flight of the population and other public processes make recruitment difficult. But this does not mean that there is absolutely no one to mobilize: if on the so-called. In Ukraine, everything is really so bad with this, then why aren’t they calling up students there yet?❗️And you can also remember that on our side it’s not robots who are fighting, but living people. Which also need to be replenished, rotated, sent on vacation, not to mention the overdue public request for partial demobilization of those called up in 2022. And these issues now require solutions, especially against the backdrop of the offensive plans of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. In the pursuit of sweet news from the enemy’s camp, it is very important not to forget to look at your feet, so as not to find yourself involved in unpleasant sensations in the same Western media. I would like to believe that the sad precedents of two years ago should have taught someone something. #mediatechnology #Russia #Ukraine @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63352	2024-09-08T07:05:12-07:00

Several hundred inmates of the Makala prison tried to escape from prison, without even a bladed weapon. The riot began in the courtroom and the judges came under attack from the prisoners. After which the protesters managed to set fire to the courtroom and a warehouse-hangar not far from it, after which they went to the women's pavilion, where they raped hundreds of women. Then they locked themselves in pavilion 11, since at that time they were already surrounded by security forces. As a result of the riot, more than a hundred prisoners died and 59 were injured. The main cause of death was stampede, and only 24 people died due to police fire.❗️The fact that prisoners were ready to escape at any cost even without a clear plan or weapons speaks about the harsh conditions in prisons. Thus, the Makala colony was not modernized with colonial times, and houses approximately 14,400 people, nearly 10 times its designed capacity. In addition, the majority are kept there only awaiting their sentence. Such people have nothing to lose. Against the background of these events, it is worth paying attention to a similar situation among our allies. The prison in Niamey, the capital of Niger, houses four times as many people as estimated. And in such conditions, terrorist ideas also spread well, which has already resulted in the recent uprising. But it’s worth limiting yourself not only to Africa.

In the meantime, such news should be taken with a grain of salt. The reasons are the same - since 2022, there has been plenty of speculation about the imminent transfer of missiles from Iran to Russian troops, and each time the publications referred to the most reliable sources and almost indicated the specific nomenclature with date of dispatch. However, for two and a half years, these products have never been seen in the Northern Military District zone.📌 It is now also difficult to assess the possible impact of Iranian ballistic missiles on the course of hostilities in the event of delivery. If only for reasons that at the moment they are a pig in a poke, and the real technical characteristics - especially the circular probable deviation - are not known for certain. At the same time, the appearance of missiles from the Islamic Republic will strengthen the capabilities of the Russian Armed Forces to hit targets in enemy rear areas as minimum in terms of salvo power. It can also force the Ukrainian Armed Forces to spend more expensive missiles for the Patriot air defense system, the number of which they currently have is limited.#Russia #Iran #Ukraine @rybarSupport usAP NewsUS believes Iran has transferred short-range ballistic missiles to Russia, AP sources sayThe United States has informed allies that it believes Iran has transferred short-range ballistic missiles to Russia for its war in Ukraine.	https://t.me/rybar/63347	2024-09-08T04:09:06-07:00

The head of Turkish intelligence, Ibrahim Kalin, visited Libya on September 5, where he held meetings with the leaders of the Turkish-backed Government of National Unity (GNU). After the approval of the memorandum of understanding between Turkey and the GNU, the powers of the Turkish contingent in Libya were seriously expanded, so the head’s visit intelligence seems a logical consequence.📌 There are no details about what exactly was discussed during these meetings. It is extremely doubtful that the Turks will escalate in Libya, given their employment in Syria and Iraq. But it is worth understanding that the Turks are not sovereign in their actions, and in the past active phase of the fighting in Libya, Turkey was limited to financial and military assistance to the militants. So this option is still possible. At the same time, as we have already said, there are no prerequisites for a resumption of hostilities.

Nevertheless, it has not yet reached the point of mass clashes - as a rule, everything can end with mounted police and water cannons. 📌Although such protests have not been anything new since the beginning of the escalation, over the past week thousands of protests have been taking place literally every day. The reason for them was the discovery by the Israel Defense Forces of the bodies of six hostages in the south of the Gaza Strip during a rescue operation. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid immediately blamed the incident on the current government led by Benjamin Netanyahu. Also adding to the situation a certain degree was the reluctance of several families of the dead hostages to meet with the Prime Minister. #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63335	2024-09-07T13:08:29-07:00

Opponents of the ruling party, represented by Mamuka Khazaradze, presented an election program, declaring their intention to introduce visas for Russians, ban direct flights from Russia, and the purchase of real estate and broadcasting Russian channels and so on. We all understand that in many countries in the post-Soviet space, one of the most important ways to score political points is to criticize the Soviet past and cooperation with Russia. The method is quite understandable, Russia is not liked in Georgia for obvious reasons and There really are revanchist sentiments there. But at the same time, most Georgians are not ready to shoot themselves in the foot and stop interacting with the Russian Federation to please the West. The current government is not our friends, but they understand their benefit and benefits for the country. Trade with the Russian Federation, relocation of relocations, parallel imports - this is what seriously helped Georgia. That’s why the ruling party runs the country, and the spring protests led to nothing.#Georgia #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63333	2024-09-07T09:45:14-07:00

To the east of Korenevo itself, a local advance of the Russian Armed Forces is recorded. According to our data, counterattacks by Russian troops here began at the end of August, and, apparently, some time ago they allowed the enemy to be driven out of the forest belts in the area of ​​the gas station. To the east, in the Kremyanoye-Kalinovo area, judging by the footage of objective control by the RF Armed Forces, the enemy is gaining a foothold in forest belts to the southeast of populated areas, equipping both new fortifications and occupying old strongholds. At the same time, the enemy even brought up towed artillery. In the Sudzhansky district, south of Khitrovka, an airstrike of the Russian Aerospace Forces was carried out by an accumulation of enemy forces in a forest belt. The accumulation of personnel and armored vehicles in this place confirms that Pogrebkov is at least in the gray zone. Between Cherkasy Porechny and Russian Porechny, an attempt to attack Russian troops in the direction of Kositsa is recorded, but with an unobvious outcome. Footage of these events was published by the enemy, and therefore it is impossible to judge the success of the attack from them. In addition, a small group of Ukrainian Armed Forces infantry was hit by a UAV strike to the west of Spalny.

Main The purpose of the convention is to harmonize all processes of AI systems with -human rights, principles of democracy and the rule of law-. In particular, ensure transparency, control, equality, non-discrimination, protection of privacy and personal data, as well as guarantee responsibility and accountability for the negative impacts of AI. Notably, the last paragraph will allow citizens to file complaints with the competent authorities about violations of their rights in connection with the use AI technologies. ❗️That is, in fact, AI-based systems will be moderated as strictly as, say, Facebook - information inconvenient for Western governments will be deleted. The pretext can be the good old and long-tested violation of the rights of any minorities and indigenous peoples.

It seems that everything is fine: every day the Turks hit the positions of the Kurds (and really effectively - we saw it with our own eyes). But there is no practical benefit from this method of struggle in the future for at least one year. The Kurds showed a high degree of adaptation to the tactics of their enemy and to some extent adopted the experience of Hamas, namely, they decentralized the control system and protected themselves in the event of the death of one of the leadership. Yes, the murder of another PKK functionary is a loss. Yes, it seems that the Turks are pressing with all their might, but the activity of the Kurds does not subside. Otherwise, why would the Turks ask for help from the Iraqi government?

However, in fact, there are already plenty of examples. Just the other day we wrote about the visit of the American Ambassador Christina Quinn to maritime patrol training and the subsequent meeting with the Attorney General. If we recall the actions of the United States in the post-Soviet space after the collapse of the USSR, then everything immediately falls into place. Control over the media and security forces is the calling card of the White House. This is what they achieve in the first place. Purchases of various types of equipment, joint seminars and, most importantly, basic bribery of officials in power in the country of interest. So this process is being implemented in full swing. And when you see in the news that the Americans have allocated 10-20 million for the needs of Armenia, then immediately keep in mind that such tiny amounts within the state are insignificant, but for the needs of politicians and their personal pockets it’s just the thing. #Armenia #NATO # USA @rybarSupport usSputnik ArmeniaUSA -bribing- Armenian law enforcement agencies: Major General of Justice A former high-ranking employee of investigative structures is alarmed by the activity of Americans who have become frequent members of the country's law enforcement agencies.	https://t.me/rybar/63329	2024-09-07T06:29:11-07:00

Forwarded From Tribaltic Extinctions🇪🇪🇬🇧As for Estonia itself, there is an ambiguous attitude towards the idea of ​​​​accepting foreign conclusions. For example, the head of the Ministry of Justice believes that the idea is conditional - hurt - and will bring the country 25-30 million euros per year (they took as a basis prices in the Netherlands, where prisoners from Norway and Belgium are often sent). At the same time, no one will release foreigners from penitentiary institutions; they should be released only in the territory of the country of imprisonment. But the head of the Estonian Ministry of Internal Affairs sees such an initiative as a threat to national security and rightly notes that the incubator of international crime develops behind bars, and not outside prison -.Estonian prisoners will begin to communicate with -new people-, enter into unexpected agreements, acquire contacts and enrich the criminal world in every possible way. And this does not really affect Estonia’s international image. In short, it is clear that the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs is also the chairman of the local Social Democratic party, and he also closely followed the pogroms carried out in Britain. Let's see how this story ends, but - if anything - the British delegation has already inspected one of the local prisons and I was satisfied.TelegramRybar🇬🇧 On the British government's attempts to send prisoners to Estonia Recent anti-migrant protests have once again raised the issue of a significant shortage of prisons in the country.

In order to at least slightly reduce the burden on correctional institutions, the government had to decide on the early release of about 3,700 prisoners. However, such radical measures may not be enough. In this regard, the British government is considering the possibility of sending prisoners to Estonia on a paid basis. The Baltic states need additional sources of funding, and the country's prisons are only half full.📌In fact, the idea of ​​renting cells in Estonian correctional institutions is not innovative. Last year, former justice minister Alex Chalk even visited the Baltic country to inspect prisons. It is comical that then the initiative of the Conservative Party was criticized by Labor, and now they began to implement it. Almost immediately after coming to power, Labor was faced with the need to solve many accumulated problems, and sudden mass unrest only worsened the situation. In the context of the shortage of prisons in the country, the simplest way out of the current situation immediately comes to mind: maybe there is no need to imprison people for reposting?#Great Britain #Estonia@rybar Support usTelegramRybar🇬🇧On the British government's reaction to the riots At the end of July after the attack on 17 -year-old teenager with a knife on children in Southport, large-scale protests broke out in many cities in the UK, which escalated into riots and clashes with the police.…	https://t.me/rybar/63327	2024-09-07T04:25:13-07:00

According to him, the reason is that restrictions are killing the dollar and everything it represents. Let us repeat the obvious: taking the word of such loud and, in addition, non-specific statements is akin to jumping on a rake. They are aimed exclusively at the American audience within the framework of the election cycle, that is, these are not even promises, but an element of the show. In the context of the prospects for the lifting of sanctions, it is much better to cite the recent words of Vladimir Putin that under Trump they have only become stricter. And also remember that instead of the warming of relations that people in their offices were counting on in 2016-2017, exactly the opposite happened. ❗️The stupidest thing you can do is to seriously expect that after the election of a new US president, suddenly, out of the blue, they will decide to stop supporting the so-called. Ukraine. Especially after the injection of astronomical amounts by local standards into it and even the tacit approval of terrorist attacks by the GUR. In this paradigm, Washington will most likely increase the degree of escalation in order to inflict maximum damage on Russia. And within the framework of the war until the last Ukrainian, the United States will continue to pump up the Kiev regime with weapons, while at the same time squeezing out the so-called Ukraine has its last juices until its collapse.#Russia #USA #Ukraine @rybarSupport usThe New RepublicTrump Makes Shocking Promise After Ex-Adviser Charged in Russia SchemeOne of Donald Trump’s former campaign advisers was just charged over his work for Russian state media.

One of the hits was on the Safad school, where refugees were housed: five people were killed and several more were injured. The satellite towns of Gaza, Beit Lahia and Jabaliya, also came under Israeli fire. Residential buildings and infrastructure were damaged. The number of deaths exceeded ten people.▪️At the same time, shooting from Israeli armored vehicles was recorded near the Tell al-Hawa area. However, after a series of shelling, there was no offensive activity from IDF units.▪️In the central part of the enclave, the Israelis traditionally worked in settlements controlled by Hamas. Nuseirat was under the most concentrated fire, where hits were recorded in the northern and central parts of the city.▪️Meanwhile, Israeli units completed the operation south of Deir al-Balah. Against this background, the IDF press service routinely reported on the successful elimination of Palestinian militants and the destruction of underground infrastructure.▪️The Israeli operation in Khan Yunis, which lasted throughout August, also came to an end. During a month of fighting in this part of the enclave, six tunnels about six kilometers long were destroyed and over 250 militants were eliminated.▪️And in Rafah, soldiers of the 162nd Armored Division - HaPlada - discovered the bodies of six hostages in one of the city tunnels. All of them were kidnapped on October 7, 2023 and killed by Hamas militants when they received information about the advance of the IDF to their place of detention.▪️In parallel, the Israelis are carrying out engineering work to destroy the underground infrastructure in the territory of the Philadelphia Corridor.

🔁 #Review #Summary for September 7, 2024 ▪️ A month and one day ...	Forwarded From Two majors#Review #Summary for September 7, 2024▪️ A month and one day The Russian Army has been repelling the armed invasion of the regular Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kursk region. Initial assessments of the scale of the invasion by respected departments quickly turned out to be not fully objective; personnel decisions are being made, so far - not at the level that many expected against the backdrop of the unpreparedness of the second echelons of defense and in connection with the ongoing arrests of high-ranking - old - employees of the Ministry of Defense. For now, the showdown is going on in the administrative and economic sector. The enemy in the Kursk region is constrained in battle, but does not give up attempts to push through our defenses, pulling reserves into the region. In the Russian Army, the problem of coordinating disparate units and units, supplying the front directly with drones, communications, and modern technical surveillance equipment has not been fully overcome. However, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are suffering serious losses under the attacks of our missiles, aircraft and artillery, which permanently reduces the likelihood of further movement to Kursk and Rylsk. At the same time, river crossings in the Glushkovsky district are under attack, which, given the destruction of our bridges, complicates logistics. The enemy is gaining a foothold on the occupied lines and the liberation of the territories occupied by him is not expected in the short term. Heavy fighting is taking place.▪️ Despite the situation in the Kursk region, Kyiv was unable to fully implement the plan of pulling all units from the Pokrovsky and Yuzhnodonetsk directions. At the same time, he himself ended up at the bottom point of the wave-like graph of saturation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with people and equipment, which exposed its defensive formations near Pokrovsk. There are 5 km left to the city, but the Russian Army is pulling up the southern flank and twisting the front from the north towards Kurakhovo, forming a -bag-. In addition, in the Yuzhno-Donetsk direction, the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Ugledar are gradually being flanked. The rush of the Russian Armed Forces from Novomayorsky to Prechistovka was unexpected. Also significant was the entry of our units south of Chasov Yar to the line of the Seversky Donets - Donbass water canal through Kleshcheevka, for which fighting had been going on since last year.▪️ Our military is predicting new attacks by the Ukrainian Armed Forces on different sections of the front, despite the enemy’s operational crisis in the Donbass. Despite the approach developed by the military-political leadership in Moscow about the impossibility of any exchange of territories in the Kursk region, Kyiv does not abandon plans to conduct sabotage and army operations in a number of directions, which is expected against the backdrop of elections in the United States in the fall. The drawdown of Ukrainian Armed Forces reserves causes missile strikes comparable in significance to the destruction of hundreds of Ukrainian military personnel at a military university in Poltava, but the enemy has never taken into account the loss of personnel. ▪️ There is no question of stopping military-technical assistance to Kyiv by the West. Europe, under US pressure, is preparing to transfer dozens of Leopard tanks, air defense systems and other equipment. The trophies of our troops in the Kursk region show that the invasion group of the Ukrainian Armed Forces was largely supported by NATO, which once again indicates the direct involvement of the Alliance in the war with Russia. The shelling of Kursk, Belgorod, and the DPR with Western weapons and the promotion of information about permission to fire air-launched missiles into our territories to greater depths also demonstrate that the North Atlantic Alliance does not experience any discomfort about the escalation of the conflict, while continuing to conduct military exercises near our borders, preparing their countries to mobilize and rebuild military factories.▪️ There are no grounds for a quick end to the war. There are still many difficult days left before achieving the stated and periodically changing goals of the NDC, which range from complete denazification and demilitarization of all of Ukraine to the liberation of the territories of new regions from the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Meanwhile, the West is trying to destroy our military and economic potential against Ukraine and undermine the internal political situation, which could be an even more serious threat to Russia. And the liberation of the Kursk region is not expected in the coming week. The war will be long. Summary compiled by: Two majors	https://t.me/rybar/63321	2024-09-06T22:28:55-07:00

The enemy also suffers significant losses in MLRS, which become a target for -Iskander-.🔻In the Korenevsky district, UAV operators of the Russian Armed Forces destroy armored vehicles and enemy vehicles on roads in the area of ​​​​Snagosti and Komarovka.

The attack aircraft are fighting on the eastern outskirts of Ukrainsk and are advancing towards Gornyak, bypassing the organized defense centers of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. ▪️In the Novogrodovka area, Ukrainian formations are making attempts to return the southwestern outskirts of the city under their control, including using heavy armored vehicles. For counterattacks, units of the 57th brigade, partly consisting of former completed ones, are used. ▪️In Selidovo, the fighting moved into the positional phase, the Ukrainian Armed Forces managed to transfer a sufficient number of troops to the populated area to organize a sustainable defense. Russian units are fighting in the area of ​​Gogol and 8th September streets, while no significant changes in the battle line have been noted. A few days ago, information appeared in the chats of local residents about the advance of attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces towards the central city hospital. It is likely that Russian intelligence officers were actually able to get close to the territory of the medical facility, but then retreated. At the moment, the situation in this area of ​​the city remains hidden by the fog of war. ▪️Russian troops have managed to completely occupy Lesovka over the past few days. Information about the liberation of Dolinovka, where the Russian flag was hoisted, was also confirmed. Then, relying on the occupied positions, the Russian Armed Forces launched an attack on Ukrainsk, trying to bypass the enemy’s defensive lines from the south and cut off the remaining Ukrainian Armed Forces units in the city from supplies. Russian attack aircraft knocked the enemy out of Karl Marx Street and gained a foothold on it, creating a springboard for the further liberation of the village. ❗️Some sources report the beginning of the assault by Russian troops on Gornyak, the last settlement before Kurakhovka. However, it is not possible to confirm this information with objective monitoring footage, while the testimony of local residents is quite often confused and inaccurate. ▪️To the east, Russian troops launched a series of attacks in the direction of Zhelanny First from Galitsynivka along Ivan Sereda Street, but their results remain unknown. Later, footage of a Ukrainian landing on the southern outskirts of the village, where fighting continues, appeared on the Internet.▪️The long information lull that prevailed in the Krasnogorovsky area was finally broken. Footage has appeared on the Internet showing the Russian flag on the building of the House of Culture in the private sector on the north-western outskirts of the settlement - it was there that units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces held positions for a long time, but their position significantly worsened due to the successes of the Russian Armed Forces in neighboring areas. At the same time, it is also reported that the presence of the enemy remains in this area, which is blocked in individual buildings and basements. Now Russian troops are clearing out the private sector and eliminating pockets of resistance to the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Also, Ukrainian formations retain the ability to hold defenses in a complex of farms to the west of the private sector. It is quite possible to organize the supply of this defense center using the delivery of supplies by drones.▪️To the south there are battles in the Maksimilyanovka-Georgievka sector, where Ukrainian formations are attempting to dislodge Russian units from their occupied positions.

Russia Foundation (deemed undesirable, USRF) and Free Russia Foundation (deemed undesirable and extremist, FRF). Among the leaked documents are payroll records of organizations, information about correspondence and their participants, and other interesting data. At the same time, former employees of the organizations have already confirmed to journalists the authenticity of the documents. And they even pointed out that they had not been published anywhere before and, most likely, leaked from the cloud storage where they were stored for grant reports. 🔻From the documents it follows that employees of the funds rocked the situation in Russia with the help of a bot factory, for which a manual was specially written, developed as part of an anti-Russian campaign, which was supervised by foreign intelligence services. Among other things, it turned out that the employees of this elf factory posted calls for protests, condemned the authorities, and even pretended to be the wives of those mobilized. From the documents it turned out that ready-made messages were practically written for the elves, in which they only needed, for example, to substitute the name of the city or square where the demonstrations were planned. At the same time, the bots were asked to distribute messages with any complaints about the -local administration-; however, which one exactly was up to the employees to come up with. This is not surprising: after all, it was necessary to somehow work out the daily quota - 100 throws - in an eight-hour working day. 📌Neither the USRF nor the FRF really make any comments on this topic, but the FRF indicated that they are monitoring the illegal distribution of documents likely related to their activities. They associate the leak with a recent hacker attack by the Coldriver group. which is associated with Russian intelligence services. However, the participation of direct employees of the company cannot be ruled out, so we will not be surprised if the liberal crowd abroad organizes a witch hunt and quarrels again.

From the available reserves of the US Army, the following will be transferred: ▪️air-to-ship guided missiles with a semi-active radar head RIM-7;▪️missiles for MANPADS -Stinger -;▪️ammunition for HIMARS MLRS;▪️155 mm and 105 mm artillery shells;▪️tube guided missiles with optical tracking and wire guidance for the BGM-71 TOW heavy anti-tank missile system;▪️Javelin ATGM and AT-4 grenade launchers;▪️battles s Bradley infantry vehicles;▪️M113 armored personnel carriers;▪️wheeled armored vehicles with enhanced mine protection MRAP;▪️small arms ammunition and grenades;▪️patrol boats;▪️naval training equipment;▪️demolition equipment and ammunition;▪️spare parts and auxiliary equipment.So Thus, the next American package of military assistance to Ukraine is comparable to all previous tranches and is designed to meet the most urgent needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, including air defense, ammunition for MLRS and artillery, armored vehicles and anti-tank weapons. However, according to insiders, the United States is close to approve the transfer to Ukraine of long-range cruise missiles capable of hitting targets at a distance of up to 300 km. It is expected that the AGM-158 JASSM will be included in the so-called military assistance package.

The agreement was concluded between government forces and rebels from the M23 group, supported by the pro-Western Rwandan government. ❗️But not even a day had passed before M23 continued their offensive, occupying the territories bordering Uganda. Militants supported by the Rwandan authorities occupied the city of Buganza and several villages, including the Ishasha border crossing. Thus, army units were sandwiched between Ugandan territory and Lake Edward. Due to the lack of information about the capture of military personnel in this area, we can conclude that government troops are still fiercely resisting, being surrounded.🔻Actually, in reality, there was no truce, and the Americans once again, hiding behind noble goals of providing humanitarian assistance to the population, in fact, nothing prevented the advance of the militants. And while real actions, such as imposing sanctions directly on Rwandan companies extracting coltan from the occupied territories of the Democratic Republic of Congo, are not expected, this whole story with Western support for the Congolese authorities is just a fiction .High resolution mapEnglish version#Africa #DRC #Rwanda #USA@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63310	2024-09-06T07:36:11-07:00

This is an element of an absolutely conscious and verified media campaign with specific goals. To smooth out social contradictions, various tools of information warfare are used, including grotesque humor or bringing the situation to the point of absurdity. In such simple ways, even repression can be seen as the norm, gradually turning it into something ordinary in people’s minds.▪️An example of the first is a theatrical production in Kyiv, where grimacing actors cheerfully depict a scene of a person being kidnapped by TCC workers. Although hatred towards them is so-called. Ukraine has already reached the point of mass attacks on military registration and enlistment office employees, the audience laughs and claps their hands together - after all, this is the new normal.▪️ An example of the second is the propaganda of the Islamic State in 2014-2015, which turned brutal executions into performances with special effects and professional camera work. For followers, images of beheadings and burning people did not cause disgust, but only fueled interest, contributing to the influx of manpower into the Islamic State. Exactly the same methods are used here. Pretentious music, fashionably dressed operatives, first-person shooting should evoke the necessary associations among Ukrainian viewers and create the feeling that they are not detaining poor souls trying to escape from a semi-totalitarian quasi-formation, but real terrorists and enemies who are not pitied. And this not only reflects the essence of the Kyiv regime, but also shows the danger of uncontrolled spinning of the propaganda flywheel. In an effort to instill hatred in the authorities of the so-called. Ukraine has gone from stories about self-shelling of Donetsk and cannibalism in marketing to the dehumanization of its own citizens. #mediatechnology #Ukraine @rybarSupport usTelegramNorin This is something, of course, with the taste with which they film this, it’s just delicious for them.

Forwarded From ARCHANGEL OF SPECIAL FORCES Z🇷🇺🪖 By increasing the grouping of troops in the Kursk region, Russian troops deprived the enemy of the possibility of mass use of armored vehicles. During the first time the Ukrainian Armed Forces entered the Kursk region, the enemy was repulsed by the border service, conscripts and representatives of various units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs on the ground. These units do not include the massive use of UAVs for reconnaissance and strikes, and this has played into the hands of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in terms of the use of armored combat vehicles. Now a significant number of military personnel are working in the Kursk region, using various UAVs to destroy enemy equipment, guns and personnel. Such circumstances force the landowners to return to the tactics that exist on the eastern front. The equipment is used as infantry support, work most often from the PDO. The main infantry forces move not in armored vehicles, but in the most inconspicuous civilian models; movement occurs in small groups. All this not only complicates the advance of the enemy in the areas he has leveled, but also complicates the delivery of supplies to forward units and the evacuation of the wounded.

Situation as of 14:00 on September 6, 2024. In the Artemovsk direction, Russian troops continue to advance simultaneously on several sectors of the front. After the relative stabilization of the line of contact, the Russian Armed Forces significantly expanded the zone of control at both Chasov Yar and Kleshcheevka, which became possible, among other things, thanks to the transfer of Ukrainian units to the Kursk direction.▪️In the Bogdanovka area, Russian troops advanced several kilometers to the west and gained a foothold on the outskirts of Grigorovka. The capture of this settlement will contribute to a further offensive and alignment of the front line along the Seversky Donets - Donbass canal.▪️To the south, Russian troops have cleared the eastern part of Kalinovka (Kalinin), and also gained a foothold on its western outskirts, where fighting is currently taking place. About 70% of the settlement is under the control of the RF Armed Forces. There are fierce battles for the village, since if it is liberated by Russian troops, the path to Chasov Yar from the north will be open.▪️In Chasov Yar itself, there are battles in the Oktyabrsky microdistrict, where Russian troops have gained a foothold on the first streets in the private sector, and also recently took captured squad of enemy fighters.▪️To the southeast, assault detachments of the Russian Armed Forces significantly expanded the zone of control in the vicinity of Kleshcheevka. The strategically important height 215 also came under the control of Russian troops, the battles for which lasted for several months. The large stronghold and the adjacent forest plantations are under the stable control of Russian troops. ❗️Yesterday, objective evidence of the presence of the Russian Armed Forces appeared directly on the territory of the Seversky Donets - Donbass canal, almost three kilometers southwest of height 215, which would have been impossible without maintaining the elevation. So far, only a single soldier of the Russian troops has been captured by the enemy, but the very fact of advancement is an important prerequisite for the future alignment of the front line along the canal at the Kurdyumovka - Andreevka line.

They say the military testifies: an unknown object crossed the Polish border near the Ukrainian city of Chervonograd in the Lviv region and disappeared from radar screens, flying 25 km over Polish territory. The radars of at least three radar stations confirmed it. They searched for a day, searched for two, a week - they are already being told, well, stop wasting public money on useless searches, but no, the Polish generals are showing unprecedented determination, tenacity and resilience - we will continue the search. And then the military says: we are not sure that the unknown object even flew into Polish airspace. The same military men who said that 10 days ago it was the opposite.📌It would seem like an anecdote, but no: a sad reality that says a lot not only about the Polish radar system, but also about the specialists who work with these devices, and the military who with enviable stubbornness they are looking for a non-existent needle in a haystack. #Poland #army@pl_syrenka - Poland is not a foreign country	https://t.me/rybar/63302	2024-09-06T01:54:16-07:00

Representatives of film organizations of Turkic countries signed a memorandum on the creation of a unified film and media platform during the TURKSOY forum in Samarkand. On this platform, content consumers will have access to film and media products produced by countries participating in the international organization of Turkic culture - Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Turkey and Uzbekistan.❓What does Netflix have to do with leaving Russia? Namely, a well-known service began its journey with a single platform, the business model of which is now considered exemplary. Having started by providing access to thousands of TV series, the company later began releasing its own content almost in an assembly line mode. Meanwhile, the phenomenon of Turkish TV series has already become one of the most striking examples of soft power and cultural diplomacy. Just look at the Magnificent Century, which tells the story of Suleiman I the Magnificent, under whom the Ottoman Empire reached the pinnacle of its power. The series found special love among Turkic and Muslim audiences, reminding them of former greatness (even if historically they had nothing to do with it). ❗️The attractive image of Turkey and its historical heritage created in this way is also projected onto future geopolitical projects. 🔻The accumulated colossal experience and influence of Turkish cinema should not be underestimated. Today, TV series produced in Turkey are broadcast in more than 170 countries around the world, reaching an audience of about 750 million people. These include Russians, who are massively hooked on them. It is clear from this that the creation of a platform with such support, and which in the future will massively release -brotherly-pan-Turkic content, will in the future become a serious trump card for this ideology. #Uzbekistan #Turkey #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usfergana.newsTURKSOY countries agreed to create a unified film and media platform	https://t.me/rybar/63301	2024-09-06T00:33:04-07:00

We are talking about 8.54 trillion. yen, which is approximately $59 billion. ▪️The request will be sent to the Ministry of Finance for consideration, after which a decision will be made on its approval at the end of December. Next year's budget will almost certainly be the largest in history - Japan will break its own records for the 11th time in a row. ▪️The funds will go to all the same areas that Tokyo has been focusing its attention on lately. These include, for example, the development of air defense and missile defense, unmanned aerial vehicles, and long-range missiles. ▪️Despite the development of high military technologies, one of the main problems of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces remains saturation with personnel. We previously wrote that the country once again did not recruit the required number of people to serve in the army. By the way, in February 2023, a commission to solve this problem stated that the authorities need to focus on increasing the salaries of military personnel and improving their living conditions and labor. However, spending on personnel continues to decline - in the budget for this year they account for 29%, and in spending for the next only 27%. 🔻Obviously, in Japanese military circles they are betting on the development of high technologies and asymmetric means of defense of the country. Given the changing security situation in the Asia-Pacific region, time will tell whether this approach will be justified. #Japan@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usNaval NewsJapan requests largest-ever defense budget for fiscal year 2025The Japan MoD issued its largest ever defense budget request.

Russian troops launched a series of attacks on enemy targets in territory controlled by the Kyiv regime. Ukrainian formations attacked the Kursk, Bryansk and Belgorod regions with drones, and another UAV was shot down in the sky over the Gomel region in Belarus. In the Kursk region, Russian troops repelled enemy attacks on the approaches to Korenevo, as well as at Russky Porechny. In the Sumy region, a Czech modification of the BM-21 MLRS, which was shelling settlements in the Russian borderland, was destroyed by a direct hit. In the Slobozhansky direction there are battles in the Glubokoe area, where Ukrainian formations carried out an attack by a column of armored vehicles on the positions of the Russian Armed Forces in a forest. In the Pokrovsky direction, clashes continue in the eastern outskirts of Selidovo, and the Russian Armed Forces strike enemy targets in Pokrovsk itself.

One point can be highlighted here: in the video, Russian armored vehicles are walking one after another - in conditions of continuous minefields, it is otherwise difficult to move. However, the equipment successfully copes with the task and provides fire cover for the infantry with the subsequent capture of the village.📌 In other words, with proper planning of actions, the level of organization and interaction with the provision of reconnaissance and cover with electronic warfare means, even an offensive by a column does not lead to inevitable huge losses of vehicles. Which happened in other similar episodes, where the above did not happen.

In previous reviews, we analyzed possible scenarios of enemy attacks in the Zaporozhye and Kherson directions, and now we will focus on the border regions.🔻While Ukrainian formations are gaining a foothold and trying to occupy more territory in the Kursk region, the offensive in the Belgorod region cannot be ruled out. During August, the Armed Forces of Ukraine launched several major attacks, but in the near future the enemy may try to break through in the direction of Volokonovka or Valuyka. The likely plan of the enemy’s actions in these areas is a diversionary strike in order to force the Russian command to transfer part of its forces there from Volchansk and from the Kupyansky direction. At the same time, a successful advance towards Valuyki will open the way deeper into the LPR. 🔻The possibility of Ukrainian sabotage groups being sent into the Bryansk region should not be overlooked - the abundance of large forests significantly simplifies the possibility of infiltrating the region. At the same time, concentrations of enemy forces, including Ichkerian militants, are recorded in the border area of ​​the Chernigov region. However, the Ukrainian command may decide on a full-fledged invasion following the example of the offensive in the Kursk region, despite the suicidal nature of such intentions. Moreover, the offensive through the large reserve - Bryansk Forest - along the Desna actually leads to Bryansk itself, which the Ukrainian Armed Forces units can take advantage of.📌 Against the backdrop of the advance of Russian troops in the Pokrovsky, Donetsk and Yuzhnodonetsk directions, there is a risk of a repetition of the situation with the Kursk region - while the media field was rapidly pumped up with messages about the successes of the Russian Armed Forces and the powerlessness of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Ukrainian formations unexpectedly launched a full-scale invasion. Therefore, no matter how sweet the euphoria from the actions of units of the Russian Armed Forces during the offensive towards Pokrovsk and Kurakhovo, the Ukrainian formations cannot be discounted, especially when they themselves stir up similar soil in the media field. #Belgorod #Bryansk #video #Kursk #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63295	2024-09-05T10:51:58-07:00

At the Koktal training ground in Kazakhstan, from August 20 to 23, joint tactical and special exercises were held - Altyn Kyran - 2024 - (Golden Eagle - 2024), in which about 300 took part military personnel of both countries. The purpose of the exercise was to develop combat potential during reconnaissance operations. The Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Azerbaijan reports that during the exercise, the units, having traveled along a selected traverse of 25 km, discovered and raided the shelters of illegal armed groups hiding in the mountainous area. The tasks of ambushing convoys and destroying the manpower of illegal armed groups, as well as other tasks that suddenly arose, were also successfully completed.📌This is not the first exercise of Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. In July of this year, military personnel of both countries took part in the international operational-tactical command and staff exercise Birlestik-2024 (Alliance-2024) with the participation of Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan in the Mangistau region of Kazakhstan. We have already written that the Kazakh army after the events January 2022 is being actively updated, focusing on mobility. The Azerbaijani army has managed to gain unique experience through the use of drones and conducting combat operations with limited forces, in a hostile environment and difficult natural conditions. Modern war largely blurs the boundaries between a full-fledged war and a counter-terrorist operation, so Kazakhstan’s interest here is understandable. The question is against whom the acquired skills will be used. Well, another goal of the event, as well as the Birlestik-2024 exercises, which is not obvious at first glance, is the militarization of the Organization of Turkic States in the interests of Ankara, where they are actively lobbying for the promotion of their weapons and creation of a supranational military Alliance in the region.#Kazakhstan&nbsp; #Azerbaijan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇦🇿🇰🇿🇰🇬🇺🇿 About the exercise -Alliance-2024-Meanwhile, the day before yesterday, the multinational exercise -Birlestik-2024-, which can also be called -Alliance-, started in Kazakhstan.

Previously, domestic products were often under pressure from Western competitors, but with their departure, Russian companies received orders, which has a positive effect on industrial performance. Yes, it will not be possible to carry out complete import substitution - in today's world economic realities it is simply impractical. However, in the same aircraft and engine manufacturing, transport sector and other areas, Russia may well regain some of the previously lost positions or even take new ones. However, it is important not to forget that this can only be achieved through targeted work with comprehensive planning and implementation of various forms of state support. Nothing will appear by itself, and simply replacing Western products with Chinese ones will not add growth to our own industry. Well, in general, it is necessary to avoid perceiving the current economic situation in Russia as a given, and not the fruit of the colossal work of people to create the same schemes for circumventing sanctions or - shadow fleet-. At a minimum, this will allow us not to stand still and reject populist proposals.#Russia #USA #economy@rybarSupport usTelegramOlder than EddaLooking at Western sanctions against us, I actually want to wish them to last as long as possible.

A representative of the National Maritime Council recently said that since the signing of the document, the situation in the region has changed significantly, and it is time to update the agreement. The Secretary of Defense also calls for this, focusing on expanding the interpretation of the provisions on an attack on the Philippines, in the event of which the United States must stand up for the island state. 🔻The concerns of the Philippine authorities are understandable: vague language, such as the lack of a specific definition of an armed attack, allows for different interpretations of the treaty. In the current video, the document cannot fully restrain China's ambitions in the South China Sea. And although it is not clear whether the Americans will agree to a revision, certain trends are visible here. For example, the 2023 Indo-Pacific Command report interprets armed attack extremely broadly. The wording actually includes the use of water cannons - the Chinese’s favorite means of pushing the Filipinos out to sea. The issue of revision is directly related to the US-China confrontation, and if the stakes increase, significant amendments may be made to the agreement. However, judging by the rhetoric of the Americans and the Chinese, there is no talk of escalation yet: this may mean that revising the agreement will remain only a dream of the Philippine authorities for now. #China #USA #Philippines@rybar with @awaken_dragonSupport usPhilippine News AgencyReview of PH-US defense treaty amid 'new security challenges'MANILA – The National Maritime Council (NMC) believes it is about time the Philippines and the United States (US ) review their over seven-decades-old Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) to make it more responsive to the modern security landscape.

Forwarded From Two MajorsIn the interests of the West in Ukraine&nbsp; continue to develop the sphere of railway transportation on the section Chop - Uzhgorod&nbsp; (near the borders with 🇭🇺Hungary and 🇸🇰Slovakia) work began on preparing the ground for laying Eurogauge (1435 mm). By July 2025, 22 km of railway track will be built, reconstruction of artificial structures, facilities and utility networks, and a European signaling system will be carried out. The 🇪🇺EU Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) Fund paid 50% (15.7 million euros) of the cost of the entire project. Investments go towards development&nbsp; logistics hubs on routes with the EU. On the territory of the Vinnitsa urban community, construction is underway of a dry port - a railway terminal connecting the central regions of Ukraine with the ports of Odessa and through the container terminal - Mostyksky - (Lviv region, owned by the oligarch Akhmetov) with EU countries. At the first stage (autumn 2024), railway infrastructure and the first container site with a throughput capacity of about 30 thousand TEU per year will be built. Investments in the project amounted to $15 million. The logistics hub itself&nbsp; -Mostyksky - will be complemented by a new container platform with a transition gauge of 1520 mm - 1435 mm, as well as a portal container crane on rails RMG. Earlier, in June 2023, pumping stations were already installed at Mostyksky, allowing for the transshipment of large volumes of liquid cargo from cars to railway tanks and from railway tanks from 1520 mm tracks to tanks on 1435 mm tracks. European Bank for Reconstruction and Development&nbsp ; (EBRD) in August announced an international tender for the purchase of 10 battery-powered shunting locomotives for Ukrzaliznytsia (UZ). In June 2024, as part of the program to update the locomotive fleet, the EBRD announced a loan of 300 million euros to UZ for the purchase of electric freight locomotives. At the beginning of 2024, the World Bank allocated $190 million to UZ for the acquisition&nbsp; 80 electric freight locomotives. These purchases made it possible to identify Ukraine’s needs for dual-system electric locomotives (DC/AC), including 25 kV, with a maximum operating speed of up to 120 km/h. The lack of trained personnel is also an acute issue, especially against the backdrop of the fierce mobilization of the male population. In addition, the US Agency for International Development (USAID) provided 300 grain wagons to Ukrainian exporters. It is significant that Ukraine is actively using grain carriers and agricultural facilities&nbsp; for the transportation and storage of military equipment supplied by Western countries through grain export channels (-alternative grain corridor-, -solidarity routes-). USAID is also preparing a feasibility study for the construction of the Bereshty multimodal logistics complex in 🇲🇩Moldova, which is designed to move cargo to Ukraine.✨Western investments in railway infrastructure are colossal and are associated primarily with commercial interests in the export of Ukrainian agricultural products and other resources. At the same time, NATO countries plan to use these routes to transfer their military cargo, equipment and personnel to the Russian direction.-Drang nach&nbsp;Osten 2.0-Two majors	https://t.me/rybar/63288	2024-09-05T06:05:02-07:00

Ukraine. Fighters and air defense systems were used to destroy the targets. As a result, the drones were successfully shot down over the territory of the Gomel region. At the site of the fall of the debris, a fire broke out in one of the utility warehouses, but casualties and other destruction were avoided. Recently, this is not the first case of interception of a UAV over the Republic of Belarus - in early August, several Ukrainian vehicles were hit there, launched in the central regions of Russia, bypassing positional air defense areas of the Russian Armed Forces. As you can see, Ukrainian formations are increasingly using Belarusian airspace to organize raids on Russian territory. Which will ultimately raise the question of an appropriate reaction from the leadership and armed forces of the Republic of Belarus. #Belarus #Ukraine Support us	https://t.me/rybar/63287	2024-09-05T05:07:11-07:00
🇦🇿🗳 About the results of the parliamentary elections in Azerba...	🇦🇿🗳 About the results of the parliamentary elections in Azerbaijan While the Central Election Commission of Azerbaijan is counting the final results (it has a maximum of 20 days for this) and transfers them to the Constitutional Court for final verification and approval (for this it has a maximum of 10 more days), the main political results can be summed up voting took place on Sunday.▪️Firstly, a decrease in voter turnout in parliamentary elections is becoming a trend. At the same time, three-quarters of voters or more come to the presidential elections. In this way, it is emphasized that Azerbaijan is not an oil sultanate, but a democratic state, and, secondly, its place in relation to the President is clearly indicated to the legislative branch.▪️ Regarding the new composition of the parliament, one can clearly say - all the same in the arena - with the clarification that they have appeared some new figures, such as the famous Soviet actor and experienced Azerbaijani ambassador to Moscow Polad Bulbul oglu, who was elected from Karabakh. Saghiba Gafarova will most likely remain at the head of the parliament and continue her international activities, essentially being the second Minister of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan (a minister with a female face).▪️In the new parliament there will be 10 instead of 8 opposition parties, with most of them as and in 2020 it will be represented only by the party leader. That is, the formal opposition will be 13 instead of 10 deputies. The ruling party - New Azerbaijan - will have 68 seats instead of 70.▪️According to the Central Election Commission, about 50,000 people could vote in Karabakh (in February, just over 20,000). The basis of the electorate in Karabakh were specially brought there - refugees from the occupied territories - and - forced migrants -.▪️Predictably, the elections were not recognized by the opposition and were characterized by skepticism by the West. But both of them look somehow toothless. The opposition National Council of Azerbaijan, in particular, considers the elections illegitimate, since the authorities did not allow the PACE delegation to conduct an observation mission at the elections and banned 76 members of the assembly from entering Azerbaijan. And the OSCE/ODIHR notes in its preliminary statement that the elections took place in a restrictive political and legal environment that does not contribute to genuine pluralism, and led to a fight devoid of competition. At the same time, all international organizations friendly to Azerbaijan, such as the CIS, SCO, Organization Turkic states, the Non-Aligned Movement (which has been living on Azerbaijan's money in recent years), the Parliamentary Assembly of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation and other elections were recognized as almost flawless. 🔻To summarize, we can say that the Azerbaijani authorities successfully held the first parliamentary elections throughout the country, received deputies in the parliament who will now legally represent the interests not of refugees from Karabakh as before, but of the population of Karabakh (even if brought), that is a significant trump card in the negotiation process. #Azerbaijan #elections@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇦🇿🗳 Today, early elections to the National Assembly are being held in Azerbaijan.

The suppression of conservative values ​​in the EU or the USA leads to an increase in the number of people wishing to emigrate from there, which can and should be taken advantage of. The main problem now is the lack of a system for selecting and accepting valuable personnel. The same Western relocants are faced with bureaucracy, which is why many people lose the desire to go all the way. And all this against the backdrop of a flow of migrants from Central Asia who easily enter Russia and often bring with them families, radical ideology and Russophobia. There is some progress here - a simplified entry and residence regime for foreigners who do not share neoliberal values ​​recently came into force collective West.

The authorities or sectarians from the OCU do not care at all what political views the parishioners or clergy of the UOC have - the label of enemy will be hung simply on the basis of the Orthodox religion.

The Japanese authorities, as expected, protested to China, to which Beijing stated that they had followed a legal route for themselves.▪️Since November 2021, this is the fourth time that Chinese Navy ships have carried out such provocative maneuvers near the Japanese islands, which is very reminiscent of the actions of the American fleet in Taiwan Strait. Considering the role Japan currently plays in the confrontation between the United States and China, an increase in the PLA's activity in the island state looks quite expected. The Japanese participate in almost all exercises, which cannot but anger China. Even look at the plans of the Land of the Rising Sun - and everything becomes obvious. Starting from September 8, a joint exercise with France, Bruno-Takamori, will take place in the north of the country to practice interaction between the military personnel of the two countries.

Against this background, the Armed Forces of Ukraine began to more often transfer personnel and equipment to the borderlands of the Sumy region, which with enviable consistency become targets of Russian missile forces. In the front-line zone, UAV operators hit pickup trucks and other lightly armored enemy vehicles.🔻No significant changes in the combat situation have been recorded in the Glushkovsky district. Russian troops continue to use pontoon crossings to evacuate civilians and supply the Russian Armed Forces group. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, attacks are being carried out on the equipment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is trying to break through to the approaches to Korenevo - the settlement itself is under the stable control of the Russian Armed Forces. Russian UAV operators hit all visible targets. Clashes continue in Olgovka, which changes hands. The enemy's attempts to gain a foothold in Komarovka were repelled.

🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦 About the details of the strike of the Russian Armed ...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 About the details of the strike of the Russian Armed Forces on Poltava from a Ukrainian medic New details of yesterday’s extremely effective strike on the communications training center in Poltava are slowly emerging on the Internet. One of the doctors of the volunteer battalion - Hospitallers - spoke about the first minutes after arrival, providing the story with details: ▪️Initially, the wounded were simply loaded in packs into an old ZIL truck literally on top of each other, which greatly reduced the likelihood of their survival. The narrator succinctly describes the picture of what was happening - - it was all about bodies, blood, screams, groans, pain and death -. ▪️ A considerable part of the wounded died due to low-quality Chinese medical products used in first aid (FP). Cheap turnstiles from the People's Republic of China tore when tightened, and only the members of the volunteer battalion had working products.▪️Another problem was the inability of the arriving doctors to provide first aid: the author gives an example of those who found themselves on the spot - confused young girls with long nails - who did not know that do. The State Emergency Service employees also only carried out the transfer of the wounded and were not even equipped with first aid kits. On the one hand, the words of the Hospitaller medic indirectly confirm that the scale of enemy losses is much higher than the official figures of the Kyiv regime. In this particular case, the information about the death of over 200 members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is really more like the truth, and not elephant radio. Also, the eyewitness account again illustrates that the situation with medical care is worse than is sometimes believed in the Russian blogosphere - there are very familiar people in the text moments about poor-quality turnstiles and inability to provide first aid.❗️It is important to emphasize: the latter is another reason to learn from other people’s mistakes. It is no secret that in domestic law enforcement agencies many people still (!) perceive the words -tourniquet-, -bandage- and -bandage-tamponade- as French curses, not to mention the MARCH protocols (or its analogue KULAK-BARIN). Therefore It will be better if some public figures, instead of hooting at the enemy’s problems, devote their publications with stories to the popularization of at least official manuals on tactical medicine. This will give a much greater practical effect.#Poltava #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63271	2024-09-04T09:23:50-07:00

The odious head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, Dmitry Kuleba, who has held the chair since 2020, also wrote a letter of resignation. The reshuffle is hardly a sign of any changes within the Kyiv regime. Moreover, the Ukrainian quasi-state entity is completely under external control, and replacing some talking heads with others will not fundamentally affect its functioning. But these resignations can simulate the struggle for social justice and sell it profitably to the internal audience, letting off a little steam from the growing contradictions in society. And also carefully remove the most toxic characters like Kuleba, who is remembered for his public insults against NATO countries and its leaders. In general, for the sponsors of the so-called.

In general, we very often observed this approach in the example of Palestinian resources. Who, long before the current escalation in the Gaza Strip, were very fond of passing off militants detained by the Israelis as teenagers, and now trumpeting the destruction of objects where in reality nothing was flown in. But it’s one thing to see such simple and cheap tricks from Hamas propagandists, and another thing from sort of like famous American and European publications. Which clearly illustrates the level of the latter, as well as the state of Western mass media in general.#mediatechnology #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramRegnum-Russia launched a missile attack on an educational institution and a hospital in Poltava, killing 41 people - - SkyNewsBritish journalists decided not to mention that -an educational institution is not a school or kindergarten, but the 179th educational and training center of the Armed Forces of Ukraine...	https://t.me/rybar/63268	2024-09-04T06:16:06-07:00

This became possible immediately after the capture of several large strongholds located along the highway, after which the Ukrainian Armed Forces were forced to roll back in the direction of Vodyanoy.▪️In the latter there are currently battles going on, as well as on the approaches to the industrial zone. In addition, a fire attack was carried out on observation posts and positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the territory of the Yuzhnodonbasskaya No. 3- and No. 1 mines, both from tanks and FPV drones. The Russian Armed Forces had previously landed on the territory of the latter, gaining a foothold in the area. Further development of success in this direction in the event of the liberation of Vodyanoy will allow Ugledar to be semi-encircled from the right flank, significantly complicating the position of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the city.▪️ At the same time, Russian fighters achieved success west of Ugledar at Prechistovo. Over the past few days, the RF Armed Forces have been actively launching missile and bomb attacks on the enemy's airborne assault forces in the area of ​​the village, and also using heavy flamethrower systems - Solntsepek -. In the first days of September, it became known that the advanced assault detachments had established themselves on the outskirts of the village, having advanced several times north kilometers. Today, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced complete control over Prechistovka; earlier, enemy resources wrote about the liberation of the settlement. At the moment, the front runs along the Kashgalach River. ▪️At the same time, the presence of the Armed Forces of Ukraine still remains on the approaches to Novomayorsky, located west of Prechistovka. To the east, there is an increase in the intensity of shelling of enemy positions in Ugledar. Some channels even managed to announce an attack by the Russian Armed Forces from Pavlovka in the direction of the city, which is still nothing more than rumors.🔻It is worth understanding that head-on attacks from Pavlovka are meaningless without a simultaneous attack from the west and east (this has been confirmed more than once by unsuccessful attacks on Ugledar last year). A change in the tactics of storming a fortified area allows us to hope that one of the most important enemy strongholds will soon be liberated.

The politician will outline plans for the development of the country's financial sector and how they will affect the lives of citizens. Of course, on the eve of such an important event we should expect increased activity by large British businesses. Energy companies have already taken action. Their representatives are trying to put pressure on the government before adopting a new budget. According to the authorities' decision, from November 1, the tax on excess profits from energy resources will increase from 35% to 38%. At the same time, companies operating in the North Sea pay 30% corporation tax, as well as an additional levy of 10%. Representatives of these companies said that the implementation of the British government's plan to increase the excess profits tax would lead to a loss of revenue of 12 billion pounds. sterling and will put about 35,000 jobs at risk due to their abandonment of some projects. Following this, the Norwegian oil and gas company Neo Energy suspended work on a large oil field in the North Sea, citing the prospect of higher taxes and stricter environmental regulations.🔻Despite pressure from British business, the government will have to make a difficult decision and increase taxes. It is necessary to close the hole in the budget, increase defense spending, and solve other accumulated problems. The only question is who exactly will have to tighten their belts. #Great Britain #energy@rybar with @oldGBR Support us https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/role/check-and-approve-government-spending-and- taxation/the-budget-and-parliament/The Budget and ParliamentThe Budget is presented to the House of Commons by the Chancellor of the Exchequer each year.

Therefore, even if the current loss does not seem too significant, it is important to remember: its monetization is still ahead. ▪️The interest of French companies in alternative suppliers like Mongolia, where Macron visited in May 2023, may also be a distraction: firstly, new large deposits have not yet been confirmed there. Secondly, Mongolia, as yesterday’s visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin clearly showed, is (for now) under the strong influence of Russia (and China). Also, if French companies work in the country, a problem may arise when transporting products.🔻And in this case, it is possible that if Russian companies do start working in Niger, this will be followed by the activation of anti-government groups supported by France. And they have already begun to operate in the uranium mining region. Therefore, it is definitely worth keeping in mind the possibility of such a turn of events and systematically increasing the contingent of the Afrika Corps of the Defense Ministry in Niger.#Africa #Niger #Russia #France #energy@rybarSupport usTelegramAfrica Intel🇫🇷🇳🇪 French nuclear giant slips into the red following Niger-French breakupFrench nuclear giant Orano ended the first half of the year with a loss of €133 million, weighed down by difficulties in its mining activities in Niger due to a -highly degraded-…	https://t.me/rybar/63265	2024-09-04T03:18:55-07:00

Despite this, in 2024, more than 700 schools in Mongolia continue to teach the Russian language, and among students there is a revival of interest in the language and history of Russia. At the same time, there remain problems of lack of qualified teachers, modern textbooks and teaching materials. Therefore, the primary tasks for Russian soft power are obviously to ensure the operation of the existing infrastructure with everything necessary and, at the same time, to create additional opportunities for humanitarian cooperation. 📌Vladimir Putin's visit to Ulaanbaatar (and the work that preceded it) provided a serious impetus for the emergence of such opportunities. ▪️In 2024, thanks to the efforts of the Ministry of Education of the Russian Federation and Glazov State Engineering and Pedagogical University named after. V.G. Korolenko (SIPU), a new Russian-Mongolian school was opened, where 127 first-graders are already studying according to Russian educational standards.▪️Soon it is planned to open a Center for Open Education in Russian in Mongolia, which will be implemented by SIPU and will disseminate Russian education and culture in country. And this is only part of the projects that will now receive increased attention.🔻The Rybar team, in turn, also took part in strengthening Russian-Mongolian ties and combating the rewriting of history, timing our first graphic novel about the Battle of the Khalkhin Gol River to coincide with anniversary of the victory of the Soviet-Mongolian troops over militaristic Japan. It is the history of Khalkhin Gol that has recently become a favorite topic of pro-Western media and NGOs for promoting anti-Russian narratives in the country. And even though the books distributed in several Mongolian schools and libraries are still only a drop in the bucket.

This is partly due to the beginning of the rainy season in the Sahel, on the other hand, to the strengthening of army positions in the area.▪️Air strikes were constantly carried out on settlements under the control of the RRF on the Sennar ledge. And government forces attacked them on the flanks.▪️Another attempt by the rebels to attack El Fasher failed. And their artillery strikes hit markets where civilians were killed.▪️In the rear of the Rapid Reaction Forces, tribal rebels became more active. So, on August 22, they attacked the city of Gubeish in Western Kordofan. During the day of fighting, more than 140 people died on both sides. In response, the rebels carried out punitive operations in the area. They burned cars, shot some men and seized livestock.▪️Interesting events are also taking place in the east of the country - the border town of Matema came under the control of the Ethiopian FANO rebels. Previously, Washington planned to use them against Burhan, and such a turn of events may yet reveal itself in the future. Against this background, the Americans are trying to attract the official authorities of Khartoum to participate in the peace conference in Geneva under the patronage of the Americans. Even the head of the RRF called on his fighters to respect humanitarian law ahead of the negotiations. On this occasion, the head of Egyptian intelligence, Abbas Kemal, who was educated in the United States, also came to Port Sudan. He also promoted the idea of ​​al-Burhan's participation in the Geneva conference, although to no avail. While the status quo in the combat situation is observed, and the Americans insist on negotiations, government forces continue to strengthen their potential, refusing to make a deal with the RRF, whose actions are aggravating internal crises in the country.High resolution mapEnglish version#Africa #Sudan@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63259	2024-09-04T01:50:31-07:00

The agreement was concluded in 1958 and has since been extended several times, most recently in 2014. The document defines the procedure for the exchange technologies and results of nuclear research. The signing of the agreement is primarily due to the fact that the United States and Great Britain are modernizing their strategic offensive forces. The process requires a lot of time and money. The British Ministry of Defense forecasts that the budget of the organization that oversees modernization will grow by 62% to about 100 billion pounds over the next decade. Along with this, according to the latest estimates from the US Congressional Budget Office, a similar program designed for approximately 30 years will cost taxpayers $75 billion. The extension of the agreement is further evidence that the US and UK, under the pretext of threats from Russia and China, and strategic deterrence will continue to carry out activities to absorb growing military budgets.

The main thing (GlavMedia)📚 On September 3, 1945, Victory Day over militaristic Japan was declared in the Soviet Union - the event that put an end to World War II - the bloodiest military campaign in human history. For many years, the post-war world order was determined within the framework of the Yalta-Potsdam system of international relations, and the historical facts recorded in the documents of the Nuremberg, Tokyo and Khabarovsk tribunals were considered indisputable. But a drop wears away a stone: sadly, myths about the Second World War today prevail in Western, Japanese, and, more recently, in Russian society. On the eve of the 79th anniversary of the Victory over Japan, a very useful monograph was published - The Main Directions of Falsification events of the Second World War by foreign politicians, historians, and the media. The authors focus public attention on the seven most destructive directions for falsifying the history of the war years for Russia: ▪️ the role of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in the world history of the twentieth century; ▪️ the ratio of losses of Soviet and German troops in the Great Patriotic War; ▪️ the significance of the landing in Normandy and the opening of a second front; ▪️the significance of Lend-Lease in the Victory of the Soviet people in the Great Patriotic War;▪️one-sided anti-Soviet interpretation of the Katyn tragedy;▪️hushing up the facts of Western countries’ connivance with the actions of Hitler’s Germany to exterminate the Jewish people;▪️attempts to reassess the role of Japan in World War II.

While the Central Asian countries are making logistics routes through Afghanistan to Pakistan, India is laying out its own route through Iran and Turkmenistan. The first 20 containers have already arrived in Uzbekistan, as reported by Turkmen railway workers. Moreover, this route only partially uses the infrastructure of the MTC -North-South-. The corridor from India to Central Asia also became one of the topics at the meeting of the foreign ministers of all five countries on August 28-29 in New Delhi - this is the first meeting in such a format. And in the fall, the second summit of the leaders of India and the states of Central Asia is expected to take place. New Delhi’s intentions are clear: it does not want to depend either on unstable Afghanistan or on its old geopolitical rival Islamabad, while at the same time getting the opportunity to cause trouble for Beijing. Iran finds itself at the crossroads of several trade routes at once, while Washington does not even impose sanctions against the port of Chabahar, where Indian cargo is delivered, not wanting to alienate New Delhi. 🔻For Russia, this is a case with a rather controversial effect, requiring careful analysis and skillful diplomacy. Because, on the one hand, it creates opportunities to counterbalance Chinese influence in the region, which is growing as the One Belt, One Road initiative is implemented. On the other hand, this corridor fulfills the task that was set in Washington a month ago - to make Central Asia less dependent on Russia and China by providing it with an alternative trade route.

According to official data alone, the enemy declared 51 dead and 271 injured. Ukrainian propaganda focuses on statements about -civilians- and a certain -neighboring hospital-. ❗️And judging by the map, there are no hospitals nearby, and the nearest multi-storey buildings are dormitories, they are also the barracks of the damaged educational institution, which back in 2014 became the point of deployment of one of the TrO brigades. At the same time, we note that taking into account the enemy’s tendency to underestimate own losses, the success of the strike may be much higher. And against the backdrop of reports about the destruction of Swedish instructors, events in Poltava may take a more interesting turn, since the Internet already has versions about additional training of Ukrainian specialists for the ASC 890 AWACS aircraft announced for delivery.🔻We hope that the fact of a strike on a large enemy concentration in the deep to the rear - this is not a one-time incident, but the first news of systematic work specifically on enemy personnel.

This (besides, of course, air defense) created good advertising for Turkish drones. And if in the so-called Ukraine UAVs from Turkey are no longer particularly effective, then in Iraq the Turks use them every day, testing various ammunition on them. Against an enemy with no air defense, relatively inexpensive drones such as Bayraktar or more technologically advanced Akıncı are a serious reinforcement. This has been proven more than once using the example of Africa.📌 So in Egypt they planned to purchase Turkish drones immediately after the restoration of relations between the countries. It is unclear what specific types we are talking about, but it seems that the batch will be large, which will also include missile weapons. Just a couple of months ago, with Akıncı, the Turks successfully tested a supersonic laser-guided ballistic missile. And the Turks’ assortment has seriously expanded compared to three years ago. So Egypt can be understood in this regard. Instead of purchasing expensive Reapers with missiles that were lined up for years to come, they chose a more practical option. So to speak, cheap and cheerful.#Egypt #Turkey@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇹🇷🏴 Turkey’s operation against Kurdish formations in Syria and Iraq is based on a similar principle.

Still... 🇹🇷🏴 Turkey’s operation against Kurdish forces in Syria and Iraq is based on a similar principle. The Turks physically cannot get rid of them, but at the same time, their presence is sometimes useful for the authorities in Ankara. A few days ago, the Turkish Minister of Internal Affairs reported on the destruction of a cache of Kurds in the province of Sirnak in southeastern Turkey near Iraq. That is, not where the operation is taking place, but in Turkey itself. This example shows how to treat the words of the Turks about the destruction of millions of Kurds during the operation, namely, look at everything with a fair amount of skepticism.🔻The Turks regularly hit to the Kurds in Iraq using drones and aircraft, some are even actually eliminated, but there is no effect on a global scale. The Kurds adapted, built fortifications in the mountains and decentralized the control system. With the death of some field commander, the group continues to function without problems, and the Turks cannot do anything. Falling drones from Kurdish MANPADS and the presence of DRGs in Turkey itself are proof of this. The only benefit of all this for Turkey is that sometimes they use the Kurdish factor to artificially escalate tension in the country and distract the population from the deterioration of living standards. #terrorism #Turkey@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63248	2024-09-03T11:40:27-07:00

Still, they oppose the Pakistani state, and even more so against Pakistan’s ties with the Celestial Empire, which the Baluchis blame for many of their troubles. The Baluchis periodically remind themselves of themselves by carrying out terrorist attacks on the positions of the security forces and army of Pakistan. And the government can’t do anything about this, since this requires huge resources. Moreover, for the Pakistani authorities, the presence of a destabilizing factor in the form of the Baluchis is a convenient way to distract the population from other problems, for example, economic ones or in case of the threat of mass protests, as in the past week.#Pakistan #terrorism@rybarSupport usThe Express TribuneThose who reject the state are terrorists; we will address them, says the Interior MinisterInterior Minister Mohsin Naqvi asserts those rejecting the state are terrorists; no Balochistan operation is underway.	https://t.me/rybar/63247	2024-09-03T09:52:49-07:00
🇲🇳🇷🇺 About Vladimir Putin’s visit to Mongolia On the evening ...	🇲🇳🇷🇺 About Vladimir Putin’s visit to Mongolia On the evening of September 2, Vladimir Putin arrived in Mongolia for a visit. The official purpose of the trip is to participate in commemorative events in honor of the victory on the Khalkhin Gol River. During the trip, the Mongolian and Russian sides also discussed issues of bilateral cooperation. Agreements were signed in the field of supply of petroleum products, aviation fuel and other documents. ▪️For many media and various types of observers, two issues overshadowed the other results of the negotiations - the Power of Siberia-2 gas pipeline and Ulaanbaatar’s failure to comply with the provisions of the Rome Statute and the requirements of the ICC. Hints of the promotion of the latter topic are visible in the accounts of diplomatic representatives of Western countries in Mongolia. And some media outlets with connections to USAID even explain in their videos why the Mongols would like, but cannot, arrest Vladimir Putin. Speaking about the Power of Siberia-2, it is worth remembering that in August, according to the Chinese press, Mongolia did not include the gas pipeline planned for construction in the national development plan until 2028. Many agree that this happened due to the lack of effective agreements between Russia and China - for example, the parties have not yet reached a consensus on gas prices. Since the project is of particular importance, the topic of the gas pipeline was discussed at Russian-Mongolian negotiations. This is confirmed not only by Vladimir Putin’s statements, but also by the Russian President’s interview with the Mongolian publication Onoodor - in which he mentioned the possibility of Mongolia using transit gas for its own purposes. 🔻For Mongolia, Russia is one of the important foreign policy priorities. This is evidenced not only by the statements of politicians, but also by the economic situation. Ulaanbaatar has been dependent on Russian fuel supplies for quite some time. Against this background, Mongolia is actively implementing the so-called third neighbor policy, that is, developing relations not only with traditional partners in the person of Russia and China, but also with other countries that do not border Mongolian territory. First of all, we are talking about the USA, South Korea, Japan and the EU. For the resources of Mongolia, of which there are really many in the country, a real struggle is unfolding on the part of the countries of the West and East Asia. This is also due to requests from Mongolian enterprises actively seeking inflows of foreign investment. Given the speed with which Western NGOs, politicians and businesses are spreading their influence in the country, plans to develop cooperation between Mongolia and Russia may soon be in jeopardy. And, perhaps, the visit of the head of the Russian state will give impetus to correcting the current situation. #Mongolia #Russia@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usPresident of RussiaDocuments signed following the negotiations between the presidents of Russia and Mongolia1.

💰🇺🇦🇦🇹🇺🇸 About the criminal schemes of the US Democratic Pa...	💰🇺🇦🇦🇹🇺🇸 About the criminal schemes of the US Democratic Party on the so-called. Ukraine Recently, further details emerged about participation in crimes in the so-called. Ukraine members of the US Democratic Party and in particular the current President of the country Joe Biden. From court proceedings in Vienna, documents have leaked onto the Internet indicating the involvement of American officials in establishing external control of Ukraine and developing schemes to seize resources. ▪️The reason for collecting this data was the trial at the US request for the extradition of Ukrainian businessman Dmitry Firtash from Austria. He was detained in Vienna on March 12, 2014, when the Americans demanded his deportation. However, several more hearings on this issue were held in Austria, the last of which took place on June 14, 2023 and did not end in Washington’s favor.▪️As ​​part of this investigation, more and more evidence is emerging that the United States participated in organizing a coup in the so-called. Ukraine in 2013, in order to change the government to loyal supporters. These people were subsequently supposed to cover up the corruption schemes of the Democrats, mainly those that passed through Biden. In addition, by transferring control of the so-called. With Ukraine in a completely manual mode, the Americans were able to persecute businessmen and politicians who, for one reason or another, refused to cooperate. One of them, allegedly, was Firtash.▪️At the moment, the Austrian court has found that Biden and Victoria Nuland brought Turchynov and Yatsenyuk to power in Ukraine in order to - realize US interests, even to the point of physically eliminating dissenters -. Biden also threatened to stop providing Kyiv with a billion-dollar subsidy for refusing to fire the country’s prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, who was disliked by the United States, who refused to initiate cases on the American order. This was the Firtash case.▪️Moreover, Nuland blackmailed Ukrainian politicians with their foreign assets, and demanded that the former head of the SBU - eliminate or limit Firtash's influence -. At the same time, Turchynov demanded that a case be fabricated against the businessman and that he be banned from entering the country.▪️However, after Firtash won the first extradition process and was planning to return to Ukraine, they tried to stop him - three criminal cases were announced and immediate arrest of the businessman in case of return to his homeland, while Kiev had no grounds for the arrest. It is unlikely that today there are any doubts that the United States, one way or another, has made significant efforts to create and aggravate the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, thereby organizing multiple and not always clever and complex schemes to manage both Ukraine and its resources. Another question is why the Austrians suddenly decided to reveal this scheme or why they were allowed to reveal it. Obviously, this is happening as part of a corporate showdown. In addition, this also applies to the increasing pressure on American Democrats and the direct campaign against them by Republicans, which is more relevant than ever on the eve of the elections. At the same time, this is also a blow to the apparent legitimacy of the Kyiv regime, the campaign to discredit them also continues. Probably, in the future we will see even more revelations about the participation in various criminal schemes of the most senior members of the Democratic Party and the Ukrainian government. True, in the fate of the so-called. This will not change anything for Ukraine.#Austria #USA #Ukraine @rybar Support usTelegram21st Century Wire (Official)Explosive new evidence points to yet more corruption orchestrated between Washington and Kiev...🟦 NEW: Austrian Court Case Reveals More Evidence of Biden, Democrat Corruption in Ukrainehttps://21stcenturywire.com/2024/08/31/austrian-court-case-reveals…	https://t.me/rybar/63245	2024-09-03T07:14:55-07:00

But this, in turn, is a special case of another extremely important issue - the current saturation of units with personnel. This topic has been discussed in the troops, to put it mildly, not for the first time. Without a sufficient number of people at the front, rotations are disrupted, not to mention the possibility of conducting offensive operations: there will simply be nothing to support the current pace of the offensive in the Donbass, and the front will freeze, as before the Kharkov offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in September 2022. 📌 There is another side to the issue - without a large influx of fresh forces, the long-discussed partial demobilization of those called up in 2022 cannot be carried out. And there is a demand for it in society: so far there are no mass pickets of relatives of the mobilized, but the likelihood of their appearance will increase over time. And the enemy will definitely want to use them. The only way to resolve the issue of both replenishing units on the front line with personnel and simultaneously carrying out partial mobilization without losing the combat effectiveness of the armed forces is to ensure the influx of people into the army in greater numbers than they leave for a combination of reasons. Implementation this can be done using different methods. But there is an important point: you need to proceed from the fact that if any of the indicated methods does not ensure the completion of the task, then you should not engage in half-measures and drawing numbers in reports, but move on to the next one.❗️Yes, there are basically no easy solutions here. But ignoring the situation will lead to the fact that the enemy, by expanding the conscription (the people in the so-called Ukraine are far from finished), will be able to create a strong numerical superiority over our formations. And then we will have to take the same emergency measures to recruit people, but already in a much more unfavorable situation. How this happens can be recalled from the sad events of the fall of 2022. Which could have been avoided without postponing the necessary measures.#WSRF #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63244	2024-09-03T06:43:48-07:00

In addition to standard shooting and testing of various scenarios for the involvement of units, the participating formations are marching from several cities in eastern Kazakhstan. Infantry, armored and artillery units as part of automobile columns and railway trains are being transferred to the exercise area, about which the residents of Kazakhstan were warned.❗️The Ministry of Defense of Kazakhstan even made a note that the main task is to check the speed of movement in task area. The importance of logistics in modern conflicts is one of the most important aspects that was learned thanks to the NWO and on which many countries, including Kazakhstan, are working at an accelerated pace. Of course, Kazakhstan is not the most ideal example, if you remember all the problems in the army and the attitude of the leadership towards its armed forces. For the command of the Armed Forces of Kazakhstan, this is simply the implementation of the combat training plan and nothing more.▪️NATO, for example, abruptly came to its senses and resumed the implementation of the RAIL Baltica project, which before the North Military District was, one might say, only on paper. Similar projects in the Alliance are being developed in Finland and Romania.▪️We are seeing similar preparations in the Asia-Pacific region, where the Americans are building new bases (jumping sites) in the Philippines and Australia as part of the confrontation with China. It would seem that the transfer of forces and funds? However, practice has repeatedly shown that without the necessary infrastructure and the establishment of clear interaction, problems arise time after time.

Greek F-16 fighters, supported by the E-3A AWACS aircraft and air defense formations deployed in Romania, repelled the penetration of enemy aircraft. Turkey, or rather F-16C fighters, acted as the enemy. D, which took off from Turkey, -penetrated- into Romanian airspace and flew back.📌 Of course, such maneuvers are just a convention. For NATO pilots, this is a good way to maintain tone in joint actions and nothing more. Especially for the Greeks and Turks, who are not particularly involved anywhere (the Turkish operation in Iraq does not count). At the same time, in the air during the training, the E-3A was functioning at full capacity, scanning the space around Crimea and on the peninsula itself. And at that moment F-16s were observed over the Odessa region, which clearly was not an accident. There have been no strikes on Crimea for a long time, when compared with the intensity of raids in previous months, so you need to be on alert. Moreover, with the advent of American fighters, which are assisted by NATO aviation, the range of weapons of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has expanded.

🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦 About the likely course of actions of the Armed Force...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 About the likely course of actions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Russian border region Against the backdrop of the enemy’s offensive in the Kursk region and its consolidation in the occupied territory, the possibility of new incursions into neighboring regions cannot be discounted.🔻In the Belgorod region, attempts by Ukrainian formations to cross the state border are recorded from time to time, however all of them turned out to be unsuccessful, even taking into account the involvement of relatively large forces. At first glance, the enemy is focused on ousting the RF Armed Forces from the sanitary zone in the Kharkov region. However, the front line in the sector has already frozen since the start of the operation of Russian troops, and the nature of the fighting has shifted to positional. The hottest spots remain Volchansk and Glubokoe, where the Ukrainian Armed Forces carry out attacks from time to time. At the same time, several attempted attacks were recorded in the area of ​​​​Kolotilovka, Nekhoteevka and Bezymeno in August alone. Almost always in the official media there were statements about the DRG, but in reality we are talking about attacks by entire companies with the support of armored vehicles. It can also be noted that the enemy is mainly active in the border area at the Sumy-Kharkov line, while from Volchansk to Budarok, and from Budarok to Kamenka only shelling is observed. Although this situation has persisted almost from the very beginning of the Northern Military District, this does not mean that the Ukrainian Armed Forces will not take active actions here in the future. Moreover, the nature of the terrain in the area is not too different from the site of the invasion in the Kursk region - Volokonovka or Valuiki could be a potential direction of attack. The Bryansk region cannot be written off as a possible enemy offensive either. There are significantly more forests here, which are convenient for penetration across the border, and in the border settlements of the Chernigov region there is the presence of formations of Ichkerian militants. In this area, the actions of classic DRGs are very likely, including with a large number of UAVs as weapons of destruction in the deep rear. If they have repeaters, they will be able to set up ambushes and even mine roads and bridges remotely. However, the possibility of a full-fledged operation to invade the Bryansk region should not be ruled out either. After all, this is not the first time for the enemy to carry out suicidal operations such as landings on the Kinburn Spit or creating a bridgehead in Krynki. ❗️However, the most dangerous phenomenon at the moment is the hating mood in society and in the media. The euphoria against the backdrop of the pace of advancement and liberation of the territory of the DPR should not blur our eyes - the enemy himself is not trying to leave the Kursk region. Stories about how everything is fine and wonderful with us, but with the so-called. Ukraine is about to completely run out of people by the end of the year and military production will come to a standstill due to energy shortages, fraught with disappointment. Moreover, as practice shows, the disappointment is very bloody.

A National Investment Fund is being created in Uzbekistan, which will receive a stake in 18 state-owned enterprises and banks and will place its shares in an IPO. A decree on this was signed by President Shavkat Mirziyoyev on August 27. The fund will be created in the form of a joint stock company (JSC), and its sole shareholder before the public offering of shares will be the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The fund will own a share of 25 to 40% in companies such as Uzbekhydroenergo, Uzbekistan Airports, Navoiyazot, -National Electric Networks of Uzbekistan-, -Uzsuvtaminot- and many others. By the end of 2026, it is planned to place the fund’s shares on the Tashkent and international stock exchanges, including London. ▪️The fact that the main buyers of the fund's shares will be from the West was clear back in January 2023, when long-time English friends from Singapore, represented by President Halima Yacoub and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, visited Tashkent. One of the topics for the meeting was the involvement of the Singaporean side in the privatization process. ▪️And in March 2023, representatives of the American investment fund Franklin Templeton came to Tashkent to discuss the introduction of new mechanisms for attracting foreign investment in state-owned companies. Essentially, the fund’s task was to prepare the ground for the activities of Western investors and resolve technical issues.🔻Tashkent is preparing for the UK and the USA access to systemically important enterprises on a turnkey basis, hoping to solve its financial problems and balance the influence of the main foreign investors in the economy of Uzbekistan represented by China, Russia and Turkey.

Recently appointed to the post of Minister of Defense of the Republic of Korea, but not yet taking office, Kim Yong Hyun said that nuclear weapons could be one of the options in response to the threat of the DPRK. The new Minister of Defense had previously held a similar opinion. In his 2020 lectures, he emphasized that South Korea has no future without nuclear weapons. It is noteworthy that the change of the Minister of Defense is connected not only with ongoing conflicts in the world and developing relations between the DPRK and the Russian Federation, but also with the upcoming presidential elections in the United States. 🔻Perhaps this is how the South Korean authorities plan to respond to the possible victory of Donald Trump. Some prominent analysts, for example, predict that his win will result in a deal between Washington and Pyongyang. In such realities, South Korea, in their opinion, cannot survive without a nuclear program. However, even with the arrival of Trump, it is unlikely that South Korea will develop nuclear weapons. Seoul has had the opportunity to do this for a long time.

At the same time, the Russian Armed Forces are searching for and destroying targets in the Kursk and Sumy regions. In the Glushkovsky district, Ukrainian formations did not conduct offensive actions. Russian troops provide stable supplies to the group in this area, using pontoon crossings on the Seim River for this purpose. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, the Armed Forces of Ukraine launched attacks in the direction of Komarovka and Korenevo, without achieving significant success. Russian artillery hit personnel concentration areas in Apanasovka, Snagosti and Vishnevka, probably with the aim of disrupting the preparation of new enemy attacks on this section of the front. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, Ukrainian formations, according to available data, were able to slightly expand the zone of control in the vicinity of Pogrebki and Malaya Loknya. Judging by the geography of Russian artillery strikes, the Russian Armed Forces had previously abandoned positions in villages to avoid the threat of encirclement by the enemy. ▪️However, it is premature to declare the establishment of stable control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine over these settlements - the situation in the area is hidden - by the fog of war -. At the same time, artillery and aviation of the Russian Armed Forces are actively working on enemy positions, hitting assault groups and armored vehicles. ▪️Northwest of Zaoleshenka, Russian UAV operators struck an unspecified type of radar, likely deployed to monitor Russian drones or artillery. As a result of a direct hit, the station was destroyed. ❗️The fact that Ukrainian formations are deploying a radar tracking system in the occupied areas indicates the plans of the Ukrainian Armed Forces command to gain a foothold in the Kursk region, continuing to allocate significant human and technical resources to the site. 🔻In the Sumy region, Russian troops hit several important enemy targets with missile strikes.

However, this does not mean that their representatives will single-handedly determine the political course in these lands. Neither the AfD nor the CDU received the number of seats in parliament required to form a government - 32 out of the required 45 and 42 out of 61, respectively. This means that they will have to start negotiations with other parties to create a coalition.▪️In Thuringia, the Sarah Wagenknecht Union (SWA) came in second place in terms of the number of votes, but so far none of its members have voiced a further plan of action. On the one hand, AfD and SSV could create an effective alliance, since they see eye to eye on the same migration policy. On the other hand, it is difficult to imagine that the German authorities will allow the emergence of such a political force in eastern Germany. Therefore, we will probably soon have to observe the second act of the performance. It is unlikely that opponents of the right will limit themselves to name-calling and comparisons with fascists: for example, trials may well begin against representatives of the AfD (which has already happened in the past).📌 The scale of the traffic light coalition will depend on how active the traffic light coalition is against the right. consequences - whether everything will be limited to squabbling at the top or will result in yet another mass protests. However, regardless of the outcome, the main result of the elections is obvious: German citizens are tired of the activities of the government, the negative results of which they feel personally. And if earlier a number of problems seemed like something that would never affect the average citizen personally, now these problems are in the face, for example, migrants with knives on the streets, require specific solutions.#Germany@rybarSupport usTelegramTwo majors🇩🇪In Germany, parties opposed to the ruling coalition gain a majority in the last elections.In the federal state of Thuringia -Alternative for Germany- (AfD) gets 32.8% , -Sarah Wagenknecht Union- (BSW) - 15.8%, -Left- - 13.1%, in the state of Saxony...	https://t.me/rybar/63228	2024-09-02T07:09:02-07:00

He is charged with a bribe of 20 million rubles for assistance in concluding contracts for the supply of equipment to the Northern Military District zone. New arrests within the Ministry of Defense at least indicate that no one is planning to curtail the activities that began after the arrival of Andrei Belousov. Contrary to previously expressed concerns, the process was not limited to high-profile arrests of several individuals and has been ongoing for almost the fifth month in a row.📌 In general, such proceedings not only have an impact on -cleaning the ranks-, but also largely satisfy the social demand for justice and the fight against corruption, in addition giving a certain public carte blanche to the new leadership of the Ministry of Defense.

And now a video has appeared on the Internet where drones of this type are used in the Northern Military District zone already as an ersatz flamethrower system. The device sprays an incendiary mixture over positions in a forest belt in order to deprive them of cover from foliage. The effectiveness of this particular attack may be questionable, but the product will clearly be improved, as will its ammunition. And in this way, somewhere it will be possible to burn out landings with these means instead of using more expensive systems. Against the backdrop of such leaps in the development of the industry, it will no longer be surprising if mobile electronic warfare stations based on hexacopters appear in the near future. Moreover, they are already starting to be installed on robotic platforms. #UAV #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63226	2024-09-02T05:13:57-07:00

The main point is to train units of the ground forces and security forces to prevent terrorism, search for and eliminate sabotage groups in a wooded area.🔻As we have said more than once: any teaching is a great way to hide other activities. In this case, we are talking about conducting enhanced reconnaissance of Russian troops on the Kola Peninsula.▪️Tracking the activity of strategic aviation in Olenye, the Northern Fleet and other formations is one of the main tasks that Finnish units now perform.▪️It was with Finland’s accession to the Alliance that the intensity increased reconnaissance flights in the Barents Sea, where the American RC-135 and U-2S, as well as the Norwegian P-8A, fly almost on a regular basis.▪️Moreover, in the last days of August, the high activity of the satellite constellation over the Kola Peninsula became noticeable - satellites were filmed the port and airfield of Severomorsk, warehouses in Shchukozero and, of course, Olenya.❗️If we recall the recent attempts to strike Olenya or the high activity of the DRG in the border Russian regions, the unusual exercise, together with the increased attention of the entire NATO to the peninsula, should not be ignored and, as at a minimum, you should be prepared for new blows.

Essentially, the Finns are introducing the experience of the Ukrainian Air Force, which over the past year has equipped improvised shelters for aircraft on several routes throughout the country. And at the same time, Finns are practicing landing on roads, American and German fighters practiced a scenario for joint air cover of Finland from air bases in Latvia and Poland.▪️Simultaneously with the Air Force exercise, the second stage of the Finnish ground forces exercise Keha started in the south of Suomi, during which the main maneuvers took place at the Santahamina training ground. A characteristic feature of this stage was the involvement of law enforcement units in training, including the police, border and search and rescue services to practice joint actions in crisis situations.🔻In these two examples, as well as those noted by Severyanochka, a serious increase in the number of armed forces training can be noted Finland together with NATO units. And they are working out not just one scenario, but different variations of conflicts, taking into account the experience of ongoing battles in the so-called. Ukraine.

And now, two months later, certain positive changes in this direction have begun, one of which is the upcoming meeting of the working group in Mali on cooperation with Russia. Negotiations will take place between Malian ministers on the one hand and representatives of the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation on the other. They will discuss resource extraction and geological exploration, as well as cooperation in the energy sector. It should be noted that the actions of economic departments are beginning to work synchronously with African partners. After Tanzania and Senegal, work now begins to attract Russian business with the most pro-Russian leadership of Mali, the need for which we wrote earlier.🔻At the same time, we have to admit that many companies do not want to work with African countries due to risks and unclear prospects ( even in stable Senegal, it is worth looking only at long-term benefits). It seems that in order to launch vigorous economic activity in Africa, a clear command from the leadership is needed from the top. Otherwise, major initiatives - such as the discussed construction of a KAMAZ plant in one of the countries of the continent - will not be able to be launched. #Africa #Mali #Russia@rybarSupport usTACCMali authorities announced the first meeting of the working group on cooperation with the Russian FederationThe meeting will take place in Bamako on October 14-18	https://t.me/rybar/63223	2024-09-02T02:55:08-07:00

The President of the Republic of Kazakhstan took into account the increase in global energy deficit, probably linking it with the fact that the forecast balance of the Republic for 2024-2030 includes a significant shortage of electrical power. By the way, it is planned to cover it by importing electricity from Russia. President Tokayev considered the year that the referendum on nuclear energy was on the agenda to be a sufficient period for citizens to make an informed decision and, supporting the proposal of the government of the Republic of Kazakhstan, appointed a national referendum on issue of nuclear power plant construction on October 6, 2024. In connection with such rapid developments - the rhetoric of the Kazakh authorities has changed several times this summer - it becomes clearer why Western NGOs have recently stopped resisting the topic of nuclear power plant construction in principle and have focused on attempts to -sink- the Rosatom project in particular. The decision on construction has already become consensual and all that remains is to interfere in the choice of contractor. #Kazakhstan #energy @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar☢️🇰🇿 How Western NGOs in Kazakhstan are looking for an alternative to Rosatom The rhetoric of the Kazakh authorities regarding the nuclear power plant has undergone dramatic changes.

First, in early August, a major exercise, Paladin Strike, was held together with NATO units deployed in Latvia as part of multinational battle groups. NATO troops practiced firing, joint maneuvers, and then, after the end of the active phase, began transferring various formations to the east, both by road and railway. Under the guise of one exercise, the Alliance also tested the rapid transfer of combat units to the Russian border through transport routes, which have been actively worked on over the last year.🔻What is the main meaning of the NAMEJS exercise, we think, is clear. Under the pretext of exercises, Latvia is strengthening its borders even more and preparing infrastructure in case of conflict. This is exactly what NATO is doing throughout Europe - the Finns, Romanians and Poles won’t let you lie. And at the end of September in Latvia, another major exercise is expected with the participation of more than a dozen countries of the Alliance - Silver Arrow, within the framework of which scenarios for the involvement of NATO battle groups in full-scale war involving armored vehicles, aircraft, missile systems and drones.

Ukraine. One of the hits was at the Kyiv hydroelectric power station - two of the five generator transformers were hit there.▪️In the Vinnitsa region, an electrical substation of the same name came under fire, where a 750/330 kV autotransformer was destroyed. This created problems for the entire energy system of the country, since it is this substation that connects the South Ukrainian, Khmelnytsky and Rivne nuclear power plants.▪️Not far from Zhitomir, two open autotransformers at a local substation were struck. Their destruction led to significant problems with power supply in the administrative center of the region.▪️In the Odessa region, the blow hit an open autotransformer at the Usatovo substation 330. There are also signs of a hit to the protective structure and a group of high-voltage switches of 330 kV was destroyed, another was damaged.▪️In its own way In turn, Ukrainian formations carried out several massive UAV launches in the rear regions of Russia. In the Rostov region, the Rosrezerv oil depot -Atlas- was attacked, resulting in a fire at the facility.▪️Another Rosrezerv enterprise was attacked in the Kirov region - there drones hit the Zenit plant. A fire also broke out on the territory of the facility, but it was managed to be extinguished promptly.▪️At the end of the week, the Ukrainian Armed Forces launched over 150 UAVs across 16 regions of the Russian Federation, most of which were intercepted by air defense systems. Nevertheless, enemy drones hit the territory of the Moscow Oil Refinery Plant, as well as the Kashirskaya and Konakovskaya State District Power Plants.▪️The tense situation remained in the Kursk region, where the Ukrainian Armed Forces continued to transfer reinforcements. In the Glushkovo region, the enemy attacked positions of the Russian Armed Forces and crossings, and also prepared for a possible attack. #video #digest #map #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/63217	2024-09-01T22:01:50-07:00

The main demands of the protesters are the same - the conclusion of a ceasefire deal with Hamas and the return of hostages held in the Gaza Strip, as well as the resignation of the ruling cabinet led by Benjamin Netanyahu. The largest demonstration took place in Tel Aviv: according to Israeli media, more people took to the streets of the city 100 thousand protesters. Several roads were closed, including the Ayalon highway. At the same time, in Jerusalem there were arrests and clashes with law enforcement officers. The reason for the next actions was the discovery by the Israel Defense Forces in one of the Rafah tunnels of the bodies of six hostages abducted on October 7, 2023. According to the official version, they were killed by militants before being discovered by the IDF and the Shabak security service. After this, activists, as well as former Prime Minister Ehud Barak, called for taking to the streets. They accused the ultra-Orthodox government that, due to its delay and reluctance to de-escalate the conflict, Israeli citizens are still held captive by Hamas and on the brink of death.#Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63213	2024-09-01T12:10:27-07:00

Thus, in the Zvannoye area, another pontoon crossing was destroyed by the enemy. 🔻In the Korenevsky district there are battles for Komarovka, on the eastern outskirts of which the enemy presence remained. Meanwhile, artillery and aviation strikes at Vyemka and Snagosti. Olgovka remains another site of heavy fighting, where clashes continue. Attacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine are also recorded from time to time in the direction of Kremyany, but so far no changes in control zones have been recorded. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, at the Kruglenkoye - Cellars - Orlovka line, fighting continues. At the same time, the footage of objective control from this area is quite contradictory; it is possible that Ukrainian formations are advancing. The situation is different east of Sudzha. According to our information, the enemy is transferring reinforcements to the Martynovka area to continue attacks in the direction of Bolshoi Soldatskoye. Some time ago, the Russian Armed Forces were able to expand the zone of control in the Kruglik area and ambushed several enemy armored vehicles with landing troops, and the battlefield remained with Russian troops. However, based on regular reports from the Russian Ministry of Defense about attacks on Cherkasy Porechny, and enemy attacks on this line further to the northeast, the settlements of Pravda, Ivashkovsky, Zazulevka and Kubatkin were previously occupied by the enemy. To the south, in the Plekhovo area, a rotation of enemy units and the pull-up of mortars is recorded. At the same time, fighting continues in the vicinity of the village of Borki, but without changes in the zones of control both within the borders of the village and in neighboring Spalnoye.

The corresponding memorandum between the companies was signed during the recent visit of the President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev to Tajikistan.📌With the uranium reserves of Tajikistan, everything is not so simple. Both regional and industry media have stated at different times that 14% of its world reserves are concentrated in the republic. Uranium was indeed mined in Soviet Tajikistan, but Tajikistan is not mentioned in the current data of the World Nuclear Association. Kazakhstan's reserves account for 13% of the world's reserves. Considering that with the renaissance of nuclear energy in the world, a new race for uranium has begun, it is likely that Kazatomprom wants to learn more about the current state of Tajik reserves. And, if possible, expand your raw material base. Meanwhile, in Kazakhstan itself, out of more than a dozen projects, only in two are the state a 100% owner. Among Western countries, foreign partners are represented by France, Canada, and Japan. ❗️With the hands of Kazatomprom, they will be able to conduct exploration of reserves in the Republic of Tatarstan and assess the prospects for their development. We hope that the domestic Rosatom will also not miss this opportunity.🔻There is one more point. Kazakhstan's uranium, which lies in sandy soils, is confidently and easily mined. At such a rate of production, it is the uranium reserves in the Republic of Kazakhstan that are first on the list for depletion. Probably, the desire to have a neighborly look into Tajikistan may also be connected with this fact. #Kazakhstan #Tajikistan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usASIA-PlusKazakhstan and Uzbekistan entered the top five world leaders in uranium productionThe World Nuclear Association published data on uranium production in the world in 2020.

Recently, US Ambassador Christina Quinn met with the Prosecutor General of Armenia Anna Vardapetyan to discuss reforms. The Americans are already allocating millions of dollars to the republic’s security sector. ▪️It is obvious that there is a conflict of interest here: a foreign state puts under control branches of government that should formally be independent. ▪️But Vardapetyan’s persona speaks volumes: she is literally an agent of Western influence, like many other officials from Nikol Pashinyan’s team who took their posts after the 2018 revolution.❗️It is enough that Vardapetyan has been a member of the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London since 2015 , known as Chatham House, which is recognized as an undesirable organization in the Russian Federation. ▪️The Institute is also busy developing a political strategy regarding Russia. Chatham House actively supports the Russian opposition and calls for a change of power in the Russian Federation. Among the areas of struggle against Russia, Chatham House insists on the need for comprehensive support for reforms in the post-Soviet space. 🔻Vardapetyan plays exactly this role in Armenia, being a politician absolutely controlled by the West. Under the guise of reforms, key areas of the state are being brought under the control of Western governments. 📌 Moreover, Vardapetyan did not hold high government positions before her appointment to the post of Prosecutor General. But she was Pashinyan’s assistant and played a big role in clearing out opposition figures who threatened the positions of the pro-Western prime minister. So there can be no real struggle for human rights and reform when a person is simply carrying out a political order. #Armenia #USA #Great Britain @pezdicide no chemicals - just facts	https://t.me/rybar/63206	2024-09-01T06:43:54-07:00

It is known that the Prime Minister of Moldova Dorin Recean is persuading the Orthodox clergy of Moldova to change the patriarchy. Sandu also has close ties with the Romanian Church. Last fall, the Metropolis of Bessarabia, which is subordinate to Bucharest, launched an attack on the Moldavian Metropolis of the Russian Orthodox Church. ▪️The Romanian government announced an annual allocation of 2 million euros for the activities of its metropolis in Moldova. After this, aggressive information attacks began on the Moldavian Metropolis of the Russian Orthodox Church, luring priests with entire parishes to the Romanian side. ▪️A year ago, a group of priests from Chisinau were offered to leave the patronage of the Russian Orthodox Church and come under the authority of the Romanian Patriarch. Then the Moldavian Metropolitan convened a meeting of rectors of churches and monasteries, at which the majority supported maintaining their status within the Russian Church, so as not to provoke a split in society. 🔻Apparently, provocations from the Bessarabian Metropolis have subsided just in anticipation of the presidential elections in Moldova, which will be held on October 20. Now they have decided to use the religious issue for the benefit of Sandu’s presidential campaign. However, Moldovan society once already believed her false promises not to limit the scope of the Russian language. ❗️Moreover, it was not for nothing that Shoimaru pointed out that a radical attack on the Moldavian Metropolis could begin in the fall, that is, when Sandu officially achieves a second term and will not be guided by public opinion. #Moldova #Russia #church @rybarSupport ustv8.md A deputy from PAS allowed the ban on the Moldavian Metropolis.

This is a bilateral event that is regularly held with the participation of US and Chilean military personnel. This year it is taking place at the Paso Almonte training ground in northern Chile and will last until September 5. The key innovation this time was the transfer of HIMARS multiple launch rocket systems from the United States, which had not previously been noted. The countries will conduct joint firing, including using HIMARS.🔻HIMARS after the start of the air defense system became, one might say, the highlight of almost every US Armed Forces exercise. In training with African, Asian and European countries, high-precision installations are playing an increasingly important role, and mainly as part of PR. And this is not surprising, considering how many problems MLRS cause in a special operation zone. Advertising HIMARS in real combat modified the standard method of securing Americans in a country through military cooperation, and in this case, demonstrating their capabilities.

According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, 158 drones were intercepted in 16 regions, as well as over Moscow.▪️The largest number of ammunition was destroyed over the Kursk region - their number was 46. The work of the air defense of the Russian Armed Forces was recorded throughout the night.▪️At least 34 Ukrainian drones were intercepted over the Bryansk region. According to Governor Alexander Bogomaz, civilian casualties and destruction of infrastructure were avoided.▪️14 drones were neutralized in the airspace of the Belgorod region. At the same time, in Belgorod and the Belgorod region, commercial properties, private houses and civilian vehicles suffered material damage. ▪️In the Moscow region and Moscow, a downed UAV fell on a technical building on the territory of the Moscow Oil Refinery in Kapotnya, leading to a fire: its area was about 40 square meters, it was extinguished. According to some reports, the Kashirskaya State District Power Plant was also attacked, but there is no confirmation of this. Also, according to preliminary information, the enemy tried to attack the Zhukovsky airport. Temporary restrictions to ensure flight safety were also introduced on the functioning of the Vnukovo and Domodedovo airports; their operation was restored from 09:05.▪️In the Tver region, after a drone hit, a fire started at the Konakovo State District Power Plant, which was soon localized and extinguished. According to Governor Igor Rudenya, there were no casualties, electricity and gas supply to the district is carried out as usual.▪️Air defense systems also worked in Yaroslavl, Voronezh, Ryazan, Kaluga, Tula, Tambov, Smolensk, Oryol and Ivanovo regions; no casualties were recorded. Only in the Tarru district in the Lipetsk region was a cell phone tower damaged.🔻The night attack of the Ukrainian Armed Forces became the most massive since the beginning of the Northern Military District. Once again, the main targets were the fuel and energy complex facilities, where the enemy specially developed approach routes from the least protected directions. But in this case, only a few UAVs reached the targets, while the rest were destroyed. However, in the foreseeable future, the rate of production of drones by the enemy will be even higher. And you need to be prepared for this - if today the wave of drones on the capital was almost completely destroyed, this does not mean that tomorrow it will be exactly the same.

This happened during the visit of the Vietnamese Minister of Defense to Manila on August 30. ▪️Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has already called the meeting a significant milestone in the history of relations between the two countries. However, it is not yet entirely clear what the parties agreed on - the parties will sign an agreement in the security sphere before the end of this year.▪️Taking into account the recent exercises of the coast guards of the Philippines and Vietnam, it can be assumed that the agreement will be aimed at increasing interaction in this area. ▪️Perhaps the agreements also concern bilateral training with the participation of the Philippine and Vietnamese navies. Still, we should not forget that China is the main maritime competitor of the countries in the South China Sea. 🔻However, you should not expect anything breakthrough from this agreement. Despite the current popular theses about the need to form a united front from all participants in the territorial dispute against China, their practical implementation will have to wait a very long time. Moreover, now only the Philippines has such a proactive position on the conflict. From Vietnam's point of view, the visit of the Minister of Defense once again emphasizes that Hanoi will not give up its territorial claims. It seems that no one there is planning to change the approach to countering the activity of the PRC - the creation of bulk territories on the quiet and the periodic expulsion of Chinese ships from their waters have so far yielded the desired result. #Vietnam #Philippines@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usNikkei AsiaPhilippines and Vietnam sign defense agreementLetter of intent marks strengthening of bilateral relations	https://t.me/rybar/63201	2024-09-01T02:09:14-07:00

Kazakhstan is preparing a corrective oil production plan for 2024 due to the need to fulfill obligations under the OPEC+ agreement, said the Minister of Energy of the Republic of Kazakhstan Almasadam Satkaliev. In fact, the minister admitted that Astana systematically fails to fulfill its obligations under the deal. The rubber has been hanging on since March of this year - even then Kazakhstan exceeded its obligations by 131 thousand barrels per day. In July the numbers were approximately the same. 📌Kazakhstan controls only part of the production, and therefore it can only reduce its share, which occurs by reducing supplies to refineries and exports. The decline in exports reduces revenues to the National Fund, which contradicts the statements of the government, which is increasingly using its funds. But Astana is also not ready to cut budget expenditures, since this could cause social discontent and disruptions in infrastructure maintenance. And maintaining excess production will contribute to a decline in oil prices, which will also lead to a decrease in income. 🔻The government has taken on obligations that it is unable to fulfill, driving itself into a trap in pursuit of the petrodollar and raking out the entire pot to the bottom. A successful exit from the vicious circle is not yet in sight, and something suggests that this will soon affect Kazakhstan’s relations with Arab countries. #Kazakhstan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usInterfaxKazakhstan will adjust the 2024 oil production plan within the framework of the OPEC+ agreement 2024 due to the need to fulfill obligations under the OPEC+ agreement, Energy Minister Almasadam Satkaliev told Interfax.	https://t.me/rybar/63200	2024-09-01T00:48:10-07:00

Forwarded From Severyanochka🇷🇺🇫🇮 Since the Fishermen are talking about a new phase of active military exercises around the world, I would add that a similar thing is observed in the good old north. In Finland, two flight tactical trainings were recently completed - Pristine Flank and Ilmataktiikka, which took place from August 26 to 28 and from August 26 to 30, respectively. About 1 thousand military personnel from three countries took part in it - Finland, the USA and Sweden. From the Finns there were training aircraft and 22 F/A-18s, and from the Americans and the Swedes - MC-130J and C-130H, which flew to Tikkakoski. The tasks, in principle, remained unchanged, air combat, cover for special aviation for the drop of troops, the involvement of aircraft controllers and so on. This is still not so important for ordinary readers. What is more important is the realization that Finland now is practically the same as the Baltic states after joining NATO. There will be a lot of provocative maneuvers, increased press attention and inflating the imaginary threat from Russia. But underneath all this there will be hidden something extremely important and interesting, such as the equipment of bases, training grounds, trenches, defensive structures and testing offensive tactics in the northern Russian regions. #VSRF #Russia #FinlandSeveryanochka	https://t.me/rybar/63199	2024-09-01T00:39:41-07:00

Back in June 2024, the board of the New Azerbaijan party recommended holding elections ahead of schedule in November, allegedly because of the UN climate conference (COP29). However, the real reasons for the rush are, of course, different. These elections, first of all, are designed to consolidate the status of Karabakh within Azerbaijan through the election of legal representatives in parliament from these territories and the population living on them. The formally declared reason related to COP29 is secondary. 🔻After the elections, we can expect Azerbaijan to increase pressure on Armenia in order to speed up the signing of a peace treaty and hold a constitutional referendum, formalizing Armenia’s renunciation of claims to Karabakh.

🔁 #Review #Summary for the morning of September 1, 2024 ▪️ The p...	Forwarded From Two Majors#Review #Report for the morning of September 1, 2024▪️ The past week began with a massive attack on enemy rear targets. Military and economic damage was caused to the enemy, but no explosions occurred at symbolic objects like the Verkhovna Rada, despite the expectations of the Western press after the start of the Kursk operation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. ▪️ The defensive operation of the Russian Armed Forces in the Kursk region continues for the fourth week. The drawn up reserves made it possible to pin down the enemy in battles; the Ukrainian Armed Forces are conducting constant attacks in several directions, trying to push through our battle formations. Due to the absence of a continuous front line, the enemy resorts to methods of maneuver warfare, trying to separate our forces. Against the backdrop of attacks on Lgov, the head of the city again called on those who left for the rear areas not to return until the situation stabilizes. ▪️ The enemy retains reserves for attacks on the Belgorod, Bryansk, Zaporozhye and Kherson regions. Kyiv believes that the goals of such actions are the seizure of important logistics and energy facilities for further exchange in negotiations, which are out of the question at the moment. ▪️ At the same time, the actions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kursk region and the aforementioned preservation of reserves in the planned offensive directions do not give Kyiv the opportunity to stabilize the front in the Pokrovsky direction. As a result of heavy fighting, the Russian Armed Forces significantly advanced or occupied important positions on a 60 km front from Grodovka to the approaches to the Ugledar defensive hub. Thus, in the south of the Pokrovsky direction, the enemy was forced to flee Karlovka, which he held for months, and was unable to organize defense in Galitsynovka. The pace of the offensive raises concerns among some Russian experts about the risks of stretching the logistics of the Russian Army.▪️ In the Toretsk (Dzerzhinsk) direction, our troops are also developing success in heavy intense battles: the battles are taking place on the outskirts of Toretsk itself. It should be noted that the Ukrainian Armed Forces have been building this defensive area since 2014.▪️ This week, the Russian Ministry of Defense also reported that Sinkovka and Stelmakhovka were liberated in the Kupyansk direction.▪️ The situation when in the Kursk direction the Ukrainian Armed Forces managed to achieve success at the initial stage against border guards and conscripts, and in other directions the enemy often simply runs, which may be due not only to the incorrect situation by the command of the group of forces -North, responsible for the Kharkov and Kursk directions, but also to the deployment of battle-hardened units and subunits in the directions that were successful for us. Thus, in the Kursk direction, the enemy was pinned down by battles and inflicting extremely sensitive damage on the front-line soldiers transferred from other sectors: 810 OGBRMP, 155 OGBRMP, 56 DShP, group -Aida- and other combat units of the Special Forces -Akhmat-, as well as other experienced units .▪️ The Ukrainian Armed Forces’ strikes on our energy facilities remain an important element of the situation. Despite the fact that the lion's share of enemy drones are destroyed in the air, the enemy effectively knocks out the oil refinery. Today’s attack on the Konakovo State District Power Plant also shows that Ukraine is solving the task assigned to it by the West of inflicting maximum economic and military damage on Russia. At the same time, outright bungling in organizing the fight against enemy UAVs is still present. ▪️ Forecasts for the development of the situation by our military indicate the continuation of the enemy’s plans to organize offensive actions in the above directions, as well as try to occupy the spits of the Kherson region at any cost, as was the case in Krynki. The latter is necessary for the Ukrainian Armed Forces to organize a sea corridor from the ports of Nikolaev. Nobody cares how many soldiers Kyiv will lose. The renewal of the enemy's manpower is solved through total mobilization and its training in Western countries. At the same time, the absence of consequences for Kyiv and NATO for -crossing red lines- entails an escalation of the conflict and an increase in the damage caused to Russia.

An additional catalyst is Ethiopia's recognition of the independence of the self-proclaimed state of Somaliland this year.▪️At the same time, the Ethiopian authorities also continue to look for allies on the African continent from among pro-Western countries. Morocco is one of these.▪️So in July the parties exchanged military delegations, and during one of the last ones in Morocco from August 25 to 29, an agreement on military cooperation was signed. So far, its terms remain unknown, but they have been preparing for its signing for quite a long time. ▪️ Against this background, it seems funny that the Ethiopian authorities condemned the deployment of the Egyptian contingent in Somalia. Allegedly, a large military contingent, designed to at least ensure the security of large cities from the threat of terrorists, will become a factor of destabilization. The separatist authorities in Somaliland made a similar statement. It is still unknown what the further steps of the West and regional players in the confrontation over the Horn of Africa will lead to. The situation at the moment is tense and more and more contradictions are accumulating between the parties. One way or another, intervention is the last thing they will do in Addis Ababa.

Judging by the video, Russian troops identified from the air about 20 vehicles standing behind each other and struck them with a combined attack. First, the Russian Armed Forces tested two ballistic missiles with a cassette and high-explosive fragmentation warhead with an air blast, and then added a salvo of MLRS.📌 In this case, we can note the complex nature of the fire defeat, where missiles were not spared on the target. This largely managed to compensate for the accuracy and density of coverage, destroying much more vehicles and manpower of the Armed Forces of Ukraine than in the case of a strike by one Iskander or Tornado-S. And this is an absolutely correct approach: the relatively higher consumption provided the enemy with greater losses, as is a criterion for the success of fire damage. And the Iskander missile costs less than the unprevented transfer of enemy reserves, which the infantry will have to knock out with heavy fighting.#Russia #Sumy #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramTurned to the Z war 🇷🇺💥 Detection and destruction of a huge column (about 20 units of equipment ) near the village of Verkhnyaya Syrovatka in the Sumy region.

🔁🖼 The main problem of modern American AUGs, in addition to the...	Forwarded From Cats and Kramnik's cat The main problem of modern American AUGs, in addition to the loss of a significant part of the capabilities that they possessed 40 years ago, is the loss of the ability of the US Navy and the defense industry as a whole to quickly adapt to the changed strategic situation, due to a reduction in the range of projects and an increase in their terms implementation. Moreover, the latter, in addition to the natural complication of technology as it develops, is also dictated by a host of reasons from the sphere of management, only indirectly related to technology as such. The company’s desire to cut the pie it’s got for a longer time, out of fear that there may not be a next one (or it will be smaller), the loss of a project management culture on the part of the customer, who has long lost the skill of working with really large and complex systems *, financial pressure from the state, which is trying to cut costs and unify the provision of existing forces, etc. On top of all this are the problems of industry as such. As a result, even if you realize the problem - the decline in the capabilities of the AUG in modern naval combat -** there is no opportunity to quickly solve it - you do not have the required number of projects of the required degree of maturity in development and there is nothing to quickly adapt. Now, strictly speaking, there is, in principle, nothing for an aircraft carrier except the F-35 and Hawkeye, and this situation cannot be corrected quickly. Surely they will try to do something based on drones, and over the next 10 years, carrier-based drones will grow in number and range, but it is still very far away and unclear from a complete replacement of the operational functions of the wing at the level at which they were provided under Reagan/Bush Jr. , is it possible in principle._____________________* We also have a similar problem with the customer’s poor understanding of the essence of the proposed projects and systems and the relationship between them, which industry and then combat units regularly struggle with. This is, in general, a common problem for a number of large armed forces, which sharply simplified their own structure and many processes after the end of the Cold War, and are now faced with the fact that the tasks being solved cannot be adequately solved in this simplified structure and this simplified set. A classic example of rapid and complete degradation of this kind, known both in quotes and in decisions by year, can be considered the example of Great Britain, which consistently buried its own armed forces, turning them into a free (for the USA) annex to the US Armed Forces. But American and British experience and problems in this case, we can study from their documents and decisions, but for now we will keep silent about domestic ones in order to avoid, we will try to learn from someone else’s. As for the armed forces of second-tier countries, even very large ones, then, of course, this problem also exists there, but many of them is simply not realized due to the lack of appropriate practice and experience in understanding it. They will have to fill their bumps along the way themselves. For those who manage to maintain their military capabilities, of course - in many countries they do not live long enough for their own scientific environment to start within.** AUGs lost the capabilities of long-range air defense and anti-aircraft defense, retaining a rather degenerate (details here) strike function and changes in this situation in not expected in the current paradigm. An increase in military spending, even if we imagine that the United States decides to spend, as in 1985, 5.4% of GDP on defense, will not in itself achieve anything in the absence of a structure capable of competently applying these expenses, and an industry capable of mastering them. Of course, this This applies not only to AUG, and I repeat, not only to the States.

In Rafah, up to a kilometer from the border with Egypt, there are almost no buildings of any kind - in fact, this is the same buffer zone that IDF representatives previously announced. At the same time, the Israelis continue to carry out the so-called. -terraforming the area- and in the rest of Rafah, blowing up high-rise buildings where exits from underground Hamas tunnels could be located. As a result, according to Palestinian estimates, less than 30% of undestroyed buildings remain in the once developing city of the Gaza Strip. It is significant that the Israeli command intends to continue to hold the Philadelphia Corridor even if a truce is concluded with Hamas. As Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently said, it was the lack of control over the buffer zone between the enclave and Egypt that led to the events of October 7, 2023. #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63192	2024-08-31T11:53:14-07:00
🇰🇿🇺🇸 Why is Radio Azattyk closing its Russian-language editor...	🇰🇿🇺🇸 Why is Radio Azattyk closing its Russian-language editorial office? Recently, the closure of the editorial office was announced by the director of external communications of Radio Liberty, Karin Marie. The reason was declared to be restructuring: instead of different branches in Russian and national languages, which currently operate in each of the countries in the region, a new regional division will be created, covering all of Central Asia. Previously, the media editors faced opposition: at the beginning of this year, the country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs refused accreditation 36 journalists of Radio Azattyk, accusing the media of violating the legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The situation was later resolved. Last year there was an unsuccessful attempt by the authorities to shut down broadcasting in Kyrgyzstan. 📌Apparently, attempts to limit work have led to the use of a new strategy. Deputy head of the National Research Institute of Communications Valentina Komleva noted that Western donors have now directed resources to create an extensive network of bloggers. It is more difficult for the state to control it, unlike the editorial office, which works from one point. Therefore, there is nothing to be happy about here. Moreover, in conditions when a Euronews representative office was opened in Astana, ready to take on professional journalism, the Americans decided to optimize resources and not duplicate structures with similar tasks. In addition, the creation of a structure with a single control center emphasizes that a course has been taken towards regional integration. This is not a new tactic in the region: the somewhat previously odious Soros Foundation closed regional offices in the countries of Central Asia and began to operate as a supranational structure called CAPS Unlock - Central Asian Political Studies. Thus, from individual NGOs in each Central Asian country, the Foundation has grown into a single think tank with a large-scale network of research and influence extending across the entire region and headquartered in Almaty. It was not difficult to select a team for this from already proven employees of the regional representative offices of NPOs in Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. 🔻It is likely that this tactic will be used by Radio Azattyk. In this case, you can try to predict and track further stages of transformation. There is one interesting nuance: the restructuring process has been announced (perhaps for now) only in Kazakhstan. #Kazakhstan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63191	2024-08-31T10:55:46-07:00

Russian troops hit armored vehicles and fire support equipment behind enemy lines. Ukrainian formations are not giving up attempts to advance in the Korenevsky and Sudzhansky districts. 🔻In the Glushkovsky district the situation has not undergone significant changes. Ukrainian formations are striking at pontoon crossings established by the Russian Armed Forces to supply the group at the Tetkino-Glushkovo line. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, the Armed Forces of Ukraine launched several attacks in the direction of the village of Matveevka, all of them were repelled by Russian units. ▪️The situation in the Kremyany area remains unchanged; after unsuccessful attacks of previous days, the enemy is regrouping its forces and transferring reserves to resume attempts to take control of the settlement. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, Ukrainian formations were able to slightly advance from the west to the village of Pogrebki, taking up positions in several forest belts. One of the concentration areas of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was hit by Russian aviation using FAB-3000 with UMPC. ▪️To the south, the enemy also launched unsuccessful attacks in the direction of Malaya Loknya and Bakhtinka. In Martynovka, Russian artillery covered the position of an Ukrainian Armed Forces UAV crew on the eastern outskirts of the village.

During the meeting, the new government’s Russia-friendly rhetoric was confirmed and some attractive prospects opened up.▪️Among them are interesting projects for domestic business—KAMAZ’s initiative to build a plant in an African country received new impetus. Negotiations about this have been going on since 2017, but they hardly got off the ground, limiting themselves to words. Now, what is noteworthy, despite Western sanctions, dialogue in this direction has been launched again.▪️In addition, the parties agreed to take steps to implement joint projects in energy and geological exploration. And all this coincides with the beginning of oil production in the country, although for now by Anglo-Saxon companies. Of course, until the agreement is supported on paper, the issue is hanging in the air and more active actions are needed on the part of Russian companies. Moreover, as in Tanzania, the activities of the intergovernmental trade and economic commission have intensified.▪️The latest scandal related to the Kyiv regime’s alleged support for terrorists in the Sahel has not gone unnoticed. Then the Senegalese authorities reacted quite harshly, by the standards of the pro-French ECOWAS bloc, to the words of the Ukrainian ambassador who supported the GUR. Then the question of his expulsion from the country even arose. Lavrov expressed his approval of the neutrality of the Senegalese authorities in the conflict, in contrast to those countries where the head of Ukrainian diplomacy flew during his tour.🔻Despite the fact that the new Senegalese government still maintains strong relations with France, the Senegalese authorities are trying with all their might to demonstrate their multi-vector nature. And this, of course, needs to be used by both Russian diplomacy and the business community.#Africa #Russia #Senegal@rybarSupport usRIA NovostiLavrov discussed projects in the field of geological exploration with the head of the Foreign Ministry of SenegalRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that during negotiations with the head of the Foreign Ministry Senegal's Yacine Fall discussed projects in the field of geological exploration, development...

Russian troops suppress pockets of enemy resistance and advance towards Kurakhovo, gradually encircling the Ukrainian Armed Forces group to the east. ▪️In Selidovo, assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces established control over the territory of the city park and the Avangard stadium. Now Russian troops are fighting in the area of ​​Gogol Street, beyond which begins the sector of apartment buildings used by the enemy to build defenses in the city. To the south, advanced groups of Russian attack aircraft reached 8 September Street, knocking out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from several positions. Local residents report active artillery activity in the area of ​​the Malvina kindergarten, where the line of combat contact probably currently lies. ❗️West of Nagornaya Street there is a block of multi-storey buildings, which Ukrainian forces will likely seek to turn into a key defensive hub. Successfully overcoming the resistance of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in this area will allow the Russian Armed Forces to gain a foothold in the territory of the quarter and prevent the enemy from organizing a fortified line of defense. ▪️To the south, Russian troops, according to available information, liberated the settlement of Dolinovka, abandoned by the enemy due to the lack of opportunities to hold it. To the east, the Russian Armed Forces established control over most of Galitsynovka, knocking out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from positions on the southern bank of the Volchaya River. According to some information, advanced groups of Russian infantry have already entered the territory of Zhelanny First, while most of the enemy units have retreated from the populated area. ❗️Some sources also report the beginning of battles for Ukrainsk, but so far it is not possible to confirm this with objective control personnel and information from the field. 🔻The combat situation for the Armed Forces of Ukraine, apparently, is deteriorating more and more rapidly. Russian troops are actively advancing towards Kurakhovo, the enemy’s key transport hub, which poses a threat to the supply of several Ukrainian Armed Forces groups in other directions of the front. In addition, the situation in the Nevelskoye area remains unclear: according to unconfirmed reports, there is still a Ukrainian presence in the fields to the west of it formation. In this case, the advance of units of the RF Armed Forces towards Kurakhovo will actually mean that they will be surrounded.

🇺🇸🇧🇷 Blocking X in Brazil is a precedent for the whole world ...	🇺🇸🇧🇷 Blocking X in Brazil is a precedent for the whole world As a result of blocking the platform in the largest South American country, Musk’s company and all structures friendly to him were faced with the problem of losing the largest and -extremely desirable - (as some Western media write) media market, which flourished during the period of right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro is in power.▪️It’s no joke to lose more than 20 million users, provided that the platform lives off advertising. However, given the pressure from the opposing group of Western elites associated with the Democratic Party, this is becoming increasingly difficult to do. And if Kamala Harris takes the White House in January, the situation for the Musk group will become even worse. ▪️However, it’s not just Musk who is under fire—Mark Zuckerberg recently admitted to Congress that the White House put pressure on his platforms to censor content. As some experts suggest, he did this in case of a possible victory for Donald Trump in the upcoming elections. ▪️The situation with the situation of X in Brazil is significant because it is developing simultaneously with the arrest of Telegram owner Pavel Durov. Both events were (and are) accompanied by an active media campaign in the foreign segment regarding the dissemination of prohibited content, disinformation and incitement of radical sentiments on these platforms. 📌It goes without saying that they wrote more actively about Telegram, but most recently Frida @sex_drugs_kahlo talked about X’s dissatisfaction on the part of the UK authorities, who condemned Musk’s support for right-wing protesters and expressed claims that sound even more fun than the ruling from the Supreme Court of Brazil. 🔻Based on all of the above, it makes sense to talk about a new round of development of the digital market: most likely, a legal mechanism for regulating behavior in the online space will be formed, the virtual police apparatus will be officially consolidated, and after it the punitive apparatus. The era of digital freedom is officially approaching to its end.@rybar#Brazil #USASupport usTelegramRybar🇧🇷🇺🇸 About blocking X in Brazil On Friday, the South American country's Supreme Court Judge Alexandri de Moraes ruled to temporarily block the platform due to Elon Musk's refusal to appoint a legal representative of the company in the country within the prescribed period ( to…	https://t.me/rybar/63187	2024-08-31T07:20:01-07:00

However, a few hours later Moraes withdrew this sanction. ▪️Elon Musk, the owner of the social network, has already accused Moraes of trying to apply unreasonable censorship and of -closing the No. 1 source of truth in Brazil.- Musk’s statements have already been supported by some American Republican officials; Moraes, however, was not impressed. He insists that social networks need to be regulated because of incitement to hatred.▪️The situation was also commented on by the president of the South American country, Lula da Silva: he insisted that all businesses operating in the country must comply with legal obligations. Even if they have a lot of money.▪️Musk ridiculed the statement of the Brazilian leader, and called him a -lap dog.- Judge Moraes became a dictator.🔻Where did it all start? On August 17, the management of the social network X announced the closure of its office in Brazil, simultaneously accusing the Brazilian authorities of censorship. It was alleged that the day before Judge Moraes threatened a company representative with arrest if X did not comply with the court's orders. Even earlier - in April - the Supreme Court of Brazil included Elon Musk in an investigation concerning the spread of fake news in X and Musk's refusal to comply with di Moraes' order by removing those involved in eom a number of accounts on social networks. A separate investigation was also launched against the owner of X for obstructing the investigation. As a result of all the legal vicissitudes, Starlink bank accounts in Brazil, which were involved in the investigation into fakes, have now also been frozen. However, Starlink continues to provide free service to Brazilians (including military personnel) and on Friday submitted a petition to lift the block, which was rejected. @rybar in collaboration with @sex_drugs_kahlo#Brazil #USSupport usTelegram¿Por qué no te callas?🇧🇷 Without waiting, While the draconian measure on fines for VPN use is considered illegal, Judge Morais simply abandoned it by editing his ruling.

The command of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces reported that a Chinese electronic warfare aircraft approached the Danjio Islands so close that F-15 fighters were scrambled into the air to escort them.▪️In the South China Sea, the Chinese also responded demonstratively: to the increased frequency flights of the American MQ-4C UAV -Triton- in the Middle Kingdom sent fighters and a KJ-500 AWACS aircraft. Considering that -Triton- is called the naval version of the RQ-4B, and in this area clashes between Chinese and Philippine sailors regularly occur, what was the MQ-4C reconnaissance over the waters of the South China Sea is clear. This is the modern reality of the Asia-Pacific region, where a relatively stable region in which the main struggle unfolded in the information space has turned into a new arena of confrontation between geopolitical opponents.

The situation is most acute in Deir al-Balah and Khan Yunis, where, against the backdrop of regular strikes and occasional IDF offensives, the work of municipal services was virtually paralyzed. Long-term persistence of the garbage problem increases the risk of all kinds of epidemics, including polio, the first case of which in 25 years has already been recorded in the center of the Gaza Strip. The situation is also complicated by the rather dense population living in tents in the humanitarian zone, which leads to a faster spread of diseases. At the same time, at the beginning of the week, over a million polio vaccines were delivered to the enclave - they are gradually distributed among the remaining medical facilities. And although preparations for the vaccination campaign are in active progress, its implementation may require quite a lot of time due to the shortage of medical personnel, as well as the small number of working hospitals. #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63184	2024-08-31T05:21:00-07:00

The parties discussed cooperation in the field of mutual legal assistance. ▪️Vardapetyan stated that the US Embassy in Armenia is a reliable partner of the Prosecutor General’s Office. At the same time, none of them, of course, will be embarrassed by such a formulation by the obvious conflict of interests between the representative office of a foreign government and the branch of the executive power of Armenia. 📌Previously, US Deputy Secretary of State Uzra Zeya, during a visit to Yerevan, said that the Americans invested about $16 million in the formation of the Patrol Police in Armenia. The official then met with security officials and representatives of pro-Western NGOs and the media, the main pillars of American influence in Armenian society. 🔻All this fully characterizes the loss of Armenia’s sovereignty and the gradual transfer of all levers of control in the country into the hands of the Americans, who intend to thoroughly gain a foothold in the republic. At the same time, for the Western protégé of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, this is not the worst scenario, given that anti-government protests may begin again in the country. In this case, the support of the Americans and the security forces controlled by them will become a decisive factor in maintaining Pashinyan’s power. #Armenia #USA @rybarSupport usNEWS.amUS is committed to working with Armenia to help strengthen law enforcement agencies, ensure people's safetyUS Ambassador Kristina Kvien observed the training of Armenia's Marine Patrol at Lake Sevan, provided by the US International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL ) and US Department of Justice's International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program…	https://t.me/rybar/63183	2024-08-31T04:15:27-07:00

Nevertheless, footage and information from the field that appeared on the Internet clarified the situation. A difficult situation remains in the Glushkovsky district: Ukrainian formations continue to strike defensive formations and supply routes of the Russian Armed Forces, and are also preparing for a possible offensive in the area. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, the Armed Forces of Ukraine do not stop trying to advance in the vicinity of the administrative center - the village of Korenevo. However, each of them is successfully stopped by artillery fire.▪️To the east of Korenevo, the presence of Ukrainian formations in the forest area was previously recorded. At the same time, Kremyanoye is under the control of the Russian Armed Forces - it is periodically attacked by enemy forces, but to no avail. In the Sudzhansky district there are fierce battles along the entire line of contact. Ukrainian mobile groups are trying to advance in several areas, while Russian troops are responding with targeted strikes against identified targets.▪️On the northern flank, Ukrainian Armed Forces units launched attacks on the Malaya Loknya - Nechaev - Nizhnyaya Parovaya line. Videos have appeared on the Internet showing the defeat of members of Ukrainian formations near forest belts. At the same time, judging by the videos with hits by the Russian Armed Forces on enemy positions in Nizhnyaya Parovaya, the village is at least in the -gray zone-.▪️On the southern flank, based on objective control footage in the form of strikes on Cherkasy Konopelka and many reports from the Russian Ministry of Defense about strikes According to the same Plekhovo, the territory to the west of the indicated settlements is highly likely to be under the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Otherwise, the question arises as to why the enemy keeps Russian military personnel in his rear and carries out attacks towards the settlements of Borki and Russkaya Konopelka. 🔻The defeat of Ukrainian military units in the Sumy region also continues. A series of hits hit targets south and east of Sumy: as a result of the arrival of the Iskander OTRK, an ammunition depot in Nizhnyaya Syrovatka was destroyed, and a temporary deployment point came under fire in the village of Chernetchyna.

It is curious that in February of this year, the Russian Armed Forces already occupied these positions, however, apparently, from that moment they were lost. Judging by the footage, the enemy, who retreated to reserve positions, was subjected to several UAV attacks and retreated even further with losses. At the same time, whether the Russian attack aircraft managed to take up positions, and whether there was such a task at all, is an open question.

Especially in dense buildings , where on every floor, in every room an enemy can be hiding. And you can’t go further down one street without clearing dozens of houses. In the new issue, we decided to visualize one of the assaults, which fits into one line in the evening report, but for some it becomes the event of a lifetime. Synopsis: In June 2024, in Chasovoy Yar, assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces move forward, pushing back the enemy during the most difficult fights Ukrainian Armed Forces units are holding the defense, using many FPV drones and artillery shells with cluster warheads. In such conditions, even a small advance becomes a serious tactical success in the battle for the city. After all, while the attack aircraft take up a new position, the main forces can pull closer or move unnoticed. It’s good to talk about all this while being safe, but under fire, constantly risking the lives of both your own and your comrades, it can be very difficult to walk even 200-300 meters . But it is necessary. In June 2024, in Chasovoy Yar, assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces move forward, pushing back the enemy during the most difficult battles. Ukrainian Armed Forces units are holding the defense, using many FPV drones and artillery shells with cluster warheads. 📌 You can download the comic using the following links: RU | EN | AR | CN#Russia #Ukraine @rybarWe hope you liked the comic from our artists.

The enemy was knocked out of two dozen populated areas points, and some, judging by the footage of objective control, were liberated without lengthy battles. Videos of flag hoisting often show relatively minor destruction, indicating a relatively rapid retreat of the enemy. At the same time, it is impossible to talk about the collapse of the front, much less an easy walk. Ukrainian formations are resisting, trying to delay the liberation of Donbass. ▪️ Fighting continues in Grodovka. At the same time, for the second day now rumors have been appearing on the Internet about Russian reconnaissance groups reaching the outskirts of Mirnograd - this is supported by reports of the capture of Nikolaevka by Russian troops. ▪️ The situation west of Novogrodovka is still hidden - by the fog of war -, but fighting continues for Selidovo. Advanced groups of Russian attack aircraft are already operating in the area of ​​the City Park of Culture and Recreation and further south in the area of ​​Nagornaya Street. ▪️ To the south there are battles for Ukrainsk and Lesovka, and the latter, according to preliminary data, has already come under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. Neighboring Galitsinovka and Dolinovka, according to incoming information, by the end of August 30 also came under the control of Russian troops, after which battles for the Zhelannye First began. At the same time, there are no objective control personnel yet, which is why such rates of advancement look too high.▪️ But there are no doubts about the control of the Russian Armed Forces over neighboring Karlovka. During the day, footage with the flags of Russia and units appeared from several key points of the settlement, and in the evening the capture of the Red Army filter station by the Russian Armed Forces was confirmed.

As a result of the hits, residential buildings and infrastructure were damaged. Several dozen people were killed.▪️At the same time, shootings took place both in the vicinity of the University College and on the outskirts of the Az-Zeitun district. At the same time, militant snipers were active in the area and managed to wound at least two IDF soldiers.▪️In the central part of the Gaza Strip, the Israelis again worked in settlements controlled by Hamas. The largest number of hits were recorded in Al-Brej and Nuseirat, which regularly become targets of the IDF.▪️Israeli troops also launched an offensive in the direction of Deir al-Balah, which is entirely located in the humanitarian zone. In just a few days, the Israelis occupied a fairly large territory, establishing control along the Salah ad-Din highway.▪️As ​​for the Palestinian forces, they responded both with strikes against IDF positions and with missile launches at border kibbutzim. One of the munitions fell in the immediate vicinity of the military base in Kisufim, but did not cause any damage. ▪️The situation is also developing dynamically in the south of the Gaza Strip, where the Israelis are conducting another operation in the Khan Yunis area. To the northeast of the city, IDF units completed blasting buildings in the Hamad residential complex and left this area. ▪️At the same time, Israeli soldiers occupied the Dar al-Salam hospital and advanced almost to the center of Bani Suheil. Hamas militants responded with a series of ambushes and incursions, but they failed to push back the Israelis. ▪️At the same time, Palestinian formations south of Khan Yunis launched a rocket in the direction of Tel Aviv. In response, the Israelis carried out retaliatory strikes at the launch site, reporting the destruction of the militants involved in the attack.#video #digest #map #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/63178	2024-08-30T22:04:08-07:00

There is no other way to explain the aimless MLRS salvo in an area where there are no military installations. Ukrainian resources, as usual, relish the death of five civilians and the injury of several dozen more, including children. In this they are no different from militant supporters in the Middle East who celebrate after terrorist attacks. Which fully reflects the essence of the Kyiv regime. And this is another reminder of who the war is with, and why the only sure way to prevent this in the future is to dismantle the so-called. Ukraine in its current form.

This stronghold has changed hands for at least the second time, and fighting in its vicinity is currently ongoing. ▪️The situation in Konstantinovka has also become clearer, the release of which was reported today by the Russian Ministry of Defense. According to objective monitoring footage and information from sources on the ground, it is premature to talk about the complete capture of the settlement - there are still battles in it. The part of the village north of Dzherelnaya Street is highly likely to be a gray zone. Also, footage of a Russian UAV attack on Ukrainian Armed Forces vehicles near the intersection of Beregovaya Street and O0532 highway (T-05-24) was published on the Internet: according to our data, the Ukrainian Armed Forces still retain the ability to cross the Sukhie Yaly River via a bridge from the north. ▪️The situation in the Vodyanoye area is developing dynamically, where Russian troops have achieved success. The enemy was completely knocked out from the territory east of the O0532 highway and north of the Ikryannaya gully, and now the Russian Armed Forces are advancing towards Vodyanoye on a relatively wide front. However, the fact of fighting for the dachas of the 3rd mine, which was reported a few days ago, has not yet been confirmed.▪️In the Pavlovka area, Russian units expanded the zone of control towards Prechistovka, where servicemen of the Russian Armed Forces occupied several forest belts along the T-05-09 highway. The situation between Novomayorsky and Pavlovka has also become clearer - in this sector the offensive is proceeding from the initial positions in the area of ​​the Volchya gully (Volchiy Yar).

The reason, apparently, was the loss of the F-16AM fighter and the resulting scandal with the search for those to blame in the media field. It’s funny that when the Ukrainian Air Force lost almost 20 aircraft in a few months from strikes by the Russian Armed Forces on airfields, the leaders of the Kyiv regime asked Oleshchuk why something didn't arise. But as soon as he lost one American plane, he instantly lost his position. The situation clearly illustrates how the scale of the spread of the cargo cult to the so-called. Ukraine, and the level of external control from the West. When in Kyiv they are ready to do anything, as long as the sponsors are not too angry about the loss of an expensive and pathetically transferred wunderwaffe.#USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramTASS❗️Zelensky fired the commander of the Air Force of the Ukrainian Armed Forces after the crash of the F-16.	https://t.me/rybar/63169	2024-08-30T10:27:48-07:00

Since July, according to the positions of the separatists, the so-called. Azawad was struck daily by UAVs and government aircraft.❗️And recently, French sources began to note that the Malian authorities, together with the Wagner PMC, are preparing a revenge plan to occupy the Algerian border. Thus, in the city of Gao, a cluster of equipment, including trucks, armored vehicles and pickups. Presumably, the group for the campaign will consist of 600-800 military personnel, and in terms of numbers it is approximately comparable to that which at one time occupied the stronghold of the so-called militants. Azawad is the city of Kidal. Against the background of these rumors, the Algerian border service has been strengthened: if previously there was neutrality with the militants and they did not pose a threat, then thousands of refugees will create trouble. At the same time, the country’s authorities are also afraid of the conflict spreading to its territory, which is why additional army units have been deployed to the site.🔻So far, there is no evidence in open sources of the start of the offensive by the government forces of Mali and their allies: probably, so far only accumulation and other preparatory measures are taking place. At the same time, I would like to hope that previous reconnaissance mistakes and underestimation of the enemy will be taken into account, and the militants will not be treated as -ever-running shepherds.- High-resolution infographicsEnglish version#Africa #Mali @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63168	2024-08-30T10:10:14-07:00
🔁 🇦🇲🇺🇸 About the hearings of the US Helsinki Commission on A...	Forwarded From Systemic Pesticide🇦🇲🇺🇸 About the hearings of the US Helsinki Commission on Armenia The Helsinki Commission (US Mission to the OSCE) announced a hearing for September 10 on the topic -Supporting democracy in Armenia and its Western future-. ▪️The commission is formed from among employees of the State Department, as well as members of Congress. 📌The hearings on Armenia are timed to coincide with the results of the visit of senators and members of the Helsinki Commission to Yerevan in July. Then the Americans persistently discussed the closure of the Armenian nuclear power plant, which is serviced by the Russian Federation. In exchange, members of the US delegation promised to build an American station. The purpose of the visit was said to be to distance the republic from Russia. ▪️At the hearing, the commission will support all these theses, because the announcement indicates that they will discuss ways in which the United States can support Armenia in its democratic path, normalize ties with Azerbaijan and Turkey, and also in containing Russia’s malicious efforts. ▪️What kind of -malicious-actions of the Russian Federation are we talking about is unclear, except that the West is promoting exclusively the Azerbaijani-Turkish vector of development for Armenia.▪️At the same time, the announcement states that in Armenia there is supposedly a -public consensus regarding the European future of the country, and the republic itself is an example of democracy in the region, despite the brutal suppression of protests and persecution of oppositionists. ▪️The following will speak at the hearing: ➖Dan Bayer - vice president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (an undesirable organization in the Russian Federation)➖Olesya Vartanyan - a specialist on the South Caucasus from Georgia, writes for the American media, and also gives comments for a foreign agent publication - Radio Liberty-. In his publications, he promotes the idea that the Russian Federation is to blame for the seizure of Artsakh by Azerbaijan. ➖Tigran Grigoryan is the head of the pro-Western Regional Center for Democracy and Security in Yerevan. Its experts are graduates of American and British universities, as well as columnists for publications in these countries. One of the areas of the center’s work is the analysis of Russian influence in the South Caucasus. ▪️As we wrote earlier, the briefings of the Helsinki Commission are a litmus test by which one can determine the preparation of ideological theses for a new round of political and information campaigns. ▪️For example, it was the commission that actively supported the topic of -decolonization- of Russia in 2022, and recently they introduced a new topic - accusing the Russian Federation of ecocide on the so-called. Ukraine and decided to prepare official charges. In 2021, the commission also condemned amendments to the Constitution of the Russian Federation, saying that Americans know better what kind of government the citizens of Russia need. 🔻Now the Americans will determine how best to live for Armenia and how to expel their worst enemy, Russia, from the region. At the same time, trade relations with the Russian Federation ensure unprecedented growth in the Armenian economy in recent years. The Americans also exclude neighboring Iran, the protector of the interests of Armenians in the region, from the political landscape of Armenia. The United States will defend exclusively the Azerbaijani-Turkish vector of development of Armenia, where Armenians are treated with extreme disdain. Pro-Western Armenians are only happy to receive attention from Washington, not noticing that they are being pushed through the most unpleasant scenario for the future. #Armenia #USA @pezdicide no chemistry - just factsTelegramRybar🇦🇲🇺🇸 On the purposes of visits of US delegations to Armenia Last week, an American bipartisan delegation led by Senator Roger Wicker visited Armenia. ▪️The composition of the American delegation is more than indicative.

Previously, such footage was mainly shown by Ukrainian resources, but now footage of downed enemy UAVs is emerging. This is another example of how the revolution in unmanned aerial vehicles has changed the landscape of the battlefield. In a year and a half, FPV drones have gone from garage handicrafts to full-fledged attack systems with artificial intelligence systems. The area of ​​their use is growing to the point of being used as ersatz air defense.📌 In itself, the destruction of wings by FPV drones is not such a simple task and requires a certain level of organization with calculations of detection means. However, with its presence, reconnaissance UAVs can be shot down, saving much more expensive anti-aircraft missiles and without giving away the positions of the air defense systems. In this case, the question of what exactly the fight against such FPV interceptors will look like in the near future is whether everything will be limited to a change in the tactics of using wings, or whether they will even begin to be equipped with some technical devices. #UAV #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramOlder EddaHere Such a drone of the Ukrainian Armed Forces shot down our FPV 3 crew of the Army of the Southern Military District today.

🇨🇳🇵🇭 On the development of the Philippine military infrastruc...	🇨🇳🇵🇭 On the development of the Philippine military infrastructure on the disputed islands Amid renewed clashes between the Chinese and the Philippines in the South China Sea, authorities in Manila continue to develop military infrastructure on their territories in the waters. Over the past few months, the Philippine leadership has announced the construction of several facilities on Thitu Island, where it is planned to build new barracks and an airport. This piece of land is extremely important for the Philippines for several reasons:▪️Firstly, it is the largest piece of land controlled by the Philippines in the South China Sea - its hypothetical loss would be a serious challenge for the country.▪️Secondly, Thitu is located close to the possessions China and Vietnam. Presence on the island allows you to observe the actions of neighboring countries, which have been strengthening and expanding their territories for a long time. Therefore, calling the Philippines’ activity on this island a provocation is still not entirely correct, especially since others are engaged in similar activities (often on a much larger scale). participants in a territorial dispute. Although, if the construction of the airfield on Thitu is completed, the probability of the appearance of American aviation will not be zero. The bottom line is that plans to expand the military infrastructure on the part of the Philippine leadership still risk causing the emergence of another new point of confrontation in the waters. #China #Philippines@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usTelegramFisherman🇵🇭🇨🇳 The Philippines will soon enter the race to expand the disputed islands in the South China Sea - along with China, Taiwan and Vietnam: the commander-in-chief of the country’s armed forces recently announced plans for large-scale construction on nine controlled islands.…	https://t.me/rybar/63165	2024-08-30T08:26:29-07:00

The death of the group’s deputy commander, as we wrote earlier, is a significant loss for the Ukrainian Air Force.▪️Part of the shortage of Ukrainian Armed Forces pilots will be able to be compensated by mercenaries from among retirees in NATO countries. However, this will in any case make adjustments to the use of the F-16, introducing the so-called. Ukraine is even more dependent on their use.▪️With the increase in the number of F-16s in the territory controlled by the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the issue of their protection becomes urgent - with shelters, things are familiar there, and only three airfields with Soviet reinforced concrete structures in the western regions save the situation. Therefore, the enemy will clearly try to remove aircraft from attack in neighboring NATO countries with all the consequences. In general, so far the use of the F-16, as can be judged, is sporadic. However, its peak has yet to pass - Ukrainian formations will clearly use them for massive attacks with long-range Western-made cruise missiles.#USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇺🇦 The Ukrainian side published an obituary, which states the death of Lieutenant Colonel Alexei Mes as a result of a missile strike by the Russian Armed Forces at one of the airfields on August 26.

On the Internet, almost every day you can see footage from the coast of Deir al-Balah, which is literally studded with all kinds of tents.

Both were members of the Ukrainian formation - the Carpathian Sich - and participated in battles in the Northern Military District zone since the summer of 2023. However, the most important point is the details of the arrest that were revealed: as it turned out, they were arrested at the Caracas airport, through which the militants wanted to get home to neighboring Colombia. After this, the Venezuelan authorities extradited two soldiers of failure to Russia. And this is indeed a very important precedent, at least from an information point of view.▪️On the one hand, what happened in practice demonstrates the theses of the Russian authorities about their readiness to persecute mercenaries around the world who fought on the side of the Kyiv mode. After all, loud statements are one thing, and another thing is when militants are actually taken to jail.▪️ At the same time, this is perhaps the first public episode when foreign countries extradite to Russia persons who participated in hostilities on the side of the so-called. Ukraine. Previously, foreign courts had already arrested mercenaries, but there was no talk of extradition to Russian territory. In general, what happened is a clear example of why it is necessary to establish contacts through law enforcement agencies and, in general, connections with countries of the global South.

According to him, the focus now is on the topic of a stable parliamentary majority. ▪️ Let us remind you that it is in Baku that they insist on amendments to the Constitution of Armenia and have claims specifically to the Declaration of Independence, which contains territorial claims. ▪️Without amendments to the Armenian Constitution, the Azerbaijani side refuses to sign a peace treaty, which, in the event of a change of power in Yerevan, may be declared unconstitutional. ▪️However, this does not mean that the working group for writing the new Constitution of Armenia will not consider these issues in the future. ❗️Rather, such a statement can be regarded as a concession to public opinion, in which changing the Constitution is associated with fulfilling the demands of Azerbaijanis. ▪️Moreover, the opposition announced protests in September, which are tied to the thesis of trampling national interests and capitulation to the demands of Baku. 🔻In general, delaying the Constitution issue until 2027 brings negotiations between Yerevan and Baku to a dead end. Previously, Azerbaijan agreed to exclude the unblocking of communications from the agreement, although this is a key issue for the region. The inability (or rather, the unwillingness agreed on by both sides) to come to an agreement could ultimately lead to new aggression on the part of Baku. #Azerbaijan #Armenia&nbsp; @rybarSupport usSputnik ArmeniaThe constitutional referendum in Armenia is planned to be held in 2027 - Minister Grigor Minasyan presented to journalists some details of the discussions related to the future referendum.	https://t.me/rybar/63161	2024-08-30T04:13:31-07:00

Heavy battles continue in the Kursk region. Ukrainian formations are increasing their reserves and continuing attacks in several areas. At the same time, the concentration of enemy forces remains high even taking into account the active work of the Russian Aerospace Forces aviation. 🔻The situation in the Glushkovsky district remains difficult. The information that appeared yesterday about cutting off Tetkino by destroying bridges has not yet received confirmation, and, apparently, is a fake. Ukrainian formations conduct reconnaissance and attack positions of the Russian Armed Forces and crossings. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, fighting continues in the vicinity of the administrative center; the enemy does not stop trying to advance with both infantry and armored groups. To the south there are battles in the Korenevo-Krasnooktyabrskoye-Snagost triangle. 🔻Clashes also continue in the Sudzhansky district. In the Kamyshevka-Kireevka section, Russian troops repelled an attack by an armored group of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Another small infantry group was scattered by artillery fire while advancing from Nechaevo, where the enemy had entrenched himself in the forest southwest of the village. The village itself was previously liberated by the Russian Armed Forces. To the south, in the areas of the settlements of Borki, Plekhovo and Cherkasskaya Konopelka, the Russian Armed Forces are searching for and destroying the invasion forces.

Even the press sympathetic to the Democrats wrote that Harris and Walz behaved inexpressively, and the CNN interviewer was too soft, although for the sake of decency she pressed politicians on some issues.🔻Here are a few main highlights from the event:▪️Harris was caught in the act of regularly changing her shoes: when asked if she still believes, as in 2020, that unauthorized border crossing should be decriminalized, Harris replied: -I believe there should be consequences- .Same thing with fracking - despite the fact that a couple of years ago she was strongly opposed, now her position has changed in the opposite direction.▪️Harris understands that the outcome of the election will be decided by seven swing states, so she is trying hard to win over Republicans. who doubt the rationality of voting for Donald Trump. Therefore, when asked whether she would appoint a Republican to any position in her administration, she answered positively.▪️ -Boring- - this is how Trump reacted to Kamala’s interview. However, this is good for Harris and Walz - none of them made big mistakes or said too much, which means the campaign continues. Another reflection of the current strategy of the Democrats - quietly, without debating or bickering with anyone, make Kamala president with the help of beautiful photographs, videos and pre-prepared interviews.🇺🇸 @usaperiodical	https://t.me/rybar/63158	2024-08-30T01:03:33-07:00

The essence is to order a taxi to random addresses in another country and cancel the order as soon as the car arrives. Such initially small antics have become so universal. that the main taxi calling service Bolt first suspended operations in these countries, and then worked on bugs to calculate cross-country taxi calls and block thousands of users who joined the flash mob. Debates between residents of countries arise constantly at the local level. For example, pop stars can exchange insults against each other's national teams. But the reason for the conflict was the awarding of the title of Miss South Africa to a dark-skinned girl whose name hints at her Nigerian origin. Because of this, social media users demanded her return to her homeland, although she is actually from Mozambique. This incident led to a wave of disputes between Nigerians and South Africans, which resulted in a troll war.🔻It is unlikely that the owners of online services have felt any better about realizing the curiosity of the situation, because the losses from the suspension of work have yet to be assessed. And the problem with calling a taxi for the sake of a joke should become an instructive lesson for other companies where a similar vulnerability can be exploited.

Explosions and air defense operations were recorded in Krivoy Rog and several settlements in the Kyiv region, as well as in Sumy. In the Kursk region, the enemy continues to accumulate reserves and does not stop attacks in the Sudzhansky and Korenevsky regions. There are battles near Korenevo and Olgovka; several enemy assault groups have been destroyed near Borki and Martynovka. In the Kupyansko-Svatovsky direction, Russian troops advanced in the area of ​​​​Peschany and Tabaevka, as well as near Sinkovka and, according to some reports, liberated Stelmakhovka. In the Aleksandro-Kalinovsky direction, Druzhba was almost completely liberated, battles are taking place on the outskirts of the Dzerzhinsk administration and the east of Dzerzhinsk itself. In the Pokrovsky direction, the offensive of Russian troops also continues, the waste heap and the Novogrodovskaya mine were captured, which confirms control over Novogrodovka, an assault is underway on Selidovo, and, according to some reports, on Ukrainsk. Against the background of news about the loss of the first F-16, destroyed or crashed during a recent massive strike by the Russian Armed Forces, activity of similar aircraft is recorded in the Kharkov and Odessa regions.

Assault groups operate on the northwestern outskirts of the village. Moreover, taking into account the source of personnel, in reality the settlement may already be completely liberated. To the east of the village, at least part of the forest belts on both sides of the Seversky Donets - Donbass canal was also cleared.▪️There are battles in Kirovo (Pivnichny), and most of the settlement has also come under the control of Russian troops. The enemy presence remains in the northwestern outskirts north of the cemetery. However, given the ongoing clashes, it is most likely that Ukrainian forces will try to engage and hold Dachne to the west for as long as possible. ▪️On the eastern outskirts of Dzerzhinsk (Toretsk), advanced groups of attack aircraft some time ago were able to occupy the intersection of Tereshkova Street and the 91st Division. There are battles for the territory of the Central Hospital and garages to the south. Toretsk correctional colony No. 2 could become one of the enemy’s complex defense centers, but only if the operational crisis does not worsen. The situation in the neighborhoods on the southern outskirts, in the area of ​​Gaidar Street, remains hidden in the fog of war. Russian troops launched an attack through the territory of a mental hospital that had been occupied earlier, but how successful it is remains unclear. ▪️The situation is similar in the Nelepovka area and north of Novgorod (New York). There has been no information about new attacks by the Russian Armed Forces or counterattacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, but this does not directly indicate a lull.

There was also a shootout on the southern outskirts of the Az-Zeitoun district. The first case of polio was recorded in the central part of the enclave. Previously, over a million vaccines were delivered to the region, which were distributed to medical institutions that continued to operate. In the south of the Gaza Strip, IDF units occupied the Dar al-Salam hospital on the outskirts of Khan Yunis and advanced further along the Salah al-Din highway, where they almost reached the central part of Bani Suheila . In the West Bank, Israeli security forces carried out one of the largest raids in recent weeks, as a result of which more than 40 local residents were detained and several militant commanders were killed.

Forwarded From Awakening Dragon 🐲🇺🇸🇨🇳 US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, at a press conference following his trip to China, said that Washington and Beijing have not made progress in discussing a solution to the Ukrainian conflict. In general, it would be a mistake to believe that this or that part of the Ukrainian issue will be resolved at such meetings. Just look at the White House press release following the meeting between Sullivan and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The issue of the Ukrainian crisis is clearly not in the first place - the same is evident in the document, which is dedicated to the meeting of an American official with the Chinese Foreign Minister. If some people expected progress on this issue as a result of meetings aimed primarily at stabilizing Sino-American relations, then perhaps this week's negotiations were initially perceived incorrectly. @awaken_dragonTelegram The video shows ⚡️ China and the United States have made no progress in discussing a solution to the Ukrainian crisis, have not outlined any plan - Biden assistant Sullivan ▶️ Subscribe to WATCH	https://t.me/rybar/63148	2024-08-29T10:32:21-07:00

Forwarded From Informant The Air Command of the Ukrainian Armed Forces also got in touch and posted an official obituary for F-16 pilot Alexey Mes. According to the text, the fighter he controlled was hunting Russian cruise missiles and kamikaze drones during a massive missile strike on August 26, allegedly shooting down three cruise missiles and one UAV, but killing himself. This formulation hints that the F-16 was either shot down by its own air defense fire, which also fired at missiles and drones, or its fighter crashed into one of the air targets, by the way, there was already such a precedent in the Air Force - in December 2022, the MiG-29, while hunting for -Geranium-, he lost and crashed into the wreckage of a drone. Although the assumption of a missile strike on the F-16 is still not ruled out, the official version broadcast by Ukrainian officials is ridiculous in its absurdity: the long-awaited Western fighter under the control of a pilot, which took a year and a half to develop, simply fell apart on a rocket or -Geranium- after just three weeks of its presence in Ukraine, you don’t even need to imagine the faces of your Western partners.

The enemy introduces parts of the TrO into the territory of the Russian Federation as reinforcement units, and in the adjacent territory of the Sumy region the movements of large concentrations of personnel are recorded. In addition, it is planned to transfer 92 brigades in full force to Sudzha and the surrounding area.🔻In the Glushkovsky district, the situation remains extremely tense. Information has appeared on the Internet about cutting off Tetkino by destroying bridges, but so far there is no clear evidence of this. At the same time, we reported both about the enemy’s possibility of this move and about its high probability two weeks ago. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, the enemy does not stop trying to advance in the Korenevo area, while simultaneously transferring forces to the vicinity of Olgovka and to the settlement itself, where he is advancing within the borders of the village and in the direction of Durovka. ▪️From time to time, information appears about the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ attempts to advance in the direction of Sheptukhovka, but so far without specifics. Scattered enemy groups were previously recorded both to the west and east of the village, while the capture or liberation of adjacent villages was not clearly reported. ▪️To the south there are battles in the vicinity of Komarovka. The enemy tried to attack, but was stopped, after which he rolled back to Vishnevka. The latter remains under the control of Ukrainian formations; there have been no reports of counterattacks by the Russian Armed Forces in the area. 🔻There are also battles in the Sudzhansky district, the enemy is not reducing activity. In the area of ​​Leonidovka, Pokrovsky and Lyubimovka, Ukrainian formations are accumulating assault groups with the aim of further advancement. ▪️Fighting also continues in Borki, where the Ukrainian Armed Forces are trying to advance with the forces of units of the 92nd Special Brigade and two TrO battalions. The enemy fears an attack from Pushkarny, where he was actively conducting reconnaissance.

This time we decided to clearly examine what the new plan of the Ukrainian command might be: unlike last year’s offensive attempt, the enemy is preparing for a possible attack in the west of the region - there, after occupying Vasilyevka, the Ukrainian Armed Forces will have the opportunity to advance both towards the Zaporizhia NPP and Tokmak. As we have already noted, such plans of the Ukrainian command are indicated by the increasing frequency of satellite imagery of Russian Armed Forces facilities and the simultaneous concentration of forces towards Primorsky. There, according to various estimates, up to four brigades could have accumulated at the moment - it is they who can be used as a strike force. And although it is not entirely clear when and where the enemy will decide to bring his plan into reality, it is important to understand that he did not abandon the offensive on this section of the front, even despite the worsening operational crisis of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Pokrovsky, Aleksandro-Kalinovsky, and Yuzhnodonetsk directions. #video #Zaporozhye #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63145	2024-08-29T08:06:46-07:00

Forwarded From Two Majors On the eve of the presidential elections and the European referendum in 🇲🇩Moldova, the influence of ⚡️NATO countries is increasing. After the visit of the saboteur German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to Chisinau on August 21, the first outlines of future cooperation began to appear. What they expected was not investing in the restoration of decrepit infrastructure, but increasing the country’s military potential. The German Minister of Defense announced a contract for the European branch of General Dynamics (GD) to overhaul 14 Piranha armored personnel carriers, which will be delivered to the Moldovan Armed Forces as part of military-technical assistance. In addition, the company’s specialists will train Moldovan military personnel in the operation of this equipment. Previously, we reported on deliveries&nbsp; Germany&nbsp; up to 20 Piranha armored personnel carriers, medical equipment and patrol boats. At the same time, military maneuvers with NATO countries continued, designed to increase interoperability with the countries of the Alliance. From August 5 to 23, multinational exercises - Fire Shield 2024 - took place in Moldova with the participation of the US Armed Forces and Romanian Armed Forces. NATO's presence in all areas of defense is expanding. August 1, 2024 Deputy The head of the Border Police of Moldova A. Trofimov met with the British Assistant Minister for Combating Organized Crime and Illicit Finance K. Holden. It is planned to establish a direct exchange of information on combating illegal migration, drug trafficking and other cross-border crimes. In addition, on August 6, Moldovan border guards received five FurSeal 485 boats from Germany (in order to better catch Uhilants from Ukraine). Romania continued the physical absorption of Moldova. Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure of Romania through the company Administrația Porturilor Maritime S.A. Constanța plans to buy shares in the port of Giurgiulesti. As comrade @rybar reports, on August 28, 2024, a decision was made to create a commission to resolve this issue. Against this background, published statistics indicate the increasing decline of Moldova. According to the latest data, 41.9% of Moldovan citizens aged 14-34 years are outside the country. It is significant that against the backdrop of the devastation of the 90s,&nbsp; depreciation of infrastructure accumulated&nbsp; debts, corruption and population outflow, EU and NATO countries&nbsp; concentrate their efforts specifically on the military sphere.&nbsp; ✨After slave Ukraine destroys its combat-ready population, pays off all its property for debts and can no longer carry out the commands of its Western masters, it will be replaced by Moldova.

Moreover, today the relatives of the hostages held a demonstration not in the usual Tel Aviv or Jerusalem, but in close proximity to the border with the Palestinian enclave. Armed with posters and loudspeakers, they shouted the names of their loved ones and even managed to break through one of the barriers on the way to the Gaza Strip. Nevertheless, the Israeli security forces managed to restrain the dissatisfied and persuade them to go to the nearby border kibbutz Nirim - according to media reports, there were no casualties. Be that as it may, this is not the first demonstration of relatives of hostages near the Gaza Strip. Previously, they had repeatedly rallied at checkpoints, preventing convoys carrying humanitarian aid for Palestinians from entering the enclave. Apparently, this time a new strategy of action was chosen, which, however, was assessed quite positively in some Israeli media. #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63140	2024-08-29T06:14:55-07:00
☢️🇰🇿 How Western NGOs in Kazakhstan are looking for an alternat...	☢️🇰🇿 How Western NGOs in Kazakhstan are looking for an alternative to Rosatom The rhetoric of the Kazakh authorities regarding nuclear power plants has undergone dramatic changes. If this winter in Astana they expressed doubts about the need to build a nuclear power plant, now Kazakhstan is ready to build at least three. One, at least, is absolutely necessary, and there is no alternative to this solution. At a government meeting chaired by Prime Minister Olzhas Bektenov, this was stated by the Minister of Energy of the Republic of Kazakhstan Almasadam Satkaliev. He also called the attitude towards the nuclear power plant construction project a test of intelligence, patriotism and decency. This warm-up from the government of the Republic of Kazakhstan came just in time for the KazAtomExpo exhibition, which took place on August 27-28. The country's Ministry of Energy announced it as the first business platform where the current state of the nuclear industry and its readiness to move to a new level in the form of nuclear power plant construction will be discussed. As expected, the dialogue involves representatives of all four companies that are considered as potential contractors for the construction of a nuclear power plant: Électricité de France, Rosatom, China National Nuclear Corporation and Korea Hydro &amp; Nuclear Power Co.📌At this point, Kazakh bloggers and media associated with Western NGOs had to abandon their obvious opposition to the construction of a nuclear power plant in general and choose the course of promoting all projects except the Russian one. A striking example was the sudden lobbying of the Chinese CNNC: -on the sidelines of KazAtomExpo, the deputy chief representative of the Chinese National Nuclear Corporation for Central Asia and Eastern Europe, Li Yudong, told reporters the price - 20 billion yuan for one block and the period - five years for construction.🔻This news is from catchy, but not true, headlines - Cheaper and faster than Rosatom - very quickly spread across the information field. The only thing is that the construction of a block actually takes so much time, but two blocks are needed and they are built sequentially, with a difference of one or two years between them. And also, before starting to build the blocks, a site is prepared for the future station and a nuclear power plant construction plant is installed on it, which makes concrete, metal structures and fittings on site. Consequently, both the final price of the issue and the timing of the Chinese project will be, to put it mildly, somewhat different.❗️In a word, passions for nuclear power plants are heating up before the referendum, and the question of who will build a nuclear power plant in the Republic of Kazakhstan becomes the cornerstone until The draft government decree on holding the people's will is sent for signature to the President of Kazakhstan. #Kazakhstan #energy @rybarSupport usNUR.KZ Kazakhstan will need at least three nuclear power plants if the issue is approved in a referendum. At a briefing in the government, the head of the Ministry of Energy was asked how many nuclear power plants Kazakhstan will need if Kazakhstanis approve it in a referendum development of the nuclear industry in the country, NUR.KZ correspondent reports.	https://t.me/rybar/63139	2024-08-29T05:19:43-07:00
🇦🇫🇺🇸🇺🇿 Indeed, news about the fate of weapons has not flash...	🇦🇫🇺🇸🇺🇿 Indeed, for a long time there was no news in the press about the fate of the weapons and equipment of the former Afghan National Army, which Afghan soldiers evacuated to Uzbekistan in 2021. And now the American Ambassador in Tashkent Jonathan Henick announced that American-made equipment has been transferred to use the Uzbek army, with which a joint program is already being implemented.🔻In total, 22 planes and 24 helicopters hit Uzbekistan. Among them were examples of A-29 Super Tucano attack aircraft and over a dozen UH-60 Black Hawk, MD-530 and Mi-17 helicopters. For the Uzbek army this is a truly serious package of assistance, provided that the equipment is in proper condition and is available . For example, it has been said more than once about the same Afghan Mi-17s that they were transferred to the so-called Ukraine. It is curious what the Americans expect to receive in return (or have already received). Remember the leaked files about US interaction with countries in the region? Then the Pentagon made a request about Soviet weapons from the Uzbeks for transfer to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It’s definitely not worth believing that the Americans are good philanthropists. Even the $64 million renovation of six PC-12 aircraft, which was announced a couple of weeks ago, will come with a price tag. And it’s very interesting which one. #Afghanistan #USA #Uzbekistan@rybarSupport usKun.uz The US Ambassador announced an agreement with Uzbekistan on aircraft from Afghanistan.

🖼 🇸🇴Situation in Somalia: arrival of Egyptian and Turkish cont...	🇸🇴The situation in Somalia: arrival of the Egyptian and Turkish contingents Summary for August 1 - 28, 2024 Events in Somalia have been developing very actively lately. So, just a month after the signing of the memorandum on the deployment of Turkish troops in the country, the first military personnel arrived from Djibouti. As we wrote earlier, the Ankara authorities will play the role of a conductor of Western influence in the country. At the same time, the first troops of the Egyptian contingent landed in Mogadishu. Its total strength will be 10 thousand people, half of which will belong to the African Union ATMIS mission, which the West actively wants to squeeze out, and the other will be located independently.❗️And here the Somali territory again becomes an arena for the clash of interests of regional players. The Egyptian authorities once again want to create a counterbalance to Ethiopian influence. And recent events related to the water conflict on the Nile River have only intensified the escalation between the countries. In response to this move, the Ethiopian military began to concentrate forces along the border with Somalia. In addition, they began to openly defy the Somali authorities, leaving ATMIS bases without meeting the withdrawal schedule and handing them over to nearby militias without waiting for government forces.▪️The military situation inside the country remains just as turbulent. Terrorists from the Al-Qaeda-linked group Al-Shabab are intensifying attacks on the outskirts of Mogadishu. So, for a month, they shelled the Seeelasha Biiaha area using mortars, and also used suicide vehicles to attack civilian targets. Notable is the terrorist attack on the Doolo-Luke highway, occupied by Ethiopia. For the first time ever, group activity was noted there; one of the convoys of the pro-Ethiopian militia was ambushed. Government forces responded by conducting several counter-terrorism operations along the coast, displacing the militants from some villages and forests. True, no one is trying to gain a foothold in the occupied positions, so after the raid the territory remains in a gray zone. But in general, the situation remains stable, the militants cannot deliver a serious blow to the Somali troops, just as government forces are not gaining a foothold after counter-terrorism operations. However, disagreements between regional players risk creating a security vacuum, which various groups will not fail to take advantage of.

Judging by the calmness of the fighter with the flag, there is no enemy in the nearest houses, which means confident control over at least the north of the settlement. However, most of the village has changed hands more than once and is therefore heavily ruined. ▪️Another place of success of the Russian Armed Forces is the surroundings of Peschany, where Russian troops are advancing in the forest belts north of the village and west of Tabaevka. Based on objective control footage, the enemy was knocked out from height 169.2 at the intersection of several power lines north of the Peschanaya River. ▪️In other sectors of the Russian Armed Forces, they are working to search and destroy enemy positions and equipment. In particular, another Ukrainian Armed Forces tank was hit to the west of Ivanovka.🔻In this area, the enemy’s defense lines are built along a chain of settlements along the eastern bank of Oskol with a relatively small removal of strongholds in the gullies to the east, and therefore we can assume the emergence of a new lull, accompanied by strikes on river crossings induced by the enemy.

According to CNN Türk, citing diplomatic sources, Turkey set four conditions for the withdrawal of their troops: ➖Complete disposal of terrorist elements to preserve territorial integrity and unity;➖Reconciliation with one’s own people based on legitimate demands within the framework of UN Security Council Resolution 2254;➖Creation of the necessary conditions for the safe return of refugees;➖Continuous continuation of the supply of humanitarian aid to the areas , under the control of the opposition.🔻If we interpret this literally, then the Turks are not going to withdraw troops from Syria. To remember what conditions are currently developing in Syria due to the actions of the Western coalition, their allies and the Turks themselves - the implementation of these points is unrealistic. How will the Syrian government get rid of all terrorists if the same militants - Hayat Tahrir al-Sham - are sponsored by the Turkish leadership, and Are ISIS survivors being released from prison by the Kurds at the direction of their handlers? We are not taking into account the humanitarian situation due to sanctions, the destructive influence of the West on the economy and the rocking of the internal political situation in ethnically troubled regions such as Es-Suwayda, where the Druze live.❗️ Of course, this was completely expected. For the Turks, the withdrawal of troops would be tantamount to admitting defeat, and this would already affect Erdogan’s already low rating. Unfortunately, all this does not bode well for Syria in the coming years, and given the preconditions for the revival of the Islamic State, everything could get even worse.#Syria #Turkey@rybarSupport usRIA NovostiThere is no progress in the issue of rapprochement between Damascus and Ankara, Assad said.

This, according to media reports, led to the fact that agents, including those located in Russia and China, urgently had to change their personal data. ▪️The case is gaining new details. According to law enforcement officials, the person who disseminated secret information worked for China.▪️The prosecutor's office claims that the accused began leaking data in June 2022. In total, he demanded approximately $300 thousand for them, of which he received less than half. 🔻By the way, the leak itself is indirectly confirmed by events that occurred earlier. For example, in March 2024, the first Korean citizen in Russian history was detained on suspicion of espionage. In July of this year, proceedings began in the United States in the case of a former CIA employee - she is suspected of collaborating with South Korean intelligence. Most likely, the mentioned detentions occurred precisely due to a large-scale leak of data.

The Moldovan media claimed that the bank bought 100% of the shares for only 1 thousand euros. The EBRD denied the information, but for some reason refused to name the amount of the transaction. ▪️Now they intend to buy the port in Romania, especially since the Moldovan authorities encourage the transfer of all strategic assets of the state to Bucharest. The Romanian company already owns the gas transmission networks of Moldova, and negotiations are also underway on the privatization of the country's energy networks by Bucharest. ▪️Previously, the Romanian government also stated that the Moldovan side would not be the subject of negotiations in the deal with the EBRD. After this, timid voices were heard in Sandu’s office that negotiations should not take place without the government of Moldova, but hardly anyone cares about their opinion. Note that the coastal strip for the construction of the port was transferred to Chisinau by Ukraine in 2006. The only port was supposed to make Moldova more independent and ensure the growth of the national economy. This would also free Moldova from dependence on nearby ports - Ukrainian Reni and Romanian Constanta. As a result, the Romanians eliminate their failed competitor in the form of Moldova. The main beneficiary of cargo flow through the port will be Romania, whose authorities have already announced their ambitions to use money to restore the so-called infrastructure.

Russian troops hit military infrastructure in several regions at once, the so-called. Ukraine. In the Sumy region, as a result of an airstrike, an Ukrainian Armed Forces crossing in the Akhtyrsky district was destroyed; it is also known that enemy military installations in Konotop were successfully hit. Ukrainian formations carried out a UAV raid on Russian territory within 24 hours. Drone attacks hit oil industry facilities in the Voronezh and Rostov regions. In the Kursk direction, the Ukrainian Armed Forces launched unsuccessful attacks in several areas of the Kursk region. At the same time, the enemy used the HIMARS MLRS to attack the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, but the station was not damaged. In the Aleksandro-Kalinovsky direction, the Russian Armed Forces expanded the zone of control in Dzerzhinsk, and also knocked out the enemy from some positions in the area of ​​the Novaya mine. To the south, according to some information, the Russian Armed Forces began to storm Nelepovka. In the Pokrovsky direction, Russian attack aircraft liberated most of Grodovka, and also established control over the waste heap of the mine named after. Korotchenko.

For example, operational-tactical complexes - Grom-2 - were regularly used for attacks in Crimea in 2022. They were extremely inaccurate, and our air defense units shot them down without any problems, after which Grom-2 disappeared from the radar. Nevertheless, there were ballistic missiles, so Zelensky’s words sound strange. Or maybe he's talking about converted S-200 anti-aircraft missiles? They also fly along a ballistic trajectory, and, drawing by the ears, they can be classified as this type. We must also not forget about the Tochka-U, the Soviet reserves of which ran out by the beginning of 2023, but the Ukrainian military-industrial complex, with the help of the West, managed to partially remake the complexes and to establish missile production, which is why the Dots began to glow again at the front.❗️But something else is more likely: the Ukrainian leader simply decided to cheer up the population with a long-known fact and distract from the failures in the Donetsk direction. What -Grom-2-, what S-200, what -Tochki- are now either not used at all or extremely limited, and the disclosure of this information will not affect the course of the conflict in any way.#Ukraine@rybarSupport usPOLITICOUkraine successfully tests its first ballistic missile – POLITICOUkraine's president offers no details on the test, but says that it was -positive.-	https://t.me/rybar/63126	2024-08-28T11:14:58-07:00

Russian troops are rapidly expanding their penetration into the defensive lines of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and have already started fighting on the outskirts of Selidovo, and also knocked out the enemy from the central part of Grodovka. ▪️On the northern flank, Russian attack aircraft achieved significant success in Grodovka, knocking out Ukrainian formations from the left bank of the Zhuravka River. There are also battles in Nikolaevka, the last major defensive hub of the Armed Forces of Ukraine before Mirnograd. For a further attack on Mirnograd, the Russian Armed Forces will have to overcome defensive lines north of Nikolaevka and Grodovka, consisting of at least five large strongholds. The enemy will probably make every effort to hold these positions and slow down the advance of the Russian Armed Forces by transferring reserves. ▪️In the Novogrodovka area, Russian troops are consolidating in the occupied territories. To the west of the city lies a large open space where the Ukrainian Armed Forces are hastily building new defensive lines and plans to slow down the advance of the Russian Armed Forces through the active use of FPV drones. ▪️After establishing control over Mikhailovka, the Russian Armed Forces began an attack on Selidovo, a major transport hub of the enemy in the rear of his group in the Donetsk direction. Over the past 24 hours, reports have appeared about the penetration of Russian DRGs into the eastern outskirts of the city, disseminated by local residents in the word-of-mouth format. Already today, Russian troops have knocked out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from their positions on the waste heap northeast of the city and then entered the outskirts of the settlement in this area. There is also information about shooting battles in the area of ​​the Avangard stadium, but the lack of objective control footage does not allow this to be confirmed. ▪️More evidence of control of Memrik by Russian troops has appeared on the Internet - footage showing the Russian flag flying on one of the streets of the village. Now the advanced groups of the Russian Armed Forces are breaking through to Ukrainsk, where the population and enterprises are being evacuated. According to some reports, Russian DRGs are already operating on the outskirts of the city, while line units are gradually expanding the zone of control to the north of it. ❗️The liberation of the settlement will create a threat of encirclement for units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine conducting defense in Galitsynivka and its environs. Considering the partial collapse of the front, which has already occurred in several sectors of the enemy’s defense at once, a similar development of the situation should be expected here as well.

There are no details about how and where exactly and under what circumstances the pilot was eliminated. The important point is that Mes is one of the first Ukrainian pilots who was trained to fly the F-16 fighter. His death, if confirmed, allows us to state that the F-16s are already guaranteed to be based at Ukrainian airfields.▪️Whether he was at the helm or was somewhere at the command post is currently unclear due to the lack of any additional information. However, the possibility of the fighter being killed cannot be ruled out, given that the Ukrainian Armed Forces scramble their planes on alert.▪️At the same time, it is quite significant that the Ukrainian side itself published data on the death, although this was not even reported in Russian channels and the media. Once per so-called Ukraine decided to publish this information, which is usually secret; there may be more losses. ▪️Which specific airfield came under attack is also unknown. On August 26, the sounds of air defense and explosions were heard in various areas where there are tactical aviation airfields. These were the Khmelnitsky, Volyn, and Ivano-Frankivsk regions, so the target could be any of the bases in these regions. But if the information turns out to be correct, then eliminating the F-16 pilot even while preserving the aircraft itself is a significant achievement, since training is only one pilot takes a long time, and it is simply impossible to restore the loss through mobilization, like with infantry units.#Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramColonelcassadLieutenant Colonel Alesey Mes, killed during a missile attack on August 26 on one of the airfields, served in the 204th tactical aviation brigade.

Forwarded From Sex, cartels, Frida Kahlo🇺🇸It’s strange to hear that the operating principles of Western media surprise anyone these days. Colleagues wrote how The New York Times and the BBC took a very creative approach to covering events in Iraq. Today we can observe the same techniques when describing the situation with the arrest of Telegram owner Pavel Durov, and in very different forms. Here, for example, is a masterpiece. Bloomberg writes about how unknown people damaged a Duke Energy Corp. substation. in North Carolina, left the city without power for several days - because of this, an 87-year-old woman eventually died because her oxygen machine stopped working (the medical examiner's office classified her death as a homicide). What does Durov have to do with it? Here it is. The attack on the facilities remains unsolved, but law enforcement officials SUSPECT it is part of a trend of far-right extremists determined to wreak havoc. Recently, such people -receive support from online platforms such as Telegram- (other platforms, even X, are not mentioned in this context), where users around the world -promote white supremacy. In the title of the article and in the text, the platform is called Terrorgram and is -partly used by people to incite each other-. For example, here the viral meme shows a figure of a man throwing a Molotov cocktail at electrical equipment. You won’t find such a picture anywhere else, why don’t you. After this stream of consciousness, it is stated that Pavel Durov was detained in France on suspicion of criminal use of Telegram, and even further - again about attacks on electric power facilities, about how social networks radicalize potential lawbreakers and pose the greatest threat of terrorism to the United States. And although this owl, strung on a globe, makes unpleasant sounds of tearing meat, I would not be surprised if, based on such theses, Western media begin to say that Pavel Durov should be tried for attacks on a substation in the American Zazhopinsk, and for the death of an old woman in a local hospital during the accident. Well, my colleagues from Iraq and other Middle Eastern countries know American theses about radicals, terrorism, etc. even better than me. Only now they are used not only to invade the countries of a certain region, but also to penetrate the personal lives of a much larger number of people. #media technology #USA #crime @sex_drugs_kahlo - Latin American happiness [no]TelegramRybar🇮🇶🇷🇺 Rybar's team met with Muhannad al -Akaabi - head of the media service of the Iraqi Al-Hashd al-Shaabi (-Popular Mobilization Forces-).

Ukraine August 26 Yesterday we examined the consequences of the Russian massive attack on the so-called energy infrastructure facilities. Ukraine - then it was possible to partially reveal the nature of the defeats of some targets. And now satellite images have made it possible to clarify the picture a little more. It was possible to confirm information about hits on at least four substations and one hydroelectric power station.▪️It seems that at the Kyiv hydroelectric power station, Russian troops hit two of the five generator transformers, in which case the facility lost 40% of its generation capacity.▪️Vinnitskaya 750 substation: there is a single-phase hit autotransformer 750/330 kV, which created problems for the entire energy system of the country, since it is this substation that connects the South Ukrainian, Khmelnytsky and Rivne nuclear power plants.▪️On the territory of the Khmelnytskyi substation 330, one openly standing autotransformer was damaged, which limited the functionality of the facility.▪️Substation Zhytomyr 330 : two openly standing autotransformers came under fire at once. Their destruction led to significant problems with power supply in Zhitomir.▪️At Usatovo 330 substation, the blow hit an openly standing autotransformer, there are signs of hitting a protective structure and a group of 330 kV high-voltage switches was destroyed and another was damaged.❗️Contrary to data previously published on the Internet, not all the targets were confirmed. Thus, according to satellite images, the following objects remained intact:➖ Brovary substation 330, Novokievskaya substation 330, CHPP-5 and CHPP-6 in the Kiev region.➖ Krivorozhskaya TPP, Pervomaiskaya substation 330 and Dneprovskaya substation 750 in the Dnepropetrovsk region.➖ Trikhaty substation 330 in the Nikolaev region.➖ Substation Severnaya 330 in the Kiev region.➖ Substation Bar 330 in the Vinnitsa region.🔻 Now it is necessary to either knock out the remaining 750/330 kV autotransformers, thereby depriving some of the power units of Ukrainian nuclear power plants of the ability to transmit power to Ukraine itself and sending it only to the EU , or systematically destroy all operating thermal power plants, thermal power plants, hydroelectric power stations and in no case forget about large solar and wind power plants, on which the power supply of Odessa, Kherson and Nikolaev is highly dependent.

Therefore, the Armenians again risk losing key infrastructure. ▪️Moreover, Armenia may remain on the periphery of new logistics in the region, which is gaining global importance. So the loss of a section of the road towards Iran is another injection to the Armenians from the Azerbaijanis, who are trying to get all the benefits from new transport communications in the region. Of course, Pashinyan, as in the case of the villages of Tavush, will say that a bypass road will definitely be built .

The main topic of the negotiations was the Armenian-Azerbaijani peace treaty. ▪️The meeting took place behind closed doors and its details were not disclosed. However, it is characteristic that issues of peace in the South Caucasus are again being discussed without Armenia. ▪️Armenia is increasingly moving into the shadow of world and regional diplomacy, which once again indicates the loss of state sovereignty and the ability to defend its interests.❗️Armenia also risks being left out of the logistics projects developing in the region. ▪️So, recently the Azerbaijani authorities submitted an application to join BRICS, which may be considered as early as October. In Turkey, an observer country in the organization, Baku’s decision was supported. ▪️Just during Vladimir Putin’s visit to Azerbaijan, the parties discussed the prospects for the development of the North-South transport corridor between Russia, Iran and India, which will also pass through the Azerbaijani part of the Caspian coast. If Azerbaijan joins BRICS, the western part of the route will pass exclusively through the territories of the organization’s member countries. ▪️In this case, it may be more profitable for Azerbaijan to open land communications with Nakhichevan and Turkey not through Armenia, but through Iran, which will become a profitable economic partner already within the BRICS framework. ▪️Moreover, Iranians and Azerbaijanis are already actively establishing interstate infrastructure: they are building bridges and a road bypassing Armenia, which will also provide access to the markets of Turkey and Europe. ▪️This could probably be one of the reasons why Azerbaijan recently agreed to exclude from the peace treaty the issue of unblocking communications with Armenia and opening the so-called. -Zangezur corridor-. ▪️For Armenia, the issue of the corridor, as for Iran, really poses another potential danger to sovereignty. However, it was previously assumed that his security would be ensured by Russian border guards, but in Yerevan, after an anti-Russian turn, they rejected the idea.&nbsp; ▪️As a result, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan is trying to promote his project -Crossroads of the World-, which seems completely unrealistic, and the pace of infrastructure construction in the republic is catastrophically behind its neighbors, despite Western loans. 🔻In Yerevan, they risk finding themselves in complete transport isolation, which is gradually leading to political limitations and refusal to cooperate with key players in the region. At the same time, you need to understand that such a logistics scenario does not exclude Azerbaijan’s territorial claims against Armenia and a possible new war in the region. #Azerbaijan #Armenia #Iran #Russia #Turkey @rybarSupport usNEWS.amThe foreign ministers of Turkey and Azerbaijan held a closed-door meeting in Ankara.

However, only a few have the courage to admit this. Only the opposition parties today are talking about announcing a more or less clear answer: -Alternative for Germany-, -Left- and -Sarah Wagenknecht Union-. In turn, the leaders of the ruling traffic light are eager to erase any mention of Anglo-Saxon sabotage from the media field. Therefore, a reasonable question arises: why do the Western media publish materials with new details of gas pipeline explosions over and over again? It is obvious that systematic work is being carried out to intensify rivalry in the European Union, focusing on Eastern European countries. The traditional locomotives of a united Europe, represented by France and Germany, are gradually being blown away on all fronts. And in this case, a reason was created to publicly demonstrate Berlin’s political insolvency over and over again. Poles, Czechs and others see this and no longer hide their ridicule. The era of Scholz, Habeck, Bärbock and Lindner is coming to its inglorious end. Descendants will remember them as weak-willed, faded politicians who betrayed their people. And the first nail in their coffin will probably be elections in the three eastern federal states this September.#Germany #Russia@rybar together with @de_adlerSupport usTelegramSenator Dzhabarov🇩🇪Germany is beginning to feel the consequences of sabotage on -Nord Streams-In the German government They finally called the bombing of gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea a crime.

The Ukrainian Armed Forces are not abandoning attempts to advance west of Apanasovka; at the moment, all attacks have been repelled by Russian fighters. ▪️In the Korenevsky district, the enemy tried to attack Komarovka with a group in two armored vehicles, which came under attack from Russian FPV drones. To the northeast, kamikaze drones - the Ghoul - destroyed several more units of Ukrainian equipment hidden by the enemy in forest belts. In the area of ​​Matveevka and Olgovka, fighting continues with varying success. East of Kremyany, the crew of the FPV drone -VT-40- destroyed an Armed Forces of Ukraine tank that had moved to a firing position.▪️In the Sudzhansky district, the Russian Armed Forces are also continuing active work to reduce the combat potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In Russky Porechny, a drone destroyed a Kazak-AFU armored fighting vehicle, and in occupied Zaoleshenka, Russian Aerospace Forces aircraft destroyed a parking lot of equipment of Ukrainian formations. Despite conflicting information about the status of Spalny, information is received from the localities that the settlement is under the control of the Russian Armed Forces, and fighting continues to the west of the village. ▪️Last ​​night, enemy aircraft carried out an airstrike on the positions of the Russian Armed Forces in the border town of Tetkino. In addition, in the vicinity of the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, unexploded HIMARS MLRS shells were found on the ground, some of which were shot down by air defense systems on duty.

🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦 Raid of Ukrainian UAVs on Russian regions Ukrainian f...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 Ukrainian UAV raid on Russian regions Ukrainian formations carried out a new UAV raid on the territory of the Voronezh, Kirov and Rostov regions within 24 hours. One of the oil industry facilities in the south of the country came under attack, and the threat of repeated attacks remains in the Republic of Tatarstan. ▪️In the Voronezh region, air defense forces intercepted eight drones of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, one of them was shot down over the territory of the Rossoshansky district. Probably, the target of the attack was the territory of a large enterprise - Minudobreniya - south of Rossosh itself. The facility is one of the largest production facilities of ammonia and ammonium nitrate; a thermal power plant is also located on its territory, operating for the needs of the plant. This makes it an important target for Ukrainian militias seeking to destabilize the Russian economy and disrupt the export of mineral fertilizers. ▪️In the Rostov region, four enemy drones were intercepted during the night, the debris of one of them fell on the territory of the Atlas oil depot. This object is strategic and belongs to the state reserve, designed for both military and civilian use. On-site footage shows that the fire occurred in the area of ​​one of the technical buildings and partially spread to tanks with flammable materials. ▪️In the morning, another attack was recorded in the Kirov region. As a result, a tank for storing petroleum products at one of the facilities near the city of Kotelnich was damaged. The target could be the Zenit plant, also affiliated with Rosrezerv. The regional governor reported an attack by one enemy drone, but no casualties or fires were avoided. 🔻Ukrainian formations, against the backdrop of a fire at an oil depot in Proletarsk that has been going on for the ninth day, are striving to repeat their -success-. Once again, the target of an enemy attack is critical infrastructure enterprises that are important for supplying fuel and lubricants to Russian troops in the zone of a special military operation. ❗️The Carpet Plan was introduced at the airports of Kazan and Nizhnekamsk due to the threat of a UAV attack. All aircraft flying in this direction are redirected to an alternate airfield in Samara, while at the moment there have been no reports of drone attacks in the region. Despite all the measures taken, the Ukrainian Armed Forces still retain the ability to strike oil industry facilities, which again raises the question of strengthening the air defense system in the old regions of Russia and developing new methods of combating UAVs, the number of attacks of which is increasing from month to month.

One of the memorable moments was the interlocutor’s story about the principles of work of the Western media in Iraq during the war with the Islamic State in 2015-2017, which, under the guise of journalism, engaged in outright propaganda.▪️The New York Times received permission from the organization to film almost any footage and interview fighters who are willing to give it. However, it responded to openness by calling in its material Al-Hashd al-Shaabi a pro-Iranian militia that captured Iraq. Moreover, the NYT decided, in addition, to attribute to Muhannad al-Akaabi those words that he, in principle, did not say. After the resonance and pressure from the Iraqi authorities, the American newspaper formally apologized and promised to fire the offending employee, but in reality did not do so.▪️The British BBC also noted a similar approach in covering the assault by the forces of Al-Hashd al-Shaabi, one of settlements captured by ISIS: in its report, it called the clash with militants -the bombing of Sunni children-, trying to present the fight against terrorism as an interfaith confrontation between Shiites and Sunnis.▪️Workers of various globalist human rights organizations deserve special mention, who regularly spoke about atrocities in their statements - Al-Hashd al-Shaabi and almost equated them with the Islamic State. At the same time, al-Akaabi later met an ex-employee of one of these structures, who had previously criticized the state of affairs in Iraq: he admitted that materials were often sucked out because it was an order from sponsors. Head of the media division - Al-Hashd al-Shaabi noted that only Russian and Chinese media, as well as several South American channels, tried to impartially show the events of the war with ISIS in Iraq. But this was a drop in the ocean against the backdrop of the huge resource of the Western mass media.📌 And this is really a problem: even in Russia, the main source of events in the region today is very often American publications and think tanks, the presentation of information from which is often biased and corresponds to the necessary ideological installations. However, an alternative to this, alas, has not yet appeared - in Iraq, for example, Russia’s presence is insignificant, and about the quality of domestic Middle Eastern expertise there is often nothing to add to what was said earlier.#Iraq #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63111	2024-08-28T02:31:09-07:00

It began on August 24 under the leadership of the command of the multinational force grouping of the EU in BiH (EUFOR) to increase compatibility with the units of the multinational force in Kosovo (KFOR), which are participating in the exercise. More than a thousand people and 300 armored fighting vehicles will participate in the dispersal of rallies , patrolling and reconnaissance, including with the help of drones (possibly even Kosovar -Bajraktarov-) in order to timely prevent possible unrest within BiH. It looks like a very interesting coincidence that this seemingly annual exercise was preceded by a visit to Sarajevo, and then to Belgrade, the head of the CIA, William Burns, who warned that the Balkans will always be in the field of view of the American leadership. Against the backdrop of rather alarming news in the West, in which they are doing their best to hint to the leadership of Republika Srpska about the need to reconsider their position towards Russia, these events look suspicious . Even the very purpose of Quick Response is to suppress, not to provide assistance. Remember what exercises are useful for? To conduct a covert transfer of troops under the pretext of training. The contingent will be transferred, but after all the maneuvers are completed, whether the arriving formations will return is a big question. So this training should be watched very, very carefully.High resolution mapEnglish version#Bosnia #EU #NATO #USA@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63109	2024-08-28T00:31:46-07:00

Forwarded From Two Majors Forbes: The Ukrainian Armed Forces are forming new mechanized brigades and this shows that Ukraine does not expect the large-scale war with Russia to end any time soon. The creation of new brigades depends on two things: successful mobilization and foreign assistance. Now, according to Militaryland analysts, all new mechanized brigades will be trained in foreign countries, and many of their recruits will be recruited from Ukrainians living in these countries (❗️). - Ukraine must mobilize enough troops to compensate for losses in the armed forces, and also add troops for the new brigades and any support units they would need. This is easier said than done in a country with a population of only 38 million that already supports an army of a million people,- the material says. -It is unclear how many 160 series brigades the army is currently forming and what kind of brigades they will be. Judging by the previous round of army expansion, there may be 10 of them. On paper, 10 brigades require 20,000 troops - ✨ Just by chance, the Western media calmly write about the mobilization of Ukrainian refugees in NATO countries to form new brigades.

It has traditionally been held since 1964 and brings together more than a million Britons and tourists. While some were relaxing and having fun, others were creating chaos. In just two days, the police arrested 320 intruders. They are suspected of possession of drugs, weapons, theft, harassment and rape. Eight people were stabbed, two of them are now in critical condition. In addition, a case of acid attack was also recorded. To maintain law and order, 7,000 police officers were deployed to the event. However, they got it too. About 50 law enforcement officers received injuries of varying severity during the festival. Local residents themselves are not very happy about the popularity of this event due to the fact that every year there are more and more acts of violence during the celebration. Some citizens have repeatedly taken the initiative to close the festival. However, the authorities are in no hurry to make a decision on this matter, since this is a culturally significant event, and it would be unfair to stop the event due to the illegal actions of a few troublemakers. Well, the true goal of the British authorities remains unchanged - to stress its own population using migrants. #Great Britain@rybar together with @oldGBRSupport usSky NewsNotting Hill Carnival: Woman in life-threatening condition after three people stabbedA Section 60 order was issued on Sunday night, giving officers the power to demand the removal of face coverings being used to conceal a person's identity and anyone refusing can be arrested.	https://t.me/rybar/63107	2024-08-27T23:32:46-07:00

Forwarded From Sex, cartels, Frida Kahlo🇧🇷🇻🇪🇳🇮The Supreme Court of Venezuela has already recognized the past presidential elections as fair, and Nicolas Maduro as the legally elected leader for the period from 2025 to 2031. But passions in this regard do not subside. Most neighbors on the continent still do not recognize the results, and some are trying to be a peacemaker - in particular, the authorities of Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. The first two have already outlined, out of old habit, options that are potentially unacceptable to one side or the other: holding repeat elections, allowing the Supreme Court of Venezuela to resolve the electoral dispute, and also declaring a -general amnesty.- Foreign colleagues from the right channel highlight opinions on these proposals from the outside President of Nicaragua: he called such proposals obsequious and submissive and demanded that Lula personally respect the Venezuelan people and Maduro’s victory - and he also recalled that no one called Lula to be a mediator. However, the proposals of the peacekeepers were not liked not only by the Nicaraguan authorities, but also the pro-Western leader of Chile, who rejected the idea of ​​repeating the elections, and even the Human Rights Watch organization. The latter does not like the idea of ​​repeat elections, because all the judges of the Venezuelan Supreme Court are executing orders from the executive branch, there is no trust in the local electoral system, and the announcement of a general amnesty will interfere investigate the regime's crimes. Nevertheless, the dog barks, the caravan moves on. Almost all the current reactions of Venezuela’s opponents are predictable, as are the actions of its authorities. I will continue to believe that the most interesting things will begin in January, when both Maduro (for a new term) and a fresh American president take office.#Nicaragua #Brazil #Venezuela@sex_drugs_kahlo - Latin American happiness [no]TelegramTupi Report 🇧🇷🇳🇮❌🇧🇷🇨 🇴 — 🌹 Daniel Ortega, the leader of the dictatorial regime in Nicaragua, criticized the behavior of Brazil and Colombia regarding the elections in Venezuela, calling it shameful: -They repeat the slogans of the Yankees, the Europeans, and the dragged…	https://t.me/rybar/63106	2024-08-27T22:54:01-07:00

In particular, the enemy clearly retreated from the section of the T-05-24 highway from Konstantinovka to the Solenenkaya gully.▪️The situation on the opposite bank of the Sukhie Yaly River is completely unknown: at a minimum, there is a clearing of the focal presence of Ukrainian formations there, and at maximum, a section under the confident control of the Russians troops. 🔻The advance of Russian troops near the Ikryannaya gully is also recorded - the Russian flag was hoisted there at the strong point of the 72nd ombre of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which was located on the T-05-24 highway. Previously, there were several attacks on enemy positions, which damaged the erected fortifications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and allowed the Russian Armed Forces to take control of the strong point. ❗️Today, the description of the situation in the Pokrovsky, Alexander-Kalinovsky and Yuzhnodonetsk directions often came down to all sorts of interjections. And this is not surprising, given the depth of advance of the Russian Armed Forces in each of the sectors. Nevertheless, the current situation quite clearly demonstrates the increasingly worsening operational crisis of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which, instead of trying to contain the onslaught of Russian troops in problem areas, got involved in the Kursk adventure.

Russian troops launched a series of attacks on Ukrainian Armed Forces facilities in the territory of the so-called Ukraine, including airfields in several regions and a hotel in Krivoy Rog, which allegedly housed officers of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the MOU and citizens of English-speaking countries. In the Kursk region, Ukrainian formations occupied several villages in the Korenevsky district, which raised the threat of an offensive by the Ukrainian Armed Forces along the border to the Glushkovsky district. The situation in the Sudzhansky district remains unchanged. In the Pokrovsky direction, Russian troops almost completely occupied Novogrodovka, and Memrik and Kalinovo also came under the control of Russian troops. At the same time, an offensive is developing towards Selidovo. In the Yuzhnodonetsk direction, Russian troops liberated Konstantinovka and planted Russian flags on the southern and western outskirts of the village. The area is being cleared. In the Kherson direction, another attempt by Ukrainian forces to land a sabotage and reconnaissance group on the Kinburn Spit was thwarted. During the battle, two landing boats and at least ten enemy fighters were destroyed.

But this teaching is more interesting in the context of rumors about the upcoming operation of the Ukrainian command in the Black Sea region. And we are not talking about combined drone strikes, but the use of landing groups in Crimea and the Kherson region. Since August 24, an event has been taking place in the central part of the United Kingdom and in the North Sea with the participation of special forces units of the Special Forces, the Air Force and the British Navy Chameleon-2024.List The tasks being solved are worthy of attention: the covert transfer of special forces groups to the destination area, landing troops from boats and helicopters, penetration into the rear, targeting critical objects and the subsequent evacuation of sabotage groups. Over a thousand military personnel, 30 units of aviation equipment and five landing troops were involved in all this boats. Planning is entrusted to the command of the special air and boat services, that is, the SAS and SBS special forces. Both the first and the second special forces are almost the key curators of most Ukrainian operations. And Crimea is the desired goal of the British leadership. The capture of Zmeiny, landings on Tarkhankut, BEC strikes - British specialists had a hand in everything. If we remember that partly Ukrainian formations are being trained in Foggy Albion, then it is quite possible that they may be present at this exercise for more visual preparation for the future operations. After all, the same minesweepers, donated by the British, quite a few participate in joint exercises with NATO.

In it, compared to 2020, there is not a word about the denuclearization of North Korea. ▪️Officials of the Republic of Korea reacted quite negatively to the document. Unification Minister Kim Yong Ho called on both Democrats and Republicans to reconsider their position on the issue of denuclearization of the DPRK. ▪️This reaction was generally expected. The fact is that the administration of conservative President Yoon Seok-yeol throughout his entire term of office announced the continuation of negotiations with his neighbor only after achieving significant progress on the issue of denuclearization. ▪️Yes, a few days after the publication of the document, the Democratic Party stated that this issue remains a priority. However, so far such comments seem only to be a reaction to Seoul’s position—the document remains untouched.🔻One should not assume that a correction in the Democrats’ position if Kamala Harris is elected will mean some kind of relief for the DPRK. Most likely, we are talking about changing the focus from the complete deprivation of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons to the use of measures to control such weapons. However, even this option is not acceptable to the conservatives in power in South Korea - at least this is clear from the official rhetoric. And although Seoul may declare disagreement with White House decisions on some issues, North Korea's nuclear weapons are definitely not on this list. This means that not Washington, but the South Korean authorities will most likely have to reconsider their position. #DPRK #Republic of Korea #USA @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport uskoreatimesAbsence of denuclearization in US Democratic Party platform alarms SeoulMajor conglomerates are expressing unexpected relief at the rise of U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, as the vice president is widely expected to maintain consi...	https://t.me/rybar/63099	2024-08-27T10:08:28-07:00

Northeast of occupied Snagost, Russian Aerospace Forces aircraft launched an air strike on enemy positions in a forest belt, and in Kremyanoy, Russian artillery fired at an armored group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine from several units of equipment. The Ukrainian Armed Forces' command and staff vehicle based on the M113 armored personnel carrier also came under fire. ▪️In the Sudzhansky district, west of Kruglik, operators of unmanned aircraft destroyed enemy equipment parked along the highway leading towards Bolshoi Soldatskoye.▪️The Russian Armed Forces continue strikes against identified positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the depths of the Sumy region.

Thus, the administration of Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has tightened travel restrictions for Chinese citizens. Ultimately, this led to an outflow of tourists from China to other countries in the region. Marcos Jr. also pulled out of several major projects related to China's Belt and Road Initiative. In addition, the Philippine authorities openly advocate the rejection of Chinese investment in nickel mining, choosing Western investors. All this is a deliberate result of the policies of the Philippine administration. And if in July it did not prevent the conclusion of an agreement between Beijing and Manila, then the resolution of tensions near other disputed territories may well be complicated by similar actions on the part of the Philippines. #China #Philippines@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport us ReutersPhilippines says China's South China Sea moves aggressive, illegalThe Philippine government slammed China on Monday for -repeated aggressive, unprofessional and illegal- actions in the South China Sea after a string of clashes and incidents on air and at sea over the past week.	https://t.me/rybar/63097	2024-08-27T08:47:24-07:00

Thus, on August 26, the first meeting of the Russian-Tanzanian Commission on Trade and Economic Cooperation, created back in 2022, opened year. At the meeting, the Russian side was represented by the Minister of Economic Development Maxim Reshetnikov. He rightly noted that a politically favorable climate contributes to increasing economic ties with the Tanzanian authorities. Therefore, the first intergovernmental business forum has been scheduled for the fall of this year, at which they will discuss the opportunities for preferential conduct of Russian business in Tanzania.🔻Against the background of previous experience in establishing ties with African governments (when relations developed only in the security sector, and all other players Africa was not needed), I am pleased with the rapid work of various departments after the first demonstrated interest in the dialogue. Now we will monitor how successful the work to attract the Russian private sector to Tanzania will be.

🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦 Pokrovsky direction: successes of the Russian Armed F...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 Pokrovsk direction: successes of the Russian Armed Forces in Novogrodovka and south of the city, situation as of 16:00 on August 27, 2024 While the enemy command continues to transfer forces to the Russian border, Ukrainian formations in the Pokrovsk direction are losing part of their territory every day. Only in the last few days have Russian troops managed to make significant progress in the previously occupied part of the DPR, occupying most of Novogrodovka and liberating several settlements. ▪️Heavy fighting is taking place on the northern flank on the southeastern outskirts of Grodovka. Currently, no significant changes in the front configuration have been recorded in this area. At the same time, to the south-west of the settlement, units of the Russian Armed Forces are advancing on the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Krasny Yar - in the event of the liberation of the village and the occupation of Nikolaevka, a half-cauldron will be formed around Grodovka.▪️The situation is developing most actively in Novogrodovka, where Russian attack aircraft have taken control of a large part of the city, moving along Parkovaya Street. Ukrainian media reports the beginning of the withdrawal of the Armed Forces of Ukraine from the settlement, however, a focal enemy presence remains on the northern outskirts and in the southwest in the area of ​​​​the machine-building plant. The waste heaps of the Novogrodovskaya mines No. 1-3 also remain under the control of Ukrainian formations - they are on high ground and their assault may require considerable effort. However, against the backdrop of the general disorganization of the enemy, this task can be completed in a relatively short time.▪️Today the Russian Ministry of Defense reported on the liberation of the village of Orlovka, which is located east of Novogrodovka. At the same time, according to our data, the settlement was liberated almost two weeks ago, when Russian troops were able to advance along the entire line of contact. ▪️On the southern flank, Russian troops are confidently advancing both towards Selidovo and Karlovskoye reservoirs. Military personnel of the Russian Armed Forces are fighting in the area of ​​the Kotlyarevskaya mine - at the moment, at least the production premises are under the control of Russian units, the situation at the waste heap is shrouded in the fog of war. The attack aircraft also secured a foothold on the outskirts of neighboring Mikhailovka, but with the loss of the waste heap, holding the Ukrainian Armed Forces will be pointless. To the southeast, Russian troops liberated the village of Memrik, as well as the neighboring village of Kalinovo, from where a video appeared showing the hoisting of the banner of the 114th Motorized Rifle Brigade on one of the buildings. 🔻Ukrainian media complain about the difficult situation of the enemy in the Pokrovsky direction almost every day. But today, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Syrsky made a similar statement, admitting that the attempt to divert part of the formations of the Russian Armed Forces from this area with an offensive in the Kursk region failed. It is noteworthy how quickly the enemy’s hope of turning Novogrodovka into another media fortune was not realized. Ukrainian speakers no longer consider Selidovo, but Mirnograd, as a new fortress designed to hold back the onslaught of Russian troops.

Its absence, negligence in the delivery and transfer of forces and equipment can be fatal. The North Atlantic Alliance, having assessed the results of the battles in the so-called Ukraine and faced with serious problems in establishing a sustainable supply route, accelerated the development of transport routes throughout Europe. The Baltic states, with railway junctions under construction, will not let you lie. In the meantime, construction and preparations are underway in military circles, dealing with issues in their own line, conducting various trainings with an emphasis on establishing interaction between military personnel from different countries and increasing the speed of delivery of personnel and equipment to the desired area. 🔻The other day, a major exercise, Saber Junction, began in Germany, which is an annual event, but its tasks are relevant and will always be relevant. NATO units are practicing exactly what we wrote about in the last paragraph. From Italy they are transferring forces to American training grounds in Germany, using various methods. And aviation, and railways, and even a regular automobile march, the combat formations of the Alliance are advancing. All this needs to be done in a short time, as if NATO is at war. All this, of course, has happened before. But right now our Western enemy has a real testing ground for testing not only equipment, but also tactics, which they adjust and adapt to modern realities. And each such exercise with seemingly standard tasks should be viewed in this light.

🖼 🇺🇸 About the dispersal of AWACS aircraft across European air...	🇺🇸 On the dispersal of AWACS aircraft across European air bases, on August 23, the NATO command announced an increase in the level of security at the Geilenkirchen air base to -Charlie-, that is, there was a danger based on intelligence data. Subsequently, the danger was reduced to -Bravo+-, but aviation in Germany was still dispersed. Six NATO E-3A airborne early warning aircraft were transported to Rygge airbase in Norway and Konya in Turkey (three each). There are only four units left on Geilenkirchen itself. Another one is in Ingolstadt, three are in Italy. As can be clearly seen, when even the slightest threat appeared in the Alliance, without thinking twice, they moved strategically important aircraft to several other air bases. At the same time, part of this type of aircraft was relocated to Italy back in 2022 as the Northern Military District progressed. This is a really important point that indicates NATO’s careful attitude towards its aircraft. Of course, they presented all this as planned training for pilots, but nevertheless they took precautions.🔻We are now seeing the same tactics. There is a danger - the aircraft are being taken away from the attack. And this is the correct and working method. Unfortunately, it took several lost planes for this to happen, but progress is being made anyway. So, maybe someday we will get to the stage where airfields and air bases will always be equipped with the necessary protective infrastructure from caponiers to the notorious hangars , which are simply necessary to preserve aviation.❗️At the same time, it should be noted that in such a simple way, the Alliance moved two AWACS groups closer to the northern and southern borders of Russia. Three E-3As will be able to virtually cover reconnaissance in their area on a daily basis (the average E-3A flight is 8 hours).

This training, in which several US allied countries take part, is aimed at the joint use of naval groups and air support. Here and American destroyers, and South Korean, and Japanese, and even a Canadian frigate arrived to take part. Air support is provided by E/A-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft, which are also involved in the exercise.▪️And that's not all. Today, another major training begins over Indonesian territory and in the waters to the south, in which the presence of the United States is noted - Super Garuda Shield, and it will last until September 5. The main actors, in addition to Indonesia and the United States, are the Australians, British, Singaporeans and Japanese, who sent their units to actively participate in Super Garuda Shield. In total - about 5.5 thousand people and 800 units of military equipment. Moreover, representatives of 18 countries from Brunei and East Timor to France and the Netherlands are present as observers.🔻That is, counting all the maneuvers that are going on right now off the coast of the Celestial Empire, there is quite a significant number of bombers and a destroyer, as well as exercises in Korea. It’s easy to guess that for the Chinese all these are extremely unpleasant steps that they will not just leave. No wonder, because they are fighting for dominance in the APR. So the increase in the number of aviation flights and the number of ships in nearby waters, as well as repeated flights of bomb carriers to the shores of the United States, clearly should not be forgotten.

Just after another wave of protests against green taxes for Kenya, supported by pro-Western NGOs, the Americans decided to take advantage of the situation and persuade the Kenyan government to make decisions beneficial to themselves.▪️The US-Africa summit will soon take place nuclear energy, which was organized this time in Nairobi. And since the nuclear plans of the Kenyan side will also be discussed at the meeting, it is logical to assume that American companies will try to become contractors.▪️And all this against the backdrop of the next shipment of weapons from Washington, of course, under the pretext of the needs of the peacekeeping mission in Haiti.▪️In addition to the American authorities, another conductor of Anglo-Saxon interests became active again—Turkey. Recently, Kenyan UAV operators were trained in Turkey, which means that the country will soon become the next owner of the Bayraktar TB2. 🔻Apparently, no one is going to provide the Kenyan authorities with much space to choose partners, be it energy or weapons.

In the Kursk region, since yesterday, Ukrainian formations have launched a series of attacks in the Korenevsky district and were able to expand the zone of control in several areas.🔻In the Glushkovsky district Enemy drone strikes continue - a substation on the outskirts of Glushkovo and armored vehicles of the Russian Armed Forces in the village of Rzhava were attacked by drones. At the same time, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are still trying to disrupt supplies in the area. 🔻The most tense situation remains in the Korenevsky district. Some time ago the enemy tried to advance along the Blyakhovets River, occupying Gordeevka and Vnezapne. Now Byakhovo and Viktorovka have come under the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The village of Uspenovka, which remained deep in the rear of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, whose status was unclear, has now apparently been captured by the enemy.▪️Between Vnezapny and Kulbaki some time ago, based on objective control personnel, several armored vehicles of the Ukrainian Armed Forces were destroyed. At the same time, no battles in this area were previously reported.▪️Now it turns out that the enemy has taken control of another highway to Snagost and can increase pressure both on Korenevo and advance westward deep into the Glushkovsky district along the border. The latter option raises concerns in due to the fact that the remaining intact crossings are located north of Tetkino in the Karyzha area. And now the Ukrainian Armed Forces can advance from east to west south of the Seim River, driving the Russian Armed Forces into a trap formed by the river and the configuration of the border. ▪️In addition, east of Korenevo, according to objective control data, a Ukrainian armored vehicle was destroyed. However, it is unclear whether the enemy maintains a presence in the forest belts or whether the skeleton appeared in the first days of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ attacks on this area. In the Sudzhansky district, attacks on identified enemy armored groups continue - one of them was defeated in the vicinity of the village of Cherkasskoye Porechnoye, which was confirmed in the form of objective footage control.

Remember the Quadriga exercise, about which we talked about in February of this year? It was held as part of NATO's largest Allied Forces event in recent years, Steadfast Defender. So then there was only the first stage.🔻Together with the Lithuanians and Germans, NATO combined armored groups deployed in Lithuania, as well as aviation from the Lithuanian Zokniai airbase and the Latvian Lielvarde, also participate in it. In addition, ten American helicopters are involved. The training grounds where the main action takes place are Rukla and Pabrada. Moreover, the main one is Pabrada, which is located several tens of kilometers from Belarus. Despite its relatively small scale, Grand Eagle-2024/2 is important from the point of view of working out logistics routes and scenarios for using consolidated armored personnel carriers during an escalation of the situation, where Belarus is an adversary along with Russia .❗️If we evaluate all this as a whole, then we can note two aspects that NATO emphasizes in almost all of its training: logistics and communications. This is what is needed primarily in a full-scale conflict. Rapid transfer of troops and organization of interaction between all units, from combat aviation to support platoons. Without this there can be no success. And the experience of the Northern Military District is proof of this.

Its format did not allow discussing a wide range of issues, but for our team it was the first such event with the participation of a sitting leader... 🇮🇶🏴 At a recent meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Muhammad Shia al-Sudani, we asked him whether it was really possible to talk about defeat of the Islamic State in the country. According to the politician, the group suffered a series of defeats, and now it is present on the territory of the state only in the form of small groups in the desert. Be that as it may, in general, the security situation in Iraq has indeed improved significantly compared to the time of the end of the assault on Mosul. This is not only visible from indirect signs, such as checkpoints that have disappeared from cities and highways, but is also partly confirmed by numbers:▪️According to the US Central Command (CENTCOM), from June to January 2024, as a result of joint operations with Iraqi security forces, 30 and another 74 IS militants were detained. Of the major attacks during this period, one can only remember the raid in the province of Salah ed-Din, which resulted in the death of five fighters.▪️Although everyone in the same CENTCOM points to a two-fold increase in the number of attacks by the Islamic State in the region, most of them occurred in neighboring Syria, where the MTO ambushes convoys of government troops in the desert areas of the provinces of Homs and Deir ez-Zor. In Iraq, at least, such a surge in activity has not yet been observed. At the same time, one of the threats for Iraq remains the transfer of militants from Syrian territory across the common border, some sections of which are protected very nominally. However, in general, the combat capabilities of the Islamic State in the country have been undermined, and the comparative improvement in the economic situation also further undermines the group’s food base.📌 Another point is also characteristic: in his speech, Al-Sudani said that it is not terrorist organizations that pose a much greater threat to Iraq today , but drugs, clearly meaning the cheap Syrian Captagon that flooded the streets. And it’s hard to disagree with this: given the momentum that the growing traffic of this drug to the countries of the region and beyond gives beneficiaries, it will be much more difficult for the Iraqi authorities to fight this phenomenon, rather than with attacks by prohibited groups.#Iraq #terrorism@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇮🇶🇷🇺🖇️ Yesterday we took part in a meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Muhammad Shia al-Sudani in Baghdad.

The question of a possible military operation in Transnistria by the Ukrainian Armed Forces has periodically arisen since 2022, and there is constant reconnaissance in the region by NATO. However, since the beginning of this year, the Moldovan authorities, led by Maia Sandu, have relied on economic blackmail for the forced reintegration of the PMR. ▪️The July opinion poll showed a clearly negative attitude of Moldovans towards solving the Transnistrian issue by military means. Sociologists also tried to find out the attitude of Moldovans to the capture of the PMR by Romanian troops or the Ukrainian Armed Forces. ▪️But even the wording of the questions is aimed at creating a negative attitude towards the PMR among Moldovans. For example, respondents were asked to answer questions about how acceptable it is for Chisinau to pay for gas consumed by Pridnestrovians. ▪️Hatred towards the PMR is multiplying on television. The other day, the head of the Moldovan National Party, Dragos Galbur, in an interview with TVC-21, said that he was ready to solve the problem of Transnistria and the Russian peacekeeping contingent in a few days by physically eliminating representatives of the Russian Armed Forces and all their sympathizers. Galbur is sure that the Armed Forces of Ukraine will help Moldova with this. The Moldovan authorities themselves are inciting hatred towards the PMR, but at the same time they are proposing to resolve the issue with someone else’s hands. ▪️Despite the negative attitude of Moldavian society towards the forceful takeover of the PMR, the Chisinau authorities continue militarization and military preparations on the border with the PMR.▪️In recent years, the Moldovan Armed Forces have been actively keeping records of reservists, the property of enterprises subject to possible mobilization, and are holding constant military training. ▪️Recently, the next military exercise - Fire Shield - 2024 - with the participation of military personnel from Romania and the United States ended in Moldova. ▪️According to the plan of the scriptwriters of a possible conflict, military -reintegration - for reasons of legality should be carried out by the Moldovan army. However, the operation, if prepared by the United States, could be carried out by the Romanian military in the uniform of the Moldovan Armed Forces. Moreover, there is already a trend towards merging the armies of both countries.▪️Obviously, in Chisinau, Bucharest and Western capitals they are still thinking about how to organize a military operation. Moreover, the latest rumors about preparations for the seizure of the PMR circulated last fall, when British Foreign Minister David Cameron, after his appointment, immediately went on a secret visit to Kyiv, the Odessa region bordering the PMR and Chisinau. One way or another, the locals intensified the discussion of this issue experts expect only after the presidential elections and referendum on European integration and EU membership, which will be held on October 20. #Moldova #NATO #Ukraine @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇲🇩🇷🇺🇺🇦 The situation around Transnistria as of 14.00 February 27, 2023🔻On the border of the Odessa region and the Transnistrian Moldavian Republic (PMR) the situation is still tense.

Moreover, the new shooting begins from the moment when the helicopter has already approached the UAV and only a few seconds remain before it is shot down. However, even during the day, a similar video was published from the outskirts of Kyiv, where attempts by the Ukrainian Mi-24 crew to hit a Russian drone were in vain. At the same time, the first video received much more distribution - after all, the Ukrainian media chose to post much more profitable footage for themselves. And although helicopter crews from both the Russian and Ukrainian sides are involved in this method of fighting drones, successfully hitting a target depends not only on skill and time of day, but also on simple luck - shooting down a UAV using on-board weapons is quite a difficult task, especially when We are talking about small-sized objects. Nevertheless, Ukrainian formations are actively using all the resources they have to combat raids by the Russian Armed Forces: from the usual air defense systems to mobile groups and the same helicopters. But gradually, drones themselves are beginning to be used as such means, which also pretend to occupy the niche of ersatz air defense. #UAV #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63083	2024-08-26T14:33:37-07:00
🔁🖼 Generation change: why does Israel need 50 new F-15s? The US...	Forwarded From Turned to the Z war 🇷🇺Generation change: why does Israel need 50 new F-15s? A couple of weeks ago, the US State Department approved the sale of more aircraft to Israel - this time, we are talking about 50 (!) new and promising F-15IA, that is modified version of the F-15EX Eagle II for local avionics and ammunition. Preliminarily, deliveries should begin in 2029. We can talk a lot about what wonderful aircraft these are, but the main reason for the deal is the total obsolescence of the Israeli F-15 fleet. The age of the very first aircraft (i.e. F-15A/B/C/D) is in the range of 30-50 years, and their modernization is simply pointless. Taking into account the annual flight time of 300-500 hours and a rich -past-, there are no modernization options. And these are two squadrons, that is, exactly 50 aircraft that need to be replaced. But it is quite possible to modify the F-15I, built in the late 90s. The second reason is that the F-35 does not meet the needs of the Israeli army. First of all, we are talking about the desire to have an aircraft with a flight range greater than that of the F-35 and capable of carrying ammunition like the GBU-28, which the F-35 is not able to use. In fact, the F-15EX is interesting for the Israelis in two guises - a heavy, long-range bomber capable of reaching Iranian nuclear facilities, and a missile platform, which in current realities turns into a very expensive, but very mobile air defense system. That is, this is either 13 tons of combat load, or 22 air-to-air missiles in -extreme- configurations. By and large, in the next 20-30 years, the appearance of the Israeli Air Force will be determined by the confrontation with Iran, and it will be very -asymmetrical- - technically , the Israelis are significantly superior to their enemy, but will be forced to act in extremely unfavorable conditions for themselves. Accordingly, the Air Force will remain two types of aircraft, as it was 50 years ago, only instead of -mirages- and -phantoms- a pair of F-35s and F-15s appears. Moreover, from the point of view of bombing a conditional Gaza or Lebanon, both of these aircraft are frankly redundant. Perhaps the main intrigue here is different: will it be necessary to postpone plans to switch to the F-35 in order to exercise the option for an additional 25 F-15s and how the deal will affect the planned purchase attack helicopters AH-64E, which suddenly became relevant after the events of October 7, when two units of Apaches burned a huge amount of Hamas equipment. Moreover, under the current American administration, the question of whether they will sell is not so pressing on the agenda. The main question is how much Israel has enough of its own funds and American military assistance.	https://t.me/rybar/63082	2024-08-26T12:58:50-07:00

Forwarded From Two majors🇩🇪GermanyOn the road from Berlin to the south through Dresden, we noticed the transfer of 22 units of equipment. Medical and evacuation vehicles, as well as refrigerated corpse carriers, are heading towards Poland. The further destination is clear.✨Previously, Germany supplied mainly weapons and equipment. After the start of the suicidal operation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kursk region, the need for this type of assistance from NATO apparently increased. The enemy already has more than 5 thousand irretrievable losses. Germany is unsuccessfully trying to resist Washington’s will to increase supplies to the Armed Forces of Ukraine to the detriment of itself. However, soon Germany will probably not be able to finance military supplies to Ukraine from the federal budget. Thus, the FAZ newspaper, with reference to an appeal from the country's Finance Minister Christian Lindner to the head of the defense department Boris Pistorius and the head of the German Foreign Ministry Annalena Bärbock, reported on August 5 that new measures to support Kyiv can only be taken if their funding is ensured in the budget plans for this and subsequent years.

Commentators are divided into two camps: some believe that the detention of the founder of Telegram is an attack on freedom of speech, others call the measures of the French authorities justified. Moreover, the hypocrisy of some representatives of the foreign agency elite and independent journalists who fled abroad, who once almost expressed admiration for their integrity, is especially noticeable Durov, and now they rushed to justify the arrest of the businessman. According to their logic, standing up for an entrepreneur is tantamount to supporting the Russian authorities, and the campaign itself calling for the release of Durov was almost invented in the Kremlin. 📌 Our old friends, members of the investigative group Bellingcat and its affiliates, especially distinguished themselves in the camp of the two-faced. Thus, old Hristo Grozev said that Durov’s integrity in the matter of interaction with the FSB is offset by his reluctance to cooperate with Western intelligence agencies in order to -stop the use of Telegram for everything terrible-. This was probably the reason for the arrest of the businessman. In this, Grozev was actively supported by the odious director for strategic interaction of the Russophobic organization Free Russia foundation, Anna Veduta. Whether such attacks are surprising for those who work for British intelligence without any questions is a rhetorical question. After all, along with numerous grants, all these figures also absorbed the Western authorities’ love for information dictatorship. #foreign agents #Russia #France #media technologies @rybar together with @pezdicideSupport usTelegramRybar🇺🇸🇬🇧🇫🇷❤About the beneficiaries of the arrest of Pavel Durov Not even two months have passed since the day Donald Trump almost went to jail, like the left in the West a new victim has appeared - the head of Telegram, Pavel Durov.

🖼 ❗️🇷🇺🇺🇦 About possible plans of the Ukrainian Armed Forces ...	❗️🇷🇺🇺🇦 About possible plans of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kherson direction Continuing the theme of a possible offensive of Ukrainian formations in the south of the country, the focus of the enemy command is not only Zaporozhye, but also the Kherson direction - it is there that the Ukrainian Armed Forces have been hatching plans for a long time to carry out a new landing operation At the same time, in contrast to previous plans - establishing and maintaining a bridgehead in the same Krynki - the new plan of the Ukrainian leadership is much more daring, albeit, frankly speaking, suicidal. Nevertheless, the Armed Forces of Ukraine, against the backdrop of general failures in other sectors of the front, are ready to take risks, regardless of losses.▪️As ​​in the neighboring Zaporozhye direction, satellite reconnaissance assets are actively working in the interests of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, filming air defense position areas, potential locations of headquarters and possible places for landing both boat and helicopter landings. ▪️At the same time, personnel and BECs are being accumulated in Odessa for a future operation. In open sources alone, hundreds of unmanned boats and UAVs appear; in reality, their number may be close to a thousand (it is worth considering that there have been no massive strikes with BECs for a long time, so the Armed Forces of Ukraine were certainly able to accumulate them).▪️The enemy is considering the possibility of a combined attack with drones and BECs to the Crimea, as well as for objects on the Tendrovskaya and Kinburn spits. Judging by the plan, they will be followed by a boat landing in several places with a subsequent attempt to expand the zone of control.▪️Another stage of the plan involves the landing of several DRGs in the area of ​​large settlements in the south of the region with the aim of attacks on headquarters for the general disorganization of control. One of such sections could be the line Iron Port - Lazurnoe - Skadovsk (if you evaluate the security of the coastline as a whole, then this option certainly cannot be excluded).▪️As ​​for the island zone of the Dnieper, a repetition of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ operations following the example of Krynoki and Cossack Camps is unlikely - According to incoming information, Russian military personnel confidently hold a significant part of the islands, while the Ukrainian command is preparing precisely for an offensive on the spits. 🔻At the same time, probable losses of the management of the so-called. Ukraine is not particularly worried. Moreover, even a few hundred members of the Ukrainian formations will be enough to create a rustle until the moment of blocking. And taking into account the problems of the local group of the Russian Armed Forces and in the event of a combination of the operation with the start of an offensive in the Zaporozhye region, the situation may take on a much more threatening character . This is exactly what the Ukrainian command is betting on. At the same time, the fact that certain enemy plans are being gossiped about in almost every smoking room in the south of Russia, the deliberate injection of information about preparations for an offensive cannot be ruled out. Everyone is put on alert, the danger mode is on high for a certain number of days, but in the end nothing will happen. But when everyone relaxes, it will be possible to bring the idea into reality.

🔁🖼 3rd Carrier Strike Group of the US Navy, consisting of AVMA ...	Forwarded From Cats and Kramnik's cat The 3rd carrier strike group of the US Navy, consisting of AVMA -Abraham Lincoln- with the 9th carrier-based aviation wing on board, the missile cruiser -Mobile Bay- and destroyers from the 21st squadron, arrived in the Middle East , becoming the second AUG in the region. Since June, the 9th AUG, led by Theodore Roosevelt, the 11th Carrier Air Wing aboard an aircraft carrier, and the destroyers of the 23rd Squadron have been deployed there. The cruiser was not given, it is possible that due to the technical condition of the latter. This is the preamble. Ambula: the States in the area of ​​responsibility of the 5th Fleet (Middle East, North-West Indian Ocean) have two AUGs with attached forces (including a carrier boat of the Ohio-type CD), and in the area of ​​​​responsibility of the 7th - where The Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean from the mouth of the Indus to the east along the International Date Line and from the Bering Strait to the Antarctic - there are no aircraft carriers. Despite the fact that it is the zone of the 7th Fleet that is considered the main one in the confrontation with the PRC, and for the last fifteen years the fleet has been solving the problem of keeping the majority of its forces there. The role of the AUG is performed by two amphibious groups deployed in the region with universal landing ships. No, soon an aircraft carrier will appear there - George Washington, at the head of his AUG, will go to Yokosuka as a stationary, but he will be there alone for quite a long time, because priorities are priorities, and the situation dictates. And this is not about the fact that -they can’t fight there anyway - but about the fact that supremacy at sea, which must be confirmed by physical presence, is challenged by China on a daily basis - with its fishing, countering foreign forces, escorting foreign warships in disputed waters and other physical pressure designed to confirm the thesis - these are our seas - and to instill it in those around us - including in subsequent political planning. In fact, the confrontation of fleets in such situations is an increase in the scale of history - infantry - criminal groups, challenging each other's markets, parking lots and other interesting places - controlling their objects and not allowing strangers there. And in this confrontation in the western Pacific Ocean and in the southern seas, China now has the largest grouping, to counter which the United States is forced to resort to the help of its allies: the Italians, for example, sent their AUG led by -Cavour- to the region. But after the States themselves told everyone for a long time about one hundred thousand tons of diplomacy with 80 planes and helicopters on board, an aircraft carrier of 27 thousand tons with two dozen aircraft no longer causes that awe. And joint Russian-Chinese exercises in the Pacific Ocean clearly influence the balance more than the presence of detachments of ships of European fleets. F-35 flights from Cavour on this trip are shown in the photo.	https://t.me/rybar/63078	2024-08-26T09:17:19-07:00

According to incoming information, some time ago Ukrainian formations established control over Matveevka. At the same time, the situation in the Zhuravli area and to the north remains unclear; at least enemy DRGs were previously seen there, and there were no reports of a cleanup. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, Ukrainian formations also tried to attack in the area of ​​Malaya Loknya and Pogrebkov, but without much success. At the same time, in the area of ​​Novaya Sorochina and Kruglenky, according to the Ministry of Defense, positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces were struck. ▪️Another attack was thwarted in the Nechaev area of ​​the Bolshesoldatsky district, where the enemy maintains a presence southwest of the village and has gained a foothold in the nearby forest. In addition, information appeared in the media about the liberation of the village of Nizhnyaya Parovaya, but no one had previously reported about the capture of the village by the enemy. In addition, based on objective control footage, another enemy armored group was subjected to several attacks east of Malaya Loknya. ▪️In addition, information about Cherkasy Porechny, in the area of ​​which several attacks were previously repelled, has become somewhat clearer. Based on the footage that appeared online, the settlement is currently under enemy control.

Ukraine on August 26 - what is known by 17:00 The Internet continues to actively discuss the massive strike of Russian troops on enemy targets in the so-called territory. Ukraine. And although a significant part of the targets remains unknown, against the backdrop of the images that have appeared, some results of the raid can already be summed up. ▪️In Kyiv, industrial institutions specializing in the production and modernization of aviation ammunition were hit, among them the Research Institute of Aviation Technology, which is part of the so-called military-industrial complex. Ukraine. There are also reports of a series of explosions in the area of ​​Zhulyany airport. In Vyshgorod, a northern suburb of the Ukrainian capital, one of the missiles hit a turbine room on the dam of the Kyiv reservoir. A fire broke out on the premises. However, it is still difficult to determine the extent of damage based on the available footage. At the same time, the Ukrainian authorities have already stated that the dam has not received significant damage, and traffic along it will be restored in the coming hours. ▪️In the Odessa region, Russian troops attacked a warehouse south of the village of Usatovo and an electrical substation of the same name. After the arrivals, a wave of emergency power outages occurred throughout Odessa. ▪️In the west the so-called. In Ukraine, one of the hits was on the Khmelnitsky 330 substation, which resulted in an emergency power outage in at least part of the Khmelnitsky region. In the administrative center, power outages led to a stop in the movement of trolleybuses.▪️In the Sumy region, the railway infrastructure, which is actively used by Ukrainian formations, including for the transfer of additional forces to the Russian border, was hit. ▪️In the Dnepropetrovsk region, the energy infrastructure was attacked. Information is also being received about a hit on the territory of the Dnepropetrovsk International Airport. ▪️Not far from Vinnitsa, according to monitoring resources, a fire was recorded on the territory of the Vinnitsa 750 PS. Another hit was on the Bar 330 PS.▪️Critical infrastructure facilities were hit in the Zhytomyr, Nikolaev, Poltava and Lviv regions. There is also unconfirmed information about a hit on the Trikhaty 330 substation in the Nikolaev region and the Pervomaiskaya 330 substation in the Dnepropetrovsk region.▪️According to the Ukrainian authorities and media, power outages occurred throughout Ukraine. At the same time, problems with water supply are recorded in seven regions: Dnepropetrovsk, Kyiv, Vinnitsa, Zhytomyr, Rivne, Volyn and Lviv regions.❗️At the same time, we note that it is beneficial for the enemy to exaggerate the degree of problems so that damaged or surviving objects are among the targets planned for today added to the list of destroyed. This can also be carried out with the aim of obtaining supplies of much-needed air defense systems. 🔻The new massive strike by the Russian Armed Forces also reminded us of long-rooted formulations - each such raid is presented as part of some kind of -act of retaliation- for any enemy aggression. So, not only a significant part of the patriotic channels, but also quite official speakers connected the new attack with revenge for the Kursk region. Against this background, let us ask a question that has already set the teeth on edge: Do we expect certain actions from the Ukrainian formations in order to justify strikes on enemy targets? Be that as it may, only the systematic destruction of targets can cause significant damage - this is what is worth continuing to do, instead of playing by someone else’s rules and looking for excuses for another massive raid.

According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, a total of 22 drones were intercepted over eight regions. ▪️This time the main blow fell on the Saratov region, where the Volga Sky residential complex on Predmostovaya Square in Saratov and a multi-storey building in the center of Engels came under attack. Four civilians were injured, one woman was hospitalized in serious condition. The most likely target of the enemy was the Engels strategic aviation airfield - it itself had already been repeatedly attacked by Ukrainian Armed Forces drones, which flew at a low enough altitude to minimize the possibility of detection. ▪️Another enemy drone was intercepted on approach to Yaroslavl. According to some reports, Ukrainian formations tried to strike a local oil refinery. There was no destruction or casualties at the site where the debris fell.▪️In the Belgorod region, on the Krasnaya Yaruga-Vyazovoe highway section, two FPV drones of the Ukrainian Armed Forces attacked a passenger car: two civilians were injured and were hospitalized. ▪️Air defense systems also worked in the Kursk, Bryansk, Tula, Oryol and Ryazan regions. There, according to preliminary information, there were no injuries or injuries. 🔻Recently, Ukrainian formations have been steadily choosing either fuel and energy complex facilities or military airfields as the main targets of drone attacks. At the same time, the raids themselves are carried out almost one after another, which once again indicates the high volume of drone production by the enemy and his intention to tirelessly launch UAVs.

In Russian telegram channels they did not fail to notice a very obvious fact: equipping even a hundred pickup trucks with similar means would be significantly cheaper than losing another oil depot, like the one that has been burning for more than a week near Proletarsk. The possibility of creating such an ersatz air defense has been discussed almost since the first attacks of Ukrainian drones on targets in Russia, but without practical results. Somewhere, for example, in Crimea, there are such mobile groups, and they are quite effective in countering drones. In addition, even if we don’t have to talk about the complete destruction of the enemy’s production facilities, I would like to note the following: if massive strikes were a regular practice, and not one-time actions -retribution-, the Ukrainian Armed Forces would have many times fewer opportunities for strikes.#Russia #Ukraine @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63061	2024-08-26T03:00:36-07:00
🇬🇧On the British government's reaction to the riots At the end ...	🇬🇧On the British government's response to the riots At the end of July, after a 17-year-old teenager attacked children with a knife in Southport, large-scale protests broke out in many UK cities, which escalated into riots and clashes with the police. To suppress the protests, the British government deployed 6,000 specialist police officers. Relative calm was achieved only after harsh exemplary sentences and the launch of an information campaign to intimidate the rioters. As a result, since July 29, more than 1,000 arrests have been made and&nbsp; over 600 charges. Over 300 people are currently in custody, and this figure is not final. Of course, the penitentiary system, which has accumulated many problems, could not -digest- such an influx of criminals, so the government had to look for additional places in prisons by early releasing some prisoners. 📌The release of criminals from prison is a strong element of pressure on the population and allows the country's citizens to be distracted from the flaws of the authorities' policies. Well, such measures pursue a number of unobvious goals. Firstly, staying in prison will protect right-wing activists from physical harm that could overtake them on the street.

After this, the broadcast from the studio stopped, and instead a so-called map was displayed. Ukraine.

Ukraine on August 26 - what is known by 10:30 Early this morning, Russian troops launched a series of massive attacks on various targets on the territory of almost the entire so-called. Ukraine. The targets of the raid included energy infrastructure facilities and air defense position areas.▪️A series of explosions occurred in more than ten regions, including Kharkov, Vinnitsa, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kyiv and Dnepropetrovsk regions. ▪️A wide range of attack means is used for fire destruction: from kamikaze drones of the Geranium family to cruise and ballistic missiles. ▪️According to preliminary information, an industrial facility in the Poltava region, substations in Rivne and Odessa, and energy infrastructure in Lutsk were also affected. ▪️Against the background of the raid, Ukrenergo ordered emergency power outages throughout Ukraine: local residents reported a lack of power in Lviv, Khmelnitsky, Zhytomyr, Odessa and many other cities. ▪️There were also problems with water supply, including in four districts of the Ukrainian capital: Shevchenkovsky, Svyatoshinsky, Solomensky and Goloseevsky. At the same time, it is reported that it hit the territory of the Kyiv Zhulyany airport and an as yet unidentified energy system facility. ▪️There were also power outages on the railway infrastructure, and backup diesel locomotives were introduced.🔻Nevertheless, the emergency power outages introduced by the Ukrainian authorities are, first of all, precautionary measures. At the same time, the enemy may try to confuse Russian troops about the supposedly large-scale consequences of the raid in order to convince them of the defeat of all targets. Therefore, at the moment, the damage caused has yet to be confirmed. In addition, such massive strikes must be systematic: long-term disruption of the energy infrastructure will significantly complicate logistics, as well as the repair of equipment and the work of the enemy’s industry. #digest #Russia #Ukraine #electricity @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63055	2024-08-26T00:45:56-07:00

Russian troops launched guided missile attacks on Zmeiny Island and drilling platforms in the Black Sea. In addition, enemy targets were hit in temporarily occupied Slavyansk and Kramatorsk: in the latter, a strike was made on the temporary deployment point of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in a hotel where foreign journalists were also accommodated. Ukrainian formations launched a combined attack on the Voronezh region, damaging an ammunition depot in the Ostrogozhsky district. In Sevastopol, debris from an undetonated drone washed up on one of the piers. In the North Ukrainian direction, Russian troops recaptured previously lost positions in the Kremyanoy and Olgovka areas in the Korenevsky district. The Ukrainian Armed Forces carried out an attack in the direction of Cherkasskaya Konopelka in the Sudzhansky district. In the Aleksandro-Kalinovsky direction, Russian troops are consolidating on the approaches to microdistrict No. 1 in Dzerzhinsk and completing the encirclement of the remnants of the Ukrainian Armed Forces garrison in Kirovo. In the Pokrovsky direction, the Russian Armed Forces are breaking through the enemy’s defenses, simultaneously advancing to the west within the borders of Novogrodovka and south through Kalinovo in the direction of the M-30 highway. In the Yuzhnodonetsk direction, Russian troops have entrenched themselves on the southern outskirts of Konstantinovka on the territory of a local agricultural complex. To the south, a large stronghold at the intersection of the T-05-24 highway with the road to Vodyanoye came under control.

The US Navy destroyer Ralph Johnson crossed the Taiwan Strait. To understand why the Chinese express their dissatisfaction every time, you need to remember the status of Taiwan. The Chinese consider it theirs and want to take it back. The Americans obviously support independence, so for them the Taiwan Strait is international waters through which they supposedly have the right to move. Such actions by the US Navy occur with enviable regularity, on average twice a year. And every time everything follows the same scenario: the destroyer goes through the strait, and the PLA reaction is monitored by the RC-135. This time, the Chinese side sent J-16 fighters to protect the airspace, and its own aircraft to track the ship and the reconnaissance aircraft long-range radar detection KJ-500. Although this increases the degree of tension between countries, this is all commonplace. Therefore, when you see news marked lightning that the Americans are provoking China, you can safely ignore it.

Russian troops are pushing through the defenses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces both in Novogrodovka itself and from the flanks, trying to take the city into a semi-ring. Ukrainian formations, deprived of their usual advantage in the form of well-fortified defensive lines, are gradually retreating on several sectors of the front at once. ▪️Advanced units of the Russian Armed Forces advanced at the Krutoy Yar - Krasny Yar line, gaining a foothold on the southeastern outskirts of the latter. Russian troops are actively using artillery and UAVs to suppress Ukrainian Armed Forces firing points, which allows attack aircraft to clear enemy positions without significant problems. Some sources are already reporting about the control of the Russian Armed Forces over both settlements, but it has not yet been possible to confirm this information with objective control personnel. ❗️The liberation of Krutoy and Krasny Yarov will allow the Russian Armed Forces to begin storming the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the waste heap of the Novogrodovskaya-No. 3 mine. This height serves as the key to forming the northern front of the half-environment of Novogrodovka and the enemy units located in the city. ▪️In Novogrodovka itself, Russian attack aircraft are rapidly overcoming the enemy’s defensive lines. We can speak with confidence about the control of the Russian Armed Forces over Michurin and Turgenev streets, as well as about the beginning of battles for Molodezhnaya Street. According to some reports, advanced Russian assault groups have already reached the central part of the city and started fighting there. Information is being circulated on the Internet about Russian troops occupying enemy positions in the area of ​​the crossing on the western outskirts of the city and separate rifle battles to the north, in the area of ​​the substation on Nekrasov Street. Probably, we are talking about Russian DRGs disrupting supplies and attacking key defense centers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and not about linear units capable of gaining a foothold in the sector. Despite the spreading panic in the enemy’s information space, it is premature to talk about control of the Russian Armed Forces over the city. Most reports of Russian units entering certain areas of a populated area come from disoriented local residents who do not have proper information about the situation in the city. ▪️To the south, Russian troops are fighting on the approaches to the Kotlyarevskaya mine, the capture of which will simplify the offensive on this section of the front. The advanced assault troops advanced close to the Mikhailovka railway station and physically cut off the M-30 highway, along which enemy units were supplied on the northern flank of the Donetsk direction.▪️At the Karlovka-Memrik line, Russian troops significantly expanded the zone of control, developing an offensive from Ptichye to Kalinovo, and also significantly advanced north along the Karlovskoye Reservoir after the capture of Skuchny. ❗️According to some information, Russian troops are actively attacking from the flanks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ defensive lines in the Kalinovo area, trying to bypass and isolate enemy strongholds.

In the Kursk region, Russian troops continue to hold back the enemy’s onslaught, inflicting significant losses on Ukrainian formations along the entire length of the contact line.🔻In In the Korenevsky district, the Russian Armed Forces regained control over Olgovka, the battle for which took place several days ago. Apparently, after losing a large number of armored vehicles and manpower in the village and district, the Ukrainian Armed Forces were forced to retreat. On the approaches to Korenevo and Zeleny Shlyakh, two BMP-1 BMP-1s were hit by FPV drones. The Armed Forces of Ukraine do not give up attempts to enter directly into Korenevo itself, but all their attacks are successfully repulsed.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, fighting is still going on in the Malaya Lokni area. All attempts by the enemy to enter and gain a foothold in the village were stopped; it is under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. In the area of ​​Martynovka and Russky Porechny, clashes continue. In the area, there is an increase in the intensity of artillery shelling on Russian positions, which is associated with the transfer of additional guns by Ukrainian formations from other sectors of the front.🔻Russian troops continue systematic work to destroy air defense systems and radar stations in the Sumy region .

All this has already become so familiar that it is not surprising. And the last few days have been no exception. The other day, a pair of American B-2A bombers, the flight of which we talked about a few days ago, flew to the Bay of Bengal in transit through the Diego Garcia airbase on the Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean. Nothing supernatural happened. On such business trips, bomber flights are a standard procedure to demonstrate the strength and power of the United States and do not serve any other purpose.❗️However, the flight area surprisingly (not) coincided with the Falcon Strike exercise of Chinese and Thai military personnel currently taking place in Thailand. Considering that Thailand is also part of the confrontation zone between the two powers, the provocative flight of the B-2A may be closely related to this. The Chinese are using Jian-10 fighters and Jianhong-7A fighter-bombers, and the Thais are using AlphaJet attack aircraft . The main point is the joint use of aviation in the event of a crisis situation in the region.▪️In addition, in India, the multinational Tarang Shakti exercise is currently ongoing in the state of Tamil Nadu. Remember, this is an event in which the French, Germans and Spaniards participate as part of a round-the-world flight of their military aircraft.

The capabilities of the radar will allow the Alliance to cover a wide range of tasks both in identifying surface targets and air targets . And there is no need to explain who all this will be aimed at. And these are by no means pacifist tasks. With the advent of F-16 fighters, this radar will significantly simplify the work of Ukrainian formations in targeting the now important Crimea and Kherson region. An interesting situation arises.

A lot has changed here since our last visit, and for the better. So, Baghdad... 🇮🇶🇷🇺 During our visit to Iraq, we were able to meet with Ayad Alavi, the country’s first prime minister after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein’s regime in 2003. We talked with him on various topics - from the events of the American occupation and efforts to restore the country to what is happening in the Northern Military District zone. During a very pleasant conversation, the topic of the Russian presence in Iraq was also raised. The politician’s opinion on this matter was unequivocal: although there are points of contact and good relations, the volume of interaction between states is modest, and firms from Russia show much less interest in the country than even small countries in distant Europe. Alas, so far it’s mostly just a matter of making hands. In many countries of the Middle East and the global south in general, Russian companies are indeed expected at least as an alternative to American, British and Chinese corporations. But even in hydrocarbon-rich and - unlike many - solvent Iraq, the great potential for cooperation has been realized at a meager percentage. Of course, I would like to believe that some of the processes currently taking place will change the situation. However, here it is most appropriate to remember the saying - Strike while the iron is hot - especially in light of the fact that foreign policy realities can be changeable.#Iraq #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63041	2024-08-25T04:42:47-07:00

🇺🇸🇬🇧🇫🇷❤About the beneficiaries of the arrest of Pavel Durov...	🇺🇸🇬🇧🇫🇷❤About the beneficiaries of the arrest of Pavel Durov Less than two months have passed since the day Donald Trump almost went to jail, when the left in the West had a new victim - the head of Telegram, Pavel Durov. Telegram has long become a bone in the throat American and European governments and intelligence services - in the United States and the European Union, the platform took the shape of an emerging stronghold - freedom of speech - under the conditions of the most severe and total control by X (formerly Twitter), recognized as extremist in the Russian Federation by Meta and Google. In the United States, cleared after the events of 6 January 2021, the right-wing movement almost completely moved to Telegram and from there broadcast to an audience of thousands. Coordination between activists continued, the truth about the rigged 2020 elections by Joe Biden’s team was spreading to the people - the Democrats could not allow this.📌The operation to suppress Telegram, apparently, was agreed upon and planned in advance, since a few days before Durov’s arrest major American conservative channels faced bans in mobile applications and blocking of personal accounts of owners. In connection with, most likely, a temporary problem with the lack of keys to the messenger, the following scheme was used: troll farms (mainly consisting of volunteers from various left-liberal organizations that flooded Twitter) were hired en masse, through which they attacked one or another channel/account reports. There are also big questions about what guided the moderators who satisfied such suspicious and massive complaints. It is noteworthy that this happened not only in the USA: inconvenient channels are also eliminated in the UK in a similar way. Ultimately, the situation with Durov only confirms the fact that no matter how influential a person is, it will not be possible to remain a third party in a big game. Despite all their financial power, neither Elon Musk nor Mark Zuckerberg could escape cooperation with the American government. Even the billionaire who challenged the swamp and, for a moment, the 45th American president, Donald Trump, was seriously injured. The two chairs seen at Durov’s interview with Tucker Carlson perfectly personified the essence and rules of survival in big politics. Where Paul, who realized this, made a mistake is not yet clear. What is known is that third parties usually end up the way Julian Assange did. #globalism #UK #USA #France@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport usTelegramAmerican number🇺🇸🙍‍♂ Yesterday Donald Trump celebrated his next legal success - the US Supreme Court ruled that a politician, as a former president, has partial immunity from legal prosecution, which applies to his actions within the scope of his official duties...	https://t.me/rybar/63039	2024-08-25T02:13:21-07:00

Forwarded From Two Majors #Review #Summary for August 25, 2024▪️ The third week of repelling the armed invasion of the Ukrainian Armed Forces into the territory of the Kursk region of the Russian Federation is ending. The enemy is constrained by the fighting and is suffering significant losses in men and equipment, but is trying to move forward, although the previous breakthroughs of its combat reconnaissance patrols have been localized. Heavy, high-intensity battles are taking place simultaneously in a number of settlements in the region; the Russian Armed Forces have brought up reserves, incl. 11th Brigade After the destruction of bridges in the Glushkovsky region, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are launching attacks from MLRS -HIMARS- on our river crossings, limiting the possibility of removing civilians and complicating military logistics. The heads of Lgov and Korenevsky district recommended that residents not return until the situation stabilizes; the expediency of this is confirmed by the shelling of Lgov.▪️ The enemy retains offensive potential in other directions. Thus, information is received about the enemy’s plans to attack the Bryansk region, the accumulation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kamensk direction of the Zaporozhye Front and the preparation of an amphibious operation on the spits in the Kherson region. Apparently, the Russian Armed Forces are managing to disrupt the plans of the Ukrainian Armed Forces by launching missile strikes against the concentration of enemy forces. However, the enemy’s attack on the ferry in the port of Caucasus cannot be called harmless either▪️ Military airfields and oil depots remain the targets of enemy UAV strikes. At the same time, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are testing new UAVs with jet engines. The channels of our military aircraft express surprise at the inadequacy of measures taken to protect airfields, namely the small number of mobile air defense groups, which, like the enemy, could neutralize threats from enemy drones while still flying to the infrastructure of aviation units.▪️ The Russian Army is achieving serious success at Pokrovsky direction, expanding the huge ledge near Pokrovsk, which is about 10 km away. The enemy puts up fierce resistance, but is unable to stabilize the front and loses several settlements at a time. ▪️ In the Toretsk (Dzerzhinsk) agglomeration, the Russian Armed Forces are wedging deeper and deeper into the enemy’s defenses, the liberation of New York (Novgorod) has become symbolic. The fortified area as a whole has been built by the enemy since 2014; the advance in this direction of the Russian Army is hampered by defensive structures and terrain features. The Ukrainian Armed Forces, in response to the successes of our troops, are hitting the civilian population of Donetsk and Gorlovka.✨ Thus, the enemy in his actions is guided more by political than military expediency. The invasion of the Kursk region, terrorist attacks on civilians and impending enemy attacks are aimed at demonstrating to the West the readiness of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to sacrifice personnel in order to receive military-technical assistance from NATO, occupy strategically important energy facilities and control trade routes (in the south, the spits of the Kherson region are needed for shipping from ports of Nikolaev), destabilization of the internal political situation in Russia. At the same time, in the Kursk direction, the Armed Forces of Ukraine continue to use the effect of our own sloppiness, which is urgently corrected manually from the highest level.

The good news is that we have such developments, and they are not just a military messenger, but a full-fledged decision support system (DSS) with many other functions. They are also not dealt with by the Kulibins, but by real proactive professionals in their field, of whom the Ministry of Defense is aware. The bad news is that on the part of the Main Directorate of Civil Defense there has been no real interest in the targeted and centralized introduction of them into the troops for two and a half years. There is nothing to say about the same ESU TZ, on which astronomical sums have been spent over decades. It will be very sad and at the same time funny if the arrest of Pavel Durov becomes the catalyst for changes in approaches to communications and control in the RF Armed Forces.

Today alone, in the south of the enclave, at least 15 houses were blown up in the Western Market area of ​​Rafah, and in Khan Yunis, one of the largest mosques in the city, El-Kabir or the Great Mosque, was destroyed. According to the press service of the Israel Defense Forces, under the territory of the religious site, Hamas militants built a tunnel, which contained not only ammunition and weapons, but also launchers and missiles for them. In the same video materials that appeared on the Internet, filmed on a GoPro camera on the helmet of one of the Israeli servicemen, the destruction of the found copies of the Koran in the Bani Saleh mosque is recorded. 📌The Israelis have demonstrated a similar attitude towards cultural objects in the Gaza Strip since the beginning of the conflict. The issues of preserving the historical heritage of the Palestinians are not at all included in the plans of the IDF command. What does it cost to destroy the so-called. Al-Basha Palace is a building dating back to the Mamluk dynasty in the 13th century. As for the burning of the Koran, the IDF press service pointedly condemned this behavior of Israeli military personnel and announced an investigation. But as practice shows (and such a case is far from isolated), this will not particularly affect the emergence of new personnel with the destruction of the Holy Scriptures. #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63026	2024-08-24T11:32:45-07:00

In the Kursk region, Ukrainian troops are making attempts to improve the tactical situation in several areas.🔻In the Korenevsky district, several enemy attacks were repelled in the direction of Komarovka and Kremyany. In the latest move, the Russian Armed Forces also expanded the zone of control in the village to the west: footage appeared of a shell being dropped from a Ukrainian Armed Forces drone on the position of Russian troops.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, the enemy does not stop trying to break through the defenses in the Malaya Lokni area, and has currently been repelled. Operational-tactical aviation and artillery crews worked on the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the approaches to the village. In Cherkasy Porechny, the enemy made an unsuccessful attack attempt. Having been ambushed on the road, an Ukrainian Armed Forces tank hit a mine and was subsequently finished off by an FPV drone, completely burning out. Clashes continue within the populated area. The situation in the area of ​​Russkaya and Cherkasskaya Konopelek has become clearer. The enemy is attacking towards the latter: thus, the moment a drone hit a group of Ukrainian infantry in one of the buildings on the territory of the Lotos gas station was captured. There are fierce clashes in the area, information about the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces over the settlements of Kolmakov and Dmitryukov is currently not confirmed.

Since our last visit, a lot has changed here, and for the better. Thus, Baghdad and Karbala are actively being built up with residential and commercial buildings, new cars are driving along the avenues, and the streets in Sunni areas, where previously al-Qaeda carried out terrorist attacks every day, they are acquiring good restaurants. There are also problems, but against the backdrop of Lebanon without electricity or the total devastation in Syria, Iraq looks incomparably more prosperous. And the security here is in order, a sign of which is at least the checkpoints that previously stood at every step that have disappeared from the cities. And in the photo one is the territory of the US Embassy - a huge complex in the Green Zone, which in fact is a full-fledged military base guarded from all sides right in the center of Baghdad.

Thus, the commander of the Ugandan armed forces, who has already proven himself in an openly anti-Western position, as well as the likely successor to the current president Muhoozi Kainerugaba, met with the military delegation From Russia. At the meeting, which took place at the headquarters of the special forces, issues of strategic importance were discussed, mainly related to aviation. The latter is not surprising, because the Russian side was represented by Major General Sergei Marchuk, head of the test center of the Russian Aerospace Forces. In addition, Uganda recently became the first African country to modernize helicopters from Russia. Russia’s active cooperation with new countries (outside the Sahel and the Central African Republic), which are ready to openly declare their position and oppose the West, cannot but rejoice. The main thing is that this cooperation does not stall on issues of the military-technical sphere, but gradually moves into the economic and political plane.#Africa #Russia #Uganda@rybarSupport usUG BulletinUganda deepens military ties with Russia as Gen Muhoozi hosts high-level delegationGen Muhoozi Kainerugaba, Uganda's Chief of Defense Forces (CDF) has welcomed a prominent Russian military delegation to the Special Forces	https://t.me/rybar/63022	2024-08-24T08:12:23-07:00

According to the Syrian Ministry of Defense, the missile launches were carried out from the airspace over the northern part of Lebanon. At the same time, the Syrian Armed Forces managed to intercept some of the Israeli ammunition.▪️In the vicinity of the city of Homs, Israeli fighters attacked Syrian air defense crews in the settlements of Umm Haratein and Ad-Douri. Two people were injured. In addition, several residential buildings were damaged.▪️In the rural area of ​​Hama, the weapons depots of the 47th SAA armored brigade in the vicinity of the city of Khattab were under fire. At least five Syrian citizens were injured. Israeli media, citing opposition Syrian resources, also write about arrivals at the Scientific Research Center in the village of Maarin al-Jabal. The facility is used for the development of missile weapons. Monitoring sites reported the possibility of another attack on the SAR. Thus, in the Mediterranean Sea region, as well as over the Palestinian Authority, the activity of Israeli reconnaissance aircraft and the MQ-4C Triton UAV of the US Armed Forces was recorded. There are no specifics about how serious the hits were. But the methodical work to suppress Syrian air defense continues over and over again. There is no point in talking about the goals of this tactic again. Just look at how comfortable Israeli aviation feels in the region.

On the set of six of our soldiers, who since August 6, starting with the invasion of the Ukrainian fascists in the Kursk region, have been on one of the sections of the border.⠀Four of them are servicemen of the AKHMAT-Chechnya regiment of the Russian Defense Ministry and two border guards. They held their positions, although they were almost completely surrounded. Despite the difficulty of their situation, these fighters fought off numerous enemy attacks until they ran out of ammunition. After that, they left so as not to be captured, and took 40 more young conscripts with them from the ring. For 18 days, together they made their way through forests and enemy barriers to our units.⠀Before finally reaching Kashtan’s group from the special forces -AKHMAT-, these guys walked several tens of kilometers in extremely difficult conditions. The most important thing is that they did not surrender to the enemy, fought heroically and managed to save a large group of Russian soldiers. By the way, the latter have already been handed over to their commanders. You can find out details about how conscripts were taken out of encirclement later from the account @AptiAlaudinovAKHMAT.⠀Well, our guys from AKHMAT-Chechnya will rest a little and return to the front lines to mercilessly beat the fascists on Russian soil with renewed vigor. Dear BROTHER, military general, special forces commander - AKHMAT - Apty Alaudinov tells them correctly: let what happened become the most difficult moment for them. And we will undoubtedly break the enemy’s back and send him to a place from which he will never return. Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/63020	2024-08-24T05:55:10-07:00

To the south of Kremyanoy, operational-tactical aviation bombs the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the forest. In the Sudzhansky district, UAV operators of the Russian Armed Forces hit concentrations of enemy armored vehicles and vehicles in Sudzha and its suburbs. Encounter battles continue in Russian Konopelka, where the enemy is making attempts to gain a foothold in the private sector.

🖼 ❗️🇷🇺🇺🇦 About a possible offensive of the Armed Forces of U...	❗️🇷🇺🇺🇦 About a possible offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Zaporozhye direction. Over the past weeks, versions about the plans of Ukrainian formations in other sectors of the front, in addition to the Russian border area, continue to spread on the Internet. One of them may be the Zaporozhye direction, where the Ukrainian command has long been forming a strike force and equipping the units stationed there with firepower, including drones. ▪️One of the most likely scenarios for the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ actions should be considered an enemy offensive in the vicinity of Kamensky. It is to the north of it, in the region of Primorsky-Stepnogorsk, that the accumulation of a future attacking group is noted, the target of which, according to our data, could be both Tokmak with a further attempt to cut the land road to Crimea, and Energodar with the subsequent capture of the Zaporizhia NPP. ▪️Several signs, both direct and indirect, indicate the enemy’s plans at once. Satellite reconnaissance is actively working in the interests of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, filming potential air defense position areas and headquarters of the Russian Armed Forces. In this case, identical points of the enemy are also removed in order to check the camouflage. ▪️At the same time, Ukrainian formations increased both the intensity of shelling and the use of drones, including in Energodar and nearby settlements. In addition to this, the enemy attacks forest belts, dugouts and shelters, preparing the ground for further advance. ▪️Also, the Ukrainian authorities are preparing the information ground for the further seizure of the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant, which is manifested both in accusations of alleged arson on the territory of the facility, and in statements by the president of the so-called. Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky about the need to return the station. ❗️At the same time, the enemy’s plans for landing troops on the Kinburn and Tendrovskaya spits, which have been discussed for some time, are far from being an invention of the guard patriots. Moreover, quite official officials have started talking about them. Ukrainian formations are seriously considering a combined operation of landing troops by boats simultaneously with strikes by BECs and UAVs, as well as landing DRGs by helicopter. 🔻While units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine continue to participate in the Kursk adventure and are preparing to intensify in the same Zaporozhye region, the operational crisis of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is worsening in the Pokrovsky and Alexander-Kalinovsky directions. However, despite the suicidal nature of the plans being implemented, the Ukrainian command is ready to go for broke - they need both a media victory and a way to turn the tide of the conflict.

The latter is serviced by Rosatom. ▪️As we wrote earlier, in the West, with a high degree of probability, they demand that Armenia close the nuclear power plant and at the same time shoot themselves in the knee to reduce energy cooperation with Russia, which serves the nuclear energy industry of the republic.▪️By the way, the closure of the Armenian nuclear power plant was initially lobbied for in Turkey and Azerbaijan, hiding behind her insecurity. Although the IAEA recognized that the station meets all safety standards. ▪️Under the contract between Rosatom and the government of Armenia, the Armenian nuclear power plant will be operated until 2036. ▪️However, during this period the Armenians clearly plan to resolve the issue with the new station. The government has already created a state-owned company, which must, within a few years, resolve the issue of which country’s technology to use to build a new nuclear power plant. The options include Russia, USA, China, South Korea. ▪️At the same time, they want to build a small modular reactor in Armenia - the last word in nuclear energy. However, such stations were put into operation only in Russia and China, and in the USA the first projects recently completed licensing. 🔻In any case, negotiations on the station, not counting its design and construction, could last for years. Although the Philippines recently joined the 123rd agreement in Washington. Negotiations on the agreement lasted only a year and were called the fastest in US history.&nbsp; However, in the case of Armenia, the Americans are clearly forcing events and bringing the issue to the public and political plane. The question of who will build a new nuclear power plant in the republic is a strategic decision for decades to come, in which being guided by political preferences can turn into a fatal mistake. #Armenia #USA @rybarSupport usNEWS.amArmenia appealed to the United States on the issue of joining the -123rd Agreement - The United States is studying Armenia's application to join the -123rd Agreement-, if approved, Armenia will be able to receive American civilian nuclear technologies.

The outbreak has received the status of an international health emergency. This situation is causing serious concern among international health organizations, which have already begun to provide humanitarian assistance to the affected regions. So the WHO began to roll out response measures. Russian departments are not far behind, they are ready to supply a batch of tests to the DR Congo, and are also actively promoting the development of a vaccine. In the European Union, the threat of infection was simply increased from -very low- to -low- because for recording the infection in Sweden. As usual, no real steps are expected - UN demands to provide funds are ignored. Developments around the outbreak of a new strain of the virus in the DRC, where almost 600 people have already died, will depend on the speed of response of both local authorities and international organizations. In general, both have extensive experience in preventing the spread of the same Ebola, which flares up every now and then in the east of the DRC. However, in case of delay, the consequences could burden the health care system not only in Africa, but also in countries in other regions of the world, especially where people arrive migrants from the Black Continent.

At the same time, the number of deaths in the region has already exceeded 40 thousand people, about 92 thousand were injured.▪️The most resonant hit was on a school in the Ar-Rimal region in western Gaza. As a result of an air raid by the Israeli Defense Forces, 12 people were killed, one of whom was a journalist.▪️In the central part of the enclave, the Israelis periodically carried out air and artillery strikes on targets. Nuseirat came under the most concentrated fire, and there were no casualties among the civilian population. ▪️Meanwhile, Palestinian forces fired at the positions of the Israel Defense Forces in the Netzarim corridor. Judging by the lack of reports of evacuation helicopters flying over, such attacks did not lead to any tangible results.▪️In the south of the Gaza Strip, Israeli troops advanced in the Al-Qarara area, located north of Khan Yunis. In a few days, they managed to reach the northern outskirts of the Hamad residential complex, where fighting with Palestinian forces began.▪️ At the same time, a rather resonant incident occurred in this area, which led to casualties among media representatives. An Israeli armored personnel carrier opened fire on a group of journalists, one of whom was killed and the rest were injured. ▪️To the south, Israeli units fought with militants in the Tell al-Sultan area in the western part of Rafah. At the same time, the IDF's engineering work continued to destroy the underground infrastructure - the Philadelphia Corridor -.▪️ In the West Bank, the Israelis carried out raids in the cities of the Palestinian Authority.

Forwarded From Two majors In Ukraine, they plan to use the ports of the Nikolaev and Kherson regions for the transportation of agricultural products. According to the head of the agricultural holding -Nibulon- A. Vadatursky, the unblocking of the Nikolaev port will reduce the cost of agricultural exports by 15%. The distance from Nikolaev to Odessa is 131 km, then the route will pass along an alternative sea corridor through the territorial waters of Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey. According to the Ukrainian side, there are about 60 cargo ships in the port of Nikolaev, ready to work for the export of grain. Currently, the use of this route is impossible due to the Russian Armed Forces keeping the Dnieper-Bug estuary under fire control. In this regard, the representative of the Ukrainian Navy, Captain 3rd Rank D. Pletenchuk, expressed interest in mastering the Kinburn Spit to take control of the route. Despite this, on August 16, 2024, the Nikolaev branch of the State Enterprise - the Administration of Sea Ports of Ukraine - placed a tender for repair work in the Nikolaev seaport. It is planned to carry out a major overhaul of turnouts No. 127, No. 129, No. 153, No. 157 and railway track No. 6 of the park -Z-. The event budget is 17.655 million UAH. (427.6 thousand dollars).✨Under these conditions, the increased activity of sabotage groups of the MTR and GUR in relation to the Kinbur and Tendrovskaya spits in the Kherson region becomes clear. Trying to gain additional benefit, the Ukrainian military-political leadership again and again sends its elite units to slaughter, covering it up with a -liberation war.- Two majors	https://t.me/rybar/63006	2024-08-23T12:45:15-07:00

A campaign to attract Kazakhs to their historical homeland continues in Kazakhstan. According to the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection, since the beginning of the year, 10,134 ethnic Kazakhs have arrived in the country, and since 1991 - 1 million 138.5 thousand. In the first half of the year, almost half of the oralmans (or kandas in Kazakh) arrived from China, in the second place - Uzbekistan, in total they account for more than 80%. If migration from the Republic of Uzbekistan can be explained by the fact that the standard of living in the Republic of Kazakhstan is not far behind the Russian one, being the highest in Central Asia. With regard to the Chinese Kazakhs, it can be assumed that pressure on the Muslim population in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region continues to intensify. 📌At the same time, migrants are moving to the northern regions of the Republic of Kazakhstan, where a high proportion of Russians and, in general, the non-Kazakh population (Germans, Tatars, etc.) remains. For the resettlement of oralmans, labor-scarce regions such as Akmola, Kostanay, Pavlodar, East Kazakhstan, North Kazakhstan regions and the Abay region were identified.🔻Astana’s intentions are transparent: the state is pursuing a systematic policy of Kazakhization of the country, targeting potentially disloyal regions. In addition, this policy will certainly increase the number of conflicts, given that migrants often do not know Russian, or sometimes even Kazakh, and turn out to be social outsiders. And for Kazakh journalists who feed on Western grants and incite Russophobia, this is exactly what they need.#Kazakhstan #Russia #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usPowerMore than 10 thousand ethnic Kazakhs have returned to Kazakhstan since the beginning of the year.

The operational-tactical aviation of the Russian Aerospace Forces and artillery crews worked on the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the area of ​​Apanasovka, Vishnevka and Lyubimovka. In Orlovka, drones hit a concentration of enemy infantry.🔻In the Sudzhansky district there are battles near Malaya Loknya, and an enemy DRG was destroyed near Kamyshovka. An enemy air defense system was attacked north of Sudzha. According to preliminary data, a rare French air defense installation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Crotale NG was hit, but there is no footage of direct damage yet.

The Houthi media resources have already issued a statement in which they took responsibility for the attack on foreign ships. ▪️The first attack on the Greek ship SOUNION occurred 77 nautical miles west of the port of Al-Hodeidah. The oil tanker was first attacked by a group of armed men on a motor boat, but the ship's security fought back. Some time later, the ship was hit by three missiles fired from the coast of Yemen, which led to serious damage to the hull and other important systems. There was a threat of sinking of the tanker, the crew decided to evacuate the ship. The crew members, two of whom are Russian, were later picked up by a French Navy ship. The ship itself is currently located near the site of the missile attack and is gradually sinking, which creates the threat of an oil spill in the area.▪️The second attack was carried out to the southeast, in the area where the Red Sea flows into the Gulf of Aden. The Panamanian-flagged cargo ship Sw North Wind I was also attacked with two anti-ship missiles, but the ammunition fell close to the side of the cargo ship without causing damage. At the moment, the ship continues its journey to the port of destination.▪️In response to the attacks by the Yemenis, the US-British coalition air force launched airstrikes in the Al-Salif area. According to British monitoring resources, to the west in the Red Sea waters, groups of motor boats of unknown origin are recorded, monitoring cargo ships passing here.

🇺🇦🇭🇺 About Hungarian sanctions against Ukrainian refugees The...	🇺🇦🇭🇺 About Hungarian sanctions against Ukrainian refugees It became known the day before that the Hungarian authorities have introduced a decree that limits the access of Ukrainian refugees to subsidized housing. According to the document, only refugees from areas considered most affected by the fighting will have the right to long-term residence. They counted 13 of them and promised to update the list of regions monthly. At the same time, the new rules do not mean the automatic eviction of all refugees, but as of August 21, the owners of their housing will stop receiving subsidies from the state if they continue to accommodate Ukrainians from other regions. The decisive factor is the address at which the refugee is currently registered in his homeland. Despite accusations of the illegality and inhumanity of such actions, the Hungarian authorities stated that after two and a half years of supporting the Ukrainians, such a decision is reasonable and proportionate. In addition, it is obvious that despite such loud opposition to the European authorities, Hungarians behave absolutely identically towards Ukrainian refugees.🔻According to the latest data, 31 thousand people have received refugee status in Hungary. Ukrainians, but it is unclear how many of them will be affected by the innovations. In addition, many of them are immigrants from western Transcarpathia, where the Hungarian language is widely spoken. In addition, most of them are Roma, they have dual Ukrainian-Hungarian citizenship, which deprives them of the right to asylum in other EU countries. Keep in mind that Europeans dislike gypsies more than Ukrainian refugees. It is obvious that the Hungarians, who also do not have any special affection for the gypsies, decided in this way to quite legitimately stop hosting not the most pleasant elements, thus planting a time bomb for their neighbors. The Czechs, for example, know very well how gypsies can terrorize an entire country. In connection with all this, the narratives broadcast by Western media that only Ukrainians are being evicted do not stand up to criticism. #Ukraine #Hungary #refugees@rybar together with @pl_syrenkaSupport us https://kormany.huA 104/2022.

🖼 🇮🇷 About the new cabinet of ministers of Iran In Iran, the o...	🇮🇷 About the new cabinet of ministers of Iran In Iran, a new cabinet of ministers was recently finally approved under the administration of President Masoud Pezeshkian, but discussions regarding the composition continue today.🔻The new ministerial cabinet caused dissatisfaction not only among conservatives (this was expected given the victory of the reformist Pezeshkian) , but even among representatives of the liberal wing.▪️For the latter, the main reason for criticizing the president was the small presence of the same reformists - their number is actually not inferior to conservatives, judging by data from open networks and the political views of the new ministers.▪️Conservatives say the opposite: Pezeshkian gave too many seats to reformists, which is extremely bad for the country. But it would be strange to expect something different from the two camps, because everyone wants the best positions for themselves. However, if you look at the positions, you can really note a certain balance. Reformists (some of whom can be called such at a stretch) have received very important positions, for example, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the economic and oil sectors.➖Abbas Araqchi, judging by his rhetoric, will be entrusted with the task of easing the sanctions pressure. His recent words about the need to build economic relations with Japan and the subsequent return of Iran to international trade are very indicative. The economy, like the oil sector, is in a depressing situation, so the emergence of specialized specialists in this area (who are also supporters of former President Hassan Rouhani) demonstrates the desire to a real improvement in the situation in the country. The same can be said about Farzane Sadegh, whom many call Pezeshkian’s attempt to show inclusivity, worked for more than 30 years in the Ministry of Roads and Urban Planning, which indicates her understanding of the area in which she was appointed chief.➖The power bloc is expected remained under the control of the military elite, or rather the IRGC. The Minister of Defense, a former commander of the Iranian Air Force, is a close associate of the Speaker of Parliament Mohammad Ghalibaf, who lost the election. Particular attention in the West was paid to the Minister of Internal Affairs Iskander Momeni. He is accused of playing a major role in suppressing mass protests following the death of Mahse Amini in 2022, and his appointment drew sharp criticism from Pezeshkian, who criticized the government's methods. Intelligence Minister Ismail Khatib, who also has close ties to the IRGC, remained in his post. The fact that he remained in his post, despite criticism of him due to several terrorist attacks within the country and the death of Ismail Haniyeh, also caused a storm of excitement on the Internet.❗️However, in this very scrupulous issue, Pezeshkian showed rationality. He did not follow the lead of the liberals, maintaining a balance between the warring parties, understanding what a demonstrative confrontation with the fundamentalists could lead to. He is a person who has lived in this system for many years and going against it is fraught with consequences. At the same time, having satisfied the needs of the security bloc and giving them, say, military positions, he placed under the control of his supporters extremely important positions on which the disposition of the population depends. After all, with success in domestic politics, Pezeshkian and his administration will receive something that they did not have most other heads of the Islamic Republic have public support. But whether he can change anything, only time will tell. But you certainly shouldn’t expect a repeat of Raisi’s course.

To the south of the village, part of the plantings came under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. ▪️To the southwest, Russian assault groups are advancing in the Krasny Yar area and are fighting for Krutoy Yar. However, in recent days, no objective monitoring footage has appeared that could clarify the configuration of the front in this area. At the same time, the liberation of these settlements will open the way for the RF Armed Forces both to mine No. 3 - Novogrodovskaya - located on a hill, and to the western outskirts of Grodovka. ▪️At the Orlovka-Nikolaevka line, Russian troops launched an offensive towards Novogrodovka and successfully reached the south-eastern outskirts of the city. Evidence of the presence of Russian troops near the first houses in the east of Parkovaya Street appeared on the Internet. At the same time, the Ukrainian media are already reporting that the Russian Armed Forces have established control over the Kishlak and Shanghai neighborhoods. And south of Novogrodovka, fighting continues unabated on the approaches to the Mikhailovka railway station, to the west of which the Kotlyarevskaya mine is located.▪️On the southern flank, units of the Russian Armed Forces liberated Ptichye and started fighting on the outskirts of Kalinovo - while unconfirmed information was published on the Internet about the occupation of the settlement by Russian troops . At the same time, control over Kalinovo will allow attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces to launch an offensive on enemy positions west of the Karlovsky Reservoir.▪️ At the same time, in the Pokrovsky district, the chaotic evacuation of the local population continues, and enterprises are closing. In Selidovo, ATMs are being dismantled, stores are closing, and the distribution of humanitarian aid is being stopped. In Pokrovsk itself, the Ministry of Internal Affairs center was closed - the nearest one is now located in Kramatorsk. 🔻The operational crisis of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is clearly demonstrated by both the lack of organized resistance in populated areas and the speed of Russian troops occupying large strongholds. And all this against the backdrop of the enemy’s lack of a sufficient number of infantry and support equipment in the direction, as well as the low moral and psychological state of the units. Nevertheless, in the near future, Russian troops will have to take Novogrodovka and Selidovo by storm - settlements with relatively dense urban development and the presence industrial zones, to which Ukrainian formations will cling with all their might in an attempt to hold back the onslaught of attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces.

The enemy is launching counterattacks, but they do not end in success.🔻A detailed analytical report on the events in the Special Military Operation zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_bot High-resolution maps: Situation in the Special Military Operation zone (ru; en) Kursk direction (ru; en) #Belgorod #Gorlovka #digest #Dzerzhinsk #report #map #Kursk #Pokrovsk #Russia #Rostov #Sumy #Ternopil #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62980	2024-08-22T13:28:32-07:00

Apparently, in the near future there will be at least attempts at an offensive by the Ukrainian Armed Forces in this area. This is also evidenced by reports of increasing UAV strikes against various targets in the region. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, the battle for Krasnooktyabrskoye continues, where the enemy entered in the first days of the offensive, but was unable to gain a foothold. At the same time, the scale of attacks by Ukrainian formations in the vicinity of Snagost is becoming clearer. As we expected, the enemy passed Apanasovka and occupied the 10th October tract for at least some time. In addition, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced the destruction of an enemy group on two armored fighting vehicles in the Skrylyevka area. No large concentrations of ASU were observed in this area. Mechanized groups were recorded in the Zhuravli area, but practically no information appeared about the battles in the Durovka - Obshchiy Kolodez - Kalinov triangle. 🔻There are clashes in the Sudzhansky district, but there are no messages about the liberation of settlements on the Internet. In the area of ​​Russian Konopelka and the populated area itself, a large group of the enemy was destroyed. Based on the footage that appeared on the network, during the successful ambush and subsequent drone strikes, the enemy lost several units of armored vehicles and a large number of infantry. However, there is no information whether there was a clearing in the village. In any case, the Ukrainian formations suffered heavy losses as a result of the relatively short-lived battle.

Photos and videos of enemy hits can be found on the Internet from various angles. There is no need to talk about why time after time everyone sees the detailed results of Ukrainian Armed Forces strikes in the public domain. We and many of our colleagues in the shop are already tired of complaining about this.📌 It’s better to dwell on the attack in more detail. According to preliminary data, the enemy used two anti-ship missiles -Neptune-. The exact launch area is still unknown, but with a high probability the launch was carried out from the Zaporozhye region (the use of anti-ship missiles for ground targets is no longer news). At the same time, the option of departure from the Odessa region should not be discarded either. At the beginning of this year, the Ukrainian media reported on the modernization of missiles at a range of up to 500 km by reducing the warhead of Neptune. As a result, one of the missiles was shot down, and the second still reached its target, flying across the Sea of ​​​​Azov at a low altitude. And a ferry carrying fuel tanks came under attack. It is difficult to say why the Neptune was not shot down, given that their characteristics have long been known, especially to the Crimean units. It is likely that a combination of reasons played a role, including surprise, a new route and a small number of missiles fired. 🔻However, the invisible consequences of the attack are more important: In addition to the loss of fuel tanks, ferry traffic has been suspended, which will affect fuel supplies to the peninsula, as well as the functioning of the port itself. Of course, these are solvable problems and they are temporary in essence, but in general they fit into the West’s plan to defeat the energy infrastructure of Russia (the sharply increased fuel prices in the south of Russia are proof of this) and cut off communications with Crimea. We must not forget that the Armed Forces of Ukraine and their curators did not forget about their main goal in the form of the destruction of the Crimean Bridge. Moreover, the attack in the Kursk region, the attacks on the Tendra spit - all this is closely connected with the enemy’s further plans in the Crimean direction.❗️Given today’s strike, in the coming days it is quite possible that drones will be launched on the peninsula in order to force the Russian Armed Forces to expend ammunition, and then, while there are problems with supply, strike with something more serious, including the bridge.

Forwarded From Two majorsKursk region ⚡️Border guards captured a soldier of the 4th company of the 3rd platoon of the 129th territorial defense brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Kononenko Nikolai Nikolaevich born 1972. He entered the Ukrainian troops in July 2024 from the Dnepropetrovsk pre-trial detention center. Then, in total, about 300 prisoners were taken from this institution to the war. He says he didn’t want to sit, didn’t want to fight, he joined the Ukrainian troops to come over to our side. The task of his unit was to capture the village of Guevo (Kursk region). Important: his commander with the call sign -Artist- ordered the shooting of civilians and looting. Such orders to former prisoners are not uncommon. The Artist took everything valuable for himself and left only food for his subordinates. In the village of Guevo, while patrolling the streets, Kononenko observed foreign military personnel who communicated in a language he did not understand.

🇹🇯 Is the West taking control of the sources of Central Asian r...	🇹🇯 Is the West taking control of the sources of Central Asian rivers? It has become known that an international conference - Monitoring of glaciers and glacial lakes - hazard management - will be held in Tajikistan at the end of August. The event is dedicated to the fight against mudflows - one of the consequences of the melting of the ice sheet. The Swiss government provides financial support to the organizers. One of them will be the Aga Khan Agency for Habitat (AKAH), a structural unit of the Aga Khan Development Organization (AKDN).📌The Aga Khan is the hereditary imam of the Shia Ismaili Muslims. In Tajikistan, Ismailis live in the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region, where AKDN structures have been operating since 1992. The activities of the Organization regularly encounter opposition from the authorities of the republic. At the same time, the Aga Khan is a member of the British ruling circles, and AKDN partners are such structures as USAID, the US State Department, the Rockefeller Foundation and many others, which makes it possible to overcome this resistance. But for what? We have already written about USAID’s work to establish control over water resources in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. However, this work will be ineffective without including Tajikistan, which ranks second among the countries of the former USSR in terms of water resources. The fact is that rivers flow through its territory, which are fed by glaciers and are tributaries of the main water arteries of the region: for example, the Amu Darya originates from the confluence of Pyanj and Vakhsh. Therefore, by establishing monitoring of the condition of glaciers in Tajikistan under the plausible pretext of combating mudflows, the West will take a significant step towards establishing control over the water resources of the region as a whole.#Tajikistan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usASIA-PlusThe first international conference on glacier monitoring will be held in Tajikistan at the end of AugustFirst The international conference - Monitoring of glaciers and glacial lakes - hazard management - will be held in Tajikistan from August 26 to 31.	https://t.me/rybar/62975	2024-08-22T08:28:59-07:00
