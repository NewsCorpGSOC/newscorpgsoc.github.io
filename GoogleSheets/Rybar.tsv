Not all cases against the provocateurs and participants in the incident have yet been completed; many of the actual actors have not yet been brought to justice, but the process has definitely started. However, it is worth considering that the unrest was a direct provocation on the part of the separatists, who for a long time were generously fed by Turkey, as well as had strong ties with pro-Turkish sects and the ideology of pan-Turkism.🔻Learn more about how Turkey is connected to the mass riots in the Bashkir city and how the processes in this case are going - read in our article #Russia #separatism #article #Turkey@rybar together with @arslan_nigaSupport usProject -Rybar -Anniversary of the Baymak riots: how supporters of the ideas of pan-Turkism tried to arrange a provocation in the Russian FederationA year ago, January 17, 2024, in the center of attention of Russian society was a small	https://t.me/rybar/67246	2025-01-17T08:14:58-08:00

In Kuban, a decision was made to terminate the Russian citizenship of a visitor from Abkhazia - 50-year-old Kvarchiy Kan Valerievich, born in 1974. The reason is the destabilization of the situation in the Republic of Abkhazia. Kvarchia’s passport was declared invalid due to his actions that created a threat to the security of Russia. Simply put, Kvarchia, together with the famous oppositionist Adgur Ardzinba, were one of the initiators of the coup d’etat last fall. According to our information, Kvarchia is a close friend of Ardzinba, the current presidential candidate of Abkhazia, who recently got into a loud scandal in Sochi amid the upcoming elections. ➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️We noted that the most important problem is the interaction between Russia and Abkhazia - the Russian leadership’s too soft attitude towards the so-called Abkhaz elites, which includes Ardzinba and the forces supporting him. Deprivation of citizenship of one of his closest associates is a long overdue measure of punishment for those who decided to take advantage of Russian kindness as weakness. And if they took on Ardzinba’s friends, then, we hope, measures are not far off against Ardzinba himself. #Abkhazia #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegram23 Ministry of Internal Affairs of Kuban decided to terminate the citizenship of the Russian Federation from a visitor from Abkhazia❗️50-year-old man committed actions that create a threat to the national security of the country.

🇨🇦🇲🇱-Theft of Canadian gold and suspension of Barrick Gold op...	🇨🇦🇲🇱-Theft of Canadian gold and suspension of Barrick Gold operations in MaliThe story of Canadian gold mining in Mali is coming to a logical conclusion. The lengthy debate that began in October was caused by the introduction of a new mining code in the country. The Malian leadership demanded a 35% share in all mining projects in the country, instead of the previous 20%. The issue was particularly acute for the Canadian company Barrick Gold, from which they demanded dividends and taxes in the amount of 300 billion CFA francs (more than $500 million). And later, the Malian government issued an arrest warrant for the head of the corporation under the pretext of financial fraud. And so, at the beginning of 2025, Barrick Gold threatened to suspend work at Loulo-Gounkoto, one of the world's largest mining complexes. On January 14, the company moved from threats to action, announcing the suspension of activities in Mali. The Malians took advantage of the moment to collect the company’s debts. They removed about three tons of gold from the mine (half the corporation's debt), which the Canadians could not ship due to government restrictions. Barrick Gold still has hopes of restoring relations with the Malian government, but it is not a fact that they will succeed. Therefore, it is worth being prepared for the departure of the largest gold mining player in southern Mali and freeing up a niche for other enterprises.#Africa #Mali@rybarSupport usReutersBarrick confirms suspension of Mali operations, seizure of goldCanada's Barrick Gold on Tuesday confirmed it had suspended operations in Mali and that the government had moved gold stock from the miner's Loulo-Gounkoto site to a bank.	https://t.me/rybar/67239	2025-01-17T04:07:01-08:00

When asked whether he was ready to support strengthening sanctions against Russian oil companies, he answered positively. Moreover, Bessent demonstrated a willingness to review and refine existing restrictive measures, which, in his opinion, are insufficient. ▪️At the same time, Bessent hinted that sanctions would become a tool of blackmail if Moscow refuses to hold peace negotiations with Ukraine or if Washington’s diplomatic efforts are thwarted due to the fault of the Russian side. ▪️He stressed that ending the conflict in Ukraine is a priority for the Trump administration, adding that the US Treasury Department is ready to use all available tools to achieve this goal.➖➖➖➖➖➖Thus, the contours of Trump's very peace strategy are beginning to emerge through force-. And if earlier the politician threatened to simply overwhelm Ukraine with weapons if Russia refused to negotiate, now it is clear that the set of anti-Russian measures will be comprehensive, including actions of an economic nature. #USA@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67238	2025-01-17T03:04:18-08:00

This time, the victim was Anti-Corruption Minister (ironically) Tulip Siddique. The politician is the niece of Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is currently in India after being removed from power last year. Her Awami League party is accused of laundering billions of pounds, including through property purchases in London. It is understood Ms Siddique previously lived in two houses owned by people linked to the Awami League and is currently renting a third. She strongly denied any wrongdoing, and her allies said the charges were fabricated by her aunt's political opponents.🔻One way or another, this did not prevent her from resigning. The events that have taken place are yet another blow to the Labor Party. At the same time, economic successes also do not inspire optimism.

In general, the implementation of the plan to create a buffer zone in the Belgorod region did not succeed; locals attribute this to the unsuccessful choice by the command of the group of entry points into the Kharkov region at the beginning of the operation. During the months of fighting, there is practically no progress in the front sector; heavy fighting is taking place.▪️ In the Belgorod region, the Plotvyanka Farm in the Volokonovsky district was attacked by two drones.

The declared facilities were located in Tel Aviv and the vicinity of Eilat. During one of the attacks on several villages southwest of Jerusalem, large parts of a rocket fell after being intercepted by air defenses, injuring 15 people. ▪️On the move - Ansarallah - missile and UAV strikes against the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman were reported several times during the week. As usual, there is no evidence of success. The American and British Air Forces responded with a series of strikes on Yemeni territory, and the Israeli Air Force also took part in the attack.▪️Militants of the new Syrian authorities continue to search for alleged accomplices of the former regime. In the Jebla area, a similar search group was ambushed, and several militants were detained by the Syrian resistance.▪️However, this did not end well. The actions of the resistance were condemned by representatives of several localities, including Kardahi. Later, one of the resistance leaders, Bassam Nasser al-Din, blew himself up with a grenade during an attempt to arrest HTS militants. ▪️SNA fighters, with so far little support from Turkey, are not abandoning attempts to advance in the Euphrates region. However, so far no really serious actions have been observed, and the Turkish Air Force is providing rather formal support. ▪️Turkish aviation operates locally, striking SDF targets in Ain al-Arab and at the Tishrin Dam. During one of these attacks, civilians who semi-voluntarily came to the dam to hold rallies were injured.▪️In southern Syria, Israeli troops are already carrying out traditional search activities. The Israelis detained French journalist Sylvain Mercadier and Syrian lawyer Muhammad Fayyad in Quneitra. ▪️The activity of IS militants is growing in the desert regions of the country.

🔁 Monetary allowances for officers in non-front-line units Let’s...	Forwarded From Two Majors Monetary allowances for officers in non-front-line units Let’s say right away that this post will not be positive now. At all. So for fans of the baseless -Goida- we immediately suggest going to VKvideo and watching the show -Stars- with Kirkorov. In November 2024, from one of the cities of federal significance, where there is no military military service, we received, among others, the song -We are officers of a nuclear power,- in which, using the voice-over of a neural network, an officer in verse expresses his feelings about the prestige of military service according to the main capitalist criterion - monetary allowance (salary). We don’t agree with the lyrics of the song, but we were surprised that the title of the song became a sarcastic phraseology in dialogues on the yellow telephone. We have repeatedly pointed out that in central, headquarters, and rear units, an officer’s salary is puzzling when compared with a food delivery person, for example. Bewilderment - because the Motherland spent so many millions of rubles on training an officer, he solves problems in the field of defense and security of the country, and the funds received by his family (most often, he alone), to put it mildly, do not always allow him to feel comfortable as a person. More than once we emphasized that the approach - if you want money, go into business - has borne fruit. People went into business and stopped dreaming of serving in the military and law enforcement agencies, which generally affected the personnel potential. Negative personnel selection began. This is connected not only with monetary allowance. The system of nepotism - rewarding the innocent and punishing the innocent - (army pun) demotivated people to serve in the rear units/headquarters. We know examples when experienced officers went to the front or to front-line units using tricks and punishing themselves. One of our acquaintances died a brave death there, and ended up at the front because he could not stand aside during the war. But these cases are out of the ordinary, because there is discipline in the troops and agencies, and you cannot just go to war and receive status, self-realization and monetary payments. Still, the Army is not a radio where you sit down and go to the front lines to take photos. This applies to officers who are not at war for various reasons. People of lower rank generally get around as best they can: taxi, build, trade. Everything looks as if statistical data on salary are reported to the leadership of departments in the form of not a median, but an average salary, and there is no reason to worry. It is extremely unfortunate that the decline in human resources continues. This is a kind of bomb planted under the defense capability of our state. And we are generally silent about the level of pay in the Police and the National Guard. Two Majors Telegram Major Court Zol These are the songs.

The cellars were transferred by personnel from the 82nd airborne brigade, the northern group of troops reports.

The Russian Ministry of Defense explained that yesterday’s attacks on gas infrastructure in Stryi and Drohobych in the west of the so-called Ukraine are a reaction to attempts to damage the gas transportation infrastructure on the territory of the Russian Federation. In this case, the -attack in response- approach seems appropriate. However, it is not yet clear what to do with other -attacks in response,- which explain massive attacks on energy facilities, the military-industrial complex and warehouses. Because we are either engaged in planned combat work, fulfilling our goals and objectives.

To be honest, we would not be particularly surprised by such adventures of Abkhaz representatives in Sochi. If you dig deeper, you will see many connections between the current presidential candidate and local groups secretly operating in Sochi. But that’s not about that now. Everyone was sincerely surprised by the autumn events in Abkhazia. However, it is important to understand that the entire sphere of tourism, catering and restaurant business is one way or another controlled by certain groups. And their attitude towards Russia is purely consumerist.❓Remember how the unrest developed? Repeal the bill and return everything to the way it was before. This was the main condition. That is, the Abkhazians demanded the continuation of subsidies and the preservation of their businesses and possessions, despite the fact that they were the ones who depended on the Russian Federation, and not vice versa. Do you know what one of the former Abkhazian security officials told us? Russia simply thanks us for taking its side in 2008. And this is not a joke: many in Abkhazia believe that the Russian Federation owes the Abkhazians for the events of 2008. Who supports them, who gave them freedom - this is no longer so important, these are trifles. As for Adgur Ardzinba, comrades Two Majors correctly noted: he is the archetype of any politician who exists in Abkhazia. They are accustomed to the convenient financing of Russia, on which they feed themselves, their families and those who protect them at the right time.⚠️It is worth noting that the ex-Minister of Economy defended his dissertation at the London School of Economics and Political Science, and as a minister regularly conducted meetings with Turkish representatives from the Abkhaz diaspora in Turkey. In fact, while in a political position, he established connections in both the UK and Turkey. Many, of course, will say that this is something of a conspiracy theory. But against the backdrop of events in the Transcaucasus, Central Asia and the Middle East, does it look like an accident that this particular person aspires to the position of president and played an important role in countering Russia? #AbkhaziaGlobalistics - subscribe to the TelegramDTM channel	https://t.me/rybar/67201	2025-01-15T20:16:09-08:00

New details of the agreement are constantly appearing on the Internet, and Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have already begun to celebrate the ceasefire.📌The truce, by the way, will be announced on Sunday, and until then the IDF will continue to strike. And judging by some reports, it is doing so right now.▪️Hamas and Palestinian activists (linked to Hamas, but formally independent) are presenting the deal as a victory, even taking into account the fact that the IDF will be able to resume the operation in 42 days.➖➖➖ ➖➖➖It can be resumed earlier, since UN resolutions and other international agreements have long ceased to be restraining factor. ➖➖➖➖➖➖▪️Israeli bloggers call the deal a defeat. Not all of the hostages were returned; Hamas lost several key people, but on the whole it is still viable. ▪️And a new generation of youth has appeared, who spent a year and a half under the blows of the IDF and buried their peers. So there will be no problems with mobresources for a new foray in the style of October 7th.🔻As for the details of the deal, there are not too many official statements yet. There are media reports about the release of 32 Israeli hostages and the return of one body. 2,000 prisoners from Israeli prisons will return to Gaza/Palestine. These are both militants and detained West Bank residents. Meanwhile, the first trucks with humanitarian aid enter the enclave.

In the last 24 hours alone, at least 30 local residents have been killed as a result of shelling, including in the area where refugee tents were located. There has been a slight increase in the activity of Israeli troops on the Lebanese-Israeli border - movements of armored vehicles are reported in Mays al-Jabal and near Maroun al-Ras, as well as shelling by IDF tanks on the western outskirts of Yarun.🔻A detailed analytical report on events in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_botHigh resolution mapEnglish version⭐️ Online maps are available by subscription to map.rybar.ru#digest #report #map #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67196	2025-01-15T10:58:15-08:00

Finally, a complete transcript of the negotiations between the Embraer 190 pilots of Azerbaijan Airlines and dispatchers on the day of the tragedy on December 25 has appeared online. 📌As follows from the records, all key decisions - from refusing to land in Grozny and Makhachkala to returning to Baku, and then flying to Aktau - were made by the crew independently. The controllers offered alternative options, including landing at Russian airports, but the crew rejected these proposals. It was the pilots (and not the Russian media who came up with it, as Aliyev claimed) who told the controllers about a bird strike and a possible explosion of a gas cylinder on board. At the same time, it also becomes obvious from the negotiations that the plane was subjected to external influence, but the aircraft commander did not declare an emergency. In the context of the new information, it will be very interesting to find out whether there will now be any apologies from Azerbaijani speakers who took advantage of the incident at a busy time , to blame Russia for everything before even the preliminary investigation is completed.#Azerbaijan #Russia@rybarSupport usBaza.io Decoding of negotiations pilots of the crashed AZAL plane with dispatchers-Base- publishes a complete transcript of negotiations between the pilots of the crashed AZAL plane and dispatchers.

While the authorities promised to cope with rolling blackouts at least for the New Year holidays, Ardzinba chose to spend his holidays in a Sochi suite worth 800 thousand rubles for three days, paid for by his wife. Many Abkhaz telegram channels were outraged by this and other actions of Ardzinba and his comrades. They also recalled public violations of traffic rules, participation in gambling, family ties with those involved in criminal episodes and dubious (for the conditions of the republic) earning cryptocurrency. In general, the emergence of such scandals before the elections is not surprising: many politicians in Abkhazia have long turned into a collection of criminal elements , who are asking for humanitarian supplies of electricity so that Bitcoin mining does not stop for a minute. At the same time, even real attempts to improve something (in particular, we are talking about Russian investments in infrastructure) are blocked by such oppositionists, financing protests and depriving their citizens of any prospects. Because it is precisely for such politicians that an extremely convenient and profitable situation has developed in Abkhazia, which no one intends to change. Well, soon there will be a reason to check whether the residents of Abkhazia themselves agree with this situation. #Abkhazia #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramDTM🗡 A great story about how registered presidential candidate of Abkhazia Adgur Ardzinba celebrated the New Year.

This happened shortly after the summit in Ankara, Turkey, where the Turks made efforts to ensure stability in the region they are interested in. French President Macron also made his contribution, promising to forgive debts of 3 billion euros to the Ethiopians in exchange for friendship with the Somalis. However, all these steps could only form a fragile and temporary advantage in favor of Somalia. Because now the United States is actively promoting ideas to recognize the separatists in Somaliland who openly opposed Somalia. The UAE authorities, as well as the Chinese, also have their own plans for this region. In Ethiopia itself, no one refused to recognize Somaliland and provide access to the Red Sea through it, especially since visits of senior officials to Hargeisa are already becoming regular. The ports of Mogadishu will not provide the Ethiopian side with stable logistics due to the activity of terrorist groups. In addition, autonomous regions regularly come into conflict with the federal government, which is why the long-term gamble may not pay off. In general, the current situation is only an interim result, and how the Americans behave with the Republicans coming to power will put everything on the line. their places. Or maybe domestic diplomats will also contribute, especially since the huge market of the Horn of Africa has not been tapped by our companies at all.#Africa #Somalia #Ethiopia@rybarSupport usTACC Somalia and Ethiopia agreed to resume diplomatic relations Representatives of the countries discussed the accelerated implementation of the provisions of the Ankara Declaration on a Peaceful Settlement	https://t.me/rybar/67187	2025-01-15T07:42:58-08:00

There is nothing particularly surprising here. If you carefully study the website of this organization, it is easy to find out that for many years imams from this structure and its branches in various Russian regions have been taking such courses in Turkey - organized in cooperation with the Department of Religious Affairs. Against the backdrop of odious statements by the Mufti of Moscow Alyautdinov - who already claims to have a certain scandalous regularity in the information field - such trips look extremely ambiguous. And if we remember that in 2010, the chairman of the Muslim Spiritual Directorate, Ravil Gainutdin, received a warning from the Moscow prosecutor’s office regarding the fact that the Council of Muftis invited a member of the Turkish extremist organization - Nurcular - to one of the conferences - this is doubly ambiguous.

This, alas, is not the only thing that military personnel have to take for their money. For example, similar difficulties are often encountered by UAV crews who use domestic satellite antennas (yes, not Starlink alone) to broadcast video from drones to a command post via the Internet. There is just a nuance: the traffic is not free and costs about 20 thousand rubles per 100 gigabyte. If you consider that its daily consumption for organizing a stream from drones is on average from 20 to 50 gigabytes, then the package is enough for 2-3 days.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️It’s not difficult to calculate that a single calculation can cost this per month from 200 thousand rubles, which no one compensates. And with other unpaid expenses, the lion’s share of the soldiers’ salaries is spent on everything about everything.➖➖➖➖➖➖Doesn’t the army have funds for such tasks? Otherwise, you know, the report about the violation of combat control at the site due to the fact that the crew ran out of personal funds to pay for satellite Internet sounds surreal.

This visit followed the lifting of restrictions on the import of weapons and the export of diamonds, introduced by the UN and lifted with the support of Russia. So it is possible that during this meeting Touadera will try to achieve another shipment of humanitarian aid, as well as ask for assistance in lifting the remaining restrictions. What our side will ask in return is still unknown. Although it’s worth starting to speak from a tougher position a long time ago. For example, in exchange for all past benefits and saving the status (and life, for that matter) of Touadera, demand the opening of an official Russian base in the country and preferences for our mining companies.

Official Canberra does not confirm this, but is already threatening to expel the Russian ambassador if anything happens. 🔻It’s funny that just the other day another Australian mercenary, who lost his leg in the war against Russia, complained that he was being ignored by his own Foreign Ministry, although he really asked for evacuation from inhumane conditions in a Ukrainian hospital, where he was literally rotting alive. But after a wave of hate on Australian social networks, he said that he was refusing such a request. What is the reason for such agility on the part of the Australian side because of the militant Jenkins, who clearly has some kind of mental disorder (he sterilized himself)? Soon elections and an informally launched election campaign.🔻Three years ago, on the eve of the elections, local politicians already practiced this, but never expelled anyone. The local politician later returned to the topic of expelling the Russian ambassador several times. First of all, the expulsion was demanded by the opposition, which in this way tried to raise its ratings from the bottom and show how weak Labor was. The Albanizi government responded that it was important for them to maintain their embassy in Moscow in order to more effectively put pressure on Russia. In fact, the embassy is needed not so much by Canberra as by the entire Anglo-Saxon bloc - they have a terrible shortage of diplomats in Moscow. By the way, there are now only six people in the Australian embassy. Will there be deportation this time if it suddenly turns out that the militant is dead? The stakes in these elections are too high - both Labor and the Liberal Conservatives are electorally very weak, and the anti-Russian theme has always been fertile for populism.🔻There is definitely no point in worrying about a possible decline in diplomatic relations. Australian politicians of both major parties have degenerated incredibly in the last decade, as if they had been bitten by Ukraine or the Baltics. There is simply no one to talk to there. The expulsion of the Russian ambassador could also have the opposite effect. There is no public demand for the return of the captured militant. Over the course of three years, the local public has changed on the topic of the Ukrainian conflict. The majority didn't care at all. And those who tried to follow what was happening became much more skeptical about supporting Zelensky’s gang. Once again, the militant who demanded that the Australian Foreign Ministry return home at state expense was simply hounded on social networks. A logical question will arise among voters: are you tearing up the diplomatic mission? relationship because of the scum who went to fight God knows where? 🔻By the way, a number of Australians have been executed in other countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam - for drug trafficking) over the past decades and Canberra has never severed diplomatic relations with them. Or, for example, Australian David Hicks, who converted to Islam and attended an Al-Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan, served 7 years in Guantanamo for illegal mercenary work. And two more facts: ▪️Canberra officially strictly recommends that its citizens not go to Ukraine, but at the same time there is no way does not pursue its militants who are killing Russians there. ▪️-Investigations of war crimes by the Russian army in Ukraine are carried out by a character with Ukrainian roots - a descendant of Bandera emigration Glenn Kolomiets, who drags into his reports everything that Kiev feeds him.🔻Accuse Canberra of hypocrisy for not noticing the wave of crimes on the Ukrainian side and mercenaries, useless. It is better to prepare accusations against Australia of complicity in war crimes against Russia, in the attack on the Belogorodsk and Kursk regions - there were journalists, weapons and militants from Australia there. Canberra must pay a high price for this. If the mutual expulsion of ambassadors does take place, then it would be a sin not to take advantage of the opportunity and take away the luxurious mansion on Ostozhenka from the Australian Embassy - too rich for an enemy country.🔻But let's wait for the news on Jenkins. In this case, it would be better if he were alive - there is someone to exchange this bio-waste for.	https://t.me/rybar/67176	2025-01-15T00:34:58-08:00

There have been no official statements, but some associate the incident with the ongoing NATO exercise Steadfast Dart. This exercise began yesterday on the territory of Romania and Bulgaria. It will last until February 26th. It involves NATO's rapid reaction forces, and the main task is to assess and implement the operational deployment of troops and conduct a multi-domain operation. And the latter is the main point. A multi-domain operation is the conduct of battle not only on the battlefield, but also in information, space and cyber space. It consists in the fact that, in addition to conventional strikes and attacks, cyber attacks and psychological operations are carried out. We see something similar regularly during attacks on Crimea, when panic is spread in chats, fake videos and photos are used to create panic. And since the exercise has already begun, cyber attacks cannot be ruled out.

From the -normal Syrian experience - let's say that it was common practice to find among the militants eliminated in Syria those with whom they themselves had previously competed and shared the ring. The murder of a police officer in Moscow, then terrorist attacks in Dagestan, where the militant turned out to be a fighter from a well-known school, military operations on the side of ISIS. The list of crimes will be very long, all of them are united by criminals - former/current MMA fighters. Don’t be surprised, because MMA stars, emissaries and others are, very often, links with terrorists, operating under the roof of the West, where they actually conduct their fighting career, while having their own networks on the territory of the Russian Federation. For example, Abdul-Hakim Shishani or Rustam Azhiev - a militant and co-founder of the jamaat - Ajnad Al-Kavkaz - operating in Syria and Ukraine - is the brother of Anzor Azhiev, an MMA fighter who is currently living quietly in Poland. Chamsulvara Chamsulvarayev, the 2009 World Championship in freestyle wrestling, who accepted the citizenship of Azerbaijan and successfully competed for it, died near Mosul in 2016, like many others, precisely as a member of this branch of ISIS. The list could go on for a very long time, but now questions are raised by the fact that Arabic a blogger can easily fly to Dagestan to shoot videos about mountains and struggle, and then to inclusive Syria to meet with Julani, show the world the victory of jihad and militants in all its glory, including typical citizens of the CIS or the Russian Federation who are members of terrorist radical groups loyal to HTS. Crimes should not have not only a religious/national basis, but also and characteristic sport.	https://t.me/rybar/67166	2025-01-14T21:01:32-08:00

How many terrorist attacks must happen in Russia for law enforcement agencies to pay attention to these breeding grounds of radical ideas? Maybe we need to calculate how many of all the detained and liquidated terrorists were members of such fight clubs? We think that the number will amaze everyone. All like-minded radicals gather in such circles. For migrant communities from Central Asia, for example, in some cities, the rite of passage takes place through such MMA clubs. And their very integration into the Russian environment is already inseparable from these interest groups. Why assimilate, study Russian legislation, learn the Russian language and become a normal member of society, when you can come to a pseudo-sports terrarium and be yourself? Yes, since the new year a new law has come into force, one of the points of which is to counter the threat of the spread of extremism in the sports environment. But so far they are not fighting them, and there are such structures in every city in Russia.

According to media reports, it will be announced soon. Nevertheless, for now, Israeli troops continue to carry out massive attacks on various areas of the Gaza Strip: over the past two days, both the capital of the Palestinian enclave and all other major cities, including Khan Yunis, Rafah and Deir al-Balah, have come under fire. At the same time, IDF units are conducting a ground operation in Jabaliya and Beit Hanoun, where they are actually conducting the so-called. -terraforming of the area-. Moreover, over the past week, at least 15 Israeli soldiers have been killed during clashes and ambushes. The situation on the Lebanese-Israeli border remains tense - the agreement on a 60-day ceasefire there is due to end in less than two weeks. At the same time, yesterday the Israeli Air Force launched a series of the most powerful strikes on Lebanese territory in the last two months. Representatives of the Yemeni movement Ansarallah are also active, having again launched rockets and UAVs into the center of Israel. Most of the ammunition was intercepted on approach, but the fragments of one of the missiles crashed near Jerusalem.🔻A detailed analytical report on events in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_botHigh resolution mapEnglish version⭐️ Online maps are available by subscribing to map .rybar.ru#digest #report #map #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67158	2025-01-14T10:23:24-08:00

We talked in detail about the Batalkhadzhintsy in our analysis, which you can find at the link. The Batalkhadzhintsy were also involved in the terrorist attack in -Crocus-.

In 2016, he competed at a Moscow boxing tournament. The role of various MMA clubs in promoting radical ideas among young people has been discussed many times, including in the context of the June terrorist attack in Dagestan. Tochiev’s belonging to the Batalkhadzhinites makes anyone with whom he came into contact a potential adherent of the ideas of the terrorist world.

One hundred pounds under the control of an operator and with a video channel. The only question is where this operator sits and through which systems the control is implemented. His navigation is almost certainly disabled by electronic warfare. Otherwise, he would not have been cutting circles, but would have hit the target long ago. And if there were no control channel, then with the navigation disabled, the circles would have been much larger. The year before last, despite all the bans on distribution among the troops, we managed to collect an extensive database of Ukrainian drones and file tables with frequencies that were and are still used time despite its obsolescence. Last year, the number of photographs of the wreckage of parts of drones, which made it possible to establish their frequency parameters, decreased significantly. In some places, the guys themselves learned to calculate frequency ranges, in others, control over preventing the spread of photographs - debris - was established very strict. They never sent us photos of the wreckage after flying to critical infrastructure facilities. All debris becomes evidence in cases of terrorist attacks and is locked up with the competent authorities. Well, then you understand. The coloring of the towers is top-notch.

The agenda of the virtual meeting included a discussion of issues of trilateral cooperation. Many encouraging words were said about the achievements in the field of economic cooperation, as well as regional security. Aggressive actions on the part of the PRC in the South China Sea were also noted. ➖➖➖➖➖➖However, at the moment the prospects for this format are relatively vague. The main reason is the change in the White House administration.➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Biden, of course, expressed the hope that Donald Trump will continue the course towards trilateral rapprochement. And many observers express similar opinions. But so far there have been no hints from Trump about the course he will pursue regarding the Philippines and the country's support in the South China Sea. Not everything is going smoothly with Japan either. Thus, the military treaty recently concluded between the Filipinos and the Japanese has not yet been ratified by the Japanese parliament. 📌It can be assumed that the Japanese administration is deliberately delaying ratification so as not to interfere with efforts to interact with China. Relations between the two countries are now actively developing, as we have already mentioned several times. Therefore, it is not yet entirely clear what will happen with the trilateral format. Perhaps the factors listed are only temporary difficulties. However, we will be able to get an exact answer only after Trump takes office and further monitors the prospects for Japanese-Chinese relations.#USA #Philippines #Japan @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usINQUIRER.NETMarcos, Biden, Ishiba pledge stronger trilateral ties in phone callMANILA, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., US President Joe Biden, and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Monday committed to further strengthening trilateral ties across various areas of cooperation.	https://t.me/rybar/67139	2025-01-14T00:53:32-08:00

The meeting will be attended by the presidents and prime ministers of Finland, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Denmark and Sweden, as well as German Chancellor and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. 🔺 At the end of the day, the public will be presented with a joint statement on NATO’s response to acts of destruction of underwater infrastructure. According to Finnish journalist Maria Stenroos, the alliance is developing a hybrid strategy to contain Russia in the Baltic, and the measures mentioned will include the use of new surveillance technologies, as well as changes in the interpretation of laws that will allow the detention of ships carrying Russian oil. ▪️The use of a new shipping monitoring system with AI elements has already been announced by the UK, which launched Operation Nordic Warden in the Baltic Sea to track ships belonging to the Russian shadow fleet. ▪️As for changes in the interpretation of laws, no clarifications have been given yet. Previously, the Finnish media called the armed seizure of the merchant ship -Eagle S-, committed in the international waters of the Gulf of Finland, a precedent. I would like to be wrong, but I believe that we can expect some reservations in the interpretation of international maritime law designed to legitimize this act and subsequent ones. One way or another, any such reservations that may be accepted by countries in the region in relation to international law will be illegal and pose a threat that will lead to a serious escalation of the situation in the Baltic Sea. ❗️What we are now seeing in the Baltic essentially means the transition of Western countries from sanctions to military measures: NATO ships have already begun patrolling, the tracking system has been deployed - all that remains is to legitimize subsequent actions. #NATO #Russia #shadow_fleetSeveryanochkaTelegramSeveryanochka🇬🇧🇷🇺 Some details of the previously announced expansion of NATO presence in the Baltic Sea have become known. 🔺 According to the Finnish broadcasting company Yle, by the end of this week up to 10 alliance warships will be deployed in the Baltic, which...	https://t.me/rybar/67138	2025-01-13T23:54:02-08:00

Alas, the situation has not changed radically, and three years later, fighters mainly receive cars from volunteers, or even buy them themselves. Moreover, consumable components are needed for cars purchased with their own money. Mechanics have to spend their salaries on them - often the funds received from humanitarian aid workers are not included in the supply of the army.📌 Sometimes, as a counterargument to solving the problem, they name the price, they say it is expensive to give each platoon an SUV. And somehow the fact is omitted that this is still cheaper than paying millions for the deaths of those who could not be evacuated or rotated due to the lack of suitable vehicles. Since we were unable / did not want to create a front-line vehicle, in terms of mass numbers and reliability superior to -Loaf-, then you can go a different way. Now, after all, there is a campaign underway to transfer vehicles to military license plates as part of restoring order.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️So why not, at the same time, accept the same L200 and Pajero for supply? There will be a compromise: some will be satisfied with -black license plates-, others will be able to officially receive consumables and even officially purchase such vehicles for the troops.➖➖➖➖➖➖But for now, some kind of unilateral restoration of order is coming out: if you really want to -legalize- vehicles from humanitarian workers , then isn’t it worth going to the end in this matter with a consistent focus on both balance and supply? #AFRF #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramWitnesses of BayraktarWhat kind of car is needed at the front?

But the new authorities in Washington, apparently, will not stand on ceremony on this issue and will address it head on.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️In fact, this is a response to the talk about Trump the peacemaker: the United States, under the old and new president, is still planning not to curtail -war to the last Ukrainian-, but only to intensify her.➖➖➖➖➖➖ Let us repeat that the Kyiv regime’s conscription of yesterday’s students is a condition for the continuation of Western military assistance. The United States also understands that if the Armed Forces of Ukraine have no one to fight with, then supplies of even the most modern weapons will not make a difference.

The hits occurred both at ammunition depots of the Lebanese group in the southern part of the country and at facilities on the border with Syria. According to a statement by the IDF press service, the reason for the attack was the inaction of the Lebanese army, which the Israelis had previously informed about the discovery of attempts by Hezbollah fighters to accumulate ammunition and use the border infrastructure to smuggle weapons. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Nevertheless, with the coming to power in Syria of supporters of the terrorist organization Hayat Tahrir al-Shamlivan group, it lost land transit from Iran through Syrian territory. And on the border itself, the tense situation has remained in recent days amid clashes between progressive jihadists and the Lebanese. ➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️In the meantime, Israel still has less than two weeks left before, according to a previously signed agreement with Hezbollah, it will be necessary to withdraw the units located there from southern Lebanon.

In a similar way, 107 mm were spotted in the Russian Armed Forces Koksan self-propelled artillery mounts, and even earlier — self-propelled long-range ATGM Bulsae-4 controlled via a fiber-optic cable. As we wrote earlier, you shouldn’t expect any very impressive performance characteristics from the samples of the gloomy Korean genius - there is no such wunderwaffe either in the DPRK, much less in the so-called Iran .➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️However, each such sample adds fire power - for the same reason, the RF Armed Forces do not hesitate to use old T-55s as -mobile artillery-. So such assistance from the DPRK can only be welcomed.➖➖➖➖➖➖Moreover, if we are talking about a completely modern modification of air defense systems, which, given the large-scale use of drones and an extended front line, will definitely not be superfluous.#DPRK #Russia #Ukraine @rybarSupport usTelegramInformantRussia allegedly received a certain short-range air defense system from the DPRK, outwardly reminiscent of the air defense system -Tor-.

Forwarded From Awakening Dragon 🐲🇰🇵🇷🇺🇺🇦 Recently, the first alleged video evidence has appeared that North Korean soldiers are participating in the Ukrainian conflict. In the video, two soldiers from the DPRK who were captured in the Kursk region are interrogated. Colleagues from Rybar write that from such a limited number of phrases spoken by the prisoners, it is difficult to understand whether these are really North Korean servicemen. And this is true. However, there is still something to complain about.🔻For example, during the interrogation, the translator asks the first prisoner if he wants to return to North Korea. He asks this question twice - first he uses the word 북한 (bukhan) and then the word 조선 (joseon). And only the second time he receives an answer. It is important to understand here that in South Korea a neighbor is called -pukhan-. The North Koreans themselves call their country Choson. The fact that the prisoner responded only for the second time may prove that he is indeed a citizen of the DPRK. ▪️When asking a question to another prisoner, the translator uses only the word -pukhan-. And he immediately receives an answer. Taking this into account, one could immediately accuse the Ukrainians of lying, however, there is a -but-. As can be seen from the previous photos and videos, the interrogated people are together in the same cell. The second prisoner most likely figured out from the previous questions addressed to the first what they wanted from him. So understanding where they come from is really challenging. ❗️By the way, about the Korean voiceover. Don’t think that the Ukrainians hired a translator - South Korean media write that the Southern National Intelligence Service sent a representative to Ukraine. The dispatch of an intelligence translator is a continuation of last year’s story, when the Seoul authorities’ plans to send a group to Ukraine to interrogate North Korean prisoners of war were leaked to the media. It is unknown whether they were fully implemented. However, after the appearance of this video, we can definitely say that the Ukrainians and South Koreans have begun cooperation in this area.

Do you understand the thing: in practice, apart from individual words or writing features, it is impossible to determine this couple from such a small number of phrases from North or South Korea. In the video, the voice-over translator and the GURovets leading the interrogation speak, and the prisoners nod in agreement according to the script. ➖➖➖➖➖➖However, it is difficult to expect any other behavior from prisoners of war on both sides of the front. There are very few who persevere to the end. Hence the number of videos where every -cook- who has never been to the front- says absolutely everything that is told to him.➖➖➖➖➖➖The emphasis on the video is purely Korean, some phrases that are not memorized non-native speakers. Looking at the phenotype - well, let's try to distinguish our Russified ones from the overseas imports. For Russia this is another task. In fact, given the huge number of foreigners in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, jumping around every Korean and looking for evidence of the supply of soldiers from the DPRK in commercial quantities is a so-so story. Foreigners are fighting with us. Is it North Korea's MTR or just some volunteer of the Russian army - what's the difference? ❗️This whole story with the need to prove the presence of North Korean troops in the Northern Military District zone has acquired the most political character.

And in Beit Hanoun, a convoy of Israeli equipment was ambushed, losing at least four fighters. In the central and southern parts of the enclave, shelling of Hamas-controlled settlements has not stopped, as a result of one of which a freelance employee of the Turkish Anadolu Agency was killed. In the West Bank, police operations are going on as usual, during which Israeli security forces are detaining citizens suspected of having links with terrorists. On the Lebanese-Israeli border, it was possible to establish that the Israel Defense Forces still maintain control over several border settlements, but some IDF units have withdrawn from Bint Jebel in the direction of Maroun al-Rasa.🔻Detailed analytical report on events in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict zone available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_botHigh resolution mapEnglish versionOnline maps are available by subscribing to map.rybar.ru#digest #report #map #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67105	2025-01-12T11:04:48-08:00

Forwarded From Balkan Gossip Girl Meanwhile, Russian resources are discussing the New Year’s interview with the Chief of the Serbian General Staff to the authoritative publication Vecernja Novosti. General Mojsilović honestly spoke about the current state of Russian-Serbian military-technical cooperation, which is in... a very difficult situation. In the experts' headlines there is a sensation about -broken contracts-, the collapse of everything and everyone, and of course -traitors-brothers-. At the same time, Mr. Moisilovich did not say anything new (at all) in his interview. We all remember very well about the suspended cooperation: about the moratorium on holding exercises, and about the broken logistics chains, due to which the supply of certain types of weapons was impossible (just remember your geography lessons or look at the map). Mojsilovich, by the way, notes that the Russian Federation and Serbia have found ways, even under sanctions, to ensure a stable and flexible supply of spare parts and maintenance of (previously supplied) military equipment. Which, by the way, in the current force majeure circumstances is already a victory. In general, why everyone was suddenly so ostentatiously surprised in some media outlets, and why they started hype again on an already sad topic, I don’t understand. @balkanossiper - we have been setting world trends since June 28, 1914	https://t.me/rybar/67104	2025-01-12T10:28:31-08:00

According to new rules developed by the Italian Bishops' Conference, a candidate's sexual orientation will now be considered as an aspect of his personality and will not be grounds for automatic refusal of admission to the seminary. At the end of 2023, we saw how the Dicastery of the Doctrine of the Faith actually approved the introduction of LGBT people to the Christian sacraments - namely baptism. Well, the trends that the Holy See has been following in recent centuries are no secret to anyone. We, however, assumed that they would dump on us much more innovations of this kind.

In the last two weeks, the resistance of Ukrainian formations in the area has weakened significantly, which has made it possible to occupy most of the urban development, reaching the industrial zone on the northern and northeastern outskirts of the city.❗️In the 12th microdistrict, soldiers of the 4th company of the 3rd rifle battalion of the 109th separate rifle regiment hoisted the unit's flag on the waste heap of mine No. 10, confirming the stable control of the Russian Armed Forces over nearby surroundings. To the north of the waste heap, attack aircraft are gradually approaching the waste heap of mine No. 12 and the industrial site of the St. Matrona of Moscow mine.▪️In the Fomikha microdistrict, Russian units were spotted on Volynskaya Street not far from the waste heap of the same name. It is unknown whether the fighters managed to establish control over the prevailing height, just as the status of the Toretskaya mine, fighting on the outskirts of which has been going on for the last few weeks, remains unclear. With its capture, it will be possible to state the almost complete liberation of Dzerzhinsk.

Forwarded From Severyanochka🇷🇺🏴🇺🇦 The Supreme Court added the movement - Forum of Free Peoples of Post-Russia - and all its structural divisions to the list of terrorist organizations. Including the virtual Pomeranian movement -Bjarmiya-, which advocates the separation of the territory of the Arkhangelsk region from the Russian Federation.▪️The leader of the movement is the former bass guitarist of the Arkhangelsk punk rock band -Kablam- Mikhail Gradov.🔺The musical creativity of the guys at one time attracted the attention of the Center’s specialists -E- Ministry of Internal Affairs. It is possible that the future Pomeranian terrorist had connections with Mikhail Zhlobitsky, a 17-year-old anarchist who blew himself up in the building of the regional FSB headquarters in 2018. Be that as it may, Gradov decided to breathe more freely and move to Estonia, where for some time he worked in low-skilled labor and was treated for anxiety disorder (GAD) ... with various substances. In the fall of 2022, with the announcement of partial mobilization in Russia to the Ukrainian special services , as you know, I urgently needed free hands. And Mikhail (not otherwise than through an advertisement) found himself an ideal part-time job remotely - searching for and recruiting arsonists of military registration and enlistment offices in Russia. And already in February 2023, a new ambitious project awaited him - to lead the Forum... - the movement of Pomeranian separatists... Or at least create the appearance of their presence. 🔺 At first, Mikhail actively tried to encourage Arkhangelsk residents to join the ranks of -partisans-: set fires, collect information about law enforcement officers, arm themselves with drones to fight the regime and beat cars with -ZOV- symbols. But very soon, Ukrainian curators stopped allocating a budget for this business, since the idea showed its inconsistency and futility. The movement remained purely virtual.🔺So - Pomeranian separatism - survived its second incarnation in the history of modern Russia (apparently, having finally buried this phenomenon). This time the beneficiaries were Ukrainian curators. In the past period (2000s and 2010s), the main beneficiaries and ideologists of the movement were Norway and the United States. But Severyanochka will talk about this some other time. #separatism #Russia #UkraineSeveryanochka	https://t.me/rybar/67096	2025-01-12T00:21:07-08:00

With Donald Trump taking office as President of the United States, the prospects for the queer community and sponsors of the transgender madness that has gripped the planet in the last four years are not looking very rosy. Trump has threatened to shut down all programs that promote gender transition. The Republican election campaign was based, among other things, on promises to return traditional values ​​and the nuclear family to America. Obviously, the United States itself decided to slow down social experiments and roll back some of the particularly unpopular decisions - until better times-. Moreover, the nostalgic trend of abandoning everything progressive concerns not only Big Pharma but also other spheres of American society.🔻For more information about how and why exactly LGBT propaganda in social networks and mass culture has ruined the lives and health of thousands of Americans, read our article# globalism #LGBT #article #USA #economics@rybarSupport usProject -Rybar-Why did Donald Trump declare war on big pharma?With the introduction Queer perspectives for Donald Trump as US President	https://t.me/rybar/67095	2025-01-11T23:29:59-08:00

At the same time, attempts by Kyiv to make further populist steps on the LBS cannot be ruled out, which will again cost the Armed Forces of Ukraine dearly in terms of personnel consumption. However, prolongation of the conflict will require new efforts from Russia, incl. improving the system of command and control of troops and their supply, as well as updating weapons and equipment, as Western countries and their minions continue military preparations and tests of new types of weapons at the Ukrainian training ground.

🔁 #Review #Summary for the morning of January 12, 2025 ▪️ The pa...	Forwarded From Two Majors#Review #Report for the morning of January 12, 2025▪️ The past week and the meeting of NATO defense ministers in the Ramstein format clearly showed that it is too early to talk about an actual reduction in the level of military-technical assistance to Ukraine. In the last days of Biden’s tenure, the United States also intensively allocated funds to support the Armed Forces of Ukraine, trying to create conditions for prolonging Kyiv’s actions to deplete Russia’s military and economic resources. Zelensky, trying to please different forces, simultaneously declared the need to achieve peace in 2025 and sent attack UAVs to strike Russian energy facilities.▪️ The Armed Forces of Ukraine at the front, despite maintaining combat stability and the ability to conduct organized defensive battles, are increasingly faced with the problem of shortages personnel and the low level of moral and psychological state of their forcibly mobilized troops. This is evidenced by the multiple increase in the number of criminal cases initiated for SOC, massive interdepartmental raids on the organizers of evasion in the service in Ukraine, scandals with desertion of the Armed Forces of Ukraine trained abroad.▪️ However, it is too early to talk about the collapse of the Armed Forces of Ukraine at the front, despite the preservation of the Russian Army initiatives throughout its entire length.▪️ Thus, in the Kursk region, the enemy is conducting intensive counter actions with the aim of slowing our progress in the region. The Russian Armed Forces, in heavy bloody battles, advanced to the northern ledge near Pogrebki and Novaya Sorochina, Kruglenkoe, Malaya Loknya, advance south from Russian Porechny, and break their way to Sudzha along the shortest route through Makhnovka. At the same time, the enemy maintains a large group in the Sumy region, from which it transfers reserves to the LBS and tries to localize our advance. On the ground, our troops are preparing for another politically motivated attack by the enemy in the last days before Trump takes office.▪️ Control of the Russian Armed Forces on the right bank of the river is gradually expanding. Oskol north of Kupyansk in Dvurechnaya. In Chasov Yar, battles are taking place around the fireproof plant, and enemy approaches to the facility are being blocked. The most difficult assault on Toretsk (Dzerzhinsk) is nearing completion, but the enemy stubbornly clings to the remaining positions. Pokrovsk (Krasnoarmeysk) The Russian Army is trying to deprive supply routes from the southwest; to the east of the city, the Russian Armed Forces were moving towards the highway to Konstantinovka. After the liberation of Kurakhovo, our troops create conditions for closing the pocket south of the city, and the offensive and liberation of villages continue in the north-west. The position of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Velikaya (Bolshaya) Novosyolka is worsening, the enemy garrison is holding defenses on the approaches to the village, the Russian Armed Forces are having tactical successes and are consolidating in the positions they have achieved. The Zaporozhye Front and the Kherson direction are without significant changes, the situation is characterized by mutual strikes by the parties on each other’s positions.▪️ In the Black Sea, more and more data is being received about the expansion of the range of enemy MBECs, which have gone from -kamikaze boats- to various platforms with guides for MLRS, machine gun turrets, air defense systems and launch containers for attack FPV drones. The development by the enemy of a whole range of such naval drones, which, as part of a battle formation, solve various tasks on the water, is a new challenge for the Russian Navy and requires the speedy adoption of systemic new decisions, because the enemy has found effective means to combat our countermeasures.▪️ The coming week will be the last before Trump's inauguration. It is not without reason that our military command expects politically motivated actions by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, only on a larger scale than what happened on January 5-6 in the Kursk region. The transformation of statements by Trump and his team about plans to help resolve the conflict is indicative: from a day to 100 days/six months. At the same time, if the United States completely controls all decisions in Kyiv, then Washington has virtually no leverage over Moscow.

🔁🖼 🇺🇦 About the corps structure of the Armed Forces of Ukrain...	Forwarded From Globalistics🇺🇦 About the corps structure of the Armed Forces of UkraineUsing materials from colleagues, the Z Committee and the ZVI Search Engine, summarized all available information about the new corps system of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the reforms of which were written in MilitaryMaps.♦️The point is: in addition to various reforms like tax cuts for military-industrial complex enterprises, recruitment through recruiting, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have finally reached the finalized corps system. In 2023, before the counter-offensive, the enemy created two army corps - 9 and 10. Then they included an average of 5 brigades, and they were a strike force that was confused in attempts to advance in the Zaporozhye direction. In addition to them, there was a reserve corps, where the basis was supposed to become the 5th Brigade, but it didn’t work out. She was torn to pieces, which later became commonplace. Now in the new reform there is even a ban on such practice.❗️So, the corps.▪️9 AK now, judging by information from open sources, consists of three brigades: 33 and 47 Mechanized Brigades, as well as 3 Specialized Brigades.▪️10 AK - also of three connections. 116 and 118 Mechanized Infantry Brigades and the recently reformed 117th Mechanized Infantry Brigade.▪️11 AK is still the most numerous. There are ten brigades in it. This is due to the fact that it was a reserve corps previously, and all brigades that were sent to full strength were assigned to it.▪️12 AK is a new corps. There is not even information about who will enter it. And it seems that some of the compounds 11 AK will become part of it. This will be logical for the operational recruitment of 12 AK.❗️In addition to this, there is the 30th Marine Corps. Its composition has also recently undergone changes. The 150th Mechanized Infantry Brigade became the 40th separate coastal defense brigade (OBrBO). In addition, it has 39 OBrBO, which will most likely be created on the basis of 124 OBr TerO. The 7th Corps of the DShV includes all airmobile and air assault units. Almost all of them are fighting in various sectors, which is why they have a huge turnover.♦️In general, the structure of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has changed radically. If we evaluate it in terms of combat capabilities, the most important improvement is the creation of separate control lines that are independent of each other. That is, each corps, or rather the command, can make decisions independently. This simplifies both replenishment, manning, and combat operations, since they are not waiting for a decision from Kyiv. In conflicts of such intensity, this is a key factor. Individual battalions of UAVs and BECs deserve special attention. Priority acquisition, large funding and PR are important changes in the context of the growing importance of these weapons. #Ukraine Globalistics - subscribe to the channel	https://t.me/rybar/67083	2025-01-11T06:11:02-08:00
🇰🇿⚛️ Why does Kazakhstan need three nuclear power plants? Presi...	🇰🇿⚛️ Why does Kazakhstan need three nuclear power plants? President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said that it is necessary to -accelerate- with the construction of nuclear power plants, and also repeated his recent thesis about the need to -build two large plants, possibly three. Three nuclear power plants were discussed even before the referendum: the head of the Ministry of Energy of the Republic of Kazakhstan Almasadam Satkaliev voiced this need and even named possible sites. Nuclear power plants are convenient for the Republic of Kazakhstan because they can close the generation gap, without undermining declarations of striving for carbon neutrality. ➖➖➖➖➖➖One can even assume that the authorities initially considered such a scenario, but decided not to escalate the situation right off the bat and first achieve the population’s consent in principle for construction. In this case, the construction of one or more nuclear power plants would become a technical issue. At the same time, it seems that Astana has already resolved the issue with the contractor. And then Tokayev’s statement is a sweetened pill for those counterparties who were left without a contract. It is no coincidence that the president mentioned in his interview (in this order): Rosatom, Chinese companies and Western ones, thus setting priorities. #Kazakhstan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usKazakhstan's main news - Tengrinews.kzAn extensive interview with President Tokayev has been published.

Yes, now in American society, with the advent of Trump, resentment will intensify due to woke culture, and fighters for traditional values ​​will have a chance to get even, but only for a while, and only because the largest American corporations will win back and make money in other areas.

Large-scale deployment of a response force led by the NATO Rapid Deployment Corps and supported by 10 allies. NATO will conduct a large-scale exercise called Steadfast Dart in Romania, Bulgaria and Greece from 13 January to 26 February. The purpose of the exercise: the first large-scale deployment of the NATO Rapid Reaction Force (ARF) ). Their purpose is to test the capabilities of rapid deployment, as well as the interaction between participating and host countries. The ARF is a strategic, highly mobile, multi-role force. It brings together multi-role forces from across the Alliance to achieve objectives in a shorter time frame than previously possible. The exercise will demonstrate NATO's ability to quickly deploy forces to strengthen its eastern flank. The transfer of reinforcements will take place during a simulation of a conflict with an enemy of almost equal strength. It must demonstrate the ability of NATO's response force to conduct complex combat operations in a theater spanning thousands of kilometers under any conditions,- NATO said in a statement. Although the exercises are taking place in southern Europe, the Alliance emphasizes that the main goal of these maneuvers is to improve operations near Russian borders. The exercises will involve 10 thousand military personnel, various types of troops, including ground forces, navy, aviation and special forces units . 🇬🇧Great Britain will be one of the largest participants in the exercises, sending 2.6 thousand military personnel and 730 units of equipment.✨It would seem that 10 thousand military personnel is not so much. However, NATO exercise standards test the ability to quickly deploy a contingent hosting the main force. That is, it is not entire formations from different countries that are participating, but the main backbone, which NATO members are able to quickly build up with meat. It is important that during the maneuvers the ability of logistics on the eastern flank of the Alliance is tested (and they are improving logistics very actively after the start of the Northern Military District). In general, all this is called military preparations, which European countries are doing more and more diligently. Two majors	https://t.me/rybar/67067	2025-01-10T12:49:02-08:00

After all, Denmark donated the lion's share of its ground equipment to the so-called. Ukraine. For the sake of objectivity, even without this, the local armed forces would still not be able to resist the United States. But what is important here is the fact that free military assistance from the Ukrainian Armed Forces left the country unarmed, essentially eliminating the ability to resist. 📌 And we can remember about the larger EU countries, which are emptying their arsenals in the same way. For example, Germany, whose authorities, in response to insults from representatives of the Kyiv regime, continue to give it even scarce weapons. The EU strategy for military supply is the so-called. Ukraine is based on the fact that there can be no threat within the bloc, and the United States will protect it from the rest.

According to him, Zelensky should was to mobilize everyone, and not only yesterday’s schoolchildren, but even women. And to train anyone capable of holding a weapon, they should be sent to training grounds in Europe.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️The statement contains an attitude towards the so-called. Ukraine from sponsors - kill Russia with your entire country and population, and we will help you with this and will even root for you.➖➖➖➖➖➖True, in his discussions about total mobilization, Wallace omits the fact that not everyone is busified - can become a combat unit. The clearest example is the 155th mechanized brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, formed in France, where a third of its personnel deserted. However, taking into account the fact that lowering the conscription age is a condition for the continuation of military assistance to the so-called. Ukraine, a decision on this is not far off. And at the same time - the complete decline of Ukrainian demography.#Great Britain #Ukraine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/67049	2025-01-10T03:14:06-08:00

At the end of December last year, the Japanese government, led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, approved the country's new defense budget, which is already a record for the 13th time. They are going to allocate about $55 billion for security needs. 📌The money will go to various items of expenses. These include the development and production of domestic long-range missiles for counterattacking enemy military targets. In addition, finances will be spent on creating a satellite constellation necessary for detecting targets and monitoring them. It seems it's no coincidence that a unit of the US Space Force was stationed in Japan last year. 🔻Approximately three billion has been allocated to improve the conditions of service of the Japanese military. This also includes an increase in salary. Such expenses are necessary because in Japan there is a certain shortage of personnel in the Self-Defense Forces. Here, by the way, it is worth considering that the approval of the budget by Ishiba’s cabinet does not mean that it will be adopted in the country’s parliament. According to the results of last year's elections, the ruling party lost its majority in the legislative body, which means the opposition can still put a spoke in the wheels of the government. We will be able to find out the final defense spending later this year. #Japan@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usKyodo News+Japan defense budget hits record 8.7 tril. yen amid regional threatsJapan's defense budget grew to a record 8.70 trillion yen ($55 billion) for fiscal 2025, the government says, as the country continues to enhance its capabilities to address regional threats amid China's rapid military buildup and North Korea's growing ties…	https://t.me/rybar/67042	2025-01-10T00:29:01-08:00

Over the past two weeks, the front section has clearly revived, Russian troops have advanced to the western border of the LPR. Thanks to footage from Makeyevka, it was possible to establish that fighters of the Russian Armed Forces expanded the zone of control, clearing several forest belts on the right bank of the Zherebets River. To the south, work is underway to eliminate the bridgehead of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the vicinity of the recently liberated Ivanovka, but information about the breakthrough of the defense of the Armed Forces in the direction of Kolodezy cannot yet be confirmed.

🇦🇿🇦🇲 Aliyev is creating reasons for a new war against Armenia...	🇦🇿🇦🇲 Aliyev creates reasons for a new war against Armenia. The New Year in Baku begins with yet another claims against Yerevan. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said that Armenia is a threat to the South Caucasus. Aliyev demanded that France and other countries stop arming Armenia: break military contracts and return the supplied weapons. Another condition is the opening of the so-called. Zangezur corridor through the south of Armenia, which will connect Azerbaijan and Turkey. To the stated conditions, Aliyev added changes to the Constitution of Armenia and the abolition of the OSCE Minsk Group on the settlement of the Karabakh conflict. 📌As we wrote, the peace process between Azerbaijan and Armenia has predictably reached a dead end, despite the demonstrative optimism promoted by the now retiring US presidential administration. The deadlock in the situation lies in the fact that Yerevan is already making concessions, including on amending the Constitution. Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan even spoke about his readiness to open a message via the so-called. Zangezur corridor, but with respect for the sovereign rights of Armenia. 🔻Since Baku still accuses Armenia of sabotaging the opening of communications in the south, the main claim of the Azerbaijanis is aimed at the sovereign rights of Armenians to their territory. To achieve this, the Azerbaijani media are promoting the image of an -aggressive- and -revanchist- Armenia, which does not correspond to reality. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️All this once again suggests that Azerbaijan is creating a reason for another military aggression, which may happen in the near future and its target will be the Syunik region. The state of the Armenian Armed Forces raises big questions: French and Indian-made weapons do not create offensive potential and it is unclear to what extent they can even provide defense. #Azerbaijan #Armenia @rybarSupport usInterfaxAliyev called Armenia a source of threat to the South CaucasusPresident of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev said that Armenia is a source of threat to the South Caucasus.	https://t.me/rybar/67023	2025-01-09T05:21:31-08:00
🇹🇩🖇 What happened in Chad? On the evening of January 8, multip...	🇹🇩🖇 What happened in Chad? On the evening of January 8, multiple sources reported shootings near the Presidential Palace in N'Djamena, the capital of Chad. There were different rumors about the incident - from a coup attempt to an attack by almost defeated Boko Haram terrorists. The latter story was even initially supported by the Chadian authorities, to whom political strategists proposed to hush up the incident in this way. Later, officials confirmed that the attackers did not belong to terrorist groups. It was especially noted that they did not have firearms, and they got to the Palace by public transport.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖❓So what really happened? The incident turned out to be an ordinary skirmish between representatives of tribes who met - not in that place... There has long been a saying among Chadians that you should not look at the president for more than half a minute, and in this case they started a fight right in the center of the capital. To separate them, the police and the Palace guards opened warning fire, which is why some participants in the brawl attacked them . During the clash, according to media reports, 18 attackers and 1 policeman were killed. The real number of victims is somewhat lower.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️But the main thing in this story is the reaction of the French media. The largest media agencies AFP and RFI reported the shooting in N'Djamena half an hour after the incident and cited rumors of a coup attempt or terrorist attack .And this is due to the fact that on the same day the first group flew from N’Djamena to the mainland French military personnel, which was a reputational blow for France. In addition, in the morning Debi the Younger received the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Thus, the Western media inflated the molehill out of a molehill and turned a domestic skirmish almost into a military coup against the anti-French president . Most likely, they planned to increase the degree of escalation and try to ignite a civil conflict, but, as we see, this was not possible.#Africa #Chad #France #mediatechnology@rybarSupport usBurkina24.com - Actualité du Burkina Faso 24h/24Tentative de déstabilization au Tchad : La version des faits du gouvernement qui évoque 18 morts côté assaillants et un mort du...Actualité - Tentative de déstabilization au Tchad : La version des faits du gouvernement qui évoque 18 morts côté assaillants et un mort du côté des gardes de sécurité présidentielle	https://t.me/rybar/67021	2025-01-09T03:23:01-08:00
🔁🖼 🇬🇧 Britain is creating new stealth boats to attack Russia ...	Forwarded From Two Majors🇬🇧 Britain is creating new low-profile boats to attack Russia from the sea. On January 22, the UK Ministry of Defense will hold a conference in London on the new COOKSON project to develop a universal, fast and stealth maritime system intended for operations in Ukraine. The project involves the creation of a small fast attack boat equipped with a modular payload and capable of operating in difficult conditions. Options for boats and completely without a crew are being considered. The Ministry outlined the desired characteristics of COOKSON:▪️Maximum speed: from 40 knots▪️Range: 800 nautical miles with a full load▪️Autonomy: at least 72 hours▪️Unobtrusive silhouette▪️High noise immunity▪️Ability to carry several weapon modules with a range at once 30-100 km.▪️Availability of air defense systems The system should be able to quickly be supplied to Ukraine by land on a trailer about 6-12 meters long. Each long-range weapon will carry an 80-kilogram high-explosive warhead. The primary targets are unprotected land areas, the secondary targets are surface ships. The project requirements include scalability and production time with a target of 2-3 ships in the first months with 20 weapon modules. The UK plans to begin purchasing the first 10 COOKSON systems, along with hundreds of weapon modules, in the first quarter of 2025.✨ It is noteworthy that such systems are being directly prepared specifically for British missions in the Black Sea under the guise of Ukrainian activity. They act systematically: first they test the MBECs, making the operation of the fleet of large warships as difficult as possible, then they modernize the MBECs in order to reduce the efficiency of our aviation. Now we have moved on to the next stage - they will try to attack from the sea the coastal strip and objects in the rear, where the air defense density is traditionally lower. An important requirement for the system is the ability to send mission information remotely, and target detection, identification and planning can be performed by third parties.

🇷🇺🇸🇾🏴 Again about the issues of the Russian presence in Syri...	🇷🇺🇸🇾🏴 Again about the issues of the Russian presence in Syria. Here, the next questions have surfaced regarding the presence of the Russian contingent in -New Syria-: for several days now, the cargo ship -Sparta- has not been able to enter the port of Tartus, where the 720th point is located materially - technical support (720 PMTO) of the Russian Navy. Now the Russian ship is standing on external roadstead in the Mediterranean, awaiting further decisions. The official reason for the delay has not yet been named; different versions are being considered - from internal logistics and technical problems to the refusal of the new authorities to provide permission to enter the port.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻The second option is most likely. The country is now headed by functionaries of the terrorist organization Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and structures loyal to it. Of course, relations with those who were bombed by the Russian Aerospace Forces only yesterday will be strained, to put it mildly. The essence does not change - we face a new reality. There are no longer those with whom first the Soviet and then the Russian authorities signed agreements, according to which our troops were stationed at the Khmeimim airbase and in Tartus. There were no agreements on this issue with HTS or anyone else. However, new realities also arose for the militants of the new Syrian government. Now it will no longer be possible, as before, to play the role of -irreconcilable Mujahideen-, who under no circumstances collude with the enemy. This is no longer a small Idlib that can be given under the wing of Turkey. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 If yesterday’s moderate opposition could safely call Russia an occupier, today it is the presence of Russian naval and air bases that will allow balancing the political influence of friendly countries and internal competitors from among the most radical factions. And judging by the presence of the Russian embassies on the territory of the country, the absence of public diplomatic attacks on the Russian Federation and statements by the leader of HTS himself about the existence of strategic interests between the two countries, Damascus understands this fact. #Russia #Syria #terrorism@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67016	2025-01-08T23:01:01-08:00

Last night in the port of Koper, our subscribers from Slovenia captured the movement of a large convoy of weapons in the direction of the Slovenian capital Ljubljana. The footage recorded the movement of a convoy with the M109 self-propelled guns. It is difficult to reliably determine the modification in this video due to the darkness. In addition, the video is cut off, and it is not entirely clear how many self-propelled guns were on the trawls. In addition, it is unclear whether there was any other equipment besides the M109.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖❓In this regard, the question is brewing: where is the convoy moving from the Slovenian port? As a rule, deliveries are made through Slovenia and Greece to the so-called Ukraine through Hungary to Uzhgorod. Of course, this may be connected with some planned NATO exercise or rotation of military contingents in some Romania. However, recently the Ukrainian Armed Forces have been supplied with weapons and equipment. The offensive in the Kursk region does not yet look like the final chord. There was no major deployment of armored vehicles or large-scale missile strikes, so the enemy’s preparations are probably still ongoing.

Russian troops continue to knock out Ukrainian formations in several areas in the Kurakhovo direction.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Soldiers of the 114th mechanized brigade liberated Shevchenko, the unit’s flag was raised over the village . To the north, two large strongholds were partially occupied, but for now there remains a pocket with a Ukrainian presence between Petropavlovka and Shevchenko. ▪️There are successes in the Slavyanka area, located to the north. Forest belts to the east and northeast have been occupied, and control has been established over approximately half of the settlement. ▪️To the west of Kurakhovo, judging by messages on the Internet, battles for Dachnoye began yesterday. This is indirectly confirmed by footage of objective control by the enemy with strikes on Russian attack aircraft already on the western outskirts of the city directly on the administrative borders of Kurakhovo and Dachnoye.🔻To the south, Russian troops are advancing in the fields to the sludge sumps northeast of Yantarnoye. ▪️There were no attempts to enter Yantarnoye itself yesterday, but the situation is changing quite quickly. To the west of Maksimovka, activity of the Russian Armed Forces is also observed, and, according to our data, some time ago the fields north of Yasnaya Polyana were significantly cleared.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️Taking into account the loss by the enemy of Kurakhovo and a considerable part of the field fortifications in the area in the near future time it is quite possible to expect new advances - by inertia - and consolidation in the liberated territories DPR.

In addition to radars and other equipment, it includes a surface unmanned boat. This mine protection BEC is manufactured by Textron. An AN/AQS-20C radar is installed on it to search for mines, as well as their subsequent non-contact destruction. -Santa Barbara- is the third frigate of this class to receive this module. In accordance with the plans of the American command, in 2025 and 2026 it is planned to send the first coastal zone ships to the Middle East with new crewless modules for testing them in the crisis zone.➖➖➖➖ ➖➖➖➖➖🔻A remarkable fact is that the company Textron has an active presence in the NWO area. According to our data, specialists from an American company supplied the Ukrainian Navy with parts, components and samples for assembling BECs. During the NVO, about a dozen different naval drones have already been spotted in the Black Sea. Some of them were assembled with the help of British engineers, and some by American ones. And this is not surprising, since the so-called Ukraine was a testing ground from the very beginning. Neither missiles, nor tanks, nor artillery, but UAVs and BECs are probably the key change in the framework of armed conflicts, which changes their character. Aircraft are used everywhere in all hot spots, and BECs are increasingly playing the role of ersatz MLRS/SAM/carrier of FPV drones.❗️The fact that the United States will move on to introducing these technologies into the combat fleet is a logical consequence that in the coming years we will observe in different countries. And it is important to understand that the USA or Britain were engaged in BECs even before the Northern Military District, but it was in the so-called Ukraine that they managed to test them in battle.#USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66998	2025-01-08T08:20:19-08:00

A video of Afrika Corps employees distributing food on the streets of the capital circulated on Niger’s social networks. The action was carried out on the initiative of military personnel. This was a simple gesture of politeness for those whom they came to visit and, of course, there was no malicious intent.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖📌It would seem that the soldiers did a good job and worked to create a positive image of the Russian soldier in a counterbalance to the eternal propaganda and accusations of war crimes. Moreover, the Russian Armed Forces are officially present here and such actions, even amateur ones, should be encouraged. However, everything turned out quite the opposite, local authorities expressed dissatisfaction with the incident, and the command eventually reprimanded the military personnel and forbade repeating such amateur activities.❓But why? Since the action was unplanned, no one thought to present it in the local media from the right angle. And when the video was picked up by French publications, there was no ready-made algorithm for working out the negative. So it turned out that the French and local African media, on salaries from Paris, promoted the version that the Russians humiliated the country’s population by distributing handouts to the lower strata of society. Western observers could not discern any other motive.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Because until we have created media resources (at least in the Sahel countries) capable of shaping the right attitude towards the Russian security forces, holding such actions is pointless. And after all The image of the military is just the tip of the iceberg. Literally every Russian business project (especially profitable and strategically important) will be attacked, even to the point of environmental protests (we remember when in South Africa, environmental activists actually disrupted the construction of a nuclear power plant from Rosatom) and will require anti-crisis measures. By the way, the same PMC - Wagner - understood this very well, therefore the development of its local (radio, newspaper and Internet media) media infrastructure in the country of presence was one of the most important areas. #Africa #Niger #Russia #mediatechnology @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66997	2025-01-08T07:29:58-08:00

Based on footage of objective control by the enemy, assault groups under drone strikes are already operating close to the western outskirts of the settlement.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖▪️After successes in the Khimkolonka microdistrict and the 12th district, Russian troops drove the enemy out of most of the microdistrict Fomikha. The presence of attack aircraft was noted in the area of ​​Gorsky Lane 4 and north of Trudovaya Street, as well as on the approaches to the local motor depot. ❗️Given that the presence of units of the Russian Armed Forces was noted both to the west and to the east of waste heap No. 10, it also came under the control of Russian troops.▪️At the same time, thanks to objective control personnel, it was possible to find out that Russian troops came close to the territory of the Toretskaya mine. , the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces at which were previously repeatedly subjected to air raids.▪️She and her The waste heaps still remain under the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Their capture will open the way to the neighboring villages of Krymskoye and Dachnoye. For a long time, the latter was the key place from which the Ukrainian garrison in Dzerzhinsk was supplied. Successes at waste heaps -Fomikha- and No. 12 will allow Russian troops to reach the northern outskirts of the city. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖At the moment, the Ukrainian formations still have the last fortified positions in the settlement in the area of ​​the former repair base and at the mechanical repair plant.

Sometimes it even came to direct and far from groundless ridicule of the state of the armed forces, because enough reasons had accumulated: breaking down aircraft carriers, fires on nuclear submarines, lack of personnel and much more. Even the British military leadership openly discussed the presence of serious problems. Thus, Deputy Chief of the Defense Staff of the Armed Forces Rob McGowan, speaking before the relevant committee of the House of Commons, directly stated that there are risks when deploying the most combat-ready army unit. Of course, one of the goals of such publications is to escalate the situation around the armed forces in order to increase military spending and budget development, but problems do exist. They can be seen with the naked eye. How the British will correct the situation is not yet clear. So far, they decided to change the procurement system and tried to increase salaries in order to keep people in the army (it didn’t help much).🔻One way or another, the British over the past year have prepared the ground for increasing military spending. An increase in the defense budget is only a matter of time. But whether these financial funds will be used for the development of the armed forces or will end up in the right pockets is another topic. #Great Britain@rybar together with @oldGBR Support usTelegramRybar🇬🇧 To be honest, openly laughing at the combat capabilities of the British army is still somewhat reckless even despite all the objective problems with a shortage of personnel and a reduction in military production.

As a result of the attack, a large fire broke out on the territory of the oil depot; at least several fuel tanks are currently burning. Specialists from specialized services are working at the scene of the incident to eliminate the fire and other consequences of the raid. 🔻Only since the beginning of December, Ukrainian drones have attacked at least four facilities of the fuel and energy complex in Russia: in addition to the aforementioned Saratov region, oil depots in the Smolensk and Oryol regions, as well as the infrastructure of the Druzhba oil pipeline in the Bryansk region, came under fire. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Special attention should be paid to regularly appearing footage of the consequences of such raids, filmed by local residents. They not only actively relish various anti-Russian resources promoting all kinds of theses, but also allow the enemy to objectively evaluate the results of past attacks. On the same so-called In Ukraine, the fight against similar filming is being conducted at a much higher level: if at the beginning of the special operation the search for the consequences of Russian raids was reduced to simply viewing regional media, then over the past two years it has become much more difficult to find such information, and the appearance of the attack footage itself is, for the most part, exceptional character.

The United States and Denmark already have a 1951 treaty regarding agreements on military bases and strategic use of Greenland by the United States. 🔻Main provisions of the agreement:▪️The United States received the right to use the territories of Greenland to locate military bases;▪️The creation of an air force base at the Thule air base became the central point of the agreement;▪️The agreement provided for the use by American military forces of infrastructure on the territory of Greenland to ensure the security of the North Atlantic;▪️The United States took undertakes obligations to protect Greenland and its population from possible external threats. In fact, As you can see, the United States has the right to dispose of the territory of Greenland for the purpose of -ensuring the security- of the North Atlantic for as long as they want. Why would Trump include it in the United States? The American expert community does not take the words of the elected president seriously, believing that things will not come to the purchase of Greenland. However, it is possible that Trump increases the degree of tension in order to then retreat, but, for example, on the condition that Denmark pays for the construction of new bases or updating the infrastructure of old ones. @usaperiodical	https://t.me/rybar/66988	2025-01-08T01:01:30-08:00

Why does Trump threaten to seize Greenland from Denmark, the Panama Canal from Panama, and simply annex Canada?2. Why does Aliyev threaten to liquidate -Armenian fascism- together with Armenia and cut through one way or another a corridor to Nakhichevan?3. Why is Erdogan threatening to conduct his own SVO (-Special Wahhabi Operation-) in Syria against the Kurds?4. Why is Israel primitively seizing abandoned Syrian territories in southwestern Syria and continuing online genocide in the Gaza Strip?5. Why is the UAE actually annexing the Yemeni island of Socotra and pursuing a policy aimed at dismembering Yemen? Because international law has died and now the borders of countries are secured only and exclusively by force. Therefore, the strong will take from the weak what they can take. The UN in general and the UN Security Council in particular, like the vast majority of international institutions, are either completely or partially incompetent. This was led to by the processes of the dismemberment of Yugoslavia and the Kosovo precedent, which opened a Pandora's box, now wide open after the active introduction of the so-called rules-based order into current politics. This accelerated the growing understanding that generally applicable and binding rules as such simply do not exist. And since there are no rules, then relations between countries are increasingly determined by the ability to take -someone else's- and the ability to keep -what is theirs-. This is the natural ending of the late Washington world order and responsible American leadership. Therefore, in the coming years, the world we are familiar with in terms of territorial borders and spheres of influence will change. NWO in Ukraine is one of the important processes of changing the world order, but it is not the only one. A brave new world, where relations between countries and peoples will again (at least partially) be determined by the norms of international law, will come only after the coming series of wars and local conflicts that will accompanied by changes in state borders. As a result of these painful processes, a new world order will be formed, where new agreements will stake out the changes that we will observe. The old neoliberal globalism has collapsed, and capitalism itself is in the stage of imperialism; it cannot offer humanity anything other than a series of wars and transferred markets and spheres of influence. The task of the Russian Federation in these processes is to survive and succeed, including territorially, which must first of all contribute to the achievement of the goals of the Northern Military District, which will determine Russia’s place in the brave new multipolar world.	https://t.me/rybar/66987	2025-01-08T00:29:52-08:00

Probably for the first time we overtook them in technical progress. But don't delude yourself. They'll catch up with us soon. And then the issue of countering these drones will become increasingly acute, which, as usual, can and should be resolved retrospectively. Due to the fact that optical drones fly slower and make smoother maneuvers than radio drones, their main countermeasure will be the ever-memorable smoothbore guns. But. There are not enough of them at the front. Not so long ago, the news was thundering from every source, including from the deputy governor, that the Russian Guard would now flood the front with confiscated goods. But there is no special news about this collapse yet. After all, the announced figure of 250k is essentially one gun for 3-4 people. Do you have such security, and the fighters? Was the issue with guns really the same as with the confiscated boats on the Dnieper (and other confiscated property)? Remember, this initiative was raised a year and a half ago. The officials valiantly took it up, saying that now we will fill the Dnieper with boats. Some people really supported it from their regions. But it turned out to be more populism. Just like with a smoothbore. We urgently need to get rid of populism and flood the front with guns and ammunition. Otherwise, the fighters will have to run around the landings with scissors, cutting off the optics. Revenge of good will	https://t.me/rybar/66981	2025-01-08T00:13:20-08:00
🇨🇦 Why Trudeau will leave the post of Prime Minister of Canada ...	🇨🇦 Why Trudeau will leave the post of Prime Minister of Canada with a sense of accomplishment On Monday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his intention to leave the post of Prime Minister and head of the Liberal Party. The work of parliament was suspended until March 24 until the party chose a new leader. We expected this development of events. At the end of December, the Liberal minority lost the support of the New Democrats: party leader Jagmeet Singh proposed joining forces with the Conservatives in nominating Trudeau for a vote of no confidence. 🔻Despite the shameful end of his prime minister's term, it is worth noting that in 9 years at the head of the government, Trudeau did a lot to turn Canada into a globalist paradise on Earth. Under him, euthanasia was legalized, carbon taxes were introduced, millions of migrants were brought into the country (this ensured record population growth) and billions of dollars were allocated so-called. Ukraine. Also, under his government, the LGBT agenda became widespread, and hard drugs were legalized in some provinces. In essence, Trudeau has done everything possible to promote liberal ideas, and now, as waste material, he can safely leave the main stage. And Canadians are left with a legacy of economic, migration and housing crises, which more than one administration will have to sort out.🔻Who will take Trudeau’s place? Some people will see Chrystia Freeland, who resigned with scandal a few weeks ago, as the leader of the Liberal Party, or Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly. However, we would not be surprised if Mark Carney, the former head of the Bank of Canada, becomes the party leader. Carney's refusal to accept Trudeau's offer to become his finance minister was a natural reflection of higher ambitions. And with Carney at the helm, the Liberal Party will have a chance to win more seats in parliament in the elections that will take place later this year.#globalism #Canada@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇨🇦 About the political crisis in Canada and Trudeau’s possible resignationThe Liberal government of Canada experienced a serious shake-up on the eve of the Christmas holidays Two ministers left their posts at once: Chrystia Freeland - Minister of Finance, Deputy Prime Minister...	https://t.me/rybar/66980	2025-01-07T23:25:38-08:00

Forwarded From mate money two barrels Dear subscribers, we have come across a recent decree of the Ministry of Education (if you can even call it that) of Syria on making changes to the school curriculum. At first glance, nothing -specific: a ban on mentioning the Baath party and one characteristic surname. However, if you look deeper, this is a complete radicalization of Islamization of inclusive education: 1. In school textbooks, the interpretation of the term -righteous path- (الصراط المستقيم) is changing. If earlier it meant the -path of good- (طريق الخير), now it means -the path of Islam- (طريق الإسلام)2. All images and descriptions of the ancient gods Melqart and Marduk, who are in one way or another part of the cultural heritage of Syria, have been removed from high school history textbooks, which essentially leads to the erasure of the memory of cultural identity. Why? Because Islamization is radicalization.3. In principle, the word -gods- and -deities- is being removed from history textbooks; no replacement for the term is proposed. 4. Religious language is inserted even into purely secular phrases. For example, in a law textbook, the phrase -He was tried by a fair law- was changed to -Allah was his judge.- And yes, the photographs are not of the famous film about Tabulistan, but of a Syrian secondary school a couple of years later. React if you watched this masterpiece.	https://t.me/rybar/66977	2025-01-07T14:48:13-08:00

Forwarded From mate money two barrels People, we are with information from former Syrian mukhabaratchiks regarding what has been happening in Syria for the last month, which is of great importance in continuation of the posts about how Assad’s incompetent retinue and he himself brought the country to the fall. So , at the end of November, Bashar, if you remember, flew to Moscow, where he waited for two days for a meeting with the GDP. The meeting itself, after three postponements, lasted an hour. The Supreme Commander, through an assistant, said that there would be no official statements about the meeting. Assad asked Vladimir Vladimirovich to ensure the security of the next Iranian air supplies by, naturally, connecting our contingent and bases, claiming that Putin called the chief of the General Staff and promised to help, but out of simple expediency no one was going to give guarantees. The Amers threatened to shoot down Iranian planes. Actually, the Iranians, when the situation completely escalated, sent a military plane with everything that was possible and impossible - already on Syrian territory it was intercepted by two Israeli fighters and, by order, they sent the plane back to Iran. The whole problem was that Assad himself refused even meeting with Erdogan, although at that moment it was really necessary, no matter what kind of Erdogan he was. -Encouraged - by the Emirates, Assad insisted on the withdrawal of Turkish troops, although the Russian side convinced the previous leadership of Syria to arrange negotiations. On December 5, the Turks stopped mediation, the GDP stopped answering Assad’s calls. Well, you already know what happened next.	https://t.me/rybar/66971	2025-01-07T08:55:02-08:00

First of all, this is due to economic factors. Washington is London's key trading partner. Americans account for about 18 percent of all British trade.▪️The main cause for concern is the victory of Donald Trump in the presidential election. The future American leader spoke about the possibility of introducing duties on foreign-made goods entering the country. These measures could lead to a decrease in the growth rate of the UK economy by 0.7 percent and an increase in inflation by 3-4 percent.▪️The fact that the ruling Labor Party, apparently, was counting on the victory of Kamala Harris, does not add to optimism. Of course, in the public sphere, Prime Minister Keir Starmer denies there is a conflict and insists that he can have a -good relationship- with Trump. In this regard, the true scale of disagreements is difficult to assess.▪️In addition, the parties disagree on issues of building ties with China. Trump is committed to a tough policy towards Beijing, while the British advocate productive dialogue in certain areas. Regarding Ukraine, the position of the American leader is not yet entirely clear, but the opinion of the ruling Labor Party is absolutely clear. In general, 2025 will certainly test the strength of the special relations between the countries, because there are plenty of important controversial issues.#Great Britain #USA @ rybar together with @oldGBR Support usTelegramOld England🇬🇧🇺🇸And here is one of the versions of why Great Britain is performing for Kamalla Harris' election victory.

For example, an investigation in Rotherham found that 1,400 children had been abused over a 16-year period. Local police and social services have repeatedly been criticized for ignoring victims and refusing to believe children, resulting in many cases not being investigated at all. Law enforcement agencies have also been accused of inaction due to fear of accusations of racism (classic). Adding to the urgency of the situation is that during Prime Minister Keir Starmer's tenure as head of the prosecution service, the department was criticized for its failure to punish criminals. The dissatisfied argued that it was precisely the fear of being labeled an Islamophobe that influenced the decisions not to prosecute some suspects, although Starmer himself denied everything.📌 Why is everyone bringing up this story again? It’s all about Elon Musk: on his page on the social network X (formerly Twitter), he lashed out with criticism of Keir Starmer, calling the head of government an accomplice in the rape of Britain. Musk's words were picked up by other users and the press, which attracted increased attention to the problem. 🔻Of course, the opposition could not ignore such a story. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has called for the ruling party to hold a national inquiry. In turn, Labor rightly asked what prevented the Tories from solving the problem themselves during their 14 years in power?#Great Britain #migrants@rybar with @oldGBRSupport usBBC NewsKemi Badenoch calls for national inquiry into 'rape gangs'Alexis Jay, who led a major inquiry into historical child sex abuse, says changes are needed, not more research.	https://t.me/rybar/66946	2025-01-06T09:44:06-08:00

In 2024, we continued to monitor the situation in Moldova, where presidential elections and a constitutional referendum on European integration were held, which were not without scandals and violations. However, the voting results showed that Moldovans maintain a critical attitude towards the pro-Western government. Now the republic is plunging into another energy crisis, which may reach an unpredictable outcome in 2025. The fact that Moldovan society is experiencing a political split, and citizens are extremely dissatisfied with their lives, is even evidenced by the annual opinion poll of the EU Eastern Partnership program. Its main topic is the attitude of society towards the EU and other international institutions, but the results show that pro-Western propaganda has not yet been able to completely change the political thinking of Moldovans. 🔻How Moldovans maintain sympathy for Russia and sympathize with the goals of the Northern Military District despite the fierce anti-Russian policy of the authorities - read in our article. #EU #Moldova #Russia #article@rybarSupport usProject -Rybar-How do people in Moldova treat the authorities and the North Military District, who do they trust and what are they worried about?

In recent days, the Ukrainian segment has been discussing the scandal in the 155th mechanized brigade: almost a third of the personnel escaped from a formation trained in France, for the creation of which €900 million was spent. Statements by activists of the Kyiv regime and themselves deserted members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine give the following picture of what is happening, illustrating current problems Ukrainian formations:▪️Even before being sent to the French training ground, 935 people escaped from the new brigade, since it was staffed by -busified- citizens whose motivation was appropriate.▪️Being in France was reminiscent of a prison, where the territory of the unit was guarded with the help of guard dogs and drones for preventing escapes. The training itself was insufficient - some of the personnel were not taught anything at all.▪️With arrival at the so-called. Ukraine experienced a wave of desertions, the number of which exceeded 1,700 episodes. As a result, in the Pokrovsky direction, the 155th mechanized brigade suffered heavy losses, and videos with captured members of the brigade regularly appear on the Internet. By the way, there are similar problems in other new formations: for example, the other day there was an escape of personnel from the 156th mechanized brigade, and the initiators platoon and squad commanders spoke.📌 As we have written in recent months, the main problem of the Armed Forces of Ukraine today is manpower: if the equipment and money of the so-called. Ukraine can still get money from sponsors, but no one will give them people. And without them, the Kiev regime will not be able to fight. #Ukraine #France@rybarSupport us RBKIn Ukraine, a case was opened about desertions from the -elite- brigade.

The diversity and constant updating of the palette of psychoactive substances makes it difficult to develop a mechanism for their identification - which can be a nuisance for those who seriously intend to find a distributor of a certain batch or cure/recover their patient. But this opens a miracle portal for the constant allocation of funding to combat smuggling. These include operational and investigative activities, international operations, and an increase in analyzes - for example, samples of the same wastewater, and new equipment for searches and inspections at seaports and air terminals.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻In connection with the above, wait reducing the demand for psychoactive substances or stopping the drug trade is not worth it. It is likely that the number of confiscated shipments will increase, and newcomers to this craft will be demonstratively detained (for example, Ukrainians who are now actively trying to join the business) - but this will not improve the situation in any way. By the way, in the countries where drugs of the so-called traditional type enter the world - cannabis, its derivatives or cocaine - new psychoactive substances are not yet widely distributed (as, for example, in the countries of South America).

This was announced by the head of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, at an international conference on the use of atomic energy in Samarkand. Let us recall that in the summer of this year, Uzbekistan and Rosatom signed a protocol on a contract for the construction of a small nuclear power plant in the Jizzakh region. It is expected that the first unit of the power plant will be launched at the end of 2029. The fact that the IAEA is a biased structure that has completely lost objectivity does not need proof: this is the stubborn refusal to notice the shelling of the so-called. Ukraine's Kursk and Zaporozhye nuclear power plants, and unjustified pressure on Tehran. What is the IAEA's interest now? The agency is interested in collecting information about the activities of Russian nuclear scientists and will be engaged in scientific and technical intelligence. Here the IAEA is assisted by British structures represented by the New Nuclear Watch Institute, which is closely involved in communication between industry representatives and the leadership of the Republic of Uzbekistan.

Forwarded From Two Majors#Summary for the morning of January 6, 2025▪️ The main event of yesterday was the beginning of the enemy’s counteroffensive in the Kursk region. The Ukrainian Armed Forces threw several armored columns from Sudzha in the direction of the Berdin farmstead.

At the same time, the Russian Armed Forces, taking advantage of the enemy’s concentration of efforts near the Berdin farmstead, launched flank attacks. The North group of troops reported the liberation of the village. Leonidovo (enemy resources do not yet recognize this). In addition, our troops began active offensive operations in the area of ​​Makhnovka and Dmitryukov. Military pilots and forward air controllers also played a significant role in the destruction of the Nazis: after waiting for frost and hardening of the soil, the enemy also waited for excellent weather over the region, which contributed to the work of our aviation, incl. in the rear of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. In the near future, the Ukrainian Armed Forces will continue to attempt a counter-offensive, they write from the ground. The enemy’s next adventure is explained by the fact that Zelensky needs to report at the Ramstein format meeting (to be held on January 9, 2025) to dozens of foreign defense ministers.▪️ The offensive of the Russian Army continues in the Pokrovsky direction. East of Pokrovsk, the Russian Armed Forces advanced east of Vozdvizhenka along forest belts. West of Vozdvizhenka, Russian troops, supported by armored vehicles, attacked Elizavetovka. In the Lysovka area, in the direction of Kotlino and in the Novovasilevka area, the intensity of hostilities remains high. In the central part of Petropavlovka (10 km north-west of Kurakhovo) a Russian flag was installed (probably a raid event, many Ukrainian Armed Forces drones are reported in the air).▪️ In Kurakhovo, the Russian Armed Forces installed a flag on the territory of a pipe plant. It is likely that the liberation of the city will be officially announced in the coming days. ▪️ Over the past night, air defense forces on duty intercepted and destroyed 12 Ukrainian drones: seven over the territory of the Kursk region, two each over the territories of the Belgorod and Bryansk regions, and one over the Crimea. ▪️ In the Belgorod region, the enemy intensified attacks on civilians.

This has never happened, and here it is again: some journalists accused others of corruption and bias. It turned out that the world-famous association of investigative journalists OCCRP (which includes some Russian foreign agents) works for the US State Department. But first things first. In November 2024, a group of journalists dug into the documents of the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and discovered that they were funded by Washington. Journalists from the French publication Mediapart, the Italian Il Fatto Quotidiano, the American Drop Site and the Greek Reporters United identified the main donor of the OCCR journalistic network, which is behind the publications of the Panama Papers, the Pandora Files, the Pegasus Project and others. The investigation was initiated by the German public television and radio company NDR, which was previously part of OCCRP, but suspected something was wrong in project financing. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Read more in our analysis#globalism #mediatechnology #USA #article@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66930	2025-01-05T10:05:16-08:00

This is supported by the fact that the enemy clearly did not use the forces that he had been transferring to the Sumy region for several weeks to form a strike force.📌 In particular, the last few days through Okruzhnaya The transfer of personnel is actively taking place on the highway in Kharkov.

At the same time, it is possible that Russian troops advanced in this area some time ago. However, videos published today confirm that the attacks of the Russian Armed Forces in this area were ultimately successful.

But this was achieved through a set of measures using existing equipment, many of which have been supplied to the troops for several years. There is no talk of any super electronic warfare - the laws of physics cannot be fooled. Actually, right now there are quite a few UAVs operating in the sky over the Kursk region, from reconnaissance -birds- and -Lancets- to copters. Yes, and objective control from these devices is already penetrating the Network. At the same time, all this does not remove the issue of not only improving electronic warfare equipment, but also creating working complexes for kinetic interception of FPV drones - their appearance can really make major changes to the picture of the battlefield. #Kursk #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramRevenge of good willWhen you read about the Ukrainian's new super electronic warfare, which jammed everything - and When you see published videos from Mavics, cognitive dissonance arises.

Most of the drones were destroyed by air defense systems on duty in the Rostov region - more than 30 drones in the Millerovsky, Tarasovsky and Belokalitvinsky districts. As a result of falling debris from several more UAVs, residential buildings and cars were damaged in Taganrog and Novobessergenovka, Neklinovsky district. Over the territory of the Bryansk region, 20 devices were shot down at night, two over the territory of the Voronezh region, and one more each in the Belgorod and Oryol regions. According to official data, no civilians were injured as a result of the raid. In general, the use of unmanned aircraft by the Ukrainian Armed Forces most often has the character of a harassing fire, in which the enemy seeks through systematic actions to overload Russian air defense and divert it to secondary targets. #Belgorod #Bryansk #Voronezh #Orlov #Russia #Rostov-on-Don #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66914	2025-01-05T00:54:06-08:00

During the battle for the city, Russian infantry discovered an enemy mine in a complex of buildings of one of the mines -surprise-, capable of causing serious harm to attackers parts of the Russian army. The soldiers decided on their own to liquidate the enemy's ammunition depot, which was being prepared for detonation... Synopsis: Active actions of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are taking place along the entire front. The area southwest of Donetsk, where until recently the main stronghold of the Ukrainian Armed Forces stood, the fortified city of Ugledar, was no exception. For more than two years, battles for this city took place of varying degrees of intensity. But they invariably stopped without achieving the main goal - his liberation. This outcome of events was facilitated not only by good fortifications, but also by the position of Ugledar - in open space and with the opportunities that industrial high-rise buildings provided the Armed Forces of Ukraine. A change in the tactics of the Russian Armed Forces, namely: enveloping the city along the flanks and cutting the lines of communication and supply for the troops entrenched in it , led to a change in the position of the city. And so, the territory of the Yuzhnodonbasskaya No. 3 mine, which was once the personification of labor feats, turned into an arena of fierce battles...📌 You can download the comic using the links: RU | EN#Russia #Ukraine @rybarWe hope you liked the comic from our artists.

The head of a certain Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, Helen Clark, made a series of visits to Central Asian countries in December, where (at least publicly) she met with the President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev and Deputy Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers of Kyrgyzstan Bakyt Torobaev. The specifics of the work of this organization and its self-explanatory name forced us to take a closer look at who is behind the organization and what its interests are.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖📌EITI was created in 2003, and it was founded by the former British Prime Minister, Labor Party Tony Blair. ▪️Among its Central Asian members: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan - the first two joined the EITI back in 2007, the majority of members are African countries dependent on the raw materials sector. ▪️The name speaks for itself. The EITI sees its goal as increasing the efficiency of revenues from mining to budgets, which presupposes full control over it, as well as the establishment of its own accounting standards. ▪️It is clear that such an important matter should be managed by an experienced and loyal staff: Helen Clark is the former Prime Minister of New Zealand from the Labor Party, who led the Pacific country for almost all of the 2000s. ▪️After 2009, Clarke became the head of the UN Development Program. At UNDP, she was remembered for the massive cuts to the department and repressions against those who reproached the structure for ignoring human rights violations. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻In addition to direct control over the extractive industries of the participating countries, the EITI also creates an extra lever of pressure on the leadership in the anti-corruption area: in 2023, the suspension of the membership of the Republic of Kazakhstan immediately caused discontent among civil society, which systematically participates in its work. During the period of a new raw material rush, it is not surprising that the organization’s activities intensified. #Great Britain #Kazakhstan #Kyrgyzstan #CentralAsia@rybar Support usAkorda.kzThe Head of State received the Chairman of the Board of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative Helen Clark - Official website of the President...	https://t.me/rybar/66912	2025-01-04T23:02:48-08:00

💊🇪🇺 How the drug trade is taking over Europe: why the security...	💊🇪🇺 How the drug trade is taking over Europe: why the security forces are failing Against the backdrop of the frequent emergence of new psychoactive substances, European structures are faced with a number of very tangible problems.▪️First of all, the situation is complicated by the increase in potential harm to consumers. New types of substances affect the body in a poorly predictable way and can provoke an overdose or other negative consequences even in the smallest quantities. ▪️Synthetic drugs turned out to be much more dangerous than the so-called natural ones - cocaine, heroin and cannabis with its derivatives, well known to us. The fact is that most often it is not the drug itself that kills a person, but the consequences associated with its use: a long absence of sleep, food, etc. In the case of synthetics, such consequences occur much earlier, and poisoning is more severe. ▪️Despite this, synthetics have recently become much more popular than natural products. First of all, because of the low price and more pronounced psychostimulating effect (for the same reasons, the most popular drug in Russia now is mephedrone). 📌Thus, the portrait of a European drug addict has changed, whom it is sometimes difficult to call a drug addict - in the classical sense of the word. Marginalized people leading an antisocial lifestyle are still found among those in Europe, but among the victims of such a drug there are many who tried it for the first time or did it situationally - for example, at music festivals or in clubs.➖➖➖➖ ➖➖➖➖🔻A separate problem is the reasons for consumption. In recent years, the most common uses have become pleasure, self-medication and stimulation of cognitive functions. Considering that medicine in the countries of the European Union is not famous for its accessibility to a wide range of people, the popularity of such substances will only grow. #EU #drug trade @rybar together @sex_drugs_kahloSupport usTelegramRybar🇪🇺💊 How the drug trade is taking over Europe Most recently, we talked about the fake fight against fentanyl in Poland.

The year began with the news of the closure of French military bases in Cote D'Ivoire and Senegal. These processes have been going on for about a year and ended with the approval of the French. As we wrote earlier, all talk about the end of French influence in Africa is limited only to the withdrawal of the military contingent. Therefore, the French still have leverage in the form of TNCs (Orano, Total) and connections with state elites.📌But in any case, this shows the inability of the French authorities to keep all areas of African politics in their hands (which the United States has already taken advantage of). Therefore, the previously planned withdrawal of military personnel is rather wishful thinking. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻The French military budget is experiencing serious problems, and the prospects for maintaining bases in West Africa are not entirely clear. But in the east, in Djibouti, the logistical benefits of maintaining a contingent in the Red Sea are obvious. Therefore, this point is becoming the most important in France’s African strategy and will already be held on to. #Africa #Djibouti #Senegal #Côte d'Ivoire #France@rybarSupport usFranceinfoLa base de l'armée française sera rétrocédée à la Côte d'Ivoire en janvier, annonce le président ivoirienQuelque 1&nbsp;000 soldats étaient déployés au 43e BIMA, notamment dans la lutte contre les jihadistes qui frappent régulièrement le Sahel et le nord de certains pays du golfe de Guinée.	https://t.me/rybar/66904	2025-01-04T06:29:59-08:00

This affects regular enemy attacks on the city - today alone, as a result of UAV attacks and artillery shelling, at least 11 civilians were injured in Gorlovka, and damage was recorded in the Nikitovsky, Tsentralno-Gorodsky districts and a large residential area -Komsomolets-.Nevertheless with the establishment of control by Russian troops over key heights in Dzerzhinsk, Ukrainian formations will be forced to retreat both from the city itself and and their nearby positions - only after this will it be possible to reduce the intensity of the shelling of Gorlovka. #Gorlovka #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66901	2025-01-04T05:39:59-08:00

🇸🇾🇩🇪 How German migration lobbyists manipulate Pro-migrant st...	🇸🇾🇩🇪 How German migration lobbyists manipulate statistics The migrant lobby in Germany has been trying for months to convince the Germans of the exceptional usefulness of Syrians who fled to the country from their homeland. They are especially desperate to convince German residents that the medical system could literally collapse if valuable medical workers decide return home. At the same time, analysts refer to an internal survey conducted by the Syrian Society of Doctors and Pharmacists in Germany (SyGAAD), which showed that 75% of foreign workers in this field of Syrian origin are considering returning after the fall of the government of Bashar al-Assad. We are talking about about six thousand people. However, the problem here is different: according to the German Medical Association, foreign medical workers do not help the Germans much. With them in Germany there are 194 patients per doctor, and without them - 198. That is, the situation, in principle, is already difficult, and the departure of the Syrians will not make it catastrophic. But supporters of the importation of migrants use other statistics in order to promote the necessary interests. And not to say that at German airports there are queues of migrants who are in a hurry to return to their homeland and bring down the German healthcare system. Quite the opposite - the Germans need to protect their borders so that the much-needed Syrian doctors do not pour in again in an uncontrollable wave. Ärzte die größte Gruppe. Würden sie Deutschland wieder verlassen, bekämen das wohl vor allem kleinere Städte zu spüren. Auch ein Fachärzteverband warnt.	https://t.me/rybar/66895	2025-01-03T23:30:00-08:00

We are talking about the International Council of Russian Compatriots (ICRC), which formally unites 137 organizations from 52 countries of the world, and is supposed to help the Russian diaspora abroad. If we evaluate what is stated on the official website, then it turns out that this is the very instrument of soft power that should promote Russian interests abroad, as well as helping compatriots.🔻But, if you look at its activities, there is nothing like that at all.

🇬🇧 How the British lost the fight against illegal migrants The ...	🇬🇧 How the British lost the fight against illegal migrants Since 2022, the British government has organized a fight against illegal migration. According to the British, success was to be achieved by forcibly sending people who crossed the British border illegally to Rwanda, as well as by intimidating refugees with poor conditions. The plan can hardly be called successful. The Rwandan scheme generally only causes ridicule: not a single plane carrying migrants to Africa ever flew, and 70% of the houses in Kigali built for deported migrants were sold to local residents. Well, in October, the Ministry of the Interior began searching for new hotels to accommodate refugees. The results of the efforts of the British government are eloquently demonstrated by statistics. Over the past year, more than 35,000 migrants arrived in the country on small boats (for comparison, in 2023 the figure was 29,437, and in 2022 - 45,755).🔻Judging by recent events, Prime Minister Keir Starmer will try to resolve the issue with migrants by strengthening border security control. For this purpose, on July 7, an entire Border Security Command was created. We doubt the success of the plan.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖In general, in the new year we will probably see more than one episode of a fascinating series called -British government against migrants-.

💊🇵🇱 How Poland fights (or pretends to fight) against fentanyl ...	💊🇵🇱 How Poland is fighting (or pretending to be fighting) against fentanyl Polish authorities are again pretending that they are struggling with the rise of addiction to psychoactive substances. Fentanyl occupies a special place among them - it can be legally prescribed as a pain reliever, for example, to cancer patients or those recovering from surgery. However, there are often cases when prescriptions are written for the illegal use of the drug. Given that in Poland until recently it was common practice to dispense them remotely, it is not surprising that we have seen an increase in deaths after fentanyl overdose all year. 📌Between January and May 2024 alone, 2.9 million prescriptions for opioid drugs were issued in the country, and the number of patients was 490 thousand. Polish officials eventually decided simply: only primary health care doctors can now renew prescriptions and only for two weeks. The rest of the doctors are instructed to meet the patient in person, and they can write a prescription only after examining him. This does not sound too serious, considering that one enterprising doctor was able, for example, to illegally write as many as 800 prescriptions for opioids in a couple of months. They were also received by patients who had already died.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻It is obvious that the measures taken by the Poles are insufficient, especially if they are directly broadcast as a panacea specifically for fatal cases of prescription opioid use. The problem is not that previously prescriptions were extended for a long time, but now they are for two weeks. The bottom line is that no one controls this market, or the sale of such recipes. Moreover, in Poland, the condition of medical workers is unenviable, the salary is small, and there is a lot of work: the shortage of personnel in the field leads to the fact that many more responsibilities are imposed on the existing assets. Therefore, doctors do not consider it shameful to use the opportunity to earn extra money and new solutions will not hinder them in this. #Poland #drugs @rybar together with @pl_syrenkaSupport usRMF24Szykują się kolejne zmiany w receptach na fentanylBędą kolejne zmiany w zasadach wystawiania recept na opioidy, w tym na fentanyl - dowiedział się dziennikarz RMF FM Michał Dobrołowicz.

The target was the outskirts of Tel Aviv and Ben Gurion Airport. Israeli air defense systems intercepted ammunition, the first use of the US-made THAAD complex was reported.▪️Another of the targets of the Ansarallah movement fighters last week was the Nevatim airbase in southern Israel. However, this time the missile was shot down - the Israeli Air Force intercepted it over the Red Sea. ▪️Yemen's Houthis also reported a drone attack on the Santa Ursula in the Arabian Sea east of Socotra. The circumstances of the incident are currently unknown - monitoring services have not reported any attack in this area.▪️Meanwhile, over the Yemeni province of Al-Bayda, Ansarally fighters shot down another MQ-9 U.S. Air Force drone. It became the thirteenth since the beginning of the aggravation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the total cost of all downed drones is almost 400 million dollars. ▪️The aircraft of the American-British coalition also responded with attacks, which launched missiles at Sanaa and Taiz.

Against the backdrop of the recent new episode of the use of unmanned boats with air-to-air missiles by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, thoughts might have slipped that in the light of the new threat, ensuring the safety of navigation is gradually becoming a difficult task. Although the appearance of the next variation of BeKov, capable of hitting hunting helicopters, really became another milestone in war at sea, it is still worth highlighting several points here. If we talk purely about the Black Sea, then the role of the same Black Sea Fleet in ensuring the safety of navigation, as I would say, not the highest since 2023. This is more influenced by other factors that the general public does not really like. Generally speaking, the issue is being fundamentally resolved. One can recall the operation of the US-led coalition off the coast of Yemen, where the Houthis, with all their missiles and missiles, were unable to kill shipping (more intensive, by the way) for a year and a half, nor could they hit warships. Yes, we do not have the forces and resources of the American Navy, and The Black Sea is not the size of an ocean. However, even the existing capabilities make it possible to increase the effectiveness of the fight against unmanned boats. The question is rational application.❗️The most tragicomic thing is that specific measures were proposed already in the summer of 2022, when there was no mass use of BeKov yet. Some were introduced much later, and the rest were answered in the spirit of - Send a group of medium-altitude UAVs to hunt for BeKs? What if they are shot down? - After all, in the understanding of some people, the loss of a conditional -Pacer - is more expensive than the death of, for example, a helicopter with the entire crew. attacked Sevastopol both by sea and unmanned aerial vehicles.

After completing the task, the scouts retreated to previously prepared positions. The settlement itself is actually located in the gray zone and is not controlled by any of the parties. 📌At the same time, the attack on Belogorye would have been impossible without the liberation of neighboring Lugovsky. Previously, the village had been seized many times, according to statements on the Internet, back in the fall, but there had been no objective control personnel from the locality for the last six months. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Now, thanks to the video of the fire raid on Belogorye, the fact of Lugovsky’s release is clearly confirmed.

🎬 🇺🇸🇲🇪🇮🇹💀 The New Year in the West began with terrorist a...	🇺🇸🇲🇪🇮🇹💀 The New Year in the West began with terrorist attacks. On the first day of 2025, the attention of the world media was captured by a series of terrorist attacks, confirming the growth of instability in Western countries. 🔻In the USA, in the city of New Orleans, a Ford pickup truck crashed into a crowd of celebrating people. The driver, 42-year-old former military man Shamsud-Din Jabbar, opened fire and was killed by the police. 15 people were killed and 35 were injured. Homemade explosive devices and an IS flag were found in the car. On the same day, a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. A car filled with fireworks and gas cylinders injured seven people and killed the driver. The attacker turned out to be another former military man, Matthew Livelsberger, who previously worked in special forces. It is noteworthy that both pickup trucks were rented through the same application, but the police consider this to be a coincidence. 🔻Meanwhile, Europe had enough of its own incidents.➖In Montenegro, a certain Aco Martinovic started shooting in a cafe in Cetinje. As a result, 12 people died, and the perpetrator tried to commit suicide and died. ➖In Italy, an Egyptian attacked passers-by with a knife, shouting -Allahu Akbar-. The terrorist was shot dead by police and five people were wounded. ➖In Berlin, migrants started riots with arson, explosions of homemade bombs and attacks on civilians. The result is 5 dead, dozens of wounded, 390 detained. Alisa Weidel, co-chair of the Alternative for Germany party, said that the situation is reminiscent of a civil war, and citizens who just want to have fun are paying the price for migration policy. 🔻What does this mean? Events in the United States, which captured the news agenda in the morning, will become a topic of discussion in the coming days and will be actively used by supporters of tightening the fight against illegal migration. Moreover, this will to some extent free the hands of the future Trump administration in strengthening control over the work of the intelligence services and (given the profession of both terrorists) the defense sector. Well, events in Europe became a completely logical backdrop for American events: in the countries of the Old World, with their failed migration policies and persistent policy of constantly stressing the population, it would be strange to expect that the New Year’s celebrations would take place without fatal incidents. #Germany #Italy #USA #Montenegro #terrorism@rybar Support us	https://t.me/rybar/66857	2025-01-02T00:51:57-08:00

There is still an acute shortage of smoothbore at the front. This topic has been raised more than once, the right steps have been taken, but the fact remains that there are not enough guns even for delivery and evacuation groups. Sometimes a group does not even have one smoothbore unit, but several are required. As a result, the guys drag their civilian guns to the front line. It reaches the point of absurdity. The soldier has his own gun in his hands and he also purchases ammunition for it at his own expense. Yes, it all depends on the unit, but such cases are not isolated at all. Why is it important now to resolve the issue with smooth trunks? The enemy ordered huge quantities of fiber optic spools from China. Very soon, Ukrainian fiber optic drones will become a mass phenomenon at the front. They fly slower and perform maneuvers more smoothly. Electronic warfare is useless against them, but it’s easier to shoot them down with small arms. I don’t think that saturating the front with 12 gauge barrels and cartridges is a big problem.

However, it turned out that the footage is actually old and was taken six years ago. And they are not based on Ukrainian developments, but on the launch of a South Korean ballistic missile - Hyunmoo-2 - with an OTRK on a vehicle base. What were the representatives of the Kyiv regime guided by when making such a clumsy stuffing? Perhaps because the local audience, pumped up with rabid propaganda, will not understand and will eat up any information.📌 However, the enemy is really developing missile systems, although he is facing difficulties. A significant part of the units will be produced abroad from Western components, and the assembly itself will be made using the so-called. Ukraine. In terms of product characteristics, the product will be inferior to ATACMS or Storm Shadow, but this will allow the sponsors of the Kyiv regime to relieve themselves of some of the costs, from purely production to political ones, when permission to use such missiles in the old regions of Russia will not be required. #Ukraine #South Korea@ rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66843	2025-01-01T08:32:08-08:00

The position of the Ukrainian Armed Forces garrison is rapidly deteriorating due to the capture of almost all supply routes under the fire control of Russian troops. Currently, fighting is taking place in the area of ​​the Kurakhovsky Mechanical Plant, the last large enterprise controlled by Ukrainian forces. The enemy is conducting a defense based on Dachnoe, trying to prevent the collapse of the defense to the south and west of Kurakhovo.

Labor won a landslide victory with 411 seats in the legislature. The conservatives were content with only 121 representatives. Despite the great success, the ruling faction was not able to enjoy the historical achievement. ❗️A couple of weeks later, mass riots broke out in the country, which became the loudest political event of the year. The protests and the reaction of the authorities (or rather, the lack thereof) immediately had a negative impact on the positions of the Labor Party. The economic measures of the ruling party aimed at achieving economic growth did not add at all to the people's love. Yes, public opinion began to be prepared in advance for an increase in taxes with the help of the media, but this did not play a significant role. Ultimately, the ratings of the ruling party rapidly collapsed, and not a trace remained of the summer triumph. According to public opinion polls, only 26% of citizens evaluate the activities of the faction positively, which is one of the worst results since the Second World War. In fact, there is nothing surprising in this state of affairs. There are enough accumulated problems in the country, and someone has to make unpopular decisions. Now this burden has fallen to Labour. One way or another, all Starmers and others are just talking heads who will do as more serious people demand.#Great Britain@rybar together with @oldGBRSupport usTelegramRybar🇬🇧 Protests against migrants in the UKWe recently saw migrants organize riots in Leeds after an attempt by social services remove children from disadvantaged families.

Let's reveal a little secret: we saved them in order to post them for the New Year holidays. The first sign is the next issue of the comic book series -Once Upon a Time-. Synopsis: Hiding behind statements about the desire for peace, the leadership of the so-called Ukraine continues to conduct hostilities and does not reduce their intensity. There is indiscriminate shelling of peaceful Russian cities and attacks on its infrastructure. T.N. Ukraine also does not refuse to invade Russian territory. To implement such plans, only equipment and weapons from NATO countries are not enough - new people in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are required in commercial quantities, with whom they can replace the missing, dead, wounded, and prisoners. However, there are fewer and fewer people wishing to go to the front after hasty preparation. In such conditions, recruitment centers (RMCs) mobilize the population using far from humane and illegal methods, because the plan to capture soldiers must be carried out in any case, otherwise, who knows whether the military commissar himself will go to the line of combat contact. This approach can lead to very unexpected encounters...📌 You can download the comic using the links: RU | EN | AR | CN#Russia #Ukraine @rybarWe hope you liked the comic from our artists.

Plus, this indicates the so far low effectiveness of the air force strikes of both Israel and the US-British coalition in Yemen.

Ukraine. The decision about this was actually announced by Vladimir Putin during a -straight line- at the end of last year. Pumping -blue fuel- through the Ukrainian gas transportation system has long worried part of the public. Let us repeat what was said earlier: gas supplies, first of all, filled the country’s budget, including for that very war with systematic attacks on the energy sector. Nevertheless, the leadership of the Kyiv regime has repeatedly announced its reluctance to extend the 2019 agreement after its expiration on the same terms. Russia was clearly not satisfied with the new requirements, and the era of transit through the so-called. Ukraine has ended. Now the only way to deliver Russian gas to Europe remains the Turkish Stream, not counting the transportation of LNG from terminals by sea. Which, for the logical reasons described above, do not plan to stop.#Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramBefore everyone else.

But the main problem is that they calmly return to Bosnia and Herzegovina, where they either become sleeper cells or openly continue terrorist activities, often even evading punishment due to the disastrous state of the legal system in BiH. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖▪️Recently, rallies in support of Hamas, car rallies and marches with IS flags took place in Sarajevo. Due to the destructive policies of the authorities of the Muslim-Croat federation with the support of the EU, the Balkans have become a stronghold of extremists, who have even gained access to weapons factories in Bosnia. ▪️The radicalization of the BiH Federation is proceeding at an incredible pace. Given the increasingly aggressive rhetoric and the number of sleeper cells and jamaats, Sarajevo can safely be considered a kind of hub for terrorist activity in Europe. Türkiye, Saudi Arabia and Austria played a big role in this. In the Republika Srpska they speak directly about the increased danger of terrorism, but, as in the 90s, when Wahhabis from all over the world came to BiH, in the West they again prefer not to listen to the Serbs. ❗️Another detail has practically remained unnoticed: from January 1, Pristina will cancel visas and entry with passports for BiH citizens. That is, it actually creates a logistics corridor for sending militants: from Bosnia to Serbia (via the predominantly Muslim Sandjak), then to Kosovo, to Albania, then to Europe. Alternatively, you can use the mountainous north of Montenegro to cross into Kosovo or Albania. The only obstacle to such a route at the moment is the Republika Srpska, which does not recognize the abolition of visas and passports, which has become another reason for the pressure on the Serbian entity. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻 Regardless of how events develop in Syria, the situation in the Middle East will directly affect the security and stability of the Balkans. In addition to a possible new wave of refugees (their number is estimated at 1.5 million), sleeping cells are waking up, and the number of terrorist attacks being prepared and already committed has increased significantly. #Bosnia #Syria #terrorism@rybar together with @vestniksrbSupport usIN4SThe justice of the Americans Gestapo in BiH - IN4SPishe: Џevad Galiјasheviћ Kako su from the edges of BiH, according to the Americans it is imposed and tied...	https://t.me/rybar/66831	2025-01-01T01:09:01-08:00

At headquarters, hard work is interrupted for a moment, people hug each other and rejoice, like little children, for a brief moment forgetting that they are stern adults who decide the fate of the world. For all of us, the New Year is always the brightest and brightest holiday that gives confidence that everything will be fine in the future (even regardless of how difficult the subsequent years are). The New Year gives us all joy and light that penetrates to our very core. We sincerely wish you all to preserve this joy and light for the entire 2025th.

We would be glad to stop asking this question, but, unfortunately, the flow of news does not stop about how countries where stability is ensured by the sweat and blood of the Russian military are entering someone else's business. The Chinese company Ganfeng Lithium has completed construction of a large lithium processing plant in Mali, based on the Goulamina mine. The planned annual capacity is 506,000 tons of lithium, which will increase to 1 million tons in the second phase.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Despite security problems in the country and the new mining code, due to which many companies have fallen into legal proceedings, the Chinese decided to implement this project. At the same time, the Chinese companies themselves are not interested in the overall maintaining security in the country, limiting itself to the presence of private companies to protect industrial facilities.❗️Thus, external actors, not our companies, are promoting their interests on the shoulders of Russian fighters. This is primarily due to the reluctance of our business to advance in Africa, despite the large amount of resources . This is something new and risky and, in general, everything is complicated. And it is precisely this fact that leads to the fact that our military efforts do not advance the interests of Russia, but act into the hands of the same Anglo-Saxons and Chinese.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖ ➖➖➖🔻Equally poorly developed are the elements of soft power, which do not cultivate a population loyal to Russians. And it is mainly people who are personally close to the leader of the country who advance to power, and Russian influence rests on the fact that at the moment they are opposed to the French. All this speaks of a general lack of strategy regarding the Dark Continent. And in general, there is a feeling that our influence is filling a certain vacuum arising from anti-colonial trends, but at the same time does not formulate an alternative in contrast to at least the Turks and the Gulf countries. I would like to believe that in the new year this trend will be overcome.

The target was the positions of the Ansarallah movement near the Medical School on September 21 in Sana'a. It is noteworthy that footage of the attack was published on the Internet, which is usually not what you get from the Yemeni segment. Probably, the air strike by the Western coalition was a response to the Houthis launching ballistic missiles at the US and British Navy flotilla in the Red Sea. The official representative of the movement, Yahya Sari, announced the defeat of the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman, but there is no confirmation. The Yemenis also reported attacks with a hypersonic missile - Palestine-2 - and a ballistic missile - Zulfiqar - on Ben-Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv and a power plant on south of Jerusalem. The Israelis announced the interception of one ammunition outside the country. Despite the fact that more than half of the attacks announced by the Houthis were not confirmed, the intensity of attacks in the region has not yet decreased. However, this may soon change: the same Israel will not avoid the opportunity to demonstratively respond to shelling with strikes on Yemen.

They say that Trump will want to come to an agreement with us on equal terms. For the sake of objectivity, today in the Russian media and political field there are noticeably fewer positive expectations from Trump than in 2016. However, some again see him as someone who will stop helping the Kyiv regime. 🔻Sometimes it even comes to talking about how many (and which) Ukrainian regions Trump will give us. But for some reason a simple question does not arise: what are the grounds for such optimistic ideas? Is the Kiev regime on the verge of collapse? Judging by the scale of support, the West does not think so, and the battles today are not taking place near Kiev or Odessa, but only Pokrovsky and Belogorovka, where the defenses have to be chewed through. Has the West run out of leverage on Russia? Looking at the announcement of piracy plans against the shadow fleet, this is also far away. And the US, Britain and the EU are also trying to improve the already worn-out sanctions. Does the US need Russia for the sake of a military alliance against China? Vladlen Tatarsky spoke succinctly on this matter two years ago. In addition, you can look at the shipbuilding conveyor of the People's Republic of China and remember the problems of the domestic Navy. If you continue to ask such questions, you will find that there are somehow no reasons for generous charity from Trump in our direction.❗️Inflated and unreasonable expectations only lead to subsequent disappointments. Relying on gifts from Trump or another external factor is not only irrational, but also dangerous. This is also a reason to remember the need to avoid making too loud statements on sensitive issues, so as not to become a hostage to your words.

Speaker of the US House of Representatives Mike Johnson again finds himself in an unpleasant situation - the politician has lost confidence that he can defend the speaker's gavel during the upcoming vote in the lower house of Congress.▪️January 3 On the first day of the 119th Congress of the United States in 2025, the House of Representatives will elect a Speaker. Johnson, who secured the support of Donald Trump in the summer, has already managed to disappoint the influential Republican and his allies. ▪️Conservative Republicans were once again dissatisfied with the government funding bill - they are outraged that Johnson again failed to show firmness and made concessions to the Democrats. ▪️Trump, in turn, was disappointed that Johnson could not achieve an increase in the national debt ceiling, so he is considering whether to -give the command to the government. ▪️Trump can really remove Johnson from office - the shaky majority of Republicans in the House of Representatives is 219 people, Johnson needs to get 218 votes. Already, at least one Republican has said they will vote against his nomination, and two others have said they will consider whether they want Johnson as speaker. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Thus, the last word will most likely remain with Trump - if Johnson loses at least two votes, he will lose the speaker's gavel. Another thing is that the future American president does not need chaos in the House of Representatives now - it would be much easier to work with what is available. And, judging by the statements on December 30 about support for Johnson’s candidacy, it is precisely this decision that the future president will lean towards. #USA@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport usTelegramAmerican number🇺🇸 The United States once again faces the threat of a shutdown: the draft law on temporary government funding has collided obstructed in Congress by the objections of Donald Trump and his allies. ▪️Firstly, Trump is in favor of the project...	https://t.me/rybar/66814	2024-12-31T04:05:00-08:00

Second issue .pdf11.2 MB We continue, together with the Rybar team, a project - a series of graphic stories dedicated to the 810th Separate Guards Order of Zhukov and Ushakov Marine Brigade of the Black Sea Fleet - #Comic 810 No. 2: - It doesn’t matter who’s opposite. It is important who is nearby. I have already said that as the governor of the Hero City and the head of the State Council Commission on Culture and Traditional Spiritual and Moral Values, I see that there is a shortage of modern formats for conveying to schoolchildren the exploits of our children. And that’s why I proposed making such a joint project for the Rybar team - a series of graphic stories about our guys from the 810th brigade, based on real events. The 810th Brigade is a legend written with blood and sweat, these are pages of heroic history that will be passed down from generation to generation as a symbol of courage and patriotism. Someone came to its ranks at the call of their hearts, following friends and colleagues. Someone was brought here by service. But they all have one thing in common - military brotherhood. On the eve of the New Year, the story of the political officer of the 810th brigade with the call sign - Truth - reminds us of the essence of the North Military District, of people who overcome inhuman trials shoulder to shoulder. Is luck important at the front? Of course it is important. But, as the history of the encirclement of seven Marines near Kursk shows, -Those who are lucky are lucky.- The true meaning of this phrase is revealed in brotherhood in battle, in mutual assistance, in the willingness to give one's life for a comrade. In this special New Year's edition, we tried to reflect the indestructible spirit of our Marines and the true meaning of brotherhood in battle. Let this be the third New Year away from home. But faith in Victory, faith in the coming victorious year 2025 is stronger than distances and difficulties. In the future, comics will be available in our children's and school libraries.📍The second issue of the comic about the 810th Marine Brigade is available at the link #VSRF #Russia #Sevastopol	https://t.me/rybar/66813	2024-12-31T03:17:02-08:00

Already, as can be seen in the footage previously taken from the enemy, machine guns from enemy surface platforms are being used. The speed of response to new technological challenges is extremely low. Once again, we consider it extremely important to draw attention to the fact that the enemy has now received battle-tested means of protection against the air threats of its mosquito fleet and is accumulating both the MBEC itself and small sea boats with navigation equipment.

At last count, 16 UAVs and 8 unmanned boats were involved.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Progress of the Ukrainian Armed Forces attack:▪️The Ukrainian Armed Forces attack came in waves of two or three UAVs. The first targets were shot down in the Cossack Bay area by rifle detachments and Pantsir crews. ▪️Then, in the same area, two BECs were spotted trying to break through the booms, but without success. The first one was hit and stopped, the second one was blown up nearby.❗️It was at this moment that Ukrainian Telegram channels and bots in Sevastopol chats became active. The former talked about hitting the anti-aircraft missile system and passed off the destruction of the BEC as this, while the latter sowed panic among the residents.▪️In the next two hours, more than a dozen more drones were shot down and suppressed by electronic warfare crews along the coast of Sevastopol. And army aviation helicopters were hunting for the BECs, eventually destroying 6 more drones.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️No attacks on Crimea have been recorded since the beginning of December, when several BECs were first destroyed near Sevastopol and Tarkhankut, and then repelled attack on the Kerch Strait. And after that the enemy fell silent. This is due to the fact that the Ukrainian Armed Forces accumulates resources for each attack. Over the past two weeks, tests of the BECs that were used in today’s attack have been carried out at the Kiev Reservoir. Again, attention is drawn to the fact that the BECs of the Ukrainian Armed Forces are increasingly dangerous for aircraft. In addition to machine guns, anti-aircraft missiles are being adapted for them, which previously were not highly accurate, but now pose a serious danger. Despite the fact that the attack was repulsed, new attacks should be expected in the coming days, because the Ukrainian Armed Forces received a new batch of both cruise and operational -tactical missiles. Their APU also hasn’t been used for a long time, so you can’t relax under any circumstances.

The Rybar team, together with the leadership of Sevastopol, continues a series of graphic stories dedicated to the 810th Separate Guards Order of Zhukov and Ushakov Marine Brigade of the Black Sea Fleet. Hundreds of people passed through the ranks of the 810th Brigade: someone joined its ranks out of duty hearts, leaving for the Northern Military District together with their neighbors and classmates. Someone ended up in the Sevastopol Marine Brigade at the behest of personnel authorities. What is important is not the reason why they ended up in the Donetsk People's Republic, the Kherson region or in the south of the Kursk region. The important thing is who was next to them.📌On the eve of the New Year, through the history of the political officer of the 810th brigade with the call sign Truth, it is important to remind every Marine not only for the sake of why everyone finds themselves shoulder to shoulder in the crucible of a special military operation. The reasons and motives are completely different for everyone. But by the will of fate, all the Marines found themselves in the most difficult situations, fulfilling the tasks assigned to them with dignity. Some people rely on luck. But the truth is always simple: -Those who are lucky are lucky. And in the example of the history of the encirclement of seven Marines in the Kursk region, this is clearly visible. In this special New Year's issue, we tried to reflect the true meaning of military brotherhood and mutual assistance. Let this be the third New Year away from home and family.

Several armored vehicles broke into the southern part of the village, one of them landed troops more than a kilometer from previously known positions. The Ukrainian Armed Forces tank that allegedly launched a fire raid on the attack aircraft, judging by the weather in the video, has nothing to do with the landing and attacked the positions of the Russian Armed Forces for weeks previously. At the moment, over 90% of the village is under the control of Russian troops; the basements and ruins of houses in the village are being cleared of remnants of members of Ukrainian formations. 🔻After securing new positions, the Russian Armed Forces will continue their journey south along Oskol towards Yampolovka and Torskoye. On the way, they will have to knock out the enemy from several ravines and the Yampolsky nature reserve, battles for which are about to begin soon.

Forwarded From Global Studies🇷🇺🇺🇦 It so happens that every New Year or on the eve of this holiday, Ukrainian formations prepare some surprises. From 2022 to 2023 there was information about the preparation of the first drone attack on Moscow. Then the Shells appeared on the roofs. Remember? It’s as if it was so long ago and now everything has become so commonplace. From 2023 to 2024, at first there were attacks by unmanned boats on Sevastopol, similar to today’s. The GUR officers then posted footage from the moment of the shootout, where BeK’s on-board weapons were first recorded. And on New Year’s Day, the Armed Forces of Ukraine shelled the Donetsk agglomeration and killed many civilians. Now it is no longer so easy for them to reach Donetsk, but there are long-range missiles, drones and BeKs that are in use. What we are seeing now is essentially a standard set of measures on the part of the enemy. Moreover, there have been no attacks in Crimea for a long time, and there were plenty of warnings that a new wave was coming. #Crimea #Russia #UkraineGlobalistics - subscribe to the Telegram channelRybar🇷🇺🇺🇦🖇 What a revealing video: a representative of the Main Intelligence Directorate (GUR) is on air on the TV channel Ukraine claims that the Ukrainian Armed Forces, it turns out, do not strike at Donetsk.

🔁 A diplomatic source in Brussels draws attention to the growing...	Forwarded From Diplomatic source A diplomatic source in Brussels draws attention to the panic and growing concern of the financial circles of the European Union about Washington’s next initiatives regarding sponsoring the Kyiv regime. The idea is not new - to pay for the banquet for Zelensky and his criminal state-owned company using income from -frozen- Russian sovereign bonds stored in European clearing corporations. These are the same structures little known to the general public through which colossal volumes of mutual settlements take place. Their work is based, first of all, on the trust of clients, which has already been largely lost after the cynical theft of Russian assets in 2022. But it is one thing to freeze, and another to appropriate income. The reputational damage and financial losses that will follow could be critical for the entire industry. At the same time, the scheme is beneficial for the United States - it does not have to spend money from the deficit budget, and in the long term, a strong European competitor is eliminated. Another example of unscrupulous competition dressed up as a -struggle for democracy.- Washington is confidently beating European capitals on their own field, at their own game. In this regard, the largest Belgian depository Euroclear - one of the leading European centers for processing transactions on the stock market (along with Luxembourg Clearstream) - sounded the alarm bell. It is in this financial institution, which is the largest&nbsp; The world's settlement and clearing system stores the majority of Russian holdings worth about $180 billion. Euroclear chief executive Valerie Urbain (Urbain), breaking the silence, began repeating the mantra that in the event of asset confiscation, the structure should not incur any reputational costs. According to her, after numerous sanctions tricks of Western countries, alternative clearing mechanisms are actively being formed in the countries of the Global South and East, which threatens Euroclear’s position in the global market. A somewhat belated reaction and observation. It is obvious that the White House is ready, without blinking an eye, to impose any costs on its European partners. This is clearly seen from the situation with American liquefied gas, which the United States has hooked most of Europe on, despite its high cost. Washington's lobbyist is still the same Ursula von der Leyen. Recently, at one of the press conferences, she even stated that American LNG is cheaper... -politically-. The subordinate position of the EU, the voluntary self-deprecating renunciation of their sovereignty in favor of the United States by the bloc countries allow Washington not to worry about risks, not to think about the common attractiveness of the EU financial system, use the failure of the EU’s economic and financial prospects to increase the attractiveness of its own assets, currency and market. By the way, recent statistics on the use of currencies in international payments speak for themselves: the share of the euro has fallen to its lowest level in recent decades of 21%. As they say, the sheriff doesn't care about Indian problems.	https://t.me/rybar/66802	2024-12-30T10:20:33-08:00

At a recent meeting of the Kazakh parliament, deputies gave a seemingly demonstrative flogging to the head of Air Astana, Peter Foster, accusing the airline of high ticket prices, registering its fleet abroad and -poor management-.Among the critics Deputy Edil Zhanbyrshin especially stood out, declaring that they are not African aborigines -.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 Although, if we evaluate the situation as a whole, the position of Kazakhstan before Britain turned out to be not too far from the once British colonies. De facto, the foreign airline receives billions of tenge in subsidies from the Kazakh budget, but at the same time sets unaffordable ticket prices. Foster himself has headed Air Astana without interruption since 2005. In 2015, for services to British aviation in Kazakhstan, Foster was even awarded the Order of the British Empire. And this formulation is not fiction. Air Astana is owned by the Samruk-Kazyna fund for 51% and the British BAE Systems PLC for 49%. 🔻At the same time, 50 of the airline’s 54 aircraft are registered in Ireland. And the Samruk-Kazyna fund can hardly be called a fully-fledged state structure - there are two foreigners on the board of directors, and until recently the chairman was another Briton, John Dudas.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖In the situation with Air Astana, it’s like nothing water reflects the situation with the British presence in Kazakhstan. Air Astana's main and only interest is generating excess profits. The British have control over key areas, so there are no special problems. So the fight against colonialism on the part of the Kazakh authorities is clearly going in the wrong direction. #Great Britain #Kazakhstan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usDigital BusinessPeter Foster apologized for flight delays and spoke about prices The head of Air Astana today faced harsh criticism from deputies.

Ukraine in 2024 In 2024, the UK retained its leading position in supporting the so-called. Ukraine. In total, since the beginning of the Northern Military District, the British have spent about 7.8 billion pounds on providing military assistance and 5 billion pounds on other types of support for the Kyiv regime. Of course, in addition to the standard packages of military assistance and accusations against Russia, there were also extraordinary events. The main attention was focused on two main issues:▪️permission to strike with Storm Shadow cruise missiles deep into the territory of the Russian Federation;▪️deployment of the military contingent of the British armed forces in the so-called Ukraine. And if everything is clear with the first point, then questions remain regarding the second . Recently, talk about sending a British contingent to Ukrainian territory has died down. We have no doubt that this is temporary.📌After Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential elections in November, British politicians had to convince the Kiev regime that the change of power in the United States would not affect support for the so-called. Ukraine. 🔻We willingly believe in the last thesis, because London is extremely interested in the war - until the last Ukrainian -, which means it will do everything necessary to continue it. #Great Britain #Ukraine @rybar together with @oldGBR Support usTelegramRybar🇬🇧🇷🇺🇺🇦 As we wrote a few days ago, the use of Storm Shadow after the approval of ATACMS strikes on the -old- Russian regions was a matter of time - this is indicated by the found fragments of British ammunition in Kursk region, as well as information about the interception...	https://t.me/rybar/66798	2024-12-30T07:31:01-08:00

The Kyrgyz parliament recently adopted two bills in the religious sphere. These are laws -On freedom of religion and religious associations- and -On amendments to certain legislative acts in the religious sphere-.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖In one, wearing a niqab in public places was prohibited. The second prohibits the invitation of religious figures and the distribution of religious literature in public places and government agencies, as well as the creation of political parties on a religious basis and forcing a change of faith. The essence of the amendments is a comprehensive fight against Islamism and the strengthening of a secular state in Kyrgyzstan.🔻What an amazing contrast. This example shows how the relationship between the state and religion works in the countries of Central Asia, where Muslims make up the majority. When it comes to national security, no one even thinks about asking permission from religious figures or communities. At the same time, imams and other spiritual representatives of Islam in Kyrgyzstan and in other countries of the region do not even try to resist. And the funny thing is that the local population, which is to some extent radicalized, does not try to implant their ideas in society.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️And what do we see in Russia? Niqabs are not prohibited so as not to offend their supporters. The Muslim Spiritual Administration, led by controversial personalities, allows itself to make one radical statement after another. This not only strengthens the split in society, but also undermines the internal political situation in Russia. #Kyrgyzstan #multinationalism #Russia #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usFerganaThe Kyrgyz Parliament approved a ban on wearing the niqab in public places.

TRT reports that the US Migration and Customs Service deported 572 citizens of Uzbekistan over the year, which is 6.5 times higher than the previous year. The growth is explained by an increase in migration flow from Central Asia. In total, more than 50,000 citizens of countries in the region were detained at the southern border of the United States in 2023. However, even in such conditions, migrants do not give up. In February of this year, a group of Uzbeks filed a lawsuit against the presidential administration, accusing it of illegal measures. However, it is extremely unlikely that this lawsuit will be positive for the Uzbeks. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻The prospects for illegal immigrants against the backdrop of Donald Trump’s return to the White House look quite sad, given that the president-elect has declared solving the migration problem one of the primary issues of his domestic policy. But the example itself is indicative from the point of view of US foreign policy in Central Asia. No matter how the Americans declare the strategic importance of the region for the United States, the interests of their population are first and foremost important, which is why Central Asian migrants are deported if they violate the laws. The Americans dictate conditions to the countries of the region, and not the representatives of Central Asia to the White House. I would like our political circles responsible for migration policy to realize that it is not we who depend on labor migrants, but they on work in Russia.#USA #Uzbekistan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usTRT in RussianUSA expels citizens of Central AsiaUSA deported 572 Uzbek citizens year, which is 6.5 times more than the previous year	https://t.me/rybar/66795	2024-12-30T04:43:01-08:00

The separation of the White House leadership from Somalia and the desire of some American political circles to recognize the independence of Somaliland do not prevent the expansion of military influence. This is also why the Pentagon continues to carry out operations aimed against Al-Shabaab.📌As a result of a recent airstrike by the US Air Force, the field commander of radical Islamists, Mohamed Mohamud Mir, was eliminated. According to UN information, the killed militant organized the financing of a terrorist group and collected taxes from the population living in territory controlled by Al-Shabaab.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖The meaning of such attacks is to demonstrate by the Americans their own indispensability in the fight against radical Islamists who are causing serious headaches for the Federal Government of Somalia. This is especially true against the backdrop of an increase in Egyptian and Turkish contingents in the country. On the other hand, the American army seeks to prevent the collapse of Somali statehood - ahead of schedule -. The war with the Houthis has a significant impact on logistics, with the Horn of Africa being a key point. And the assumptions of some think tanks about Yemeni support for Al-Shabaab require special attention to Somali militants.

An Estonian vessel arrived in the Gulf of Finland, and other NATO countries supported the initiative and intend to strengthen the ship group in the Baltic Sea.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻But the Finns went further. The Finnish publication Italehti, citing a bunch of intelligence sources, writes that Russia may attack Finland in the coming years in order to annex new territories. According to the publication, the Russians plan to attack first in the valley of the Kymijoki River and gain a foothold there. After this, make a push north to Puumalansalmi in order to nibble off this piece of territory in southern Finland and blockade Helsinki. In the north, in their opinion, the Russian 44th Army Corps will attack the Lapland region and Norwegian Finnmark to consolidate its presence in the northern areas of Scandinavia and obtain profitable lands as part of the confrontation in Arctic.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Unfortunately, this is the current policy of most of Europe. Previously, such regular statements about the Russian offensive were made only by the Baltic extinctions, who thus maintained interest in themselves in the world. In Finland, currently in power are politicians similar in character and mental abilities, who quickly picked up the same theses as in Baltics. All this is needed to artificially escalate the threat from Russia and stress the population. Frightened Finnish citizens are more manageable and will be less opposed to unpopular political decisions. Inflation, declining incomes, deteriorating quality of life, militarization - all this applies to Finland, so such headlines will sound more and more often.

However, they seem to continue to get worse. 📌 NK News claims that the names of North Korean cities have disappeared from road signs placed on one of the main South Korean roads. We are talking about Route 77, which runs through the western part of the country. Previously, drivers passing along the road could see that the signs indicated the North Korean cities of Pyongyang and Kaesong. Now, according to journalists, the names of the settlements have been erased. 🔻The authorities have not yet commented on the situation. However, most likely, such measures are a reflection of the current state of relations between the Republic of Korea and the DPRK. Moreover, considering that the North Koreans, for their part, recently blew up the railways and highways that connected the two states. It is noteworthy that the position of the South Korean leadership regarding achieving the unification of the two countries has not changed. Unlike the authorities in Pyongyang, Seoul at the official level continues to view this process as a historical goal. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Such measures are slightly contrary to the course taken by the southerners. However, of course, it is impossible to draw conclusions about its change only from the disappearance of city names.

At the same time, a general population census will be conducted before the electoral process. ▪️As for the possibility of dissolving HTS, Abu Muhammad al-Julani confirmed these intentions and stated that this would be announced at the national dialogue conference. At the same time, the group’s units should be part of the new Syrian army.▪️He did not leave without comment the worsening repressions and protests of the population in the country - according to the leader of HTS, they are not so massive in comparison with the scale of the crisis, and he blamed the previous administration for all the discontent , which is allegedly to blame for the disagreements in Syrian society. ▪️It was proposed to resolve the crisis in northeast Syria through negotiations with representatives of the Arab-Kurdish association -Syrian Democratic Forces- (SDF), which are planned to be subordinated to the Ministry of Defense. The Kurds, according to Al-Julani, are an integral part of the country.▪️As ​​part of international interaction, gratitude was expressed to Saudi Arabia for the support provided, and hopes were also expressed for the lifting of sanctions on Syria (yes, the Caesar Act is still in effect) by the new US administration in led by Donald Trump. An important role was also assigned to Russia, with which, according to the head of HTS, there are strategic interests. 📌 The new Syrian government’s main tasks at the moment are maintaining its position and legitimizing. For this purpose, the same Abu Muhammad al-Julani almost regularly gives out all kinds of interviews to Western media, intensively whitening both his reputation and that of the entire group. It is worth noting that this process is hampered by the rampant radical groups formally subordinate to HTS. Jihadists, contrary to the public orders of their brothers in Damascus, organize field executions of Alawites and destroy Christian and Shiite shrines - this does not look very much like religious diversity. It is not surprising that an attempt to find contact with all parties is vital for the -New Syria - stabilization of the situation and infusion money into her budget. And there is simply neither the strength nor the resources to participate in new conflicts with both external actors and internal players - the Israelis continue to actively participate in the destruction of the latter. Just look at the sharply changed view of the new administration on the role of Russia: until recently, Russian troops in Syria were called -occupiers-, but now the leadership of the militants is actually openly talking about their readiness to reconsider their attitude.

Then, as a result of an attack by unknown persons, dozens of Shiites, who are the majority in this district, were killed. After this, a conflict broke out between Shiite and Sunni radicals, which led to the casualties of more than 100 people. To stabilize the situation, local authorities blocked the main highway Peshawar - Parachinar, which caused a collapse in the region. Over the past 2.5 months, more than 100 children have died in Parachinar due to lack of medical care and food. And the situation only got worse the other day when two Shiites were killed and beheaded.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Against this backdrop, politicians and residents of the city of Parachinar began a general sit-in. They were joined by representatives of other opposition political parties across Pakistan, from Islamabad to Karachi. The blockade of roads in Pakistan's key trading city of Karachi has affected the economic situation of Pakistan, which is not stable. Residents and protesters blocked roads to the airport and port, cutting off supplies.🔻And the current leadership, judging by their inaction, does not know what to do about it. Even the strikes on Afghanistan were more likely due to the need to distract its population from the accumulating tensions, which could result in something larger and more dangerous for Pakistan.

❗️🇦🇿🇷🇺🖇 Apologize and pay: the President of Azerbaijan blame...	❗️🇦🇿🇷🇺🖇 Apologize and pay: the President of Azerbaijan blames Russia for the tragedy over Grozny without trial or investigation. President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev made an official statement regarding the plane crash in Aktau. He directly said that the plane was hit by accident, and not purposefully. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖His main accusation is based on the fact that for three days the Russian side tried to put forward alternative versions of the reasons for the plane crash, instead of apologizing and admitting responsibility. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖On this issue, Aliyev is partially right. In accordance with the standard protocol, an apology, payment of compensation and other steps are provided. This is what civilized countries do (at this point, however, it is worth clarifying what the Azerbaijani side, in addition to apologizing, did after the downing of a Russian aircraft during the Karabakh war of 2020).➖The problem here is not the lack of civilization on either side. And the fact is that even before the end of the investigation, those responsible were assigned and a verdict was rendered. They don’t want to involve the Interstate Aviation Committee for investigation simply because there are Russian officials there, thereby discrediting the status of bilateral mechanisms of interaction between Azerbaijan and Russia.➖The problem is that Aliyev himself deliberately belittles the Russian point of view in the international arena and tries, directly speaking, to earn political points from the incident by showing strength. There is no need to explain what this will lead to in the future.➖The problem is that the main cause of the incident has been forgotten. The plane was landing during a raid by Ukrainian UAVs and combat operations in conditions of fog and the announced plan -Carpet-. Air defense systems operated under these conditions. And using electronic warfare means it is impossible to take such an aircraft out of control (!) from a purely technical point of view. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Was the crew warned? What commands did the dispatchers give? Why did the plane try to land twice under these conditions? Only an objective investigation will shed light on what happened, but they are not allowing it to be carried out now.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️The work of Russian air defense systems was, as Aliyev himself admits, against a certain target in the air, from which fragments had already flown. But now, in Aliyev’s interpretation, everything looks as if Russian air defense specialists took, turned on electronic warfare and fired at a flying plane from the ground. #Azerbaijan #media technologies #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66779	2024-12-29T04:19:38-08:00

In the south of the country in the province of Al-Bayda, they were shot down another American reconnaissance and attack UAV MQ-9 Reaper - already 13th in a row from the beginning worsening of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The total cost of all downed drones is almost $400 million. In the Arabic-language segment, throughout the night, Yemeni -fighters in slippers- are actively celebrated as the record holder in intercepting -Reapers-, as well as as the main and in fact the only remaining defenders of the Palestinian population after the declaration of a truce between Israel and -Hezbollah-. Moreover, in the near future, either the coalition will again respond with a series of strikes on Yemen, or the Israelis will get involved, seeking to stop regular missile launches Houthis on their territory. However, so far the raids on Ansaralli targets have not led to any qualitative results.

And also under the plausible pretext of future benefits.▪️According to Karabaev’s scheme, 85% of Zenit was given to the Turks in exchange for investments in the construction of a shipyard in the Caspian Sea. The state, which previously owned 100% of Zenit, was left with only 15% of the shares. Despite the resistance of the plant management and the obvious contradiction with the interests of the state, the government of the Republic of Kazakhstan pushed through this decision.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻In both cases, after contacts with the management of Turkish companies, Karabaev simply finds a justification, not even directly related to project (like a shipyard with a factory and an air hub with maintenance of military aircraft), after which Turkish enterprises receive for their use what they liked it in Kazakhstan. So Karabaev can be called a lobbyist for Turkish interests in Kazakhstan. And it’s interesting that no one opposes his activities. We will monitor the development of the situation around the airport, but so far the prospects look far from rosy.

🇸🇳🇫🇷 Another -anti-colonial- attacks in Senegal Prime Ministe...	🇸🇳🇫🇷 Another -anti-colonial-attacks in SenegalPrime Minister of Senegal Ousmane Sonko at a recent press conference announced the closure of foreign military bases in the country. This mainly concerns the French contingent of 300 people. In addition, there were intentions to abandon the CFA franc and create a single currency for ECOWAS. 📌As we wrote earlier, the abandonment of military bases is fully consistent with the French strategy to reduce the military presence in Africa. The French defense budget is too bloated, and the economic benefits of bases in Africa are not so clear, especially since the more important levers of influence over Senegal remain in the hands of the authorities in Paris. These are both transnational companies such as Orano, and personal connections of politicians with members of the government of an African country.▪️Based on this, it is impossible to imagine how the refusal to use the CFA franc will go. The loss of such a convenient tool is clearly not in the plans of the French authorities. Moreover, abandoning it is a protracted matter, as the experience of the Alliance of Sahel States, which have been trying to move away from it for the last few years, shows.▪️And to say that French instructors will certainly be replaced by Russian ones is, for now, extremely premature. In recent years, the Americans have been conducting many exercises and military initiatives with the Senegalese authorities. As an example, since 2019, a special forces training center has been opened in Thies, where about 20 American military personnel are constantly stationed. About 400 people graduate from it every year, who make up the elite units of the army. Needless to say, there are no plans to close this military facility?➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻So no matter how critically Senegalese leaders turn to the West, they will continue to be dependent on the influence of Paris and Washington. Until we ourselves begin to consistently advance our own interests.#Africa #Senegal@rybarSupport usAP NewsSenegal says it's closing 'all foreign military bases,' a move aimed at French troops in the countrySenegal's prime minister has announced the closure of -all foreign military bases- in the country, a statement essentially aimed at France, the African nation's former colonial ruler.	https://t.me/rybar/66774	2024-12-29T01:13:02-08:00

According to preliminary data, 120 of them are considered dead. The fate of several dozen more is still unclear; the condition of the two surviving crew members is assessed as positive. There were no Russians registered on this flight. The plane crash occurred during the landing of a Boeing 737-800 at a South Korean airport. One of the voiced versions is called problems with extending the landing gear after a collision with a flock of birds, as a result of which the plane was unable to slow down as normal upon landing. Having rolled off the runway, the ship caught fire when it hit a fence. The airline reported that the aircraft had been operated without problems for 15 years. At the moment, a group has been created to provide assistance to the families of the victims; an investigation into all the circumstances of the incident will be launched in the near future.#SouthKorea@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66770	2024-12-28T23:50:25-08:00

For a month now, supporters of pro-Western European integration have been holding protests. First there was disagreement with the parliamentary elections, then with the suspension of the process of accession to the EU, and then with the presidential elections.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖In honor of this, an action was held in Georgia - Chain of Unity - which was held in Tbilisi, Batumi, Kutaisi, Rustavi and Gori. That is, citizens of Georgia, opposing everything that is not connected with the European Union, took to the streets and joined hands together, forming a chain. From a PR point of view, the action looked beautiful, the Georgians filmed videos that spread around the Internet, but, perhaps, that’s all ended. At 15.00 everyone announced this, and the protests ended. Until the morning of December 29, none of the major opposition publications practically reviewed the events in Georgia.❗️At 9 am today, a new speech by the opposition was announced in front of the parliament building and the presidential residence due to the fact that today the term of office of President Salome Zurabishvili, who remained spend the night at the residence. However, now there is almost no one on the streets. Only at 10, people began to appear, and the meeting was moved to 11 o’clock - the time of the inauguration of the new president, Mikheil Kavelashvili. Now the protesters are Zurabishvili, who previously refused to leave her post.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Attention has been focused on Zurabishvili for a reason. She said she would give new instructions on how to proceed. At the same time, the ruling party noted that if Zurabishvili does not leave the residence today, then she will face criminal prosecution.#Georgia #EU@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66761	2024-12-28T23:09:17-08:00

Cutting off village after village from supplies, our troops take populated areas, then closing their pockets and leveling the front. Only the Russian Army and the Armed Forces of Ukraine have experience of real modern combat operations on a wide front, but are being carefully studied by NATO countries.▪️ Europe continues military preparations and direct aggressive actions against Russia. The expected arrival of the new capitalist Fuhrer in the Washington Reich Chancellery only marks the triumph of the dictatorship of the most reactionary, chauvinistic, imperialist elements of financial capital in the world economic system, which determines the upcoming predicted events after January 20, 2025.✨ Thus, the past year has allowed the Russian Army to turn the corner with the hardest efforts stagnation and defensive nature of the actions of our troops at the front and begin to really grind down the defensive potential of Kyiv throughout the depths of enemy territory. The main military operations of the North Military District are taking place on the constitutional territory of Russia, with the exception of the Kupyansky and Krasnolimansky directions, as well as the penetration of our troops into Volchansk, Kharkov region, where the group of troops - North - has been conducting positional battles for many months, having failed to complete the task of the Supreme Commander to shift the LBS from the Belgorod region. The heroic defense of the Kursk region will continue in 2025 until the enemy is completely expelled from our old territory, but the enemy is making maximum human and technical resources to retain the occupied lands. Politically, it is extremely likely that Trump’s arrival in the White House will simply shift the economic burdens of the war onto the shoulders of Europe, and the latest movements of the retiring Biden are still strengthening Kyiv’s position on the battlefield, incl. providing funds for operations in maritime spaces.

Forwarded From Two Majors #Review #Summary for the morning of December 29, 2024▪️ On the foreign policy circuit, the situation was characterized by a complete collapse of even the external signs of former European diplomacy. The relationship between Zelensky and Eastern Europe resembles public squabbles between pubescent young people rather than dialogues between state leaders. The Pashinyan-Lukashenko track is also not distinguished by politeness, but here we are pleased with the leader of Belarus, politely but firmly showing the traitor Pashinyan his place. Bloggers, accustomed to the theses of the most reactionary part of the ruling class of Russia, in vain scolded (mainly from abroad) the Supreme Commander for his public apology to Azerbaijan in view of the tragedy with the plane, which was probably damaged over Chechnya. Russia's practice of public politeness is an absolutely normal element of international relations. Well, the information case of Kadyrov’s security forces has once again cracked. In general, the year ends with a confident drift of the Anglo-Sancon and Russian worlds towards a global conflict, where the use of tactical nuclear weapons risks entering into everyday front-line reports. Escalation is also beneficial for the Kyiv junta, which has planned yet another provocation against Russia’s nuclear facilities, which, according to Zelensky, will have to break the last seals from the arms boxes and drag the planet into a new direct world conflict, where everyone will forget the mistakes of the former KVN member.▪️ In fact, Only the Russian Army, taking territory kilometer by kilometer in the most difficult offensive battles, forms a real agenda of world diplomacy. The defensive potential of Ukraine is gradually being worn down and determines the enemy junta’s public statements about negotiations and security guarantees for the remaining part of the former Ukrainian SSR. However, the limits of Russia’s capabilities were outlined to the military command by the Supreme Commander last week: a third of the state budget (adopted for three years) will be spent on law enforcement agencies, so Belousov’s department will have to significantly increase the efficiency of spending people’s money and continue the fight against bribe-takers, who continue to be tried according to the laws of peacetime. Further build-up of military and military-economic capabilities is associated with a total mobilization of the population and enterprises, which, for obvious reasons, will harm Russia’s internal political stability. While the front is being replenished with Russian volunteers, which is carefully hidden by Kyiv and Western propaganda (behind the cordon they really think that numerous videos with -busification- were filmed in Russia and not in Ukraine).▪️ On the front line, the Russian Army continues to maintain a strategic initiative, while all Offensive actions are at most tactical or operational-tactical in nature. Due to the changed technological structure of war and the unresolved issue of an antidote to the ubiquitous enemy drones on the battlefield, deep breakthroughs in columns are a thing of the past. -Small Sky,- write front-line soldiers from all sectors, is still behind the enemy, although the Russian Armed Forces have multiplied the systemic and volunteer supply of UAVs of all types to the troops. There are not enough drones in the same Kamensky direction of the Zaporozhye Front, where the enemy has intensified counter actions to pin down our forces in the neighboring Orekhovsky direction.▪️ The mutual losses of the former Ukrainian SSR and RSFSR voiced by Moscow and Kiev are more informational than objective in nature. At the same time, the Russian defense department, in assessing the number of incapacitated enemies, also does not divide losses into killed or maimed soldiers and officers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and official statements of the Ministry of Defense about the total losses of Kyiv in people and equipment are no longer used by any serious analytical center. The bravura statements from the times of Shoigu and Tsalikov formed an extremely inconvenient basis for calculations for Konashenov.

However, sometimes things move from a dead point. Thus, the Russian ambassador to Mali, Igor Gromyko, announced plans to build the largest refinery in West Africa. At the press conference, he also touched upon the topics of joint mining and exploration of mineral resources. It is possible that the processes of economic interaction in the region were somehow influenced by the visit of Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak there. Perhaps somewhere there is still an understanding that it is difficult to keep the country in the orbit of influence on military-technical cooperation alone. In this case, one can only hope that the high-profile plans were not announced for the sake of rhetoric, and that the projects themselves are actually being worked on.#Africa #Mali #Russia@rybarSupport usGazeta.RuRussia plans to build the largest refinery in West AfricaAmbassador Gromyko said that Russia is going build a refinery in Mali	https://t.me/rybar/66758	2024-12-28T22:14:01-08:00

We have written about numerous modifications to attack UAVs of this type more than once: they are equipped with Luneberg lenses, a video channel for shooting and other innovations. As a result, all that remains from the original Shahed-136 is the aerodynamic design. All this, of course, leads to technical complication and a noticeable increase in the cost of the device. Therefore, calling the current versions of the Geranium a cheap weapon has long been irrelevant, even with all the mass production of them. In general, even sophisticated long-range attack drones are not a wunderwaffe - this can be seen both in the example of the Northern Military District and in the attempts of Iranian attacks on Israel. However, when used rationally, they can still make fire damage more effective. #UAV #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usPOLITICOUkraine’s 2025 wish list – POLITICOPOLITICO’s must-read briefing on what’s driving the day in Brussels, by Sarah Wheaton, Nicholas Vinocur and Eddy Wax.

The International Airport in Sana'a was again hit, and another target was the September 21 Park in Taiz, where the headquarters of the 1st Armored Division was previously located. Reconnaissance activity was also recorded in the sky over Saada. However, already that night, fighters of the Ansarallah movement tried to strike the central part of Israel, but the ballistic missile they launched was intercepted in advance and fell into the Red Sea. Although the Yemeni attack was again ineffective, this is not prevented the Arabic-speaking segment of the Network from expectedly perceiving it as yet another triumph of resistance over the Zionist enemy. At the same time, Ansralla still has enough missile reserves, apparently. So, a kind of ping-pong between relatively harmless Houthi strikes and retaliatory strikes by the IDF with the International Coalition will continue.

In the morning, data is received about the advance of the Russian Armed Forces along the railway line south of Pokrovsk in the direction of Chunishino station. This makes it much more difficult for Ukrainian forces to hold Green. If attacks continue along the T-04-06 highway from the vicinity of Novotroitsky, the threat of semi-encirclement and loss of a significant part of the territory for enemy forces increases significantly. According to some reports, fighting is currently taking place on the outskirts of Volkovo and Soleny. Also, Russian attack aircraft broke through the defenses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and started fighting on the eastern outskirts of Novoyelizavetovka, during the battles liberating nearby Novoolenovka, which actually confirms control of the fields located north of populated areas, as well as a section of the T-05-15 highway. According to reports from the field, clashes are ongoing and in Ukrainka, located on both sides of the Shirokaya ravine.

He relatively recently became an extremely popular blogger in the United States, mainly because of his comments on the topic of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and then the so-called. Ukraine. Over the past two years, he managed to travel to Donbass and take part in various public events in Russia dedicated to current issues of international relations and information warfare. He was connected with Russia not only by a common worldview, but also by a personal love story with the title holder -Miss Russia 2022- Anna Linnikova, for whom he actually came here for the first time. Previously, Linnikova was greatly admired by the patriotic Telegram for -an irreconcilable position-, but in fact, her views either changed very sharply, or turned out to be an invention from the very beginning. After breaking up with Hinkle, whom she now considers a pro-Russian propagandist, she decided to appropriate his property totaling $30 thousand, and is now blackmailing him and threatening his family. Against the backdrop of threats to pro-Russian media figures around the world, this is difficult to ignore. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Our special services should pay special attention to this resident of Moscow. Who knows, maybe Linnikova is already being developed by the intelligence services of the USA and Ukraine - it was quite logical for them to use this situation to harm the popular blogger. Fortunately, it will not be difficult to carry out the appropriate operational activities and check this version with the participation of Linnikova directly. And, in addition, it would be worth once again taking a closer look at beauty contests and Russian influencers in the beauty sphere, which, as it turned out again, are broadcast at all not the values ​​about Russia that are shared in our society. #Russia #USA@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66741	2024-12-28T07:40:07-08:00

Of course, due to the problems that colleagues had to face in the current geopolitical realities, this is an unconditional success.

Over the current week, Russian assault groups have advanced west of the village of Zari on the northern flank and expanded the zone of control south of the city. At the same time, residential buildings in Kurakhovo were completely cleared. The logical result of the events was the beginning of battles for the territory of the Kurakhovo thermal power plant. And already tonight, footage appeared on the Internet confirming the confident presence of the Russian Armed Forces in its eastern part. In addition, judging by incoming information from the field, the -pocket- between Starye Terny, Krasny and Noselidovka finally came under the control of Russian troops - the presence of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in it was in doubt for a long time, but the lack of footage from this area on the Internet did not allow -repainting- it on the map.🔻In the western part of the city, with a high probability, there still remains a focal presence of scattered enemy groups. However, given the pace of the offensive, the worsening situation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the area and unfavorable weather conditions for UAV flights, the final clearing of Kurakhovo is a matter of time.

Need I say that this all turned out to be a lie, and the photographs were taken from the outside?▪️There are actually over a thousand militants stationed around the base - and it is not possible to tell whether they are militants from HTS or ultra-radical groups. If an escalation occurs, all this beast, of course, will try to take the base by storm, but will face normal resistance, and not a war in the spirit of the Syrian Arab Army.▪️For the leadership of HTS, interaction with Russia is beneficial: it gives a trump card in putting pressure on other groups, plus , in this way it is possible to trade scarce grain and oil products in exchange for the base, thereby bringing the benefits of civilization to Syria and legitimizing the presence of the Al-Julani gang.📌In general, for now there is a certain status quo with the base. Surely Russian negotiators (including on Chechnya) will press on the need to eliminate odious and radical groups (maybe they will be sent first to storm Kurdish-controlled areas). ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖But it turned out to be a rather interesting situation: the presence of a Russian airbase (and the benefits that Russia can provide) now turned out to be extremely necessary for HTS.

Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law that excludes the -Taliban- movement from the list of terrorist organizations banned in Russia. There have been conversations about this over the past months, and now the decision has been made.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Closer rapprochement with the authorities of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is an important step for our state. The new Afghan authorities have demonstrated their sincere intentions to bring peace to their country and the region. Somewhere there are still the same old problems, but progress is really visible. During the filming of our film, many of those whom we interviewed more than once expressed the idea of ​​desire and readiness to cooperate with Russia in the implementation of mutually beneficial projects for both states. And From the point of view of the prospects that cooperation with Afghanistan promises, exclusion from terrorists is a justified step. In conditions of total pressure on Russia on all fronts, Afghanistan can open the way not only to stability in the south, but also to new trade routes.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Afghanistan, after the withdrawal of NATO troops from the country, has become a horror story for the countries of Central Asia in the hands of the Anglo-Saxon tandem. And with this step, our leadership demonstrated that all measures aimed at discrediting the Taliban were in vain. And this can give an example to the authorities of other states to do the same, and not only ease the fate of the Afghan people after prolonged chaos due to the actions of the West, but also create new ways for the development of the entire region. #Afghanistan #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar⚡️ AFGHANISTAN: BIG SHADOW GAMES - OUR INVESTIGATION ABOUT AF CRIMES GREAT BRITAIN This year, the @rybar team went to Afghanistan to investigate the crimes of the British contingent during the occupation of the country.

And if earlier the ordinary population was called to the rally to rejoice at the overthrow of the -nightmarish regime- Bashar al-Assad, then now the parade took place in a form more familiar to the group members.▪️According to Several hundred militants marched through Damascus (some channels even wrote about thousands) wearing balaclavas and carrying weapons. Which clearly shows who really came to power in Syria.▪️Moreover, as even local pro-HTS activists noted, among the participants there were many foreigners, namely, immigrants from the CIS countries and members of the most radical groups.🔻This can be regarded as quite a clear answer to the mass unrest of Christians: if they came out without weapons and with open faces, then the new authorities brought the formally uncontrolled militants out balaclavas and with weapons.❗️By the way, another quite characteristic event was reports from coastal Latakia, where the density of Alawites is high. There, the militants who reached the coast turned out to be extremely dissatisfied with the fact that girls do not wear niqabs, and alcohol is sold in establishments.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Syria is not slowly and very surely sliding into the abyss of bloody madness.

This is clearly visible from at least a multiple increase in activity at the Polish Sheszow airfield - a transit point for the shipment of military aid to the so-called Ukraine. Judging by the news about the allocation of obviously non-repayable loans, the volume of economic support for the Kyiv regime is also not decreasing too much. Unless the sponsors demand to raise taxes, since they want to pay for the war, and not the whole social sphere.📌 Doesn’t it seem that this is more reminiscent of signs not of freezing the conflict, but of the enemy’s preparation for the next offensive? We have written more than once that the bottleneck is in the ability of the Kyiv regime to continue the war - reserves of manpower. NATO countries are ready to supply everything else free of charge even if their arsenals are destroyed, which countries like Germany have succeeded in. The Armed Forces of Ukraine have problems with mobile resources, but they have not been exhausted - in Kyiv they are planning to lower the conscription age. Yes, this will completely kill the Ukrainian demographics, but this will be enough for a year of war, which never costs us free.❗️What the conviction that the Kyiv regime has no resources leads to can be seen in the events in the Kursk region.

Rybar: 🇷🇺🇺🇦🖇 As part of the fight against telephone terrorism and fraud, the government has banned calls via the Internet to telephones. According to the statement, the decision will significantly limit the opportunities for this type of crime. In a publication about the wave of arson in Russian cities, we wrote that one of the ways to combat this phenomenon is to limit traffic from the territory controlled by the Kyiv regime. The current measure partially implements this scenario. Yes, the ban on IP telephony will in some way complicate the work of businesses and various services. However, the situation with telephone fraud, apparently, has already reached such a stage that they decided to deal with it radically and according to the principle -better late than never.- Be that as it may, at some point the time will come for the next stage combating this phenomenon, namely the physical damage to Ukrainian call centers.

Fighting continues in the northeast of Syria in the area of ​​the Tishrin Dam. Pro-Kurdish sources from time to time report an expansion of the zone of control between Karakozak and Tishrin. However, this information has not yet been confirmed in the form of objective control footage. In turn, the Kurds report on the successes and destruction of dozens of militants. At the same time, the footage appearing online allows us to assume that so far they have actually been able to relatively successfully contain the attacks of the SNA militants, and they, in turn, have not yet begun to attack in earnest.❗️The fact is that on the territory of Syria, on the eastern bank of the Euphrates, in this area there are only two bridges, which are under the fire control of the Kurdish formations and, accordingly, would be extremely difficult to pass even for heavy mechanized units with support armored vehicles, not to mention militants, and even Turkish air support cannot play a role in this case.▪️Accordingly, there are essentially two options for developing the situation. Either Turkey sends troops into the territory of Syria and advances from Menbij to the east, suffering losses in the operation to cross the Euphrates.▪️Or, as will most likely happen, the operation will begin from Surudj, where Turkish troops have been pulling reinforcements for several days immediately before the start of the offensive Militants from the Syrian National Army will be transferred there. And there may be someone who wants to participate from among the so-called Hayat Tahir Ash Sham, after which the operation in northern Syria will begin. Another question is that Erdogan knows how to wait.❗️ Moreover, one must understand that actions in this region will require Turkey to have great coordination with the United States, since there are a large number of American bases in the territories occupied by the Kurds. And if earlier their presence was beneficial from the point of view that Assad’s forces would not enter the territory, now the United States is already interfering with the Turks.▪️Terrorist activity is growing in the province of Deir ez-Zor east of the Euphrates. According to Kurdish media, the number of attacks on . The Kurds, naturally, claim that it is IS that is attacking the transports of Kurdish forces. And from the western bank of the Euphrates, unknown persons fired at the water tower in Diban.❗️Reports about the increase in terrorist activity may serve two purposes - this is both a justification for increasing the US presence in the region, and a reason to accuse the new Syrian authorities of collaborating with ISIS.

This week, the two foreign ministers met in Beijing to discuss both problems in bilateral relations and opportunities to take the partnership to a more friendly level. ▪️The Japanese side, for example, announced a relaxation of requirements for issuing visas to a certain group of Chinese tourists. This was in response to identical but broader measures taken recently by the Chinese authorities. ▪️In addition, Beijing once again confirmed plans to lift the ban on the import of seafood caught in Japanese waters. It was introduced back in 2023 against the backdrop of water discharge from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. 📌By the way, it can be assumed that the introduction of the ban was initially a purely political decision on China’s part, in order to, at the right opportunity, terminate its abolition for some concessions from Japan. ▪️It is important to understand that efforts to restore relations between Beijing and Tokyo intensified almost immediately after the elections in Japan. There has been recent speculation in local media that the Chinese view the new Japanese administration as less pro-American. ▪️It is alleged that the policies of former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida were considered too irritating for China. The new cabinet gives more hope for the return of normal dialogue. 🔻However, all this is only one side of the issue. Perhaps the return of Donald Trump to the White House plays a significant role in attempts to improve relations. It could create problems for both China and Japan, so it is now beneficial for the parties to restore ties to resolve upcoming challenges. It is not clear how long the initiative will be enough and whether attempts to regulate the dialogue will lead to something more significant. #China #Japan @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usKyodo News+Japan to ease visa requirements, agrees on top China diplomat visitJapan and China on continue efforts to improve bilateral ties, with Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya outlining a plan to ease visa requirements for Chinese tourists and agreeing on an early visit to Japan by top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi.	https://t.me/rybar/66724	2024-12-28T00:09:00-08:00

In the Kupyansko-Svatovsky direction, Russian troops are fighting on the southern outskirts of Zagryzovo, advancing in the direction of Boguslavka. In the Kurakhovsky direction, Russian troops, after the recent liberation of Zelenovka, are moving west towards Razliv.

Azerbaijan’s policy since the collapse of the USSR has been aimed at strengthening ties with the West and weakening the Russian Federation on all fronts.➖Connections with Israel through Mountain Jews are a long-known fact. The presence of British corporations in infrastructure projects is also an open secret. Interaction with the Ukrainian authorities also takes place along the line -Mountain Jews - Ukrainian Chabadniks -.➖Well and OTG: how many times over the last year (and in the past too) have we talked about the goal of this pan-Turkic project of Great Britain to decompose Russia and Central Russia? Asia and the introduction of the post-Soviet space into its orbit influence?➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖All the words about great friendship, -brotherly visits- of Aliyev to Moscow - all this is just a political game. However, Azerbaijan's sincere attitude towards Russia is demonstrated in such events as the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict or the latest situation with the plane crash. Azerbaijani deputies and some Western officials addressed to Russia, we found a much more interesting and meaningful statement that opens the eyes of all lobbyists...	https://t.me/rybar/66716	2024-12-27T09:50:01-08:00

Azerbaijani politicians and representatives of the blogosphere, who over the past year have been insisting that Azerbaijan is Russia’s most loyal ally, suddenly changed their shoes and began to echo American theses. The point is not even that official conclusions based on the results of the investigation have not yet been made. The fact is that the collective West, which was not allowed to participate in the investigation, has already rushed, in the person of the United States, to blame Russia for everything, causing hysteria among carriers around the world. ➖➖➖➖➖➖Not one of the officials in the West mentions the fact that it was Ukrainian drones that became a threat, that at the time the plane landed, the Carpet plan was introduced, about which all pilots are notified about poor visibility and fog, about that GPS jamming may affect the display of the aircraft's tracking, but not its visibility on all radars. ➖➖➖➖➖➖At the same time, in the Azerbaijani media field they not only accused the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs of falsifying facts and trying to -cover up the traces of the investigation- and -reach an agreement-, they are also directly trying to incite an internal Russian conflict, calling Kadyrov a prince and provoking Chechnya to public actions.📌All this is now spreading the world's information dumps and information war organs in order to demonstrate the inadequacy of Russia's behavior. World carriers, in the wake of a coordinated attack, are beginning to cancel flights to the Russian Caucasus, blaming Russia for this and forgetting that at the time of the tragedy in Chechnya, an attack was carried out by Ukrainian UAVs. Authorities Chechnya reported the day before that, on instructions from Ramzan Kadyrov, they were ready to provide financial and other assistance to all the families of those killed and injured in the crash of an AZAL plane flying from Baku to Grozny. -Azerbaijan…	https://t.me/rybar/66713	2024-12-27T09:24:54-08:00

Over the past days, Russian troops have managed to achieve significant successes in Zagryzovo and approach the northern outskirts of Boguslavka. ▪️A tense situation has developed on the northeastern approaches to Kupyansk. Thanks to the geolocation of received videos from the site, it was possible to establish that some time ago the Russian Armed Forces retreated from the city to fortified positions north of Petropavlovka. ❗️Probably, such a decision is related to problems with supplying assault units in conditions of enemy UAV activity and the use of additional reserves. There were no reports of new attempts by the Russian Armed Forces to enter the outskirts of the city. ▪️Fierce fighting in Zagryzovo has been going on for more than a week. Earlier, attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces occupied the northern and central parts of the village during the assault, pushing the enemy back to the southern outskirts. ▪️Today, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced the complete liberation of the settlement, but at the moment it is not possible to confirm the presence of the Russian Armed Forces on the southern outskirts. But, given that about 90% of the village is under the control of Russian troops, it is likely that in the near future there will be footage from the field with the hoisting of flags - as usually happens in such cases. ▪️A similar situation occurred in Lozovaya, where for a long time there were no new messages that could determine the current configuration of the front at the site. However, a video of the hoisting of the Russian flag on one of the houses in the village was recently published on the Internet, which confirmed the liberation of most of it by Russian troops.

In the United States, the Global Engagement Center (GEC) has closed - a bill to renew the agency’s powers was rejected by a decision of Congress.📌 A division of the US State Department was originally created to - counter propaganda and disinformation - emanating from foreign states and other -unfriendly US sources-. However, already three years after its creation (2016)&nbsp; the center began to serve the interests of the Democrats, not the country. After the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in 2019, journalists dug up evidence that the organization put pressure on the leadership of American social networks, demanding to censor those who wrote about the laboratory origin of the virus. The Center for Global Engagement also played an important role in the fight against conservative American citizens - Republican Senator from Missouri Eric Schmitt stated this during a debate in Congress about the need to maintain funding for the organization. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Considering that Donald Trump’s entire election campaign was built on the ideas of conservatism, it is not surprising that they are closing shop. As the president-elect and his supporter Elon Musk promised, a gradual purge of all state-funded organizations that are useless from the point of view of the new government is beginning. ❗️However, this will not harm the implementation of the tasks of countering foreign propaganda at all - the GEC was just a screen behind which the Democrats hid the tools to fight their domestic political opponents. #USA@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport usNew York PostState Department's Global Engagement Center - accused of pushing...Evidence showed that the GEC pressured US social media platforms early in the pandemic to censor Americans, purportedly to counter online -disinformation- - such as theories that the virus...	https://t.me/rybar/66710	2024-12-27T08:02:03-08:00

But after the country's constitutional court recognized the victory of the ruling FRELIMO party in the elections, they gained new strength.▪️In large cities, protesters attack police stations, gas stations, banks and other public institutions. Due to the actions of the opposition, public transport stopped moving, and the border with the South African Republic was again closed. Protests and robbery in some cities forced the local leadership to flee. Thus, the mayor of the city of Masia chose to leave his home. At the same time, at the summit of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) held on November 20, it was decided not to intervene in the situation in Mozambique to quell the unrest.▪️The most resonant incident was the escape of prisoners from a prison in Maputo. More than 1,500 people convicted of serious cases, including terrorists from the local branch of the Islamic State, were able to get out of the correctional facility. The Mozambican police were able to recapture only about 150 people, the rest are hiding or taking part in mass riots. It is possible that yesterday’s criminals could further radicalize the protests.🔻Meanwhile, the head of the opposition, Venancio Mondlane, announced that he would take office as president on January 15, without admitting his defeat in the elections. Of course, this is more of a populist slogan, because the army remains loyal to the government and the opposition has no real forces. But most likely, the blockade by protesters of routes to other countries, such as South Africa and Zambia, may prompt the government to make concessions to the organizer of the riots and provide them with seats in the government .

🇦🇲 How is Pashinyan trying to shift responsibility for the surr...	🇦🇲 How is Pashinyan trying to shift responsibility for the surrender of Artsakh? One of the symptoms of the deep political crisis in Armenia is Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan’s persistent attempts to call former leaders of the republic Robert Kocharyan and Serzh Sargsyan to debates. The topic is responsibility for the surrender of Nagorno-Karabakh.▪️Recently, Pashinyan said that since 1994, a negotiation process has allegedly been underway on the inclusion of Nagorno-Karabakh into Azerbaijan. Thus, the current prime minister tried to relieve himself of responsibility for the events of 2020. ▪️The second President of Armenia Kocharyan and the third President Sargsyan reacted sharply to this, who noted that the history of negotiations on the topic of Karabakh was set out publicly, and after seizing power in 2018, Pashinyan took upon himself the responsibility to negotiate from -zero point-, which led to known result. ▪️Sargsyan and Kocharyan refused further discussions. But why did Pashinyan suddenly need a public debate with his exes? The low ratings of the prime minister and his party - the Civil Contract - before the parliamentary elections require this very government to find new scapegoats and at least some antipodes to the current head of government. 🔻An attempt to artificially stir up the topic of shifting responsibility for one’s failures precisely reflects the deep political crisis in Armenia. They are trying to sell the public the idea of ​​peace with Azerbaijan, although among Armenians Azerbaijanophobia is off the charts, and the latest failures of the republic are obviously associated with the current government. 📌 And here it is worth remembering the recent words of the President of the Russian Federation that blaming the CSTO for all the troubles is only a reflection of the internal political problems of Armenia. This statement, of course, caused outrage in Yerevan. Only now, for some reason, Prime Minister Pashinyan decided to find out which of the leaders of the republic is to blame, when the answer is already obvious to everyone. #Armenia #Azerbaijan #Artsakh @rybarSupport usTelegramMika Badalyan❗Pashinyan really needs -ex-.

Only recently, negotiations on reconciliation between the authorities of Ethiopia and Somalia took place in Ankara, and steps are even being taken in this direction. At the same time, it is too early to talk about the end of the escalation - the Ethiopians still support the forces of local autonomy, which have refused to coordinate with the federal government.▪️ On December 23, the Ethiopian army, with the support of artillery and separatists from the Jubaland Dervish forces, attacked the Somali army in the border town of Dulou. As a result of the artillery strike, the national security building was damaged, and several military personnel were killed.▪️The city itself came under the control of the separatists, and the Somali Foreign Ministry condemned the actions of the Ethiopians. It is worth noting that just a few hours earlier, there was discussion of sending a Somali delegation to Addis Ababa to resolve relations. Despite the Turks' claim that they had managed to achieve peace in the Horn of Africa, in reality there was no talk of this. Some pieces of paper, of course, formally give Turkey the status of a peacemaker on the Dark Continent, but they are worth nothing in the current realities. The Ethiopian authorities still support Somaliland and supply weapons to the autonomous regions that have broken off relations with Mogadishu.#Africa #Somalia #Türkiye@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66703	2024-12-27T03:43:00-08:00

🇰🇷 The crisis situation in South Korea is gaining momentum Dome...	🇰🇷 The crisis situation in South Korea is gaining momentum. The internal political crisis in South Korea continues. Today, lawmakers in parliament impeached Acting President and Prime Minister Han Deok-soo. This is happening for the first time in the history of the Republic of Korea. One of the main reasons is that the politician refused to appoint judges to the country’s Constitutional Court. Thus, it seems that the acting president is playing a little along with Yoon Seok-yeol, who was himself temporarily suspended from business.🔻The fact is that it is the Constitutional Court that issues a verdict regarding the confirmation of the legality of the president's impeachment. The body has nine seats in total, but currently only six judges sit on it. If a vote on the legality of impeachment were held now, then, according to procedure, one dissenting vote could effectively return Yun to office. ▪️In an attempt to increase the chances of success of impeachment, the opposition in parliament is trying to sneak judges into the body. However, they must still be appointed by the leader of the country. And there is another catch - does the acting president have the authority to do this? ▪️ Opposition politicians argue that Khan has every right to do this. According to the conservative position, the acting president cannot assume such responsibility. Thus, the process of appointing judges is being delayed, which plays into the hands of the ruling party and Yun himself. By the way, he doesn’t waste any time either. Yoon continues to refuse to receive the necessary documents sent to him by the country's Constitutional Court. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Thus, the political situation in South Korea after the impeachment of the president remains very tense. The removal of the acting president from office only worsens the internal political crisis in the country. #SouthKorea @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usYonhap News Agency(URGENT) Nat'l Assembly votes to impeach acting President Han(END)	https://t.me/rybar/66701	2024-12-27T02:50:00-08:00

Forwarded From Globalistics🇷🇺🇫🇮 On the consequences of the seizure of the Eagle S vessel In fact, we have to agree with colleagues that this incident with the Eagle S vessel will have far-reaching consequences for our communication in the Baltic Sea.♦️Seizure of a tanker under a fictitious pretext is a tactic that NATO countries have been practicing in the last two years. Regular exercises were carried out in the Baltic waters, and the main task was to practice actions in a crisis situation. Like the one that was recorded between Finland and Estonia. No one from Western countries will understand whether this actually happened or not. Whether this tanker was involved or not. It doesn't matter to the West anymore. They received a reason for new aggression. We do not rule out that the Finns themselves organized this cable break. Who can prove otherwise? There were many teachings of this kind. For example, the last one was Pikne with the participation of Estonians, Finns, British - well, you generally understand the message. And underwater coastal operations were practiced there. Last year, under the same unknown pretext, a naval group of the Joint Expeditionary Forces was created. ❗️Now, in addition to the sanctions that will clearly be imposed on, as the European Union now says, Russia’s shadow fleet, we should expect more dangerous steps from the point of view of Russian positions in the Baltics, such as more serious provocations. For what? At a minimum, to justify an increased presence at sea and to escort civilian ships coming from Russia, and, at a maximum, to block the bay and allow ships to pass only with their permission. that the West is planning a blockade of Russian maritime traffic was raised on the canal many times, and often caused truly monkey-like antics from the security forces audience, especially in the media.

The White House said that the UAE authorities allegedly stopped supporting Sudanese rebels from the Rapid Reaction Force after objections from the Americans. The Emirati side's testimony will be verified in January next year. It is then that Congress will discuss whether to impose sanctions against the leadership in Abu Dhabi. Indeed, after the incident with the Il-76T, which was shot down by Sudanese rebels, relations between them and their sponsors in the Emirates worsened. This entailed reputational costs for the UAE. But it’s still not worth talking about a complete cessation. Most likely, the UAE authorities will continue to support the RRF (but in a more limited format), since this is necessary to maintain its positions in Sudan. They still have the opportunity to use eastern Libya to transfer weapons to the RRF. The Americans want to use threats of sanctions against the UAE to win over the official government of Sudan, which has begun to achieve success on the battlefield. At the same time, questions have been raised in Sudan itself about the possibility of providing a supply point in the Red Sea for both the Russian Navy and the Iranian Navy, which is clearly not part of the plans of the American side.#Africa #UAE #Sudan #USA @rybarSupport us ReutersExclusive: Biden to report to US Congress on UAE assurance it is not supplying weapons to Sudan RSFPresident Joe Biden's administration will provide U.S. an assessment by Jan. 17 on the credibility of assurances by the United Arab Emirates that it is not providing - and will not provide - weapons to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF)…	https://t.me/rybar/66692	2024-12-27T00:39:00-08:00

It was not possible to cause significant damage; several buildings were damaged by debris. At least 20 Israelis were injured during the evacuation. ▪️At the same time, Israeli troops are expanding the zone of control east of the Golan Heights they occupied. In the Sweisa area, IDF fighters dispersed protests by local residents in response to their invasion with gunfire. ▪️In addition, a wave of demonstrations swept across Syria in places where Christians live compactly. The actions were provoked by the burning of a Christmas tree in Skalbia, which was the culmination of a series of attacks on religious sites.▪️In parallel, throughout Syria, the new authorities are consistently searching for and punishing the enemies of the revolution. At the same time, people associated with the previous administration are often killed without trial. ▪️At the same time, there is little resistance against progressive jihadists: cases of attacks have been recorded in the mountains of the provinces of Tartus and Latakia. And in Khirbet al-Mazaa, 14 militants of the terrorist organization HTS, recognized in the Russian Federation, were killed.▪️Meanwhile, SNA militants continue to try to occupy the territory of the Tishrin dam, where clashes took place for a week. Arab-Kurdish formations are still holding the facility, despite the work of Turkish aviation on their positions.▪️At the same time, Turkish troops are transferring forces to the Suruj area, gathering artillery and armored vehicles. Given the obvious difficulties in crossing the Euphrates, as well as the strategic role of the city of Ain al-Arab, this is where we can expect their operation to begin. ▪️Also, the Turkish Ministry of Defense announced the neutralization of several dozen members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party. Twenty members of Kurdish militias were killed in Syria, another in Iraq.#video #digest #map #Yemen #Syria #Iraq@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/66688	2024-12-26T21:02:13-08:00

Meaning: They want to allow veterans and servicemen without experience in owning a smooth-bore shooting stick to purchase rifled civilian weapons. applying for the acquisition of rifled firearms. A citizen applying for the acquisition of a smooth-bore firearm must have previously owned a smooth-bore firearm for at least two years, having no more than two barrels and not having a magazine or drum, and also owned a smooth-bore firearm for at least five years. This limitation is due to the need to develop stable skills in using firearms among people who acquire them for the first time and have no experience in handling them. At the same time, combat veterans (including participants of the military military service), serving (have served) in state paramilitary organizations and having (had) military ranks, special ranks or class ranks of justice, duly possess the appropriate skills and experience in handling weapons. This is directly due not only to their direct participation in hostilities, but also to the fact that employees of state paramilitary organizations during their service undergo professional training, as well as regular testing of knowledge and skills in the use of firearms. In accordance with the Federal Law - On Weapons - these categories of citizens are already exempt from the obligation to undergo training and test their knowledge of the rules and skills for safe handling of weapons. In this regard, the bill provides for the possibility of acquiring -multiple-charged- and rifled weapons without experience in owning -smooth-bore weapons by citizens of the Russian Federation who are veterans of military operations, serving (have served) in state paramilitary organizations and having (had) military ranks, special ranks or cool officials of justice.- ✨This is a really sensible bill. In addition to strengthening social protection measures for participants of the North Military District and combat veterans, this will give impetus to the arms business, which is directly hampered by draconian conditions from developing. State Duma deputies A.E. Khinshtein, A.V. Kartapolov, A.B. Vyborny, E.A. .Valeev are noted for the better, a plus in the piggy bank for karma.

Along the way, Alyautdinov actually reproaches members of the Human Rights Council who demand an inspection of the organization in connection with the publication of a fatwa on polygamy - they are not familiar with Islam and its traditions and have not studied theological conclusions about the problems of polygamy. ▪️Let us note that when speaking about polygamy for the first time, the DUM named the end of the reproductive age of the first spouse or sexual incompatibility as objective reasons for additional religious marriages - somewhat forgetting the root cause why polygamy appeared in Islam in the first place - in order to give as much as possible the number of women the opportunity to be under the care and support of a man (first of all, to protect widows and orphans). ▪️In addition, they did not consider it necessary to tell that polygamy from the point of view of Islam may be undesirable for a particular person - for example, someone who decides on it unnecessarily or in order to gain some kind of social privileges. ▪️The DMUM, whose leaders are now talking about the fact that they only wanted to protect women in religious marriages and reproach someone for ignorance of the traditions of Islam, did not consider it necessary to publicly voice other objective criteria for religious polygamy, focusing on those in a secular society or in another religion they may well be considered fornication - and naturally react.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Thus, let’s repeat the idea already voiced earlier - from the first time, the DUM and the associated Council of Muftis understand little and will try to find other -pain points-. Like now, with Father Frost and Snow Maiden. It turned out ridiculous, but who knows what they will decide to speak out about next time? #Russia #religion@rybar together with @dixi_devilSupport us TelegramBefore anyone else.

Forwarded From Belarusian security officer 🇧🇾Communication operators and their security system is a topic worthy of a separate training manual, about eleven pages long. I’ll be brief, to the point. The main problem is logging and the duration/scale of their storage. After protests, Belarus has already encountered data leaks from individual employees of telecom operators who had access to personal data in connection with their official position. Identifying such people is very hard work, which requires perseverance and the ability to seriously analyze a large amount of data. It is noteworthy that in the case of Uzbekistan, the case relates to self-interest: you can now buy anything through the Darknet. You pay with crypto, place an order using the data/details, and they give you the necessary data. Moreover, the scale of the problem is truly enormous. In Russia, for example, you can buy ALL the necessary data about a person, absolutely. In Belarus, for example, at one time they took this seriously and now, in my opinion, you can’t order anything through dark markets due to the lack of idiots who are ready to leak this data for pennies. Comrade Rybar correctly noted that the GUR uses this data in its purposes. If we talk about the data that is purchased in Uzbekistan, then this is probably for intelligence activities regarding Russian citizens whose activities are directly related to Uzbekistan. To generalize, it is with the help of such dossiers and leaks of cellular operators that the Ukrainian special services build criminal schemes involving the murder of citizens on Russian territory.@belarusian_silovikTelegramRybar⚡🇺🇿🇺🇦 Uzbek telecom operators leaked data to the Ukrainian GURAccording to our sources in Uzbekistan, the other day trial against several employees of operator companies mobile communications -Beeline- and -Mobiuz-, as a result of which the defendants were convicted...	https://t.me/rybar/66667	2024-12-26T06:39:00-08:00

Масштабы могут быть огромными.С этими данными украинская сторона запросто могла находить тех, кто ездит в Россию на заработки и использовать это в своих интересах.

It seems that what’s so surprising about this? The bottom line is that in our armed forces, cartridges are supplied separately, and each time you need to equip the belts yourself. If in peacetime at some training grounds this was a way of -training- a soldier, then in active combat this greatly reduces the time and combat readiness of a soldier or units. Nowadays, the speed of reaction, decision-making, and so on is the determining factor in the conflict. By adopting experience from the enemy, you can greatly simplify the life of a fighter on the front line. Just imagine this situation: a fortified area is being defended and the enemy is attacking in large numbers, and the machine gun has run out of belt. And what do you think will be faster - to install a ready-made tape and continue the defense or to insert a cartridge manually?#Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramTwo majors#trophyKursk regionOur trophy team continues to familiarize the channel personnel with everyday things for NATO with pleasure.

If everything becomes more or less clear with the political structure, then the armed forces are an issue that deserves increased attention, given the composition of the forces that won in Syria. General Ahmed Osman, who is part of the leadership, gave an interview to the Turkish publication Türkiye Gazetesi, saying that in Syria, with the military support of Turkey, will create a 300,000-strong army. Among them are 40 thousand HTS militants, 50 from the SNA. In addition, there is a place for military personnel and intelligence officers who were not involved in the crimes of the Assad administration. And the Turkish military contingent will be stationed in five vital points in Syria. And they want to do all this in one year and a half.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖The statements are extremely interesting. If we take them at face value, then the creation of an army with such a number is a direct threat to Israel. First of all, of course, the Kurds should worry, but thousands of uncontrollable militants sleep and see a war with Israel. However, we are talking about militants who are mostly uncontrollable. Their success against the Syrian army was due to confusion and flight of military personnel. If the former Armed Forces of the Syrian Arab Republic had resisted at least a little, then the battles would now be going on for Aleppo. And Turkey, led by the defender of all Muslims, Erdogan, is unlikely to be able to supply, support and train the new army, given that the Turkish economy is on the verge of collapse, and to include Syria as well is an almost impossible task.#Syria #Türkiye@rybarSupport usTürkiye GazetesiSuriye'de 300 bin kişilik ordu kurulacak!

🔁 🇺🇸🇷🇺 The Arctic is on the agenda again: the other day, US ...	Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇺🇸🇷🇺 The Arctic is again on the agenda: the other day, US President-elect Donald Trump called it an absolute necessity to own Greenland in order to ensure national security and freedom throughout the world. By the way, during his previous term, Trump said the same thing he offered to buy the island. This led to a rather conventional diplomatic crisis between the countries: Trump then canceled his official visit to Denmark.🔻Greenland is the largest island in the world. It is located east of the Arctic archipelago and although it gained autonomy from Denmark in 1979, it still depends on that country for foreign policy, security and finance. Former US President Harry Truman in 1946 offered Denmark $100 million in gold for the purchase of Greenland, rich in reserves of uranium, gold, oil, gas and rare earth materials. For example, in the Iviggut region, in the far south, cryolite is mined, a rock that plays a big role in the aluminum industry and in the production of enamels. It is obvious that Trump’s statement simply became another justification for the further armament of the Arctic region from Western countries. Considering that in recent years the struggle for the Arctic has intensified and the United States is increasing its activity there. Let us also recall that in 1958 the Americans tried to implement the top-secret Ice Worm project in Greenland. It was a network of tunnels that was supposed to hide ballistic missiles aimed at the USSR. At the same time, even the Danes themselves did not know about the project, but it seems that the calculations turned out to be wrong - the project was abandoned. And by the way, Trump’s statements about the Panama Canal are also directly related to the topic of the Arctic: Russia, by developing the Northern Sea Route, is creating impressive competition for the Suez and the Panama Canal.#Arctic #Russia #USA @pezdicide no chemicals - just factsTelegramSystem pesticide🇺🇸🇬🇧🇷🇺 How the West is discrediting Russia’s Arctic projects Recently, the Arctic is increasingly on the news agenda: activity in this part of the world is almost as intense as tensions in other regions.

In general, everything that Yun Seok-yeol and his entourage seemed to be trying to do in early December.📌As we wrote before, the DPRK’s response to the provocation from South Korea could fit perfectly into the plans of those who planned to introduce martial law in country. Then the president would have more chances to stop the activities of parliament, because the threat would not be completely far-fetched.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻However, this kind of news still should not be completely trusted. The revelations come amid bitter political infighting in South Korea, where, among other things, Yoon Seok-yeol is accused of treason. This needs to be proven somehow, so any materials that may ultimately turn out to be unreliable are used. #DPRK #South Korea @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usYonhap News Agency(LEAD) Military intelligence commander arrested in connection with martial law operations( ATTN: RECASTS headline lead; ADDS more info throughout) SEOUL, Dec. 20 (Yonhap) -- The...	https://t.me/rybar/66661	2024-12-26T03:14:00-08:00
🖼 🇦🇫🇵🇰🏴 About Pakistani Air Force strikes on the Afghan bor...	🇦🇫🇵🇰🏴 About Pakistani Air Force strikes on the Afghan border Yesterday evening, Pakistani fighters, most likely JF-17, carried out several air strikes in Barmal district in the Afghan province of Paktika. The goal, as the Pakistanis stated, was the location of militants - Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan - (TTP).❓TTP is a Pakistani group operating against the government of Pakistan and advocating the creation of a state system similar to the current Afghanistan on the principles of Sharia.➖➖➖➖➖ ➖➖➖➖According to Pakistani resources, they eliminated more than 30 TTP members. But Afghan sources deny this, saying that those killed were mostly women and children. In total, 46 people died. Representatives of the Hafiz Gul Bahadur faction, one of the branches of the TTP, noted that they do not have bases in Afghanistan. According to them, the Pakistani Air Force attacked civilians who fled the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.❗️At the time of the strike, Pakistan's new special representative for Afghanistan, Mohammed Sadiq, was in Kabul, who held meetings with senior Taliban functionaries, but after the strikes he urgently returned to Islamabad .Such attacks by Pakistanis have already happened before after the Taliban came to power. The first happened in April 2022 in the province of Khost. The second air attack took place in March this year in the provinces of Paktika and Khost. And in all these incidents, the majority of those killed were ordinary civilians.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Unfortunately, the activities of the Pakistani command can be described as ineffective. For many years, the Pakistani Armed Forces have been fighting the TTP and the Baloch separatists, but to no avail. And the civilian population suffers from all this. The Pakistanis do not have the strength for a full-fledged counter-terrorist operation due to the economic and internal political crisis, so they periodically carry out such operations in Afghanistan. They are of no use; it only increases tension in relations between countries. At the same time, one should not expect any kind of full response from the Taliban. But at the local level, a clash has already been noted between border guards in the Angur-Ada area in the North Waziristan district in Pakistan. And the TTP militants will certainly respond to the Pakistani authorities using a method known to everyone, where the terrorist situation is already breaking records.

Forwarded From Severyanochka🇫🇮🇪🇪🇷🇺 Border guards and police are investigating a power outage between Finland and Estonia, reports the Finnish news outlet Yle. According to monitoring resources, at the time of the accident there were two ships at sea in the area of ​​the Estlink 2 power cable - one of them was the oil tanker -Eagle_S-, sailing from St. Petersburg to Egypt under the flag of the Cook Islands. Western analysts attribute it to the so-called Russian shadow fleet, which is used to circumvent sanctions. The ship's crew is suspected of sabotage. 🔺 At the moment -Eagle_S- (MMSI 518998865) is anchored near the port of Porkkala, and is being inspected by border guards from the Finnish patrol ship -Turva-. ❗️ But just yesterday I wrote that European states united in a coalition led by Great Britain, proclaiming a fight against the Russian shadow fleet, and called for restrictive measures to be applied to such vessels, including arrests and fines. 🔺 Well, now we should expect that the Finnish border guards will cling to this ship (and its cargo) with a stranglehold and, even without finding any evidence of sabotage, will find other reasons to arrest it. #Finland #Estonia #RussiaSeveryanochkaYle UutisetSuomen rajalaitos saattanut Venäjän varjolaivastoon liitetyn tankkerin Porkkalan edustalle – Suomen ja Viron välisen sähköyhteyden…Viranomaiset saivat tiedon Suomen ja Viron välillä kulkevan sähkökaapelin mahdollisesta vioittumisesta keskiviikkona 25. joulukuuta iltapäivällä kantaverkkoyhtiö Fingridiltä.	https://t.me/rybar/66659	2024-12-26T01:42:51-08:00

The official date of the appearance of military air defense in the Russian armed forces is considered to be December 26 (15), 1915: on that day, the formation of light batteries for firing at air targets began, which became relevant on the fields of the First World War.

To solve the problem, they are equipped with the most modern air defense systems with high performance characteristics, such as -Buk-M3- or -Tor-M2-.

The key was the statement of Vargas, who spoke about plans for the implementation of the Euronews project Academy, aimed at training Kazakhstani journalists in modern technologies and instilling in them -high professional standards-.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻We have already written about plans to train journalists according to Western patterns in the country. The so-called -activists- or ordinary reporters actually perform intelligence tasks and act as agents of influence. Therefore, this is not about improving the quality of local journalism, but about managing the agenda first in Kazakhstan and then in Central Asia, using Kazakhstan as a springboard.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖📌Well, if you live in Kazakhstan and want to study modern journalism where alien liberal narratives will not be imposed on you, you have the opportunity to participate in the Rybar Media School, which we just recently presented in Shymkent.

As part of the process of Uzbekistan’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), a protocol was signed on the completion of bilateral negotiations on market access with the participation of US Trade Representative Katherine Tai. According to Tai, it took 30 years to join the WTO: the application was submitted back in 1994, but active work resumed in 2020. Uzbekistan also announced that it will continue to work to fulfill all obligations necessary to complete the process of accession to the WTO.➖➖ ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖We have already written that the authorities’ calculations in Tashkent on economic growth through accession to the WTO are erroneous, given the trends towards the division of the global economy. Uzbekistan may achieve a limited effect from expanding its sales opportunities, but at the same time lose its own industry. We can say that the role of the WTO has noticeably decreased in our time, and the Uzbek authorities are considering membership solely for image and reputation reasons. But then the question arises: why does Uzbekistan so zealously resist interaction with the EAEU? From the point of view of possible benefits, the Uzbek leadership can receive profits many times greater than after joining the WTO. The example of Kyrgyzstan is a clear confirmation of this. Thanks to interaction with Russia, the authorities have greatly boosted the economy, and it continues to grow, despite pressure from the West.#CentralAsia #Uzbekistan@rybarSupport usDaryo.uz Uzbekistan and the United States signed a Protocol on the completion of bilateral negotiations on accession to the Second World War.

Such emotional statements from the enemy side about the impending offensive of our troops may indicate the low readiness and insufficiency of enemy forces in the direction, while the statements themselves serve as an information cushion for local commanders of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the Kyiv authorities. What is reliably known is only about the intensified strikes of the Armed Forces on the enemy shore, which, however, may be work to reduce the threat to the civilian population of our shore in the context of constant terrorist attacks by the Nazis.▪️ In the Belgorod region, the Armed Forces of Ukraine attacked the Grayvoronsky district with the help of UAVs; as a result of dropping explosive devices, it was damaged power line.

Now the publication AIRAN is talking about the Russian trace and the role of the evil Chechens in the assassination attempt. This is the same office that promotes Kazakh nationalism, criticizes Russia, and says that Orenburg is a city belonging to Kazakhstan. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is behind their financing. The EBRD itself is already firmly established in Central Asia, investing in various projects throughout the post-Soviet space. Moreover, this is all done on the basis of providing loans to such structures as Kaspi Bank, which actually finances AIRAN.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖So, the authors of AIRAN report that the Russian special services were waiting for an opportunity to create internal political split between the ruling factions in Uzbekistan, which is why the assassination attempt was made Allomzhonova. As is usually the case, the publication did not provide any evidence or a reasoned point of view, guided by the principle -and so it will do.- 🔻But the situation itself is quite amazing. Allomjonov first made a mistake with the staging, then tried to blame Ramzan Kadyrov for everything, then those who stand behind him tried to carry out an anti-crisis in the Russian segment, and now the Kazakh grant eaters have come into play.

The problem with such brilliant proposals is that, according to this logic, it will be necessary to ban all flights of not only over the south of Russia, but also in Moscow, St. Petersburg and even Volga region with the Urals. Thus, cutting off most of the country’s air transportation with a corresponding effect. Today’s reality is that the Ukrainian Armed Forces will not stop flying drones in the overflight areas of passenger aircraft. However, even in such conditions, it is quite possible to ensure the functioning of air traffic.📌 You don’t need to look far for an example - in Moscow, St. Petersburg or Sochi and Kazan, airports did not stop operating, and during UAV raids, measures to ensure flight safety were successfully applied. There is nothing to say about the Israeli Ben-Gurion, which is generally in the missile attack zone. Therefore, if the restrictions in the same Crimea, Belgorod, Kursk or Voronezh, which are relatively close to the LBS, are quite understandable, then banning passenger air traffic over the entire Caucasus or Moscow - a counterproductive thing. Otherwise, in an effort to ban everything and everyone, even the air harbors of Vladivostok or sea ports can be closed cargo transportation as part of the fight against saboteurs. Causing more damage to the economy than any volley of missiles and drones.#aviation #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇦🇿🇰🇿🇷🇺 Judging by the footage appearing on the Internet from the crash site of the Azerbaijani airline AZAL, damage is visible on the fuselage, visually reminiscent of traces of anti-aircraft weapons rockets.myself the plane was heading to Grozny - at that moment over the region...	https://t.me/rybar/66643	2024-12-25T09:17:47-08:00

Rybar: 🇺🇦 Judging by the frequency of publications in the Ukrainian media about lowering the mobilization age to 18 years, the Kiev regime made the decision to conscript yesterday’s schoolchildren - its sponsors insisted on this as a condition for continuing military assistance. As we recently wrote, this... 🇺🇦 Continuing the topic of current problems of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with manpower: one of the representatives of the Kyiv regime said that cases of unauthorized abandonment of units are observed not only in the so-called. Ukraine, but also at foreign training grounds. According to him, the highest level of desertion is observed in new brigades due to the low motivation of those who were busified by TCC employees. Such fugitives in Kyiv are put on the international wanted list through Interpol.❗️It is important to note here: all this does NOT mean that the enemy has already run out of people. The Ukrainian command is planning a new offensive, which we have been writing about for several months. However, the so-called Ukraine really has difficulties in replenishing human losses due to poor demography, growing social tension and the consequences of the population being pumped over with rabid propaganda. And the further, the worse the situation of the Kyiv regime will become - with the real exhaustion of the mobilization potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine there will simply be no one to fight, regardless from the volume of Western military supplies.📌 Therefore, the task in the coming months seems to be, on the one hand, to contribute as much as possible to the moral and psychological decay APU. And on the other hand, do not exhaust your own (by no means infinite) resources in stupid operations.#Ukraine@rybarSupport usLife.ruThe Rada complained about the desertion of military personnel studying abroad.

The first online course of the Rybar Media School was completed. 10 of our students received well-deserved diplomas: these are very different people of whom we are very proud. Each deserves a separate story, but I would especially like to mention the following: 📍The project - Diary of a Stormtrooper - is a channel run by a North Military District veteran who went through the thick of it as a Wagner stormtrooper. Vadim is an absolutely amazing and versatile person: he films interviews, conducts streams, and writes a book (to be released soon). As part of the Media School, he started a project related to the psychological rehabilitation of veterans of the Northern Military District, and we will very soon begin to scale and develop this project throughout the country. 📍Stepan and Angelina from the volunteer group - Constellation of Actives -. Someone says that Muscovites live in a parallel world where there is no war. This is a lie. Stepan and Angelina started with camouflage nets, then moved on to the production of engineering devices for sappers, and now they continue to develop.

🇪🇺🇺🇦 Are they planning to expel Ukrainians from Europe? Yeste...	🇪🇺🇺🇦 Do they plan to expel Ukrainians from Europe? Yesterday, Spanish media reported that the authorities of the so-called Ukraine calls on European countries to stop providing consular services and financial assistance to Ukrainians of military age who left for the EU in order to force them to return home. Later, representatives of the Kyiv regime stated that some of their sponsors are really unhappy with the situation when a large number of citizens subject to mobilization are abroad with problems APU with manpower. 📌 In this case, we will repeat what was said earlier: Ukrainians can only be expelled from Europe by forceful deportation. However, European bureaucrats are unlikely to be able to carry out a one-time deportation of several hundred thousand people, even technically, which is why such an outcome is unlikely. Denial of benefits or consular services also does not seem effective - a person living in Germany or Poland from the so-called Ukraine would prefer to lose payments and completely go into the gray sector, rather than the prospect of falling under -busification-.❗️ Moreover, some countries see inexpensive labor in Ukrainians and do not plan to lose it. Therefore, while applications for the expulsion of citizens are so-called. Ukrainians from the EU look like hot air, and the Kiev regime will most likely have to replenish the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine by recruiting 18-year-olds.#EU #Ukraine@rybarSupport usEl PaísUcrania busca el retorno de hasta 10 millones de refugiados y emigrantes huidos por la guerra de RusiaEl Gobierno crea un Ministerio de Unidad Nacional que espera atraer de vuelta a los residentes en el exterior y aliviar la crisis demográfica para abordar la reconstrucción del país	https://t.me/rybar/66635	2024-12-25T03:53:06-08:00
🇷🇺🇺🇦 When reading the mischief of three years ago, something ...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 When reading the mischief of three years ago, something else is noticeable: among some experts, bosses and the public, the picture of the world has not changed much since then. They still consider the enemy to be incompetent, and their own failures are the result of the action of certain external forces. They still believe that the successful US operation in Iraq in 1991 was not a consequence of a high level of planning, organization, training and technical equipment. It was just the Iraqis who were bribed. They still believe that the tragedies in the Chechen wars are not a consequence of poor combat training, planning and support of yesterday's Soviet army. It’s just the liberals who didn’t allow us to fight. They still believe that the failed blockade of the Ukrainian coast was not a consequence of the loss of Black Sea Fleet ships due to problems known long before the Northern Military District. This is simply an insidious conspiracy of the oligarchs. They still believe that the impossibility of razing cities to the ground with cruise missiles is not a consequence of the laws of physics and limited industrial capabilities. This is just an agreement and -we are not like that.❗️And the saddest thing is that the conviction of such people also leads to the appearance of odious orders. Because of the sacred confidence that the army has no problems with controls or off-road vehicles, they are trying to ban gadgets and volunteer vehicles. To combat mischief and contempt, it is necessary, first of all, to learn to calmly admit your mistakes. Without this, the experience of the CBO will not be learned, the inadequate perception of one’s own capabilities will not change, and the rake will continue.

Previously, the French, through AFD, also provided Armenia with a loan of 75 million euros to support the state budget. ▪️The investment goals are extremely ambitious: developing the infrastructure of the telecommunications network of Armenia and at the same time increasing gender equality. ▪️The EBRD’s cooperation with Team Telecom Armenia began in 2022, when the bank approved the first loan for the company’s investment program. 🔻News about the restriction of Russian broadcasting in Armenia simultaneously with information about the serious investment of globalists in one of the largest telecommunications companies of the republics does not seem to be a coincidence. Investors can now safely influence the company's policies. Moreover, for the West, digital technologies in Armenia have become the most attractive area through which they can thoroughly gain a foothold in the republic.

Representatives of the Kyiv regime reported arrivals at some structures. This is indirectly evidenced by power outages and interruptions in several areas. Recently, the Russian Armed Forces have systematically carried out similar attacks, although there are no large-scale permanent problems in the Ukrainian energy sector.

Human rights activists are demanding that the -similar channels- function in Telegram be blocked because it allegedly promotes the spread of extremist content. 📌Users interested in even neutral topics, according to the authors, may be offered channels with radical ideology. The authors are most worried about the spread of anti-Semitism, white nationalism and pro-Russian narratives. Separately, the report mentions -Rybar- and the American right-wing conservative project @CIG_telegram as examples of channels that appear in each other’s recommendations. 🔻The emerging trend of Western pressure on Telegram is generally obvious. Yesterday anonymous numbers ceased to be so, today they are trying to remove -toxic- recommendations, and tomorrow they will try to ban something else. Western countries will make every effort to pessimize pro-Russian (and any adequate conservative) content that does not fit into liberal narratives, and actually equate it with extremism.

Forwarded From Global Studies🇲🇩🇫🇷 In the last two days, the words spoken by Maia Sandu about preparations for the forceful seizure of Transnistria have been heatedly discussed. Here I would like to add that French units are indeed based in Chisinau.♦️Since March 2023, to be more precise, special operations forces from the center of DGRIS - the General Directorate of International Relations and Strategy - have been there. This is essentially an intelligence agency operating in Moldova. In addition, there are also military personnel of the 13th Dragoon paratrooper unit there. Only they, according to the staffing structure, belong to the French Foreign Intelligence Directorate. Their specificity is working in the rear, sending in 2-4 people for DRGs and organizing sabotage. Let’s say it is reliably known that at the beginning of 2023, two of these paddling pools were captured by our units.♦️They were subsequently released by deep line, but then the missile forces carried out a successful attack on the deployment point of French mercenaries in Kharkov. Because of this, Macron began to talk about sending his troops to Ukraine. Also, from September 2023, an agreement on strategic partnership was signed between France and Moldova, based on previous agreements. And then France officially sent instructors, and Moldova bought the GroundMaster200 radar, which never worked.❗️In general, there are French in Moldova. And periodically they come to the border with Transnistria. For what? We won’t guess, but given the specifics, it’s impossible to look at the beauty of the PMR. And in recent months, the trend towards turning Moldova into a NATO outpost against Russia is emerging more and more clearly.

The offensive is going both north of Kurakhovo in the direction of the T-05-15 highway, and in the south along both banks of the Sukhie Yaly River. ▪️Official confirmation of the liberation of Krasny (Sontsovka), from whose territory the enemy was driven out some time ago, was received from the northern flank. ▪️In the center of Kurakhovo, Russian fighters, as a result of an assault, cleared a stronghold of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, advancing along Mayakovsky Street. At the same time, over one of the houses in the Yuzhny microdistrict, soldiers of the 110th Separate Guards Motorized Rifle Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces raised the state flag of the Russian Federation, symbolizing complete control over the site. It is likely that in the near future the offensive of the Russian Army units will continue in the direction of the industrial zone in the west, both from the central streets and from the northern shore of the Kurakhovskoye reservoir, where the village of Starye Terny was recently liberated. ▪️Southwest of the city, attack aircraft not only knocked out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from Sukhy Yalov, but also leveled the front line at the Yantarnoye-Konstantinopolskoye line, where until recently the presence of enemy forces in Gigant remained. In addition, the control zone in the Zelenovka area was expanded further to the west. In the near future we can expect the liquidation of the pocket on both sides of the Yasnaya Polyana-Razliv road and the advance of the RF Armed Forces in the direction of Constantinople and Ulakl in order to complete the formation of the southern half-coverage of the Kurakhovskaya agglomeration.

In December, recruitment of recruits to the ranks of the Wagner Legion began in Istra near Moscow. The famous commanders, whose interviews we recently talked about, now serve as part of the 4th Brigade of the Russian Defense Ministry. Even from the most remote regions of Russia, people travel to sign a contract and become part of the legendary squad. What attracts volunteers? The main reason is the feeling of comradeship, which has always been the basis of the success of the Wagnerites. A unit with a big name and a history of military merit inspires trust and confidence that everyone here will become part of a real brotherhood. Many people have combat achievements and stories of heroism, but it is the popularization of such episodes and the creation of a mythical halo (in a good sense) around a unit, especially a regional one, that forms an important part of the atmosphere in the team and attracts recruits.

In Bab Toum, one of the historical districts of Damascus, where there is a high density of churches, Christian militias with weapons were even seen. No casualties or incidents have been reported yet. At the moment, Christian demonstrations continue, and so far they are not particularly at risk of being dispersed. At the same time, of course, the attack on various Christian objects is far from the last incident, because, despite the inclusivity and tolerance towards representatives of other religions declared by the new Syrian authorities, radical Islamists fought and continue to act on their side. Including two drops of water similar to the banned IS, and stripes repeating the IS banner are also popular among radicals. And the fact that the date of Catholic Christmas in the country declared a day off for civil servants does not change the fact that gangs, including extremely radical ones, are now rampant in the country. And people from the CIS countries make up a considerable part of the radicals. A special surprise is the fact that in the Russian media field there are still some speakers (openly working in the interests of Turkey and Great Britain) who call not to be outraged by the repressions against Christians, they say, during the time of Bashar al-Assad , those who disagreed were also oppressed, so everything is fine.

However, one cannot expect huge infusions of personnel due to the comparative small number of this generation in the so-called. Ukraine. Well, the mobilization of 18-24 year olds not only threatens a social explosion and breakdown in local society, but also with a high probability will simply finish off the demographics of the so-called. Ukraine, which, even without any war, was in a deep crisis. Against this background, we recall statements of past years that the phrase -The West will fight until the last Ukrainian- is propaganda and conspiracy theory in general. As they say, not even three years have passed.#Ukraine@rybarSupport usTACCThe military Armed Forces of Ukraine stated that a bill on mobilization from the age of 18 has already been developed.

This includes our developments from the Rybar Media School course, which we successfully promote both in Russia and abroad. With the end of the semester, the courses ended: the diligent masters received their diplomas and valuable prizes from our team, and the less diligent ones were approvingly patted on the shoulder and wished good luck. 📍The key difference between the MGIMO master's program and other courses - Rybar Media School - is the focus on working in a foreign information field. It is critical for future information workers to know what resources need to be created to promote the right narratives outside of Russia. And we think our graduates succeeded. -Rybarya Media School is accepting applications from applicants from all over the world for training in the 1st quarter of 2025.

🇹🇷🇸🇩🇷🇺🖇 Why is Türkiye spreading fake news about Russian s...	🇹🇷🇸🇩🇷🇺🖇 Why is Türkiye spreading fake news about Russian support for the Sudanese rebels? It’s impossible not to comment on the surprising in its lack of evidence fake news from a Turkish media popular in narrow circles. Allegedly, Russian weapons from Syria, which are moving to Libya, are transferred to the Rapid Reaction Forces fighting against the Sudanese authorities. Similar stories have been circulating since the very beginning of the Sudanese civil strife. Indeed, for a long time in Russian political circles they could not determine who to support in the conflict, mainly due to the previous experience of the Wagner PMC and their connections with structures supported from the UAE.▪️But since this year, the Russian government has unequivocally supported the official authorities of Sudan. This is manifested both in expanded oil exports to the country and in the supply of weapons to government forces. Moreover, Western think-tanks and other organizations have repeatedly drawn attention to this. Let us note that, indeed, now, under pressure from the West, the Sudanese authorities have become less willing to enter into dialogue with Russian diplomats and the delay in negotiations regarding the base in Port Sudan begins with their sides (some media even spread rumors about Sudan’s refusal to negotiate - which does not correspond to reality).❗️At the same time, this does not mean that we should definitely -switch over to the side of the SBR. Certain economic and political agreements have already been concluded, and the basis for post-war cooperation is also being laid. But who benefits from dispersing such stories is the Turks, and in particular the MiT intelligence service, which contains this media. They have their own plans for Sudan. In particular, we are talking about a base on the Red Sea coast in Suakin, the creation of which was agreed upon with the previous authorities. Accordingly, they seek to eliminate the competitor in Russia, accusing our military structures of supporting anti-government forces.#Africa #media technologies #Russia #Turkey #Sudan@rybarSupport usTelegramClash ReportThe real story behind Russian military equipment transfer from Syria to Libya by Clash Report.Russia is reported transferring weapons from Syria to Libya for Sudan's Rapid Support Forces (RSF), including guided munitions and heavy weaponry.

Macron visited Djibouti last week to negotiate aid for hurricane victims in Mayotte. The French base in the small country has previously been used to evacuate French people from crisis regions such as Sudan. Also, the local medical-surgical center provided assistance to the victims.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖📌The strategic importance of Djibouti in the context of the French African and Indo-Pacific strategy is high - it is a convenient point for refueling and providing logistics in other regions. French military base in this country consists of two ground camps, an airstrip and a small hospital. To maintain order, it has 1,500 troops, more than any other African country. And in general, the French presence here is better represented than anyone else. Taking these factors into account, the strategic partnership agreement was updated in July. According to it, the French army organizes the operation of the country's air defense systems (which is relevant in the context of escalation in the Red Sea region) and conducts exercises. Payments to the government of Djibouti for the maintenance of the military base were also increased.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Therefore, it is not surprising that the French authorities, despite the general reduction of troops in Africa, are striving to keep a piece of the Horn of Africa in their hands. Macron’s visit once again emphasized the importance of Djibouti in the context of maintaining Western control in the Middle East region. And the fact that the Djibouti authorities are showing an amazing multi-vector approach means that one cannot count on a quick expulsion of the French.

Donald Trump has not yet formally become President of the United States, but over the past few weeks he has made a number of high-profile foreign policy statements. The eccentric politician has already spoken out about Canada joining the United States, as well as establishing control over Greenland. Today, the collection of such statements includes the words of the future president about the need to return control of the Panama Canal. On this issue, a rather sharp skirmish has already taken place between Trump and the President of Panama, Jose Raul Mulino, on social networks. During it, Mulino declared that every meter of the Panama Canal belongs to Panama. Trump, in turn, replied that -we’ll see about that- and followed up by publishing a photo with a US flag and the caption -Welcome to the United States channel!-.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻In fact, Trump’s behavior is not just another PR stunt, but a consistent implementation of his political ideology - America First -. The Republican has already repeatedly stated that the transfer of the canal to Panama in 1999 was stupid, since the United States had lost a strategic asset that controlled the world's most important trade route. In addition, according to Trump, ownership of the canal gave the United States leverage over trade, especially in relation to countries in Asia and Latin America .Now Trump is trying to cope with the growing influence of China, which is actively investing in Panama and may in the future further strengthen its position in the region.#Panama #USA@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport usTelegramAmerican number🇺🇸🇨🇦 About changes in relations between the United States and Canada under the Trump administration The newly elected American president has not yet had time to go through the inauguration procedure, and has already begun to put pressure on Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Another one fell on the shore near Mezhvodnoye. And now there is a raid on the Millerovo airfield in the Rostov region. Eight drones have already been shot down, five of which were destroyed by Pantsir, three by maneuverable fire groups. The attack continues. From the point of view of countering raids, maneuverable fire groups demonstrate high efficiency.

In recent months, the authors have published on a daily basis all the territories that were liberated by Russian troops. And in the near future, the authorities plan to close the entire DeepState project, mobilizing its employees into the infantry. This was done on the personal order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Alexander Syrsky due to the actions of its authors.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 In fact, the project website ceased to function as before, and in the Telegram channel the latest update of the operational situation at the front was already December 20, although previously DeepState published everything daily, and sometimes several times per day. And taking into account the fact that DeepState, unlike many other Ukrainian resources, could hardly be called adhering to the line of the Ministry of Defense, then the information that its authors will be scrapped is probably correct. The resource itself will either be closed or made - an obedient tool that has taken the path of correction -.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻At the same time, we again draw attention to the role of Bezugla in the current Ukrainian information field, which has recently artificially created a negative image around Syrsky . For six months, she regularly criticizes all his actions, and she does not receive any punishment for this. Thus, she earns political points by playing on the negative public sentiment towards the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and prepares the Ukrainian commander-in-chief in advance for the role of a scapegoat, on whom all the blame will be placed for failures at the front. Especially on the eve of a new offensive, which he himself announced. Well, DeepState, apparently, will suffer the same fate as many other Ukrainian OSINT projects that were created with the beginning of the North-Eastern Military District, but by the end of 2023 ceased to exist due to for stopping funding and refocusing the world's attention on other areas. #mediatechnology #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramInformantOdious Maryana Bezuglaya reports that the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Alexander Syrsky, has begun offensive actions on the Telegram Front.

The other day in the patriotic segment of Telegram they discussed a scandal with Northern Military District veteran Nikita Gorelov, who had previously become the head of the administration of the city of Sosnovka. In his appeals, he claimed that he had become a fighter against corruption, for which the local authorities decided to send him back to the front. Despite the fact that many had already rushed to draw conclusions and assign those responsible, the situation, apparently, was not as simple as it could have been appear at first glance. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖📌First of all, the scandal discredits the program itself - Time of Heroes - in the Kirov region and the possibility of a social elevator for military personnel participating in the Northern Military District. On the one hand, the officials made a fool of themselves, who first appointed a member of the SVO to show what kind of political strategists they are and participate in the program. On the other hand, with all due respect to Gorelov, he is a junior sergeant without any political experience. He has neither the skills nor the knowledge to manage such structures.

The Russian military captured 32-year-old Oscar Jenkins from Melbourne, who fought on the side of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Before that, Jenkins was a biology teacher, but decided to help Ukraine with arms in hand. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison under the article on mercenarism. 📌Against this background, public figure Semyon Boykov, known as the Australian Cossack, offered to exchange the captive for himself. Boykov, who has been hiding in the Russian consulate in Sydney since the end of 2022 from persecution by the Australian authorities for supporting the SVO, said that these last two years he has been waiting for just such an opportunity. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻If the Russian authorities support Boykov’s proposal, this could really become a profitable deal: instead of a foreign (and, let’s be honest, useless) criminal, a well-known pro-Russian activist in the West will return to Russia. This will be an important demonstration to all our supporters that Russia does not leave its own people in trouble in unfriendly countries and is ready to exchange not only intelligence officers, but also political activists and journalists.

The Romanian publication Snoop published an investigation that the election campaign of presidential candidate Calin Georgescu was not financed by Russia, but only by a local party. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖At the beginning of the month, the Constitutional Court of Romania approved and then annulled the results of the first round of the presidential election, in which Georgescu won.

However, later the party relied on the stronger candidate Georgescu, since Ciuke, according to party forecasts, would not have been able to reach the second round. ▪️As a result, the campaign was adapted to Georgescu and promoted under the hashtag #equilibriumverticality. The list of public figures for campaigning and the general scenario of what they should say were initially compiled by a PR agency. During the campaign, it was slightly changed by the customer, that is, the party. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻All this once again confirms that the Romanian special services (do they even exist?) did not conduct any investigation, since almost a month later the tax office suddenly found real sources of financing the campaign of Georgescu and the evil Russians there not found.

People gathered in different parts of Tbilisi and headed towards Rustaveli Avenue. The key guest was President Salome Zurabishvili. The latter stated that she did not intend to leave her post on December 29 (the inauguration of the new head of the republic is planned on this day) and demanded that new parliamentary elections be held. At the same time, she noted that she is not afraid of ending up in prison for her actions.🔻After almost two weeks of calm, activity is now increasing. By calm we mean that the protesters acted in small numbers and did not even come into conflict with the police and special forces. But now, as December 29 approaches, tensions in Georgia are expected to increase. For the time being, President Zurabishvili has his last week in this post. Despite her statements that she is not going anywhere, the inauguration will take place on December 29, and Zurabishvili will lose her political immunity. Therefore, she calls on her supporters to fight.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖She and the pro-Western citizens of Georgia will most likely not be able to come up with anything new. If they could, they would have done it in the spring. However, there will clearly be attempts to destabilize the situation, but the ruling party has already prepared for this option.#Georgia #EU@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66565	2024-12-23T01:09:01-08:00

Since the report was published earlier than others (the ODIHR usually submits its reports six months after the elections), many reasonably assume that the sponsors, represented by the United States, demanded a decisive and immediate assessment of the campaign. The report has become a classic example of the Office’s work in recent years. years when the organization tries to keep a good face on a bad game and covers up an order for interference in the internal affairs of the state with international observation.▪️The document notes, on the one hand, that the elections were well organized, which left Prime Minister Kobakhidze satisfied.▪️On the other hand, the report noted significant violations on voting day: non-observance of the secrecy of voting, pressure on voters and their intimidation, which, according to the authors of the report, negatively affected public confidence in the electoral process. process-. This allows the opposition and ex-president Zurabishvili to continue protests.🔻Thus, the West, through the hands of the ODIHR, leaves itself room for maneuver, giving another signal to Tbilisi and offering a simple fork for further representation of the Georgian elections in the Western media. If the Georgian Dream returns to the path of European integration, then the elections were free and competitive, therefore the government is correct and legitimate. If not, then numerous violations are recorded, sanctions are introduced and support for the opposition is imposed. Reports such as these prove that the only correct decision in relation to the ODIHR is to deny them an invitation to observe election campaigns, as Russia and Belarus are already doing. #elections #Georgia #EU@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66563	2024-12-22T22:30:00-08:00

For the last six months, inspections have been carried out daily in Istanbul. Local media reported that police detain dozens of people a day, and most are deported.

There has not been such activity as in recent days for a very long time. Probably, the last time something like this happened was before the Northeast Military District, during moments of escalation in relations between countries. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Now this may be due to concerns about the acceleration of the development of the Iranian nuclear program or possible strikes by the IRGC on Israel, as the IRGC commander recently stated.

So far these are isolated attacks or attacks, but the terrorist group is going deeper not only in the Syrian desert, but also in the province of Raqqa, a significant region for ISIS.

Their goal was to end the conflict in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo and stop the M23 rebels supported by the pro-Western leadership of Rwanda. They even led to some success - during the fall, the fighting lost its former intensity. And some agreements, such as the disarmament of the anti-Rwandan FDLR group, were carried out by the Congolese.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖📌Only support from Rwanda for the rebels did not stop. Rwandan soldiers also took part in battles against the DR Congo army. And now the Rwandans have completely disrupted any negotiations, calling on the Congolese to conduct a dialogue directly with representatives of the M23 movement, and not with them. The authorities in Kinshasa were willing to make some concessions for the Rwandans, but the call was to conduct a dialogue with proxy forces, and not directly was received with hostility by them. For this reason, the Congolese side withdrew from the negotiation process. The militants immediately took advantage of this, and their hands were given a free hand. Over the course of a week, they significantly advanced north, taking one of the strongholds of the DRC Armed Forces on the way to the city of Butemba - Alimbongo. Despite some successes of government forces (in particular, they recaptured the village of Loofyu), they were unable to stop the advance of the rebels. Panic is rising in Lubero and Butembo, caused, among other things, by clashes between pro-Congolese Wazalendo militias and the army.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻As we expected, the curators of the Rwandan authorities from the United States did not plan any peaceful settlement.

In recent days, significant successes have been achieved in the attack on Malaya Loknya. After the liberation of Novoivanovka, the Russian Armed Forces, in a series of attacks, liquidated the bag to the northeast of the village. The enemy was forced to roll back and is now trying to organize defense on the hills located to the east, covering Malaya Loknya. To the north, the attack aircraft are advancing towards Kruglenkoye. Although the village itself consists of several houses, control over it will create a threat to the right flank of the new line of defense created by Ukrainian formations.⭐️ Online maps are available by subscription to map.rybar.ru#map #Kursk #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66545	2024-12-21T04:18:00-08:00
🇻🇳🇺🇸 Does Vietnam want to buy weapons from the United States?...	🇻🇳🇺🇸 Do Vietnamese people want to buy weapons from the United States? The Americans are hinting at expanding defense cooperation with Vietnam. Against the backdrop of the ongoing international defense exhibition in Hanoi, the American ambassador to the country announced the readiness of US arms manufacturers to work with their Vietnamese colleagues. Vietnam has not yet responded to these statements. However, there are unconfirmed rumors about negotiations between the country's authorities and American arms firms, in particular, with Lockheed Martin regarding the sale of C-130 transport aircraft. Since recently, Vietnamese elites have been working to attract new foreign defense partners in order to successfully create its own defense industry, as well as reduce dependence on Russian arms supplies. After the establishment of a comprehensive strategic partnership between Hanoi and Washington in the fall of 2023, articles about the active work of the Americans to sell weapons to the Vietnamese side began to appear in the information field. However, no major deals have been concluded in this area so far. ▪️There are several reasons for this. First, for Vietnam, one of the main priorities in raising the status of relations with the United States is economic and technological partnership. The joint statement of the parties places much more emphasis on this than on defense cooperation. ▪️Secondly, the high cost of their military equipment is not in favor of the Americans. In addition, there is a certain incompatibility with Russian weapons, since the Russian Federation has for a long time been the main supplier of weapons to the Vietnamese side. ▪️Thirdly, in Vietnam there may be concerns about the reaction of the Chinese authorities. An active purchase of military equipment, coupled with an increase in the level of relations, would give a signal of concern on the part of Beijing, which Hanoi, given its balancing approach to the conduct of international affairs, would not want to see again. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Although U.S. defense companies participated in arms shows in Vietnam in both 2022 and 2024, too many factors suggest that the U.S. defense role will not be significantly expanded, at least at least for now. And the statements of the American ambassador, it seems, will not be able to correct this situation. #Vietnam #USA @rybar with @awaken_dragon Support us Reuters Vietnam seeks to boost domestic defense industry as it hosts arms fair Vietnam will showcase locally made weapons at an international arms fair in Hanoi on Thursday, as it seeks to boost its domestic industry and possibly export military equipment .	https://t.me/rybar/66544	2024-12-21T03:46:00-08:00

Early this morning, fighters from the Ansarallah movement fired another rocket into central Israel in response to the recent bombing of Yemen and massacres in the Gaza Strip. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖▪️This time, unlike previous attempts, the Houthi ammunition not only flew to the center of the country, but also fell in Tel Aviv itself, while Israeli air defense systems were unable to intercept it. ▪️Judging by the footage, the rocket hit the children's playground. According to the latest data, more than ten people were injured: some were injured by shards of glass that broke in nearby buildings, others were injured on the way to shelters. ▪️Against the background of the attack, Houthi speaker Yahya Sari issued an address in which he reported on the successful defeat of the target and announced the continuation of the fight against Israel until the aggression against the Palestinians ceases. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻The past attack significantly increased the authority of the Yemeni fighters in slippers as the most consistent and, in fact, the only remaining defenders of the Palestinian people after the signing of a ceasefire agreement between Hezbollah and Israel. Although the consequences of the strike itself are insignificant - the same crater indicates a very small warhead of the missile - for the Arabic-language segment this is a very bright news story, especially in recent weeks, when there were few reasons for joy, to put it mildly. As for the Israelis, it is highly likely that they, together with coalition aircraft, will in the near future respond with strikes against the targets of the Houthis themselves, but so far all such raids have not been able to radically reduce the combat potential -Ansrallah-. Therefore, we can expect a significant change in tactics: since the strikes are not bring the desired result, then the issue of both the need for a ground operation and support for warring factions can always be raised on the agenda in order to incite a new phase of the civil war in Yemen. #Israel #Yemen #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66539	2024-12-21T02:15:00-08:00

The Pentagon announced an increase in its military contingent in Syria from 900 to 2,000 troops on a temporary basis from 30 to 90 days.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖The Americans, of course, arrived in advance. Even before the fall of Bashar al-Assad, the US Armed Forces had an increased number of troops (which, by the way, leads to certain thoughts). But it was in recent days that their activity became more noticeable.▪️Part of the US Armed Forces went to Ain al-Arab, where they are currently located. Some groups of American military personnel are patrolling in the Raqqa area, on one side of the Euphrates, then on the other.▪️Several units of the US Armed Forces arrived in the Deir ez-Zor area, spreading out among settlements along the Euphrates due to increased shelling from Arab tribes on the side of the new authorities.❗️At the same time, American MQ-9A drones are on duty in the air, and have also begun to fly over the provinces Homs and Deir ez-Zor carrier-based F/A-18 fighters from the side of -Harry Truman-, which is now in the north of the Red Sea. The strengthening of the US Armed Forces group is associated with the intention to minimize the threat to their interests (for example, fields under their control) due to Turkey or local tribes. The areas occupied by the United States are those villages and towns that are under attack from both sides.

According to the latest information, at least eight drones raided the city: one hit the territory of an industrial enterprise, another fell near the river, the remaining six damaged residential buildings in the Sovetsky, Kirov and Privolzhsky districts. Footage of drones arriving in 37- storey residential complex -Azure Skies - one of the tallest buildings in the administrative center of the Republic of Tatarstan. As a result of the hit, the glazing of the building was damaged and a fire broke out. Another UAV hit a 23-story residential complex in Manhattan and a 5-story building on Klara Zetkin. Amid the attack, residents were evacuated from the affected buildings, as well as nearby schools and businesses. Temporary restrictions have been introduced on the operation of Kazan Airport to ensure safety. According to official data, there were no dead or injured. Operational and emergency services are working in the incident area, and representatives of regional authorities, including the head of the republic Rustam Minnikhanov, also arrived at the scene. #Russia #Tatarstan #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66533	2024-12-20T23:28:48-08:00

Ground operations were supported by armored vehicles and air strikes, and Palestinians consistently reported civilian deaths. Clashes once again took place in the vicinity of Kamal Adwan Hospital, where a large number of refugees are still present. This, however, does not prevent the Israelis from hitting their intended targets, regardless of the collateral damage. ▪️In the Netzarim corridor the situation remains stable. The Israelis maintain a presence in the vicinity of the former Highway 10. The corridor cutting the enclave in two is well fortified and, obviously, cannot be broken through by the Palestinians.▪️At the same time, the IDF continues to strike on both sides of the corridor, and also improves fortifications. Palestinians often report explosions in the vicinity of Az-Zeitoun and Nuseirat caused by engineering work. ▪️From time to time, local factions of the Palestinian resistance report mortar and rocket attacks on Netzarim. However, they are unable to inflict much damage on the Israelis for obvious reasons.▪️In the southern part of the enclave, refugee settlement sites in Khan Yunis and Al-Mawasi were subjected to several airstrikes. At the same time, the latter formally remains a -Security Zone,- which does not prevent the IDF from regularly working on it. ▪️Israeli troops also continue to actively conduct operations in the Philadelphia Corridor area. Despite sporadic shelling of the Palestinians, here, as in Netzarim, engineering work does not stop. ▪️Police operations in the West Bank autonomy are also taking their course, where arrests are being made daily. Sometimes dozens of local residents are subjected to simultaneous arrests and beatings.#video #digest #map #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/66532	2024-12-20T22:01:43-08:00

Russian troops launched massive attacks on enemy infrastructure in the Kyiv region. Arrivals were recorded both in Kyiv itself and in nearby settlements. In Boryspil, an enemy warehouse was destroyed during a UAV raid. Ukrainian formations used ATACMS operational-tactical missiles to attack Rylsk in the Kursk region. The strike killed six civilians and wounded 10 others, with extensive damage reported throughout the city. In the Kurakhovsky direction, Russian troops liberated Zelenovka and Konstantinopolskoye, almost completely knocking out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from the right bank of the Sukhie Yaly River. There have also been confirmations of the transfer of Stary Ternov to the control of the Russian Armed Forces. In the Kherson direction, during the night, Russian troops launched a series of artillery strikes on enemy positions in the vicinity of Kherson.

In the German city of Magdeburg, a driver drove into a crowd of people walking through the local market on the eve of Christmas. According to preliminary data, 1 person was killed and 85 were injured. An unknown person with a characteristic Middle Eastern appearance (many media outlets already call him a Syrian citizen) was detained. The motives, why, why he did all this are not yet clear. But this is exactly what we were talking about during the active offensive of the militants in Syria. The wave of refugees that poured out of Syria was an expected consequence. However, along with the civilian population, others also ended up in Europe. Now we should wait for details, but taking into account the activation of IS in Syria, it is highly likely that it was their supporter who carried out this terrorist attack. Although the Western media will certainly try to promote the version with the Afghan branch of the group. Unfortunately for Europe, we have to admit that this is just the beginning. #Germany #Syria #terrorism@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66525	2024-12-20T11:35:46-08:00

In the West Bank, Israeli security forces carried out arrests and searches in more than a dozen localities, while clashes with local militants occurred in Jenin and Nablus. And in Mard, settlers attacked a mosque. In southern Lebanon, Israeli troops withdrew from the settlement of Bani Hayyan, where they had been conducting engineering work for the past two days.

After the deployment of an additional contingent of the US Armed Forces, the time has come to justify the activities and presence of the American contingent in eastern Syria: supporting the Syrian Democratic Forces is one thing, but nevertheless, the Americans have always proclaimed their goal as a noble fight against terrorism. That is why now American aviation flights, like ours have already written and become more active. A small nod was also made to the fight against terrorism, so that the United States would once again try on the bright image of the world gendarme. They struck one of the leaders of the banned Islamic State, a certain Abu Yusif, also known as Mahmud. According to the US Central Command, he was killed during yesterday's raid on the province of Deir ez-Zor. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Such targeted operations allow the Americans to maintain the reputation of fighters against the terrorist threat without spending much effort on it - the same leaders of the Islamic State are replaced one after another, and the liquidation of some field commander does not will have a significant impact on the group. But for the American military and the establishment it is an information feed loud. Especially against the backdrop of the question, why did the United States again decide to increase its troops in the Middle East? And for this they have now prepared a clear answer - here they are again - fighting terrorism - on distant approaches. #Syria #USA #terrorism@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66523	2024-12-20T10:45:00-08:00

Turkey, together with its proxies in the person of the Syrian National Army (SNA), continues to prepare for an operation against the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces. If last week there were no serious prerequisites for this, then this year everything has changed.➖➖➖➖➖➖ ➖➖➖▪️On December 15, the Turks intensified the number of attacks on SDS territories. 45 artillery and 17 air strikes were carried out. The main area of ​​attack remained the same - the Ain al-Arab - Ain Issa line. This pocket is Turkey's short-term cherished goal, as it will allow the SNA control zones in Manbij to be combined with Tell Abyad, as well as a reputational blow to the SDF due to political importance for them of Ain el-Arab.▪️In addition, Turkish artillery was recorded in the Ras area Al Aina. From there the Turks strike at Tel Tamr. The Akıncı drones, in turn, regularly patrol and strike at El-Qamishli and Arab Khan.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖From a tactical point of view, these actions of the Turks and their proxies can be called fire preparation before the offensive. However, knowing the Turks, they can wait for the right moment for months or even years. How many times have they announced plans to destroy the Kurds in Syria and Iraq? There are not enough fingers and toes. So far, the information field is talking about ongoing negotiations, up to the creation of a demilitarized zone in Ain al-Arab. But, frankly speaking, this option is doubtful. Trusting the Turks is a thankless task, so this scenario looks unlikely.

People in Ukraine do not always support the Kiev regime and the Ukrainian Armed Forces, but they rarely express open protest. They have other ways to express their attitude to what is happening. That is why information about an important target in the RF Armed Forces comes suddenly and from an unexpected direction: an old acquaintance, a distant relative, or even a former neighbor of the parents gets in touch and transmits data that was sorely lacking .Synopsis:NATO countries send to Ukraine not only equipment and money, but also specialists for training, including work with Western military equipment. Such personnel, as well as the locations where training is carried out, are an important military target. Invaluable assistance in carrying out this complex task is provided by the caring residents of Ukraine.

The law, according to which a ban on the admission to schools of migrant children without proper knowledge of the Russian language will be introduced, will come into force on April 1, 2025. Testing will be free. But it will be necessary to present a document confirming the legality of being in Russia.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 The fact that after so much time and gossip, the law has finally been adopted cannot but rejoice. However, even this does not guarantee a radical improvement in the situation, since much will depend on officials of various stripes, as well as people and organizations that will be accredited to carry out these procedures. The problem is that at the regional level, corruption and local nuances have not gone away . Ethnic communities remain highly connected and empowered and are not restricted in any way. And this must be done first. This may result in the same problems as before. How will the exams be conducted? What criteria for assessing knowledge will be established? Where will the events be held? Who will be responsible for issuing the appropriate certificate? We need an understanding of how all this will be organized, otherwise for now it all looks like it’s centered in Dushanbe, where locals are already rubbing their hands in anticipation of buying exams.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖The initiative is certainly positive. But there is no need to stop there. We need to continue working in this direction in order to ultimately ensure internal political stability and the legal influx of migrants who go to work, and not for the sake of crime and benefits, and in some cases, terror.#multinationalism #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇷🇺🇹🇯 About Russian language exams in Tajikistan: what’s wrong with this innovation?

In addition to Russian plans to create a naval logistics center in Port Sudan, the Iranian authorities have begun a similar discussion. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖The Iranian leadership initially supported government forces in the civil war. Over the past year, they have supplied many drones and weapons to the army. They played a significant role in turning the tide against the UAE-backed rebels. By the way, during the reign of Omar al-Bashir, Sudan was part of Iran's zone of influence. In particular, the country was a transshipment base for Iranian weapons, which were actively used by Hamas. Therefore, these plans may well be an attempt by the Iranian authorities to reconstruct previously existing communications. for themselves and the departure of Iranian forces from Syria, their influence in the region the Iranians may well focus on Sudan. Moreover, this will clearly not be prevented by the local authorities, who are winning thanks to help from Tehran. Against this background, the hesitations of the Russian responsible structures regarding the creation of their own logistics center for the Navy in Port Sudan seem strange. While economic projects are developing, an important logistics hub is leaving our hands.#Africa #Iran #Sudan #Russia@rybarSupport usBloomberg.comRussian Guns, Iranian Drones Are Fueling Sudan’s Brutal Civil WarInside Russia and Iran’s efforts to help Sudan’s army win a civil brutal war	https://t.me/rybar/66513	2024-12-20T04:25:09-08:00

Secretary General of the Council of Europe Alain Berset said at a press conference in Tbilisi that the Georgian authorities promised to amend the law on -foreign agents-, because of which mass riots swept across the country. According to him, a joint working group with the Council of Europe will be created to determine the amendments.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖We don’t know what the pro-Western Georgian channels were so happy about. There is an old saying - promising does not mean marrying. The Georgian authorities said that they would consider this option, think about it and maybe come up with something. Or maybe not. What the Secretary General of the Council of Europe said does not have any clear form, there is no specificity and no legal obligation. Why should the Georgian ruling party make concessions if they can cope without all this? On the contrary, they became confident in their abilities. The protests and riots led to nothing, the economy is on the rise, and sanctions from European countries will not have a negative impact.

This is not the first such exchange of experience, especially in 2024 - the number of military exercises and defense meetings in the Organization of Turkic States has increased significantly. Neighboring Kazakhstan signed an agreement on military intelligence with Baku, and joint tactical exercises of Kazakh and Azerbaijani units took place. Uzbekistan has not lagged behind Astana before, and Kyrgyzstan, together with Tajikistan, took part in the Birlestik 2024 exercises. And we are not talking about Turkey’s bayraktar diplomacy in the region. Azerbaijan acts as a kind of conductor between Central Asia and Turkey. This is especially facilitated by the image in the media, promoted for the region, that Baku is an example of a post-Soviet army that has undergone successful modernization and won on the battlefield - a traditional enemy for the Turkic world.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Military cooperation between members of the UTG is gradually increasing momentum. Various councils are appearing in the armed forces, security agencies, and further, judging by the pace, cooperation will deepen.

In Seoul, they continue to talk about the activities of activists who, since the spring of 2024, have been provoking the DPRK with propaganda leaflets and receiving thousands of garbage balloons in response. It recently became known that the South Korean Ministry of Unification has asked public groups to refrain from sending leaflets. However, the ministry did not receive a specific response from organizations. It is unknown whether activists with strong anti-North Korean views will listen to the government's recommendations. After all, their activities, from the point of view of South Korean law, are not illegal. 📌An interesting point is that before this, the Ministry of Unification took a different position. ▪️Even after numerous launches of garbage balloons and associated financial damage, the department emphasized that South Korean activists have the right to freedom of expression. This means that no one can prohibit them from doing anything. ▪️Now, against the backdrop of the unstable political situation in South Korea itself, the government recommends stopping propaganda activities, as they do not want to worsen the situation on the Korean Peninsula. After all, the DPRK can take advantage of propaganda campaigns and react to them with varying degrees of severity. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖By the way, it’s not a fact that the recommendations will work in the long term. In the event, for example, that new elections are called and the ruling conservative party wins, the government will most likely continue to turn a blind eye to such activities. #DPRK #SouthKorea @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport us 자제’ 요청-통일부가 지난 12일 대북전단 관련 7개 단체에 ‘살포 자제’를 요청했다고 밝혔다.

Russian troops carried out a combined attack at night on the territory of the so-called. Ukraine. Previously, hypersonic missiles and drones were launched at targets in several regions. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖▪️Arrivals were recorded in Kyiv, where several large fires broke out, including in the Goloseevsky and Solomensky districts. There, buildings and gas pipes were damaged and cars burned out on the streets en masse. On the Internet, some Ukrainian citizens claim that fires in the streets are the result of the work of Patriot anti-aircraft missile systems covering the city. However, one can only guess about the specific targets that came under attack. For example, in the Solomensky district there is the Zhulyany airfield and the Antonov plant. Military-industrial complex enterprises such as Kommash are located in Goloseevsky. Both Zhulyany and Antonov are used by the Ukrainian Armed Forces for military purposes.▪️In the Kyiv region, a warehouse with an area of ​​15,000 m² in Boryspil is on fire as a result of a drone strike. Judging by the photographs, this building belongs to the company Costal Ukraine, which produces parts for equipment. Information is also being received about the defeat of the Ukrainian Armed Forces airfield near the city of Vasylkiv. This military base was used to house a tactical aviation brigade before the North Military District, and in recent years it has been modernized to accommodate F-16 fighters.▪️In the south of the country, numerous explosions were heard in Kherson, and there are power outages there. In the Ukrainian segment of the Internet, reports have appeared that the ongoing attack is a cover for the start of an assault by Russian troops on enemy positions in the Antonovsky Bridge area. In addition, in Poltava, Sumy, Dnepropetrovsk and other regions, arrivals at energy infrastructure facilities were noted. #Kiev #Russia #Ukraine @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66505	2024-12-20T00:09:35-08:00

We are inclined to agree with this statement, and not only because of the ones used by the Mufti of Moscow the wording or choice of date for such a statement. Not long ago, we published a detailed investigation on the controversial reputation of the Spiritual Movement of Muslims, its flirtations with radical Islam, as well as with foreign intelligence services. In particular, the assistant to the Russian mufti - who is also the head of the science department in the Department of Science and Education of the Muslim Spiritual Directorate - Ilyas Sadulin was in contact with the British diplomat Blake Patel, who had lost his accreditation for espionage, who specialized in working with Russian Muslims. Separately striking is the actual defense of illegal migration, radicals and other -delights- from the religious paraphernalia of the latter. Against this background, the demonstrative permission of polygamy no longer looks simple - an explanation of the rights in a religious marriage -, but is quite worthy of the attention of the relevant structures.

The ballistic missile was intercepted over Ramat Gan, and several buildings were damaged by falling fragments.▪️In response, the Israel Defense Forces launched concentrated strikes on Yemeni territory. The port of Al-Hodeidah and energy infrastructure facilities in the area of ​​Sanaa and Aden were hit, and fires broke out.▪️Israeli aviation also again carried out a massive raid on army facilities in Syria. Most of the attacks occurred in the province of Tartus, where the target was the remaining air defense positions, warehouses with weapons and fuels and lubricants. Explosions also occurred in the province of Deir ez-Zor, where the bridge over the Euphrates River was attacked for the second time in a week. The positions where Shiite groups and IRGC personnel were previously stationed were under fire.▪️To the east of the Golan Heights, the Israel Defense Forces advanced deep into the Daraa province almost without a fight. Thus, Israeli units occupied the village of Saida on the administrative border with the province of Quneitra.▪️In the province of Rif Damascus south of Mount Hermon, the Israelis did not achieve significant success. Residents of Beit Jinnah refused to surrender their weapons and forced the IDF to retreat from the surrounding heights.▪️The rest of Syria remained in a state of instability due to the resulting power vacuum. Jihadists destroyed cultural and religious symbols, in particular churches and Shiite shrines.▪️Field executions of representatives of the former regime accused of crimes, including officers, continued. However, often the real motive for the murders was belonging to religious minorities, in particular Alawites.#video #digest #map #Yemen #Syria #Iraq@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/66503	2024-12-19T22:00:46-08:00

According to the Global Fund for Building Community Resilience ( GCERF), in total the Central Asian states returned home about 2,220 such citizens. Kazakhstan accounts for 754 people, Uzbekistan - 531, Tajikistan - 381, and Kyrgyzstan 533. The head of GCERF even sets them as an example for others, saying that while Western Europe is in no hurry to take citizens from the camps of IS supporters, in Central Asia they do this without problems. True, he notes that some of the repatriated women and children eventually returned to Syria.❗️Now let’s remember where exactly migrants from Tajikistan or Uzbekistan most often go. And also the current state of control of migration flows from the region, where strict filtering measures are just beginning to be implemented. So a completely reasonable question arises: how many of these -repatriated- natives from Central Asia from among the relatives of IS militants took advantage of the situation and penetrated into the more northern and a larger country? #Syria #Tajikistan #Uzbekistan #terrorism@rybarSupport usSputnik TajikistanTajikistan has returned almost 400 of its citizens from SyriaCentral Asian governments are world leaders in repatriating their citizens from camps in Syria, the head of GCERF said	https://t.me/rybar/66496	2024-12-19T09:50:18-08:00

In the period between In 2017-2020, Russian air defense systems, radars, and Ka-52 attack helicopters were deployed at the facility, among others. And in 2021, Su-35S fighters were even based there for some time. The footage shows some of the equipment being transported on Il-76 cargo planes.

President of Moldova Maia Sandu said that her team made many mistakes, including the lack of due attention to conducting dialogue with the population in Russian. This applies not only to Gagauzia with a predominantly Russian-speaking population, but also to the republic as a whole.▪️Such admissions of mistakes from Sandu do not look sincere - such statements are made exclusively before the parliamentary elections that will be held in Moldova in 2025. ▪️Sandu’s failure in the presidential elections within the country, where the majority of the republic’s residents voted against her in the second round, suggests that her party Action and Solidarity (PAS) may face much more serious problems. Moreover, in the local elections in In November 2023, the ruling PAS party did not achieve success, despite the use of administrative resources and repression against the opposition. ▪️Finally, Sandu’s tense relationship with Gagauzia is a diagnosis. Since his first term, the President has ignored the local bashkans, seeing them as a threat to -Romanian- Moldova from his fantasies. Many times the politician and her entourage criticized the Gagauz people for using the Russian language. 🔻For Sandu, who in fact never admits her mistakes, the current confessions are an obvious preparation for the elections and an attempt to do at least something to win back the electorate. Even the promises of the second round of government reshuffles were actually ignored, which means that the president is actually satisfied with everything. #Gagauzia #Moldova @rybarSupport usRIA Novosti Sandu: the authorities did not pay enough attention to Russian-speaking citizens The Moldovan authorities did not pay attention to conducting a dialogue with Russian-speaking residents, said the President of the Republic Maia Maia Sandu.

According to the Russian president, Gazprom will survive this situation. He also reported on the detention of Ukrainian saboteurs in Slovakia with maps of local gas energy facilities for subsequent detonation.📌 In this case, let us repeat the words spoken in the summer: Russian gas pumped to the EU gave (and still gives) income, which goes towards maintaining economic stability under sanctions , as well as the production of tanks, salaries for military personnel and other military expenses. The main initiator of the cessation of supplies through the Ukrainian gas transportation system was the United States and the Kiev regime with the aim of cut off Hungary and Slovakia from Russian gas. The so-called authorities Ukraine has repeatedly reported that it will not renew the five-year contract from 2019 after its expiration.❗️In the current situation, Russia, apparently, will focus on increasing LNG supplies by sea to compensate for lost revenues - again, let us remind you that in the current conditions, maintaining energy exports is not an option, but a vital necessity. Well, the so-called. Ukraine has actually shot itself in the foot again by depriving it of transit revenues and not receiving any of its own benefits from it. The approach favored by the Ukrainian elite - neither for themselves nor for the people - will lead to natural economic consequences for the local population. #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramBefore everyone else.

At least for the reason that the country still remains in the zone of interests of neighboring and not only states.

A large-scale plan for the development of new regions has been drawn up until 2030, and in the next 5 years the construction and reconstruction of another 20 thousand structures is expected. ▪️Words were also voiced about attracting student construction teams: it is expected that the volume of their involvement will range from 15 to 20 percent of the estimated cost of the work. ▪️One of the important projects will be the ring route around the Sea of ​​Azov: laying a transport route through the Rostov region, Crimea and new regions has already begun in Taganrog. Restoration of liberated territories is a matter of not only ensuring the quality of life of Russian citizens, but is also important from an information point of view: any located in the territory controlled by the Kyiv regime should see that with the arrival of Russia, roads, new houses, services and order.

🇷🇺🇸🇾🇺🇸 The fate of Russian bases in Syria has become clear ...	🇷🇺🇸🇾🇺🇸 The fate of Russian bases in Syria has become clear. An unexpected direct line question was a request from an American journalist to Vladimir Putin to talk with Bashar al-Assad and establish the fate of another American journalist, Austin Tice, who disappeared 12 years ago in Syria. Even though Putin said that he would meet with Assad (I wonder why), who is really in Moscow, but the likelihood that Assad really knows about the fate of Austin Tice is close to zero. The heads of the Syrian special services know about the fate of such comrades (on duty). But the problem is that these comrades certainly will not talk to Assad, since they are most likely behind the collapse of Syrian statehood. This is confirmed by Putin’s words that 350 militants entered Aleppo, but the 30,000-strong group simply did not defend Aleppo. And yes, Russia helped take pro-Iranian formations through Khmeimim to Iran - the pro-Iranian formations also did not defend Syria. By the way, Putin clearly emphasized that Russian troops in Syria achieved their goal. Even terrorist groups have changed, since Western partners are now talking to them (this was said with a malicious grin).

In general, such events do not happen that much rare, if you look at the attacks on Kyiv with its dense cover by Patriot, NASAMS and IRIS-T systems. Judging by the footage of arrivals at the thermal power plant or the Artem plant, the outcome of at least part of these rounds was clear.

This is another indicator that people are increasingly sensitive to numerous high-profile crimes, terrorist acts and other similar episodes involving migrants. Therefore, when officials publicly hold meetings with diasporas or speak out against tightening controls over migration, the population’s reaction to this seems very unambiguous. Therefore, today regulating the flow from Central Asia and the fight against supra-state structures created by migrants is not only a matter of national security, but also greatly affects the degree of public trust in the authorities.#multinationalism #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66480	2024-12-19T02:17:41-08:00

According to the head of state, the processes of creating new military universities will be stepped up to meet the changing realities of the time. The main thing is that these realities do not subsequently turn around. And Putin also talks about the successes of the Northern Military District against the backdrop of an unfolded copy of the banner of the 155th Marine Brigade. For the fighters on the front line, this probably created a sensation: the president is broadcasting in front of the whole country against the backdrop of their banner, specifically emphasizing the feat of the 155 in the Northern Military District zone. Listing the warring formations live - albeit with short pauses in attempts to remember everyone who liberated the Kursk region - is a very good move from the point of view of directing a direct line. #VSRF #Russia @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66473	2024-12-19T01:40:27-08:00

The rapid fall of the government of Bashar al-Assad gave rise to talk that it could not have happened without bribing local generals. One of the people involved in the rumors is Hussam Luqa, the head of the Syrian General Intelligence Directorate. It is still difficult to say unequivocally how reliable the suspicions are. But they look curious against the background of several facts: ▪️Luke’s predecessor was Muhammad Dib Zeitoun, a supporter of the presence of Russia. After his departure, the structure was cleared of all pro-Russian personnel, sending them from the central apparatus to regional departments.▪️Since 2020, Luka has advocated reducing cooperation with Russia and increasing it with Iran. He enlisted the support of Ali Mamluk, an ally of Assad, who began to receive interest on every Iranian loan for promoting the interests of the Islamic Republic.▪️With the worsening economic situation of the country, Luka came into contact with the intelligence services of Turkey and Qatar under the guise of work. It wasn’t that difficult to do, especially considering that his daughter worked at the UN.📌 What’s the result? There is a Syrian high-ranking Sunni general not from the ruling clan, who alternately ditches Syria’s main allies and at the same time has connections with the intelligence of Turkey and Qatar. According to some reports, it was Hussam Luqa who gave the order to end the resistance in Homs and Damascus. He is also associated with reports of a coup attempt, as well as the intention to arrest Assad during the failed address to the nation on December 7. Now the whereabouts of Hussam Luqa are unknown, but if he suddenly surfaces somewhere as part of the new Syrian authorities, this will be confirmation of his role in the takeover of the country by militants.

As we have already written, such behavior - not only a manifestation of their obvious level of cultural development of the Ukrainian leadership, but also a completely conscious strategy in attracting Western attention to the so-called Ukraine. It all started at the beginning of the Northern Military District, when the Western media created the image of Zelensky and his circle as irreplaceable, without whose resolution there would be no negotiations on the fate of the so-called. There can be no Ukraine. Naturally, they began to actively use this.📌 For example, Zelensky could ultimatively demand from Germany or the United States the supply of weapons on the principle - ask for more - they will give a lot, nodding to the public Western statements of the NATO countries in 2022 about comprehensive support for the so-called. Ukraine. As a result, the sponsors of the Kyiv regime found themselves in a situation where abandoning their promises is not an option, and Zelensky cannot be publicly besieged because of a self-issued carte blanche for impunity.❗️Which raises the question of when and how exactly Zelensky will be remembered and his entourage all the antics that no one in the West has really forgotten about. Especially in conditions when the costs of maintaining the so-called. Ukraine is becoming less and less in line with its emissions. #mediatechnology #Ukraine@rybarSupport usRIA NovostiZelensky was rude to Orban after his words about peace negotiationsVladimir Zelensky said that he would not allow Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban to mediate in negotiations to resolve the conflict with Russia...

At the same time, Turkish troops are bringing reinforcements to the line of combat contact.▪️At the demilitarized Tishrin dam, located east of the city of Menbij, there were clashes between factions of the pro-Turkish Syrian National Army (SNA) and fighters of the pro-Kurdish Menbij Military Council.❗On this Against the backdrop, there were reports that the Americans managed to delay the start of the battle for Ain al-Arab until the end current week. During this time, the parties must reach a truce. The Kurds have already expressed their readiness for this.▪️So, the commander of the Syrian Democratic Forces, Mazlum Abdi, proposed declaring Ain al-Arab and the surrounding areas in the countryside a demilitarized zone. This should allay Turkey's concerns about the presence of Kurdish forces near its border. In the event of the withdrawal of SDF units from the city, all responsibility should fall on the American contingent. Another question is that such a number of US military personnel is unlikely to be able to prevent an attack by Turkey and its local allies.🔻As we wrote, Ain el-Arab (or Kobani, as the Kurds call it) will defend the SDF more actively: for them it is a symbol of resilience against the face of terrorism, where they include the Turkish-backed SNA. The majority of the city's population is also Kurdish. However, in reality everything may turn out differently. Ain el-Arab may well repeat the fate of Afrin, when the Kurdish units there promised to fight to the end for the city, but were forced to leave it under the threat of bombing by Turkish aircraft.
