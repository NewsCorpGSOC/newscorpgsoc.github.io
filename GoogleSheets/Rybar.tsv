In the West Bank, Israeli security forces continue to conduct police operations to detain suspected Palestinians and destroy the homes of Hamas members. The military wing of Hamas, represented by the Kataib Izz ad-Din al-Qassam group, fired rockets at Tel Aviv for the first time since May, but failed to cause damage. After this, the IDF announced an operation near Bani Suheil, where the launch positions were located. An exchange of strikes continues on the border with Lebanon, during one of which an Israeli drone destroyed another vehicle with Hezbollah members. Pro-Iranian formations, despite statements about an inevitable response to Israel for the murder Ismail Haniya, nothing has been done yet. In the Red Sea, two incidents involving explosions near two ships located there were noted. 🔻A detailed analytical report on events in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_botHigh resolution mapEnglish version#digest #map #Israel #Palestine #report@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62746	2024-08-13T12:57:10-07:00

According to journalists, the shipment of radars from the complex has already begun to the Islamic Republic.▪️Later, Reuters, citing some sources in European intelligence, reported the upcoming transfer to Russia of operational-tactical missile systems - Fatah-360 - and satellite-guided missiles with a range of up to 120 km. According to them, Russian military personnel allegedly even began training for these OTRK. At first glance, there are no fundamental obstacles to such bilateral interaction between Russia and Iran. However, such news indicating almost specific dates for upcoming deliveries of military products should be taken with a certain degree of skepticism. We recently mentioned some reasons - Russian enterprises are now focused on fulfilling the State Defense Order. It is unlikely that in such conditions there are -free-S-400 and other modern systems in warehouses that could be taken and transferred to a third party at the first request.🔻Another illustration is the supply of former -Egyptian-Su-35S fighters to Iran - they say about them since 2022, but there is still no actual evidence of this. And there have been rumors about the imminent transfer of Iranian ballistic missiles to the Russian Armed Forces almost from the very beginning of the Northern Military District. Therefore, it is not very advisable to take the word of such sensational reports from Western news agencies. And in general, they demonstrate that journalists are not aware of many aspects of Russian-Iranian interaction.#Iran #Russia@rybarSupport usReutersExclusive: Iran to deliver hundreds of ballistic missiles to Russia soon, intel sources sayFath-360s could allow Russia to use more of its arsenal for targets beyond the Ukraine front line.	https://t.me/rybar/62745	2024-08-13T12:05:48-07:00

The ruling party - Georgian Dream - Democratic Georgia - has officially stated that it was former President Mikheil Saakashvili who is guilty of unleashing the -five-day war- of 2008. Moreover, it was stated that he acted as a -traitor- on instructions from outside. This gesture will be appreciated not only in Russia (yes, it will certainly have a beneficial effect on bilateral relations between countries), but also in the West. Saakashvili's official admission of guilt is primarily a blow to his remaining supporters before the October elections and a response to a number of unfriendly actions against Georgia by the United States and the EU. These include the recent suspension of European financial assistance and visits of State Department officials to Georgia in order to support opposition NGOs.🔻In the current conditions, there is little doubt that the pressure on the Georgian authorities will only increase, since they see more benefits in, if not friendly, but stable relations with Russia. And it is quite obvious that they will again try to use Saakashvili in the interests of the opposition as a unifying figure in order to rock the protests. But now, at least, Tbilisi will have a new serious argument to finish off its reputation as an alien - a puppet who started a war -. #Georgia #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramTina Kandelaki	https://t.me/rybar/62744	2024-08-13T11:12:18-07:00

The debut of these vehicles in the Northern Military District zone took place a year ago during the battles in the Zaporozhye direction. Then the Ukrainian Armed Forces brought into battle 82 airborne assault brigades from the Marun tactical group, which was armed with these vehicles. Since the summer of 2023, Russian military personnel have destroyed about a dozen Strykers, but until now they have not been able to capture the entire vehicle. However, now the defect (if you can even call it that) has been corrected. At the same time, during the week there was enough footage on the Internet of the destruction of American armored personnel carriers in the Kursk region. Taking into account the objective difficulties of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in evacuating equipment, the collection of captured Strykers will clearly be replenished in the near future.#Kursk #Russia #USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegram SOLOVIEV📹EXCLUSIVE | SOLOVIOVLIVE Soldiers from the 810th Separate Guards Marine Brigade are dragging a captured American armored fighting vehicle -Stryker.

Ukrainian formations use aviation to strike the border area - the use of JDAM-ER guided bombs was noted against a local granary in Tetkino.🔻In the Korenevsky district, Russian troops are repelling attacks on the approaches to the settlements of Kauchuk and Alekseevsky, surrounded on several sides by forest belts and a reservoir. Also, footage of an attack on an abandoned enemy armored vehicle on the highway north of Kauchuk with Lancet loitering ammunition appeared on the Internet. In a similar way, tanks were hit a few days ago in Novoivanovka, and before that in Zeleny Shlyakh.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, Russian troops hit the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the area of ​​Oleshnya, Mikhailovka and Sudzha. According to preliminary data, in Sumy, the Sumy Cardiology Center and the War Veterans Hospital, where members of the Ukrainian formations are being treated, were attacked. In order to reduce leaks of information about the movements of Ukrainian equipment and the results of fire damage, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine introduced restrictions on the movement of civilians in the 20-kilometer zone of the Sumy region: now only local citizens registered at their place of residence can be there. At the same time, the configuration of the front in Plekhovo, southeast of Sudzha: footage of drone strikes on enemy armored vehicles at the exit from the village has been published. This confirms that the settlement was previously lost by the Russian Armed Forces. Voluntary evacuation of the population has begun in the Bolshesoldatsky district, the authorities are collecting lists of citizens who want to leave the region. In the Belovsky district, Russian troops are clearing the surrounding area to the settlement of Ozerki. Most likely, it was from here that Ukrainian formations carried out an unsuccessful raid on Giryi yesterday.❗️Ukrainian IPsO continue to actively carry out injections in the media field: for example, in the morning the enemy announced the alleged capture of employees of the IK-3 executive colony several kilometers from Lgov. But this message is a fake, which can be seen at least from the presence in the frame of the M1126 Stryker armored personnel carrier with a mine trawl destroyed on the first day of the invasion.

🖼 🇹🇯🇨🇳🪖 About the Chinese military base in Tajikistan In th...	🇹🇯🇨🇳🪖 About the Chinese military base in Tajikistan An old topic has resurfaced in the Central Asian information field. At a press conference on August 8, First Deputy Head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Tajikistan Abdurahmon Alamshozoda said that rumors about the construction of a certain base in the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region (GBAO) with the participation of the PRC are not true. Beijing also denies everything. Prior to this, the last time the construction of such a base was discussed was in October 2021. ❓What made the official remember this after almost three years? Recently, the British The Daily Telegraph published material about a secret Chinese military base based on new satellite images. The purpose of its construction, according to the newspaper, is to contain the activity of the Afghan Taliban. The British are expressing concerns about the growth of Chinese influence in the country. In 2021, Dushanbe announced that a base in GBAO would appear in the future. But we were talking about the special forces base of the Organized Crime Control Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Tajikistan, and it was supposed to be built with Chinese money in the Ishkashim region. The base, the existence of which is denied by the Deputy Head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Tatarstan and claimed by The Daily Telegraph, is located in the Murgab region near the village of Shaimak, has been built by China for almost 10 years, and Chinese military personnel are already stationed there. Tajik sources confirmed the presence of the object to journalists. Probably, we are talking about two different bases, or a second one is being built under the cover of the first. Beijing and Dushanbe have a mutual interest in the Chinese military presence in Tajikistan. The Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region has long caused problems for the central government: the region, which is both ethnically and religiously different from the rest of the country, has repeatedly experienced serious unrest. The last time the Pamirs flared up was in May 2022, and the unrest was suppressed. Sinophobia is also strong in Gorno-Badakhshan. By allowing the Chinese into the region, Dushanbe hopes that Beijing will help suppress separatism. The PRC, in addition to containing the Taliban’s potential aggression against Tajikistan, is interested in preventing the region from becoming a source of an Islamist threat to the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, and in protecting its investments. The threat has a place to come from: Gorno-Badakhshan borders on the Afghan Wakhan Corridor - a narrow strip of land that gives China a common border with Afghanistan. If the British newspaper hoped that with its publication it could cause damage to Russia and the CSTO, then this is unlikely to happen. On the contrary, it is beneficial for Moscow to share the burden of responsibility for security in the region with Beijing. After all, the danger of escalation remains: Tajikistan actively supports the armed opposition to the Taliban regime. And the inclusive government that demands the creation of Dushanbe, and which should include representatives of Afghan Tajiks, has not yet been created.

However, such frankly primitive videos that the enemy tried to distribute in the Russian segment, in fact, can also lead to some effect. For example, during times of uncertainty, even obvious fakes can disperse panic according to the principle - a lie repeated a thousand times is perceived as the truth. into it the necessary narrative. Accordingly, in some cases, the best way to combat such crookedly put together fakes is to simply ignore them, not allowing them to be -legalized- in your own information field.

In the Yuzhdonetsk direction, Russian troops have already reached the key route T-05-24 in several places, according to which supplied the Ukrainian Armed Forces garrison in Ugledar. At the same time, the assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces achieved significant success in Konstantinovka, overcoming the defensive lines of the Ukrainian formations in the south-eastern part of the village. ▪️After lengthy battles on the approaches to Konstantinovka, Russian troops were able to break through the enemy’s defenses and advance into the populated area itself. Units of the Russian Armed Forces took advantage of the terrain and attacked the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the southern outskirts of the village. entrenched in the eastern part of Chkalova Street. Somewhere around August 10, assault groups knocked out Ukrainian formations from positions on Shevchenko, Mira and Shakhterskaya streets on the eastern outskirts of the village. After this, units of the Russian Armed Forces began systematically pushing back Ukrainian formations to the central part of the village. Despite the resistance of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, by the evening of August 12, the advanced assault groups were able to knock out the enemy from several more positions and pull up their right flank, reaching the left bank of the Sukhie Yaly River. The enemy regularly uses attack drones, as evidenced by objective control footage. ▪️To the southeast of Vodyanoye there are fierce battles on the approaches to the T-05-24 highway. After several months of battles in the Ikryana and Solenenkaya gullies, Russian troops were able to approach and take fire control of the transport artery in several more places. This makes it almost impossible for the enemy to use it to supply the garrisons of Ugledar and Konstantinovka. A further offensive in this area in the future will allow the Russian Armed Forces to bypass the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Konstantinovka and its environs from the south and take the section of the S-05-11-33 Katerynivka - Konstantinovka highway under fire control, significantly complicating the supply of the latter’s garrison. 🔻However, to implement this scenario, Russian troops will have to overcome the enemy’s defenses northwest of the highway and liberate Vodyanoye. Ukrainian formations, understanding the prospects opening up for the command of the Russian Armed Forces after the capture of this village, will strive to stop the advance of Russian troops in the area and will probably use significant forces to do this. The liberation of Vodyanoy is also complicated by the control of Ukrainian formations over the territories of the Yuzhnodonbasskaya No. 1- and No. 3 mines. The crushing and screening buildings of both mines allow enemy observers to monitor tens of kilometers around using both visual surveillance and specialized cameras. Air strikes using various types of ammunition are regularly carried out on the territory of the mines, but it is difficult to destroy such permanent structures even with air bombs.

The representative of the German defense department, Arne Collatz, confirmed this information, noting that their personalities should serve as an example of military valor for the Bundeswehr. According to him, the list represents Wehrmacht officers who, after the fall of the Third Reich, distanced themselves from their past and participated in the construction of the Bundeswehr. Examples for the younger generation include: ▪️Brigadier General Heinz Karst, awarded the Iron Cross 1st class on the Eastern Front; ▪️Colonel Erich Hartmann - considered -the most successful fighter pilot in the history of aviation- (352 aerial victories, 344 of which over Soviet aircraft);▪️Rear Admiral Erich Topp - one of the most successful submariners of the Second World War, as well as a member of the SS. This fact did not prevent him, after the war, from building a career in the German Navy, receiving the Cross of Merit for the Federal Republic of Germany and serving as a staff officer in the NATO military committee in Washington.🔻As we can see, the Bundeswehr heroes found in the dustbin of history actively fought against the Soviet people. Whether this is one of the features of German revanchism is a rhetorical question. The bottom line is this: in Berlin they understand that no matter how much they pour into their armed forces, the Bundeswehr military machine is unlikely to work without ideological fuel. We need an image of the enemy and it will obviously become Russia.#Germany @rybar together with @de_adlerSupport usTelegramÜbersicht Ukraine🇩🇪☄️Traditionserlass bei der Bundeswehr: Mehr Wehrmacht wagen - TAZ📌 Gestern berichteten wir von den Kriegsvorbereitungen in Deutschland wobei es unteranderem dar um ging die Gesellschaft für den Kriegseintritt Deutschlands vorzubereiten.

One of them is the need for cooperation in the field of regional security and defense policy. The frontmen were the heads of two leading states in the region: President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev and President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev. It is no coincidence that such proposals sparked a discussion about how new projects will coexist with the CSTO and SCO formats: Tokayev raised the question of forming an indivisible security space and creating its regional architecture. Mirziyoyev went even further and proposed developing an entire Concept at once. What threats do the heads of state of Central Asia see? Along the perimeter of the region, according to Tokayev, a difficult military-political situation remains - apparently, this also applies to the Russian border. The head of Uzbekistan expressed himself more specifically, pointing out that what is happening in the so-called. Ukraine and the Middle East affect the stability and sustainability of regional development. The geopolitical position of Central Asia makes the region hostage to sanctions policy. The situation in Afghanistan, according to Mirziyoyev, has faded into the background.🔻For now, the parties are holding meetings of security secretaries. In this format, the secretaries of the Security Councils of Russia and India met with their Central Asian colleagues. Plans for the near future include the development of a Catalog of security risks for Central Asia and measures to prevent them. The region is obviously not yet ready to create a full-fledged defense union. The reason for this is disagreement both within existing formats and a different list of priority potential enemies. The states of the region are reacting to external stimuli without having a convincing answer as to why the defensive alliance should be in this particular format. However, as in the case of the issue of Central Asian identity, it is clear that the discussion has started, and if desired, a solution will be developed. #Kazakhstan #Uzbekistan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62737	2024-08-13T05:23:48-07:00

🇺🇸 About the progress of the presidential campaign in the USA D...	🇺🇸 About the progress of the presidential campaign in the USA Despite the fact that less than a month has passed since US President Joe Biden refused the nomination, the balance of power in the struggle for the presidency has changed significantly. And not in favor of Donald Trump: the Republican, who previously led in all polls, began to face troubles. This is due to the so-called honeymoon of Kamala Harris - after the elderly and always stammering Biden, the young and energetic Harris is basking in the attention of the press, collecting record donations and dominates the information space of American social networks. Harris is doing well with her funding - in July, the Democrat managed to raise $310 million compared to the $138.7 million raised by Trump. According to polls, she is also ahead of her Republican opponent in three key states, including the important Pennsylvania. Trump understands that he no longer controls the election agenda, which is why he is becoming increasingly nervous in public and making old mistakes - be very and uncontrollably rude, as well as make harsh statements. Moreover, he is no longer able to improvise as well as when his opponent was Biden. We have to be more constructive and not just criticize the opponent for his age. His allies and donors are concerned and note that the current approach greatly harms Trump's already scandalous image, making voters think that the Democratic opponent is focused solely on himself and personal revenge. But Trump continues to stick to the old line. Insiders said donors at a recent meeting with Trump in the Hamtons expressed hope that he would recalibrate his campaign after a series of devastating mistakes. Instead, the politician again began to talk about the stolen elections and declare that he would -put an end to fraud- in 2020, although his advisers had previously urged him to abandon such statements and move in a more constructive direction. All these problems are further complicated by the fact that Kamala Harris masterfully and unashamedly steals from Donald Trump his most successful and attractive election promises. For example, she recently followed her political opponent in advocating the abolition of taxes on tips in the country. The former president, in turn, clumsily shoots back at the fact that Harris has photoshopped people into himself in report photos from his rallies.❗️In general, Trump badly needs a relaunch or a successful debate, as a result of which he could publicly humiliate his rival. Speaking is really not Kamala’s strong point - she, knowing this, cunningly avoids unplanned meetings with the press. However, he also cannot refuse to go to fight with Trump, since the voter will consider this a weakness. Judging by Trump's statements, the parties have agreed on dates for the debates - September 4, 10 and 25 on Fox, ABC and NBC. Until they take place, it is pointless to talk with confidence about the chances of victory of one or another candidate - as practice has shown, failure at such an event can cost a politician the whole race. The battle between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris this year will be Pennsylvania, the swing state with the most electoral votes.

Ukrainian formations were active in the area of ​​Snagost, Korenevo and Martynovka, although they were unable to advance anywhere. 🔻Suja’s status is still unclear - judging by the lack of fresh personnel on both sides of the front, neither the Russian Armed Forces nor the Armed Forces of Ukraine have complete control over the city. At the same time, the enemy has not yet given up attempts to advance in the direction of Rylsk, Lgov and Kurchatov, while simultaneously gaining a foothold on the captured lines. In parallel, there are movements of forces in the Sumy region: for example, movements of armored vehicles have been recorded in the Glukhov area.

Tel Aviv sold billions of dollars worth of weapons to the Azerbaijanis, and Israeli intelligence services and the military played a significant role in planning and approving the operation in Artsakh.▪️In addition to the commercial interest of the Israelis in supporting Azerbaijan (sales of weapons and purchase of oil), the key role was played by the opportunity to get closer through Artsakh to borders of Iran. ▪️So it would not be surprising if Baku actually agreed to the deployment of Israeli bases in Artsakh in exchange for full support. ▪️At the same time, for Iran, the sovereignty of Armenia is perhaps much more important than for the current Armenian authorities. Tehran has recently been saying every day that they do not accept border changes in the region, referring to the situation around the Syunik region and the opening of the so-called -Zangezur corridor - through Armenia, which should connect Turkey and Azerbaijan. ▪️The other day, Baku unexpectedly announced that they had agreed to exclude the corridor issue from the peace treaty with Armenia and postpone it until later. The unexpected compromise is associated with Azerbaijan’s desire to conclude a peace treaty with Armenia as soon as possible. ▪️However, it cannot be ruled out that the postponement of the corridor issue, among other things, was prompted by Iran’s position and its threats against Israel. This is evidenced, in particular, by the fact that the IDF leadership decided to withdraw its military from Azerbaijan due to fear of revenge from Iran. ▪️The possible deployment by Israel of its missiles in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, an Azerbaijani exclave, also remains a sensitive issue for Iran and Armenia.🔻The tension of recent weeks in the region clearly passes by Armenian diplomacy, which remains silent and does not express a single reproach to regional players who threaten security of Armenia. This situation is yet another proof that Armenia is losing its political sovereignty and Yerevan’s opinion is simply not interesting to anyone. #Azerbaijan #Armenia #Israel #Iran @rybarSupport uswww.aysor.amIn Iranian circles, discussions have intensified about the location of Israeli secret military facilities in Artsakh and threats, and the authorities...Today, more than ever, the Azerbaijani factor is used in operations against Iran, from reconnaissance to training possible operations.	https://t.me/rybar/62732	2024-08-13T02:39:01-07:00

Thus, the majority of the population does not have access to electricity, which complicates the economic situation.
