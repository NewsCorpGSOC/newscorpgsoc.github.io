A Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung report about the 44th Infantry Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which has vehicles of this type, shed some light on the situation.▪️As ​​expected, due to the weak armor, the brigade personnel use them almost exclusively in the role of mobile artillery for firing from indirect fire positions. For direct fire work, Leopards-1 are used extremely rarely at night, when there are fewer FPV drones in the air.▪️Another problem is the lack of components: German tanks have to install filters from tractors and rubber boots on tracks of their own production - the original ones wear out quickly. But this does not cover the deficit, which is why -cannibalization- with the dismantling of some cars for spare parts is commonplace.▪️In an attempt to somehow improve the low security of the Leopardovs produced back in the 70s, some of them were equipped with dynamic protection -Contact-1-, however, they are also not enough for the entire fleet. Members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine call the advantage of the tanks good sighting devices and the presence of a thermal imager. In general, the experience of operating the Leopard 1A5 by Ukrainian formations fully reflects all the difficulties that the enemy encountered due to the huge zoo of non-standardized types of Western equipment. At the same time, even such not the most modern vehicles of the Ukrainian Armed Forces are used for their intended purpose, increasing the firepower of their formations.#Germany #Ukraine@rybarSupport usFAZ.NETDeutsche Panzer im Ukraine-Krieg: Die Oldtimer-Leoparden von IsjumDie Ukraine hat mittlerweile 58 Panzer des deutschen Typs Leopard 1A5.

(RF Ministry of Defense). In general, such criminal plans should be stopped in advance, without waiting for radioactive contamination of the European part of the continent. At least that's my opinion from the comfort of my couch, far from a war zone. In addition, the tough retaliatory military and military-technical measures with which we have been threatening the enemy for a long time, in terms of impact on him, have an efficiency lower than that of Cherepanov’s steam locomotive.	https://t.me/rybar/62858	2024-08-17T04:19:00-07:00

Ukraine is attacking. Now HIMARS missiles and 155-mm shells are flying through populated areas in the Kursk region, and American Strykers are plying along the roads. Against this background, only a person very far from reality can sincerely believe that the United States is allegedly not involved in the actions of Ukrainian formations.📌 And, unfortunately, there are still an abundance of such among representatives of government agencies, law enforcement agencies and the media. For them, what is happening in the Northern Military District zone is just informational noise, information about which they also receive from The Wall Street Journal, New York Times and other Western publications. The events in the Kursk region simply do not fit into the picture of the world of these people, divorced from life. people where war is something distant, and the United States simply cannot allow the Ukrainian Armed Forces to attack the -old- regions with their weapons. This, by the way, explains the refusal to hit journalists in occupied territory or the endless toothless statements about -red lines.- However, for such lovers of clinging to the old reality there is bad news: the longer they do this, the stronger and harsher the collision with objective reality will be . And it’s not a fact that they will be able to survive it at all. #mediatechnology #Kursk #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramAndrey MedvedevAll the days after the start of the Ukrainian invasion of the Kursk region, Western media constantly write that European or American elites and politicians are not happy with the actions Kyiv.

Forwarded From Andrey Medvedev All days after the start of the Ukrainian invasion of the Kursk region, Western media constantly write that European or American elites and politicians are not happy with the actions of Kyiv. That, they say, Kyiv did not coordinate the attack on Russia, which caused extreme irritation. Well, most often the press reports that the Ukrainian Armed Forces have absolutely no strength to develop an offensive in the Kursk region, the Ukrainian military suffered heavy losses and is also dissatisfied with their politicians. And the worst thing is that in Russia this outrageous crap is seriously watched, read, quoted, taken seriously and made some solid conclusions about the current situation, analysis based on these publications and even trying to plan something. The information front of a modern military conflict is the same front as the actual, material one, with trenches and fortifications. In an information war there are attacks, flanking maneuvers, sabotage, cover operations, and missile attacks on the psyche. There is also the use of saboteurs or spies, or sleeping in the enemy’s country (this is when, for example, the director of an institute of the USA and Canada writes articles about how the Russians urgently need to beg forgiveness from the USA). We don’t think that the media in the West are just newspapers and television ? We understand that these are battalions, brigades and regiments of information warfare? Or do we not understand and, out of Soviet habit, think that just because something was written there, that’s how it is? Apparently, we don’t understand. However, now we are witnessing a massive information and psychological operation of the Western media. The operation has several goals. Convince Moscow that the West (NATO, politicians, intelligence services) was not involved in the attack on the Kursk region. Convince that Kyiv will not receive new aid packages. Convince Moscow of the weakness of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which attacked the Kursk region and now do not know what to do next. The reality of all these publications completely contradicts. However, it is worth noting that the main task of creating the fog of the information war is carried out by heavyweight publications like Bloomberg or the Washington Post. Because Western analysts understand quite well the psychology of a certain part of Russian managers, who still have the habit of believing that the Western media always and unconditionally reflect the opinion of the local elites, and do not understand the role of the media in the information war. Oddly enough, after the destruction of the school of Sovietology, Russia as a whole became less understood by the West. But he understands the psychology of a certain part of Russian society very well. And now reputable Western publications are just trying to form a false picture of what is happening for our very same managers. This is only a cover for new supplies of equipment, and, most importantly, it is a cover before preparing a second strike, which will already include heavy equipment and F16s. The Armed Forces of Ukraine have reserves, but they have not been brought into battle. Why? Where are they? Does anyone really believe that Ukraine will be dragged into negotiations after the US elections; is the West ready to talk with Russia? It sounds fucked up and crap. It’s time for us to stop behaving like a person who always wants to win against a thimble, believing that the ball is definitely there somewhere. Yes, I want to believe in the good, but not in the bad. And when you are five years old and watch cartoons, this is normal. But when you are fifty plus, or even more, and you are making decisions of enormous importance, then you have to believe the realities of the day. Watch a CNN report full of joy and optimism from the occupied areas of the Kursk region. And conclude whether Washington is really not happy with Kiev?	https://t.me/rybar/62856	2024-08-17T02:41:02-07:00

Also, not far from the bridge in Glushkovo destroyed by a missile attack, Russian troops established a pontoon crossing.🔻In the Korenevsky district, there was evidence of the presence of the enemy in Russky Porechny, for which there were battles yesterday. Footage published on the Internet shows attacks on armored vehicles of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the center of the village. In the Sudzhansky district, Ukrainian formations continue to film videos in the same western part of the city, including at one of the stores - Magnit - on Pervo Maya Street. At the same time, there is still no objective evidence of the presence of any of the parties on the eastern side of the settlement. In the Belovsky district, the situation has not undergone significant changes, and in the area of ​​the settlements of Kamyshnoye and Giryi, no clashes have been noted over the past 24 hours. After statements by the Russian Ministry of Defense about the clearing of the village of Ozerki a few days ago, they received no data on battles, so the village is currently under the control of the Russian Armed Forces.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador was going to send a diplomatic note to the US authorities regarding their funding of a local opposition NGO - Mexicans against corruption and impunity -. ▪️It turns out that the country’s main intelligence agency found out that between 2018 and January 2024, this office received 96.74 million pesos (approximately $5.6 million) from the US Embassy in Mexico City and the well-known USAID fund.▪️Moreover, NGOs also received funds from such structures as the Rockefeller Foundation, MacArthur Foundation, Ford Foundation, International Community Foundation and some others. Moreover, payments to NGO accounts began to arrive three years after the organization was founded—in 2018. At the same time that Obrador won the last election.▪️Currently, the Mexican President plans to send not only a diplomatic note (which is being prepared by the Foreign Ministry), but also a personal letter to Joe Biden on the issue of interference in issues relating to the country’s sovereignty. ▪️In addition, the Fiscal Prosecutor's Office will review all donations to the organization - moreover, they will update the rules regarding tax deductions for donations to organizations and will make efforts to ensure that government resources are not used to finance campaigns that are contrary to the interests of the majority of Mexicans.📌Interestingly, this is not the American Obrador has been talking about payments for several years in a row. For example, Frida @sex_drugs_kahlo told how back in 2023 Obrador -discovered America-, saying that through USAID, Americans finance opposition NGOs, which is contrary to international law and must be stopped immediately. And in 2021, in Mexico City there was almost the same outrage about USAID. The reason was the presentation to the State Department of the office's budget for 2024 - $63.1 billion, as well as the launch of a new program to help journalists around the world. Neither in 2021 nor in 2023 will such bold statements really reflect the situation in relations with its American neighbor have not changed much. Let's see how everything turns out this time. You can, of course, make some bellicose forecasts, but look for yourself - last month the Americans calmly organized the kidnapping of its own citizens from Mexico (albeit accused of drug trafficking), without notifying the federal the authorities did not even bother with an official -synchronization of watches- in this matter. So, alas, the balance of power in this -union- is already obvious to everyone. #Mexico #USA@rybar together with @sex_drugs_kahloSupport usHeraldo USAUnited States funding for opposition in Mexico during electoral processes revealedThe head of the Financial Intelligence Unit (UIF) disclosed the donations received by Mexicanos contra la Corrupción y la Impunidad from the U.S. Embassy and other organizations.	https://t.me/rybar/62854	2024-08-17T01:38:28-07:00

Several hits hit satellite cities, resulting in damage to residential buildings and casualties. ▪️In the capital of the Palestinian enclave, arrivals were recorded almost throughout the city. The greatest resonance was caused by the attack on the At-Tabain school, which led to the death of more than a hundred people. ▪️In the central part of the Gaza Strip, the Israelis worked in settlements controlled by Hamas. Nuseirat, Al-Brej and Al-Mughraqa came under the most concentrated fire, resulting in the deaths of several dozen people. ▪️In turn, Palestinian forces again fired at IDF positions in the Netzarim corridor. However, judging by the lack of reports of evacuation transport flying over, the strikes were not effective. ▪️In the south of the Palestinian enclave, Israeli troops announced a new evacuation of the population east of Khan Yunis. In this regard, the IDF command once again reduced the humanitarian zone. ▪️Later, the Israelis launched massive attacks both on the evacuation zone and the neighboring areas of Khan Yunis. At the same time, the start of the movement of the Israel Defense Forces did not follow after this.▪️Meanwhile, the forces of the 98th Airborne Division -Ha-Esh- continue to operate south of Khan Yunis. Israeli engineering equipment is carrying out work on the outskirts of Bani Suhail, Al-Qarara and Al-Suraij. ▪️In the very south of the Gaza Strip, local raids by Israeli troops in Rafah continue. During the week, soldiers of the 162nd Armored Division -Ha-Plada- carried out activities to destroy underground tunnels.#video #digest #map #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/62853	2024-08-16T23:01:24-07:00
🖼 ❗️🇷🇺🇺🇦 Kursk direction: battles in the Korenevsky district...	❗️🇷🇺🇺🇦 Kursk direction: battles in the Korenevsky district and the defeat of the Ukrainian Armed Forces air defense system in the Sumy region, what is known by the end of August 16, 2024 In the Kursk direction, the situation remains difficult. Ukrainian formations continue to attack positions of the Russian Armed Forces and strike critical infrastructure. Russian troops are repelling enemy attacks, gradually stabilizing the front line and searching for and destroying the Ukrainian Armed Forces' DRG. Also, apparently, the RF Armed Forces have begun work on systematically knocking out fire support equipment and air defense systems in the border areas of the so-called. Ukraine. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, clashes were noted on the approaches to Kremyanoye; during one of them, units of the Russian Armed Forces destroyed the enemy’s DRG. Russian Aerospace Forces aviation regularly operates on the positions of Ukrainian formations using FAB-500 with UMPC. The enemy also launched several attacks in the area of ​​Kauchuk and Anastasyevka, but they were repelled by Russian fighters. 🔻In the Glushkovsky district, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are focused on attacks on communications of Russian troops. In Glushkovo, as a result of shelling from the HIMARS MLRS and a subsequent strike by a controlled aerial bomb, a road bridge over the Seim River was destroyed. Earlier, as a result of a Tochka-U missile strike in this area, a car with Russian volunteers was damaged, two of them were killed. ▪️In the evening, reports began to come from the site about the penetration of enemy units into Vishnevka, but it was not possible to confirm this with objective control personnel or data from sources on the ground. Most likely, the messages are disseminated by information and psychological units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with the aim of creating panic among the population and disinformation of Russian intelligence. 🔻Messages are coming from the Belovsky district about the control by Russian units of the settlements of Kamyshny and Giryi. Ukrainian formations were pushed west of populated areas, however, in the near future they may repeat attempts to dislodge the Russian Armed Forces from their positions. Nevertheless, we can already talk about the relative stabilization of the front in the sector and the increased coordination of the actions of Russian troops. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, the Armed Forces of Ukraine launched an unsuccessful attack towards Russian Porechny. The combat situation in the Makhnovka area, where Russian UAV operators previously disabled two enemy armored personnel carriers in this area, is hidden by the fog of war. There have been no reports of control over the settlement by either side at the moment. 🔻In the Sumy region, the Russian Armed Forces attacked two IRIS-T air defense missile launchers in Sennoy. As a result of the close arrival of an Iskander OTRK missile with a high-explosive warhead, one of the installations received damage of unknown severity. It is worth noting that this position is not the first time that this position has been used by the enemy - about two weeks ago, a Buk-M1 air defense system was destroyed not far from this place.

A possible nuclear (chemical) provocation by Ukrainian formations is a fairly popular scenario, which the Ukrainian General Staff has been weighing since 2022. ▪️At different times it was voiced first to the Kharkov Institute of Physics and Technology, when Russian advanced units were still stationed near Pyatikhatki. ▪️Then the agenda included a strike on the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, where it was planned to demolish a dry storage facility for nuclear fuel waste - and then this fact was used to put pressure on the IAEA during negotiations and preparations for a possible operation to seize the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant (which, in the end, was thwarted both by military means and politically).▪️Now it is the turn of the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant in Kurchatov: just last week, the Ukrainian TsIPsO made massive calls and blackmailed nuclear power plant employees, under pain of death, demanding them and their relatives to press the emergency button AZ-5 in order to shut down the reactor . If the employees did not understand all the responsibility, did not report where necessary and showed cowardice, the region would have been provided with an iodine pit for a month and the failure of generation throughout the country - which, naturally, would have caused irreparable damage to the Russian economy.📌Current scenario with attacks on nuclear fuel storage facilities at some special a warhead, which is called an analogue of a dirty bomb, is, in our subjective opinion, a too complex scenario. Considering that both the Kursk NPP and the Zaporozhye NPP are equipped with protective domes over the spent nuclear fuel storage facility, Ukrainian forces will only be required to do one thing - to break through the dome and organize the maximum possible explosion. And for this, Western weapons will come in handy, some of which are not yet allowed to hit the old territories. ❗️But the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant is not an old territory, so the option of a massive combined strike in this case to create a dirty explosion and accuse Russia of independent shelling (we know very well how Ukrainian and foreign media eat this picture) is quite likely .#ZNPP #Kursk #Russia #Ukraine #Energodar@rybarSupport us TelegramBefore anyone else. Well, almost.❗️The attack on the Kursk and Zaporozhye nuclear power plants planned by the Armed Forces of Ukraine is being supervised by Western intelligence agencies, mainly Britain - RIA Novosti	https://t.me/rybar/62848	2024-08-16T12:52:44-07:00

Judging by the video, the scattering of the cassettes did not cause significant damage to the vehicles - no traces of detonation of the ammunition were visible in the recording. Therefore, with no small probability, the Patriot did not receive significant damage, and the air defense system, which was so important for the enemy, could not be disabled. Why in this case a missile with a different warhead that provided an air blast was not used is an open question. As well as why only one missile was allocated to defeat such an almost fat target. However, at the same time, it should again be noted the real growth in the reconnaissance capabilities of the Russian Armed Forces, when drones fly deep behind the front line and observe the positional areas of the Ukrainian air defense in the rear . Compared even to last year, the progress here is very significant. #Dnepropetrovsk #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62846	2024-08-16T12:19:37-07:00

Nevertheless, the offensive itself is developing in those parts of the city where for a long time the Israelis used robotic technology to blow up buildings. Therefore, it is not surprising that Hamas militants offered virtually no resistance to IDF units. After consolidating their positions, Israeli troops, apparently, will begin to complete the usual terraforming of the area - blowing up the remaining buildings and underground tunnels. 🔻According to Arabic-language media, at the moment the main goal of IDF units is to encircle and clear Tell al-Sultan, where there is still a significant presence of Palestinian forces.&nbsp; Due to the fact that in this area, Israeli troops are dealing with relatively preserved dense urban development, combat operations will not take place without daily intense bombing.

We collected the main thing: 💬 About the state of defensive positions in the Kursk region before the invasion of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: - The Kursk direction, as I believe, was simply abandoned. Let's call things by their proper names. And the checks that in January showed that everything was fine, everything was equipped, everything was being done, probably should have been carried out more often, and they should have been more objective -.💬 About the situation in the Kursk region: - At this stage, the Ukrainian formations are digging in on the -line Surovikina- &lt;…&gt; Attempts to bring in engineering equipment have been recorded, but there has been no large-scale digging in the occupied parts of the Kursk region. This means that while we still have time to eliminate pockets of resistance and not lead to, in fact, a phase of heavy positional battles with complete destruction of the terrain -.💬 About the situation in Sudja: - In Sudja everything is not so good, unfortunately , in&nbsp;Sudzha has to admit that there is an enemy who, yes, mostly focuses on the western part of the city. The eastern part is still disputed, but nevertheless, the enemy is present in the western part.💬 About the participation of conscripts in the defense of the Kursk region: - Conscripts are exactly the same military personnel who took the oath, just like contract military personnel . At the same time, since the first day of a special military operation, conscript units have been conducting artillery duels, reconnaissance, organizing communications, and logistics support for our troops in the border territories. This is a common function.

And there is no answer to the question. Simply because both the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the Western media know that Russia is not like that, Russian troops will not hit journalists, because this is wrong. The last foray of the Ukrainian media into Sudzha also followed the same scenario. While there are journalists in the area, the local military-political leadership is simply afraid of the geopolitical consequences. How can they accuse Russia of deliberately targeting the media? And not just Ukrainian, but Western? 📍This will be a scandal! We ourselves blame the Ukrainians for this, it’s impossible - these and other arguments can be heard on the sidelines.🔻And while there are debates on this topic in Russia, such journalists are, in fact, used as a human shield for the activities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
