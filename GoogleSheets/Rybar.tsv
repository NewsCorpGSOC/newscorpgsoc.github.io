The operation itself has been going on for a week - previously everything was limited to air raids on Hezbollah targets in both border and rear settlements. However, the expected rapid advance of the Israeli troops did not follow; at the moment, only relatively familiar skirmishes are reported in the border zone, including near the small village of Rmeish, where maneuver groups of Israelis operated at night. At the same time, false information is being spread on the Internet about the entry of IDF units into a particular locality or about the complete withdrawal of Lebanese units beyond the Litani River. However, such reports are refuted by both Israeli and Arabic-language media. At the same time, judging by the increasingly frequent statements by the press service of the Israel Defense Forces about the need for all residents of southern Lebanon to urgently evacuate to the north of the country and remain there until the end of hostilities, the Israeli offensive may begin in the near future after observing the necessary politeness. Moreover, That approval for the ground operation has already been received from the United States - last night, American Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, after a conversation with his Israeli colleague Galant, expressed support for the IDF offensive in southern Lebanon. The stated goal of the operation is the destruction of Hezbollah infrastructure near Israel's northern border. #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar❗️🇮🇱🇱🇧 The IDF launched a limited military ground operation against Hezbollah targets in the border zone of southern Lebanon.

Episodes of escapes of Ukrainian men from the TCC, often captured on video, are replete with either comical or tragic events. And sometimes both. The story of one such escape is in our new issue. Synopsis: Not everyone living in the so-called territory. Ukrainian male citizens are still ready to defend certain -ideals- with arms in hand. We can safely say: the number of such people has decreased significantly over more than two years of a special military operation. But the number of those who do not want to be on the line of combat contact has increased manifold. At the territorial recruitment centers (TRCs), there are no longer not only queues, but even small streams of volunteers ready to go to the front even tomorrow. At the same time, military commissars need to recruit people in any case and constantly replenish the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine - young and old, fit and not so fit, fighters. More and more videos are coming from the territory of Ukraine with harsh arrests, which are more reminiscent of robbery attacks. Videos where groups of Ukrainians are detained while trying to cross the border make an equally painful impression. However, this is better than being shot while trying to escape - and recently such stories have appeared...📌 You can download the comic using the links: RU | EN | AR | CN#Russia #Ukraine @rybarWe hope you liked the comic from our artists.

🔁🖼 How the West regulates migration from Central Asia to Russia...	Forwarded From Two MajorsHow the West regulates migration from Central Asia to Russia - article by uv. Comrade Fisherman✨Note that the difficult situation with illegal migration in Russia already in 2021 was reflected in the National Security Strategy of Russia in the form of a clause on Achieving the goals of ensuring state and public security by countering illegal migration, strengthening control over migration flows, social and cultural adaptation and integration of migrants. That is, the task was set by the Supreme Commander before the war. Moreover, already in 2023, the provisions of the Concept of the State Migration Policy of the Russian Federation for 2019 - 2025 were changed, as new challenges arose. At the same time, according to this doctrinal document, an economic justification is provided - in 2012-2017, the migration influx into the Russian Federation compensated for the natural population decline and became a source of additional labor resources for the national economy. The factor of valuable troubleshooting specialists is also stated that a significant proportion consists of low-skilled workers, whose demand is often determined by lower costs compared to the use of labor of citizens of the Russian Federation. Under these conditions, migration to Russia of the broad labor masses is objectively conditioned and inevitable. And this, as Rybar found out, was taken advantage of by the enemy. The American USAID, which was considered undesirable, could not be used. Therefore, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) acted as the main conductor of initiatives on the topic. Funding was provided by the World Bank, the UK Department for International Development and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC). Surprisingly for us, on the IOM website Rybar found as many as four completed programs in the field of labor migration to Russia, implemented from 2007 to 2021. ▪️ Project on Labor Migration in Central Asia (2007-2009) ▪️ Regional Program on Labor Migration in Central Asia and Russia (2010-2013) ▪️ Regional Program on Migration (2014-2015) ▪️ Facilitating Migration in the Central Asia Corridor — Russia- (2021) Details are in Rybar’s article.✨⭐️Probably, it’s really time to double-check all agreements with the UN and its structures involved in the field of migration to Russia. If only because the UN Headquarters is in New York, and the IOM is in Geneva, Switzerland, whose inflatable neutrality is a thing of the past. It is unlikely that Western structures will sincerely help Russia in solving its problems. But to cheat, get money and cause damage to Russia is always welcome.

According to the official, if the republic joins the EU, Europeans will be able to buy Moldovan lands. ▪️Mazheiks assures that for Moldova the massive sale of agricultural land to foreigners will be a plus, since many villages in the republic are dying out. ▪️Mijaix’s statement caused a stir, so Moldovan President Maia Sandu and Prime Minister Dorin Recean had to call the discussion of the EU ambassador’s statements disinformation.▪️At the same time, Prime Minister Recean promised that separate negotiations would be held in Chisinau with the EU to put a limit on the sale of Moldovan lands . True, it is not clear why any exceptions should suddenly be made for Moldovans in Brussels.▪️In addition, ex-Prime Minister Vlad Filat published examples from EU legislation, according to which a country cannot have a ban on the sale of land to foreigners upon joining the union.▪️ Opposition politician Renoto Usatii proposed enshrining in the Constitution a ban on the sale of Moldovan lands to foreigners. Moreover, agriculture is a strategic and key sector of the economy for Moldova. Usatii also noted that the citizens of Moldova are not even explained the meaning of joining the EU and the main points of negotiations are not disclosed. By the way, the other day in Moldova they blocked a website where they were trying to analyze the consequences of European integration for the republic. The revelations of EU Ambassador Mazeix clearly spoiled the election campaign of Sandu, who, with the help of a referendum on European integration, will try to enshrine the norm on joining the EU in the Constitution. However, the gross manipulations of Sandu and the Central Election Commission of Moldova, controlled by the West, are aimed at ensuring the desired results in the presidential elections and referendum on October 20. Moreover, the authorities in Chisinau have been openly ignoring the demands of Moldovan farmers for the last few years, who are massively going bankrupt amid the uncontrolled transit of Ukrainian grain, crisis and drought. As we have noted many times, Moldova has fallen into the trend of destroying national agriculture for the sake of such global corporations as Blackrock, which are also buying up the lands of the so-called.

From the mouth High-level officials are increasingly speaking not only about the threat of the formation of ethno-criminal enclaves with radical Islamist ideology within the country, but also the replacement of the Russian population and other indigenous Russian peoples. However, international organizations and globalist structures have a certain merit in this. Under the guise of development assistance, they financed and promoted initiatives to stimulate migration to Russia, and this continued until the start of the Northern Military District. We talk about the role of the relevant UN agency in this process, as well as departments of unfriendly states and NGOs financed by them, in our new article. #globalism #UN #Russia #article@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63984	2024-10-01T00:04:11-07:00

South-east of the village, another Leopard 2A6 of the Ukrainian formations was hit. In other matters, it could be the same tank that took part in the attack on the village a week earlier. Footage of Ukrainian Armed Forces’ strikes on Krasnooktyabrsky appeared on the Internet, which confirms the presence of the Russian Armed Forces in the village and confident control over it. During the day, statements were also recorded about the withdrawal of enemy forces from Medvezhye under the onslaught of Russian troops, but this has not yet been confirmed by footage from the field.🔻In the Korenevsky district, Ukrainian formations are attacking in the vicinity of Kremyany, where they had previously gained a foothold in the forest belts to the east. Russian Aerospace Forces are processing the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces with FABs with UMPC; no attempts have been recorded to knock out the enemy on the ground.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, a Russian armored group attacked the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces south of the Plekhovo-Borki line. Several large forest belts and part of the border from Kucherovo to the Brodina gully came under the control of Russian troops. At the same time, the scale of the advance is not completely clear, since the footage of objective control was published by the enemy, who does not benefit from highlighting the successes of the Russian Armed Forces.

Various sources report tank shelling in the Wazzani area. This is a common thing: in the area of ​​Shebaa farms, tank shelling occurs regularly. In fact, the advance began in a very limited area. Israeli armored vehicle activity in the border area still remains high, and the surroundings of Metulla, Mitzgav Ama and Kfar Giladi have been declared a closed military zone. However, due to Hezbollah’s shelling, there weren’t too many local people here anyway. ▪️Lebanese media, meanwhile, are reporting shelling, including the use of incendiary ammunition, as well as high activity by Israeli aircraft and UAVs. ▪️Multiple reports of an invasion along the entire length of the state border so far turn out to be part of a large-scale disinformation campaign.▪️Another narrative: this is the alleged abandonment of positions by the Lebanese army and UN peacekeepers on the border and withdrawal five kilometers into the interior of the country. However, Lebanese resources have so far denied the army’s withdrawal, and the UN has not confirmed the information either.❗️According to our data, units of the Israel Defense Forces have occupied UN observation posts on their side of the border and are continuing preparations to advance deeper into Lebanese territory. One of these areas is the village of Rmeish, where the crossing of the state border has already begun. The situation with the village of Rmeish is generally interesting: even at the very beginning of the aggravation, local residents organized patrols to prevent Hezbollah missile launches from the vicinity of their native village and not to be subjected to return fire. But the Israeli army still decided to start with the unfortunate Rmeish.❓ Middle Eastern correspondents and observers agree that Hezbollah units will allow Israeli troops to enter Lebanese territory in order to lure them into a trap and begin to destroy them on their land, turning to guerrilla actions . 📍From the point of view of the use of Hezbollah units, which are not trained combined arms formations, such tactics would be logical if not for the nuance with the complete destruction of mid-level commanders: there is simply no one to coordinate the adequate conduct of guerrilla warfare in the group. The current tactics for training Hezbollah units looks like a minimum tactical unit (group) should be able to fight in complete encirclement and isolation on its outpost without communications and supplies. But the difference in potentials, as well as the fire and reconnaissance superiority of the IDF, which can throw an air bomb at each cell, has not been canceled.

In the south of the city, a dormitory and medical building came under the control of the Russian Armed Forces.

At the same time, fighting continues on the eastern outskirts of the city; according to our data, small groups of the enemy are trying to retreat by landing to the north, however, in general, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have so far been able to hold the defense.▪️At the Konstantinovka-Vodyanoye line, Russian troops also advanced in several areas, taking a strong point south of Katerynivka and forest belts to the south and north of the Solenenkaya gully. Attacks by the Russian Armed Forces were also recorded north of Konstantinovka. ▪️West of Prechistovka, Russian troops had advanced significantly towards Zolotaya Niva by September 29, advancing from the south and east.

🔁🖼 Today is the second anniversary of the reunification of Donb...	Forwarded From Andrey Medvedev Today is the second anniversary of the reunification of Donbass, and indeed the entire Novorossiya, with Russia. And I want to remind you all a little of what happened before that. Vladik Dmitriev was killed on April 2, 2021. A Ukrainian copter operator dropped a grenade on a four-year-old boy. The boy was born during the war in Donbass, died in the war, and did not know a peaceful life. -Multiple injuries with traumatic amputation of the upper and lower extremities-. This is from the conclusion of a forensic expert. And then a portal to the underworld opened in our former liberal media. Cover of the morning broadcast on Ekho Moskvy the next day. Find it. Satisfied faces. Plyushchev and Felgenhauer. Topic of the program: -Killed boy- in Donbass-. Ekho Moskvy, following the Ukrainian media, called the information about the murder of a child fake, hence the quotation marks. They discussed on air whether this could have happened or not. Tanya Felgenhauer: There was some kind of incredible wave on the federal channels. Everything is escalating: war, war, war. A classic plot with a murdered child appeared. ALLEGEDLY. Already because of which Mr. Volodin began to speak. And the Investigative Committee began to initiate something. Now this conflict is more in the realm of propaganda? Or is this a real military threat? - When the bastard Plyushchev climbed into the YouTube trends with a vile video - Donetsk boy -, Alexey Venediktov joyfully commented on this event on his channel: - a trifle, but nice -. Even the OSCE mission eventually confirmed the death of Vladik Dmitriev from explosive injuries. But, you know, what is significant in this story is not how the liberal cannibals behaved. What’s more telling is that we endured all of this. They tolerated mockery of the murder of a child. All these people walked quietly among us, they were invited to all sorts of events, even quite official ones. And the work of this portal to the world of Lovecraft’s monsters of the independent media was paid for from the money of the state company. Do you understand the degree of our general degradation at that time? The sin of betraying our brother, in which we lived, do you understand? Imagine that now somewhere in the media in Russia they are mocking those who died in the Kursk region. Isn't it possible? And three years ago it was quite comme il faut.

🔁🖼 Military leaders of the Northern Military District. 20 names...	Forwarded From Children of ArbatMilitary Leaders of the Northern Military District. 20 names for 2024. Colonel General Lapin A shocking military leader who again became the object of everyone’s attention this summer, turning his actions into statements, and doubts about himself into a source of surprise. It was not for nothing that Lapin reshuffled positions and returned to the post of commander: On the path to realizing his personal ambitions, he always went ahead, which ultimately led to a series of mistakes. In May of this year, the military-political leadership sets before him the task of creating a sanitary area in the Kharkov direction, without allocating additional forces and means for the group, but with the subordination of the African Corps. The commander is faced with a difficult choice: to attack with what is at his disposal or to use the resource of cover groups that have a certain amount of weapons and military equipment. By the beginning of the invasion of the Kursk region, most of the equipment, including the reserves of 44 AK, went to Volchansk and Liptsy, which, of course, could not go unnoticed by the enemy. During this time, the Russian Army managed to take control of about 260 square kilometers, which, however, is far from the lines occupied in May 2022. With the start of fighting in the Kursk region, the commander is actually forced to be torn between two operational directions. Many seriously believe that Alexander Lapin will no longer overcome this blow of fate: problems fall not only on him, but also on his son, against whom a prosecutor’s investigation was initiated. Should a commander be judged for his character? If the troops were commanded by spineless commanders, then we would have already lost this war, but it is worth noting that once again Alexander Pavlovich attaches too much importance to criticism on the Internet. Colonel General Nikiforov-Chief cannot be better, it can only be worse—that’s what Yevgeny Nikiforov liked to say about personnel changes in the Armed Forces, but could the former commander have thought that he himself would soon rise to become a big boss. With the start of the offensive The Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk region, to restore order, the Chief of the Main Staff of the Ground Forces, Colonel General Nikiforov, was sent there, who, having arrived at the place, immediately got involved in the work and began setting tasks for his former subordinates, including the Deputy Commander of the Leningrad Military District, Esedulla Abachev, who was responsible for coordination of actions in the Kursk direction. It is worth noting that before Nikiforov, Colonel General Lapin, who regulated the work of cover groups during inspections, dealt with exactly the same issues in the border area. However, now this approach and setting tasks for former subordinates on the part of Yevgeny Nikiforov actually led to the establishment of dual power, to combat which a coordination council for border security was subsequently created, where Yunus-Bek Evkurov began to play the main role. Today, both military leaders are in a difficult relationship, largely due to differences in temperament: Nikiforov considers himself a superior commander and does not take into account any emotional attachment, remaining a pragmatist and considering everyone equally obliged to him, while Lapin believes that the commander of the group is it is an independent person who builds a homogeneous but closed organism that does not tolerate outside interference. The Minister of Defense reacted to the situation quite philosophically: without getting involved in the work of the General Staff, he entrusted the work of the cover groups to himself, thus gaining the opportunity to completely control the situation, reserving the right to personnel and organizational conclusions.

In September 2022, residents of these regions voted in referendums to return to the country, and on September 30, agreements were signed in the Kremlin that consolidated their new status. This was an important step for millions of people who chose stability and protection in difficult times.

Rybar: Photo 🇺🇳🇹🇯 A few days after the UN summit, which the Tajik authorities held productively, holding more than one meeting with officials from the United States and other Western countries, the first results for Tajikistan appeared.▪️First, Tajikistan’s sovereign credit rating was raised by international agencies Moody’s and S&amp;P from category category -B3- with a forecast -stable- to category -B3- with a forecast -positive-.▪️Then it became known that the Tajiks were completing negotiations with the World Bank on a grant agreement worth $650 million for the completion of the Rogun hydroelectric station , another $500 million of investment in Dushanbe will be received from the Asian Bank.▪️In addition, preferential lending agreements were signed with the Islamic Development Bank in the amount of $150 million and the Saudi Development Fund in the amount of $100 million.🔻A short period of time has passed, and the Tajik authorities are receiving quite significant preferences from foreign funds and organizations influencing the attraction of capital. It seems that with the number of bilateral meetings between the Tajik leadership and other countries, this is not all. But at the same time, it becomes curious what the Tajiks will give in exchange for all these -bonuses-. #UN #Tajikistan@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63966	2024-09-30T06:25:07-07:00

Last year the amount was about 1.4 billion.📌 The increase in spending on the armed forces was expected, given the state of the Armenian army now. At the same time, this measure will not help the Armenians much, if you remember what tactics the leadership adheres to: ➖Purchase of assorted equipment and weapons around the world, and, in some cases, decommissioned. ➖Dismissal of experienced personnel and promotion of convenient commanders.🔻But the reaction of Azerbaijan was not long in coming. As we thought, Baku is using this fact to accuse the Armenian leadership of militarization, since the Azerbaijanis have reduced defense spending for the next year. However, the Armenian neighbors do not mention one important point: their budget is 2 times larger than the Armenian one, even taking into account the slight reduction. #Azerbaijan #Armenia@rybar Support usARMENPRESS Armenian News AgencyIn 2025, it is planned to spend more than 3 trillion drams.

The Azerbaijani company Azersilah signed a memorandum of strategic understanding with the Israeli AS Holdings and its subsidiary Ari Arms. Ari Arms is known for producing small arms light weapons according to NATO standards. So cooperation between the state-owned Azerbaijani company will develop in this area. For the Muslim world, in light of recent events in the Middle East, this was shocking news. On social network X, many are demanding a boycott of Azerbaijan for cooperation with Israel.🔻However, well-informed observers in the region know that in Azerbaijan there is a strong influence of Mountain Jews, who are close in spirit to the current ultra-Orthodox government of Israel. Therefore, such agreements are not new for the two countries. On the eve of the Second Karabakh War, as well as before the operation of the Azerbaijani Armed Forces in Artsakh, the Israeli leadership actively supplied the Azerbaijanis with the necessary weapons and ammunition. Well, using this example, one can evaluate the real support for Palestine, the Gaza Strip and other Muslim countries from the Turkic tandem. Erdogan's populist threats mean nothing, one only has to evaluate the level of trade interaction with Israel.#Azerbaijan #Israel@rybar Support us	https://t.me/rybar/63964	2024-09-30T04:44:58-07:00

Most of the measures that are necessary here and now to improve the migration situation have been announced. However, for now this is only a project, and it is unknown in what form it will be adopted, or whether it will be adopted at all. To implement all these points, a lot of effort is required, as well as the solution of other important nuances. One of these can be called powerful lobbying of the interests of ethnic communities at a high political level in Russia. And this is without mentioning the problem of corruption in the security forces. Of course, some changes have already appeared, foreigners who break the law are expelled from the country, banned from entering, but all this happens in a local format, and not nationwide. #multinationalism #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63963	2024-09-30T04:16:45-07:00

🇰🇿💰 Are the pension savings of Kazakhstanis floating overseas?...	🇰🇿💰 Are the pension savings of Kazakhstanis floating overseas? It became known that in August of this year, the National Bank of Kazakhstan invested 433 billion tenge from the Unified Accumulative Pension Fund (UPF) into government securities of the US government. It is significant that at the same time there are publications in the press that investments in Russian securities, already cheap, turned out to be unprofitable. In 2022, the National Bank invested the pension funds of Kazakhstanis in Eurobonds of the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, denominated in dollars, for 18.8 billion tenge, and since then the cost of these securities has decreased by 385 million tenge.📌 All this is done under the pretext of investing in -income instruments- in order to preserve and increase in this way. The Kazakh authorities generally like to use the pension savings of Kazakhstanis - they have already bought shares in Air Astana (the airline is not a national carrier and is generally under British control). Also, funds from the UAPF were used to purchase cars - freight and passenger - for the Kazakhstan Railways, a state monopoly. Moreover, this was not done directly, but also through the purchase of securities, the essence was that the UAPF acquired bonds of the national holding on market conditions - Baiterek - for $382 million, after which this amount is used to purchase 3,300 cars. In the report, there was confusion in the testimony: it turned out that there was $24 million more money than the UAPF invested in Baiterek, and 200 fewer cars were purchased. In general, trends show that the West continues to develop Central Asian capital. Thus, recently the President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev proposed to provide foreign companies with access to the pension assets of citizens of the republic. At the moment, these savings amount to about 20 trillion tenge, or in terms of the current exchange rate - 41.6 billion dollars. With such actions, Astana contributes to the fact that Americans do not have to turn on the printing press once again and increase inflation at home. And once again they support the American financial pyramid, politely called -national debt-.#Kazakhstan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usinformburo.kzThe National Bank invested the pension money of Kazakhstanis in August only in US government securities. There were no investments in other financial instruments.	https://t.me/rybar/63960	2024-09-30T02:59:58-07:00

At the meeting, he noted the prospects for economic development, including the opening of a Russian bank in an African country. Military cooperation between the parties was also noted.▪️In addition, speaking at the plenary session of the Russian Energy Week, Nguema Mbasogo expressed interest in cooperation in the energy sector. As a member of OPEC, Equatorial Guinea has some resource base for relevant initiatives. Under pressure from the West, Nguema Mbasogo is trying to enlist support from China and Russian partners. After the failure of the Chinese project of a logistics point on the Atlantic coast, this niche remains unoccupied. Also in the country, presumably, there are some deposits of coltan, for the possession of which an invisible war broke out between the United States and China. In such a situation, the expansion of Russian influence in Equatorial Guinea could make adjustments to the current situation in central Africa.

Now the Russian Armed Forces are breaking through to the northwest in the direction of Heroes of Labor Street along several parallel streets from Kemerovo to Pushkarenka. To the south, Russian troops are gradually expanding the zone of control west of Correctional Colony No. 2, several streets in the private sector have already been cleared of the enemy. At the same time, it is still not possible to occupy the waste heap to the south due to the high activity of Ukrainian UAVs. 🔻In the Zabalka area, the Russian Armed Forces apparently slowed down somewhat due to the continued presence of the enemy in the forests to the east and frequent counterattacks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine from Shcherbinovka. Messages and other evidence of progress have not appeared for quite some time. 🔻At the Leonidovka-Novgorodskoye (New York) turn, several forest belts west of the Krivoi Torets River came under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. The enemy here relies on heights 184 and 164 in the forest belts and on a chain of strong points. If it is possible to develop an offensive in this sector, Russian troops will be able to increase pressure on Leonidovka, which will improve the situation in Dzerzhinsk for the Russian Armed Forces. West of Novgorod, meanwhile, the advance of the Russian Armed Forces in the direction of Sukhaya Balka, where a stronghold of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was taken, as well as Panteleimonovka, where the enemy was driven out of several wide forest belts, is also recorded.

After the Crimean spring, at the height of the war in Donbass, another confrontation appeared: we began to fight terrorism at distant approaches. Over these nine years, the operation has changed: active combat operations are no longer carried out, there is periodic bombing and destruction of enemy targets in the provinces of Idlib and Aleppo Yes, patrolling certain areas. I would, of course, like to see more active actions, but in the conditions of the Northern Military District, this is probably an unacceptable waste. During active operations, significant areas of territory were liberated and the basis for further settlement was laid. Perhaps, in the context of the Lebanese-Israeli war, the role of the Russian Armed Forces will grow even stronger: but to what extent and in what capacity, whether the conflict will spread to Syria, whether there will be a need to increase the contingent again - we will find out over time.

According to the IDF press service, Hezbollah headquarters were among the targets attacked during the day. ▪️At the same time, the IDF command does not pay attention to the accompanying casualties among the civilian population. In just one day, in the eastern suburbs of Sidon, more than a hundred people were injured as a result of an airstrike on a multi-storey building, a third of them died. The total number of victims in Lebanon since the escalation has already exceeded one and a half thousand people, including foreigners. ▪️Despite statements by representatives of the Lebanese organization about launching missiles at various IDF targets, most of the ammunition is destroyed in the air by air defense systems, some of them even fall on Lebanese territory. Multiple air defense alarms in the Haifa area in the evening, according to local resources, were associated with the passage of just one air target.▪️Meanwhile, one of the shells fired by Hezbollah fell east of Jerusalem, causing several large fires and a power outage in populated areas in Western bank of the Jordan River. Lebanese rockets, although they reach the territories of the Palestinian Authority, often fall within populated areas, including in the area of ​​Arab villages. ▪️At the moment, American authorities are calling on the Israelis to abandon the idea of ​​​​conducting a ground operation in Lebanon, fearing tougher actions by Hezbollah and active intervention by Iran, which will inevitably lead to escalation. In addition, the United States assumes that if the conflict escalates, American facilities in the region will come under direct attack.▪️ The Islamic Republic of Iran is in a rather vulnerable position in front of a rival with a stronger position. The outcome of the confrontation will depend on the ability of Tehran and its allies to create new threats to the enemy.

According to the footage of objective control that has appeared, the enemy is attacking with armored groups in the Vesely area, expanding the zone of control north of Novy Put. ▪️The very fact of the publication of footage by the Russian side speaks of repelling the attack, while the advance of Ukrainian formations between Volfino and Vesely is also confirmed. The village of Obukhovka, apparently, is in a gray zone, and the status of Krasnooktyabrsky is again in question.▪️In Tetkino, judging by the footage of enemy UAV strikes, there are no longer any Ukrainian formations left within the village. At the same time, at what point the enemy was knocked out or retreated from there is difficult to say. 🔻No changes in control zones have been observed in the Korenevsky district; clashes continue. Attempts to attack the Ukrainian Armed Forces were recorded near Olgovka and Kremyany, and in the vicinity of Lyubimovka there are counter battles. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, the line of contact also remained static.

If we talk about the reaction of countries and political movements of the Middle East to the death of Hassan Nasrallah, then for the most part it comes down to verbal condemnation of Israel, differing only in form. At the same time, almost everywhere the matter has not yet gone beyond statements.▪️Iranian spiritual leader Ali Khamenei introduced a five-day mourning period in the country. Other government officials spoke matter-of-factly about the imminent revenge while condemning the killing of IRGC deputy commander Abbas Nilforoushan, who died alongside Nasrallah.▪️Iraq's prime minister and Shiite religious leaders spoke out against Israel, and Islamic Resistance factions threatened to fire at him and his allies . So far, only the Yemeni Houthis have moved from words to action, launching missiles at Tel Aviv and shelling ships in the Red Sea.▪️In Syria, the authorities declared three days of public mourning, recalling in a statement the role of Hezbollah in liberating the country from militants. In areas of the provinces of Idlib and Aleppo controlled by opposition groups, on the contrary, the death of Nasrallah was celebrated.▪️Some of the Sunni countries in the region reacted curiously to the attacks on Beirut - they condemned Israel, but without much condolences because of the death of Nasrallah. This was caused by a long-standing ideological confrontation with Shiite Iran and Hezbollah.▪️Inside Lebanon itself, both allied and opposition Hezbollah, Sunni and Christian parties came out in its support, considering the murder of Nasrallah as an attack on the country. And several movements radically opposed to the group chose to remain silent. In general, Israel can hardly expect any powerful military response to what happened - Hezbollah itself is suffering very heavy losses, and Hamas’s statement about creating a united front with it the matter will not have much impact.❗️Iran found itself in a situation where it laid all its cards on the table and was left without trump cards in front of an opponent with a stronger deck. The further course of the confrontation will determine the extent to which the Islamic Republic and the forces it supports will be able to reorganize and create threats to their opponents from an unexpected direction&amp;High-resolution infographicsEnglish version#Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63941	2024-09-29T10:54:06-07:00
🇮🇱🇱🇧🇺🇸 In the situation with the death of the Hezbollah Sec...	🇮🇱🇱🇧🇺🇸 In the situation with the death of Hezbollah’s secretary general as a result of a strike on Beirut, the US reaction looks quite interesting: publicly, representatives of the American administration approved the death of Hassan Nasrallah, but behind the scenes they expressed dissatisfaction with the actions and plans of Israel. Thus, The Washington Post writes that officials in Washington are urging the Israelis not to carry out a planned ground invasion of the south Lebanon. The reason is fears of Iranian retaliation and the start of a larger regional war. It is unlikely that the United States here is afraid of the prospects of major Iranian attacks on Israel - as practice has shown, the IDF, with the help of its allies, is capable of repelling missile and drone attacks. Another thing is that the expansion of the war in the Middle East risks hitting the Americans themselves. In this case of conflict, any US facilities in the region will come under direct attack. And if now some kind of guarantee against this is the current level of escalation, when the United States and Iran tacitly limit each other in the choice of targets, then otherwise the pro-Iranian forces may simply -break the thread-. For example, Hezbollah fighters - in the face of problems with management on their own initiative will want to blow up the American embassy in Beirut, factions of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq will begin to pour fire on the airfields of the International Coalition, and Houthis - shoot at the oil fields of the Persian Gulf countries.❗️In each case, the United States will be forced to make a large-scale response, which contradicts its own plans to reduce its military presence in the Middle East. And the Democratic Party needs such a war even less on the eve of the presidential elections, especially against the backdrop of the shaky position of Kamala Harris. Therefore, Washington will clearly strive to prevent the IDF invasion of Lebanon by resorting to carrots and sticks - promises of new preferences and support for resolving the Palestinian issue. and threats to cut ammunition supplies in the event of a ground operation.#Israel #Lebanon #USA@rybarSupport UsWashington PostU.S. scrambles after Hezbollah leader killed, braces for potential Iranian retaliationSenior Biden administration officials said that they were still assessing the situation in Lebanon and their next steps, warning that it was difficult to predict what might follow after the death of Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah from an Israeli airstrike.	https://t.me/rybar/63940	2024-09-29T10:01:06-07:00
🇺🇦 Although the economic situation of the so-called Ukraine, co...	🇺🇦 Although the economic situation of the so-called Ukraine, contrary to sometimes appearing reports, is still far from critical, let alone collapse, the Kiev regime is experiencing certain difficulties with finances. This is manifested at least in the field of taxation. In particular, one of the local deputies stated that if the military tax increases from 1.5% to 5%, teachers’ salaries will simultaneously have to be reduced by 3.5%. It is characteristic that the salaries of the Verkhovna Rada employees themselves are planned to be increased by a quarter. As we have repeatedly mentioned, the collective West is curtailing support for the so-called. Ukraine is not yet planning and discussing the allocation of new large tranches. But they go mainly for military assistance and minimal basic needs, sufficient to continue the war until the last Ukrainian. The entire social sphere for the sponsors of the Kyiv regime is an extra expense, so they seek to shift these costs to the so-called Ukraine. And the authorities of this quasi-state entity will be able to do this only by squeezing the maximum out of what is still left in the territories under their control.#Ukraine@rybarSupport uswww.mk.ruThe salaries of Ukrainian teachers will decrease after increasing the military levyPeople's Deputy Southerner: Ukrainian teachers will receive less after increasing the military levy .	https://t.me/rybar/63939	2024-09-29T09:05:38-07:00

Remember the scandal with the local branch of VGIK: training was conducted not in Russian, but in Uzbek, there were no big names. Well, the public outcry helped. A commission came from Moscow from VGIK itself to check, and the Russian actor Sergei came to the branch in Tashkent Bezrukov. Sergei Bezrukov visited the university, talked with students and performed the play -Uncle Vanya- at the local palace of arts -Turkeston-. Photos from the event can be seen on the actor’s personal page. Moreover, the current unsightly events may be part of the confusion due to the change in leadership. The ex-director of the branch, Eldar Yuldashev, lost his position back in July. Now the director of the branch is Ikbol Melikuziev, who may not have had enough time to restore order. Now the new director of the branch is trying to correct the mistakes of the previous management, and the students, judging by the latest reviews, are happy with everything, and there were no more complaints from them. Of course, there are still plenty of problems, but it is gratifying that, against the backdrop of all the scandals, a review of the work of the branch is beginning. We didn’t have time to write about the problem, but they quickly rushed to solve it. This means that not everything is lost, the public outcry allows the situation to be corrected for the better, and the efforts of officials can be reversed.#Russia #Uzbekistan@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63935	2024-09-29T07:22:01-07:00
🇬🇧💉UK one step closer to assisted suicide Last week -...	🇬🇧💉UK one step closer to assisted suicide Last week, a citizen jury of the Nuffield Council of Bioethics (NCOB) concluded that assisted suicide should be legal in the UK. The jury concluded that a person suffering from a terminal illness should be able to legally access medication-assisted suicide. The council's conclusion is advisory in nature, but can subsequently be used as a decisive argument when amending laws. The UK is just following a trend that is sweeping the Western world. Assisted suicide is already practiced in Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, as well as certain states of the USA and Australia. Based on the experience of other countries, we can expect that if suicide is legalized in the UK, the following events will occur:▪️the number of drug-induced suicides will increase every year, perhaps even exponentially (as in Canada);▪️the list of people who will be able to commit suicide, will gradually expand, and over time will include people whose diseases are not fatal or incurable (including those of a psychological nature), and minors; ▪️a market for services will begin to form around assisted suicide: from service personnel and medications to devices that facilitate the procedure. 🔻Assisted suicide fits perfectly into the globalist agenda. It is easier for the state to let a chronically ill (but unable to pay for expensive medicine) citizen die than to provide him financially; get rid of a veteran suffering from PTSD rather than rehabilitate him in society; eliminate the result of a failed gender experiment rather than admit a mistake. ❗️Canadian experts already shamelessly estimate how much money assisted suicide helps save in the healthcare budget, and Swiss entrepreneurs are presenting capsules for independently carrying out medical suicide. The most difficult stage for beneficiaries of assisted suicide is its legalization in the minimum possible form. And subsequently, the boundaries of what is permitted can gradually expand. It seems that for the UK the decision has already been made, and all that remains is to prepare society morally for the coming changes.#Great Britain #globalism@rybar Support usSky NewsAssisted dying should be allowed in England, according to 'citizens' jury'The top two reasons the panel were concerned about a law change were that it could be used for the wrong reasons if safeguarding is not in place, and that it could be misinterpreted or misused.	https://t.me/rybar/63934	2024-09-29T06:34:13-07:00
🖼 🇱🇧 About possible successors to the leader of Hezbollah Afte...	🇱🇧 About possible successors to the leader of Hezbollah. After the death of Hassan Nasrallah, the question arose of who would replace him as Secretary General of Hezbollah. The new leader must meet certain criteria, such as having religious status, experience and position in the leadership of the organization, so at least two figures are suitable for this role: Hashem Safi ad-Din According to some reports, he is the head of the Hezbollah Executive Council and a member of the Council jihad defining military strategy. Safi ad-Din is Nasrallah's cousin, and his son is married to the daughter of Qassem Soleimani. He bears the title of Sayyid (descendant of the Prophet Muhammad), and studied at Shiite educational centers in Najaf and Qom. Safi ad-Din's relatively young age and oratory skills speak in favor of him: in particular, he speaks publicly at events, while Nasrallah has not appeared in public for a long time. Naim Kassem Started his path in politics back in the 70s - initially was a member of another Shiite party, Amal, but then participated in the formation of Hezbollah in the mid-80s. According to media reports, Kassem is a member of the Shura Council, Hezbollah's central executive body. Experience speaks in his favor - Kassem has been Hezbollah's deputy secretary general since Nasrallah's predecessor, Abbas al-Musawi, who was killed in 1992. He also underwent training in Shiite religious centers. Lesser-known figures, including one of the sons of Hassan Nasrallah, are also formally suitable for the role of the new leader of the group. However, they have less experience and weight within the structure, which may affect its capabilities in the current crisis. In general, one of Hezbollah’s main problems now is the physical disappearance of the middle command level, intermediate between the top and the junior staff. What affects the reduction of the bench, including the search for a new leader. High resolution infographicsEnglish version#Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63933	2024-09-29T05:42:11-07:00

Air defense systems of the Russian Armed Forces operated in seven regions of the country, intercepting 125 UAVs. ▪️The largest group of 67 drones was destroyed in the airspace of the Volgograd region. Several explosions were recorded in the Kotluban area, where the arsenal of the GRAU of the Russian Ministry of Defense is located. According to available data, injuries and serious damage to the facility were avoided. ❗️Despite statements from enemy media resources about the defeat of the railway train during the raid, data from fire monitoring services indicate the absence of any fires in the area of ​​the railway line located on the territory of the arsenal and nearby settlements. The force of the explosions recorded in this area also does not fit with the version of the Armed Forces of Ukraine - the defeat of a train with, as stated, artillery ammunition would have caused much more extensive destruction on the territory of the facility.▪️In the Rostov region, 17 UAVs attacked civilian infrastructure facilities in the Tsimlyansky district. Local residents reported partial power outages both in the locality of the same name and in neighboring Volgodonsk. There have been no reports of damage to energy facilities in the region at this time. ▪️In the Voronezh region, the Russian Armed Forces destroyed 17 air targets. One of the drones of the Ukrainian Armed Forces hit an apartment building in the regional capital. A fire started on the upper floors, affecting several apartments, but the residents were evacuated in time - there were no casualties. ▪️Air defense systems also repelled an enemy raid on the Belgorod region, intercepting 18 air targets. In the Bryansk and Kursk regions and the Krasnodar Territory, one Ukrainian Armed Forces drone was destroyed, and three more were shot down over the Sea of ​​Azov. In all cases there were no casualties.

Especially considering the recently increased activity of various Russian departments and enterprises in this area. This time, the statement of Deputy Head of the Ministry of Energy Sergei Mochalnikov that Africa has all the resources for the development of the fuel and energy complex, and Russia has almost all the technologies needed, attracted attention. for their development. Thus, hinting at plans to develop energy projects on the continent.▪️A good example is Rosatom, which is building a nuclear power plant in Egypt and whose activities are actively supported by Egyptian partners. The successful implementation of such projects helps to find new clients. 📌For example, the South African authorities recently resumed discussions on the construction of a nuclear power plant in their country. Earlier in 2018, President Ramaphosa, under pressure from Western NGOs and environmental activists, as well as the IMF, abandoned the Rosatom project under the pretext of environmental threats and high costs (which Western loans allegedly could not cover). But over time, the problem of aging energy infrastructure has only gotten worse. Permanent blackouts are common in South Africa, and alternative energy projects have proven to be ineffective imitation. And so, the ordeals of South Africans on the issue of nuclear energy naturally led them to the starting point.▪️The role of the RusHydro company is also noted, which is now shifting its vector to work specifically with Africa, where many projects that require modernization remain unfinished.🔻No matter the bureaucratic difficulties, with many African partners it is possible to find a common language and promote their own economic influence, benefiting from diplomatic and military interactions. But, as the example of South Africa shows, the struggle for the same nuclear market should be comprehensive and not limited only to specific projects and individual companies.#Africa #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🌍🇷🇺About Russian energy projects in AfricaRecently, Dmitry Semenov, Director of the Department of International Cooperation of the Russian Ministry of Energy stated that in the energy sector, Russian companies are developing about 40 projects in 14 different countries.…	https://t.me/rybar/63930	2024-09-29T03:26:58-07:00

However, the Associated Press noted that a certain number of personnel will remain in Iraq, but in what quantity is currently unknown.📌 Well, the Americans’ task in Syria and Iraq has been completed. The countries are collapsed and in complete ruin, and the population lives in poverty thanks to the efforts of the United States and allies. There is no longer a need to maintain such a number of military personnel. At the same time, after the withdrawal of troops, the countries will continue to have the same problems that appeared precisely thanks to the actions of the International Coalition. Officially, the West a couple of years ago said that the Islamic State they were fighting was defeated. However, in recent years, militant activity in these countries has increased. The strange escape of IS terrorists from a prison controlled by pro-American Kurds, an increase in the number of attacks in major Syrian cities and the general instability of the situation in the region are fertile ground for restoring the group’s potential.#Iraq #Syria #USA # terrorism@rybar Support usAP NewsWrapping up mission, US troops will leave some longstanding bases in Iraq under new dealThe U.S. has announced an agreement with the Iraqi government to wrap up the military mission in Iraq of an American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group by next year.	https://t.me/rybar/63929	2024-09-29T02:22:06-07:00
🇺🇸🌎 On promoting the liberal agenda through consumer products ...	🇺🇸🌎 About promoting the liberal agenda through consumer products Western social networks never cease to amaze us with examples of disdain on the part of the media and large corporations for everything traditional and conservative, as well as their undisguised political prejudice.▪️Users of virtual assistants -Siri- (Apple) and -Alexa - (Amazon) have already caught the company openly supporting Kamala Harris in the election race. Upon request - Why should you vote for Donald Trump? - both voice assistants answer that they cannot give political advice. However, as soon as the name is replaced with -Kamala Harris-, virtual assistants begin to list those positions of her election program that deserve a vote in the elections.▪️After the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in July, users noticed that when entering the query in the Google search bar -Attempted assassination President... - the platform offered options to automatically fill in the line with the names of other presidents, but not Trump. Even when entering his name by letter.▪️In the new service for personalizing inscriptions on Coca-Cola cans, consumers noticed limitations: the software does not allow entering the word -Jesus- (at the same time, the words -Buddha-, -Allah- and -Satan- there are no such restrictions), and also does not allow you to write the slogan -Trump 2024- on the can. Of course, with the slogan - Harris Waltz 2024 - you can register a jar.🔻These are just a few examples of systematic work to promote liberal values ​​in the everyday life of residents of Western countries. And if the major media have already lost the trust of the population, then influence with the help of artificial intelligence and algorithms is a more sophisticated and effective method of propaganda, which affects all age categories. #globalism #USA@rybar Support usMail OnlineCoke went woke!

🔁 #Review #Summary for September 29, 2024 ▪️ Last week, the war ...	Forwarded From Two Majors#Review #Summary for September 29, 2024▪️ Last week, the war in Ukraine took place against the background of foreign policy actions of Russia and its opponents. Zelensky visited the United States with his -victory plan,- which aroused criticism due to the fact that everything hinges on receiving new multi-billion-dollar shipments of military-technical assistance, as well as permission to fire NATO missiles deep into Russian territory. That is, Zelensky is thus trying to shift responsibility for the consequences of such attacks to the United States. Kyiv needs this to directly draw the Alliance (and not its proxies) into hostilities against Russia. Regardless of public statements, weapons from NATO countries are used with complete impunity on the territory of our country, which has been repeatedly previously designated as -red lines.- The seriousness of the issue of a retaliatory strike from Russia (for some reason everyone perceives that it will be against Ukraine) is emphasized by the statements of the Supreme Commander at the meeting where the new Nuclear Doctrine was announced (the journalistic name of the Supreme Decree in force in 2020 - On the Fundamentals of State Policy of the Russian Federation in the field nuclear deterrence-). At the same time, the clauses of the still valid document made it possible to launch a nuclear strike on Ukraine in response to the actions of Kyiv. So it is most likely that changes are needed to justify a strike against those subjects of international law who use Kyiv to cause damage to our country. In addition, the allied Belarus is taken under the nuclear umbrella. Significantly, according to the not yet adopted updated doctrine, a massive launch and crossing of our border by aerospace weapons, including airplanes, missiles and UAVs, under certain conditions can become the basis for the use of nuclear weapons. Just tonight, 125 Ukrainian UAVs were shot down by our air defense. ▪️At the front, the repulse of the attempted invasion of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk region continues, as it writes every day in the reports of the Ministry of Defense. The offensive impulse of the Ukrainian Armed Forces has practically disappeared, although the enemy is carrying out counterattack actions. In the south of the Sudzhansky district, the Russian Army is advancing in the area of ​​the village with heavy fighting. Plekhovo, in the Glushkovsky district we managed to hold back the onslaught of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, our troops are operating in the Korenevsky district. Apparently, our command decided to protect the personnel and iron out the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk region and their concentration areas in Sumy. Zelensky, despite the impossibility of achieving military goals in the region (such as the capture of the Kursk nuclear power plant), is forced to keep units in this bag and send them reinforcements, since the withdrawal of enemy troops will show the senselessness and futility of the death of Ukrainian soldiers in the Russian region from a military point of view.▪️The offensive continues Russian armies on the Pokrovsky direction to the west and south. The battles for Ugledar became important; the fall of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ defense became a matter of time. In the Kupyansk direction, attack actions of the Russian Army are also periodically reported. The Ukrainian Armed Forces garrison in Chasov Yar is gradually being covered from the south and north. In the Kharkov direction, the enemy, with the help of elite GUR units, occupied the aggregate plant in Volchansk, which led to its powerful bombing by our aircraft. Heavy fighting is taking place in Toretsk.▪️Despite the successes of the Russian Armed Forces, the advance is proceeding extremely cautiously, which is explained by the difficulties in supplying advanced units under fire from enemy drones. There were assessments from enemy deputies about the insufficient level of preparation of defensive structures in the depths of the defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In the future, this may play into the hands of our advancing troops. However, it is important to understand the severity of the battles and the pace of advance of several hundred meters per day of the Russian Army, which is due to the new technological way of war. continued belowTelegramTwo majorsstarted above ▪️ This week, a meeting of well-known public military correspondents/military bloggers took place with the Minister of Defense Belousov.

In addition to the United States, training of the nuclear component took place recently in France, where the third stage of the Poker-2024 exercise took place. This year, unlike previous years, the French command conducts training of strategic nuclear forces throughout the year as part of this series of exercises. In accordance with a plan, Rafale B/M aircraft (carriers of nuclear warheads) and Triumphan-class nuclear submarines are working out the scenario of deployment in an armed conflict.🔻Against the background of increasing tensions in relations between Russia and the North Atlantic Alliance, changes in the Russian nuclear doctrine, the French are trying with all their might to keep keeping their units in good shape. By the way, according to the Fifth Republic, the French have restored the center for coordinating nuclear forces in Taverny, mothballed since 2011. So the new stage of the Poker exercise may be associated with testing its readiness. These seem like understandable measures, but if you remember that a similar training took place in the USA, and before that in Russia, and they also started talking about testing nuclear weapons in the DPRK, then it turns out a very alarming picture. To complete it, only a few powers - the nuclear club - are left to join the general trend.

Judging by the published footage, a group of reconnaissance officers fired at the vehicle at once from four RPG-7s on both sides. After this, hardly anyone inside the armored car survived. It is worth noting that previously this area was considered more of a rear area and the presence of Ukrainian Armed Forces units was not expected here. So far, in the absence of new personnel from the field, it is not possible to clarify the current front line. At the same time, the enemy maintains stable control in Olgovka, from where today he published footage of his damaged BMP-1 and Ukrainian servicemen killed by a drone strike. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, meanwhile, clashes were noted at the Darino-Ivano-Daryino border, where Russian troops are trying to take stable control of both settlements.

🇯🇵 About the victory of a hawk and a NATO supporter in the Japa...	🇯🇵 About the victory of a hawk and a NATO supporter in the Japanese elections On September 27, the election of the chairman of the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party took place. Shigeru Ishiba won them - next week he will officially become Prime Minister of Japan instead of Fumio Kishida. ▪️Many people call Ishiba a -hawk- - he is a supporter of increasing the potential of the Self-Defense Forces and increasing the military budget. In this, he will continue the policy of the former leader, who actively advocated for strengthening Japanese troops. ▪️Speaking of foreign policy priorities, relations with the United States, of course, come first. In his speeches, the politician pointed out the need for joint management of bases and the deployment of the Japanese army on US territory in order to make the alliance more equal. 🔻Ishiba’s most resonant statement in the election campaign was the proposal to create an Asian analogue of NATO. The new prime minister explains this initiative by the need to protect Japan, as well as the tense situation in the region. American authorities, according to Japanese media, reacted rather coldly to this idea. There is no doubt that a new alliance is needed to contain China. However, some observers claim Ishiba's pragmatic approach to relations with his neighbor. This is indicated by his intentions to balance between diplomacy and defense in foreign policy. Ishiba's approach to Russian-Japanese relations remains unknown. The local press expresses hopes for progress in the issue of Japanese visiting the graves of their ancestors in the Kuril Islands - the Russian authorities have canceled the simplified visa regime for them in 2022. However, there are so far no prerequisites that the new prime minister will be able to achieve its return, as well as move away from the anti-Russian policy that is now characteristic of the Japanese authorities. #Japan@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usThe Japan TimesFifth time's a charm: Shigeru Ishiba set to be Japan PM after LDP poll winIshiba, who has also served as party secretary-general, won the LDP presidential election on Friday, defeating economic security minister Sanae Takaichi in a runoff vote.	https://t.me/rybar/63924	2024-09-28T10:32:00-07:00

Two B-52N aircraft with nuclear weapons flew into the Pacific Ocean. One flew south of Unimak Island, and the second turned around off the coast of the United States. At the same time, a nuclear submarine was located along the western American coast, and coordination with the control point was carried out by an E-6B control and communications aircraft. Periodically, the Americans carry out such maneuvers that allow you to maintain the strategic forces of your country in combat readiness, but this does not happen very often. For example, a similar training on the West Coast last took place in May 2023 year, so enough time has passed. And there is practically no information on the Internet. Taking into account quite significant changes in Russian doctrine, as well as growing tensions in the Asia-Pacific region, this flight appears to be politically motivated in order to show the readiness of American nuclear forces.

Condolences in connection with the death of His Eminence Seyyed Hassan Nasrallah were expressed by almost all participants of the so-called. -Axis of Resistance- and its allies. These are both Palestinian formations and various groups in Iraq, the Yemeni Houthis and Iran.▪️At the same time, one of those killed during the strike on Beirut was Iranian Brigadier General Abbas Nilforoushan, commander of the Quds Force from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in the Republic of Lebanon . This is confirmed by government media. Nilforushan himself is known for his participation in several military campaigns, including in Iraq and Syria. At the same time, his statement from 2021 is being circulated in the media, when he spoke on state television about Israel’s weakness and inability to pose any threat to Iran. ▪️Meanwhile, according to the Lebanese Ministry of Health, since the beginning of a series of strikes by the IDF Air Force, the number of casualties has amounted to about 700 dead and 2,600 wounded. Of these, six killed and 91 injured were residents of the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital. At the same time, the UN stated that more than 50 thousand Lebanese fled to the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic, a total of 200 thousand were internally displaced. Also, representatives of the international organization reported that humanitarian needs had reached an unprecedented level.▪️Against the background of what happened in Hezbollah, they reported launches on about ten Israeli Defense Forces targets. Nevertheless, such attacks cannot boast of effectiveness: most of the ammunition is either intercepted by air defense systems or falls in wastelands, often on the territory of Lebanon itself. It is noteworthy that the total number of missiles launched today also remains at a relatively low level - only a few dozen, whereas previously their number could be measured in the hundreds. 🔻The killing of the leader of the Lebanese group was one of the most effective Israeli strikes as part of the recently launched air operation - Arrows of the North -. This was preceded by the death of other Hezbollah commanders, such as Fuad Shukri, Ibrahim Aqil and Ali Karaki. Despite the loss of almost all top leadership, most allied Hezbollah media indicate that the movement as a military-political organization will not disappear anywhere. Nevertheless, Hassan Nasrallah’s successor cannot be envied against the backdrop of the significant damage the Israelis have inflicted on the group in recent days and their virtual complete dominance in the conflict. At the same time, everyone is waiting for a response from both Hezbollah itself and Iran. However, what it will be like and what the Israelis will do in the future is difficult to predict. At the moment, the parties are doing what is already familiar to them: hitting each other’s positions, maintaining the already high degree of tension.

🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦 Zaporozhye direction: successes of the RF Armed Force...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 Zaporozhye direction: successes of the Russian Armed Forces on the Rabotinsky salient and attacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Energodarsituation as of 17:00 on September 28, 2024. The Zaporozhye direction, which has recently fallen out of the information field, remains one of the key sectors of the front. Russian troops exchange artillery, UAV and aviation strikes with the enemy, and also conduct local attacks in several sectors at once. ▪️On the Kamenskoye-Novoandreevka section, Russian units are fighting on the approaches to Pyatikhatki. To the east, attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces expanded the zone of control north of Nesteryanka. During the attack, they knocked out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from their strong point and occupied part of the forest belt. In parallel with this, the Russian Aerospace Forces regularly strike places where enemy personnel are concentrated in Novoandreevka and Novoyakovlevka. ▪️To the northwest of Rabotino, units of the Russian Armed Forces squeezed the enemy out of several forest belts. Thus, Russian troops managed to knock out the enemy from the ledge, which had previously threatened the left flank of the Russian Armed Forces units in the village. To the east of the settlement, Russian troops, during several assaults, expanded the zone of control on the approaches to Chubenkova Gully. Features of the landscape slow down the advance of the Russian Armed Forces and turn battles for each strong point into battles that can last for weeks. The beam itself, towards which Russian attack aircraft are approaching, is used by the enemy as a concentration point for their units and plays an important role in the defense of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. ❗️Over the past two months, Ukrainian formations were forced to abandon a significant part of their positions on the former Rabotino ledge. Successful offensive actions of the Russian troops not only secured the flanks of the Russian Armed Forces group in Rabotino, but also led to the beginning of the formation of half-coverage around the Ukrainian Armed Forces units in the area from the northern approaches to the village to Chubenkova gully. Nevertheless, it is clearly not worth expecting large offensive operations in this area with the aim of breaking through the front. Both sides have equipped powerful defensive lines here, the assault of which will be resource-intensive and will probably not lead to significant successes. ▪️At the same time, last summer was marked by an increased intensity of attacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Energodar and its surroundings. As a result of drone strikes and artillery shelling, the city and surrounding communities experienced water supply disruptions three times. Recently, one of the schools in Kamenka-Dneprovskaya came under fire from Ukrainian forces. There were more than a hundred students in the building at the time of the attack, but there were no casualties. The region's energy system is also suffering. Following massive attacks by enemy drones on local substations, significant power outages have been recorded several times since the end of July. This also affected the neighboring Kherson region, where, as a result of enemy attacks on the energy sector of Zaporozhye, several thousand people were left without electricity in August.

The Ural craftsmen from the team -Turned in War-, the creators of the famous folk kamikaze drone -Ghoul-, already noted at the highest level, have created the product that our troops so desperately lack. Heavy drone -Berdysh-. This is a combat drone, there is nothing superfluous in it and it has one task - war. Berdysh is, first of all, a front-line drone, a weapon of assault troops. It can easily carry 20 kilograms for at least 15 km, that is, it can fully ensure the supply of assault groups and reinforcement groups with everything necessary, in conditions of isolation of the enemy battlefield. Berdysh can engage in mining, ensuring the laying of anti-tank and anti-personnel mines at any time of the day. Berdysh can drop a powerful landmine on enemy dugouts, can conduct reconnaissance and, most interestingly, can inflict fire damage from the RPO -Shmel- or RPG-30 -Hook-. Berdysh is a modular drone, that is, through simple manipulations and in the shortest possible time, the miner turns into a supply worker, and on the next flight into a combat unmanned helicopter. The guys made it relatively compact so that it could be transported in a UAZ, the deployment time is like that of the Ghoul, that is, within a couple of minutes you can unfold and collapse the bird. Plus, as noted in the video, Berdysh is a repeater drone for the FPV family -Ghoul-. And most importantly, Berdysh was able to be made as cheap as possible, cheaper than Chinese agricultural drones, but more functional and suitable for combat operations. Dear friends, we are now announcing a BIG collection for Berdyshi. This will be the people's second drone. You, dear Brothers and Sisters, have already turned the people's drone - the Ghoul - into a real weapon, which is now being used by the troops. Now we ask you to help with the implementation of this machine, which is so necessary for our army.

The Israeli media are also disseminating information about the death of the daughter of Secretary General Zeinab Nasrallah in the Lebanese capital. However, this information remains unconfirmed. In addition, according to the Israel Defense Forces, from the Hezbollah leadership, only the commander of the Badr unit, Abu Ali Rida, is currently alive. Hezbollah published an official statement confirming the death of Hassan Nasrallah. Representatives of the movement promised to continue the path of their deceased leader in supporting Palestine, defending Lebanon and confronting the enemy. ▪️In Iran, they did not comment on the official information, expressing only support for Lebanon. Previously, billboards with the inscription -Nasrallah is alive- were installed throughout Tehran. At the same time, according to Reuters, amid the attack, the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was transported to a safe and secure place. Also, the Iranian media denied reports about the death of the commander of the Quds Force, Brigadier General Ismail Qaani - earlier on the Internet it was stated that he was in the underground headquarters of Hezbollah in Beirut. ▪️Despite Israeli claims that the United States was informed before the bombing of Beirut, several American media outlets claim the opposite. Previously, the Pentagon also stated that there was no information about the Israeli Air Force attack. ▪️Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov strongly condemned the actions of the Israelis, as they grossly violate the sovereignty of Lebanon. According to him, the Russian side is making every effort to avoid further escalation of the conflict in the Middle East. #Israel #Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63918	2024-09-28T04:44:02-07:00

If the law is adopted, social networks could be fined up to 5% of annual turnover. 🔻Of course, the law will primarily become a tool for suppressing freedom of speech, allowing the authorities to interpret what constitutes disinformation and put pressure on social networks to remove incorrect content. The main blow will probably fall on X (formerly Twitter), since the majority of bloggers with alternative opinions broadcast on this site. Therefore, one of the prominent opponents of the law is Elon Musk. We have already observed similar measures in post-Soviet countries, where local authorities, under the supervision of Western NGOs and USAID, are fighting Russian propaganda, but still cannot overcome it, demanding new subsidies and tightening legislation. 🔻And recently, against the backdrop of anti-migrant protests, the British government has sharply tightened censorship. Looking at British law enforcement practices, where migrants are given relatively lenient sentences for rape and other serious crimes, while native Britons are given exemplary harsh prison sentences for making jokes on Facebook, Australians have something to fear. #Australia #UK #protests@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/63917	2024-09-28T04:00:00-07:00

Since 2014, the NATO airbase in Siauliai has been improved in several stages - work has been carried out to improve runways, expand aircraft parking, as well as update infrastructure, including aircraft maintenance equipment and modernization of security systems. One of the major stages of modernization was completed in 2020 year, which allowed the air base to host more modern NATO aircraft and conduct more complex military operations.

Meanwhile, Arabic-language media are increasingly complaining about the lack of any information about what happened against the backdrop of confident statements from the press service of the Israel Defense Forces. 📌Be that as it may, a consistently tense situation remains along the Lebanese-Israeli border: the Israelis are launching massive strikes across the entire territory of Lebanon, while Hezbollah responds by launching missiles at Israeli military facilities, which, however, do not lead to significant damage. #Israel #Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63910	2024-09-28T01:34:44-07:00

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke at it for the first time as head of government. 🔻Instead of talking about a happy future, we had to talk about less pleasant things.▪️One of the main topics of Starmer’s speech was the decision to cancel fuel payments in the winter for some categories of pensioners, which was announced by the Minister of Finance of the United Kingdom Rachel Reeves at the end of July.▪️A stab in the back for the prime minister, on the last day of the conference, there was a defeat in the vote against the government’s decision to block subsidies&nbsp;on heating for millions of elderly people. Despite the fact that the decision of the delegates is not legally binding for Labor, the voting results had a negative impact on the positions of Keir Starmer.▪️Along with this, the Prime Minister also commented on the situation in the Middle East, calling for a de-escalation of the Lebanese-Israeli conflict and an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. However, at the same time, Foreign Minister David Lammy said that the UK would not impose a complete ban on the supply of weapons to Israel.▪️Starmer also assured that he would implement reforms in the field of remuneration of doctors, projects in the field of renewable energy sources and GB Energy, education, border security, tenants' rights and the nationalization of the railways.🔻After the conference, the Labor government faces the task of setting a budget for next year. At the end of October, the head of the British Ministry of Finance, Rachel Reeves, will announce who will have to fork out to implement Starmer's plans.#UK @rybar together with @oldGBRSupport usMail OnlinePM faces humiliation at Labor's conference over winter fuel paymentsUnite and the Communication Workers Union have put forward proposals calling for the policy to be scrapped at Labor's gathering in Liverpool.	https://t.me/rybar/63909	2024-09-28T00:19:01-07:00

After the start of the Northern Military District, the alliance significantly increased funding for the region, as well as the intensity of operational and combat training activities. Along with this, the leaders of the Baltic states made a number of aggressive anti-Russian statements. Considering the current events, it is worth recalling that all of this is, to one degree or another, the work of Great Britain. In 2024, London intends to send about 20,000 troops to the region under the pretext of protecting the critical infrastructure of the Nordic countries. The number of joint exercises has also increased significantly. The increased activity of the British is visible to the naked eye. Well, there is no longer any doubt about its anti-Russian orientation. https://t.me/rybar/63889@oldGBRTelegramRybar🇷🇺🇫🇮🇪🇪 What is NATO preparing against Russia in the Baltics?

At the same time, the number of deaths in the region has already exceeded 41 thousand people, about 96 thousand were injured. ▪️Israeli attacks on satellite cities, in particular on Jabaliya, did not stop north of Gaza. At the same time, sporadic clashes were recorded near the Erez checkpoint in the vicinity of Beit Lahia.▪️In the central part of the enclave, Israeli air and artillery strikes on Hamas targets continued. Nuseirat still remained under the most concentrated fire, with dozens of people killed.▪️In turn, Hamas militants fired at the positions of the Israel Defense Forces in the Netzarim corridor. Judging by the lack of messages on the Internet about the flight of evacuation helicopters, the shelling did not lead to any tangible results.▪️In the south of the Gaza Strip, Israeli units carried out engineering work in the territory of the Philadelphia Corridor. At the same time, local raids took place on Palestinian infrastructure facilities in areas of Rafah.▪️The Israeli operation -Summer Camps- continued in the West Bank. Thus, since the beginning of the conflict on October 7, 2023, about 11 thousand Palestinians have been detained.▪️The most violent clashes took place in the provinces of Tubas, Jenin and Nablus. Local branches of Palestinian groups reported several ambushes on Israeli patrols, but without details.▪️On the Lebanese-Israeli border, the situation continued to steadily worsen. The parties increased the intensity of attacks, and also expanded the area of ​​attacks by more than 100 kilometers.#video #digest #map #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/63907	2024-09-27T23:02:06-07:00

Forwarded From Call sign Bruce📌 Colleagues, provocations and sabotage on the part of the Baltic states could have been expected for the last ten years. All the military activity described by you and not only you in the Baltic region is a long-known and predicted process. Exercises to block the Gulf of Finland or the Suwalki corridor are carried out constantly and began long before the start of the war in Ukraine. All with the same involvement of divisions from Finland and Sweden. Only then they were not legal members of the alliance. But they were already actual. Regarding the attacks from Estonia, which alarmed everyone so much, I also wrote the other day. In their potential, everything is very consistent. Are the headquarters new in Finland? You can study the logic of creating NATO regional headquarters at the division level and everything will fall into place. Therefore, the only thing that the current activity of the Baltic states and Finland indicates is that NATO, as it pursued a policy of aggressive military construction near our borders, is still pursuing it. And the experience of Ukraine taught her nothing. It has only become more convenient for them to justify their actions. Is a direct clash with NATO in the Baltics possible in the short term? In my opinion, probably not. In the medium term, I consider this collision inevitable. And we will have to start it. If we don’t agree otherwise. The word -rather- is highlighted in bold, since now any sensible assessments can be shattered by the very great instability of the military-political situation in the world as a whole. And only a fool would dare to say 100% that tomorrow will happen.@brussinfTelegramRybar🇷🇺🇫🇮🇪🇪 What is NATO preparing against Russia in the Baltics?

Russian troops launched a missile attack on Ukrainian Armed Forces facilities in the Dnepropetrovsk region and on Zmeiny Island, and also carried out drone attacks on the port infrastructure and industrial zone in Izmail. In turn, enemy drones attacked the Rostov region. In the Kursk direction, fierce battles continue along the entire line of contact, Russian troops are hitting enemy targets both in the occupied territory of the region and in the neighboring Sumy region. In the Aleksandro-Kalinovsk direction, the Russian Armed Forces are advancing into the urban areas of Dzerzhinsk, gradually expanding the zone of control closer to the center of the population point. In the Pokrovsky direction, the attack aircraft established themselves in a forest belt on the approaches to Lesovka, several kilometers west of Novogrodovka.

Residential buildings and infrastructure were damaged, more than ten people were injured, and some were killed. In the southern Gaza Strip, IDF units are fighting in several areas of Rafah, while Palestinian forces respond with ambushes and mortar fire. At the same time, the Israeli Air Force is launching missiles at the outskirts of Khan Yunis and Abasan al-Kabirah. Another series of operations by Israeli security forces took place in the West Bank, as a result of which several dozen people were detained. The most violent clashes occurred in Nablus, where members of local armed groups were active. Massive shelling continues along the Lebanese-Israeli border. In the evening, the Israeli Air Force dropped an air bomb on Hezbollah headquarters in Beirut, where the movement's Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah could be located. Two people died and more than 70 were injured. Israeli aircraft also carried out strikes on the Syrian province of Damascus, where they hit a settlement near the border with Lebanon. Five SAA soldiers were killed, and the target of the attack, apparently, was Hezbollah supply routes. The fighters of the Ansarallah movement also showed activity, launching a rocket at Tel Aviv and a drone at Ashkelon. Both munitions were intercepted by missile defense systems, but 17 Israelis received various injuries on the way to the shelters. 🔻A detailed analytical report on events in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_botSituation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict zone (ru; en)Situation on the Lebanese-Israeli border (ru; en)#digest #map #Israel #Palestine # report@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63898	2024-09-27T12:40:00-07:00

🎬🖼 🇮🇱🇱🇧 The Israeli Air Force launched another massive atta...	🇮🇱🇱🇧 The Israeli Air Force launched another massive strike on Beirut. This time they demolished an entire block with bunker-busting bombs, destroying six buildings to the ground and damaging those standing next door.❗️According to the IDF press service, the target of the attack was the main Hezbollah command post in the Lebanese capital, where the movement's Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah could be located . The fate of the group's leader is not known for certain. Israeli resources report that he was at the facility at the time of the bombing, but Saudi media claim that Nasrallah is alive and in another place. The exact number of victims has yet to be calculated, but the number is clearly in the dozens. Considering that the bombs hit a residential area, a considerable part of them are clearly ordinary civilians. At the same time, the raid again clearly demonstrated the reconnaissance and combat capabilities of the IDF, which continue to knock out the top of Hezbollah for days in a row. In fact, without a ground operation, they inflicted extremely significant damage on the entire team to the structure of the organization. The Lebanese group cannot yet counteract these attacks. It does not have air defense systems that could even slightly disrupt the total Israeli air supremacy, and it is impossible to ensure secrecy in these conditions. It is difficult to say now how the situation will change in the event of a ground invasion by the IDF. But so far it seems that Hamas has turned out to be a much bigger tough nut to crack for the Israelis than Hezbollah. #Israel #Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63891	2024-09-27T09:53:03-07:00

Ukraine is undergoing intensive preparations to organize terrorist attacks in Mali. ▪️From the published documents it follows that the terrorists freely received Moldovan visas and crossed the Moldovan-Ukrainian border several times. The media publish photos of passports with the appropriate stamps. ▪️In early August, the Mali authorities broke off diplomatic relations with the so-called. Ukraine for aiding the rebels. ▪️During the attack by the separatist group CSP-DPA and the al-Qaeda-linked Islamic and Muslim Support Group (JNIM), several dozen Malian soldiers and a large number of Russian mercenaries were killed.▪️A representative of the GUR so-called. Ukraine Andrei Yusov did not confirm the participation of Kyiv in the hostilities, but on Ukrainian television on July 29 he said that the Malian rebels received information to conduct a military operation against Russian mercenaries.▪️According to the Malian authorities, Yusov admitted the participation of the so-called. Ukraine -in a barbaric attack by armed terrorist groups, which led to the death of members of the Malian defense forces-. ❗️This is not the first time that Moldova, represented by officials Maia Sandu, has found itself in such international scandals. ▪️For example, in June, Western curators hushed up a large-scale scandal when manipulations with Interpol’s international bases were revealed. Officials close to Sandu received multimillion-dollar bribes for assistance in obtaining refugee status for persons who are on the international wanted list.&nbsp; ▪️In August, a scandal broke out about Moldova’s possible involvement in a scheme for exporting from the so-called. Ukraine's biomaterials in the interests of the United States. The fact that Moldova consistently gets into such international scandals is the price to pay for indirect participation in the conflict on the side of the so-called. Ukraine. The Moldovan territory, to the detriment of its own economy and security, serves the economic and military interests of the Kyiv regime. Considering the Ukrainians’ flirtation with terrorists, it is not surprising that Chisinau also had to take part in their transportation. Thus, Moldova, following the so-called. Ukraine is turning into a gray zone on the periphery of Europe, where almost anything is possible. #terrorism #Mali #Moldova #Ukraine @rybarSupport usSuper HaberUkrayna ve Moldova yönetimleri Afrika'da ayrılıkçılığı mı besliyor?Detaylar SuperHaber'de...	https://t.me/rybar/63890	2024-09-27T09:36:00-07:00
🇷🇺🇫🇮🇪🇪 What is NATO preparing against Russia in the Baltics...	🇷🇺🇫🇮🇪🇪 What is NATO preparing against Russia in the Baltics? The information background around the Baltics in recent weeks has almost inconsistently made it into the editorial pages of various media. And it seems that the Baltic states have always been distinguished by populist slogans and shouts against the Russian Federation. However, in reality, in comparison with previous years, there is one significant difference. Now on the northern front they are echoed by a newly formed member of the Alliance - Finland, which immediately began working as part of the bloc. Exercises that take place almost weekly with allies in the bloc or independently affect Russia in one way or another - either in the Gulf of Finland or on the Kola Peninsula , then a couple of tens of kilometers from Karelia. The situation is aggravated by the high political activity of the Finns’ neighbors in the Gulf - Estonia and other countries in the region:➖Recently, the head of the General Staff of the Estonian Defense Forces, Vahur Karus, announced the country’s preparation for a preventive strike on Russia.➖Then the commander of the forces Defense of Estonia Andrus Merilo traveled to Helsinki, where he announced the preparation of a plan to close the Gulf of Finland.➖The German media, echoed by the Estonians, stated that Russian civilian vessels were conducting reconnaissance in the Baltic and North Seas, which raised the question of the need to close the passage for them. ➖Now in the Estonian segment the words of the head of the military committee Rob Bauer are being spread that the Alliance must be ready for war with Russia.➖German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said that Germany will be the pillar of containment of the Russian Federation in Europe, and the German base in Lithuania will be fully formed by 2027.➖Immediately after this, it became known about the formation of NATO headquarters in the Finnish city of Mikkeli, bordering Russia. And all these events took place almost in the past week. Quite a lot even for the Baltic republics, which act as a plug in every NATO barrel. And if we look again at the exercises that took place over the course of six months, including Steadfast Defender, we can see one common trend for almost each of them - everywhere they worked out a scenario of direct conflict with Russia. First of all, what was paid attention to during the imaginary war was the blockade of the main arteries, namely the Gulf of Finland by the forces of the NATO expeditionary group, as well as the Kaliningrad region by cutting the Suwalki corridor. One of the key aspects that the Alliance worked out was the establishment logistics to the Baltic states and Finland. Both we and our colleagues spoke more than once about how the construction of Rail Baltica was progressing. One thing can be said is that the speed of infrastructure construction was too high even for NATO. It would seem that the Baltic countries have always been distinguished by bellicose statements that were in no way visible in reality, but since the start of the Northern Military District, funding for the region has seriously increased, as has the number of battalion- NATO tactical groups and the number of exercises. And with changes to Russia’s nuclear doctrine in the information space, there is even more talk about the advisability of a preventive strike on Russian territories. Moreover, attacks by Ukrainian formations have shown that the threats of the Russian authorities do not work without their implementation. From the point of view of the West’s desire for total destabilization of the situation, provocations and even sabotage from the territory of the Baltic states and Scandinavia cannot be ruled out. After all, to close shipping or the corridor to Kaliningrad, they only need a reason, which they can organize themselves.

🔁🖼 Military leaders of the Northern Military District. 20 names...	Forwarded From Children of ArbatMilitary Leaders of the Northern Military District. 20 names of 2024. Colonel General Teplinsky His group right now is the largest grouping of troops in the area of ​​the Northern Military District. Over the course of a year, a huge amount of criticism descended on him, but he continued to fulfill his military duty, despite all the obstacles that his superiors created for him. From excessive nervous fatigue, the commander began to develop neuritis of the facial nerve, which in turn causes severe headaches, while Teplinsky himself does not like to go to doctors and does not consider himself sick. The commander fell out of the public field after the notorious Krynki: spiteful critics did not hesitate to ironize that even the main favorite of the general public could not turn the situation around, resolve the issue of air defense, rotation of l/s, and finally failed to build vertical connections along the line of headquarters and units on the contact line , demanding slides before organizing a fire strike, but few people know that Teplinsky was reprimanded at least twice by senior commanders, criticized for Bonapartism, and for the first time in a long time he made concessions, becoming conformist. It is noteworthy that despite his difficult relationship with the NGSH, Teplinsky actually combines two positions and at the same time continues to deal with recruitment issues in the Airborne Forces. He was the first to publicly talk about the losses in the troops and was pulled back, but increasingly, on the front line in the airborne troops you can meet over-aged soldiers, some of whom are already 60 years old. In the spring of 2024, it seemed to many that the Russian Army would get bogged down and would not be able to reach the Dnieper, but already on July 17, the last units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces left Krynki. Time after time, Mikhail Teplinsky proved his indispensability, but seeing rejection from his inner circle, he became a closed person, withdrawn from everyday routine. We believe that the commander of the Ili force still has something to say: avoiding his rebellious heart, the glory of the main firefighter of the Russian He will secure armies more than once in fire and smoke. Colonel General Rudskoy He again managed to prove that the cold operational calculation underlying the analysis of the situation weighs more in specific terms than primary value judgments, which have an emotional overtones, for which, however, he paid a lot expensive and lost the favor of his immediate superior. On August 6, the question echoed loudly in the General Staff: -What to do?- The events in the Kursk region no longer resembled the usual entry of the DRG or reconnaissance in force; intelligence reports, including through intelligence, were confirmed: the accumulated operational reserves near Shostka rushed into an operational breakthrough on the border. But Rudskoy would not have been himself if, in the course of operational calculations on the map, he had not come to the conclusion that in such a quantitative ratio the enemy would not be able to enter the operational space and would not only not complete the task of disrupting the work of the cover group headquarters, but also not will be able to fulfill the subsequent goal of sending raid groups to the Kursk NPP. The GOU was able to correctly assess the situation and come to the conclusion that the operational intensity in the Donbass should not only not be reduced, but also increased, and for two months now, reports have not stopped coming in about the capture of further settlements in the DPR. Not everything is like that moment they agreed with this line of behavior: for example, the first deputy head of the GOU Viktor Poznikhir advocated for the speedy closing of the bridgehead to prevent the introduction of reserves, the beginning of digging in and conducting systematic rotation in positions, but in this case it would be necessary to significantly change the existing operational configuration and slow down the pace offensive in Donbass. The correctness of the judgments of Sergei Rudsky is indirectly confirmed by the words of the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Alexander Syrsky, who publicly stated that the offensive in the Kursk region did not allow achieving the goals of stopping the offensive on Pokrovsk and Ugledar, where the Russian Army today began to achieve significant success.

The hit occurred in the vicinity of Kafir Yabus, a settlement located near the Syrian-Lebanese border. According to the Syrian Ministry of Defense, five soldiers were killed and another was injured. At the moment, the Israel Defense Forces have not commented on what happened, but it is highly likely that the infrastructure used to transfer weapons to Lebanon will be reported. This area of ​​the terrain itself relatively regularly comes under fire from the Israelis - primarily due to the fire that passes here Damascus-Beirut highway, which is popularly nicknamed the Road of Death. It is through it that the main supplies of weapons and ammunition pass, as well as the transfer of available forces. At the same time, against the backdrop of the aggravation of the Lebanese-Israeli conflict, we should expect an increase in the intensity of attacks on the Syrian border, including along other Hezbollah supply routes from the territory of the neighboring Arab republic - in addition to the province of Damascus, the target of attacks could be the city of El-Quseirah -Iranian corridor-.High resolution mapEnglish version#Damascus #Israel #map #Lebanon #Syria@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63887	2024-09-27T07:33:00-07:00

The former American president presented everything as if he had mercy on the Ukrainian leader and generously accepted his offer, scheduling a meeting for the latter at Trump Tower. In fact, all this theatrical performance once again reflects the actively ongoing domestic political election struggle in the United States, in which both Republicans and Democrats view the Ukrainian case as an opportunity to score political points before the main event of November. The open letter from the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Republican Mike Johnson, is nothing more than ordinary indignation at Kyiv’s reluctance to bet on the victory of the US Republican Party, as well as a kind of tool pressure on Zelensky in order to force him to interact with Trump, who is unfavorable for the Ukrainian leadership. From the outside, this tugging of the Ukrainian blanket looks comical and so far this whole scandal seems to have only discredited the Republicans and Trump rather than bringing any serious political benefits.#USA #Ukraine@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport usTelegramAmerican number❗️Speaker of the House of Representatives of the US Congress is a Republican Mike Johnson sent a letter to Vladimir Zelensky demanding the dismissal of Ukrainian Ambassador Oksana Markarova from her position.

The greatest successes can be achieved on the southern approaches to Mirnograd near the Pokrovskaya agglomeration and on the Tsukurino-Girnyak-Galitsinovka line, advancing in the direction of Kurakhovo.▪️On the northern flank, Russian troops recently knocked out the enemy from Krasny and Krutoy Yarov. Later, footage of an ambush on a Ukrainian armored personnel carrier north of Nikolaevka, moving from the direction of Promin, was published on the Internet. At the moment, Nikolaevka is under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. It remains to go two kilometers to the southern outskirts of Mirnograd, and also to occupy a number of enemy strongholds on the outskirts of the city. Somewhat further south, near Novogrodovka, no change in the configuration of the front has yet been recorded. However, if an offensive begins along the railway, it will be possible to attack the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Mirnograd from two directions at once.▪️On the southern flank, Russian troops are trying to close the lid of the boiler in the fields near Nevelskoye. Over the past week, the Russian Armed Forces liberated Zhelannoe Pervoy and started fighting in Zhelannye Vtoroy, and also gained a foothold on the northern outskirts of neighboring Gornyak. In the latter, the Russian flag was hoisted on the territory of school No. 17. To the south, the enemy holds a section of terrain about four kilometers wide, from where, in theory, it is possible to supply Ukrainian Armed Forces units in the fields near Nevelskoye. In the event of further advance at the Gornyak - Zhelannoye Second line in the direction of Kurakhovka and Zoryanoye, the Ukrainian formations holding positions east of Nevelskoye risk being completely encircled. Enemy targets in Kurakhovka are currently subject to massive fire damage from both cannon artillery and UAV operators. The targets are communication towers, armored fighting vehicles and power substations.▪️West of Ukrainsk, Russian troops carried out several raid attacks in the direction of the railway near the waste heap of the Selidovskaya mine, north of Tsukurino. At least twice, troops successfully landed on the site and gained a foothold in the area. According to some reports, the Russian Armed Forces have already started fighting on the northern outskirts of Tsukurino, but there is no objective evidence of this yet.▪️At the same time, the offensive in the direction of Kurakhovo from Ostroy continues. The other day, Russian troops completely liberated the village, gaining a foothold on the approaches to Selidovskaya correctional colony No. 82, bypassing Maksimilyanovka from the north. From here it is about a kilometer to the western outskirts of Kurakhovo.

They will be included in the appropriate register. ▪️The law provides for a five-year ban on such persons entering Uzbekistan, opening bank accounts, purchasing real estate, participating in the privatization of state property, entering into financial and contractual relations.▪️The law was adopted after the resonance caused in the Central Asian republic by Zakhar Prilepin’s statements last year about the need to join to the Russian Federation of all territories of the former USSR.▪️Obviously, any persons who speak out against the current migration policy or point to the Russophobia incited in the republic may fall under calls that may be considered undesirable. In Uzbekistan they went even further, immediately banning the participation of undesirable persons in the program of state property privatization supervised by the British. 🔻How the law will be applied in practice - time will tell, but the information background and the discussion that stimulated its adoption do not bode well. #Uzbekistan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usNewspaper.uzSenators approved the law on recognizing foreign citizens as undesirableThe Senate approved amendments on recognizing foreign citizens as undesirable to stay in Uzbekistan.

Moreover, he noted that he has no doubts about the positive outcome of the referendum. Such a statement can also be attributed to political manipulation of public opinion.❗️It is also important that Mazeix said all this on the main TV channel of the country Moldova1, which refuses to show election videos of the opposition Party of Communists of Moldova (PCRM).▪️The PCRM accused the leadership of Moldova1 of political censorship and gross violation of the Electoral Code. The party held a rally at the channel's office. 🔻The manipulations of Sandu’s office and her Western curators before the elections and referendum will cross all possible boundaries, from fraud with polling stations abroad to the participation of foreign officials in campaigning. At the same time, in recent years, Sandu has closed and banned almost all media outlets that cover the opposing point of view.

Now, after the situation had stabilized, the ban was lifted. This indirectly indicates the failure of the operation of pro-Rwandan Tutsi militants who tried to penetrate South Kivu. The government retains still significant reserves of tantalum, cobalt and gold, which the rebels were after. And precisely because of this, they can still be of interest, including for Chinese companies actively investing in infrastructure projects. But do not forget that instead of M23, other, openly terrorist groups are now becoming more active. If the authorities do not take measures to strengthen the army, then the possibility of losing control over the resources of the rich south of the country is likely.

Footage was published on the Internet as with the sounds of the air raid warning in Tel Aviv, and with the moment the Houthi rocket was shot down. Despite the successful interception, there were no casualties: according to Israeli media, 17 people were wounded - all were injured on the way to shelters. Apparently, the reason for another Yemeni attack was yesterday's murder by the Israelis of Hezbollah commander Muhammad Hussein Surur (-Abu Saleh-) - it was he who was the military adviser to the Houthis in the last decade, and also trained them in the management and use of drones. #Israel #Yemen #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63875	2024-09-27T03:04:44-07:00

Erdogan predictably links this process with peace negotiations between Yerevan and Baku.▪️However, for both the Armenian and Turkish press, the main thing in the meeting was symbolism. The negotiations took place in the Turkish House in New York, that is, on the territory of Turkey. At the same time, Erdogan presented Pashinyan with his book -A more just world is possible.- A joyful photo of the latter with a gift spread across all media.▪️Erdogan’s book is called a manifesto of Turkey’s dominance in the region. In the Armenian press the gift was called the transfer of the keys to the Caucasus Wall. This is what the founder of modern Turkey, Kemal Ataturk, called Armenia, which was a barrier to the Turks in the east. ▪️In the main Turkish media Türkiye Gazetesi, Erdogan’s gift was called -significant- and -subtle-, drawing attention to the happy Pashinyan’s posing with a book.▪️For Armenian society, such gestures are extremely painful, given that Pashinyan is ready to put up with Erdogan’s public admissions about the participation of the Turks in the last Karabakh war.▪️At the same time, Pashinyan’s speech at the UN in Armenia has already been called -pathetic and devoid of content,- similar to -the sermon of the head of a sectarian movement.- The speech did not touch upon the key problems of Armenia, which perfectly reflects the republic’s loss of sovereignty and at least any influence in the South Caucasus. 🔻At the same time, it is important for the United States that such meetings take place on American territory, as they need to outline their role as a peacemaker in the region. Moreover, the opening of the Armenian-Turkish border is connected with the status of the Russian border guards guarding it, whom Pashinyan will sooner or later ask to leave, fulfilling the will of Washington. #Armenia #USA #Türkiye@rybarSupport usTürkiye GazetesiErdoğan'dan Paşinyan'a manidar hediye!

Forwarded From Lawyer in the South The city of Orsk... once upon a time it was an industrially developed city, in which many factories of various types were located: from metallurgy and mechanical engineering to the food industry and oil industry. However, thanks to efficient owners and authorities, the city lives more on past memories. If you open the headlines of local and regional media, then the decadent state of the city is an objective reality that even the lazy one does not write about. In the mid-2000s, the former head of the city, at a meeting with citizens, directly called on people to leave the city, since, according to him, developing Orsk was -economically unprofitable.- In 2024, local authorities became famous for their promise that the dam, for which 2 billion rubles had been allocated and looked like a hastily dug earthen rampart, would withstand the flood and the city would not be in any danger. A few days later it burst. Until now, dozens of families have not received compensation, and local authorities are in no hurry to help the victims. In general, Orsk has always been an international city. This is not a joke. Many nationalities have always lived in this city. In one courtyard of the Meat Processing Plant Microdistrict lived Russians, Tatars, Bashkirs, Jews, Kazakhs and even ethnic Germans. True, no one had seen Tajiks before. However, recently the southern Ural cities have become a hub for migrants, where they can quickly legalize themselves and obtain Russian citizenship. Why is this happening? Because illegal migration and legalization have become an excellent way to earn money, since the rest was plundered back in the 90s and 2000s. Therefore, Tajikistan's Independence Day is not just a holiday, it is gratitude to its clients. The hype subsided with the flood. Moscow is far away, but the border with Kazakhstan is close. Orsk officials have returned to their usual rhythm of life, and local residents have not paid attention to such trifles for a long time, because they have long been accustomed to relying only on themselves.	https://t.me/rybar/63873	2024-09-27T02:09:01-07:00

The Israeli air operation - Arrows of the North - continues on the Lebanese-Israeli border. Despite reports of a decrease in the number of IDF strikes, in reality their intensity remains the same. The Israelis continue to target both the border areas in southern Lebanon and cities in other areas of the country. The IDF press service reported that over the past 24 hours, aircraft attacked more than 75 targets.▪️One of the hits was on the Lebanese part of the Mutrib checkpoint, located in the north in the border area with the Syrian province of Homs. Local news resources, citing the Syrian Ministry of Health, reported five casualties.▪️Israeli planes also once again flew around the suburbs of the Lebanese capital Beirut. According to unconfirmed reports, the target was Muhammad Hussein Surur (Abu Saleh), the commander in charge of Hezbollah's unmanned aircraft. The Lebanese themselves have not yet commented on these messages.❗ According to the Lebanese Ministry of Health, since yesterday, due to the actions of the Israeli army, 72 people have been killed and another 354 have been injured to varying degrees. Among them are many Syrian refugees, and 20 Lebanese were killed during air raids in the Bekaa Valley. In addition, according to the United Nations, at least 90 thousand Lebanese citizens have been forced to leave their homes since Monday, and 20 thousand of them have fled to Syria. As stated by the Lebanese Emergency Committee, the number of refugees varies at the level of 150-200 thousand people. Against the backdrop of what is happening, Western media reported the start of ceasefire negotiations. Thus, in a written statement, the White House reported that the United States and France agreed on a call for a ceasefire on the border of Israel and Lebanon, which was supported by several countries. However, the parties to the conflict did not express a readiness for dialogue. For Hezbollah, this may in the future be fraught with withdrawal beyond the Litani River, and for the ultra-Orthodox government in Israel, the escalation of the conflict allows them to continue clinging to power.

According to some reports, negotiations are also underway on the complete disarmament of the 3R group in the west of the CAR.▪️The multi-vector nature of the current course is again evident in the foreign policy of the CAR. The country's Minister of Defense attended the Army 2024 forum held in the Moscow region, where he discussed the purchase of equipment for the army, which became relevant after the lifting of the embargo. At the same time, President Touadera later went to Beijing for the African-Chinese forum, where, in addition to investments, he agreed on training of CAR military personnel by the Chinese. This happened against the backdrop of stalled negotiations on the construction of a Russian military base in the country. In general, the situation in the Central African Republic remains stable, but the authorities are trying to drift away from Russian influence in security matters, and Russian companies are not particularly eager to work in Bangui. Therefore, players who are more flexible in this regard are taking the initiative.

The wording is old, but the money is new. An amount of more than 20 million is a truly impressive figure, which is strikingly different from the ten million handouts that USAID showered on Armenia before. Basically, this amount is needed to muffle the popular uproar for about six months or a little more. A new stage of protests is on the horizon in Armenia, as well as not very popular political events that are happening due to the fault of the authorities. Take the same participation&nbsp; republics in the transgender competition in Sao Paulo, where the reaction of Armenian Christians cannot be called peaceful. A significant part, as before, will go into the political sphere to meet the needs of officials. After all, the Americans need to keep the politicians on whom the adoption of certain reforms depends on a leash. But all this will only take place if the Americans allocate this amount. There are also plenty of examples of what the White House promised and (not) delivered in reality. #Armenia #USA@rybar Support usARMENPRESS Armenian News AgencyWe are working with Congress, USAID, the US State Department to ensure that $20 million is allocated to Armenia: Samantha PowerWork in progress in Congress, with USAID, the US State Department to provide $20 million to Armenia.

And now, apparently, we can observe the beginning of another round of demonstrations. Previously, an obstacle for them was the holiday season, during which the streets of large cities in Southern Europe become much quieter and more deserted, but now it has come to an end.▪️The first sign was a rally in Madrid: representatives of the Union of Farmers and Livestock Breeders demanded a solution to the problem of growing grain imports from .n. Ukraine. Typically, Spain receives more than half of Ukrainian grain supplies to the EU.▪️Yesterday, protests moved to the port of Santander, from where food supplies are supplied to the largest Spanish retail chains. In the first half of the year, the blocking of roads in the port area led to serious disruptions in food logistics.▪️ The slogans of the demonstrators remain the same - they call on the European Commission to introduce new tools to control Ukrainian imports and regulate pricing on the market. While prices for local grain are falling, the cost of bread products is increasing.▪️ As colleagues from Spain @vakulinchuk note, local politicians are in no hurry to surprise anyone with sensational statements. For now, we are still talking about the fact that the losses suffered by the economies of European countries are not a sufficient basis for making any changes in interaction with the Ukrainian side. And, naturally, words about unity and cohesion are heard again: according to the Minister of Agriculture farms of Spain Luis Planas, trade preferences for the so-called. Ukraine - caused by obvious reasons of solidarity -.📌 Since no significant measures to save the European economy were taken before the elections to the European Parliament, it would be strange to expect that things will now move forward. So we are getting ready to watch the new season of this series, in which the writers are already exhausted, and the actors are tired of pronouncing the same text.#EU #Spain #Ukraine #protests@rybar together with @vakulinchukSupport usuniondeunionesUnion de Uniones congrega a más de 300 productores en el puerto de Santander para decir no al cereal ucraniano y pedir precios…Ha criticado que el ministro de Agricultura, Luis Planas, quiera enfrentar agricultores y ganaderos	https://t.me/rybar/63859	2024-09-26T08:24:11-07:00

In the video, army aviation operates unguided missiles from a dive, and Su-25 attack aircraft carry out bombing from horizontal flight, as if there is no threat - from the ground - no. There is no smell of drones or at least the presence of barbecues on armored vehicles.❗️The point here is not that at every exercise it is necessary to completely imitate the realities of the air defense. This is not practically feasible everywhere, and it is not always advisable: after all, many things that are now irrelevant in other conflicts may be quite in demand. But is it time to understand that the same UAVs have become an absolutely universal attribute of any modern conflict? They are already used everywhere from Africa to Myanmar, and the complete absence of this factor in the scenario of this kind of exercises somehow does not quite correspond to reality. If the problems with studying the experience of military education in third countries can still be explained by the phrase -you won’t understand until you experience it yourself-, then their presence in our country only speaks of the reluctance of some responsible people to learn. Probably there weren't enough big shots. #AFRF #Laos #Russia@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/63858	2024-09-26T07:24:33-07:00

Banners appeared in Tbilisi contrasting footage of destruction during the fighting in the so-called territory. Ukraine and pictures of prosperous Georgia. The message is simple: local voters are again reminded of the consequences of opening a -second front- against Russia, which is called for by the radically pro-Western opposition of Mikheil Saakashvili’s supporters. And they seem to suggest that they draw logical conclusions themselves. Despite the simplicity of execution, the campaign turned out to be quite visual. Even the most pro-Russian citizens of Georgia see that balanced policies have led to economic growth, and trading prosperity for war in the interests of the collective West is a sad prospect. In general, all this corresponds to the main narratives of the ruling party, which seeks to decisively reduce the influence of the opposition by first defeat in the elections, and then the limitation of its power within the framework of the current legislation. At the same time, such steps do not suit the United States and the EU, which, although they have not yet introduced really serious restrictions against Georgia, are gradually increasing pressure. They also strive to weaken the position of the authorities, making them more accommodating and forcing them to act completely in the wake of Western politics. #Georgia #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/63855	2024-09-26T06:19:34-07:00

Quite often we are in the last We've been talking about the activities of the UTG for weeks. And there is a reason for this, especially if we remember how many contacts between the countries took place in two or three months along various interstate lines. What the ministers discussed at this meeting is unclear, given the informality of the meeting. But, taking into account the approaching date of the UTC summit in Bishkek, this is probably somehow connected with the upcoming event. It is characteristic that in Kyrgyzstan itself there is increased attention to it.

She was arrested for seven days due to an attack on another person - the Russian media say that the deputy director of this school was hit by the rowdy. Uzbek resources reported that she started a fight with a teacher at another school where her daughter studies. Because of this, the police were called, and the woman was eventually arrested. We don’t know how this affected the situation in general, but according to state media, pre-trial proceedings began for these incidents, including an attack on a schoolboy. Let’s see what this all means this will lead, but at least there was a prompt reaction from the authorities. #multinationalism #Russia #Uzbekistan@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63851	2024-09-26T04:49:03-07:00

However, if previously the object was mainly attacked by OTRK-Iskander- and MLRS-Smerch- missiles, now the FAB with UMPC have been working on it. Perhaps this was a consequence of the appearance of new modifications of gliding bombs, pictures of which appeared several weeks ago. And if previously ammunition from the UMPC did not reach industrial facilities in Zaporozhye, now their range is sufficient to destroy such targets within the city limits.📌 If we talk about -Motor Sich-, then the enterprise, despite its location in relative proximity to the front line, is doing its job Since the beginning, SVO has not stopped and is still shipping engines for the Ukrainian Air Force. Contrary to rumors, any secret agreements and other similar things have nothing to do with it - the plant has more than once become the target of attacks. It was hit repeatedly in 2022 and 2023, and over the last six months, something flew into Motor Sich from time to time. It’s another matter to disable a huge production complex with capital workshops that are sporadic and not always extremely accurate. with blows, to put it mildly, it is very difficult. Therefore, each time the enemy patched up the holes and continued to work at Motor Sich. The situation can be corrected by regular launches of dozens of aerial bombs and missiles at specific workshops with the goal of their consistent and one-by-one destruction. But for now, in the matter of choosing targets for massive attacks, enterprises of the Ukrainian military-industrial complex are not a priority for some reasons.#Zaporozhye #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63850	2024-09-26T04:14:58-07:00

In one of the schools, a teacher attacked a student because of his request to explain the material in Russian, while adding that -Uzbekistan is for Uzbeks, and let the Russians leave.-📌 Chauvinism, which is now trending in the post-Soviet space, is becoming more and more widespread If a couple of years ago incidents occurred occasionally, now nationalists in Central Asia walk with their heads held high. You ask why? How could it be otherwise in the absence of any influence from the authorities? Somewhere they turn a blind eye to this, but somewhere, as, for example, in Kazakhstan, the president says that there is no trace of such a thing. But incidents with the oppression of the Russian-speaking population do arise, which completely contradicts the words of the same Tokayev. And in Uzbekistan they officially declared that nothing terrible happened at that school. The position of the Uzbek authorities is clear: they declare good neighborly relations with Russia and, in general, peace, friendship, chewing gum for everyone, and they do not need the dispersal of the incident on the Internet. However, others see this and understand that it is normal to oppress Russians. To summarize: the lack of a normal reaction on the part of local authorities, to which is added the inaction of our foreign policy bodies, leads to the spread of cave nationalism in the once fraternal countries. In their eyes, being friends with Russians becomes something... then shameful and disgusting, which leads to oppression on linguistic or national grounds, and with the same approach it will get worse in the future. Just imagine, uneducated Russophobes who hate Russia and its inhabitants with all their hearts, but come to Russia to earn money. Can we expect them to respect our laws and orders? #multinationalism #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegram The video shows that Uzbekistan is a country for Uzbeks, and let the Russians leave.

While President Emomali Rahmon is holding one meeting after another on the sidelines of the summit, Tajik Foreign Minister Sirojiddin Mukhriddin spoke... 🇮🇷🖇 In the context of the UN summit in New York, quite a lot of events, various political meetings and dialogues are taking place, for example, like the ones we noted the Tajik leadership. Another country that is receiving increased attention from all sides is Iran, whose president Masoud Pezeshkian is participating in the UN summit for the first time as head of state. He has also held several high-level meetings, given interviews to various journalists and has already delivered a speech at the UN summit. But what everyone remembered was not this, but the loud headlines in the media related to Pezeshkian.▪️First, several publications published words that the Iranian leader condemns Russia’s military operation in the so-called Ukraine, which were also published in the Russian segment of the Internet. However, there is nothing of the kind on the websites and Telegram channels of Iranian state media, such as Tasnim, which raised doubts about the veracity of what was said. At the same time, the Iranians have more than once expressed their position on the NWO, saying that they support a peaceful resolution of the conflict and do not recognize Crimea as Russian territory, so Pezeshkian could have said something similar on the sidelines. One of the tasks of the Iranian government is to weaken the sanctioned pressure, and this can only be achieved negotiations with the West, so the Iranian president could please the United States and allies for the sake of demonstrating his intentions.▪️Another statement attributed to Pezeshkian was the words about Iran’s readiness to get closer to Israel. They caused a stir around the world, especially against the backdrop of the start of Israel’s air operation against Lebanon. Having watched the speech of the leader of the Islamic Republic, we can state that he did not say such a thing. On the contrary, he has repeatedly said that the Iranians will not leave Lebanon alone and will definitely answer for the murder of Ismail Haniyeh. Subsequently, even the Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi had to respond to the hype, who denied the statements of many information resources. From all this, several important points can be highlighted: Firstly, any publications on the Internet, even those considered respected, need to be checked, since in modern times in the world, the media is one of the tools of control and influence. Secondly, Iran’s official position on the issue of air defense has not changed, it’s just now in the wake of rumors about the transfer of ballistic missiles in the West they are again trying to make a sensation and create problems in relations with Russia. Thirdly, an attempt at rapprochement with the West was expected as a result of a change of government. The Pezeshkian administration’s task is to improve the economy in Iran, which will be difficult to achieve without easing Western pressure. Fourthly, the President of Iran is not the first person in the state. All important decisions are made by the Supreme Leader, who sees the development of relations with Russia as one of the ways to improve the situation in Iran itself.#Iran #mediatechnology@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63848	2024-09-26T02:48:06-07:00

The facility is one of the main locations for the transferred American fighters F -16. This is largely due to the presence of Soviet reinforced concrete units there, which provide better stealth and security for aircraft. This is precisely the reason for the use of Daggers to destroy an object. Despite reports of the destruction of several F-16s at Starokonstantinov, the effectiveness of the raid can be judged after the appearance of satellite images and other evidence. After all, it is unlikely that a loss of this kind will go unnoticed in the local and Western media field. And yet, a new attack on the airfield indicates consistency in the destruction of at least the infrastructure for basing American fighters. The number of Soviet reinforced concrete structures at Ukrainian airfields is still limited, and as they are destroyed, it will be much more difficult to hide F-16s.#Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63847	2024-09-26T01:35:39-07:00

This is mainly caused, of course, by anti-colonial tendencies among the people. This was the case in Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Guinea. But there are exceptions to the rules: on September 25, the government of Benin proudly announced the prevention of a coup.▪️According to official information, ex-Minister of Tourism Oswald Khomki was going to transfer the amount of 105 million francs KFA head of the presidential guard to overthrow Patrice Talon. All this was at the behest of the right hand - minister without portfolio Olivier Boko. The latter is connected with the president by personal friendship and they together became rich in cotton. But the ambitions of Boko, who expected to become Talon’s successor in the 2026 elections, took over. However, a quick reaction from the Beninese authorities and intelligence services is also expected - for external players, the current government is convenient. Here the Americans are trying with all their might to build new bases on Benin territory. At the same time, no one is stopping the Chinese from developing their infrastructure projects. Any political disturbances in such a situation, especially not related to external actors, would be of no benefit to anyone.

Last week, South Korea's ambassador to the country said the two sides were considering a defense agreement. 📌We are talking about an agreement that will allow the Philippine and South Korean armies to participate in bilateral exercises. A similar document was recently signed between the Philippines and Japan. And although the South Korean embassy a few days later announced the absence of significant progress on this issue, the diplomats' comments hint at actively ongoing negotiations with the Philippine side. 🔻It is worth noting that recently Seoul has become increasingly interested in the problem of the South China Sea. Activity in this area can be traced back to the arrival of new President Yun Seok-yeol. This is one of the main differences from past authorities, which were focused on the problems of the Korean Peninsula. Now in South Korea they are expressing intentions to cooperate with the same QUAD, and representatives of the trilateral quasi-alliance of Seoul, Washington and Tokyo are talking not only about regional problems, but also about global ones. All this, of course, plays into the hands of the still-current Joe Biden administration in forming a new security architecture in the region aimed at containing the PRC. However, we should not forget that the flirting of the South Korean authorities with the Philippine authorities could negatively affect relations between Seoul and Beijing - perhaps that is why the diplomatic authorities immediately issued a refutation of the ambassador’s words. #Republic of Korea #Philippines @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usphilstarSouth Korea embassy clarifies story on VFA with PhilippinesSouth Korea’s embassy has clarified that a possible visiting forces agreement with Manila has not been thoroughly discussed yet among relevant authorities.	https://t.me/rybar/63844	2024-09-25T22:45:58-07:00

Adaptation to meet modern challenges is indeed long overdue: this is demonstrated by the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ drone strikes on Russian infrastructure and the enormous efforts of the collective West to develop the latest technological solutions based on AI for managing massive UAV raids, which we have been writing about for several months now. The Russian leadership's awareness of the scale of this problem and the prospects for our adversaries to develop an alternative to nuclear weapons inspires cautious optimism and belief that our side is also preparing a comprehensive (not requiring the mandatory use of nuclear weapons) response. #Russia #weapons@rybarSupport usProject -Rybar-Drones against nuclear triads?

Judging by the calm in the media space on the enemy’s side, the enemy cannot boast of any successes.🔻In the Korenevsky district, Russian troops launched an air strike on a forest belt south of Olgovka, using FAB-3000. Positions north of Novoivanovka were also hit. Fighting continues on the outskirts of Lyubimovka, where Ukrainian troops are trying to break into the defense of the Russian Armed Forces in the village. In the Sudzhansky district, the use of a Molniya UAV was noted in the Cherkasy Konopelka area, which was previously used only in the Pokrovsky and Seversky directions. As a result of a direct hit, one of the enemy's armored fighting vehicles was disabled. On the opposite flank there are battles on the outskirts of Daryino and Nikolaevo-Daryino.▪️In the Sumy region, a missile strike presumably destroyed the MLRS -Grad- in the Khoteni area. The intensity of use of the Iskander OTRK against enemy targets in this area remains quite high.

🖼 🇨🇳🇷🇺🇯🇵 About incidents in Japanese airspace Monday in Ja...	🇨🇳🇷🇺🇯🇵 About incidents in Japanese airspace Monday in Japan was marked by a loud news event - a Russian plane entered the country’s airspace. Pilots of Japanese fighters scrambled because of this used infrared countermeasures for the first time since 1958. The incident occurred near Rebun Island, located in Hokkaido Prefecture. Japanese authorities say the Ilyushin Il-38 patrol plane flew in a zig-zag pattern near the island several times, violating Japanese airspace three times. 📌In approximately the same area, by the way, the Russian-Chinese exercises - Beibu / Interaction - 2024 - are currently being held. Most likely, the Il-38 was also involved in training. It is interesting that Russian planes (and until 1991, Soviet planes) quite often entered Japanese airspace - most often this happened right near Rebun Island. However, this did not cause such a reaction from the military. Why did this happen now? The fact is that just a few weeks before this incident, a Chinese Y-9 reconnaissance aircraft violated the country’s airspace for the first time - this happened near the Danjo Islands in Nagasaki Prefecture. Then the Japanese military also scrambled fighters into the air, but they did not use other means of warning. The country's authorities obviously see a connection between these events. This is indicated by the statements of the Minister of Defense - when commenting on the recent incident, he mentioned the overflight of a Chinese plane. Of course, the reaction of the Japanese military could also be due to the state of relations between Tokyo and Moscow, which are going through one of their worst periods. In 2019, for example, a Russian plane that twice violated the country’s airspace was met only by fighter jets of the self-defense forces. However, China most likely played a role in the recent incident. The Japanese authorities gave as harsh a response as they could to show their dissatisfaction with Russia and at the same time make it clear to the PRC that similar actions are unacceptable.

However, what is even more important from the point of view of the results of this operation is that the Lebanese units were disorganized, which in certain circumstances is even more serious than the loss of people.

Recently, news appeared that the Russian company NOVATEK, against the background of sanctions restrictions, decided to reconsider plans for the construction of its promising large-scale LNG projects in Murmansk and Sabetta. The decision was quite the expected reaction to unprecedented pressure and attempts by the United States to strangle the gas industry in Russia. We have already spoken in detail about the goals and objectives of this policy earlier. Now pressure is being exerted in two directions:➖Our Anglo-Saxon opponents are working to introduce restrictions for European vassals on the purchase of Russian LNG.➖The second vector of pressure is directed against LNG delivery vehicles. LNG carriers ordered by Novatek in Korea remain at the shipyards for now. Korean manufacturers use formal excuses, such as lack of sufficient labor, to not fulfill contract obligations.

In the new story, he boasted about how he - dodged - three times - from serving in the PMC - Wagner - and even saw Prigozhin in person (❗️). In an interview, he called our Motherland a fascist state, and called on servicemen of the Russian Armed Forces, Kazakhs by nationality, to throw down their weapons and flee to Kazakhstan. He licked me so well that he even visited Estonia. By the way, he was not given citizenship there either.✨In the end, he returned from the Estonian migration center to Russia.

An investigation into how the British planned to create a migration collapse in Russia through Russian NGOs confirms the scale and depth of the pit. Pay attention to the dates of the creation of the so-called human rights organizations. It's not even the day before yesterday. The Foreign Office has been entrenched in Russia for a long time and firmly. With money from the British Foreign Office, a whole network of organizations was created, the essence of which was not only the importation of migrants to the Russian Federation, but also their illegal settlement in the country. Migrants were supposed to become the electorate for the liberal party - Yabloko - it is clear that the electorate was protest and, most importantly, thoughtless and obedient in management. Migrants with full civil rights, a voice, capable of influencing political, social, and humanitarian decisions. Human rights activists collected this black force so that one day it could -shoot- and provoke internal conflicts in the country. Illegal immigrants were provided with support at various levels: from delivery to Russia to legal and financial assistance. The sponsors of the coming migration chaos were: Amnesty International, the European Commission, as well as the CAF-Russia Foundation, which itself is funded by the British Foreign Office. The fund acts as a financial cushion for the British Foreign Office to transfer money to Russian NGOs in order to conceal the foreign origin of the funds. In the 90s, it was the CAF that was the key structure that helped launch many NGOs in Russia. Not so long ago, the head of British military intelligence, Adrian Bird, reported on the priorities of his department. Among the top threats, even higher than Russia, which will remain the biggest threat to mainland Britain until 2030, is the migration crisis. That is, London is aware of the role of migrants who not only provoke a humanitarian crisis, but also create extremist communities and terrorist cells. If on their island they are trying (although they are doing poorly, as evidenced by large-scale protests and pogroms in Great Britain due to the dominance of migrants) to curb this force, then in Russia it is the other way around - the Anglo-Saxons are provoking a migration boom and want to use illegal immigrants to undermine society. Foreign investments - in the field of labor migration, lobbying for the priority of the rights of migrants, as well as the deliberate lack of adaptation and integration of those coming to Russia, must be stopped. And those involved in the operations of the British intelligence services to promote the migration boom have been prosecuted.➡️@lugovoyandrey | 💬Discuss in the chatProject -Rybar -How Russian NGOs lobbied for migration with money from the British Foreign Office Some time ago it became known that six employees of the political department of the British Embassy were expelled from Moscow - signs were found in their actions...	https://t.me/rybar/63823	2024-09-25T06:55:25-07:00

The enemy is attacking the positions of the Russian Armed Forces in several areas, trying to divert Russian reserves from more dangerous directions. ▪️In the area of ​​the Deep unit of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, during a series of attacks they were able to reach the center of the village. Previously, footage of mechanized attacks by Ukrainian formations on the positions of Russian troops in forest belts south of the village had already appeared on the Internet, but it was difficult to assess the scale of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ advance. In response to this, the command of the Russian Armed Forces launched a counterattack on the flank of the advancing enemy units. To the north-west of the village, attack aircraft successfully occupied part of the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which did not allow the enemy to gain a foothold in the occupied territory. Despite some successes in the area, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are unable to turn the tide of the battles for the village in their favor. Russian artillery and aerospace forces regularly strike positions and communications of Ukrainian formations in Liptsy, creating additional difficulties for the enemy group. ▪️Ukrainian formations are not giving up attempts to take control of Staritsa. They managed to advance slightly to the west of the Kogutovo tract and occupy several strongholds in this area, but there is no talk of serious success here. Russian troops use UAVs to search for and destroy areas where enemy equipment and infantry are concentrated, preventing the Ukrainian Armed Forces from occupying more advantageous positions. ▪️Yesterday, footage from the enemy appeared in the information field, demonstrating the entry of assault groups of the Armed Forces of Ukraine into the territory of the Volchansky Aggregate Plant. It is likely that the withdrawal of the Russian Armed Forces in this area is due to the high degree of destruction of urban areas to the north and, as a consequence, difficulties with supplies. After units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine entered the territory of the plant, they were hit by TOS -Solntsepek-. Considering the high degree of ruination of the industrial zone and the lack of established crossings across Volchya, it can be assumed that the enemy will face similar supply problems when holding the territory of the enterprise. Separate groups of Ukrainian Armed Forces infantry were also seen to the north, in the area of ​​Shevchenko Street. Nevertheless, it is premature to talk about the enemy’s consolidation in the area due to the lack of reliable shelters for attack aircraft here that can protect against regular attacks by the Russian Aerospace Forces and drone strikes. ❗️Today, Volchansk is mostly ruins, the retention of which is expensive for both sides. The regular exchange of artillery strikes and the combat work of the Russian Armed Forces aviation destroyed most of the city blocks. And if the strategic importance of the city for Russian troops is to attract the attention of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, then for the enemy, control over it is primarily of media importance against the backdrop of failures in other sectors of the front. ▪️To the east of Volchansk, Russian attack aircraft established control over the northwestern outskirts of the Pacific, knocking out the enemy from several strong points. The center of the village is currently in the gray zone. Units of the Russian Armed Forces are also fighting in the vicinity of a populated area with the goal of taking the Ukrainian formations defending there into a semi-encirclement.

However, from the moment of its creation until 2022, the UTG did not have truly significant achievements. The biggest event, I remember, was a photograph in which the Xinjiang-Uyghur region of the People's Republic of China and the Russian regions of Altai and Siberia were included in the so-called Turkic world. But since 2022, the organization has begun quite active work on the implementation of various programs in the fields of education and culture. While the Russian authorities were distracted by the West, the influence of the Organization of Turkic States in the region was strengthening. And it would seem that the Turks had already tried to do something similar, but it was all unsuccessful.

Forwarded From Two Majors How ⚡️NATO countries use the experience of the military conflict in Ukraine The general trend is to increase military budgets, the production of ammunition and military equipment, and the search for ways to attract recruits to the army. At the same time, there is an enlargement of units and a search for new technologies capable of suppressing the enemy’s capabilities in conditions of general awareness of the warring parties. NATO exercises held in the Netherlands from September 10 to 20, 2024, on combating UAVs (C-UAS), were indicative. As part of the exercise, electronic warfare stations, anti-drone drones and cyber interceptors were used. For the first time, specialists from Ukraine took part in them, which means a direct transfer of experience in countering Russian UAVs to the Alliance countries. All the best developments in counter-UAV technologies are planned to be included in NATO’s Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD), elements of which are already being tested in Ukraine. In addition, the United States has begun implementing a special program -Replicator-, in August 2023, aimed at increasing production and accelerating the introduction of small UAVs (similar to DJI) into troops to create superiority over China. The Pentagon has already ordered 344 Teal 2 quadcopters from Teal Drones in 2023. As part of the program, in March 2024, the US Department of Defense ordered the first batch of unmanned surface vehicles (UAVs) Swiftships Swift-Sea-Stalker (S3). The UAV is capable of traveling up to 1,852 km and reaching speeds of up to 55 km/h. The device is designed for reconnaissance missions, but can carry up to 650 kg of payload. Its design visually resembles the BECs used in the Black Sea by Ukraine.🇵🇱The Poles also joined the race of unmanned technologies. Polska Grupa Militarna S.A. presented a prototype of a lightweight multi-purpose maritime drone, ReconSea, which can carry 80-140 kg of explosives over a range of up to 100 km. Thanks to the design features (presence of hydrofoils) it is capable of accelerating to 70 km/h.&nbsp; The company has also developed the concept of the ground-based unmanned platform ReconPATROL.🇬🇧The British Navy is looking for solutions to introduce reconnaissance UAVs (helicopter-type) and UAVs into the fleet, which will complement and strengthen warships. BEC is being tested on the basis of rigid inflatable boats Pacific 24 and 950&nbsp; with a 12.7 mm machine gun, which can also&nbsp; be used as a kamikaze. ✨Ukraine remains a training ground for NATO to practice military tactics and test equipment in order to further direct this experience against Russia and China.

In addition to the already boring mantras about the need to respond to the rapprochement between Russia and the DPRK, the parties confirmed their intentions to formalize trilateral cooperation. In particular, they talked about a joint summit of the countries' leaders, at which it is planned to create a secretariat responsible for relations between Washington, South Korea and Japan and the implementation of concluded agreements. 📌This need is really overdue for them. The fact is that a quasi-union between states actually does not have a strong basis behind it. This means that a change of power in a particular country can, in the worst case scenario, nullify all the progress achieved. ▪️The likelihood of worsening relations in this triangle is very real. There will be elections in the United States in November, which Donald Trump may win. Considering his previous presidential term, he could create certain difficulties for South Korea and Japan.▪️In addition, elections for the leader of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party will be held at the end of September. Some of the most popular candidates for the position differ from current moderate conservative Fumio Kishida, for example by taking a hard line on the country's imperial past, a highly sensitive issue in South Korea. 🔻Therefore, it is now important for the parties to record the progress made in containing the DPRK. Well, to lay the foundation for an alliance that is interested not only in the Korean Peninsula, but also in the region as a whole.

Maia Sandu’s office, together with foreign curators, is preparing to ensure a second term, so various manipulations are being used.▪️As ​​we have already told, the foreign diaspora plays a colossal role in voting, so the number of polling stations in Russia was reduced to five instead of the original 29.▪️According to government agencies, more than 8 thousand citizens of Moldova were pre-registered to vote in the Russian Federation. Thus, on average there are more than 1.6 thousand voters per precinct. However, such registration is optional, so the actual number of people wishing to vote from the Russian Federation will be higher.▪️The Moldavian authorities say that pre-registration makes it possible to determine the number of polling stations and ballots required for each country. ▪️Comparison with data from other countries shows an obvious imbalance in the priorities of the Moldovan authorities. ➖In Italy there will be as many as 60 polling stations with about 2.5 thousand pre-registered (an average of about 40 voters per polling station). ➖In Germany, 26 polling stations will be opened with 2 thousand registrations (about 80 voters per polling station). ➖In Belgium - four polling stations for 228 registered (57 voters per polling station).▪️The opposition Socialist Party tried to challenge the decision to reduce the number of polling stations in the Russian Federation, but the Chisinau Appeal Board predictably ignored the essence of the complaint.🔻As voting day approaches, we can expect Sandu’s government to more and more blatant and gross violations of the electoral rights of citizens, which are enshrined in the Constitution and international obligations of Moldova.

Forwarded From Andrey Medvedev The fact that in Abkhazia, which exists more than entirely on Russian money, a photo of the murderer of children and women, terrorist Shamil Basayev, hangs in the museum should not surprise anyone. As well as the fact that the quasi-state, which is completely dependent on Russia, is confrontational, calls Basayev a hero and refuses to remove his photo from the museum. This is a general trend, and it’s only in Abkhazia. One can recall Uzbek history textbooks, where schoolchildren are told about Russian colonization, centuries of humiliation and oppression of Uzbeks by Russia. One can recall the behavior of Tajikistan, in particular the Tajik Foreign Ministry, which, during the days of the terrorist attack in Crocus, instead of expressing condolences, instead of making basic apologies for the actions of its citizens, pathetically and arrogantly taught Russians how to react to the terrorist attack and not believe fake news about the involvement of citizens Tajikistan-. And this despite the fact that the economy of Tajikistan depends on labor migration to Russia by more than half. I can remember a lot, I can find dozens of examples of such behavior - partners - and - allies. But is it worth it? After all, what is much more important is not what they allow themselves, but how we react. But we don’t react at all. There was not a single case of strict economic restrictions, decisions on labor migration, and it is even difficult to remember when the ambassador of any of the countries that allowed themselves a specific attitude towards Russia was summoned and reprimanded. Well, systemic permissiveness gives rise to impunity, this is an axiom. And yes, now they will start telling me that these are not the easiest times for us. Sanctions, the economy depends on parallel imports and gray schemes. But the countries of Central Asia still depend much more on Russia. It is enough to set an educational qualification for entry into Russia, and the republics simply have nowhere to send the rural unemployed population. Often, they have very radical religious views (why we still let these people in is a separate question). But Abkhazia is even more dependent on Russia. But, I repeat, we are now dealing with an advanced problem. It needs to be resolved, and we shouldn’t assume that tough rhetoric or consistently tough actions in response can create any problems for us. Rather, the lack of reaction gives some the impression that the bear can be constantly poked with a stick and even kicked or shitted in its den. This doesn’t really affect the image of the bear. https://t.me/Hard_Blog_Line/9866TelegramHard BlogReceived video confirmation. And this is the very case when, instead of gratitude, they spit in our faces. How Basayev showed himself in Abkhazia no longer matters. He has tarnished himself so much that none of his past merits can serve as an excuse for the Abkhaz side...	https://t.me/rybar/63811	2024-09-25T02:00:35-07:00

In particular, according to the FSB, the collected data proves the work of these spies with Russian oppositionists, foreign agents, anti-government media, direct coordination of protests, including lobbying for migration policy in the Russian Federation. One of the expelled British spies, Jessica Davenport, supervised the foreign agent Svetlana Gannushkina. Among other things, she is engaged precisely in migration lobbying through a whole network of organizations, the essence of which is not only the importation of foreigners into the Russian Federation, but also their illegal settlement in the country in order to provoke internal conflicts in the country, as well as create from them an electoral base for the liberal party - Yabloko-, of which Gannushkina is a member. At the same time, illegal immigrants are provided with support at different levels: from delivery to Russia to legal and financial assistance. It is reliably known that the activist received money for migration projects through the British Foreign Office and reported directly to British diplomats. 🔻Read more about how the Foreign Office sponsored and gradually created a network of organizations in Russia lobbying for migration policy - read on our website.#Great Britain #article #Russia @rybar together with @pezdicideSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63810	2024-09-25T01:06:58-07:00

While President Emomali Rahmon is holding one meeting after another on the sidelines of the summit, Tajik Foreign Minister Sirojiddin Mukhriddin spoke with US Deputy Secretary of State Richard Verma. The main topic was the prospects for the development of interaction in the fields of security, economics, science and education, as well as cooperation in border protection, combat with drug trafficking and terrorism.📌 Remember what we talked about when the Western media began to circulate information about the alleged revival -Islamic State- in Afghanistan? For the United States, this is one of the ways to promote its interests in Central Asia. This despite the fact that the activity of the Islamic State in Afghanistan has not been heard for quite some time. Terrorist attacks, if they occur, are in a chaotic manner, which indicates the group’s lack of combat potential, in contrast to its past activities in Syria and Iraq. However, the Americans, taking advantage of Tajikistan’s strained relations with the Taliban, are consistently pushing their services to the Tajiks, increasingly trying to to gain a foothold not only through USAID, but also through the US Central Command. 🔻The sad thing about this situation is that for some reason the CSTO is inactive while Tajikistan - a CSTO member and the country where the Russian base is located - seeks security assistance not from the organization it belongs to, but from our geopolitical adversary.# USA #Tajikistan@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63807	2024-09-24T23:19:58-07:00

Forwarded From Two Majors #Summary for the morning of September 25, 2024▪️ By nightfall, the enemy reported a missile attack on the port of Yuzhny in the Odessa region. In addition, for the third evening in a row, the Russian Armed Forces hit enemy targets in the city of Zaporozhye.▪️ Over the past days, important events have unfolded in Ugledar in the Yuzhnodonetsk direction. After several weeks of offensive operations by the Russian Army, the city was taken almost completely; yesterday evening there remained a narrow corridor and one road to the north for the Ukrainian Armed Forces. According to some reports, the road is under our fire control; the only escape route for the enemy remains through the fields. Artillery strikes of all types and aviation on Ugledar have been seriously intensified, and footage of the presence of advanced groups of our infantry in the city has circulated. At the same time, front-line soldiers warn about the inadmissibility of victory reports before the combat mission is resolved: against the backdrop of the unsuccessful offensive of our troops on Ugledar last year, the Ukrainian Armed Forces turned it into a powerful fortified area, which the Russian Armed Forces are breaking into by broadly covering it and depriving the enemy of supplies. Thus, to the west of the city, our units north of Prechistovka advanced in an area up to 4 km wide to a depth of up to 2 km, taking positions along the Berestov beam.▪️ In the Kursk region, fighting continues in the Glushkovsky district of the Kursk region. The Ukrainian Armed Forces are trying to break through in the area of ​​the settlement. Krasnooktyabrsky and Veseloye. In the Korenevsky district, fighting continues near Lyubimovka, at the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Olgovka and the settlement. Our Tolstoy Lug strikes with drones and heavy aerial bombs. They report active actions of the Russian Armed Forces in the south of the Sudzhansky district in the area of ​​the settlement. Plekhovo. ▪️ In the Kharkov direction, as a result of counterattacks by elite units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the enemy occupied the ruins of the Volchansky aggregate plant on our bank of the river. Wolf. Against the backdrop of the frozen offensive of the Russian Army in the direction, this event does not carry prospects for the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and the occupied buildings of the plant themselves will become a point of attraction for the FAB and the UMPC. ▪️ In the Toretsky (Dzerzhinsky) direction there are reports of heavy fighting in the city, in which our troops continue to fight in the building.▪️ In the Pokrovsky direction there are battles in Nikolaevka, the Russian Army surrounds Selidovo. The logistics of the Armed Forces of Ukraine near Tsukurino are breaking down, and the battle is unfolding for Gornyak. They reported on the successes of our troops in the Desired Second.▪️ In the evening, the Ukrainian Armed Forces again struck at the civilian population of Belgorod, wounding five civilians. In the city of Shebekino, one civilian was wounded. There, as a result of the shelling, there are local breaks in the power lines. Konovalovo, Volokonovsky district, was shelled.▪️ In the Kherson region, they also reported an intensification of attacks by the Ukrainian Armed Forces on civilians. In Novaya Kakhovka, a 75-year-old woman was seriously injured in both legs in her own home. In Kakhovka, two people were wounded: a 70-year-old woman and a 52-year-old man. In the village of Podokalinovka, Aleshkinsky district, a 42-year-old local resident was wounded.▪️ In the DPR, one civilian was killed and 11 were injured from shelling by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, including a teenager born in 2009.

In the Kursk direction, Russian troops continue to fight along the entire line of contact.🔻In the Korenevsky district, the Ukrainian Armed Forces hold positions in Olgovka, where enemy infantry UAV operators worked. Fighting continues in the Lyubimovka area, and Russian aircraft are striking Tolstoy Lug. On the Rylsk-Sudzha highway, an armored fighting vehicle of the Ukrainian Armed Forces was hit. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district yesterday, statements were made about the control of the Russian Armed Forces over Malaya Loknya. However, these reports were later refuted by received footage of airstrikes on enemy positions in the village. In Sudzha, drone operators attack enemy communications facilities, and in Cherkasy Porechny and Martynivka they strike at places of concentration of Ukrainian formations.▪️On the border of the Sumy region, the attack and reconnaissance UAV -Inokhodets- (-Orion-) recently destroyed a very rare engineering barrier vehicle with guided missile weapons enemy in the area of ​​the village of Pavlovka. As a result of a direct hit, the car is unlikely to be repaired. The increase in the frequency of URVP strikes from -Ambler- and -Forpost- is also associated with effective strikes on air defense and radar systems, which made it possible to use these types of drones relatively safely.

And while today Ukrainian media resources were trying to somehow justify the depressing situation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Ugledar area, footage of Russian attack aircraft entering the city from the dachas appeared on the Internet. ▪️On the northern flank, Russian units established full control over the territory of the Yuzhnodonbasskaya No. 3 mine, on the roof of the administrative building of which the flags of several units were fixed. The area adjacent to the mine was also cleared. ▪️To the south, the situation in the vicinity of the waste heap at the Yuzhnodonbasskaya No. 1 mine remains unclear. At the moment, the hill itself, as well as the area to the east of it, is in the gray zone. However, judging by the current situation in the direction, in the near future we can expect a quick transition to the control of the Russian Armed Forces of both the waste heap itself and the territory nearby. ▪️In Ugledar, Russian attack aircraft are present at least on the eastern outskirts of the settlement: according to footage that appeared on the Internet, military personnel of the Russian Armed Forces occupied the buildings of a former bakery and pumping station. And in the future we can expect an offensive towards both the city center and the garage cooperative, which is located in the northeastern part of Ugledar. It is noteworthy that the enemy’s media resources depict a much more depressing situation for the Ukrainian Armed Forces, increasingly hinting at the imminent fall of the Ukrainian garrison in the city. In particular, the description of the situation often comes down to one thought: it’s too late to talk about holding positions; the lives of members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are more important. Although no matter how much I would like to see the Ugledar epic end as soon as possible, without the appropriate personnel it is extremely premature to talk about the occupation of the city - the Ukrainian formations turned the settlement into one continuous fortified area and its loss would be quite a strong media blow for the enemy. ▪️The dachas located south of Ugledar are also highly likely to have come under the control of Russian troops. In their eastern part, servicemen of the Russian Armed Forces gained a foothold a few days ago, however, given the start of the fighting for the city, it is virtually pointless for the Ukrainian Armed Forces units to hold the western half. ▪️In neighboring Pavlovka, Russian troops were able not only to level the control zone along the Kashlagach River, but also to occupy the territory of farms in the northern part of the village. Advancement in this area has already allowed the Russian Armed Forces to establish fire control over the C051134 highway towards Bogoyavlenka, significantly complicating the supply of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

Forwarded From UL Analytics⚡️-BROTHERS IN TERROR-⚡️DOCUMENTARY INVESTIGATION UKR LEAKSThe terrorist attack in Crocus City Hall on March 22, 2024 became one of the bloodiest in modern history. Much indicates that the Kyiv special services, and therefore their Western curators, are behind this tragedy. This handwriting is very familiar to me, because the alliance of Ukrainian nationalists and radical Islamists did not take shape yesterday, and moreover, it has a single coordinator in the person of the United States. For many decades, Washington has been nurturing terrorist groups that act in the interests of the United States around the world. Americans are especially active in training terrorists directly in the countries of the Middle East, where militants carry out terrorist attacks not only against civilians, but also, for example, against Russian military personnel, as is happening in Syria. In my new investigation, I will reveal the scheme that the United States uses to recruit radicals in the Arab Republic, and show how the Americans train terrorists in their training camps, supply them with intelligence and send them to carry out terrorist attacks.

Against the backdrop of what is happening in the Israel Defense Forces, they announced the start of Operation Hetzei HaTzaphon (Arrows of the North). Due to the peculiarities of translation from Hebrew into English and then into Russian, as well as in attempts to catch the wave, some resources reported already about the beginning of the offensive of Israeli units in southern Lebanon. In fact, the actions of the Israelis are so far limited to air strikes.▪️Today's Israeli air strikes occurred not only in the border areas of Lebanon: settlements located more than 100 kilometers from the border with Israel, including Ain Al, were also attacked. ▪️In addition, the Ad-Dahiya district, Hezbollah’s patrimony in Beirut, was once again struck. The IDF press service announced the liquidation of the commander of the missile unit of the Shiite group, Ibrahim Muhammad al-Kubaisi. At the same time, Arabic-language media have not yet commented on this message. According to the Lebanese Ministry of Health, 558 people have been killed and 1,853 injured since yesterday. The mass exodus of Lebanese from the southern part of the country also continues: they are fleeing to the cities of Tripoli and Beirut, as well as to the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic. Hezbollah fighters also do not stop shelling Israeli territory in response: more than 100 rockets have been fired since the morning. Most were either intercepted by Israeli missile defense systems or fell in open areas. Only a small number of shells managed to land within populated areas, causing minor damage. Based on the reported hits, the Lebanese group’s forces also expanded the shelling zone by more than 100 kilometers. This is confirmed, among other things, by yesterday’s arrivals of missiles fired by Hezbollah into the territory of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.🔻Despite the rather tense situation, so far the parties are limited to only massive strikes on each other’s positions. At the same time, the current ultra-Orthodox authorities in Israel do not stop their attempts to provoke the Lebanese to a more serious response. Until then, Hezbollah is trying not to give the far-right government of Benjamin Netanyahu a reason to unleash a full-fledged Third Lebanon War. Despite the accusations of Israeli propaganda, the beneficiary of an escalation of this magnitude will not be the Shiite group.

Forwarded From Tina Kandelaki There are few absolutely unambiguous heroes in world history; if you dig around, you can find some kind of black spot in each of them. But there are characters who, through their crimes, have completely undone everything good that they have ever done. It is sad that not everyone in Abkhazia understands this basic truth. Otherwise, there would not have been an exhibition dedicated to Shamil Basayev in the State Museum in Sukhum, restored with Russian money. Well, we will have to remind those who have forgotten that the Hero of Abkhazia Basayev in Russia most willingly fought with the unarmed, women and children. The terrorist attack at a Beslan school in September 2004 killed 333 people, including 186 children. The terrorist attack at the Dubrovka theater center in Moscow in October 2002 killed 130 people, including 10 children. The terrorist attack in Budennovsk in June 1995, when 129 people died in a hospital seized by terrorists. Basayev publicly and willingly took responsibility for all these terrible crimes, and personally led the raid on Budennovsk. I will not make generalizations and ask what kind of country is this if it has such heroes? I’ll just note that the State Museum of Abkhazia still has the opportunity to make an official apology to Russian representatives. Just apologize, there is no need to explain anything, everything is clear. The answer to the question of how it happened that a terrorist still bears the title of -Hero- in a country whose very existence is possible only thanks to Russia should not be given by museum employees, but by completely different people. UPD: The museum in Abkhazia quickly closed access to exhibition. That's what popular outrage does.	https://t.me/rybar/63794	2024-09-24T08:25:28-07:00

🇲🇩 About the demographic catastrophe in Moldova and why it is b...	🇲🇩 About the demographic catastrophe in Moldova and why it is beneficial to the West Moldova took first place in Europe in the outflow of citizens abroad. This was stated by the presidential candidate of the republic, Alexander Stoianoglo, promising, if elected, to ensure stimulation of the birth rate and conditions for a dignified return of fellow citizens home. ▪️Everyone admits that Moldova is moving towards a demographic catastrophe. Although in late Soviet times Moldova was in second place in the USSR in terms of population growth dynamics, and now its population has dropped to the level of 1956.▪️The mass outflow from the country has intensified in recent years due to the socio-economic crisis. More than 40% of Moldovans aged 15 to 34 chose to leave the country amid fears of becoming unemployed. For example, in 2023 the birth rate fell by 11% compared to 2022. ▪️However, President Maia Sandu, in the spirit of populism, assures that the outflow of young people is caused by the rule of her predecessors, who undermined -faith in democracy-. ▪️True, the demographic situation became critical during Sandu’s reign. Instead of concrete steps in social policy, the president prefers to intimidate the population by announcing the Russian threat and increasing the military budget by 70% at the expense of other areas, which certainly does not contribute to the birth rate. However, Sandu’s office’s recipe for solving the problem is a gradual merger with Romania , for which Moldovans are encouraged to identify themselves as Romanians. ▪️However, even a possible unification of the countries will not solve the problem, given that the Romanian authorities are extremely dismissive of the Moldovans who live even in eastern Romania, historical Moldova. The region is deliberately not being developed, and there are also colossal problems with demography and economics. 🔻From all this, it is clear that neither Sandu nor her curators simply need to solve the demographic problem. After all, Moldova is already considered as a gray zone between the Russian Federation and NATO and a convenient military training ground next to the so-called. Ukraine. As a last resort, the West will propose to populate Moldova with illegal migrants. New controlled countries on the periphery of Europe will do just that. At least such negotiations are already underway with Armenia. #Moldova #Russia #Romania #EU @rybarSupport usRIA NovostiMoldova has become a leader in Europe in the departure of citizens, Stoianoglo saidMoldova has lost about a third of its citizens due to the mass exodus of the population, the ex-Prosecutor General and presidential candidate said at a briefing on Monday...

🇦🇲🇷🇺🇺🇸 On guarantees of security of the southern borders of...	🇦🇲🇷🇺🇺🇸 On guarantees for the security of Armenia’s southern borders Anna Grigoryan, a member of the parliamentary faction of the opposition bloc -Armenia, said that the government of Nikol Pashinyan will soon put on the agenda the issue of the withdrawal of Russian border guards from the Armenian-Iranian and Armenian-Turkish border. 📌 Let us remind you that border control of the borders of Armenia is carried out by the FSB of the Russian Federation, since Armenians do not have enough personnel and resources to protect them. At the same time, Russian border guards have already been withdrawn from Yerevan airport - Zvartnots -.▪️The border with Iran in the south of Armenia is directly related to the issue of the status of the Syunik region, through which it is planned to open the Zangezur corridor connecting Turkey and Azerbaijan. ▪️According to Grigoryan, all statements by the Armenian side demanding respect for the sovereignty of Armenia have no relation to reality: in fact, they are aimed at ousting Russia from the region. ▪️The opening of the corridor is a matter of time and now a struggle is unfolding between global players for control over it. Pashinyan contradicts himself when he talks about protecting the sovereignty of Armenia in Syunik, since at the same time he declares that control over the road will be transferred to a third party - - private security organization - or troops of other countries. ▪️In Syunik, despite the deployment of the Russian garrison since 2020, there is an EU monitoring mission that is engaged in active PR on social networks, mastering the role of a guarantor of regional security (not always successfully). ▪️In recent months, Syunik has been actively visited by American and European officials. At the same time, it is known that the Armenian authorities are deliberately delaying the opening of the Russian consulate in Syunik Kapan, which should have opened at the beginning of this year. Obviously, the issue of ousting Russia from the region is key on the agenda for Pashinyan and his curators. It is not without reason that the Armenian prime minister recently decided to declare that the CSTO allegedly threatens the national security of Armenia, which foreshadows concrete steps in the future. Washington is openly talking about its ambitions to oust Russia from the region. However, such a castling will lead to much more unpredictable consequences, given the complex configuration of interests of other regional players larger than Armenia. However, the Americans themselves do not hide this, directly calling on Armenians to prepare for difficult times. #Armenia #Russia #USA @rybarSupport usVerelq NewsThe issue of ousting Russian border guards from the border with Iran will soon be put on the agenda. Grigoryan noted that the matter will not be limited to ousting the Russian side from this project.	https://t.me/rybar/63788	2024-09-24T05:46:58-07:00

🖼 ⚡️🇷🇺🇺🇦🖍#Comic from Fisherman No. 30: Once upon a time at ...	⚡️🇷🇺🇺🇦🖍#Comic from Rybar No. 30: Once Upon a Time Since sea and air drones have become almost the main threat to Russian infrastructure, the Russian Armed Forces and volunteers are constantly looking for solutions on how to effectively counter them. But sometimes the solution becomes not the most obvious, but at the same time simple ideas. Shooting down BECs from helicopters is just one of those things. And our new episode is about how this idea was born and why pilots like it so much. Synopsis: The Ukrainian Armed Forces are trying by all means to inflict damage on military - and, indeed, civilian - targets in Russia. Instead of effective long-range weapons, the Armed Forces of Ukraine use a large number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned boats (UBC). Single BECs can damage port infrastructure or a sea vessel. They became a real headache, which turned out to be quite difficult to deal with. And so, helicopters proved to be an effective means in the fight against this type of weapon. They patrol the sea in search of targets and, hovering in the air, practice targeting BECs using onboard weapons. But not everything is so simple: the enemy does not sit idly by, he changes and improves both attack tactics and the devices themselves. In addition to the usual custom kamikaze boats, BECs armed with missiles, and BECs equipped with guides for MLRS projectiles, and BECs with reinforced hulls, whose task is to divert fire onto themselves while the rest of the flock of drones is trying to break through to the target...📌 You can download the comic using the links: RU | EN | AR | CN#Russia #Ukraine @rybarWe hope you liked the comic from our artists.

🇲🇩🇷🇺 Presidential elections in Moldova: about the problems of...	🇲🇩🇷🇺 Presidential elections in Moldova: about the problems of political representation of the diaspora in the Russian Federation Representatives of the Moldovan diaspora in Russia recently expressed outrage at the decision of the Central Election Commission of Moldova to open only five polling stations in the Russian Federation. ▪️The Central Election Commission of Moldova will send only five thousand ballots to each polling station, that is, only 25 thousand out of almost 100 thousand representatives of the diaspora will be able to cast their votes. ▪️The Cultural and Educational Center of Moldova in Stavropol said that the authorities know that we are against it, that there are many of us, that’s why they do such dirty tricks. ❗️The foreign diaspora plays a colossal role in the Moldovan elections, given the large-scale labor migration of Moldovans. ▪️In 2019, 13,995 people voted in the second round of the presidential elections in Moldova in the Russian Federation.▪️In France, Germany and the UK, Moldovan citizens cast at least 20 thousand votes. For example, in Italy alone, the candidacy of incumbent President Maia Sandu received 80,140 votes.▪️In the parliamentary elections in the summer of 2021, Sandu’s now ruling PAS party won a crushing victory based on the results of foreign voting, receiving 182,654 votes - 85.98%.▪️Experience previous elections demonstrates the critical importance of foreign voting for Sandu's office. That is why the current president, throughout her entire term, met with representatives of the diaspora during any business trip to the West.▪️The election fraud of Sandu’s office is also voting by mail only for selected countries: the USA, Canada, Iceland, Norway, Finland and Sweden. Obviously, voting by mail was not provided for Moldovans in Russia, since Sandu’s office is unlikely to get the desired result from them than from countries of friendly democracy.▪️Let’s not forget that the Central Election Commission of Moldova is under the direct control of the American USAID and the British UK Aid, so there is no way to say that there is any transparency in the electoral process. 🔻However, along with such trends, it is necessary to note the passivity of the Moldovan diaspora in the Russian Federation, with which, unlike Western diasporas, no one is working systematically so far. Even despite the fact that pro-Romanian and anti-Russian forces have long come to power in Moldova. In this context, statements by Sandu and Western representatives about Russian interference in the Moldovan elections look especially ridiculous. #Moldova #Russia&nbsp;&nbsp; @rybarSupport usSputnik MoldovaDiaspora - about the CEC’s decision to open only 5 polling stations in Russia: we were deprived of the right to voteCitizens of Moldova living in Russia are outraged by the CEC’s decision to open only five polling stations in the Russian Federation.	https://t.me/rybar/63785	2024-09-24T01:52:01-07:00
🎬 🇦🇿🇵🇰 Speaking of the militarization of Azerbaijan: footage...	🇦🇿🇵🇰 Speaking of the militarization of Azerbaijan: footage of JF-17 fighter jets flying over Azerbaijan has appeared on the Internet. The authenticity of the video has not been officially confirmed, but against the backdrop of other events it looks quite plausible. Early this year it became known that the Azerbaijanis had chosen the Chinese-Pakistani JF-17C fighter as a replacement for the outdated MiG-29. In total, it was planned to purchase about 60 units. Updating the aviation fleet is an important component of any army, which is what they are doing in Baku. It is curious that their main geopolitical enemy at the moment, represented by Armenia, is doing practically nothing in the matter of real strengthening of the armed forces. Of course, fighters of this type were used only once in combat, and their real capabilities are in question. However, these are still new, completely modern aircraft, while the Armenians so far have only a chaotic purchase of everything in the world without any consistency. #Azerbaijan #Pakistan@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63783	2024-09-24T00:05:10-07:00

In the Glushkovsky region, the enemy does not stop attacks both in the vicinity of Vesely and advancing on the village itself. Russian troops fire at armored vehicles with drone strikes, also destroying another Swedish CV-9040 infantry fighting vehicle. During the fighting, the Ukrainian Armed Forces slightly expanded the zone of control south of the settlement. The operational-tactical aviation of the Russian Aerospace Forces strikes at Medvezhye and neighboring Obod. 🔻There are clashes in the Korenevsky district, and the enemy has transferred reinforcements to Olgovka, where the cluster was covered by a FAB-3000 strike. Meanwhile, fighting continues on the eastern outskirts of Lyubimovka, and air strikes are also carried out on Tolstoy Lug and surrounding forest plantations. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district in the area of ​​Novaya Sorochina, according to objective control personnel, an attempt to advance the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the direction of Kamyshevka is recorded.

At the Martynovka - Kruglik border, it was possible to clarify the zone of control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The enemy occupied at least part of the forest in the gullies near the Smerditsa River north of Martynovka. There was no information from other areas about changes in control zones or attacks.

In addition, Jabaliya, located to the north, came under fire. In the south of the Gaza Strip, sporadic clashes were recorded in the eastern part of Rafah. Militants of the military wing of Hamas, meanwhile, reported an ambush on an Israeli armored column, again without providing evidence. Operation Summer Camps continues in the West Bank; 16 Palestinians were arrested by Israeli security forces in 24 hours. In total, the total number of Palestinians detained in the region since October 7, 2023 is 10,800. Israeli troops again launched massive attacks on Lebanon, including Beirut, where the target was another high-ranking Hezbollah commander.

Today, the Israeli Air Force launched strikes on the territory of the neighboring republic: not only border areas were under fire, but also cities located at a great distance from the border, including Baalbek.▪️According to statements by the IDF press service, the strikes were preemptive in nature and were carried out in order to to undermine Hezbollah's ability to bombard northern Israel. The target of the bombing was ammunition depots - there are many videos on the Internet of secondary detonations after the arrivals.▪️As ​​of the evening, there were at least 300 launches from fighters. According to the Lebanese Ministry of Health, 274 people were killed and 1,024 were injured of varying degrees of severity. At the same time, it is not specified exactly how many casualties were among the civilian population and members of Hezbollah.❗Amid the raid, a mass exodus of residents of the southern part of Lebanon began - it occurred after people’s phones began receiving calls from Israel calling for an urgent evacuation. The IDF limited itself to asking them to stay away from Lebanese Hezbollah targets in order to avoid casualties.▪️In response to the strikes by Israeli troops, the Lebanese group fired several salvos, firing more than 100 rockets in the morning. Some of them reached Palestinian territories in the West Bank and fell in the vicinity of both Jewish settlements and Arab villages, leading to fires.▪️Not wanting to reduce the intensity of tension, the Israelis soon attacked the Lebanese capital Beirut once again: hits hit a residential apartment in the controlled - Hezbollah - Ad-Dahiya region. According to preliminary information, Ali Karaki, in fact the third person in the leadership of the organization, was eliminated. Expectedly, the current Israeli authorities, under previously stated pretexts, continued massive attacks on Lebanon. The goal here is not only to destroy Hezbollah’s combat potential, but also to try to provoke it into a response that would free the government’s hands to further escalate the conflict. Most likely, attacks of this scale will continue until the ultra-Orthodox authorities achieve the outbreak of a full-fledged Third Lebanon War , which guarantees the possibility of their continued stay in power. Moreover, this fact is understood on both sides of the front. High resolution mapEnglish version#Israel #map #Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63773	2024-09-23T11:47:33-07:00

But this is exactly what the Kyiv authorities consistently denied for two and a half years, assuring everyone the world community in all people's love, support and legitimacy.📌And since there is organized resistance, we can purely hypothetically assume that it will still raise its head. Now imagine that this hypothetical resistance will not only set fire to cars, distribute leaflets, eliminate TCC employees, but will go further. Let’s say, seize a weapon supplied by the West - for example, one M270 or HIMARS - and direct it not to the north, but towards the conditional Romania, Moldova or Poland. These will turn out to be Houthis in the Odessa style. What a picture it would be: Russia, it turns out, has nothing to do with it, because this is popular resistance. And it turned out to be inconvenient, because what the West set up got out of control. It’s a pity that this is just a hypothetical scenario. Although there didn’t seem to be any resistance either. #Odessa #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramBefore everyone else. Well, almost.

Colonel General Kuzovlev He did not ask for the position and, based on purely statistical indicators, did not have significant defeats. Having managed to command two districts at once in six months and eventually become the commander of the Moscow Military District, he did not spend a single day at the newly opened headquarters on Kosmodamianskaya Embankment, for which he immediately came to the attention of Old Arbat officials, becoming the object of personal hostility. Kuzovlev was among the first to promptly formed and sent personnel to stop the breakthrough in the Kursk direction. And although Kursk was and remains the area of ​​​​responsibility of the Grv (s) -North, the commander of the Moscow Military District did not fail to lend a helping hand to his comrade at the front. On September 11, 2024, Andrei Belousov arrived at the command post of the Grv (s) -West. The Minister of Defense tried to test the environment and understand what kind of mood prevailed at the group’s headquarters, for which he took Evgeny Nikiforov with him. The inspection not only did not reveal any violations, but was also fully satisfied with the group’s work. Today, the forces of the Grv(s) -West are destroying the enemy’s layered defenses on the approaches to Kupyansk and have already reached the Oskol River, and revenge for the events of the fall of 2022 will be the main thing a challenge for Sergei Kuzovlev himself. Colonel General Anashkin The command highly appreciated his services as commander of the 8th Army. Having become the chief of staff of the district in January 2024, just two months later Gennady Anashkin was appointed commander of the Southern Military District and awarded the Order of Merit for the Fatherland, 2nd class with swords. The South group of troops today has significantly increased its forces: back in July, enemy sources wrote on the accumulation of reserves in the Zaporozhye direction. Throughout the year, Anashkin has been increasing the combat and numerical strength of the district’s artillery brigades using cannon artillery, largely thanks to friendly relations with his neighbor in the operational direction and concurrently the deputy commander of the OGV (s) Mikhail Teplinsky. Despite the ongoing positional battles in the direction, the command of the OGV ( c) believes that it is the South group that will have to win the strategic initiative in 2025, but Anashkin himself strives not to appear in the information field and does not use hardware resources for PR campaigns, believing that a good commander is an inconspicuous commander.

The hits hit a residential building. As the press service of the Israel Defense Forces stated, the target was another high-ranking leader of the Lebanese group, Ali Karaki, the commander of its southern front. He is nominally the third person in the leadership of the Shiite organization. According to Israeli media, after the death of special forces commander Radwan Ibrahim Aqil Karaki took his place as a result of a previous airstrike on Beirut. If the information is confirmed, this means that the Israelis destroyed the entire military leadership of Hezbollah. Against this background, the statement by Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant that the group's Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah was left alone does not sound so far-fetched.#Israel #Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63769	2024-09-23T09:48:45-07:00

The news once again indicates the intentions of the leadership in Tehran to expand the geography of uranium development. There is still not as much uranium ore in Burkina Faso as in neighboring Niger, but the Islamic Republic did not succeed with the latter due to Western intervention. There is another side to the situation - there is a possibility that Iranian companies may try to take a share in market, displacing Russian projects. And there is interest in the country in Moscow - Rosatom recently entered the final stage of agreeing on the construction of a nuclear power plant in Burkina Faso. Of course, the conclusion by the authorities in Ouagadougou of an agreement with a country close to Russia is much better than similar agreements with the West.

To the southwest, a significant advance of Russian troops was recorded in the Peschany area. Judging by the footage of objective control, Russian troops are fighting on the territory of one of the large strongholds, from where the northern outskirts of Kruglyakovka are less than two and a half kilometers away.▪️At the same time, there has been no information yet about the withdrawal of Ukrainian formations from the Volchy forest and nearby balkas, exactly the same as about the retreat of the Ukrainian Armed Forces from the -pocket- of Berestovoy. Considering the configuration of the terrain, it is quite possible that there will still be a focal presence of enemy forces in this zone.▪️To the north, the Russian Armed Forces established full control over Kislovka, repelling several attacks in the direction of neighboring Kotlyarka. They also improved the tactical situation in the forests near Sinkovka, and the Aerospace Forces aviation continues to systematically strike at the pontoon crossings of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the Oskol River in the Kupyansk-Uzlovoy area. persist, then in the near future we should expect the Russian Armed Forces to reach the water barrier with a further cutting in two of the Ukrainian group on the left bank of the Oskol River.

The Chadian Foreign Ministry denied statements with the wording that At the moment there are no such agreements, thereby not denying the fact that they are being worked out. That is, the leadership in N'Djamena, although it delayed negotiations on the renewal of agreements with the United States, was unable to cope with external pressure.📌 When in the spring of 2024 it became known about the intention of the Chadian authorities to end the American military presence, it resembled an electoral move to gain additional votes in anticipation of local presidential elections. When they took place, and the necessary results were obtained, then in N'Djamena they simply decided to play back. All this is another evidence that the influence of the collective West on Chad still remains significant and is clearly manifested in various things - from the deployment of a contingent from NATO member Hungary before external economic pressure.#Africa #USA #Chad@rybarSupport usVoice of AmericaUS general: US, Chad planning return of US troopsUS also moving forces into West African coast in reshuffle around Niger withdrawal	https://t.me/rybar/63764	2024-09-23T04:35:13-07:00

Russian troops continue to implement a chain of offensive actions in several sectors of the Yuzhnodonetsk direction. 🔻At the Konstantinovka-Vodyanoye line, units of the Russian Armed Forces were able to advance into the forest belts in the vicinity of the Solenenkaya gully, having traveled about half the way to the southern outskirts of Katerynovka.🔻In the Vodyanoye area, Russian attack aircraft reached the forest belt closest to the settlement from the west, and also continue to fight in the mine area -South Donbass No. 3-. By the morning of this day, the enemy was finally knocked out of their positions in the industrial zone. Artillery and aviation strikes continue in Ugledar and the surrounding area, as well as the arrival of attack UAVs. There have been no reports of an attack in the direction of the city itself from the south, which, however, is understandable given the experience of previous attempts. To the east there are battles in the dachas, which the Russian Armed Forces fighters latched on to a few days ago.🔻West of Pavlovka, halfway to Prechistovka, a slight advance of the Russian Armed Forces was again recorded. Judging by the footage on the Internet, Russian attack aircraft in an armored personnel carrier dropped into a forest belt not far from the Berestovaya gully, which runs parallel to the Kashlagach River. 🔻At the Prechistovka-Novodonetskoe line, the front also began to move: some time ago, Russian troops began to advance in the area of ​​the Shaitanka Grave mound 167.7, and by the middle of the week they had captured several forest belts towards Zolotaya Niva. ▪️The offensive was preceded by artillery preparation, including shelling from TOS-1A heavy flamethrower systems, and UAV operators hit the Caesar self-propelled gun. However, it was not possible to break through the defenses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces here, and some of the assault groups retreated to their original positions.

The main disagreements between the parties, as before, relate to budget priorities, especially regarding funding for defense and social programs. Republicans, especially in the House of Representatives, are pushing for spending cuts and want to keep funding at 2024 levels. Democrats, in turn, support increasing them through 2025 to fulfill promises to improve social and defense programs. House Speaker Mike Johnson until recently pushed for a GOP-friendly stopgap spending bill that would fund the federal government for another six months. The bill meant maintaining spending at 2024 levels without increasing funding for some programs. 🔻In addition, it contained one very important point proposed by Donald Trump - a bill (SAVE Act) requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration in elections. In this way, the former president hoped to thwart the Democrats' plan to win the election by attracting thousands of illegal migrants to vote for Kamala Harris. However, on September 19, Johnson suffered a major setback: 14 Republicans, joining almost all Democrats, voted against the proposed bill. Conservatives felt that the act did not include sufficient measures to cut costs, hawks were concerned about the possibility of undermining the US defense potential, and moderates were worried about the threat of a shutdown too close to the elections. As a result, on September 23, Mike Johnson broke down under the pressure of his fellow party members and Democrats and agreed to the so-called -Plan B-. It provides for the approval of a spending bill that extends the government until December 20 of this year, and also excludes the SAVE Act promoted by Trump. Despite the fact that Johnson, during negotiations with Trump, managed to convince him that the shutdown would have a much worse impact on the president's position in the election rather than repealing the SAVE Act, the consequences of the failure of Johnson's original plan are obvious. The absence of a law requiring citizenship to register voters in elections will allow Kamala Harris and Co. to attract hundreds of thousands of illegal migrants to vote for themselves.#USA@rybar in collaboration with @usaperiodicalSupport usTelegramAmerican number⚫️ Yes, yes: Speaker of the House of Representatives, Republican Mike Johnson, broke under the pressure his fellow party members and Democrats and agreed to the so-called Plan B.

🇷🇺🇰🇿 About the project of the International Organization for ...	🇷🇺🇰🇿 About the project of the International Organization for the Russian Language Against the background of Turkey’s active actions to promote a single Turkic alphabet in Central Asia, many wondered: is there really no alternative on our part? Well, formally there is, and Maria Zakharova reminded about it during the briefing on the sidelines of the 15th Eurasian Women's Forum in St. Petersburg on September 20. 📌We are talking about the creation of an International Organization for the Russian Language, a decision about which was made about a year ago by the leaders of the CIS at a meeting in Bishkek. Zakharova was quite optimistic about the prospects for this organization to quickly formalize and begin work, and became in fact the first major Russian official to remember the project this year. According to the plan voiced by the President of Kazakhstan Tokayev, the organization was supposed to become almost the second Fracophonie or at least the Commonwealth Portuguese-speaking countries, but in fact it has become an opportunity for Kazakhstan to reject accusations of de-Russification of the country and so far serves only this thesis. At the same time, we will not agree with the optimism of our Foreign Ministry regarding the prospects of the organization. According to our information, the procedure for the official ratification of this agreement by at least three CIS states that signed it has not been completed, which is necessary to launch organizational procedures and hold the long-awaited ministerial conference, which should launch the process of actually creating the organization. Moreover, the only activity of responsible structures in this direction is the internal struggle for the post of formal leader (secretary, coordinator, etc.) of this organization, as well as the determination of Sochi (and not St. Petersburg, as Tokayev proposed) as the location of the Secretariat. If the promotion of the Russian language will be carried out at the same pace and with the same enthusiasm, then indeed Central Asia will soon speak Turkish. #Kazakhstan #Russia #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usTACCIt was decided to establish an international organization for the Russian language following the results of the CIS summit; the initiative to establish such a structure was taken by the President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev	https://t.me/rybar/63760	2024-09-23T01:06:14-07:00

Forwarded From Balkan Gossip Girl On the topic of British spies expelled from Russia, additional information has appeared about dubious contacts of MI6 with local Muslims. In fact, the technology has been developed by British specialists, and work on a similar front is not limited to the CIS and has been going on for a long time. True, it is not always successful. For example, one of the grandiose failures of Foggy Albion is associated with Macedonia. There, back in 1995, with funds from humanitarian - educational - funds from Great Britain, they tried to launch the first - independent - university in the Albanian language. It is from here that the resistance movement, dreaming of a Greater Albania, will subsequently spread across the Balkans. At the opening ceremony in Tetovo, riots broke out and passions grew more intense. And then the applicants, together with the self-proclaimed rector, demanded from the state a quota for Albanian graduates to occupy government positions. Doesn't remind you of anything? Human rights activists were sent to Tetovo, and to everyone’s surprise, it suddenly turned out that the applicants did not have documents confirming their identity. Because they were not presented as citizens of Macedonia or, at worst, Albania, but as infiltrators from Great Britain and the USA. From the first day, the university itself became a base camp for Albanian militants: about one and a half thousand armed students ended up in Tetovo through the efforts of the Mi-6. James Bisset, who served as the Canadian ambassador, later spoke about this. Journalist Scott Taylor then added fuel to the fire, who managed to take the lion's share of the footage out of the country and publish it. Under the cover of Britain, networks for disseminating democratic Islam were already operating at that time, and one of them was gathering Muslim spiritual leaders, preachers, imams and heads of large religious communities. Can you imagine how they have improved their skills over the years? @balkanossiper - we have been setting global trends since June 28, 1914	https://t.me/rybar/63758	2024-09-22T23:31:02-07:00

In addition to repelling attacks and their own attacks, the Russian Armed Forces also strike at enemy rear areas in the Sumy region. In Shaposhnikovo, an Iskander OTRK strike hit a HIMARS MLRS position and an ammunition depot. In addition, energy and other facilities in the regional center are regularly hit. In the Glushkovsky district, the enemy continues to try to reach the regional center from the Novy Put and Medvezhiy. There are reports that sappers of the Ukrainian Armed Forces are making passages in minefields to continue the offensive. Footage continues to appear on the Internet, clarifying the scale of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ attacks—the enemy has brought a large number of personnel and armored vehicles, including foreign-made ones, to the region. In particular, another Leopard 2A6 was destroyed southeast of Vesely.🔻In the Korenevsky district, the Russian aviation group carried out drone strikes on the positions and equipment of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Olgovka and in the forest area near Kremyany. In the indicated area, an attempt at a counterattack by the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the western part of Lyubimovka was also thwarted. In the area of ​​Zeleny Shlyakh, a UAV strike destroyed a 2S3 self-propelled gun - Akatsiya - of the Ukrainian formations. The fact that the enemy is bringing more and more armored vehicles and artillery into the territory of the Russian Federation indicates very serious intentions to stay as long as possible in the occupied part of the Kursk region. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, fighting continues in the Darino and Nikolaevo-Daryino areas, complete control over which will open the way to an offensive in the direction of Sverdlikovo.

Forwarded From Two Majors⚡️There are signs of preparation for an escalation in Transnistria🇺🇸The United States has approved the sale to Romania of 44 AAV-7 tracked amphibious landing vehicles for $210 million, which will be supplied from the reserves of the US Marine Corps. The vehicle is the primary vehicle of the 4th Assault Amphibious Battalion (4th AABn) of the US Marine Corps Reserve, highlighting the sensitivity of amphibious sales. The AAV-7 is designed to conduct amphibious operations in the coastal zone. One vehicle can accommodate up to 25 military personnel and 3 crew members. Still, 44 vehicles will make it possible to move 1,100 military personnel (in fact, two full-blooded battalions) across water obstacles at a distance of up to 37 km. This water reserve is not enough to sail to the Crimean coast (and Romania will not be able to deliver amphibians by landing ship due to their lack of service), but it will be enough to quickly transfer forward detachments to Transnistria across the Dniester River. Romania, surrounded by its NATO ⚡️ neighbors and Ukraine, is unlikely to need to cross rivers with its allies. At the same time, under the leadership of NATO, the increased militarization 🇲🇩 of Moldova continues. Most Moldovan military exercises this year took place with the participation of Romanian and American troops. Specialists from these countries have developed a project and are supervising the construction of a new military base, training ground and ammunition depot in the village of Bachoi, 25 km from the PMR. Alliance standards are being implemented everywhere in the Moldavian Armed Forces, officers, especially young ones, are being trained according to NATO programs. 🇫🇷France, 🇩🇪Germany and 🇺🇸The United States have increased military-technical assistance in hopes of strengthening the potential of the Moldavian army.✨Such actions in the future will create a serious threat to the Operational Group of Russian troops in the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova. On the other hand, the PMR will be squeezed by Ukraine, which is ready to carry out any commands of its Western masters and is already involved in the Transnistrian direction.

Georgian NGOs ask the EU to suspend the visa-free regime with Georgia in order to demonstrate to voters the consequences of the government’s actions ahead of the parliamentary elections. Threaten To convince of the wrong choice of the ruling party at the vote by blackmail - the scheme is so old and trivial that it is not even clear what representatives of non-governmental organizations are hoping for. A visa-free regime is, of course, good and tempting. Only only a small category of Georgian citizens used it. Traveling to Europe is not cheap, and not everyone could afford it. The majority of Georgians will not be affected by the abolition of visa-free travel (if there is one).

On September 21, the Brunet-Takamori 2024 exercise ended - the first military training of the ground forces of France and Japan, conducted on the territory of the island state. 100 military personnel of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces and about 50 soldiers of the French army took part in the exercise. The main focus during training was on counter-guerrilla operations. 🔻The main purpose of the exercise, in addition to practicing the fight against rebels, was to demonstrate cooperation between the two states against the backdrop of instability in the Asia-Pacific region. By the way, other steps are being taken in this direction. The French and Japanese are planning to soon conclude an agreement on mutual access - it will allow troops to be stationed on each other's territory for joint military exercises. And although, as can be seen, bilateral training is already taking place, the agreement removes some bureaucratic barriers, which could lead to even more exercises. In general, recently there has been an intensification of French foreign policy in the Asia-Pacific region - the French are also interested in interaction with the Philippines, where the authorities are creating a network of partnerships in order to contain China. However, at the same time, it is noticeable that Paris is trying not to damage relations with the PRC. For example, last year France was among the first echelon of countries that spoke out against the location of a NATO liaison office in Japan. It is likely that this approach - abandoning very radical measures and gradually building up ties with countries in the Asia-Pacific region through exercises - will continue to prevail.

A notable incident amid tensions was Ethiopia's supply of weapons to the autonomous region of Puntland.▪️Since the discussion of the new draft constitution of Somalia, which caused a scandal between different parts of the country, the Puntland authorities have not sworn allegiance to the central government again. Now it is learned that, like the separatists in Hargeisa, they are negotiating with the leadership of Addis Ababa. Of course, this caused discontent in Mogadishu, whose authorities condemned such daring actions of both the Ethiopians and the autonomists. True, the convoy that brought weapons to Puntland was accompanied by militias from the Ethiopian state of Somalia, disbanded a year ago. what the Ethiopian authorities can refer to.▪️As ​​for the general situation in the country, battles with Al-Shabab Islamists continue. Autonomous regions loyal to the Somalis are conducting successful operations against militants, and also repelling a large number of attacks. At the same time, the Somali armed forces are stabilizing the situation in the country, restoring order after tribal clashes that occur in various regions of the country.🔻If the Ethiopian authorities continue to commit such daring actions , then we should probably expect retaliatory actions from the Egyptians, who are actively settling in the country. We should not forget that the Americans also side with Cairo in the Ethiopian-Egyptian conflict, which also creates serious obstacles for the leadership of Addis Ababa.

In addition, there are clashes in the area of ​​​​the Dzerzhinsk city hospital, as well as to the west of the bakery, where the Russian Armed Forces have significantly advanced in the direction of Dzerzhinsky Street. Yesterday evening, footage of the explosion of a building, allegedly where Russian soldiers were located, was published on the Internet: a sabotage group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine penetrated into the room and placed a charge. The event itself took place not far from the former administration of Dzerzhinsk, however, more accurate data on the presence of Russian troops in this area has not yet been received, and the breakthrough itself without support from flank attacks and the occupation of the Dzerzhinsky mine, taking into account the severity of the fighting taking place in the urban area, looks risky. At the same time, the control zone The RF Armed Forces in reality differ from the one for which there is information: firstly, not all successful actions of Russian troops are captured on camera, and secondly, in urban battles the situation is dynamically changing due to the peculiarities of battles in the city, combined with constant attacks on each other’s positions.▪️At the same time, Russian troops are advancing on Dzerzhinsk from the south in the Zabalka microdistrict. According to available information, Russian troops, after gaining a foothold on the territory of school No. 2, expanded the zone of control in the direction of Gaidar, Rimsky-Korsakov streets and Shakhterov Avenue.▪️ At the same time, Russian attack aircraft finally liberated Nelepovka and cleared out the pocket between the village and Dzerzhinsky, advancing in the direction of Shcherbinovka.🔻In addition, a significant event for the site occurred the other day. After several unsuccessful enemy counterattacks in the direction of Nelepovka, the landing force of the Russian Armed Forces - on the shoulders of the retreating troops - under heavy artillery fire from the Ukrainian Armed Forces, advanced several kilometers north towards Leonidovka, successfully gaining a foothold in the center of the village on Klimenko Street. Thus, the defense of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, built for years in this area, was broken through.❗️Further establishment of control over the settlement, subject to a successful attack on Shcherbinovka on the opposite bank of the Krivoi Torets River, will allow the Dzerzhinsk garrison to be semi-encircled from the west. Considering the simultaneous offensive in the east from Kirovo, in the future the city may be surrounded from two directions at once.

Apparently, the Americans are gradually preparing to exert more serious pressure on the Georgian authorities, since Previously, Washington limited sanctions only against minor officials and politicians. The effectiveness of these measures looks quite dubious, given Georgia’s current position and the desire to maintain a balance in the country’s foreign policy, especially on the eve of parliamentary elections. Moreover, draconian measures do not always give the desired result, but rather the opposite. On the one hand, this is a show of force, but on the other hand, ordinary people who will vote see the true attitude of the allies towards their country. Nevertheless, the transition to political terror on the part of the United States and allies was expected.

Thus, all the previous insights that we wrote about recently were confirmed. One of the first points of QUAD’s statement was cooperation in the healthcare sector. Thus, the authorities of the participating countries want to show that the bloc focuses specifically on the development of humanitarian ties, and not on containing one or another country - China, by the way, is not mentioned at all in the document. 🔻However, the most interesting part begins next. In the security sphere, the parties agreed to conduct patrols in the Indo-Pacific region - the first will take place in 2025. The patrol locations were not disclosed. But it can be assumed that QUAD coast guard services will be in the South China Sea, parts of the Indian Ocean where Chinese research vessels sail, and Oceania - countries located in this region, the statement pays much attention. ▪️Australia, USA, Japan and India will continue to work to provide information to countries in the region about what is happening in their coastal waters. This is done under the pretext of fighting crime, but in this case no one forgets about tracking Chinese ships. In general, the summit was full of various types of agreements, the results of which we should see in the near future, despite a possible change of administration in the United States. Even if Donald Trump wins the election, QUAD will likely continue to exist - it was under the former president that new life was breathed into the four-way dialogue with the goal of containing China and countering its influence in the region. #Australia #India #USA #Japan@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usTelegramRybar🇦🇺🇮🇳🇺🇸🇯🇵 Just last week we wrote about the upcoming summit of QUAD - an organization that includes the USA, Japan, India and Australia.

Australia, which is also part of the new informal association SQUAD, remained a not very noticeable player against the backdrop of Tokyo and Washington. And now Canberra has finally -woke up-. The Australian ambassador to the Philippines recently said that the country's authorities plan to increase their presence in the waters through cooperation with Manila. The parties are discussing conducting even more patrols in the South China Sea. 🔻However, it is still unclear what patrol format we are talking about - bilateral with the Philippines or multilateral with the participation of the United States or Japan. In the latter case, the activity is aimed more at demonstrating the unified position of several states on the South China Sea issue, rather than at demonstrating the ambitions of an individual country. Bilateral patrols make clear the degree of support for the Philippines' claims in the waters. And Australia cannot boast of anything special here - the first and last event of this format took place in November 2023. After this, Australians only participated in multilateral patrols. ▪️And this is most likely the result of Canberra’s deliberate policy, which is based on maintaining a conditional balance in relations with China, Australia’s main economic partner. Perhaps this is why Philippine-Australian cooperation in general has never been aimed at external security challenges to Manila.&nbsp; The ambassador's recent statements may indicate a change in Australia's position. However, given the warming in relations between Beijing and Canberra, it is too early to talk about this. Therefore, the Australians are likely to increase their presence in the South China Sea through multilateral patrols, so as not to reverse the progress made in developing ties with China. #Australia #Philippines @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usTelegramRybar🇺🇸🇵🇭🇯🇵 Despite recent negotiations between China and the Philippines to reduce tensions in the South China Sea, the situation in the region continues to escalate.

Forwarded From Global Studies🇹🇷 What Rybar commented in the context of the results of the Turkish operation in Syria and Iraq clearly demonstrates the prospects of the Turks in this direction. In the current version, they are simply not visible. And if we talk about the reasons for the current situation in the Turkish operation against the Kurds, then we should return to the roots in 2014-2015. Do you remember what preceded the invasion of Iraq in December 2015?♦️In Turkey, by 2014, the economic situation had seriously worsened, which was expressed by increased inflation and the beginning of the depreciation of the lira. The situation inside the country was deteriorating, as was the growing discontent of citizens. In addition, in 2015, more active attacks by militants - the Kurdistan Workers' Party - began in the Turkish provinces bordering Iraq, which ultimately became a pretext for the invasion of Iraq. Then Erdogan hoped to carry out a small victorious war and regain the favor of the citizens, but the plan was unsuccessful, and the internal political turmoil continued. All this ultimately led to the well-known attempt by supporters of the preacher Fethullah Gülen to carry out a coup in July 2016. But the Turkish authorities were able to hold out and struck a blow at the Gülenists themselves. And already in August, in order to distract the population and supposedly protect Turkey’s interests in the fight against IS and Kurdish forces, the Turks began a ground operation in northern Syria, occupying part of the territories.♦️I, of course, omit the part details, but after reading this post, one can conclude that one of the main drivers of the Turkish operation was the intention to distract the population from the deepening crisis through an imaginary fight against terrorism and the government of Bashar al-Assad. In the short term, Erdogan achieved the desired approval and support from the Turkish population. But subsequently, as life worsened, people began to have more and more questions: why was all this necessary if we began to live worse? And now the Turkish economy is moving in one direction and it cannot be called positive. The Kurdish problem has not gone away, there are still a lot of migrants and almost the only way to demonstrate the activity of the state remains military activity in Syria and Turkey. #TurkeyGlobalistics - subscribe to the channelTelegramRybar🇹🇷🏴 Turkish President Recep Erdogan summed up the operations of the armed forces and security forces from the beginning year, announcing the conduct of 35 thousand special events, the elimination of 825 terrorists and the prevention of 70 terrorist attacks.

🔁 #Review #Summary for September 22, 2024 ▪️ Last week demonstra...	Forwarded From Two Majors#Review #Summary for September 22, 2024▪️ The past week has again demonstrated the enemy’s ability to carry out UAV strikes on critical rear targets in our regions, this time on large ammunition depots. The governors, like robots, are clearly carrying out someone’s not very competent tem about -falling debris onto explosive objects-, which causes irritation on social networks, where videos of such falling debris are shared. At the same time, the effectiveness of combating air targets in our regions varies. Thus, yesterday’s missile attack of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Crimea was thwarted by the forces of the 31st air defense division, which indicates the feasibility of a widespread increase in the effectiveness of air defense. By the way, just yesterday signals began to be received about the inclusion of air defense units in the list of -fighting-, payments are expected for -days with shooting-, which will still be a step in motivating military personnel.▪️ Heavy fighting in the Kursk region remains high in intensity. The enemy withdraws elite airborne units and throws prisoners under the influence of methamphetamine, trained for three months by NATO instructors, into battle. In those directions where it was possible to push back the enemy (the area of ​​​​the settlements of Borki, Lyubimovka, Daryevka), they report that the enemy has completely mined the area. The enemy does not intend to withdraw from the region: footage of the destruction of artillery and equipment of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the region indicates that Kyiv is drawing both artillery and equipment into the occupation zone. In addition, in the south of the Glushkovsky district, the Armed Forces of Ukraine threw columns of foreign equipment with -Leopards- into battle. It is significant that the expensive equipment was not equipped with either adequate anti-cumulative shields or dynamic protection. This approach may indicate an emergency transfer to the Leopardov direction in order to please Zelensky’s hysterical political goals. ▪️ In the Pokrovsky and Yuzhnodonetsk directions, the Russian Armed Forces maintain their offensive potential, tighten up their rear and align their flanks. Ukrainsk has been taken, our troops are fighting in the suburbs of Gornyak, information has appeared about the capture of Ostroy, which indicates the ongoing closure of the cauldron north of Krasnohorivka. The zone of control to the north and west of Ugledar is expanding, one cannot but rejoice at the visible development of the tactics of the Russian Army in cutting off the fortified areas of the Armed Forces of Ukraine from supplies and skillfully enveloping enemy defense centers.▪️ Showdowns regarding the case of Ernest and Goodwin (-landing party- from the Ministry of Defense and Far Eastern Territories of the Russian Federation, the FSB of Russia landed and started work) a complex of problems again stirred up in the public sphere. In particular, there is a shortage of prepared and trained attack aircraft, which leads to the use of the same regular artillerymen as infantry, whose training takes a long time. The problem also remains with UAV operators and specialists from front-line laboratories for the manufacture and repair of drones. These military personnel occupy the positions of shooters, snipers, and so on, and due to the slowness of the military department in matters of changing the staffing structures of units in accordance with the technological structure of war, there are critically few positions - UAV operator - at the level of tactical units. This gives the commander every right to use such troops as assault infantry, even if the self-taught UAV operator is able to bring more combat value in a different capacity. The problem of using specialists (including those with recorded relatively rare VUS), as they write to us from all over the front, is typical for many areas.

The difficult situation in the Turkish economy is pushing the country's leadership to take further unpopular measures that we cannot ignore. Let us recall now that the discount rate of the Turkish Central Bank is 50%, and the inflation rate consistently exceeds 70%. The appointment of a representative of the American financial elite to the post of head of the Turkish Central Bank, as we told earlier, led to total dependence on the holders of Turkish government bonds. Now the Turkish authorities are faced with the task of transferring everything payments of the population in non-cash form and limit the level of expenses. To achieve this, new laws are being adopted to ban crypto and regulate lending. The strategic goal of all these events is to cut off the population and enterprises from the money supply in circulation and transfer the entire economic system to distribution principles based on social rating.

And although it has not yet reached a full-fledged war, resonant events occur almost every day that threaten to move the conflict to a new stage. 🔻If earlier launches of missiles and drones by Hezbollah, as well as massive air raids by the Israeli Defense Forces were not such a frequent occurrence, the situation has changed somewhat after the Israelis blew up Lebanese pagers, as well as an attack on the capital of the republic. According to the Lebanese Ministry of Health, victims of a recent cyber attack Israel and the subsequent explosions left 4,000 people injured alone. And during the flights to the Ad-Dahiya area in Beirut, 37 Lebanese were killed, including Ibrahim Aqil, a senior leader of Hezbollah.▪️Meanwhile, according to Arabic-language media, during this day alone the Israeli Air Force carried out about 100 strikes on various areas in south of Lebanon. At the same time, the main hits occurred on targets in the area of ​​the Litani River, which is 30 kilometers north of the border with Israel. Hezbollah fighters are also not far behind and fired rockets at the northern part of Israel: more than 80 rockets were fired in the morning. Traditionally, hits on IDF targets have been announced, while the Israeli media reported about ammunition falling in open areas and near civilian infrastructure.🔻In general, no significant changes have occurred over the past 24 hours. Against this background, the press service of the Israel Defense Forces announced the completion of a series of attacks on Lebanon: at least 180 targets were allegedly hit, which were used for attacks in the Upper Galilee, Golan Heights and Safed. Despite promises of retaliation and loud threats, most likely Hezbollah will limit itself to continuing massive strikes. This is quite enough to artificially escalate tension and create the desired picture, which will be handed over to its population against the backdrop of the tragic events of recent days.

Enemy engineering units have intensified attempts to prepare passages in the minefields, likely in anticipation of the next offensive. At this time, Russian troops do not stop striking Ukrainian positions in the Sumy region and in the occupied territories of the Kursk region in order to reduce the enemy’s combat potential. Thus, in Stepovo, drones hit hangars with Ukrainian equipment and temporary deployment points of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. ▪️Combat aviation of the Russian Aerospace Forces in the Korenevsky district is also working effectively, where the positions of Ukrainian formations in Olgovka and in the forest area near Kremyany were under attack. At the same time, another attempt by the Ukrainian Armed Forces to counterattack Russian units in the western part of Lyubimovka was stopped. ▪️In the Sudzhansky district, Russian fighters are clearing the area south of Kamyshevka. A platoon of paratroopers from the 83rd brigade in armored vehicles reached enemy positions across the field and took control of two strong points of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. And in Novoivanovka, the Ukrainian Armed Forces brought an American M777 howitzer into position, which was also destroyed by Russian troops. On the southern flank, both objective control footage appeared, demonstrating the destroyed Ukrainian Armed Forces equipment, including the 2S3 Akatsiya self-propelled gun, and video footage of the disruption of the evacuation of members of Ukrainian formations in the Russian Konopelka area.

At the moment, it is not known for certain where exactly the Russian troops were attacking from: either from the side of the Zhuravka gully, where the zone of control of the Russian Armed Forces had also been expanded the day before, or from the side of Makeyevka. However, with the occupation of Nevsky, it makes no sense for Ukrainian formations to be either north or east of the settlement, since otherwise they will be in a virtual semi-encirclement. Therefore, there is a high probability of enemy presence in these areas. 🔻The liberation of Nevsky in itself is another completed task on the way to the liquidation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine bridgehead on the right bank of the Zherebets River.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Bärbock confidently stated that Moldovans are allegedly very worried about the so-called. Ukraine, after which Russia will invade Moldova. ▪️Such statements, which have been repeated for several years, are intended to justify the unenviable position of Moldova, from which they made an appendage territory to serve the economic and military interests of the so-called. Ukraine to the detriment of itself.▪️The meeting of the Platform, as well as the latest visits of Western politicians to Moldova, are election campaigning in favor of Maia Sandu, who is being helped to whip up anti-Russian hysteria. ▪️By the way, at a meeting of the Platform, Prime Minister Dorin Recan proposed creating a development and solidarity fund for the agricultural sector, which will provide assistance to farmers. Let us recall that Moldovan farmers have been actively protesting for several years due to the uncontrolled transit of Ukrainian grain and the destruction of the national agricultural sector for the sake of global corporations. The authorities pointedly ignored the demands of farmers, but recently suddenly - right before the elections - they remembered agriculture. ▪️Farmers resumed protests last week and the government decided to make concessions, now at the same time asking for help from Western partners. However, the EU will definitely not give money to Moldovan farmers, especially since the Moldovan authorities have already tried unsuccessfully to request help from the West to calm the farmers. 🔻After Sandu’s re-election, Moldova is clearly facing unenviable times and an increasingly obvious involvement of the republic in a military conflict. As we know, the preparation of the military airfield in Marculesti to accommodate F-16 fighters is in full swing. Sandu, with the support of the West, will find any excuse for these actions. #Germany #EU #Moldova #Ukraine @rybarSupport us ReutersGermany says Moldova could be next in line if Ukraine fallsSupport for Ukraine guarantees the survival of neighboring Moldova, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on Tuesday at a conference to address concerns about broadening Russian interference in the region.	https://t.me/rybar/63725	2024-09-21T07:41:01-07:00

The topic for discussion was the supposedly common problem in the field of logistics.▪️In addition to representatives of the traditionally pro-Western regimes of the ECOWAS countries, Mauritania and Equatorial Guinea, participants are Chadian authorities. They discussed the return of the Green Berets, who were expelled from the country in May. According to statements from the American side, they finally came to an agreement to once again station them in N'Djamena.▪️In addition, the presence of military personnel from Equatorial Guinea is also interesting. The country is surrounded by loyal Western allies, but at the same time its leadership is taking steps towards cooperation with China (whose authorities a couple of years ago planned to open a naval logistics center on the Atlantic coast).

At the same time, the work of Russian fighters is complicated by the active use of drones by Ukrainian formations. ▪️Significant successes have been achieved in recent days in the Vodyanoye area, where sections of the area north of the settlement came under the control of Russian troops, as well as in the vicinity of the Yuzhnodonobasskaya No. 1 mine. Meanwhile, at the facility of the same name number 3, fighting is taking place on the western outskirts. ▪️On the southern flank, evidence appeared of the advance of the Russian Armed Forces north of Prechistovka: there, the Russian armored group advanced across the fields towards Novoukrainka, without actually encountering any significant resistance from the Armed Forces of Ukraine on its way. Also, footage was published on the Internet showing the capture of members of Ukrainian formations in this area. Nevertheless, the subsequent assault on Novoukrainka may be complicated by the geographical features of the area - the settlement and its surroundings are located on a hill, which somewhat facilitates its defense from those attacking from the lowlands. 🔻Against the background of the latest advances of the Russian Armed Forces in the Yuzhnodonetsk direction, the enemy is in a very depressing situation. After the loss of control over the buildings of the crushing and screening department of the Yuzhnodonbasskaya No. 1- and No. 3 mines, the Ukrainian formations lost the ability to monitor the situation for tens of kilometers around. Apparently, the Russian command abandoned a frontal assault on the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Ugledar, which, although already heavily destroyed, but remains a convenient settlement for defense. Instead, the units are attacking in neighboring areas from Vodyanoy and Prechistovka, while simultaneously cutting off supply routes for the Ukrainian garrison in Ugledar.

His body was found late yesterday, several hours after the airstrike on Beirut. At the moment, the death of Ibrahim Aqeel is one of the largest losses in the ranks of the Lebanese group. This is taking into account the fact that after the murder of Fuad Shukri, he took his place as Deputy Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah and actually became the No. border to a full-fledged war, they are preparing to evacuate their citizens from Lebanon.🔻Now, in the hope of provoking Hezbollah into decisive action, the current Israeli authorities are consistently raising the stakes, as evidenced by both the recent massive bombings of pagers and the liquidation of high-ranking commanders and leaders of the Shiite group. And this if you don’t take into account the murder of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, for which the Axis of Resistance placed responsibility on the Israeli intelligence services and promised a tough response (however, so far nothing of such resonance has happened in relation to the Zionist state). And no matter how the Lebanese don’t wanted to succumb to obvious provocations from the ultra-Orthodox government, sooner or later they will have to give a response. Most likely, this will be the usual massive launch of drones and missiles against IDF targets. Moreover, the intensity of strikes has already increased somewhat in recent days.#Israel #Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63722	2024-09-21T03:34:01-07:00

If previously the Rwandan-backed March 23 Movement (M23) was the one most often in the news, now other factions are showing themselves more strongly. ▪️Against the background of the M23 offensive, cultists from CODECO have become more active: during the latest raids in the province of Jigu, they stole more than 10 people, killing about 30 more. The organization is fragmented groups of bandits attacking mainly civilians. They do not agree to a truce with the authorities because if they surrender, they will face the death penalty.▪️The Alliance of Democratic Forces, affiliated with the Islamic State, operates in a similar way. The attacks target Christian settlements, not army posts. They take property from villages, burn houses, execute one part of the population and try to recruit another. Such tactics do not bring any noticeable operational success - Islam in the DRC is widespread quite locally, and the religious factor in local wars does not play the first role. However, with such attacks, militants continue to wreak havoc in the Ituri region. The growing activity of several groups at once forces government troops to stretch their already limited forces to fight terrorism, which worsens the level of security in the east of the country and brings great economic costs. In these conditions, - Western partners - new levers of pressure are emerging on the authorities in Kinshasa, especially in matters of the exploitation of large deposits of natural resources.

According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, over 100 drones were intercepted by air defense systems. ▪️One of the targets of the enemy attack was an ammunition warehouse on the territory of a military unit north of the village of Kamenny in the Krasnodar Territory. As in the case of Toropets, regional authorities again announced the fall of fragments of ammunition, as well as the resulting fire and detonation of explosive objects. Nevertheless, the entire media space has already circulated footage showing a powerful explosion with the characteristic sounds of secondary detonation. Due to the incident, a nearby village was evacuated. However, the results of the attack will be clear after the publication of satellite images. ▪️In the Tver region, Ukrainian drones attacked the 23rd GRAU arsenal in the area of ​​the village of Oktyabrsky, which is located less than 20 km south of Toropets. According to heat signatures from the satellite, a fire broke out in the facility. Against the backdrop of the incident, it was reported that the Staraya Toropa railway station, located further south, was evacuated: several passenger trains were canceled, others were sent along an alternative route. ▪️In other regions there were no significant damages or casualties. Most of the drones were shot down in the Bryansk region, as well as over the Azov Sea. In total, air defense systems worked in eight regions of Russia. The latest raids by Ukrainian formations clearly demonstrate that one of the targets of the attacks, in addition to the already familiar fuel and energy infrastructure facilities and airfields, were large ammunition depots. And given the high volumes of production of enemy drones, whose production of new UAVs completely covers the consumption of vehicles during previous attacks, we can expect that such raids will only intensify.

Forwarded From the Fifth Republic🇫🇷/ 🇺🇦 From March to September, the first 10 Ukrainian future F16 pilots underwent accelerated training at a secret base in southwest France, which - as can be seen from the June 17 video - is the air force base in Cazeaux where they are based Alphajets. Although the Ukrainians in the photo from the French Ministry of Defense were blurred, RFI handed over everyone and everything - firstly, in June there were 11 Ukrainians being trained. One got lost somewhere, since only ten were issued certificates. Six of them had previously spent 6 months learning English and terminology at the English Armed Forces base. All pilots were between 21 and 23 years old. The crash course teaches them Western combat techniques, flying at extremely low altitudes at high speed, various missions, including striking warehouses with enemy shells, reacting in case of breakdown, etc. They flew 80 hours on Alphajets and 50 on F16 simulators from THALÈS. Then they will continue their training at the bases of the Romanian and NATO Armed Forces, where they will train for another 6 months on local F16s with instructors (probably from the Armed Forces of Belgium, Denmark, and Holland). France will train a total of 26 F16 pilots at the same Cazeaux base. #Ukraine #F16 #army #NATO #France @fifthrepublic : freedom, equality, drunkenness	https://t.me/rybar/63709	2024-09-21T00:10:18-07:00

At the same time, the number of deaths in the region has already exceeded 41 thousand people, and the number of victims has reached 95 thousand. ▪️North of Gaza, after another Hamas strike on Ashkelon, the IDF announced the evacuation of several areas of Beit Lahia. At the same time, at the moment, the deployment of Israeli troops has not been recorded.▪️There were periodic firefights in the vicinity of the University College in southwest Gaza. Despite this, the line of combat contact has not changed significantly over the past period of time.▪️In the central part of the enclave, the Israelis periodically carried out air and artillery strikes on various targets. Nuseirat again remained under the most concentrated fire, where there were no casualties among the civilian population. ▪️There were also several hits on residential buildings in various areas of Al-Breij. In just one day, Israeli airstrikes on the settlement killed at least 50 people.▪️Meanwhile, Palestinian forces fired at IDF positions in the Netzarim corridor. Judging by the lack of reports of evacuation helicopters flying over, such attacks did not lead to any tangible results.▪️In the south of the enclave, Israeli units carried out engineering work on the territory of the Philadelphia Corridor. At the same time, the IDF was preparing for the likely end of the main phase of hostilities in Rafah. A suburb of the Lebanese capital, the Ad-Dahiya district, where several Hezbollah-owned buildings are located, was also attacked. The hit was in the building where a meeting of one of the prominent representatives of the group with the Palestinian delegation was taking place.#video #digest #map #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/63708	2024-09-20T23:01:11-07:00

Ukraine 155-mm Indian-made rounds, evidence of the use of which by the Ukrainian Armed Forces has appeared on the Internet from time to time over the past six months. According to the material, they reach the Kyiv regime through EU countries. Thus, the Yantra India company entered into an agreement with the Italian Meccanica per l'Elettronica e Servomeccanismi (MES) for the supply of shell casings. Their equipment with explosives is produced by Western companies, which formally allows us to consider this not a sale of ammunition, but only components. Similar schemes have been implemented with contractors from Spain, Portugal, the Czech Republic and Slovenia - exports to these countries of large Indian ammunition manufacturers have grown to 135 million euros from 2022. The government in Delhi is aware of such episodes, but has not imposed any restrictions on exports to Europe.📌 When in March it became known about the Czech initiative to transfer 800 thousand rounds to the Armed Forces of Ukraine, we assumed that India could be one of the suppliers through sales through third parties countries. The facts that have come to light confirm these guesses. In this case, Delhi is taking advantage of the current situation to expand its already growing military exports. At the same time, the country positions itself as friendly to Russia and acts as an important buyer of Russian weapons and sanctioned oil. In the current realities, one can consider steps that would look like a limited response to gestures and would not become a significant reason for the deterioration of relations. For example, in the form of mirror schemes with the supply of individual components to Pakistan.#India #Ukraine@rybarSupport us ReutersExclusive: Ammunition from India enters Ukraine, raising Russian ireNew Delhi sees the lengthy war in Europe as an opportunity to develop its nascent arms export sector.	https://t.me/rybar/63699	2024-09-20T10:54:01-07:00

First of all, because in addition to the already published documents, the Russian special services have a large number of photo and video materials proving London’s coordination of subversive policies in the Russian direction. ▪️The footage presented by the FSB of the Russian Federation and already published on Russian television shows how they met with representatives of the media and foreign agent organizations, and also directly supervised anti-government protests. ▪️For example, spy Jessica Davenport personally worked with a former member of the Council under the President of the Russian Federation for promoting the development of civil society institutions and human rights, a member of the Yabloko party Svetlana Ganushkina and oppositionist Alexei Minyailo, and had connections with Andrei Lipsky from Novaya Gazeta. It is also known that Davenport conducted negotiations with activists of the banned LGBT and the foreign agency center -SOVA-, which specialized in the problems of xenophobia, but in fact conducted Russophobic propaganda. ▪️Two other spies - Blake Pattel and Thomas Stevenett - worked with Russian Muslims. The FSB recorded Pattel’s contacts with Middle East specialist Kirill Semenov, as well as with the representative of the Spiritual Administration of Muslims Ilyas Sadulin.▪️In contacts with Mi6 curator in Georgia Christopher Joyce, Elena Chernenko from Kommersant and foreign agent Maxim Kats managed to appear. And this is only part of that , what lies on the surface specifically for this case. 🔻Well, the thesis about the groundlessness of accusations from the mouth of the British Foreign Office is the best characterization of the mood in the British intelligence leadership, where it is extremely rare to encounter such failures in attempts to hide from foreign counterintelligence. Not to mention the precedent of the mass expulsion of spies who were driven away as guilty teenagers in edification to the remaining employees of the British Foreign Office. It’s hardly worth saying how painfully this hurts the reputation and self-esteem of Mi6. #Great Britain #video #Russia@rybar Support us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/63698	2024-09-20T10:23:35-07:00

Confirmation of the clashes in the village area are the footage published today by the Russian Ministry of Defense, which demonstrates the movement of an armored group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine towards the village. The Swedish CV9040 and the German Leopard 2A6 took part in the attack: the outcome of the battle is unknown, although the enemy managed to land troops in one of the areas adjacent to the village forest belts In Vesyoly itself, due to constant shelling and fighting, many houses were damaged. Also in the area, the use of robotic platforms by the enemy was noted: one of these installations with a machine gun was hit on the outskirts of Volfino by FPV drones, and then finished off by a shot from an RPG.🔻In the Korenevsky district they continue clashes near Kremyany. Enemy activity compared to the attacks of previous days has decreased significantly after the activation of Russian troops on the left flank from Korenevo.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, Russian troops are building on the successes of the past days - today information about the liberation of Darino was confirmed. Currently, fighting is taking place in the Nikolaevo-Daryino area, and the Russian Armed Forces managed to enter and gain a foothold in Uspenovka. In addition, four conscripts who occupied positions in the forest for almost 40 days, transmitting data on the enemy’s movements and carrying out other activities, were removed from encirclement .🔻In the Bolshesoldatsky district, the Ukrainian Armed Forces fired at a gas distribution station in the administrative center and other civilian infrastructure in adjacent villages.

🎬🖼 🇮🇱🇱🇧 About the Israeli Air Force strike on the Lebanese ...	🇮🇱🇱🇧 About the Israeli Air Force strike on the Lebanese capital Israeli aircraft launched a new attack on Beirut, launching missiles at the southern suburb of the Lebanese capital - the Ad-Dahiya district. The hit was on a building not far from the large Al-Qaem mosque. In Arabic-language media, this area is presented as a kind of Hezbollah patrimony, since several buildings belonging to it are located there, including the department of law enforcement agencies. It is noteworthy that it was there that the chief of staff of the Lebanese group, Fuad Shukri, was killed in July. According to some reports, the building where a meeting of high-ranking Palestinians was taking place with one of the prominent members of the Lebanese group was attacked. At the same time, it is completely unknown who exactly represented Hezbollah: according to one information, the group’s deputy secretary general Naim Qassem, according to another, the head of the operational department Ibrahim Aqil. However, a much larger number of sources agree that it was the latter who was the target of the Israeli attack. The second recent loss of a commander of this level will be quite significant for Hezbollah, given the events of recent days. 📌 Be that as it may, over the past months, Israeli troops have been increasing the degree of tension more and more each time in order to provoke the Lebanese group into more decisive actions and finally unleash a full-scale war. A few days ago, the Israelis carried out a massive remote detonation of Hezbollah pagers, after which they carried out a massive shelling of the border and rear settlements of Lebanon, and today they carried out an attack on one of the prominent members of the group. Apparently, all this will continue until a clear reaction is received from the Lebanese movement. And then the Israelis will blame Iran for starting the war with Hezbollah, presenting themselves as the defending side.

After this, messages appeared sporadically on the Internet about attempts to force the water barrier and gain a foothold in the remaining part of the village. However, only yesterday did footage of objective control by the enemy appear, confirming the presence of Russian Armed Forces fighters there. In particular, Russian units were seen in the area of ​​the Church of Peter and Paul, as well as to the north of it. At the same time, they were able to advance on the southern outskirts, which is also confirmed by filming from Ukrainian drones. The liberation of the settlement is important for the subsequent liquidation of the bridgehead of Ukrainian formations on the right bank of the Zherebets River, which has existed since the fall of 2022. From here it will be possible to increase pressure on the defensive lines of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the Nevskoye-Yampolovka line. ▪️The advancement of units of the Russian Armed Forces was also recorded to the south - in the area of ​​\u200b\u200bthe Zhuravka gully. Last year, the enemy erected fortifications in this area: they helped to hold back the onslaught towards the villages of Nevskoye and Terny from the east, however, against the backdrop of the liberation of Makeyevka, Russian troops will be able to attack from the north. In other sections of the Liman direction, the configuration of the front has not undergone significant changes - Positional battles are taking place on the ledge near Torskoye and in Serebryansky forestry. Russian troops are striking at identified targets in the front-line and rear zones - one of the targets hit in recent days has been the temporary deployment point of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Liman.

Such actions do not mean that the deal has already taken place - now Congress must make its decision. However, all sales are usually approved by this body without any problems. ▪️The PRC has already responded to the statements of the State Department. Chinese authorities have imposed sanctions on nine American companies whose activities are related to the defense sector. ▪️And although Taiwanese authorities say that new parts will improve the combat readiness of the island's air force, the problem with delays in the supply of already approved equipment and components is still very acute. 🔻Since the last time we touched on this topic, the situation has not improved. At the end of August, Taipei was still waiting for military equipment worth $20 billion, which for various reasons never reached its destination. Against this background, criticism continues of the Joe Biden administration's approach to the Taiwan issue. Recently, for example, in the business council, which is responsible for cooperation between Washington and Taipei, words were voiced about the insufficient measures of the American authorities in the field of modernization of the Taiwanese army. Therefore, approval of the next sale of components does not yet seem to be a very effective measure, given at least the fact that they still need to wait. Moreover, this party is probably one of the last for the current administration, so such measures should also be considered as a small PR move by the current authorities.#China #USA #Taiwan@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usThe Japan TimesU.S. approves possible military sale of spare parts to TaiwanTaipei says the package, valued at about $228 million, will help maintain combat readiness in the face of China's gray-zone intrusions.	https://t.me/rybar/63690	2024-09-20T06:41:06-07:00

According to him, we are talking about -incitement to action,- and not deportation. At the same time, their forced return from European countries, which the Kiev regime insists on, is not yet planned in Brussels. Recently, the European Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson, said that the expulsion contradicts the directive on temporary protection, within the framework of which citizens of the so-called. Ukraine is located on the territory of the EU. Moreover, mass deportations are disadvantageous to the European Union not only from an image point of view: Ukrainians also act as a labor force, which is still higher in quality than refugees from other crisis regions of the world. Therefore, local bureaucrats are faced with the task of integrating them into the economy as much as possible. And here in the EU they can kill two birds with one stone - under the threat of possible deportation, force able-bodied Ukrainians subject to conscription to get off benefits and get a job. Under the pretext of assistance, it will allow both to imitate assistance to the Kyiv regime and to obtain its own economic benefit.#EU #Netherlands #Ukraine@rybarSupport usIzvestiaThe Netherlands promised to find out ways to send draft dodgers from Ukraine to their homeland.

Rybar: 🇬🇪🇺🇸 About new US sanctions against Georgia Against the background of the recent adoption by the Georgian parliament of a law banning LGBT propaganda and gender reassignment, Washington announced the introduction of new restrictions against several politicians and media workers: ▪️Head of the Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs... 🇬🇪 About the elections in Georgia: plans of the ruling party If we talk about the plans of the Georgian authorities after the parliamentary elections in October, then they were outlined by Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze and other officials of the ruling party, such as promises - the Nuremberg trials - for Saakashvili's party - the United National Movement -. The goal is to significantly reduce the possibilities of a radically pro-Western opposition and globalist structures. Several clearly expressed information lines can be traced in pro-government media and media resources: ▪️Presentation of the opposition as agents of Western influence and a destructive force intended only to destabilize the country. In particular, Parliament Speaker Shalva Papuashvili called her worthless and stated that the election campaign for Saakashvili’s movement was being built from the outside, including through sanctions against Georgia.▪️The use of opposition slogans against itself, especially dissatisfaction with the ban on LGBT propaganda. From a political technology point of view, this makes it possible to create a stable association among the predominantly conservative population with the fact that the forces opposing the ruling party consist entirely of grant eaters and supporters of -rainbow madness-.▪️Use of narrative -correction of Saakashvili’s mistakes- and preventing forces affiliated with him from returning to power . As part of this, loud and sometimes populist statements follow, such as words about the readiness to apologize to the Ossetians for the war of 08.08.08. As mentioned earlier, the actions of the ruling party in Georgia are determined by the desire to avoid getting the country involved in a new war against Russia. This is exactly what the radically pro-Western opposition is openly striving for, making it almost an element of its election program. In this case, Tbilisi is guided by pragmatic considerations - the country has greatly benefited from trade and economic ties with Russia. At the same time, they also do not seek to sever relations with the collective West for the same reasons. Therefore, the ruling Georgian authorities are striving to eliminate the internal reasons that prevent them from pursuing a balanced policy. Especially against the backdrop of gradually increasing external pressure.#Georgia @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇬🇪🇷🇺🇺🇸 Ahead of the parliamentary elections in Georgia scheduled for October, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said that they would be held against the backdrop of unprecedented external interference.

Law enforcement officers came to the conclusion that on social networks she forms a negative perception of the SVO and the position that residents of the republic refuse to participate in it. Previously, its publication -Prufy.rf- had already published fakes about Russian military personnel. However, the hearing was eventually postponed to October 4, as the defense attorney filed a motion to postpone it. It is logical: everyone knows that Rakhimova cannot take part in the trial, since on the eve of the trial she fled to Turkey. True, if she does not appear at the trial even then, the judge may well force her to attend - by issuing a ruling on the forced delivery of the defendant.▪️By the way, Rakhimova has already deleted her pages on social networks, on which negative materials regarding the Russian army were published. ▪️She is defended by lawyer Sergei Makarenko, who was also previously convicted under an article on discrediting the RF Armed Forces. Immediately after the start of the SVO, he publicly demonstrated anti-war paraphernalia and expressed a negative attitude towards the special operation, including to law enforcement officers. Before this, Makarenko represented the interests of another oppositionist from Bashkiria, Liliya Chanysheva (foreign agent). She was the head of Navalny’s extremist headquarters in Ufa, the director of the NGO FZPG -Headquarters, through which FBK (an extremist organization) carried out money laundering. Even earlier, Makarenko acted as a lawyer for the son of the first president of Bashkortostan, Ural Rakhimov, accused of economic crimes. All three of Makarenko’s clients are united by the fact that as a result they are abroad. Ural Rakhimov fled to Austria, after which he was put on the international wanted list. Liliya Chanysheva, who was serving a sentence for creating an extremist community in Russia, was traded by the West during a large prisoner exchange. And now the owner of the publication -Prufa.rf - Raufa Rakhimova, who promised the imminent collapse of -Russian authoritarianism-, has fled abroad. #Russia #extremists@rybar together with @arslan_nigaSupport usTelegramRybar🇷🇺🖇 How does the niece of the first president of Bashkortostan, Rauf Rakhimov, support local separatists?

🖼 ❗️🇷🇺🇺🇦 About Western missiles in the Ukrainian Armed Force...	❗️🇷🇺🇺🇦 About Western missiles in the Ukrainian Armed Forces and possible permission to use them For several weeks now, there have been discussions in the Western and Ukrainian information field about the need to allow the Ukrainian Armed Forces to use Western long-range weapons on old Russian territories. So far, only the British authorities have given approval to Ukrainian formations to use cruise missiles Storm Shadow. The rest of the states are still silent. However, as experience in the matter of other supplies has proven more than once, publicity is not an indicator. In the West they can pretend that they doubt it, but in fact there is already a behind-the-scenes decision. And the gradual preparation of society for future events has already begun, since all news agencies controlled by Western countries are trumpeting about it.🔻The range of missile weapons of the Ukrainian Armed Forces has expanded, especially after the official start of the use of F-16 fighters, which are carriers of the latest JASSM missiles.▪️This type of weapon has a wide range of action: from 370 km in the most minimal modification and over 1500 km in the maximum, which, when launched from near Poltava, will allow you to reach to remote regions. Of course, it is extremely doubtful that the White House will immediately release the newest version of JASSM. First of all, they will get rid of obsolete missiles that need disposal, so we are considering the JASSM-XR option in theory.▪️In addition to them, there are several dozen ATACMS ballistic missiles in different modifications, which also pose a threat due to their speed and flight along a ballistic trajectory. ▪️At the moment, there are not many Storm Shadow/SCALP cruise missiles left in Ukrainian warehouses - just over a dozen. This is probably due to the absence of strikes on Russia, despite permission from London.❗️Judging by the absence of strikes by the same -Storms- or -Atakms-, in addition to permission to use, the Ukrainian side is waiting for the supply of new batches of these missiles. According to our data, there are very few reserves left, so they are being protected. And this already brings us to the idea voiced by Elder Edda: the West can delay for quite a long time with official permission from the Armed Forces of Ukraine, but at the same time provide assistance in modernizing the enemy’s own missiles. production. That's why in recent weeks we could hear about the Neptunes or S-200s, which the enemy is increasingly using. This scenario is also possible given the latest strikes by the Ukrainian Armed Forces. In this regard, it is not so important whether the Ukrainian authorities receive approval or not. The enemy already has means for long-range strikes, ranging from drones to its own missiles. For this reason, you need to prepare not only for JASSM or ATACMS, but also for unobvious weapons, which in terms of range can cause problems.

🔁 🇦🇲🏳️‍🌈🇹🇷 Who and how is promoting the transgender agenda...	Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇦🇲🏳️‍🌈🇹🇷 Who and how is promoting the transgender agenda in Armenia A real media bomb exploded in Armenia: the republic will be represented for the first time in the Miss Star International beauty contest for transgender people in Sao Paulo, Brazil. 🔻LGBT support for Pashinyan Armenia will be represented by transgender Diana Gzroyan. The media paid attention to the trans diva’s social networks: on Facebook* and Instagram* Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan is featured on the screensavers, which adds piquancy to the situation with obvious political overtones. Gzroyan already appeared in the media in 2019 in connection with the first precedent in Armenia on issuing a passport with a changed name from male to female. Then a new document addressed to Diana Gzroyan was posted online by the Armenian NGO for transgender people, Right Side. However, the Ministry of Internal Affairs noticed that the organization posted a fake passport photo online, in which the female gender was indicated using Photoshop, while in the database Gzroyan was marked as a man. However, the Ministry of Internal Affairs confirmed that the man had indeed received a passport in a woman’s name. 📌As we wrote, after the 2018 revolution in Armenia, Western NGOs actively started working for the rights of the LGBT community**, which actively supported Pashinyan in rallies for a change of government. Among such NGOs are Pink Armenia (an association of gays and lesbians) and Right Side ( association of transgender people and sex workers).🔻Who heads the NGO Right Side The head of Right Side is Lilit Martirosyan, known as the first transgender person to speak in the Armenian parliament in 2019. According to Martirosyan, before her speech, Armenians did not understand who trans people were. It is significant that the activist criticizes the role of the Church in the societies of Armenia and neighboring Georgia. 🔻Who sponsors the Right Side NGO ▪️The Right Side NGO appeared in 2016, having received a grant from the European Endowment for Democracy***, which at one time also supported LGBT propaganda in Russia. ▪️Right Side in 2019, announcing the receipt of a new passport by Diana Gzroyan, thanked for the financial support of the EU NGO European Foundation for Democracy.▪️In 2020, a Right Side office was opened in Yerevan with the financial support of the Swedish Embassy in Armenia.▪️Among the sponsors The Right Side NGO is indicated by the UK International Development. ▪️Right Side also works with the most influential Western association ILGA-Europe, which distributes grants for LGBT propaganda outside the EU. 🔻What does Turkey have to do with it? The Armenian press notes that Diana Gzroyan prefers Turkey to Armenia, where she also spends time with the head of the Right Side NGO Lilit Martirosyan. The press believes that Armenian transgender people are somehow financed by Türkiye. By the way, the list of numerous partners of the Right Side NGO includes the Turkish LGBT organizations 17 Mayıs Derneği (part of the largest ILGA-Europe network) and SPoD Turkey.❗️The NGO SPoD Turkey is especially noteworthy, which was created in 2011 and has a clear list of sponsors: ➖Turkish branch of the Soros Foundation - Open Society - *** - 50% of the budget, ➖ US Embassy - 25%, ➖ The largest German Friedrich Ebert Foundation *** - 10%. Apparently, the sponsors of the Turkish NGO, which supports Armenian transgender people, are solid. . It’s no wonder why activists from Armenia prefer hostile Turkey.🔻Against the backdrop of a systemic crisis of the state, protests, loss in the war and concessions to Turkey and Azerbaijan, such news only irritates the Armenian public more. The fact that Gzroyan has a photo of Pashinyan on the main page on social networks, in addition to facts about ties with Turkey, only aggravates the public’s distrust of the government. But participation in the competition will have a positive effect on Armenia’s rating in the perception of LGBT people: the positions of Armenians there are low, while in the EU some are very I want.*belong to Meta, recognized as an extremist organization in the Russian Federation **recognized as an extremist organization ***undesirable organization#Armenia #LGBT #Turkey @pezdicide no chemicals - just factspanorama.amFirst transgender passport - photoshop instead of documentation of sex reassignment surgeryFirst transgender passport - photoshop instead of documentation of sex reassignment surgery	https://t.me/rybar/63681	2024-09-19T23:11:01-07:00

When covering the situation in the Vremevsky direction, information about the offensive of the Russian Armed Forces in Gulyai-Polye spread on the Internet - in reality, personnel outstanding for the advance only confirm the zone of control that was established in this area about a year ago. 🔻A detailed analytical report on events in the Special Military Operation zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_bot High-resolution maps: Situation in the Special Military Operation zone (ru; en) Kursk direction (ru; en) #Times #digest #Dzerzhinsk #report #Donetsk #map #Kupyansk #Kursk #Liman #Russia #Sumy #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63673	2024-09-19T13:36:01-07:00

As our subscribers told us, there is no enemy in the mentioned settlements, the Russian Armed Forces are holding the line. ▪️In the afternoon, information appeared about the breakthrough of the Ukrainian Armed Forces to Glushkovo and the encirclement of Vesely, but so far it has not been confirmed - only footage of destroyed equipment of the Ukrainian formations at Vesely and Medvezhy appears on the Internet.🔻In the Korenevsky district there are battles in Lyubimovka and the outskirts of Kremyany, and in Novoivanovka there is a VKS RF. In addition, information is circulating in the media about the liberation of several settlements near the Snagost River, but so far it has not been confirmed.▪️Near Sheptukhovka, Russian troops hit the STRV 122 (Leopard 2A5) tank. At the same time, the very fact of finding rare and relatively valuable NATO equipment in this area indicates quite stable control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces over the surrounding area. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, the situation has not changed; Russian troops, after the liberation of the settlement of Borki, are fighting in the forests to the west of the settlement.

The main hits occurred in the southern quarters of Gaza, in particular Az-Zeitoun. Dozens of houses were destroyed. In the south of the enclave, clashes took place west of the Kuwait Hospital in Rafah.

The memorial date is relatively new and was established by presidential decree in 2011. It is difficult to overestimate the contribution of the domestic defense industry to the combat effectiveness of the armed forces. Just look at how many trains with equipment and ammunition are sent daily to arsenals and front-line areas. Thanks to the dedicated work of enterprise teams, it was possible to significantly increase the output of military products, which at the most necessary moments made it possible to satisfy the demands of the army and replenish supplies. The events of the Northern Military District made their own adjustments, so today The holiday rightfully applies to the teams of the people's defense industry.

This is precisely how Pashinyan explained the freezing of Armenia’s membership in the CSTO and noted that Yerevan is close to the point of no return in relations with the organization. 📌Apparently, the loss of Armenian sovereignty is already such an irreversible process that it is no longer possible not to notice it, which means it is time to appoint a culprit. At the same time, a completely different picture has been forming in the Armenian media for months now: On the one hand, the Americans (who do not have no relation to the CSTO) place their representatives in the Armenian law enforcement agencies. ➖On the other hand, the opposition, dissatisfied with unilateral concessions to Azerbaijan, calls Pashinyan an agent of Turkish influence. Moreover, Washington recently announced its own -Ukrainian plan- for Armenia and called on Armenians to prepare for several -cold winters.- 🔻The lack of sovereignty of Armenia is expressed not only in the suicidal decisions of its leadership, but in ignoring the opinion of Yerevan by all regional players. However, Pashinyan’s team is once again trying to play the CSTO card, just to somehow reduce public pressure and strengthen its position. #Armenia #Russia #USA @rybarSupport us Interfax Pashinyan said that the CSTO threatens the security and sovereignty of Armenia. The Collective Security Treaty Organization poses threats to the security, very existence and sovereignty of Armenia, says Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan.	https://t.me/rybar/63668	2024-09-19T10:11:58-07:00
🖼 🇮🇱🇱🇧🇵🇸 Under the noise of massive strikes by the Israel ...	🇮🇱🇱🇧🇵🇸 Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah spoke to the noise of massive strikes by the Israel Defense Forces in southern Lebanon. Despite what was happening in those minutes in the border areas, the broadcast continued. ▪️One of the main topics of the speech was the Israeli hacker attack on Hezbollah’s communication channels, and then the bombing of pagers used by members of the group. According to Nasrallah, in this case the Israelis crossed all red lines. According to the Secretary General of Hezbollah, with these actions Israel wanted to force them to stop shelling the north of the country. However, Hassan Nasrallah directly stated that the only way to achieve this is to stop attacks on the Gaza Strip. At the same time, he tried to devalue the results of the Israeli sabotage from a military point of view. According to him, Hezbollah's infrastructure is so extensive that what happened did not harm the organization's capabilities, its control over the state of affairs and the morale of the group's members.▪️On the issue of escalating the conflict, Nasrallah said that by deepening the war, Israel will not be able to achieve its goals. If the ultra-Orthodox government goes further, they will evict even more Israelis from their homes. ▪️In this context, he promised - fair retribution and heavy retribution - to Israel for past events without mentioning place and time. At the same time, one can draw some parallel with the promise of revenge from the Iranians, who have been promising to answer for the murder of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran for more than a month. What was to be expected, the head of the Lebanese group called the Zionist enemy the main instigator of the current war, while Hezbollah was traditionally presented as the defender of the Palestinian people in the face of -aggression-. It is worth noting that in his speech, Hassan Nasrallah did not mention the ongoing bombing of Lebanon: he was talking about the attacks that took place on Tuesday and Wednesday, as a result of which thousands of Lebanese were injured - both combatants and civilians alike. Considering the response to the death of one of the founders of Hezbollah, Fuad Shukri, the Lebanese are unlikely to risk a full-fledged war, which, however, is what is expected in the ultra-Orthodox government. It is much more likely that on Hezbollah’s side everything will be limited to UAV and missile strikes, with the difference that this time the launches will be much more massive.#Israel #Lebanon #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63667	2024-09-19T09:26:35-07:00

Sanctions in Tbilisi expectedly associated with the upcoming parliamentary elections in October and an attempt to spur the opposition to protest. And Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze even stated that in the event of another such step, relations with the United States could be reconsidered. However, the parties are in no hurry to break the dishes. It is not the top officials in Georgia who are subject to American sanctions, and in Tbilisi, in turn, the United States does not yet plan to physically prohibit the activities of all globalist funds and structures - we are only talking about limiting their work. Therefore, real discord in relations between countries with heated public rhetoric is still very far away. Which, however, does not prevent the ruling party of Georgia, within the framework of a balanced policy, from gradually drifting towards Russia purely for practical reasons.#Georgia #USA@rybarSupport usTACCGeorgia may reconsider its attitude towards the United States if the American side accepts sanctionsEvents in Russia and the world.

At the same time, the Israeli General Staff approved plans for the continuation of the war on the northern front. What is interesting here is that the bombing of the southern part of the Arab Republic began just minutes before the announced speech of Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, where he raised the topic of the recent Israeli hacker attack and the subsequent explosions of pagers. Despite the fact that so far the IDF is using only aviation and artillery, some media, citing Israeli media, hastened to announce the beginning of the Third Lebanese War. Some even reported the start of a ground offensive, but the movements of Israeli units have not yet been recorded. Be that as it may, in recent days, Israeli troops have dealt several significant blows to the Lebanese group. And even at the moment when Hezbollah sympathizers were expecting a speech by its secretary general, the territory of Lebanon was subjected to one of the most massive bombings. Nevertheless, Hezbollah fighters are also not sitting idly by and are launching rockets at populated areas in northern Israel. Today alone, ten IDF soldiers were injured in the region, which was one of the highest numbers for this month. And what will be the final development of events is a question that is being asked by both Arabic-language and Israeli media. But it is obvious that the degree of conflict between the IDF and Hezbollah is one of the highest in recent times. #Israel #Lebanon #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63659	2024-09-19T07:58:58-07:00

🎬🖼 🇮🇱🇮🇷 This morning the Israeli security service Shabak re...	🇮🇱🇮🇷 This morning, the Israeli security service Shabak reported the detention of 73-year-old Ashkelon resident Moti Meman, who was allegedly recruited by Iran to assassinate prominent representatives of the Israeli authorities, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant. Meman himself was arrested back in August, but the investigation lasted all this time. It is noted that the accused provided all possible assistance to the special services and even thanked them for his detention, because he was afraid of further developments. According to the investigation, Meman was recruited in April 2024, while he was in Turkey. He held several meetings with Iranian businessmen and intelligence agents, after which he carried out various assignments: from photographing IDF facilities to transferring finances to anti-Israeli groups. At the last meeting, he was asked to organize assassination attempts on various individuals, allegedly as revenge for the murder of former Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. At the same time, according to Meman, the Iranians presented this as the only way to avoid war. However, they were unable to agree on the amount of the reward, so the issue was postponed, and Meman himself went to Israel, where he was detained. 🔻It’s interesting that the Israeli media actively praise the actions of their own intelligence services, which in recent days have not only organized explosions of various devices in Lebanon and Syria, but also stopped a possible attempt at terrorist attacks. In turn, Arabic-language media perceived this news through the prism of the impending response from Iran, which has been expected since the end of July in response to the Israeli murder of the Hamas leader in Tehran. #Israel #Iran@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63654	2024-09-19T06:10:12-07:00

It recently became known that surveillance cameras at some military bases in the Republic of Korea were made in China - they are now being removed en masse and replaced with others. We are talking about 1,300 cameras, the supplier of which, as the media write, initially claimed that they were not from China. According to intelligence information, the equipment could transmit video recordings abroad when connected to some Chinese server. South Korea claims that the cameras were not installed at the most sensitive military installations, located, for example, near the demilitarized zone separating the South from the North. Observation using this equipment was carried out mainly at training grounds. 🔻There may indeed be a grain of truth in this story, especially given the situation in the region. However, it is South Korean intelligence that is in charge of solving the problem, and it has recently become the epicenter of several major scandals related, for example, to the leak of data about agents. So even if the cameras weren't actually made in China, South Korea's intelligence agencies may be trying to improve their reputation and demonstrate their usefulness to the country's population through these types of news outlets. over 1,300 Chinese-made surveillance cameras at unitsSEOUL, Sept. 13 (Yonhap) -- The military has recently taken down more than 1,300 surveilla...	https://t.me/rybar/63653	2024-09-19T05:37:34-07:00
🖼 🇦🇿🇦🇲 About the military expenditures of Armenia and Azerba...	🇦🇿🇦🇲 About military spending in Armenia and Azerbaijan The news about reducing defense spending in Azerbaijan for the coming 2025 remained unnoticed in the Russian segment. Compared to 2024, the decrease was about 6.6%.📌 In the Armenian media, this was presented as an important step that the neighbors really strive for peace. And it really seems like this: the budget is actually being reduced. But for some reason everyone forgets about the numbers. For 2024, expenses ranged from 3.5 to 3.9 billion dollars, that is, the reduction will be up to 3.1 to 3.4 billion dollars. And this is the level of expenses for 2022-2023. Now the Azerbaijanis do not need to set very high standards, because Karabakh was taken without resistance. Therefore, cutting defense spending and focusing on the social needs of the country is natural. But the amounts are still high, considering how little the Armenians have spent on their army in recent years. And it’s curious whether this minor budget cut in Azerbaijan will be presented as a demonstration of peace?❗️Logically, Baku will probably expect a similar step from the Armenians, whose military budget already looks ridiculous. But if expenses suddenly increase in Yerevan, then the neighbors will have a new reason to accuse them of militarization and disruption of all agreements. By the way, the Azerbaijanis themselves train their units with enviable regularity. Recently, training took place for two border units in the north and south of the country, and Akıncı drones operate near the Armenian borders almost without interruption.

They also do not know plans for its withdrawal, although the joint exercises in which Typhon arrived in the Philippines are ending this month.🔻Yes, such plans may suddenly appear. However, so far everything indicates that the scenario of deploying two American missile systems at once in the Asia-Pacific region is becoming more and more likely. Thus, China will be surrounded by American missiles on both sides. In this case, we should expect a response not only from China, but also from Russia - Vladimir Putin, for example, spoke about the appearance of medium-range missiles in the Philippines back in June of this year. In general, the actions of both the Americans and the Chinese could lead to the start of a new arms race in the region, for which, it seems, the preconditions are now being actively created.

It is not surprising, given that this is the first visit of the head of the German government to the region in eight years - the last time was Angela Merkel, who visited Kyrgyzstan in 2016. Also, on October 17, a summit - Central Asia - Germany - was held, as a result of which the six leaders adopted a very framework declaration, and the real result was support for Kyrgyzstan’s candidacy for the post of non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for 2027-2028.📌Separate anti-Russian media are parallel to savoring the details , who would meet the important guest at the plane's ramp, assumed that agreements would be reached on investments in energy, labor exports, and even the joining of the leaders of Central Asian states to Western peace initiatives under the so-called. Ukraine.▪️But the reality turned out to be more prosaic. The first failure occurred in Samarkand, where the German leader first arrived. Despite reaching an agreement on simplified entry for highly qualified Uzbek specialists, Scholz apparently failed to reach a compromise on the return of Afghan refugees through Uzbekistan, although this was one of the conditions of the visit. Just as it was not possible to clearly answer the question of what Germany can offer to the region.▪️The meeting of the Chancellor with the President of Kazakhstan was frankly unsuccessful, at which Kassym-Jomart Tokayev dumbfounded his German counterpart with statements that Russia could not be defeated on the battlefield, that the Istanbul Agreements were a good chance for peace, and in the end canceling the joint press conference altogether.🔻After Vladimir Putin’s statements about the consequences of attacks on Russia with long-range weapons, Central Asia clearly became nervous. The escalation will inevitably affect them too, forcing them to abandon the policy of two chairs and profits from the transit of Russian gray imports. Therefore, a kind of cold shower for the chancellor with a reminder of possible irreparable consequences turned out to be the easiest way to signal his concern.#Germany #Kazakhstan #Uzbekistan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63648	2024-09-19T01:37:58-07:00
🇦🇲🇺🇸 How the Americans are trying to sell the non-existent pr...	🇦🇲🇺🇸 How the Americans are trying to sell the non-existent project of a new nuclear power plant to the Armenians. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, speaking at the Pan-Armenian Forum in Yerevan, raised the issue of building a new nuclear power plant. Let us recall that the Armenian authorities intend to close the existing Metsamor nuclear power plant, which is maintained by Rosatom. Now its service life has been extended until 2036. According to some information, it is the West that is demanding the liquidation of the station, which generates about 40% of the electricity in the republic and provides the lowest tariffs for the population.▪️Now the key issue has become the choice of the contractor country, using the technology of which a new nuclear power plant will be built, similar to innovative small modular reactors ( MMR), which are considered safer. ▪️It is significant that Pashinyan stated that it was the Americans who made the greatest progress in the development of SMRs. However, this is clearly disingenuous, since the leaders in the field are precisely Russia and China, where stations of this type are already operating or are being built. ❗️At the same time, the Americans failed several of these projects for economic reasons. For example, last year the SMR project of NuScale Power Corp., which the United States promoted around the world, was loudly closed: its cost turned out to be 53% higher than planned.

Now from Syria itself. From the point of view of the tactics of Ukrainian formations, this is not at all surprising. Whether in Africa or the Middle East, the only goal of the Ukrainian authorities, apparently, is to -annoy- Russia. And training militants to use UAVs is really something that the Ukrainian Armed Forces can teach terrorists, given how often Ukrainian units attack Russia with various drones at different distances. Moreover, the Syrian armed forces are not nearly equipped with the air defense systems that we have, which, under certain circumstances, can create a problem for our contingent throughout Syria. At the same time, if it became known about the arrival of Ukrainian formations in Idlib, then the recent airstrikes of the Russian Aerospace Forces in this area could well have been timed to coincide with this event. دريب -النصرة- على تصنيع المسيّرات - صحيفة الوطنأكد مصدر سوري مطلع وصول 250 إدلب لتدريب مسلحي تنظيم جبهة النصرة الإرهابي على تصنيع الطائرات من دون طيار، جاء ذلك بعد يوم من كشف مصدر سوري -مطلع- أن نظام كييف سلم مجم Well done...	https://t.me/rybar/63645	2024-09-18T22:24:01-07:00

Statements about the imminent start of the third Lebanese war in In this case, they are premature: as shown by the disruption of communications and attacks on Beirut, the Israelis do not need any kind of good to start a full-fledged war. This act, rather, falls into the treasury of provocations and whipping up a degree of hysteria, so that both the Iranians and the Lebanese would strike first preemptively. Such an outcome for the Israeli elite will be most necessary: ​​it will give them a free hand. Considering that the resonance from operations in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank is no longer enough to overcome protests and discontent, and the retention of power by the ultra-Orthodox is possible in the context of an ongoing conflict and eliminating the threat, provocations will continue until war breaks out. Well, even if the Lebanese and Iranians show amazing miracles of resilience, well, the Israelis will find a reason to justify their own aggression. In this they are masters who are worth looking for. #Israel #Lebanon @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇮🇱🇱🇧 About the unexpected effect of undermining pagers and multimedia devices in Lebanon Probably, the Israeli ultra-Orthodox in power consider the plan to undermine pagers and multimedia devices to be ingenious.

In the south of the enclave, members of Palestinian forces remotely detonated a mined building, which included a group of Israeli soldiers. Four of them died. The usual raids by Israeli security forces to identify Palestinians associated with terrorists took place in the West Bank. A minor was shot dead in one of the settlements.

Apparently, the Israeli ultra-Orthodox in power consider the plan for undermining pagers and multimedia devices is brilliant. It would seem: now Lebanese society should demand revenge, pushing both Hezbollah and the Iranians to hoist the next red flags of revenge and loud words about the inevitability of retribution. If the pro-Iranian formations start something, well, the Israelis will have a reason for self-defense, freeing their hands and demonstrating to the entire world community that they are the victims of insidious adversaries. That’s just the fact that almost ordinary multimedia devices provoked justified fears among buyers of such products: how will an iPhone or Samsung fly up into thin air, which by tragic accident turned out to be from another batch, over which the Mossad conjured? To be fair, we were still talking about radio stations and pagers of certain models, but the chaos that reigned added a huge number of other devices to this row - and the popular rumor no longer began to understand.❗️And these questions hit the business reputation of companies producing high-tech devices and microelectronics. It so happens that the ultra-Orthodox, in an attempt to provoke the Lebanese, have now gained close attention from the owners of the most influential companies in the world. Well, the traditional gesheft can turn into quite a Ukrainian zrada - so you have to be able to sit in a puddle (however, no one has canceled the folk wisdom of whoever you mess with - that’s how you’ll gain).#Israel #Lebanon @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇮🇱🇱🇧 The day after remote detonation of pagers, new explosions were heard in Beirut.

This time, other devices are being reported to detonate, including cell phones, solar panels, electronic locks, car stereos, and even kitchen appliances. Videos of fires in residential buildings also appeared on social networks. Apparently, external interference was carried out in equipment with multimedia capabilities. The cyberattack affected portable radios used by the Shiite organization Hezbollah. Explosions were also heard at the funeral of the son of one of its senior members, who died yesterday in a similar attack. The media are disseminating information that all the radios were recently supplied devices from the Japanese concern ICOM. Israeli intelligence could have equipped them with explosives, just like the pagers that exploded yesterday. According to preliminary data, nine people have already died today and more than 300 were injured in the Lebanese capital, the Bekaa Valley, Nabatiyeh and other settlements in the south of the country. Speaker of the Lebanese Parliament Nabih Berri was injured. It is not yet known whether the operation to massively detonate communication devices in Lebanon is a preparation for active hostilities on the Lebanese-Israeli border. Against the backdrop of the events of the last 24 hours, the President of neighboring Syria, Bashar al-Assad, has already ordered Syrian commanders and intelligence officers to abandon two-way radios and portable communication devices. which can significantly impact the ability to communicate between departments. #Israel #Lebanon #Syria @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63632	2024-09-18T10:09:58-07:00

Krasnooktyabrskoye and Volfino are apparently in the gray zone, or have come under enemy control. Judging by the footage of the attack on the transport with ammunition, the enemy intended to deliver the ammunition directly to Krasnooktyabrsky from the New Way. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, the advance of the Russian Armed Forces south of Obukhovka is recorded. Judging by the footage of incendiary spraying from a UAV over the landings, Russian troops have made significant progress at the Viktorovka-Obukhovka line. At the same time, the release of Uspenivka, Nikolaevo-Daryino and Daryino has not yet been confirmed. Attacks by the Russian Armed Forces are also recorded southeast of Korenevo. There is also success in the fields north of Korenevo.🔻No changes in the situation have yet been observed in the Sudzhansky district. There are also reports about the work of Russian artillery in the vicinity of Orlovka and Malaya Loknya, as well as Martynovka and Plekhovo. At the same time, there is no information about attacks or advances yet, with the exception of the attack of the Armed Forces of Ukraine near Borki, which was repulsed according to the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, from where personnel continue to appear after the clearing.

The reality is, that the attack was fundamentally no different from similar drone attacks on oil refineries, airfields and other facilities. The enemy’s tactics and even types of weapons were approximately the same as during massive attacks on Russian territory with a six-month range. And the reasons for what happened are the same - a lot has been said about the problems of countering drone attacks over the past six months. There is progress in resolving these issues, but, as you can understand, there is still a lot of work to be done. And I would like to hope that it will not come down to following unfounded slogans and looking for easy ways. It is worth adding separately that the Russian Armed Forces have already faced large losses of ammunition depots in the North Military District zone - this was the case after the appearance of HIMARS and Storm Shadow in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. However, the problem was partly solved with the help, for example, of dispersing large storage facilities. Perhaps someone simply still naively believes that the combat zone is limited to new regions, the Ukrainian Armed Forces do not have their own long-range weapons, and drones were launched at oil refineries in the rear regions from the Baltic states and Kazakhstan. Oddly enough, after six months of regular raids, such beliefs are not so rare.#Tver #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63630	2024-09-18T07:54:07-07:00

The other day, Kazakh President Kasym Zhomart-Tokayev recalled the importance of the corridor and its potential benefits for all states of Central Asia and Europe, while calling it the most reliable route to Europe. Taking into account the intensification of the OTG on this track, as well as the recent visit of the German Chancellor to Kazakhstan, during which the Middle Corridor was also discussed, the Kazakh authorities decided to recall its importance for the -civilized world-.🔻As in all previous years, the main problem of the project is its scale. Its implementation requires the investment of enormous resources and time, which not everyone is ready for. However, with continued interest in this corridor and regular attempts by OTG under the auspices of Britain, we can expect real steps on this track. This will take years and it is not a fact that it will eventually reach the final stage, but the idea itself serves as an excellent bait for the Central Asian countries.#Kazakhstan #CentralAsia@rybar Support usTelegramAqorda 🇰🇿🇰🇿 According to the President, the strategic location of Kazakhstan makes it a key intraregional center trade and logistics in Eurasia🔵He noted that the Middle Corridor is currently the shortest and most reliable route to Europe with potential...	https://t.me/rybar/63629	2024-09-18T07:29:07-07:00

Of course, the meetings themselves are not new. By the way, this is already the fourth event of this kind, at which the interaction of members of the UTG in the energy sector was discussed, from standard oil and gas issues to green energy. But attention to the UTG is really increasing. If previously we heard about such a couple of times a year and all this was limited to words about the need to strengthen the union without specifics, now we are seeing the opposite - the role of the pan-Turkic bloc is growing. This time the main attention was drawn to projects affecting new routes on which they have now converged interests in the West, in particular, the Middle Corridor and the importance of infrastructure in the Caspian Sea for the development of UTG energy. We should not expect any sudden changes or a surge in activity in the implementation of global projects, given the mentality of the countries included in the bloc.

Especially considering the obsession of Western authorities not just with a monopoly over information, but with its direct control: that is, control over what information will be verified as truthful and, of course, the only possible one. 🔻What is the Russian media system doing at this time?

This is already the fifth geoclass within the framework of an international program aimed at promoting the Russian geological school abroad. We previously reported on similar classes in Ghana, Ethiopia, Mozambique and Cuba. Their common goal is to make common approaches to the study of subsoil and mineral resources in different countries, which will simplify the exploration and production of minerals in the future. Considering the amount of data on the state of subsoil in the post-Soviet space that has been lost since the 90s, the importance of this work cannot be overestimated. Especially given the increased attention of the West to rare earth metals in Central Asia (and other developing countries) and Russia’s attempts to break into new markets bypassing sanctions. Therefore, the foundation that is now being formed by Russian geologists is critically important for ensuring Russia’s national interests.

From September 16 to 19, the Mediterranean Storm exercise will be held in the TRNC. The event cannot be called large-scale. It involves only 400 people and ten units of military equipment. In addition, CN-235 and ATR-72MPA patrol aircraft are flying to support ground forces. The Turks, together with the Northern Cypriots, will conduct several small arms training, the sailors will organize patrols, and the flight crew will provide them with air support.🔻However, Less than every such teaching demonstrates the true goals of the Turks, which are very far from pacifist and which they declare at almost every opportunity. This applies to Libya, Syria and Iraq. Using the slogan -protecting sovereignty and ensuring security- is a long-worn way to designate and justify their military presence in countries of interest to Turkey. And now the Turks are allegedly helping the TRNC maintain combat capability, while straining the authorities of Cyprus.

🎬🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦 About the attack of the Ukrainian Armed Forces UAV ...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 About the Ukrainian Armed Forces UAV attack on military warehouses in Toropets. At night, Ukrainian formations launched a massive UAV attack on various targets in Russia. Air defense operated in the Bryansk, Kursk, Oryol and Smolensk regions. One of the targets was the arsenal in the city of Toropets in the Tver region. Despite official statements about the fire being the result of -falling debris-, this is obviously not the case. A partial evacuation has been announced in the district, the population is being taken to the Western Dvina. Explosions in warehouses were so powerful that they were recorded by earthquake monitoring systems. The first tremors with a magnitude of 2.8 points were recorded at 3:56, the next seven were weaker, from 2 to 2.8 points. It is curious that the warehouse struck by the enemy was at one time opened by the then deputy head of the Russian Ministry of Defense Bulgakov, who is now under investigation.

🇬🇧 About the corruption scandal involving the Prime Minister of...	🇬🇧 About the corruption scandal involving the Prime Minister of Great Britain British Prime Minister Keir Starmer found himself at the center of a scandal over gifts from the largest donor of the Labor Party to his wife. Starmer faces an investigation due to a violation of parliamentary rules, since he did not declare the fact that his donor party paid for expensive clothes for his wife Victoria. Waheed Alli, a famous media mogul and former head of the online retailer Asos, gave money for clothes and stylist services for Mrs. Starmer. He did this both before and after the prime minister took office in July 2024. The businessman is also the largest financial donor to Starmer himself. In 2024, he bought the prime minister more than £18,000 worth of clothes, glasses and watches. He also spent 20,000 pounds on the Prime Minister's accommodation during the parliamentary elections and the same on the expenses of his personal office. It can hardly be called an accident that not so long ago Wahid Alli received a pass giving him unlimited access to 10 Downing Street. Formally, only close political advisers and ministers can have such a right. It is enough to add up a few numbers to understand where such privileges came from. Alli donated £500,000 to Labour. Now, as it turns out, Wahid is also paying for the personal expenses of the Starmer family from his own pocket. Quite convenient.#UK @rybar with @oldGBRSupport usThetimesKeir Starmer breached rules over wife’s clothes bought by Lord AlliDavid Lammy insists PMs need donations to ‘look their best’ after leader breached Commons rules by failing to declare donor paid for Lady Starmer’s clothing	https://t.me/rybar/63619	2024-09-18T00:35:27-07:00

And so, the other day, a draft agreement on the construction of an oil products pipeline in the Republic of Congo was approved.▪️The agreement of intent for its construction was signed back in 2012. Subsequently, the issue was repeatedly raised, but bureaucratic obstacles in every possible way prevented the construction process from starting.📌And now, 12 years later, after the Sino-American confrontation threatens to drag Congo-Brazzaville into itself, the project was finally approved. It will run along the route Pointe Noire - Lutete - Brazzaville - Makulu-Trecot, which is less than the original plan with access to the Cameroonian border. Most likely, this will be started later.▪️To implement the project, it is planned to create a joint venture of companies with a share of 90% of the Russian side, represented by Zakneftegazstro-Prometheus, and 10% of the Congolese side, represented by the national oil company. An oil products pipeline is needed by an African country that is actively industrializing, because it needs to purchase both refined oil from Russia and sell its own (in terms of reserves of this resource, the country is in 4th place in sub-Saharan Africa).🔻In terms of importance, it can be compared with the Chinese the Niger-Benin pipeline, which has become an important part of Chinese influence in the Sahel. And the fact that this is not the first lively initiative in recent times already speaks of the trend of Russian influence returning to Africa, which cannot but rejoice.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in London on September 10-11 to begin a strategic dialogue with the new the country's Labor government. During the visit, Blinken and Starmer discussed steps to counter China, resolving the Houthi issue and relations with Israel. The key topic of the negotiations was joint assistance to the so-called. Ukraine. During the meeting, the parties confirmed their unwavering support for Kyiv and discussed further steps to mobilize military and financial resources for Ukraine, limiting Russian income to put pressure on the Kremlin, as well as restoring Independence's energy networks. On the China issue, Keir Starmer and Antony Blinken expressed concern about -China's support for Russia's defense industry- and -dangerous and destabilizing- actions by Chinese vessels in the South China Sea. Representatives of countries that continue to supply weapons to Israel also said the importance of avoiding any escalatory actions in the Middle East that could undermine the possibility of peace (ironic).🔻In general, there were no surprises.

Judging by the footage from the enemy, they are unable to enter Vesele. Russian troops are launching artillery and air strikes along the New Way and nearby settlements in the Sumy region. From the outskirts of Medvezhye, footage of burnt Ukrainian armored vehicles north of the village reappeared. It was probably destroyed during the attack of the armored group, footage of the reflection of which appeared the day before. However, the fact of attacks by the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the direction of Glushkovo is beyond doubt, as are enemy losses. 🔻Fightings also continue in the Korenevsky district. Judging by the footage of airstrikes on forests in the Orlovka area and reports from the Russian Ministry of Defense about attacks by the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the same area, the enemy still retains forces at the line to continue attacks, even taking into account the offensive of the Russian Armed Forces at Lyubimovka. In the area of ​​Malaya Loknya, Kruglenky, Orlovka and Novaya Sorochina, judging by the ongoing air and artillery strikes of the Russian Armed Forces, a high concentration of enemy forces remains. In this case, no changes in the configurations of control zones are observed. From the vicinity of the village of Borki, more and more footage is emerging of the clearing of the village from the enemy, which can confirm the liberation of the village. We also managed to clarify the situation to the west of the settlement: according to new information, the Russian Armed Forces did not enter the outskirts of Plekhovo on September 17, and the enemy was knocked out of the forest west of Borok.

On the northern flank, fighting continues in Grodovka, where Russian attack aircraft advanced on the western outskirts of the village in the area of ​​Krasnaya Street, thanks to which the enemy was driven out of the western part of the village south of the Zhuravka River. In the north of the settlement, the advance of the Russian Armed Forces is also recorded. Judging by the footage of enemy strikes, units of the Russian Armed Forces occupied buildings on Yarovaya (Stakhanov) Street. Thus, less than a third of the city remains under enemy control. The situation between Novogrodovka and Grodovka still remains hidden - the fog of war -. Enemy attacks were recorded in the area in the vicinity of Krutoy Yar, but it is still unclear whether the Ukrainian Armed Forces managed to gain a foothold there. Fighting continues to the west of Novogrodovka, and near Selidovo the enemy is actively counterattacking in the direction of Mikhailovka. 🔻In addition, for several days in a row there were messages from Ukrainsk about the successes of Russian attack aircraft. By the evening of September 17, footage appeared on the Internet with the flags of the 114th Omsbr on the headframe of the mine -Ukraine-, near the cinema -Ukraine- and school No. 12: this allows us to assert complete control over the populated area, which, judging by the panoramic footage, did not suffer much. ❗️The status of the waste heap on the western outskirts of the settlement is still in question. On the one hand, without control of a populated area, occupying and supplying positions at this height is very problematic. On the other hand, as practice shows, Ukrainian formations often seize even extremely inconvenient positions. The capture of the city itself will also allow developing an offensive in the direction of Tsukurino and Gornyak.

🇷🇺 The events of the Northern Military District became catalyst...	🇷🇺 The events of the SVO became catalysts for serious changes in various areas, be it civil society activity or an audit of the Ministry of Defense. Gradually, they begin to penetrate even where in past realities it was difficult to expect them at all - we are talking about the area of ​​public administration. The clearest example here is the actions of the authorities of the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug (KhMAO), who launched volunteer programs on the basis of the ANO - Humanitarian Volunteer Corps - . The difference from other similar practices is that local officials are required to go through them.🔻In short, employees of administrations and other structures are sent to the North Military District zone for several weeks, where they deliver essential goods to the victims, help medical staff in hospitals, or restore houses . The goal is to give those in power some idea of ​​who it really is to be THERE. Moreover, this initiative is aimed at the long term. This is not only about the personnel reserve: in fact, officials are being prepared for the return of veterans from the front, so that in front of them sit not shiny, arrogant faces, but people who have seen some things with their own eyes and experienced them on their own skin.📌 In our opinion, the idea with a full-fledged -driving- through the zone of the Northwestern District of the bureaucracy (and not hour-long trips with demonstrative distribution of -humanitarian aid-) is an extremely effective measure for improving the quality of public administration. In addition, this also allows us to partially satisfy society’s demand for social justice. I would, of course, like to see how the initiatives of the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug authorities would be adopted by other similar structures officially aimed at forming a personnel reserve. Fortunately, the region provides all the developments on this topic for free - all you have to do is take advantage of it. #Russia #KhMAO@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63604	2024-09-17T11:27:37-07:00
🇷🇺🛰 Head of the Ministry of Digital Development Maksut Shadaye...	🇷🇺🛰 Head of the Ministry of Digital Development Maksut Shadayev announced plans to create a domestic analogue of the Starlink global satellite constellation. According to him, they intend to deploy its core by 2027, and at the moment the first two launches of spacecraft have already taken place. Judging by the documents, the project is being carried out by the company Bureau-1440, which has previously carried out successful tests of data transmission using the 5G protocol and inter-satellite laser communication . In total, by 2030 it is planned to deploy 383 devices in orbit to provide space Internet services. The cost of the program will be about 445 billion rubles. Of these, almost 37.5 billion will be provided as concessional loans, and 329 billion are planned to be raised from extra-budgetary sources of financing, apparently through domestic telecommunications companies.📌 Despite the large amounts, the domestic analogue of Starlink is extremely important for providing the population with high-speed access to Internet and scientific and technological development, as well as the country's defense capability. In the future, all costs will pay off, and not only (and not even how much) from a financial point of view. It is curious that in Russia similar projects existed in the last decade, but they were in no hurry to allocate money for them. The catalyst was largely the SVO, when, against the backdrop of the use of Starlink for military purposes, the need for such a national system became obvious. #space #Russia@rybarSupport usIzvestiaOrbital authority: the project to create an analogue of Starlink in the Russian Federation will cost 445 billion It provides for the creation of a constellation of 383 satellites and will decide communication problem in remote areas of the Russian Federation	https://t.me/rybar/63603	2024-09-17T10:30:23-07:00

🔁🖼 Answer to the question: - since drones/artillerymen/signalme...	Forwarded From Turned in war 🇷🇺Answer to the question: -since drones/artillerymen/communicationists cannot be sent, then who will storm?- In the very formulation of such a question with an attack, it is not even the topic of a specific crime that comes up, but the problem in general. Assault infantry is initially an elite unit for solving the most difficult tasks that require trained specialists who have an established connection with other units - when artillery does not just hit somewhere, but at a specific point for attack aircraft to break through, when tanks do not just They set up a carousel and eliminate the enemy firing positions specifically indicated by the attack aircraft. Assault infantry is cultivated for a long time, paying in blood for experience and gaining cones, earning its authority and gaining the opportunity to make its own decisions during the assault. Now, the speakers justifying the situation literally praise the process of transforming elite units into an analogue of penal battalions: - Was he at fault or did he not complete the task, did he simply send an illiterate commander, or did he simply not like him for some reason? - Welcome to the assault company! -. And most importantly, due to the lack of people in these units, they are trying to recruit personnel there by hook or by crook, they will send airfield technicians from the Aerospace Forces, then engineers, then signalmen, then artillerymen, or the same bird operators. And this is the main problem, starting with the fact that anyone who ends up in the stormtroopers believes that he was simply sent to his death, which means that he is already initially devoid of the morality to win. Each statement - and someone needs to be sent - only lowers the level of positive attitude towards stormtroopers. With this approach, assault operations turn from achieving goals into an end in themselves. -We go on assaults every day- - but what’s the use of that? They stormed it head-on, reported that the assault was successful and okay, and that it did not lead to anything other than casualties of personnel, the main thing is a report that the planned assault was carried out. Whoever has more assaults is a great guy - a wonderful approach, but its praisers themselves do not want to participate. And what is happening is nothing new. Even Zhukov in 1942 (Directive on Losses, March 30, 1942) drew attention to unnecessary losses and ways to combat them. After all, to competently storm enemy positions, you don’t need much. Reconnaissance of positions, identification of firing and observation points, identification of mining lines. And then, before the assault, or even at the time of the advance of the assault units, artillery is fired at the identified targets, and enemy artillery is also suppressed. The stormtroopers are already storming softened positions, not encountering concentrated fire from machine guns, attached equipment and hundreds of gifts on their heads. Yes, one directive is not enough, experience was required, for which they paid at the cost of many lives; the formation of the first SISB came only a year later. Why our assault units switched from tactics that were more than 100 years old to combat tactics from the time of the Napoleonic Wars is a big question. The worse thing is that they are also praising it. It is clear that the war is about statistics: to occupy a forest belt - so many deaths, to occupy a village - a different number. Then tell me how many meters of territory was gained by sending drone pilots into attack aircraft? If there is no answer, then the process has replaced the goal.	https://t.me/rybar/63601	2024-09-17T09:54:42-07:00

Among the wounded were officers of the Lebanese group, as well as the Ambassador of the Islamic Republic of Iran to Lebanon Mojtaba Khamenei. He did not have a pager, but one of his companions had such a device. From a military point of view, what happened looks like a good preparatory measure for the long-discussed operation in southern Lebanon. Here there is a temporary disruption of closed communications within Hezbollah, injuries to the commanding staff, and, in principle, the subsequent confusion characteristic of such attacks. Another question is whether the IDF command will take advantage of the opportunity in the short term.

Volunteers from Bishkek restored the memorial to the participants of the Great Patriotic War. The monument, located in the Kirkomstrom district, not far from school No. 42, was put in order for the 80th anniversary of the victory of the peoples of the USSR in the Second World War. Children from the Timur movement of the Kyrgyz Society of Siege of Leningrad took part in the action under the leadership of the world champion in Thai boxing among amateurs Timur Kutanov and Bishkek Financial and Economic College named after. A. Toktonalieva. The purpose of the event, according to them, is to honor the feat of their ancestors and remind everyone of the importance of peace and harmony in multinational Kyrgyzstan. Let's hope that in the Russian segment they will pay attention to such actions more often.

Sabina Shoal, the ownership of which is disputed by authorities in Beijing and Manila, became one of the main points of tension in the water area in August. This is where most of the clashes between Chinese and Filipinos took place last month. The main reasons for the withdrawal of the Philippine ship were both bad weather conditions and the need to repair the ship. In addition, the Filipinos could not fully provide the ship's crew with water and food. 🔻However, in fact, the withdrawal of the ship occurred precisely because of the actions of the Chinese. Thus, the Chinese coast guard in every possible way prevented the delivery of provisions to it, and also rammed a Philippine ship, causing significant damage to it. Now Beijing can take advantage of this opportunity to consolidate its presence on the disputed shoal. Although Manila says that they can send other ships to replace it at any time, there are always Chinese ships around Sabin, whose crews do not intend to let outsiders through. Therefore, we will not be surprised if the Chinese coast guard sends even more equipment there in order to prevent any attempts by the Filipinos to gain a foothold on the shallows. Given China's reaction to any actions by the Philippines in the South China Sea, a new round of tension in the region is not far off.

As a result of the simultaneous explosion of devices in Dahiya (Hezbollah stronghold - in the capital of Lebanon) and other areas, about 500 citizens were injured. According to Israeli media, most of the victims are members of the Shiite group. Despite claims on the Internet about the presence of dead, this information has not yet been confirmed in Lebanon. Thus, an unnamed Hezbollah representative in an interview with the British publication The New Arab reported only the presence of wounded. At the same time, Syrian news resources reported the explosion of a car of pro-Iranian groups in the southwest of Damascus. According to preliminary information, we are also talking about remote detonation of a radio transmitter.#Israel #Lebanon #Syria@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63589	2024-09-17T06:55:00-07:00

And now the Japanese media are publishing the first details of the joint statement that will be adopted following the meeting. First, the parties will discuss the deployment of a new communications infrastructure in the region, which should compete with other suppliers of such equipment. We are talking here, of course, about Chinese companies - they continue to dominate the Philippine market, which does not suit the US and Japanese authorities. Secondly, the leaders of the participating countries will probably advocate joint patrolling of the waters in the region. The first such event in the QUAD format could be organized as early as 2025 with the participation of the coast guard forces of the United States, Japan, Australia and India.🔻According to media reports, the main goal of such measures is supposedly the fight against illegal fishing. However, joint patrols of the water area will clearly be used as an additional tool to deter the PRC. At the same time, from an information point of view, QUAD representatives do not even need to invent anything. Indeed, in the same publications of Western media, it is the Chinese who almost always appear as poachers engaged in illegal fishing in the region. Thus, the authors of the initiative are killing two birds with one stone - under the pretext of fighting illegal fishing, the authorities of the United States, Japan, Australia and India will demonstrate the capabilities of coordinated actions to contain China. #Australia #India #USA #Japan@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usKyodo News+Quad plans joint patrols in Indo-Pacific to counter illegal fishingJapan, the United States, Australia and India plan to launch joint patrols to monitor vessels in the Indo-Pacific , diplomatic sources say, in the latest effort by the Quad group to counter illegal fishing in waters where China's influence is growing.	https://t.me/rybar/63588	2024-09-17T05:46:17-07:00

Ukraine. In return, Qatar will receive several RCH 155 self-propelled artillery units on the Boxer armored personnel carrier wheelbase. The vehicles are planned to be repaired and transferred to the Ukrainian Armed Forces in two batches - six at the end of 2024 and six more during 2025. According to media reports, the next initiative to provide military support to the Kyiv regime will cost the German Ministry of Defense 150 million euros. As noted by Bild, this is happening against the backdrop of a delay in the sale of German ammunition to Israel, which has not been approved for almost a year despite the IDF’s urgent need for shells . However, a similar deal with the authorities in Doha, who are important sponsors of Hamas, was agreed upon in the shortest possible time. What is also funny here is that Qatar certainly does not suffer from a budget deficit, but at the expense of others it is rearming its small army. And the German taxpayer pays for everything, which the ruling traffic light coalition in Berlin has turned into one of the main sources of financing for the Kyiv regime.#Germany #Qatar #Ukraine@rybarSupport usGlobal Defense NewsBreaking News: Qatar to Supply Half Its PzH 2000 Howitzers to Ukraine After Buying German RCH 155 8x8 howitzers.According to information published by the German newspaper Bild on September 15, 2024, Germany approved the sale of advanced RCH 155 155mm wheeled se lf-propelled artillery systems to Qatar.

At the same time, Russian-speaking military personnel were transferred out of harm’s way from the base in Marculesti near Chisinau. An increase in the number of military personnel from Romania and other NATO countries is noted at the military airfield.🔻Information that cargo planes with weapons for the Ukrainian Armed Forces are already regularly received in Marculesti has appeared before. In addition, there are always Ukrainian mechanics and military personnel at the airfield who service Soviet-style helicopters. And the current modernization of the GDP and the deployment of maintenance stations can be associated with nothing more than preparations for receiving F-16 fighters. The Russian Foreign Ministry recently expressed concern about this. However, the Moldovan authorities predictably deny the facts. As we noted earlier, now Moldova and its Western curators are focused on the re-election of Maia Sandu in October. Just after the elections, we should expect more serious steps by the authorities in Chisinau to drag the country into direct conflict. Moreover, public opinion has already been prepared in advance with permission for the F-16 to fly through the territory of Moldova.#Moldova #Ukraine @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar❗️🇷🇺🇺🇦✈️ Where to catch Ukrainian F-16s?

🔁🖼 About the importance of reading books for a young growing bo...	Forwarded From Revenge of Good Will About the importance of reading books by a young, growing organism (and not only). A week ago, after watching a video with apologetic youngsters as they were called (yeah, each forehead is 20 years old), what was most infuriating was the inability of the modern younger and older generation to connect even two words in your conversation. Although no, believe me, they can connect more than two words, but this speech will be absolutely uncultured, full of swear words and slang. The main reason, as we see it, is the extremely low vocabulary of our primordially rich and powerful Russian language, which could take from books that sow rational, good, eternal things. We conducted a survey that confirms our own data, which adds up to a terrifying picture - about 40 percent of modern teenagers do not read books at all, and 25-30 percent read 1-2 books a month, and even then, most likely, as part of the school curriculum in abbreviated summary. This is negligible. We read much more in our time. One of the admins could read 2-3 books a week, read avidly, in principle thanks to books, and survived a difficult puberty period, did not contact the street, living in a not particularly prosperous area. It’s just that at one fine moment the craving for the inner world of books became stronger than the craving of the street. Books were borrowed from the library once a week and were mainly on military topics. For example, K. Simonov's trilogy - The Living and the Dead - was read in the 8th grade, and then reread several times, including in adulthood. By the way, the path to the library was mostly on foot and was 3 km in one direction. Once a week. Autumn, winter, spring. For the summer, books were taken in packs, but, however, they were read in smaller volumes. After all, it’s summer, the village, there’s not much time for them here. The second admin had an extensive parental library at hand and read at least three books a month. Modern teenagers, and adults too, are actively instilled with clip-meme thinking: short videos, meme pictures. They are easy to digest, with this type of thinking it is easy to switch between different information, but then the essence is lost due to superficial immersion. Long texts, in modern jargon longreads, people stop reading, they don’t want to think and reason, it’s easier to read the opinion or post of an expert or a trusted blogger, but the worst thing is that there is also active propaganda about the uselessness of long texts. Like, people are not interested in them, write shorter, telegram post format - for a maximum of one phone screen. This is very dangerous, people, no matter what age, stop thinking and reasoning with their minds, they memorize short theses, and that’s enough for them. Reading large amounts of text is very important both for replenishing your vocabulary and developing the ability to clearly and competently express your thoughts in adolescence, and for the ability to think, reason and draw your own conclusions as adults. Find opportunities to read yourself and force your children to read. Whoever was not lazy and read to the end - put 🆒Revenge of good will	https://t.me/rybar/63584	2024-09-17T03:31:39-07:00
🇰🇵🇰🇷 The situation on the Korean Peninsula continues to remai...	🇰🇵🇰🇷 The situation on the Korean Peninsula continues to remain tense: recently, the DPRK once again sent garbage balls to South Korean territory. Several thousand of them have already been shipped since May, and the 20th anniversary launch recently took place. Everything happens according to the standard scheme - North Korea sends -gifts-, and in South Korea they wait for them to fall on their own, so that they can then remove the waste. They fundamentally refuse to shoot down such air targets for fear of causing damage to infrastructure. Pyongyang is well aware of this and does not plan to reduce the scale of such raids. According to the latest estimates, the material damage from them for the authorities in Seoul is $140 thousand. Moreover, during the last launches of the balloons, fires broke out at least twice at the places where they fell. 🔻And although the level of public dissatisfaction with the approach of the South Korean authorities is increasing, the government is not yet going to take serious measures to combat the problem. It also does not plan to reduce the scale of propaganda against the DPRK broadcast across the border, which is the formal reason for launching garbage balloons. The authorities in Seoul could follow in the footsteps of the previous administration, which limited the provocative actions of its own activists. However, such steps do not fit into the obvious anti-North Korean policy of the current president. #DPRK #SouthKorea@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usYonhap News AgencyN.

Inspired by the digital revolution in the Russian segment of Telegram and taught by the bitter experience of Russia’s failure on the information front in the spring of 2022, the Serbs decided to assemble their own OSINT team of volunteers to map the operational situation and assess what was happening in Kosovo and Metohija. -A series of hybrid operations recently carried out in Pristina with the direct coordination of Western intelligence services clearly shows that the situation in the region can change overnight with potentially unpredictable consequences. In this regard, the collection, systematization and analysis of all available information about the enemy’s positions, movements, infrastructure, resources and capabilities can be of key importance, the guys write absolutely correctly.

Forwarded From Sex, cartels, Frida Kahlo🇺🇸🇬🇪 Speaking of -unprecedented external interference-, which is announced as a background to the future Georgian elections. English-language media, talking about how former Prime Minister Ivanishvili invited Georgians to apologize to the Ossetians for starting the 2008 war years, they presented the story in a very non-trivial style for themselves. There are no accusations of some kind of pro-Russianism - and indeed no direct criticism at all. Details are noted: that Ivanishvili said this at a rally in Gori, briefly occupied by Russia in 2008, that the West, Russia and China have their own interests there. It is stated that most of those now living in South Ossetia are ethnically different from Georgians and -they say they were forcibly absorbed into Georgia under Soviet rule-. In conclusion, a report commissioned by the EU in 2009 is mentioned, from which the words -Georgia provoked the war by attacking Tskhinvali in South Ossetia with the use of heavy equipment- were extracted. At the same time, they still quoted the words of Saakashvili’s party, which considered Ivanishvili’s statement a national disgrace that serves the interests of Russia - and left the Georgian spelling of Tskhinvali. As a result, theses have already been thrown in that can be used for:▪️Media campaigns against -Russian influence- in Georgia.▪️Media campaigns against the current Georgian elite through dispelling the guilt of Georgians before other peoples.▪️Media campaigns against the current Georgian elite through supporting opposition and revanchist sentiments within Georgia itself .Of course, the matter is not exhausted by this topic, but let’s see what kind of rhetoric will be in fact. #Georgia #USA #mediatechnology@sex_drugs_kahlo - Latin American happiness [no]TelegramRybar🇬🇪🇷🇺🇺🇸 On the eve of the parliamentary elections in Georgia scheduled for October, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said that they would be held against the backdrop of unprecedented external interference.

It seems like the other day Georgia spoke about its ability to apologize for the 2008 war and Saakashvili’s behavior.

Reports of the enemy entering the first two settlements are not confirmed by objective control personnel, while north of Medvezhiy UAV operators defeated a group of armored vehicles of the Ukrainian Armed Forces heading towards Glushkovo. ▪️In the Korenevsky district, the Russian Armed Forces are advancing, liberating Russian villages. Today, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced control over Uspenovka, but it has not yet been possible to confirm this with video materials, as well as the liberation of Darino. The only thing known for certain is the ongoing attacks of the Russian Armed Forces in the direction of populated areas. In addition, fighting is taking place in Lyubimovka, located to the north, and to the east of it, an Ukrainian Armed Forces tank was destroyed in the Zeleny Shlyakh area. ▪️In the Sudzhansky district, Russian Aerospace Forces aviation is actively working on identified enemy concentration areas near Pravda and in the vicinity of Yuzhny. In addition, official reports have appeared about the liberation of the village of Borki, but according to information from places on the western outskirts, there may be a focal presence of members of Ukrainian formations. Against this background, there is also contradictory information about the exit of assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces to the outskirts of Plekhovo.▪️On the Spalnoye-Kucherov-Ozerki section, there has been a lull for quite a long time; none of the settlements appears in reports from both sides. Probably, the territory was cleared by Russian fighters after repelling the attacks on Giryi, or some time later.▪️In the area of ​​​​the New Way, unmanned aircraft attacked Ukrainian Armed Forces equipment, which could not be identified.

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇬🇪🇩🇪 About the visit of the Chairman of the German Bundestag to Georgia, Rybar quotes the words of Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, who said that the parliamentary elections scheduled for October will be held against the backdrop of colossal Western interference. ▪️Western officials themselves indicate their aggressive intentions by threatening to punish Georgia for the law limiting foreign influence. For example, US Deputy Secretary of State Uzrya Zeya visited Tbilisi in July, where she met with representatives of Western-funded NGOs. The official actually gave them the go-ahead to prepare mass protests in the country. ▪️Right now, the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the German Bundestag, Michael Roth, is visiting Georgia, campaigning against the ruling Georgian Dream party. ▪️So, Roth states that elections should be -free and fair-. Usually this statement is not disputed. But then Roth calls the current government -anti-democratic-, which means that the elections, in which the victory of the -Georgian Dream- is possible, can be declared -undemocratic-. ▪️Moreover, Roth was already in Georgia in May and participated in protests against the law on foreign agents, which can be considered as direct foreign interference in the affairs of the state.▪️In addition, Roth criticized the recently adopted law against LGBT propaganda in Georgia. Previously, the politician attributed a destructive role to the Georgian Orthodox Church. ▪️Now Roth is again meeting with representatives of Western NGOs in Georgia, including the Georgian Young Lawyers Association, the International Society for Fair Elections and Democracy, Transparency International – Georgia, the Center for Social Justice and the Institute for Research on Democracy.▪️ The Georgian Dream party noted that they did not want to meet with Roth because of -offensive remarks about of the Georgian people and faith -.🔻Situations such as these show how the USA and the EU over many years have created an extensive network of their agents of influence and how they now unceremoniously come to them for consultations, as if on an equal footing with the government. It is obvious that Western countries and their agents do not intend to reduce the degree of their interference in the internal affairs of Georgia and will use the moment of parliamentary elections at any cost to return the country to the path of deprivation of its sovereignty. #Georgia #Germany @pezdicide no chemistry - just facts	https://t.me/rybar/63568	2024-09-16T10:00:10-07:00

Today, the Cobra Warrior event of the joint NATO air forces started over the territory of Great Britain, which will last until the beginning of October. The range of tasks during the exercise is truly extensive. There are strikes on mock enemy ships, missile launches against ground targets, repelling an air raid, and an attack as part of multinational groups. It involves both the most modern F-35 and F-16 fighters. In addition, army aviation helicopters, AWACS and refueling aircraft were involved in the exercise. The exercise itself is standard in nature, however, as has already been said more than once, their number has increased significantly compared to previous years, which is associated with growing hysteria around Russia. Thanks to the exaggerated danger, NATO is successfully increasing defense spending, producing more and more weapons and military equipment, while simultaneously developing resources beyond at the expense of their taxpayers. And exercises of this kind themselves allow you to keep your units in good shape, especially taking into account the experience of the Northern Military District, since the participation of European armies in real conflicts is limited to operations of a local nature, but not regional.

A surge in such episodes indicates the problems of the Ukrainian formations with air defense in the area. Apparently, the Ukrainian Armed Forces do not risk transferring medium- and long-range systems closer, especially against the backdrop of effective attacks by the Russian Armed Forces on HIMARS and other -fat- targets in the border area. At the same time, some of the transferred short-range enemy air defense systems were destroyed or even became trophies of the Russian troops. Which together obviously affects the air cover of the Ukrainian Armed Forces group in the occupied areas of the Kursk region. This is also another example of the fact that attack UAVs such as -Inokhodets-, -Forpost-R- or -Mohajer-6- have not lost their relevance - in the absence or Due to the insufficient density of enemy air defense, they quite effectively destroy enemy equipment.#Kursk #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63566	2024-09-16T07:22:19-07:00

Forwarded From Two MajorsMilitary preparations of ⚡️NATO countries for global conflicts of the futureThe German Institute of World Economics in Kiel (IfW) published a report -Readiness for war in decades: the slow rearmament of Europe and Germany in relation to Russia -, &nbsp; in which it states the unpreparedness of the military-industrial complex of 🇩🇪Germany, 🇫🇷 France, 🇬🇧Britain and 🇵🇱Poland for confrontation with 🇷🇺Russia.&nbsp; Despite the customized nature of the study, the data provided allowed us to draw useful conclusions: ▪️the desire to supply the Ukrainian Armed Forces with shells has not yet resulted in an explosive increase in production: the Bundeswehr was able to order the supply of only 372.7 thousand 155 mm shells in 2023-2024 together with 🇩🇰 Denmark , 🇪🇪Estonia and 🇳🇱Netherlands and within the framework of the European Initiative, as well as 148 thousand 120 mm tank ammunition. Delivery of these shells will take from two to five years;▪️production volumes affect the decline&nbsp; ammunition prices: 155 mm shells purchased by the Bundeswehr in 2024 cost 2.7 thousand euros, a year earlier - 4.08 thousand euros, in 2020 - about 6 thousand euros;▪️despite the increase in purchases of military equipment after the start SVO (from January 2020 to July 2024, Germany made 187 orders worth 137.6 billion euros, of which from March 2022 to July 2024 there were 122 orders worth 89.9 billion euros) current production and procurement volumes will allow for restoration parity with the Russian Federation only after decades, and in some categories up to a hundred;▪️there is a reorientation towards strengthening the ground forces: half of all&nbsp; German military procurement since 2022 has been aimed at supplying ground units of the Bundeswehr.&nbsp; The time of compact armies is a thing of the past; ▪️surprising was the lack of data on increasing costs for the purchase of unmanned systems.&nbsp; Instead, Germany ordered 35 fifth-generation F-35 aircraft in 2022.▪️ Until 2024, a significant part of German military purchases went only to replace the weapons supplied to Ukraine, but now the focus is on restoring its own capabilities.✨Such publications in the West are used to prepare public opinions on the rapid waste of governments on military purchases. Well, when the contracts are completed and NATO warehouses are full, it will be difficult to stop the military machine, which brings super-profits to the owners of transnational military-industrial complexes.

Thus, in the Yemeni province of Damar, the Houthi air defense neutralized the tenth Reaper since the beginning of the escalation in Palestine and Israel. Taking into account the cost of one individual strike and reconnaissance drone at $30 million, in total the Yemeni fighters in slippers have accumulated such UAVs in the amount of $310 million.🔻Given the number of American drones intercepted by the Houthis, who do not have high technological capabilities, it is quite the reputation of the most consistent defenders of the Palestinian people has been successfully established. In this matter, the Yemenis can be envied: it is enough to compare how comfortable American reconnaissance UAVs feel over the same Black Sea and how the issue of foreign presence in the airspace of the poor republic is resolved by the Ansaralli fighters.📌It is also worth It should be noted that in addition to the downed UAVs, the Yemenis have plenty of reasons to rejoice: just yesterday they struck the central part of Israel. The launched rocket flew approximately 2000 km and fell in an open area. The Israelis failed to intercept it. Most likely, as part of a symbolic response, the United States will bomb the territory of Yemen, but it is more likely to again be ineffective: during the years of the war, Ansarallah managed to build a network of underground bases, at the same time establishing false launch positions on the surface.

The Fano rebels, who rebelled against the oppression of the Amhara people, achieved great success over the last month.▪️So, during the fighting from August to September, they reached the border with Sudan through the city of Matema. Ethiopian troops, finding themselves pressed against the territory of another state, surrendered to the Amharians. After this, the rebels continued their movement, occupying the abandoned headquarters of the armed forces in Shinfa.▪️In the center of Amhara, the Amharas also made progress. Between Gondar and Bahir Dar they occupied six waders (zones), in which local representatives were elected by popular vote. -Fano - thus receives support from the people, showing that they are not thugs, as they are portrayed in the local media. There is also a response among the population who join the ranks of the rebels. So, from mid-summer, designations of Amharic army corps began to appear in reports, which means an increase in the number in the ranks of Fano.▪️At this time, the Ethiopian authorities are busy escalating relations with Somalia. After an international scandal related to the initiative to lease the port of Berbera in unrecognized Somaliland, the parties did not stop and are in the final stage before signing a memorandum.🔻As we wrote earlier, all this pressure on the Somali authorities and negotiations with Somaliland is just a way to find an external enemy for unity peoples of Ethiopia.

Despite the fact that the Americans accuse the al-Sisi regime of human rights violations, they have to admit that the Egyptian authorities are the guarantor of security in Africa and the Middle East. The merits of the leadership in Cairo as a mediator in negotiations between Israel and Hamas were mainly noted. At the same time, the Egyptian side does not need to strengthen the army in this direction. But Egyptian support for Somalia, which is being pressured by the Ethiopian authorities, is a more likely goal. The Americans have long wanted to curtail the African Union mission in the country, since they are the main sponsors, but they don’t see the point in it. And then, recently, the Egyptian authorities appeared, offering 10 thousand military personnel and supplies of weapons. Of course, the main funds will go to modernize the Egyptian armed forces, but some of them will still go to equip the military infrastructure in Somalia.🔻Probably, the American leadership is like this will try to appease Egypt and maintain its position in Somalia with a new mediator, but time will tell what will come of it.#Africa #Egypt #Somalia #USA #Ethiopia@rybarSupport usReutersUS grants Egypt $1.3 billion in military aid, overriding rights conditionsThe Biden administration is overriding human rights conditions on military aid to Egypt, a State Department spokesperson said on Wednesday, granting the U.S. ally its full allocation of $1.3 billion this year for the first time during this administration…	https://t.me/rybar/63562	2024-09-16T03:15:40-07:00
🇹🇲🇮🇷🇹🇷 About Turkmenistan’s next attempts to break into new...	🇹🇲🇮🇷🇹🇷 On Turkmenistan’s next attempts to break into new gas markets, Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov recently held talks with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in Tehran. Among the documents signed: memorandums of understanding between Turkmengaz and the National Gas Company of Iran, as well as between the ports of Turkmenbashi and Amirabad. Iranian media call the documents -strategic-. Why became clear after Berdymukhamedov returned from Tehran. Chairman Khalk Maslahaty said that gas supplies to Iran will be increased to 40 billion cubic meters per year. Moreover, just this July, both countries agreed on supplies of up to 10 billion cubic meters of gas per year, and the entire gas production in Turkmenistan over the past year amounted to 76 billion cubic meters. In the near future, under the swap scheme, it is planned to export Turkmen natural gas to Iraq and further to Turkey. 🔻It is important for Ankara to resolve the issue of importing Turkmen gas, and there is mutual interest here. Currently, the buyers of Turkmen gas are China, Iran and Russia. However, the growth rate of China's economy is declining, and therefore Ashgabat hopes to redirect gas to European markets: attempts to approach these projects previously failed before they began. Ankara's plans include turning Turkey into a regional gas hub. In July, Turkish Energy Minister Alparslan Bayraktar already said that the agreement on swap supplies with Ashgabat was nearing completion. If Berdimuhamedov really agreed with Tehran, then Ankara's plans are close to implementation. #Turkmenistan #Iran #Turkey #Central Asia #economy@rybarSupport usIRNA RussianPresident: strategic agreements have been reached between Iran and TurkmenistanTehran, August 28, IRNA - The President said that between Iran and Turkmenistan Turkmenistan reached strategic agreements.	https://t.me/rybar/63560	2024-09-16T00:23:44-07:00

Units of the Russian Armed Forces managed to expand the zone of control both in the Grigorovka area in the north and to the west of Kleshcheevka.▪️Russian troops knocked out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from several positions north of Zheleznodorozhny (Zaliznyansky), reviving the frozen section of the front. Taking into account the geographical features of the area and information from our sources, we can say that at the moment the advance of Russian troops is significantly greater than what can be confirmed by the available personnel. ▪️Southwest of Grigorovka, Russian attack aircraft have made significant progress, taking control of a forested area and physically cutting off one of the roads leading to the village. The Russian Ministry of Defense also announced the liberation of the settlement, which, apparently, will be confirmed by the relevant personnel in the near future.▪️To the south, units of Russian troops crossed the Seversky Donets-Donbass canal and liberated a significant part of Kalinovo, gaining a foothold in apartment buildings. The village became the site of fierce battles because of its importance for the Armed Forces of Ukraine - the occupation of positions by the Russian Armed Forces in this area will allow them to launch an offensive to the south, bypassing the enemy’s defensive lines in the Oktyabrsky microdistrict in Chasovoy Yar. ❗️Russian attack aircraft are methodically clearing the positions of Ukrainian formations, using all available means to do this. During one of these operations, a fighter of the Russian Armed Forces destroyed personnel at a stronghold of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, equipped in a pipe under a railway bridge, by throwing a backpack with an anti-tank mine inside. Despite the certain danger of using anti-tank mines in this way, the tactic is becoming increasingly widespread among Russian assault groups. ▪️To the northwest of Kleshcheevka, the command of the Russian Armed Forces is conducting an offensive with the goal of knocking out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from the left bank and reaching a wide front towards the canal bed. During a series of battles in this area, Russian troops ousted Ukrainian formations from several forest belts. Now they are faced with the task of storming enemy positions in the forest to the west, control of which is necessary to cross the canal in several places. ▪️At the same time, the Russian Armed Forces regularly strike military infrastructure behind enemy lines. Yesterday, the Russian Aerospace Forces struck the territory of the carriage depot in Konstantinovka. According to some reports, the facility was used as a repair base and a storage place for Ukrainian Armed Forces equipment.

Take former Prime Minister Bidzin Ivanishvili: he recently spoke about the Nuremberg Trials for Saakashvili’s movement, and yesterday he announced the country’s readiness to apologize to the Ossetians for starting the 2008 war. The topic of the 08.08.08 conflict still remains a sore point for some Georgian society. Here the authorities are trying not only to satisfy the request for punishment of those responsible for the defeat, but also to present it under the sauce of condemnation of the fratricidal war with the inhabitants of the territories that Tbilisi officially continues to consider as their own. Such gestures also fit into the rhetoric of officials about plans for a peaceful return to the Abkhazia and South Ossetia. They are well aware of the degree of realism of such a scenario, but in current realities such statements look much more profitable than threats against Russia and promises to resolve the issue by military means. It is not worth seeing pro-Russian gestures in Ivanishvili’s statements: statements about possible apologies to the Ossetians - in First of all, pre-election domestic political history.

At the same time, the Russian Armed Forces managed to break through the defenses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the vicinity of Ukrainsk and occupy most of the city. ▪️In Grodovka, Ukrainian formations hold positions on the left bank of the Zhuravka River. The defense of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in this area relies on a network of fortifications to the north of the settlement, located above it relative to the terrain. This allows the enemy to conduct visual surveillance of the approaches to the village. ▪️South of Nikolaevka, the Armed Forces of Ukraine launched a counterattack towards Krutoy Yar in order to prevent the Russian Armed Forces from consolidating in the populated area. Russian units retreated to forest belts south of the settlement, where they regrouped. Considering that the enemy’s positions in Kruty Yar are practically semi-surrounded, we should expect renewed attacks by Russian troops in this area in the near future. ▪️The situation in the Novogrodovka area remains steadily tense. According to available data, Ukrainian formations are refraining from counterattacks and are preparing defenses at the Lysivka-Vyshneve line. In the area of ​​the waste heap of the Novogrodovskaya No. 2 mine, fighting continues; information about the status of the object has not appeared at the moment. ▪️To the south, units of the Russian Armed Forces are fighting in Selidovo and its surroundings. The battle line runs along Gogol and Krinichnaya streets, to the west of which the Ukrainian Armed Forces have organized a defense line in a block of multi-storey buildings. ▪️To the southwest of Mikhailovka, fighting continues in the area of ​​the previously destroyed railway bridge. Neither side, judging by the footage of objective control, was able to establish control over the railway line. The success of Russian troops in this sector will allow them to secure the southern flank of the Russian Armed Forces group fighting for Selidovo. ▪️Stormtroopers of the Russian Armed Forces pushed through the defenses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine north-west of Ukrainsk, going to the rear of the enemy troops defending in the city. After this, the Russian Armed Forces, in a series of attacks, knocked out the enemy from most of the settlement. Separate units of Ukrainian formations are still defending on the western outskirts of the city and on the waste heap of the -Ukraine- mine. ▪️Russian troops are methodically knocking out key enemy transport infrastructure facilities in Pokrovsk and its surroundings. On the evening of September 13, the Russian Armed Forces launched a missile strike that destroyed several spans of the Eastern Overpass, a key transport artery through which the Mirnograd garrison was supplied. Together with the destruction of the earlier Mirnograd overpass, this creates a threatening situation for the supply system of the Armed Forces of Ukraine throughout the entire agglomeration.

🔁 ‼️The West wants to progressively, according to Ukrainian patt...	Forwarded From Senator Dzhabarov‼️The West wants to progressively, according to Ukrainian patterns, turn the countries of Central Asia into an instrument of constant pressure on Russia. To this end, everything is being done to sever historical, humanitarian, and economic ties between states. This rut ​​falls into the use of educational institutions, which, with the help of books and teaching aids, introduce Russophobic myths about -colonizers-. Where we are talking about the negative image of Russia, of course, pro-Western non-governmental organizations are involved. The curators of these NGOs want to re-educate a new generation of young people in post-Soviet countries. They are trying to influence processes in academic humanities, lobbying for the release of certain manuals, and so on. But, despite the presence of Russophobic formulations in textbooks, any resident of the countries of Central Asia who is really interested in history will find it difficult to deny that peoples along their historical path interacted with their neighbors in one form or another. And many modern peoples once lived in composition of other states. Even Rus' was once a vassal of the Golden Horde. And the ancestors of modern Uzbeks were related to the empire of Tamerlane. Or the Kazakhs who lived in the White Horde, but later became part of the Russian Empire. As for the Soviet period, the republics enjoyed privileges. If someone claims that resources were simply siphoned off from the national outskirts, then this is fundamentally wrong. In Soviet times, we all lived together, the entire territory of the country developed more or less evenly. At the same time, the republics were subsidized, attention was paid to culture, science, their educational centers, and academies of sciences. All this was done through the redistribution of funds from the budgets of the RSFSR and the Ukrainian SSR. And after the collapse of the USSR, science in some new states was suddenly not needed. Because only a large state can afford some things. I think that at the present stage we need not to revise the past, but to deal with the present and look to the future. In this regard, we are very pleased, for example, with absolutely confidential communication between President Putin and Uzbek leader Shavkat Mirziyoyev. The worst scenario for Central Asia is its transformation into an arena for geopolitical games of the West. Our priority is maintaining stability in this region. Therefore, Russia will continue to develop strategic partnerships with its neighbors. This should also apply to the interaction between educational and scientific institutions, including so that there are fewer discrepancies in the understanding of important events of our common history.➡️ Senator DzhabarovTelegramRybar🇷🇺🇰🇿🇰🇬🇺🇿🇹🇯 How Russia is represented in Central Asian history textbooks INION RAS recently published a work on a current topic - image Russia in history textbooks in Central Asia (without Turkmenistan) and Azerbaijan.

Can you understand why the Kazakh Natsik was taught to hate Russians according to the Anglo-American program? He burned instantly. Think a little, don't look at the answer right away. Correct answer: Russian scientists, as native speakers of the Russian language, when using the word -Central Asia, had and still mean the subtlest connotation -Sredinnaya-, without averaging anything or anyone. In the same way, modern Ukrainian Nazis do not understand the proud word -Little Russia-, having deprived themselves of the richness of the Russian language, which is very precise in its meaning settings: for example, when Russians say -Small Circle- (communication, friends, management), it means the very, very central, especially trusted. Therefore, only Nazis trained in Central Asia can be offended by -Central Asia, and those who study according to the training manual -Little Russia / Little Britain- can be offended by -Little Russia. https://t.me/MedvedevVesti/18623TelegramAndrey MedvedevHmmm...Alma-Ata or Almaty?

🇺🇸🇻🇪🇪🇸 It is noteworthy that the disclosure of another CIA ...	🇺🇸🇻🇪🇪🇸 It is noteworthy that the disclosure of another CIA conspiracy occurred exactly during the period of worsening relations between Washington and Caracas. The appeal of the Venezuelan authorities to Spanish intelligence also appears here for a reason. This week, the Bolivarian Republic recalled the ambassador from Spain for consultations and summoned the Spanish ambassador to the Foreign Ministry for explanations: it turns out that the opposition candidate and main rival of Nicolas Maduro in the last presidential elections, Edmundo Gonzalez, arrived in Spain and has already met with the prime minister. Subsequently, the Spanish authorities accused the Maduro government is in a dictatorship. The arrest of citizens of unfriendly states (especially Americans) who are in the country under very murky circumstances is one of the methods available to the Venezuelan authorities not even to respond to the latest US sanctions, but rather to maintain the degree of the ongoing dialogue. Yes, it was dialogue - sanctions from the United States against the leadership of the Venezuelan Supreme Court, which confirmed the legitimacy of Nicolas Maduro, were a matter of time, and the impending seizure of the plane in the Dominican Republic was known almost in the spring. This was not something shocking for the Venezuelan leadership, but in the Western media it looked quite threatening. For its part, the Venezuelan Prosecutor General's Office issued an arrest warrant for Gonzalez - however, he was allowed to leave the country and fly to Spain, where he predictably engaged in propaganda against the team Maduro. So the current accusations of a conspiracy -to assassinate the top Venezuelan leadership - are quite consistent with the official -crisis- between the countries. And American citizens in a Caracas prison are an excellent opportunity for new contacts, allowing you to balance on the line between -a difficult situation- and -diplomatic success- for as long as necessary. 🇻🇪🇺🇸Venezuelan authorities have detained six foreigners on suspicion of plotting to assassinate President Nicolas Maduro and other Venezuelan politicians.

Forwarded From Sex, cartels, Frida Kahlo🇻🇪🇺🇸Venezuela authorities detained six foreigners on suspicion of plotting to assassinate President Nicolas Maduro and other Venezuelan politicians. Among those who are now exploring the world of Caracas prisons is, predictably, a US Marine. The Venezuelan Ministry of Internal Affairs has already reported that these comrades participated in a special operation that was allegedly organized by the CIA (well, who else?). Together with the thugs, 400 American rifles were confiscated - which were also supposed to be used in this case. Also from Venezuela they report, that among the conspirators are three Americans, two citizens of Spain (on the basis of this it has already been stated that Spanish intelligence is involved in what is happening) and one Czech. The State Department has so far confirmed the arrest of only one of its citizens, but is aware of unconfirmed reports of the detention of two more. All accusations by the Venezuelan authorities are rejected as -categorically false-. The Spanish embassy is still asking Caracas for official information on the case, and is also trying to provide access to its citizens. At the moment, it is known that the Spaniards were photographing something in Puerto Ayacucho, south of Caracas, and they even seemed to admit that they were looking for a group of mercenaries to deliver them to the Bolivarian Republic and entrust the liquidation of Maduro and the entire top leadership of the country .Basically, I expected something similar. A couple of days ago, the United States just introduced sanctions against those Venezuelan officials who still managed to get by without them. A little earlier, Maduro’s plane was seized in the Dominican Republic. The answer to all this has been asking for a long time, and this is not the first time that local authorities have arrested foreigners on charges of espionage - this especially often happens in the border areas. In the future, these people can become an excellent pretext for announcing the next negotiations between Caracas and the White House.#Venezuela #USA@sex_drugs_kahlo - Latin American happiness [no]CNNVenezuela afirma que un infante de Marina de EE.UU. está entre los extranjeros detenidos por una supuesta -operación- de la CIA…Venezuela dice que detuvo a seis extranjeros, incluido un infante de Marina de EE.UU., por un supuesto complot para -desestabilizar- el país.	https://t.me/rybar/63540	2024-09-15T07:19:34-07:00

It is noteworthy that the missile flew about two thousand kilometers, and it took Israeli air defense systems quite a long time to intercept it. At the same time, several anti-aircraft missiles hit civilian targets, including the Paatei Modiin railway station. Amid the attack, an air raid alert was declared in more than 20 locations in central Israel. Nine people were injured on the way to shelters. Fires also broke out in several places; four fire brigades were involved in extinguishing them. 🔻In turn, Houthi speaker Yahya Sari shared some details of the attack. According to him, a hypersonic ballistic missile was used for the strike, the target of which was a certain object in the Israeli port of Jaffa. The ammunition itself covered a distance of more than 2,000 km in 11.5 minutes. At the same time, the attack was associated with an Israeli air strike on the port of Al-Hodeidah that occurred in the second half of July, which killed six people and injured more than 80 others in various ways. degree of severity. 📌 Be that as it may, this is not the first time that the Houthis have demonstrated their ability to hit targets on Israeli territory: previously, the missiles they launched had already reached Eilat, and in July, a Yemeni UAV - Yafa - fell on the El Al building in Tel -Aviva, leading to the death of one Israeli and the injuries of ten more. What happened once again increased the authority of the Yemeni fighters in slippers as defenders of the Palestinian people, while in Israel itself the attack is already being actively used by the opposition to accuse the current ultra-Orthodox government of inability not only to solve the problem of shelling from the south of Lebanon, but also powerless against the threat of the Houthis. Well, the Israeli command will need to give an explanation of what happened. If previously, to combat such attacks, the Israelis had repeatedly scrambled fighter jets and shot down missiles from drones over the Red Sea south of Eilat, this time the same was not done.

The air defense forces of the Russian Armed Forces intercepted 29 targets in the country's airspace, most of them were shot down over the Bryansk region. The presence of Ukrainian Armed Forces drones was also recorded in the Oryol, Kursk, Belgorod, Kaluga and Rostov regions. Part of the UAV was intercepted by air defense units over the Roslavl and Smolensk districts of the Smolensk region. Based on available information, no one was injured. 🔻Today’s raid by the Armed Forces of Ukraine was probably intended to reveal the positional areas of the Russian air defense forces and develop a route for a new attack on Russia’s critical infrastructure. Such attacks can be counteracted by striking the enemy’s military infrastructure, which ensures mass production of UAVs.

Blinken announced this in May, at the same time allocating more than $100 million to Sandu’s office for the presidential campaign. ▪️The opposition in Moldova is already recording violations of the Central Election Commission, which turns a blind eye to Sandu’s use of administrative resources during his campaign. After all, it is the American USAID that manages the Central Election Commission of Moldova in manual mode.▪️Finally, in Moldova, in recent years, a lot of Russian-language websites and channels have been blocked, political parties have been banned, and the diplomatic corps of the Russian Federation has also been reduced, accusing embassy employees of espionage using antennas on the roof. 🔻It is obvious that Sandu’s office and his American curators, even after such purges of the political and media field, feel enormous uncertainty about the stability of the course being imposed on Moldova. Therefore, as the election date approaches, we should expect other attempts to curtail the civil rights of the population.#Moldova #Russia #USA @rybarSupport usUnited States Department of StateSecretary Antony J.

Such footage was widely circulated in Arabic-language media and was used as confirmation of the IDF's intentions to launch a ground operation against Hezbollah in the near future. At the same time, the Israeli media came out in support of these actions. Later, the IDF press service denied the distribution of the leaflets. As it turned out, the announcement of evacuation from the Al-Wazzani area was a private initiative of one of the Israeli brigades, which was not coordinated with representatives of the command. Nevertheless, the leaflets did lead to the expected result: some residents of the area left their homes and went north. However, this is not surprising, given the constant shelling of the Israelis and the increased risk of an IDF offensive - and the Lebanese are well aware of its consequences from the example of what is happening in the Gaza Strip. #Israel #Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63536	2024-09-15T03:26:31-07:00

The United States is adventurously imposing on Armenia the construction of a new nuclear power plant using American technologies to replace the Soviet Metsamor nuclear power plant. Nuclear energy, which powers almost the entire republic, is now serviced by the Russian Rosatom. ▪️Blinken’s statements about support for the democratic development of Armenia could not be avoided. Just during the days of Blinken’s negotiations with Pashinyan, the Americans increased USAID funding from $120 million to $250 million. The stated purpose of the funds is to contribute to the economic sustainability of Armenia.▪️Although lately everything has been very good with the Armenian economy, but thanks to trade within the EAEU. The Armenian economy is critically tied to Russia, but the Americans are already openly declaring that their main task is to break the connection between Yerevan and Moscow. 🔻So American money for Armenia is another bribe to Pashinyan’s team. Moreover, on the eve of the US presidential elections, it is important for Washington to once again indicate the seriousness of its intentions in the region. The Americans, in the struggle to oust Russia from the Transcaucasus, are systematically depriving Armenia of its sovereignty, penetrating all the most important state institutions, working on, among other things, the energy issue. #Armenia #Russia #USA @rybarSupport usARMENPRESS Armenian News AgencyAnthony Blinken reaffirmed the importance of a stable and dignified peace between Armenia and AzerbaijanThe US Department of State presented details of a telephone conversation between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan.How...	https://t.me/rybar/63535	2024-09-15T02:35:08-07:00

This included texts on the countries of the foreign East, in which we found a lot of interesting things.▪️Kazakh textbooks indicate that the territories of Central Asia ended up being part of the Russian Empire due to treaty relations. But so much the worse for Russia, since it deceived the Kazakhs: it did not help in the war with Dzungaria, and then began a colonial policy: the Kazakhs lost their statehood, which was a manifestation of a gross violation of the conditions for the Kazakhs to accept Russian citizenship. By the 20th century, Kazakhstan began to turn into a multinational province of Russia, and the people, most of whose lands were taken away, left ethnic territories in search of a better life, and the very existence of the Kazakh nation became an acute problem - hence the positive attitude towards the national liberation movement. Soviet Kazakhstan, which had no rights and remained one of the provinces, also distinguished itself by repressions against cultural figures and the formation of economic dependence on the metropolis. It is noteworthy to mention Solzhenitsyn’s article -How can we develop Russia?-, in which Moscow’s claims to northern Kazakhstan are seen - hence the attention in modules on modern history to the transfer of the capital to Akmola (Astana).▪️Kyrgyz textbooks turned out to be the most favorable to Russia. They reflect different reflections on the accession of the north and south to the Empire: if for the northerners Russia became a savior from the oppressors from the Kokand Khanate, then for the southerners closely associated with Kokand its arrival became a conquest. However, the salvation turns out to be imaginary: the naive Kyrgyz did not realize that the Russian Empire had the goal of colonizing the entire territory of Kyrgyzstan. The arrival of Soviet power, which ensured the development of the national economy, is seen as salvation from Urkun (the exodus of the Kyrgyz to China after the 1916 uprising). As the authors of the review summarize, in the history of Kyrgyzstan there is no place for Russia as an enemy and colonialist; it is portrayed as a friend and strategic partner.▪️ Uzbekistan looks at the consequences of joining Russia in the context of preserving its own civilizational heritage. Through this prism, the arrival of the Russian Empire looks like an attack on traditions, for the preservation of which thousands of faithful sons of the people of Uzbekistan sacrificed their lives... The authors position themselves as fighters against the myth of the civilizational mission of Russia and the USSR: any imperialist state tries to justify its wars of conquest various propaganda myths such as that it brings progress and civilization to the conquered peoples, liberates them from despotism, as well as voluntary accession to metropolises, etc. ▪️ Tajik textbooks are the most controversial. It is recognized that the imperial and Soviet periods were an important stage of modernization necessary for the creation of a modern Tajik nation-state. However, it was with the advent of Russia that the Tajik people became divided and cut off from their roots. The turning point for the Tajiks was the fall of the Bukhara Emirate, plundered by the Bolsheviks, after which the forced separation of the Tajiks from the Islamic world and its culture ended and their introduction through Russia to Western technological values ​​began... Tsarist Russia conquered the body, and the Marxism-Leninism of the Bolsheviks took possession of the minds of the Tajiks, but the heart remained unconquered...🔻 In general, textbooks explain the motives for the annexation of Central Asia by economic and colonial expansion, which caused enormous damage to the cultural heritage and former statehood. Therefore, even Soviet modernization does not justify the suffering endured. In rare cases, accusations are brought not against the Russian state, but against Russians as a whole. However, it is clear that the soil for further incitement of hatred towards Russia has been sufficiently fertilized. #Kazakhstan #Uzbekistan #Tajikistan #Kyrgyzstan #Central Asia @rybarSupport usTelegram OBPV INION RAS An abstract collection has been published - Russia in the history textbooks of the countries of the Middle and Post-Soviet East, China -.

🖼 🇳🇪 Situation in Niger: continuation of counter-terrorism ope...	🇳🇪 Situation in Niger: continuation of counter-terrorism operations Summary for August 21 - September 14, 2024 In recent months, the armed forces of Niger have been increasingly active and regularly conduct counter-terrorism operations. 🔻At the beginning of September, they reported the detention of more than 200 people associated with terrorist groups. In the Abala region on the border with Mali, IS cells were destroyed: the militants were too active in collecting tribute from the residents of the surrounding villages, which attracted attention. Vehicles carrying explosive components were detained at the border with Burkina Faso. Apparently, the militants were preparing a relatively large offensive, which is indirectly confirmed by the attacks in the west of the country. At this time, terrorists are blocking some routes from other Sahel countries. In parallel, the authorities in Niamey are pursuing an active foreign policy, which the Americans are actively using, trying to promote their influence through contacts with officials. Recently, a US congressional delegation met with members of Niger's military circles, ostensibly to discuss security and intelligence. At the regional level, relations have been warming with countries in the Economic Community of West African Development (ECOWAS). A meeting took place between the chiefs of staff of Niger and Nigeria, during which they discussed the joint fight against terrorism near Lake Chad. In addition to this, Azerbaijani companies are active: for example, representatives of Azer Gold discussed security issues and the purchase of mines in the country with the authorities. This is especially noteworthy given the fact that the Turkish PMC SADAT is already operating in Niger.❗️This situation once again raises the obvious question of when to expect similar Russian economic activity in Niger. Because the longer we are stuck in bureaucracy and slowness, the more space is taken up by third players, and the more the window of opportunity for such activities shrinks.

🔁 In light of the instructions of the Minister of Defense publis...	Forwarded From Philologist in AmbushIn light of the order of the Minister of Defense (I quote) published by the press service of the Ministry of Defense (I quote) to quickly understand the situation related to the information about the death of two servicemen with the call signs Ernest and Goodwin of the 87th Separate Infantry Regiment, I would like to note the following moments. As we all understand, the case was able to give such a loud resonance due to the fact that Ernest and Goodwin were fairly well-known specialists in professional circles, many knew them personally (I met Goodwin and Hedgehog in June of this year.) Meanwhile The assault group sent to Lesovka in the early morning of September 11 included five specialists from that same long-range air reconnaissance team: Ernest, Goodwin, Socrates, Shock and Reef. In addition, the regiment commander also tried to send Zhenya Yozhik on this one-way assault run (now, thank God, she is already in relative safety). Moreover, the assault group itself consisted of at least 12 people (this figure is known to me as of the day of receipt combat mission group). The North Wind channel, which was led by Goodwin, now indicates that 14 people died on the mission. That is, in addition to the purposeful sending of Ernest’s crew for slaughter, we have another example of an unsecured meat assault, and in this case due to a false report about the capture of Lesovka. Further, based on the available data, including a certificate prepared by Ernest himself, and messages from other military personnel (see, for example, here and here), regiment commander Puzik (Evil) was generally noted for criminal abuse of official position and poor organization of combat work. To understand the state of the regiment (I quote): -This dispatch [of Ernest’s crew for the assault] is a personal score. But the boys are dying. The losses are huge. He wiped out the regiment. There is no one. The battalion commander was wounded in Lesovka, there were five hundred deputy battalion commanders. Disabled people are persecuted and everything else. No regiment. It is not capable of carrying out this task. However, the matter is not limited to this particular regiment. According to the 1st Slavic Motorized Rifle Brigade, under the operational subordination of the 87th OSP, there are similar signals of a blatantly irresponsible attitude towards specialists, including the disbandment of a group of UAV operators 268 1st rifle battalion and transfer of engineers from the 1st reserve battalion of the brigade to the infantry. Plus, combat work in the brigade during the Northern Military District was, in principle, organized in such a way that the once famous 1st Slavic Motorized Rifle Brigade was completely turned (literally) into a meat factory. Moreover, at the level of the entire 51st Donetsk Combined Arms Army (the former 1st Donetsk Army Corps), which includes the 1st Slavic Motorized Rifle Brigade, generally has a very eloquent message: -We don’t need smart people, we ourselves are smart.- We need assaults, meat - (quotes from great commanders). In general, the frankly criminal practice of sending valuable specialists to the assault infantry (both due to a lack of personnel and due to personal hostility on the part of the commanders) is, in principle, systemic in nature in the army. Unsupported meat assaults carried out in emergency mode, including as a result of false reports about the capture of certain positions and settlements, are also a systemic problem, as well as the sending of untreated wounded, sick, disabled and simply untrained fighters to such assaults due to a lack of personal composition. This case, as I said above, highlighted almost the entire range of problems within and around our active army. With the proper approach to the investigation (taking into account the reaction of the Minister of Defense), it could become a precedent for the systematic clearing of all these Augean stables.	https://t.me/rybar/63532	2024-09-14T23:10:06-07:00

Forwarded From the Fifth Republic French novelist Michel Houellebecq revealed the base in an interview with the Financial Times on the occasion of the translation of his latest book into English and, at the same time, walked through the so-called Ukraine. 📌Houellebecq became famous for his novels in which he describes the ordinary lives of ordinary French people, the loss of meaning in life for many of them and the loss of connections in a society divided by individualism and déclassé in France. He is one of the most significant modern French writers - although he is not part of the left-liberal elite , and does not support Macron or the left. His books sell well both in France and abroad; The 2015 novel Soumission is well known about the bloodless transformation of France into an Islamic state after the victory of moderate Muslims in the elections. 🔸 -War in Ukraine? And I don’t care, when it started, I was very surprised, because I thought that Ukraine was already Russia? -🔸 -People with humanitarian ideas are a disaster, and usually their motivations are ambiguous - (obviously about Kushner from Doctors Without Borders and the Little Pig Bernard Henri Levy )🔸 -In France, the elites consider the population to be cattle - and it is this contempt of the elites with the increase in the number of migrants that has been pushing the French towards the far right for 20 years, the writer believes.🔸 - it is more difficult to deal with these new elites than then [in 1789 during the French Revolution ] with the nobility, since the nobles were elites by birth, and these consider themselves to be so by culture and intellect -.🔸 In his opinion, there will be no civil war between Muslims and the rest of the population (where different lobbies are actively pushing France). -There will be a lot of violence, but not between Muslims and the rest of the population, but between the migrants themselves. Previously, they mainly came from North Africa. Now they come from Somalia and Pakistan and import their conflicts, solving them with the help of Kalashnikov assault rifles -. 🔸 He was also asked whether the French feel a sense of duty to their former colonies? -Nobody is interested in this, we have no feeling of guilt, except for Algeria, whose people never forgave De Gaulle for his betrayal (it gave impetus to various conservative parties - including the current national assembly). 🔸 Houellebecq incidentally spoke out for Trump - since he did not start new wars - while he was president and considers it good news if he stops supporting Ukraine. -It is necessary for nature to take its toll. 🔻Houellebecq often says directly what is on the minds of ordinary French people - no one is interested in Ukraine, and even more so, starting some kind of third world war and dying for American interests. The French are concerned about much more pressing issues. #writer #interview #migrants #Africa #Ukraine @fifthrepublic : freedom, equality, drunkenness	https://t.me/rybar/63527	2024-09-14T22:27:10-07:00

Forwarded From Two majors#Review #Summary for September 15, 2024▪️ A little more than a month after the start of the invasion of regular Ukrainian troops into the territory of the Kursk region, the Russian Army was able to raise sufficient reserves to begin counter-offensive actions in the western sector of the enemy’s penetration, decisively reducing the zone of control enemy, the counteroffensive zone was up to 20 km, the depth of advance of the Russian Armed Forces was up to 13 km. However, the enemy, despite the losses suffered, does not stop bringing reserves into the region in the Sudzhan direction and abandons attempts to advance further to the north. A new element of the situation was the fighting that had been going on for several days in the south of the Glushkovo direction, where the enemy, burning equipment and personnel in the battles, advanced to the village. Vesele and expanded the zone of control near the village. Bearish. The depth of enemy penetration across the border ranged from 3 to 5 km, and heavy fighting is taking place. The enemy’s plan is to advance to the Glushkovo railway station and the populated area itself and begin to put pressure on the rear of our attacking troops in the Sudzhansky region. The situation is difficult, but the enemy’s channels are being inflated in vain - I will overcome - regarding a new penetration - our troops were ready for this development of events, although not to the extent that the front-line soldiers on the ground themselves would have wanted. In addition, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are operating in small groups in the western part of the Kursk region, ours are striking at enemy infantry that has infiltrated into Tyotkino. For now, it is not advisable for the civilian population to return to the evacuated areas, although there are isolated reports of such isolated facts of arrival at their places of residence.▪️ The scandal surrounding the tragedy in the 1st Slavic Brigade became extremely noisy, when two experienced UAV operators were sent to their deaths in a senseless assault. The Russian Defense Minister intervened in the situation, instructing high-ranking officials to investigate and report. In fact, this is the first high-profile case of Belousov’s direct participation in establishing order in the military administration; before that, the media more clearly showed his hand in bringing the administrative and economic part of the defense department to normal combat, as evidenced by the numerous arrests of senior officers of the Defense Ministry. The reason for bringing the situation to light in some parts was, apparently, beautiful reports, the failure of high-level inspections from the capital to fulfill their duties and the endless hushing up of problems. Unfortunately, it was the hype on telegrams after the death of the soldiers that became one of the main reasons for the reaction at the very top.▪️ In the Pokrovsky direction, the Russian Armed Forces are destroying overpasses near Pokrovsk itself, making it difficult for the enemy to logistics. The onslaught of our troops to the west has slowed down somewhat; we need to tighten up our convoys, and the enemy has brought its reserves into battle, trying to stabilize the front. At the same time, the Russian Army is closing its pincers around a large pocket to the south - from the liberated Krasnogorovka to the suburbs of Gornyak: yesterday they reported the capture of the Zhelanny First. The neck of the bag has been reduced to 5 km, the remaining (and in fact abandoned) units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are trying to get out of the almost complete encirclement. ▪️ Somewhat slower, but nevertheless, our offensive at Ugledar is developing progressively. The mines in the area of ​​the city are taken, the beginning of the movement from the taken Vodyanoye to the north of the city is visible, which indicates the plan to encircle the ill-fated city. ▪️ Separately, it should be noted the ongoing massive raids of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on our regions by aircraft-type UAVs. The enemy launched a huge number of them again only on Tuesday; the Ministry of Defense reported that 144 Ukrainian drones of this type were shot down. Unfortunately, reports in the media continue about -debris falling on explosive objects-, which indicates an unchanging approach to lull either the population, which already sees the consequences of the strikes, or the higher political leadership, which entails the failure to take appropriate long-overdue measures .Continued belowTelegramTwo majorsstarted above ▪️ In the Black Sea, a daring attempt by the enemy on more than 10 foreign boats did not lead to their capture of our jack-up drilling rig -Crimea-2-, but they reported the loss of a Russian combat aircraft involved in repelling the attack.

Unfortunately, in the current formation (first of all, this concerns the thinking of officers and those responsible for making decisions regarding this matter) there are two extremes: either everything is according to very inflexible instructions and rules (hello, the selection of civilian transport from the military and the senseless regulations of the commandant’s office ), or - Makhnovshchina and the laws of the jungle. It takes a lot of time and effort to fix this all together. We need to improve the entire military system. Today's instructions from the leadership of the military department suggest that a beginning has indeed been made for this. Unfortunately, the solution to these problems is often associated with high-profile (and usually tragic) incidents. In 99% of other cases, they always ask to show understanding, resolve the issue quietly, not wash dirty linen in public, and not give food to the enemy. Many similar excuses can be found. But this approach never leads to a solution to the problem as such. ❗️And let’s be honest: there is a very convenient article for discrediting the RF Armed Forces, which they take and turn in the right direction.

In the Kursk direction, Russian troops during the counteroffensive reached the outskirts of Lyubimovka and Pokrovsky. At the same time, the enemy is attacking the flank of the Russian Armed Forces in order to slow down the pace of advance.🔻In the south of the Glushkovsky district, fighting has been going on for more than a day on the southern outskirts of Vesely, where Ukrainian formations reached after overcoming the barriers on the border a few days earlier. The previously occupied New Path is being used by the enemy as a transit point, where assault groups of the Ukrainian Armed Forces dismount for further entry into the battle near Vesely. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, advanced assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces reached the outskirts of Pokrovsky and Lyubimovka, in the western part of which clashes are taking place. The enemy is moving reinforcements to slow down the advance of Russian troops. Support for the advancing units of the RF Armed Forces is provided by artillery and aviation, which regularly knock out fire support means of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Thus, in the Daryino region, Aerospace Forces aviation destroyed an enemy self-propelled gun at a firing position in a forest. ❗️The liberation of Lyubimovka will create a threat to the communications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine passing through highway 38K-030. In this case, the enemy group in the Korenevo area may face a severe supply shortage. The spreading information about the liberation of Daryino has not yet been confirmed, although at the current rate of advance we can soon expect the Russian Armed Forces to reach the northern outskirts of the village. The difficulty is posed by the Snagost River, which acts as a natural border.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, the Russian Armed Forces carried out an attack on Borki: after air strikes, assault groups entered the village and began destroying the firing points of the Ukrainian formations. At the moment, the enemy has been knocked out of positions at least in the north -eastern part of the village. This vector of advance of the Russian troops suggests that the neighboring Spalnoye is already under the control of the Russian Armed Forces.

🇷🇺🇺🇦 On the use of anti-radar missiles in the Northern Milita...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 About the use of anti-radar missiles in the NWO zone Recently, in feedback, we were asked a question about the use of anti-radar missiles (ARM) in the NWO zone, which arose due to a decrease in the frequency of their mention in news reports. Because of this, one could get the impression that they had stopped using them completely. In reality, there is no talk of abandoning the PRR - on the Internet you can still periodically find reports of Kh-31P launches against Ukrainian air defense systems or the interception of American AGM-88 HARM by air defense systems . Although there are nuances here: ▪️If you don’t go into some technical aspects, then neither the X-28/31P nor other types of PRR are prodigies that easily capture the necessary radiation and unmistakably follow the object. In this case, the principle of one launch - one hit is far from the principle.▪️The enemy also takes measures to maintain secrecy - he reduces the operating time of the radar stations of his air defense systems and changes positions. As a result, even for aircraft on duty in the air with PRR, it is not so easy to destroy enemy radars by launching the X-31P.▪️On the other side of the front, the situation is even worse - the installation of American AGM-88s on -non-standard- carriers in the form of Ukrainian MiG-29s led to restrictions on their application. This is also why they often fly around Donetsk or even cities occupied by the Kyiv regime. From the point of view of the effectiveness of using PRR, the picture is also different: if the RF Armed Forces have a certain number of damaged X-28/31P radars, then the Armed Forces of Ukraine have such episodes less than the fingers on your hand. At the same time, the enemy has not yet launched HARM en masse from the more standard F-16s. The development of anti-radar missiles in the future may follow the path of complicating homing heads and computing devices to expand their technical capabilities. As well as integration with target designation systems up to space ones.#Russia #weapons #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63521	2024-09-14T09:31:13-07:00

The trilateral training, which included the United States, Italy and Australia, took place over four days. Washington sent the destroyer USS Russel, Milan sent the aircraft carrier ITS Cavour, the patrol ship ITS Raimondo Montecuccoli and the frigate ITS Alpino, and Canberra sent the P-8A Poseidon patrol aircraft. 🔻The maneuvers focused on combined anti-submarine defense and development of interaction skills in the field of command and control. The main goals of the exercises were to strengthen cooperation between the three countries, reaffirm the US commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific region, and demonstrate its intentions to its allies. Considering that almost every time China sends ships and aircraft there in response to major exercises in the South China Sea, these exercises may not be an exception. Therefore, we should soon expect one reaction or another from the Chinese military.

Combined air-ground operations were suspended, which was taken advantage of by anti-government groups who carried out several attacks throughout the country. However, the largest attack was directed against civilians. Near the city of Barsalo, the armed forces attracted local residents to build a security perimeter - such a fortification system had already been built in the north and west, all that remained was to complete the eastern borders. Several militiamen from the -Volunteers for the Salvation of the Motherland- were assigned to guard the 300 workers. While working, they were attacked by about a hundred militants of the al-Qaeda-affiliated group Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimeen (JNIM), who killed more than two hundred peasants. This incident raised serious concerns about security in the area. Unfortunately, the situation in the country is really deteriorating, even if it is not as terrible as the Western media portray, which are already speculating almost on the topic of the possible fall of the capital Ouagadougou. A notable event on the foreign policy circuit was the non-participation of the country's President Ibrahim Traore in the Chinese-African forum - a similar decision was previously made by his Malian counterpart Assimi Goita. Instead, negotiations were held with neighbors from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The parties announced joint efforts to combat terrorism, which is especially important against the backdrop of JNIM attacks in previously uncharacteristic areas in northern Benin and Togo. In general, recent events in Burkina Faso are not in favor of government troops. At the same time, in the medium term the situation may change - the Afrika Korps is in the process of deployment and is only preparing new forces, and the government is relatively successful in recruiting volunteers.

The topic has long been discussed in British media, and it was especially actively discussed in light of the visit to Kyiv of the heads of the British Foreign Ministry and the American State Department. However, as a result of the meeting, politicians did not make any competitive statements on this matter. Therefore, it is worth dwelling on several aspects.▪️Firstly, the absence of an official announcement about the lifting of the ban does not mean that London and Washington did not give it the green light. It cannot be ruled out that the decision will be announced along with the first strike for greater media effect.▪️ At the same time, it cannot be ruled out that the collective West is currently satisfied with the current state of affairs at the front. As we mentioned earlier, the Anglo-Saxons are following the path of gradually increasing the level of escalation, largely for reasons of political necessity. With the deterioration of the position of the Kyiv regime, the situation can change very quickly - it won’t take much time to give a command. Moreover, the USA and Britain themselves do not risk anything, almost officially using the so-called. Ukraine to do the dirty work in its own interests. Of course, I would like to believe that the Russian leadership found some arguments that forced NATO to postpone the corresponding decision or even change its mind about making it. In any case, time will tell.#Russia #Ukraine #UK #USA @rybar together with @oldGBRSupport usthe GuardianJoe Biden dismisses Russian threats during meeting with Keir StarmerUS and UK leaders’ talks dominated by row with Russia over use of Storm Shadow missiles	https://t.me/rybar/63518	2024-09-14T06:25:05-07:00

At the same time, in the areas bordering Algeria there has been an increase in military presence, which Western analysts associate with the preparation of a revenge plan for the ambush near the town of Tin-Zautin. ▪️Air operations continue: a so-called separatist pickup truck was destroyed in the north. Azawad. In addition, troops combed the urban area, identifying weapons from residents of the city of Kidal, a former stronghold of the separatists. In addition, further south - the death road - from Douenza to Gossi, where there were recent ambushes on government forces, vehicles of radical Islamists affiliated with Al -Qaeda faction JNIM. Also in the Mopti region, the armed forces carried out an operation to free livestock stolen by militants in Bankass district. And to strengthen security in these areas, new prefects with experience as officers were appointed.▪️Meanwhile, the militants, despite the weather conditions, did not stop their attacks. The so-called separatists distinguished themselves in this. Azawad, who attacked the base in Gundam, Timbuktu region, using a quadcopter with a drop. Material damage from the attack was minimal, and the attackers called it a warning. In turn, militants associated with al-Qaeda attacked Malian army convoys west of the city of Gao, and also near the border with Mauritania - near the city of Nampala.🔻On In the political field, an important event was the trip of the transitional President of Mali, Assimi Goita, to Beijing for the forum on Chinese-African cooperation. In addition to meetings with African leaders, he concluded agreements on the supply of new equipment from the Norinco company. Interesting projects are also planned in relations with Russia - an intergovernmental commission is scheduled to start work in early October, the task of which will be to overcome bureaucratic barriers and support business projects between countries.

🔁 Yesterday, some commentators wrote with obvious surprise about...	Forwarded From Andrei Medvedev Yesterday, some commentators wrote with obvious surprise about another scandal involving British spies who, as it were, were still diplomats. -How can that be, but this is a violation of all principles of international relations-. However, in the case of the British, the case may be considered more surprising if suddenly, for some reason, the diplomat is not also an employee of the intelligence services. This has always been the case in Britain. There is often no difference between a spy and a diplomat/traveler/culturologist/journalist. One of the most famous orientalists in Britain is Arminius Vambery. He worked in the 19th century, lived in Istanbul, taught history and English to the children of the local elite, and traveled to Central Asia. in 2005, London admitted that Vambery was a spy (by the way, he was also the prototype of Van Helsing). Daniel Defoe, Alan Milne (yup, Winnie the Pooh), Somerset Maugham, Graham Greene, John Le Carré, and probably Kipling worked for intelligence. For the English, his main work is not -The Jungle Book,- but -Kim- and war poems. And judging by the content of Kim, the author was very well acquainted with the activities of the pandits and the working methods of the Indian Service and the Scout Corps. The two intelligence officers who were the first Europeans to cross Afghanistan from east to west - Charles Christie and Henry Pottinger - disguised as Tatar merchants are an example of how British diplomacy worked even then. Christie became a PMC instructor and military adviser and trained the Ukrainian Persian army in the war against Russia; he was killed as a Marine of the 810th brigade by a Russian Cossack in 2024 in the battle of Malaya Lokni in 1812, in the battle of Aslanduz. And Pottinger just became a diplomat, knight and governor of Hong Kong. All British diplomacy of the 18th and 19th centuries consisted entirely of diplomats with officer ranks, officers in the role of ambassadors (Arthur Connolly, the author of the term -Great Game-, is the clearest example of this), and all together intelligence officers. And then the tradition flowed into the 20th and 21st centuries. This is normal for an island empire, where expansion and diplomatic intrigue were the key to the survival of the state. The skill to play one against another and remain on good terms with everyone. And after all, the East India Company was the driver of diplomacy, intelligence and economic development for almost two centuries. The corporate state long predates the age of globalization. Without the Company, Britain would never have become an empire. And precisely in the Company the concept of -ambassador- was very vague. The British ambassador is not about maintaining etiquette or international relations. Only and exclusively about obtaining benefits for the Company and the Empire, and by any means. Anything at all. Here's an example for you. China and the Opium Wars. It's a long story to tell. But just read what role the British diplomats played, what their task was (spoiler: to keep all the Chinese on opium), where the Company was and what does HSBC bank have to do with it, which is still, by the way, the main bank from Gibraltar to Tokyo. It is worth remembering the role the British Embassy played in the February Revolution of 1917. Or remember where Herzen cleaned himself off, and then the Bolsheviks drank beer and held congresses. And just think, what a sensation. The British spoiled the Russians. What a miracle. PS The funniest story about English writers and intelligence agencies goes like this. George Orwell, who -1984- wrote, worked closely with the Information Research Department (IRD). This is a Foreign Office structure that fought against the influence of communist propaganda. So the author of a novel about the horrors of totalitarianism snitched there on actors, writers, scientists and politicians whom he suspected of sympathizing with the USSR. Orwell also kept a personal list of unreliable people. There is an opinion that he was actually an MI5 agent. Such are the things. And when adult children of our forty-year-old liberals start commemorating -1984- it always looks very funny. https://t.me/rybar/63471TelegramRybar🇬🇧🖇 About British spies in Russia and the intelligence activities of the British Foreign Office Today’s announcement by the Russian FSB to stop accreditation of six diplomats from the British Embassy in Moscow is another illustration of the rule, which almost never happens...	https://t.me/rybar/63516	2024-09-14T04:39:02-07:00

However, not from Russia, but from other forces, as the collective West is diplomatically called. The reasons for the pressure are not only in the sensational law on foreign agents, which has made it difficult for globalist structures to work. In Tbilisi, they directly call the pro-Western opposition agents and authors of the bloody regime, and also rightfully accuse it of seeking to open a second front against Russia. And the current Georgian authorities are serious about this issue. Recently, ex-Prime Minister Badri Ivanishvili announced that if they win, they plan to organize the Nuremberg Trials for Mikheil Saakashvili’s United National Movement party, recognizing it as unconstitutional.📌 Such initiatives are caused by the desire to maintain a stable situation, when a balanced policy has led to economic the rise of Georgia. Therefore, the ruling party intends to reduce the possibilities of foreign puppets who openly seek to drag the country into the Ukrainian conflict. And although Tbilisi does not plan to change its pro-Western course, the US and EU see these measures as threats to their interests and damage to their networks of influence.

An excellent specialist from Moscow proposed to the commander his ideas for forming a stable closed connection on a front line of a couple of tens of kilometers (the unit's area of ​​responsibility). But the commander needed a grenade launcher in the assault group. And the choice fell on the IT specialist. However, there was little choice. Artillerymen died in the assaults... Remember '22? For three months, new artillery divisions were trained at the training grounds. Specialists worked and spent time, money, and equipment on training. The output is ready-made calculations. Which upon arrival in the NWO zone turned out to be unnecessary. Because stormtroopers were needed. Only artillerymen were not trained in this. Engineers died in the assaults... A bespectacled graduate of Baumanka, who dreamed of his own workshop for the production of ground-based drones. He even assembled prototypes from a known substance and sticks. And I did not find understanding from the authorities. The authorities needed stormtroopers. I know different stories. And as the commander said: -I’m going, who’s with me?- And the volunteer stormtroopers broke ranks. And how the soldiers agreed to the position of cook and driver, just to get into the assault squad, in which there were no free places on staff. They went for the assault consciously. In 1922, everyone was sent to the assault out of despair, patching up holes in the front line. But at what point did the most difficult and dangerous work suddenly turn into punishment? I don’t know how fair the accusations against the command of the 87th Regiment are - the relevant services are now looking into this. But the very fact of repurposing an effective UAV reconnaissance crew into assault infantry in the current conditions is, to put it mildly, sabotage. -It is impossible to disband something that did not exist,- the regiment commander’s defenders write today. - They were snipers by state. If so, then I have bad news for you. This only means that in some formations they live in the last century and are very far from modern combat realities, if the regiment’s staff does not at least provide for a UAV department. And aerial reconnaissance is carried out by snipers, who have probably never even held a Dragunov rifle in their hands. But they were unmanned, without which it is simply impossible to fight today. @sashakots	https://t.me/rybar/63512	2024-09-14T02:37:54-07:00

First, after several months of empty talk, the European Union announced that they had begun negotiations on weakening the visa regime for Armenians (about the nuances we have already talked about this -bonus). And a couple of days ago, the head of the USAID office in Yerevan, John Allelo, in the presence of Deputy Prime Minister Mher Grigoryan, announced an increase in funding for Armenia from $120 million to $250. The money will go to various areas, including disaster risk management , cybersecurity, food and energy security, regional cooperation and trade.📌 An increase in funding of this amount looks more impressive when compared to the summer handouts. One of the areas to which resources will be directed is the economic sustainability of Armenia. However, one must understand that this is funding for a year, and not a one-time payment for the needs of Armenians. Looking at the impressive list of tasks that USAID intends to cover with this money, you understand that only a fraction of the total amount will be spent on each of the areas.

🇨🇳🇲🇾 On the prospects of a united front against China in the ...	🇨🇳🇲🇾 On the prospects of a united front against China in the South China Sea At the recent Eastern Economic Forum, one of the main guests was Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. In general, his statements at this event were more related to cooperation with Russia and other related topics. However, they did not avoid mentioning the problem of the South China Sea. In one of his interviews, the Malaysian prime minister said that Kuala Lumpur will not submit to pressure from the PRC. This is how he commented on the recent leak of diplomatic documents, in one of which the Chinese side demanded that Malaysia stop extracting resources from the disputed waters of the South China Sea. ▪️Anwar Ibrahim's statements received a lot of attention in the media. Because of this, some might think that there might be difficulties in Sino-Malaysian relations. Such observers are based on fantasies about a united front against China in the South China Sea. We said earlier that the possibility of its creation is unlikely, at least in the near future. It will include only the Philippines for a long time, since of the countries participating in the dispute, only Manila speaks openly anti-Chinese.🔻The current Malaysian leadership’s approach to the issue of disputed territories is partly similar to the Vietnamese one. This problem does not define the relationship between Kuala Lumpur and Beijing, but at the same time, Malaysia continues to insist on its claims and extract resources in the waters. That is why neither Vietnam nor Malaysia will soon join the Philippines’ active policy of asserting rights to the water area. This generally complicates Manila’s position in ASEAN, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which includes all three countries. They do not share such an anti-Chinese position, so the Philippines will continue to rely only on the help of extra-regional players, including the United States, Japan and Australia. Fortunately, their interest in the South China Sea will remain for a long time - they need to restrain China somehow. #China #Malaysia@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usTelegramWoke dragon 🐲🇲🇾🇨🇳 As many know, he is present at the Eastern Economic Forum , in addition to Vladimir Putin and Chinese Deputy Chairman Han Zhen, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.

The bombings killed dozens of people, and some medical facilities stopped working due to lack of medicine. ▪️And in Beit Lahia, amid reports in the Israeli media about the impending IDF offensive, the evacuation of the population began. The information has never been officially confirmed, but due to the continued launches of Hamas rockets from the city, it is a matter of time. ▪️Meanwhile, in the southeast of Gaza, fighting continued near the University College building in the Tell al-Hawa area. IDF units carried out several bombings of buildings, and Hamas militants responded with a series of ambushes. ▪️In the central part of the enclave, Israeli troops carried out traditional attacks on Hamas-controlled settlements. Al-Brej and Nuseirat came under the most intense fire, where over thirty people were killed.▪️At the same time, one of the strikes on Nuseirat hit a school, resulting in the death of six UNRWA employees at once. At the same time, the Israeli Defense Forces routinely announced that they had hit the positions of Palestinian forces.▪️Israeli units also continue to carry out engineering work in the Netzarim corridor. There, the terrain is being leveled and defensive structures are being built.▪️In the south of the Gaza Strip, Israeli troops once again worked in the humanitarian zone. The most high-profile attack was a raid on a tent camp in Al-Mawasi, where at least 40 refugees were killed and over 60 people were injured. ▪️In Rafah, the Israelis focused their efforts on creating a buffer zone and destroying Hamas infrastructure. Nevertheless, the Palestinian formations have not yet lost their combat capability and carry out incursions relatively regularly.#video #digest #map #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/63508	2024-09-13T23:00:38-07:00

The Ukrainian Armed Forces launched drones in the direction of the Bryansk, Oryol, Kaluga and Smolensk regions, all targets were shot down. In the Kursk region, fighting continues in the Korenevsky and Sudzhansky districts. The Ukrainian Armed Forces carried out an attack in the Glushkovsky district, the outcome of which is still unknown. In the Pokrovsky direction, fighting is taking place on the eastern outskirts of Selidovo, as well as in the area of ​​Ukrainsk to the south and Novogrodovka to the north.

🔁 There will be abuses by commanders until there is strict accou...	Forwarded From Unofficial Bezsonov Abuse by commanders will continue until there is strict liability for personnel losses. Unfortunately, there are quite a few such cases in different departments. Remember the commander of our naval special forces group -Komandant-? His group of 6 people unraveled Ukrainian special forces of 40 people on February 28 on the Tendrovskaya spit, Kherson region. Due to a conflict with the command and the fact that it was decided to reward other people for this battle, the coherent and effective group - the Commandant - was divided into assault units. For what? Think for yourself. In Donetsk, an effective group of hackers, which had worked for many years for the benefit of our army and obtained secret enemy information, was also sent into assaults due to the biased attitude (to put it mildly) of the command. In the second half of August, one of them died in the Avdeevsky direction. We probably have too many IT specialists in our country, and especially hackers. Everyone knows all this. And not only in the army, but also in civilian life. This not only undermines the combat readiness of the troops, but also influences the decision of potential volunteers to sign a contract. It is criminal to remain silent about this. The situation has become a trend.TelegramRybar🇷🇺🪖 About -spanking- transfer to assault.

🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦 Kursk direction: attack of the Ukrainian Armed Forces...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 Kursk direction: attack of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Veseloye and destruction of armored vehicles of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk region, the situation towards the end September 13, 2024 While Russian troops in the Kursk direction are advancing towards Lyubimovka, Ukrainian formations launched an attack on the right flank of the defense of the Russian Armed Forces. 🔻In the Glushkovsky district, Ukrainian formations occupied several buildings in the south of the village of Tetkino. Most likely, these positions have been under the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces for a long time, however, it became possible to determine the current front line in the area only with the publication of objective control footage. ▪️To the east, the enemy, taking advantage of the diversion of a significant part of the forces to the counter-offensive operation of the Russian Armed Forces at the Snagost-Viktorovka line, attacked Russian positions south of Glushkovo. Ukrainian formations were able to push the Russian Armed Forces back from the village of Novy Put and are now attacking Vesyoloye located to the north. According to available information, the enemy is using engineering equipment to make passages in the minefields on the southern approaches to the village. Units of the Russian Armed Forces, with the support of border troops, are trying to prevent the enemy from reaching highway 38N-052 leading to Glushkovo. ❗️The intention of the Ukrainian Armed Forces command is likely to be a quick dash to the village in order to cut off one of the key supply roads for Russian troops in the Glushkovsky district. Nevertheless, the enemy’s advanced groups are already involved in heavy fighting on the approaches to Vesyoly, which neutralizes the effect of surprise and gives the Russian Armed Forces time to transfer reserves. 🔻Frames of a destroyed convoy of Ukrainian Armed Forces equipment in the Korenevsky district, filmed northwest of the recently liberated Apanasovka, have appeared on the Internet. The road passing here became a cemetery for armored vehicles and armored vehicles of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, burned by Russian UAV operators both before and during the counter-offensive of the Russian Armed Forces in the Glushkovsky district. ▪️To the northwest of Novoivanovka, Russian operators destroyed a T-72 tank of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, using a loitering munition -Lancet- and an attack drone -Forpost-. The combat vehicle was discovered while parked in one of the forest belts; the target was monitored using a reconnaissance drone. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, apparently, Cherkasy Porechnoye has completely come under enemy control. It was possible to confirm the presence of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the northern outskirts of the village, which were previously in the gray zone, thanks to footage of the combat work of Russian artillery published on the Internet. It is likely that Russian units took up more advantageous defensive positions to the northeast, in the Berdin area. 🔻In the Sumy region, the Russian Aerospace Forces hit enemy military facilities in Yampol. During the strike, several members of the volunteer organization RAZOM, which raises funds for the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, were injured.

This time, special forces units - Boundless Brotherhood-III - at the Orda training ground in the Turkestan region. Up to 300 special forces and several dozen military equipment from Kazakhstan, Turkey, Pakistan, Qatar, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, as well as Jordan and Kyrgyzstan are taking part in it. observers.❗️Since July this year, this is already the fifth exercise on the territory of Kazakhstan and the third with the participation of some members -Organizations of Turkic states-. There was also a training session with Belarusians and a separate event -Aibalta-. We notice an increasingly clear trend towards rapprochement between Kazakhstan and the Turkic states, not only in the economic and cultural spheres, but also through security forces and the armed forces. The exchange of military experience has become more frequent - Azerbaijanis and Turks actively contribute. And a few days ago, a meeting of the ministers of internal affairs of the UTG countries took place.📌 The fact that the Turks (or rather those who stand behind them) are striving to expand the powers of the UTG is no longer a secret. The organization can be called the brainchild of Britain, which uses Turkey to promote its interests. An agreement was reached to unify the alphabet, and after that they will try to do the same with the language, which accordingly in the future will weaken Russia’s position in the post-Soviet space. And military interaction will further strengthen the position of the bloc, which still positions itself as political. At the same time, the Turks are already selling their drones and armored vehicles in Central Asia, occupying a niche that used to be Russian. The militarization of the UTG is proceeding by leaps and bounds. Yesterday, for example, Turkish Defense Minister Yashar Güler held a meeting with his Kazakh counterpart, and the day before yesterday with President Tokayev regarding deepening defense cooperation. While all the efforts of our state are occupied in the northwestern defense, the enemy is not asleep and is strengthening its positions at our side, interacting more and more with a member of the CSTO.

A certain German research agency broadcasting in Russian has revealed a shocking trend: radicals are increasingly recruiting teenagers and young people in Europe .Between March 2023 and March 2024, 470 cases related to IS were registered, of which at least 30 concerned young people and teenagers.📌 How quickly they reset their memory in the West! Researchers forgot one important thing - IS militants have always recruited children and youth into their ranks. During the active phase in Iraq and Syria, children trained by radicals were one of the most serious threats posed by IS. -The Lion Cubs of the Caliphate- thundered throughout the world. And how many children suffered physically and psychologically after the end of the war with the group? They can be counted for a very, very long time. The fact that ISIS preachers choose this particular category of people is not surprising. This is a standard tactic of any extremist organization due to their flexibility and ability to learn what is required. Therefore, the Germans did not say anything new. But they created some kind of excitement on the Internet, and this is what is required as part of the artificial revival of an international terrorist group.#Germany #terrorism@rybarSupport usAussiedlerboteIslamic terrorism in Germany is getting youngerIslamic terrorism in Germany is getting younger.

Unfortunately, in parts of the Russian army, since the appearance of the Storm units, a disastrous practice has appeared: instead of glorifying the feat of stormtroopers, who reconquer territories on their shoulders and with their lives, from them - in some units - they turn them into convicts and people who -will die anyway-. This means that they must be treated according to the residual principle. As a repressive instrument, this works exclusively to the detriment: rogue commanders remain in power, and truth-telling soldiers and officers die. Of course, based on the results of military operations, they can present a departmental or state award, but who needs it? This leads to a more terrible problem: why don’t people go to the front. Because people are afraid to find themselves in a unit where the Storm squad is a meat grinder and the destruction of truth-tellers. And it doesn’t matter that this concerns only a small part of the units. -Soldiers' radio, retelling such cases, works in such a way that it reaches not only those who are hesitant to come to the front in Moscow, but also in Kamchatka and Sakhalin. Literally today with Danya Bezsonov @NeoficialniyBeZsonoV we discussed that this is a problem that needs to be brought up for the next meeting of military correspondents and military bloggers with the Minister of Defense. ❓But there are certain doubts: how will they begin to approve after this - the procedure for transferring a serviceman to an assault unit -, - instructions for recruiting units - Storm - and - a methodological manual for attracting personnel to attack aircraft -?

They seem to show a parallel reality: crews in blue overalls and leather jackets, launching unguided missiles from a height of a hundred meters. It’s as if in another part of the country there are no military operations taking place against an enemy with hundreds of MANPADS, where such flights in the zone of enemy air defense are fraught with disastrous outcomes. This example is far from isolated - we received feedback from several similar stories from different areas. In general, they boil down to the fact that some military leaders think in the paradigm not even of the time of the Syrian operation, but of the Second World War or even its artistic interpretations.📌 The problems of comprehending experience explain many of the sad moments of the last 40 years. If the same USA, as Prince Cherkassky noted, studied the conflict in Chechnya and published applied monographs, we still have an extremely simplified view of those events, where the reasons for failures on the battlefield are reduced to politics, and all military aspects are simply taken out of the equation The consequences of this approach could be seen in the footage of 2022 with those on fire and those lost.

This will be the last meeting in this composition - American President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race, and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is not elected to the post of leader of the ruling party in the country. According to Japanese media, the summit will take place on September 21 during the regular session of the UN General Assembly in the United States. However, the meeting will not take place on the sidelines of the UN. It will take the form of a separate event in order to fully discuss the entire agenda of the quadripartite bloc. 🔻QUAD generally positions itself as an organization whose activities are not aimed purely at countering China. Within the bloc, the main focus is on cooperation in the humanitarian and technological spheres. However, recently the participating countries have been increasing ties in other areas, including military. A good example is the annual exercise -Malabar-, in which previously only military personnel from India and the United States participated - now representatives of Japan and Australia are permanent participants. ▪️For example, statements by the Australian Minister of Foreign Affairs speak towards the anti-Chinese orientation of QUAD. She emphasized that the Quartet seeks to prevent the dominance of any power in the region, hinting at the PRC. Against the background of the shift of the main point of tension in the region from the Indian-Chinese border to the South China Sea, we can say that QUAD has disappeared from the radar. A possible summit could return the bloc to the field of active discussion, emphasizing that no one has forgotten about this organization. Considering how bilateral and multilateral alliances are being created (or modernized) in the region under the auspices of the United States, a new security architecture aimed at containing the PRC is gradually being formalized in the Asia-Pacific region. And QUAD, even despite possible internal contradictions and connections to the confrontation with Beijing, the Philippines continues to remain its main part. #Australia #India #USA #Japan @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63490	2024-09-13T07:04:10-07:00

The previous similar process occurred on August 24, when 115 soldiers of the Russian Armed Forces returned to Russia. According to individual sources, the number of released Russian soldiers also included those who fought in the Kursk direction. Officials from the Russian Federation have not yet commented on the fact of today's exchange. Some sources report that this is only the first stage of a more global process of mutual transfer of prisoners of war between the parties. 49 soldiers returned to Russia, all of them are receiving the necessary assistance.

It was on this section of the front that the Russian Armed Forces first used armored vehicles, modified with protection against drones and cumulative shells, popularly nicknamed the Tsar Tanks.▪️Over the past month, only the northwestern outskirts of Krasnogorovka remained under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. After the liberation of the private sector located on the right bank of the Lozovaya River, the Russian Armed Forces drove the enemy out of the territory of the farm complex located to the west. In the area of ​​the Lenin Kolkhoz microdistrict, attack aircraft in small groups, supported by unmanned aircraft, cleared positions occupied by members of Ukrainian formations. At the same time, the fighters managed to evacuate several civilians who had previously refused to move deeper into the so-called. Ukraine.▪️The complete liberation of Krasnohorivka and the cleansing of the western outskirts was marked at the end of last week by the hoisting of the flag and advance in the fields to the north. ▪️The night before it became known that the Russian Armed Forces carried out a large-scale offensive in the fields between Krasnogorovka and Georgievka, eliminating the pocket between the Lozovaya River and the Sukhaya gully. A column of several dozen units of armored vehicles of the RF Armed Forces advanced from the Lisya gully and passed southwest in the direction of Ostroy . Having crossed the railway track, the Russian landing force gained a foothold on the eastern outskirts of the village: at the moment, about a third of the village’s territory is under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. Fighting is taking place on the approaches to school No. 24 and the Ostry railway station.❗️Despite the fact that the enemy claimed to have allegedly repelled the assault and suffered significant losses of the Russian Armed Forces, the footage he published refute this information. Almost all the equipment reached their destination and landed troops among a relatively intact settlement. The capture of Ostroy will speed up the liberation of the long-suffering Maksimilyanivka, as well as attack Alexandropol from the north in the direction of the Zoryanoye - Gornyak line, with the aim of closing the lid of the boiler, more than 10 kilometers deep in the fields near Nevelskoy. In addition, the liquidation of a large enemy fortified area in Kurakhovo moves the front line away from the DPR and significantly reduces the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ ability to launch artillery strikes on Russian populated areas.

Frida @sex_drugs_kahlo spoke about entertaining publications in the American press, which refer to videos on TikTok and talk about attacks by Venezuelan gangs to fields in West Texas. The local police, according to an already established tradition, are not doing anything about this, but Elon Musk himself has taken on PR for the rampant Venezuelan gang in Texas. The authors of Econopocalypse @econopocalypse explained in detail what consequences stories about the growth of criminal activity (which may well be) could entail staged) in American oil fields. In particular, they talked about the difficult situation in the American oil sector, as well as the fact that such attacks provoke a decline in prices for the assets of companies in the Permian Basin. Businesses suffer material damage, which makes it possible to demand compensation from insurance companies - this will allow them to sell unprofitable assets at significantly lower prices in the future without losing face. As a result, large US oil and gas companies expect to sell or exchange unprofitable assets to structures affiliated with the US government. In any case, the Permian Basin will remain one of the main sources of oil for the American economy. If the influence of US government agencies extends to local assets, then this will make it possible to declare a conditional replenishment of the US strategic oil reserve, which is now at its lowest level in the last 40 years. ❗️This argument can be used by Democrats to influence the position of voters in the upcoming presidential election.

🔁 🇬🇧🇵🇱 How interesting events have been developing since the...	Forwarded From Warsaw Mermaid🇬🇧🇵🇱 How interesting events have been developing since the very morning: the world learned about the next British machinations related to the escalation of the international military-political situation. The FSB stated that the documents they received confirm the activities of a separate structure coordinating subversive policies in the Russian direction and in the CIS. And all this is directly subordinate to the British Foreign Office. In this regard, six employees of the political department of the British Embassy in Moscow were immediately expelled from Moscow, and the FSB is also going to demand the early termination of the work of British diplomats in Russia. True, only if signs of reconnaissance and subversive activities are identified in their work. Most likely, they will simply begin to encrypt better. 🔻I assume that one of the declared partners of this initiative was the Poles. It is painfully active, especially recently, not just anti-Russian sentiments have been manifested there, but aggressive attacks bordering on a declaration of war. The Directorate for Eastern Europe and Central Asia (EECAD), in fact, is a gigantic British propaganda machine, which includes not only lobbying, control and financing of a mass of strategic resources, but also direct management of them. Regardless of the country in which this resource is located.🔻And just a few years ago, Great Britain and Poland created a new joint unit to -counter Russian disinformation- and, under its auspices, conduct annual consultations on -Moscow's hostile activities-. The then British Prime Minister Theresa May noted that all this was for the sake of -protecting democracy- and concerns about -Russia's attempts to undermine the international rules-based system-.📌To doubt the loyalty of the Polish authorities (whoever they were then and now) to the British, fortunately for them, they don’t have to. At the same time, considering how long it will take to work in this field, it is obvious that many structures in Poland, for example, have long been ready for active action and are just waiting for the go-ahead to implement the next intervention or escalation of the international conflict. Therefore, the FSB, perhaps, should pay attention not only to the employees of the British embassy. #Poland #Great Britain@pl_syrenka - Poland is not abroadTelegramRybar🇬🇧🖇 About British spies in Russia and the intelligence activities of the British Foreign Office Today's statement by the Russian FSB to stop accreditation of six diplomats from the British Embassy in Moscow is another illustration of the rule, which almost never happens...	https://t.me/rybar/63484	2024-09-13T03:15:37-07:00

Six British diplomats will leave Russia on charges of espionage and subversion. According to the published materials with the stamp, MI6 now has an entire directorate responsible for operations in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and part of the foreign policy department has been transformed into a full-fledged structure of the intelligence services of Foggy Albion. In addition, the Foreign Office has opened a Directorate of Information Threats and influence (Information Threats and Influence Directorate). One of the programs is related to the fight against disinformation and media development. Is it worth explaining that this struggle extends not only to the CIS? From documents of the British network of influence agents Integrity Initiative, which leaked to the Internet in 2019, we learned about the formation of a network of loyal media in the Balkans. Over time, they were supposed to act as silencers for Kremlin propaganda. According to information about the so-called Serbian cluster, in the fight against Russian influence, British intelligence, for example, had high hopes for the Center for Euro-Atlantic Studies (CEAS). In parallel, the global distribution network of United Media was formed in the region with financial resources from British investors. Remember how I told you that most of the deals to acquire shares in local media were unprofitable for investors? But they were carried out under the strict guidance of Western intelligence services and pursued a completely different goal - to gain control over the information space of the Balkans. And just recently, correspondence from BIRN network employees was published, indicating that London’s participation in the project goes far beyond simply funding the portal. Among the donors there are many scam companies working with British intelligence, and the organization’s employees are trained by seasoned intelligence officers through the structures of the British Council. In fact, as part of the Foreign Office project, MI6 curators took control of the Balkan media. @balkanossiper - we have been setting world trends since June 28, 1914	https://t.me/rybar/63483	2024-09-13T02:25:14-07:00

However, only after the threat of another mass protest did the government decide to meet the protesters halfway and announced the preparation of a document on the introduction of a state of emergency in the area. 🔻Obviously, years later, the government suddenly decided to make concessions to farmers only because presidential elections and a referendum on joining the EU would take place in a month and a half. In such a situation, the current government certainly does not need hundreds of tractors that block the country’s main highways and block government buildings in Chisinau. Previously, the Moldovan authorities simply ignored the problems of farmers, supporting the Western trend of destroying national agricultural farms in favor of global corporations such as Blackrock. So there is not a single reason why, after the re-election of Maia Sandu, the country’s authorities will not return to the old policy of destroying the agricultural sector. #Moldova #protests@rybarSupport usRUPORFarmers in the south of Moldova go out to protestFarmers from the Cahul and Cantemir regions announced the start of protests.

Forwarded From Old Lady England🇬🇧🇷🇺Rybar writes about the presence of a special department within the British Foreign Office that specializes in countering Russia. The purpose of the organization's functioning is to cause maximum damage and strategic defeat to our country. When studying the structure of the department, we discovered that as a result of reforms, part of the organization was merged with the Directorate of Defense and International Security, whose main task is&nbsp; coordination of the Ministry of Defense and Foreign Affairs on national security issues. As a result of the merger, a division was formed whose area of ​​responsibility includes Russia and Ukraine. Such a structure is the Ukraine Campaign Unit, which is responsible for coordinating various aspects of the Foreign Ministry’s activities in the context of the armed conflict in Ukraine. In general, since November 2022, the British have already reformed the units responsible for foreign policy several times in order to improve their efficiency. Such frequent changes indicate that the British are constantly trying to adapt to new conditions, and this approach ultimately produces results.

The IDF said most of the missiles were intercepted, while others fell in open areas.

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇬🇧🇷🇺 Early in the morning it became known that six employees of the political department of the British Embassy in Moscow were expelled from Moscow - signs of intelligence and subversive work were found in their actions. And all this is connected with the fact that London is coordinating the escalation of the international military-political situation. As colleagues say, the main structure coordinating subversive policies in the Russian direction and in the CIS is the Eastern Europe and Central Asia Directorate, EECAD ). The central persons of this system are British Deputy Foreign Secretary Philip Barton, National Security Adviser to the Prime Minister Tim Barrow, Deputy Head of the Russia Policy Department Christopher Joyce, heads of HMG Russia Unit James Beer and Mark Diamond. And under the leadership of EECAD there is also Another rather interesting department is the Information Threats and Influence Directorate (ITID). In fact, this department is a kind of propaganda ministry, whose tasks include, among other things, continuing to wage a hybrid war with Russia.🔻The documents indicate that the catalyst for the creation of ITID was precisely the Russian special operation in Ukraine and with the help of this crisis its employees are studying how everything key state actors use manipulation and intervention to cause damage, and develop countermeasures.🔻The head of ITID is Johnny Hall, who was previously the Prime Minister's Private Secretary for Foreign Affairs. Hall is working on -innovative approaches- to maintain reliable information so that -it can be reliably delivered to citizens. In other words: he is developing mechanisms that will allow British services to transmit for distribution only the information that is needed, and not provide access only to truthful data. He spoke about this more than once, especially emphasizing this at one of the annual Stratcom forums in Kyiv. Hall then added that for this work, the UK is attracting -partners-, collaborating with colleagues from UK ministries and departments, as well as with the military, in order to cover the entire sector of public administration. In his opinion, Ukraine is an example of cross-cutting government and public work, when it was possible form teams of people who counter Russian disinformation.🔻In addition, the ITID structure includes at least one more interesting character - the head of the threat mitigation unit, Andy Price. Price is an expert in propaganda and manipulation of the public through media. He was exposed as a key player in the controversial MI6 project known as the Integrity Initiative. The goal of the project was to interfere in the internal affairs of European countries and to unleash an information war against the Russian Federation. It was founded in 2015 and was fully funded by the British government. Also associated with the project are financier William Browder, Vladimir Ashurkov, an associate of Alexei Navalny, and scientist Igor Sutyagin, convicted in 2004 of espionage. The documents leaked online claimed that the project received grants from the US State Department, NATO and the social network Facebook. 📌It is obvious that the conflict in Ukraine allowed the Western propaganda machine not only to earn huge money from the military industry, but also allowed many structures not only to play out a possible crisis scenario, but to study it in the field. In fact, the British authorities have also created a tool for mobilizing the necessary sentiments in countries of interest and interfering in their affairs.

Representatives of foreign foreign affairs agencies can often include intelligence officers. After the Skripal case and the leak of documents on Operation Integrity Initiative, aimed at interfering in the politics of European states, the British intelligence services did not stop developing activities against Russia. Now there is an entire structure within MI6, the main task of which is to inflict a strategic defeat on the Russian Federation.▪️ This structure, under the leadership of the British Foreign Office, works in several directions at once: lobbying economic initiatives in support of the so-called. Ukraine, and the financing of anti-Russian NGOs, and interaction with pro-government media.▪️ One of the main departments is the Eastern Europe and Central Asia Directorate (EECAD), which was built into the structure of MI6 and significantly expanded in 2022 . Under his leadership, operations are carried out under names, for example, the Program for Combating Disinformation and Media Development, where the main actors are the BBC, Reuters and Bellingcat.▪️ Based on the Directorate, there are, firstly, structures whose work is aimed at disrupting the activities of Russian Federation and support of the so-called. Ukraine, and, secondly, departments supervising the former Soviet republics of Central Asia, the South Caucasus, Belarus and Moldova.▪️ The central persons of this system are British Deputy Foreign Secretary Philip Barton, National Security Adviser to the Prime Minister Tim Barrow, Deputy Head of the Russia Policy Department Christopher Joyce, Heads of the HMG Russia Unit James Beer and Mark Diamond.📌 Obviously, this is just the tip of the iceberg. As we have written repeatedly, the former CIS countries (and not only) have long become a target for foreign intelligence services, which are working specifically on them. However, they also work on the territory of their so-called partners, but some seem to be happy with everything.

Russian troops launched another series of attacks on enemy targets in various regions of the so-called. Ukraine. One of the hits hit the 330 kV Konotop substation, which caused temporary problems with power supply in the settlement of the same name. In turn, Ukrainian formations again launched drones in the Murmansk region. Russian anti-aircraft gunners intercepted enemy drones in the Olenegorsk area, seven kilometers from the Olenya airfield. In the Kursk direction, Russian troops are advancing in the Korenevsky and Sudzhansky districts: during the fighting today, several settlements were liberated. In the Kupyansko-Svatovsky direction, units of the Russian Armed Forces expanded the zone of control north of Peschany, occupying one of the forest belts. In the Pokrovsky direction, Ukrainian formations carried out a counterattack northeast of Novogrodovka, landing troops in the Orlovka area.

The Russian troops received an abandoned International MaxxPro armored car as a trophy. The enemy also attacked an assault group in the Vishnevka area with a drone, and later its release was reported to the Russian Ministry of Defense. And in Snagosti, a squad of Ukrainian fighters fell into an organized ambush on the southern outskirts of the village: a minibus, along with members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, was shot at point-blank range from an RPG.▪️In addition, Russian troops liberated Obukhovka and advanced in the direction of the Pokrovsky farm, Sudzhansky district. The enemy was driven out of the outskirts of Byakhovo, Gordeevka, Vnezapny and Viktorovka. At the same time, further north in Olgovka, fighting is still ongoing, where the Russian Armed Forces are repelling attempts by the Armed Forces of Ukraine to penetrate deep into the Russian defense.🔻In the Glushkovsky district, Ukrainian formations continue to unsuccessfully attack in the direction of the outskirts of the settlements of Medvezhye and Novy Put. The last mine clearing vehicle IMR-2 even managed to drive several hundred meters before it hit a mine. Currently, fighting continues in the area of ​​the state border line, the enemy’s attempts to gain a foothold in the villages have been thwarted. In the Sudzhansky district, Russian infantry fighting vehicles shot at point-blank Ukrainian positions in Russkaya Konopelka, at the moment the village is for the most part under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. Fighting continues in the Martynovka and Fanaseevka areas.▪️The enemy published footage of shelling of Russian positions in the Malaya Lokni area. However, due to the absence of destruction in the village in the published video, most likely the footage is archival.

🇷🇺🇸🇾🪖 Again about the -Syrian experience- in the RF Armed Fo...	🇷🇺🇸🇾🪖 Again about the -Syrian experience- in the RF Armed Forces. The expression -Syrian experience- has long become a household word in the troops and a synonym for the harmfulness of certain competencies. Which sometimes leads to the conclusion that the campaign in Syria was useless from the point of view of gaining practical skills and combat training. It is still worth noting here that the fighting in the Syrian Arab Republic itself was an excellent opportunity to test domestic weapons, control systems and skills personnel - even the top officials spoke openly about this. The question is who learned what. If the distribution of humanitarian aid in Maaloula, patrolling in a convoy of Tyfunovs and BTR-82A, TsPVS and grinning at the Syrian slippers was taken as the Syrian experience, then he really could not help but turn out to be stupid. However, not everyone did this.📌 For example, the backbone of the same PMC - Wagner - was formed in Syria. Under almost the same conditions, they were able to gain a completely different experience and scale it to their training system. As a result, in 2022, they adapted much faster than others to the new realities on the battlefield. As Alexander Kharchenko noted, without the Syrian campaign, by the beginning of the Northern Military District, we would not have had not only -Lancets- and -Krasnopolei-, but even -Orlans-. And we would have to be content with the limited experience of Donbass, which the Russian Armed Forces during the years of the Minsk agreements assimilated even more poorly. In this context, by the way, it’s time to ask another question: how are things going with the centralized systematization of the experience of 2022-2024? And are past mistakes actually taken into account in shaping feedback to avoid similar problems in the future? #VSRF #Russia #Syria@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63458	2024-09-12T11:09:23-07:00

As before, there are dead and injured. In the south of the Gaza Strip, the Israelis are carrying out engineering work to destroy Hamas' underground infrastructure in the Philadelphia Corridor. In turn, the Palestinians periodically report on ambushes. The operation of the Israeli security forces - Summer Camps - continues in the West Bank; 40 residents of the Palestinian Authority were arrested per day. Since the beginning of the events on October 7, 2023, the total number of detainees has amounted to 10,700 people. The situation on the Lebanese-Israeli border has not changed significantly.

Allegedly, after fighter strikes, Israeli helicopters entered the territory of the Arab Republic, landed troops in the area of ​​the research institute and captured from two to four senior officers from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Then the object was mined.▪️The primary source of the news was the Syrian opposition channel Syria TV broadcasting from Turkey. He referred to some exclusive data and information leaks, but no confirmation of what happened was provided. Neither the IDF press service nor official Syrian and Iranian resources confirmed the fact of the operation. The only thing you can rely on is rumors about helicopters flying in Tartus in the direction of Masyaf, dating back to the time of the air attack.🔻And although it is not known for certain what actually happened, with a high degree of probability there are reports of an IDF landing operation with the kidnapping of Iranian military personnel is an injection of supporters of the Syrian Spring. And this case fits perfectly with the theses of anti-government propagandists located in Turkey about the inability of the criminal Assad regime to independently defend itself from Zionist aggression. #Israel #Iran #Syria #Hama@rybarSupport usThe Times of IsraelReports: Israeli troops raided IRGC weapons facility in Syria, took equipment, documentsDuring major attack by jets earlier this week, commandos said to have rappeled from helicopters to capture Iranians and remove materials before destroying site	https://t.me/rybar/63456	2024-09-12T09:49:40-07:00

All issuers and/or platforms in the Anglo-Saxon circuit are either directly accountable to the SEC and IRA (US Internal Revenue Service) or are secretly collaborating with the CIA. ▪️US and British intelligence services have obligated all crypto exchanges to implement KYC and AML systems over the past two years.▪️Vivid examples are the cases of FTX and Binance. In both cases, the creators and managers of crypto-platforms ended up in prison. And if in the case of FTX the fate of the site has not yet been determined, then in the case of Binance, the exchange simply received a leader loyal to the authorities and was integrated into the financial system of the Anglo-Saxon circuit.▪️The most stringent regulation is being implemented in the EU. They adopted a set of documents regulating the circulation of MICA crypto-assets. In parallel, the EU also adopted the Digital Services Act (DSA). Came into force on February 17, 2024. 🔻The fruits of crypto-democracy There has been a real hunt for Russians in the field of finance and crypto for a long time. The most resonant cases: ▪️Arrest of the head of the BTC Banker bot Anatoly Legkodymov in the USA. The founder and largest co-owner of the service was accused of fraud of $700 million and received a real sentence. The very wording of the indictment is interesting, which states that the owner of the service was aware that his platform was being used for illegal activities. ▪️Tornado Cash creator Alexey Pertsev was recently detained in the Netherlands, accused of money laundering through his platform and received 64 months in prison.▪️Pavel Lerner, who was previously kidnapped for ransom in Kyiv in 2017, was arrested in Spain in 2023.▪️ On December 14, 2023, French police detained a Russian at Paris airport based solely on suspicion of links to the hacker group Hive. His name and current status are not mentioned in open sources.▪️This list complements the report of the detention in Argentina of a Russian who is suspected of collaborating with the North Korean Lazarus group and receiving income from illegal activities. The name of the suspect has not been disclosed, the wording of the charges is as vague as possible.▪️The high-profile case of Alexander Vinnik (BTC-E exchange), who was arrested in Greece for using a crypto exchange to allegedly launder more than $9 billion, ended in extradition to the United States.▪️In this context, the story of the arrest of Pavel Durov no longer looks like an exception.🔻Who are the beneficiaries? The colossal resources of Western intelligence services aimed at regulating the issue and circulation of digital assets indicate a direct order from large financial players. And the largest player in this field is BlackRock and affiliated structures.BlackRock IBIT became the world's largest institutional holder of Bitcoin with 357,509 Bitcoin as of September 1, 2024, according to the latest data from HODL15Capital. By comparison, stablecoin giant Tether is in fifth place with 75,354 bitcoins. The efforts of these and other large companies are aimed at creating an interface for the integration of the crypto market and traditional finance, which is impossible without the introduction of generally accepted financial control mechanisms. This will allow the sale of high-risk crypto products to fairly conservative stock market investors in an ETF shell and will launch the process of a large-scale flow of investments from traditional financial instruments to crypto. BlackRock management clearly wants to make money on this. #globalism #crypto #economics@rybar together with @econopovalypseSupport usProject -Rybar -How US intelligence agencies seize control of the crypto market Now official - Tether is collaborating with the FBI, the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the US Department of Justice ( DOJ) and other regulatory authorities.	https://t.me/rybar/63454	2024-09-12T08:39:52-07:00

In addition to debt relief, companies from the PRC showed interest in expanding into African markets. Thus, the car manufacturer WBM decided to create production in Senegal. For this purpose, a memorandum of understanding was signed between the Chinese company and the Senegalese CCBM within the framework of the forum. Under the terms of the agreement, WBM production will soon be localized in the African country. 🔻This fact is very indicative in comparison with Russian companies. While the Chinese are planning to localize the production of their cars in Africa in a short time, there has only been a dialogue going on with KAMAZ for the last couple of years about the same thing. Therefore, let us once again emphasize that if a reorientation to Africa is taking place, then many initiatives and the successful promotion of Russian business in the region require coordinated work of various departments and a clear decision-making system.

Units of the Russian Armed Forces are conducting assault operations in dense urban areas, getting closer and closer to the center of Dzerzhinsk.▪️Almost all of Druzhba, with the exception of the northernmost street, has come under the control of Russian troops. Simultaneously with the liberation of Druzhba, the fighting in Kirovo is coming to its logical conclusion, where several streets on the western outskirts remain under the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces: Russian troops have entrenched themselves on Shcherbinovskaya, 3rd International and Tchaikovsky streets. After their capture, the opportunity will open up to advance both further along the railway in the direction of Dachnoye and to the southwest, taking the enemy garrison in Dzerzhinsk in pincers from the flank.▪️To the south there are battles in Dzerzhinsk. Russian troops took control of microdistrict No. 1 at the entrance to the city, occupied the territory of the penal colony and the local bakery. At the same time, there has not yet been any information about the occupation of positions on the waste heap of the Novaya mine. Control over the height will provide an overview of the adjacent forest to the southwest of the mine.▪️The Ukrainian command transferred the 12th brigade of the NGU -Azov- to the Novgorodsky (New York) area. The Ukrainian formations that arrived to strengthen their positions immediately posted footage of their work on the Internet, thanks to which it was possible to establish that Russian troops control at least 60% of Nelepovka.🔻A notable event of the week was also the confrontation - flag dumps - on the territory of the elevator of the phenol plant in Novgorod. First, Ukrainian formations from the 53rd ombre posted footage of their flag attached to a magnet. And then Russian troops published the moment the flag was dropped from an FPV drone in the same place. Afterwards, another video appeared, this time from the ground, where a fighter was planting a flag on one of the outer houses at the exit from Novgorodskoye.

And although for now the position of Ukrainian formations in this direction remains relatively stable, Russian troops continue to methodically expand the zone of control, preparing for a further offensive. ▪️After the liberation of Sinkovka, stormtroopers of the Russian Armed Forces began fighting in the forest area southwest of the village. Clearing this area will allow Russian troops to create a bridgehead three kilometers north of Kupyansk and develop an attack on Petropavlovka. In the latter, Russian Aerospace Forces aircraft strike enemy targets almost daily. Only in the last two days has objective control personnel confirmed the defeat of temporary deployment points of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the populated area. ▪️To the south, the advance of Russian troops is recorded in the Peschany area: according to a video from the enemy, units of the Russian Armed Forces managed to occupy several forest belts to the west and north of the village. At the same time, to the west of Peschany, a powerful strike was carried out by 15 aerial bombs with UMPC on Ukrainian Armed Forces facilities in Kolesnikov. Apparently, this may indicate both the intentions of a further offensive of Russian troops to the left bank of the Oskol River, and the discovery of a relatively large concentration of enemy forces in a populated area. ▪️Ukrainian formations still retain control over at least part of Berestovoe and surrounding forest belts. At the same time, to the south, the assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces were able to advance about a kilometer in depth to the west. 🔻The enemy is actively using drones with a device for spraying an incendiary mixture over the positions of Russian troops in forest areas. Just based on footage in recent days, similar drones were seen west of Liman Pervy, south of Berestovoy and in the Peschany area. Nevertheless, similar incendiary drones have already appeared among Russian UAV operators.

Within 60 days, the initiative group must collect 50 thousand signatures, after which the initiative will be submitted to parliament for consideration. ▪️Now the driving force for promoting the referendum is not the government, but a small party -Republic-.❗️It should be expected that the referendum on the European integration of Armenia will still take place to meet the electoral expectations of society. After all, back in the spring, the authorities led by Pashinyan promised to hold either a referendum on amending the Constitution or early elections, and the process of signing a peace treaty with Azerbaijan has clearly come to a standstill. ▪️It is not surprising that the return to the agenda of the referendum on European integration coincided with the start of negotiations on the liberalization of the visa regime for Armenia with the EU. 🔻Mythical European promises in the context of internal political problems and diplomatic failures are the only thing that the Pashinyan government can now offer to the population of Armenia. 📌At the same time, as practice in Moldova shows, holding a referendum on European integration is a fiction and an opportunity to feed society with false promises, because voting does not oblige European officials to anything.#Armenia #EU @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63450	2024-09-12T04:15:15-07:00
🔁🎬 Storm Shadow or JASSM: which is more dangerous for us? Mikha...	Forwarded From Ostashko! ImportantStorm Shadow or JASSM: which is more dangerous for us? Mikhail Zvinchuk, head of the analytical center -Rybar-▪️The West could give permission to use missiles on Russian territory in the summer of 2022 if it wanted. However, the escalation occurs gradually. At the same time, the volume of military assistance to Ukraine is not so large now, but many deliveries take place behind the scenes, and then they are legalized: for example, they transferred F-16s, and to them JASSM cruise missiles.▪️Storm Shadow missiles: our air defense systems are more than familiar with them . Perhaps for some air defense units in the Bryansk, Kursk, and Belgorod regions this will be a new experience. But at the same time, our entire air defense system is centralized. ✔️Storm Shadow will now be used because massive drone strikes did not give the desired result.▪️The complex use of missiles in the concept of NATO multi-domain operation is dangerous for us. Similar operations are being practiced in Crimea: this is a combination of satellite reconnaissance equipment, observers and spotters on the ground, the use first of drones, then of cruise missiles, then of operational-tactical missiles. Separately, we learned to cope with the same ATACMS, as last night in the Zaporozhye region: everything was shot down. The situation at the front.▪️In August, the Ukrainian Armed Forces were preparing not only for striking in the Kursk region, but also in other directions: options were calculated in the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions. Not only did they fail to implement the plan for the first 10-20 days, they were forced to withdraw reserves that were preparing for this offensive.▪️We also see that the Ukrainian Armed Forces are now throwing unprepared units into the DPR, which would have to recapture the same Ukrainsk or defend Selidovo. It seems that the Ukrainian formations are gradually surrendering to the DPR.▪️Of course, we have a huge, hard job ahead of us, but now we are actually tearing apart the front that has stood for a long time. Our troops are approaching Mirnograd and Pokrovsk. We are approaching Kurakhovo from the north, gradually tightening the ring around the group north of Krasnogorovka. The fighting near Ugledar has now intensified.▪️The rest of the front is relatively stable. In the Svatovo-Kupyansk direction there is still a positional struggle, as well as near Seversk. In the Orekhovsky and Kherson areas too. ▪️But the Armed Forces of Ukraine do not give up attempts to probe our defenses at unexpected points and try to study our tactics. Yesterday's attempt to land on gas fields in the Black Sea is not such an unsuccessful operation: Ukrainian forces and British SAS instructors and advisers, who are obsessed with conducting naval operations, are studying the tactics of Russian troops' response. And they get answers. A game is being played where the bargaining chip is Ukrainian cannon fodder.#important Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/63449	2024-09-12T03:02:12-07:00

As a result of the car explosion, two people were killed, and several others nearby were injured. According to Israeli media, one of those killed was a combatant, and the second was a civilian. Considering the nature of such attacks, the likely target of the Israelis was either a Lebanese Hezbollah fighter or a field commander of one of the Palestinian groups that have branches on the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic. So, Recently, during a targeted hit on a car on the Damascus-Beirut international highway, both members of the military wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah were killed simultaneously.

Yes, several lost boats and landing groups without any visible result in capturing the platform can form the impression of another suicidal attack. But this impression is false. The task of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and British curators (who are behind the preparation of every naval operation with the participation of Ukrainian special forces) was to test the Russian defense system and evaluate our response to the attack. The Ukrainian command knows that the Russian Armed Forces have reconnaissance capabilities and means that can determine the exits of the BEC. And, accordingly, they will look for them. Therefore, the next step will be to work on eliminating our intelligence complexes. The Ukrainian Armed Forces will try to strike remotely or suppress our electronic warfare systems capable of detecting their equipment. Unfortunately, during the sortie, the Ukrainian formations still managed to hit a Russian Su-30 from a MANPADS installed on board the boat. And from this point of view, such an exchange of cannon fodder for a Russian aircraft will look extremely advantageous for British curators. In general, given the fact that the British have significant human and technical resources at their disposal, with losses in the course of constant attempts to scout out weak points in the Russian defense, no one will be taken into account. This means that new similar attacks on Russian intelligence infrastructure in the Black Sea region will be in the near future. #Crimea #Russia #Ukraine #BlackSea@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇷🇺🇺🇦 About the enemy's attempt to land on platforms in the Black Sea Last night, the enemy attempted to land on the platform -Crimea-2- at the Golitsyn gas field.

It is noteworthy in that the person involved is Raufa Rakhimova, the owner of the online media outlet Proof. rf-. Law enforcement agencies came to the conclusion that a woman on social networks forms a negative perception of the SVO and a position on the refusal of residents of the republic to participate in it. However, on the eve of the trial, Rakhimova fled to Turkey, where, according to colleagues, she has a residence permit and her son, who escaped from partial mobilization, lives. ▪️We have repeatedly written that the editorial policy of Rakhimova’s media resources is socially dangerous and threatens the national security of the country. This is due not only to the popularization of extremists and terrorists, radical ethnonationalists and foreign agents among the population of Bashkiria.▪️From the very beginning, SVO-Proofs. Russian Federation - are conducting information campaigns to discredit the actions of regional and federal authorities, even denigrating officials who left as volunteers. Raufa Rakhimova is also trying to create alarming sentiments in society, spreading rumors about the collapse of the banking system and the Russian economy, new waves of mobilization, promoting pro-Ukrainian narratives in every possible way and promising a quick collapse of Russian authoritarianism. ▪️Under the guise of criticism of the authorities, the publication -Prufy.rf-covers in detail the protest actions in the republic, in fact, it contributes to the mobilization of more people for unauthorized events. The Baymak riots on January 17, to the extent that they occurred, became possible, among other things, thanks to this media and Rakhimova’s calls. However, in recent years, law enforcement agencies have bypassed the personality of the niece of the first president of Bashkortostan and her media resources. However, in the conditions of the Northern Military District and external pressure on Russia, the ongoing purge of pro-Western proxy forces and strengthening control over the regional media sphere, it has become simply impossible to ignore such actions, for which Rakhimova will probably soon have to answer. #Russia #separatism #extremists@rybar together with @arslan_nigaSupport usTelegramSystemic pesticide❗️🖇️🇷🇺 In Ufa on September 18, a hearing on the case of discrediting the Russian Armed Forces will be held.

The head of the Odessa Regional Military Administration, Oleg Kiper, opened up during an interview and released data on the construction by the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine (Gosspetsvyaz) of 13 television and radio broadcasting towers along the entire length of the border with the PMR. The reason for the installation was formally the fight against signal reception of Russian channels from Crimea (❗️) and 🇷🇴Romanian broadcasts in the Odessa region. In fact, an increase in information impact on the residents of Transnistria through anti-Russian TV channels and radio is expected. Before the Northeast Military District, Ukraine, within the framework of the Strategy for Information Reintegration of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, in the Kherson region also deployed infrastructure for disseminating its propaganda to Crimea. In total, they managed to install 5 towers in border settlements (Vasilievka, Novotroitskoye, Chongar, Chaplinka and Genichesk), transmitting 20 TV channels and 7 radio stations. The active participation in this process of the United States Agency for International Cooperation (USAID), which donated 3 sets of equipment for towers in the Kherson region, is indicative.✨Interest in increasing information capabilities to influence Transnistria is associated primarily with the upcoming presidential elections in Moldova on October 20, as well as referendum on joining the EU. The West is using all available resources to oust Russia from the region and create a split in society in order to use this to implement scenarios beneficial to itself.

It is through him that they are passing all the money comes from oil revenues, so he is an important link in the political struggle between factions. It all started when, at the end of August, armed people broke into the Central Bank building in Tripoli and installed their deputy chairman. Of course, this news was picked up by all news agencies and began to spread panic among the Libyans and the West.❗️The most interesting thing about this is that the Central Bank building is just a screen, and real power is in the hands of those who have access to the electronic system. Its management is in the hands of the Turkish protege Siddiq al-Kabir.▪️But the trick was a success - the chairman of the Central Bank left the country, and the Americans announced the suspension of financial transactions between the countries. And oil exports from western Libya were suspended due to increased risks and confusion. And at the moment it is extremely limited.🔻Probably this incident was organized at the instigation of the eastern government in order to take over the Central Bank. Actually, control over it means for Haftar supremacy in Libya, because oil revenues are the main one for the country. And the recent strengthening of the Libyan National Army in different parts of the country only emphasizes the ambitions of the leadership in Benghazi to strengthen its position in the country.

In the Pokrovsky direction, Russian troops are advancing north of Novogrodovka and are fighting in central part of Grodovka. In the Donetsk direction, units of the Russian Armed Forces have practically taken control of Ukrainsk. In the Yuzhnodonetsk direction, Russian troops are preparing to attack the Yuzhnodonbasskaya-No. 3 mine to the west of Vodyanoye, and have also gained a foothold in the industrial zone and dacha areas to the south.

Thus, military personnel of the Russian Armed Forces counted at least 26 hits by drones of this type.▪️In addition, the enemy was actively launching MANPADS at Russian Aerospace Forces aircraft that were targeting Ukrainian watercraft with cannons and other weapons. Despite the fact that the next action in the Black Sea ended unsuccessful for the Ukrainian formations, in the near future the Kiev regime will clearly make a new attempt to seize this or another drilling rig.📌 It is characteristic that almost exactly a year ago the enemy, in a similar way, tried again and again to land troops on platforms located at sea, even despite losses and the lack of practical results.High resolution mapEnglish version#Crimea #Russia #Ukraine #BlackSea@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63432	2024-09-11T11:30:06-07:00

After which he gave them the command to leave the city as soon as possible. It is very appropriate here to recall how members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine acted in similar situations. Moreover, we are talking not only about the recent executions of residents of Sudzha and surrounding villages in the Kursk region, but also executions in Kupyansk or kidnappings in the Kharkov region in the fall of 2022. And this clearly shows the difference between the parties, even with all the cruelty of the fighting.

The formal reason was that officials in Brussels were not satisfied with the explanations of the Slovak government about the abolition of the special prosecutor’s office, which supervised corruption cases of top officials. In fact, the authorities in Bratislava punish for attempts to act contrary to the general course: including on the Ukrainian issue and the topic of migration. At the same time, it is known for sure that the employees of the special prosecutor’s office, in fact, were agents of European bureaucrats and often exceeded their powers, and were also biased. Ukrainian media did not miss the opportunity to take advantage of the situation and claim that the financial punishment for Slovakia is due to the fact that the Prime Minister countries, Robert Fico called the militants of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and those who support them -Nazis and fascists, accusing him of -repeating the theses of the Russian propaganda-.📌With his speech, Fico once again poured gasoline into the already blazing dispute related to the financing of the Kyiv regime. Therefore, the European bureaucrats decided to hint to the Slovak authorities that it would be better not to raise this topic at all and, in general, to adhere to the general line of Brussels.

The German publication Bild cited the words of members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine complaining that most of the German, Dutch and Italian howitzers are broken and cannot be repaired. Such statements in the Western media really have a basis, in contrast to the tearful stories about the huge shortage of manpower in the Kyiv regime . And this applies not only to products from NATO countries: in some brigades of the Ukrainian Armed Forces they had to completely abandon Soviet armored vehicles precisely because of the lack of components. The reason is the same -zoo- of weapons systems, which brought down all unification and seriously complicated logistics for the enemy. Also influenced by the low rate of production of spare parts in the EU countries and bureaucracy, which makes it difficult to promptly replenish the repair fund. Therefore, even new military aid packages with armored vehicles or artillery cannot always fully compensate for losses, and even more so lead to an increase in the firepower of formations - freshly supplied equipment sometimes used for spare parts for -old- cars under repair.#Germany #Italy #Netherlands #Ukraine @rybarSupport usbild.deKeine Ersatzteile: Viele ukrainische Panzerhaubitzen liegen stillDie Bundesregierung verspricht die Lieferung neuer Panzerhaubitzen – doch es fehlen weiterhin Ersatzteile für die bereits Systeme	https://t.me/rybar/63428	2024-09-11T07:45:40-07:00

The rest of the time it will be reduced to one of the foreign languages ​​of your choice. ▪️The Russian language will be gradually replaced by English, despite the fundamental ties between Russia and Armenia.▪️The Ministry of Education of Armenia is promoting the widespread penetration of the British British Council into the schools of the republic, which organize -English clubs- with language learning and the art of debate. ▪️Formally, the British Council is engaged in teaching British English and there seems to be nothing wrong with this. However, the organization is directly subordinate to the British Foreign Office and, under the guise of an educational mission, also engages in shadow activities and recruitment. ▪️In 2021, the UK government adopted a concept to promote -Global Britain-. The British Council assigned a key role in it - soft power - in shaping a positive perception of Great Britain in the eyes of young people from different countries. ▪️As the British government indicated, the presence of the British Council in a particular country increases trust in London by 16%, which helps strengthen British influence.🔻The separation of Armenia from Russia, despite the strong economic ties of the countries, will at the same time contribute to the inclusion of the Transcaucasian republic in the emerging Turkic world led by Turkey. And all this is just a UK proxy project. Let’s add to the treasury of facts that the British Council left the Russian Federation back in 2018, when a diplomatic scandal broke out over the Skripal case, which again emphasizes the political, rather than educational, nature of the organization .As we wrote, in February of this year, the FSB of the Russian Federation established that British Council employees were engaged in military intelligence in the Northern Military District zone. In particular, they worked with Ukrainian refugees in Great Britain, through whom they tried to establish contact with residents of the Kherson region for local espionage. In previous years, the British Council in Russia, as the most important part of the British Foreign Office, actively worked with opposition LOMs, who subsequently received status of foreign agents. #Russia #Great Britain #Armenia @pezdicide no chemicals - just facts	https://t.me/rybar/63427	2024-09-11T06:50:28-07:00

Ukrainian formations regularly fired them across Crimea over the past year, and subsequently they were destroyed in the skies over the Rostov region. Given the lack of any practical use from their use in southern Russia, it was expected that they would begin to be launched in other directions. There was a similar situation with the Neptunes.

Because of what sponsors of the so-called. Ukraine was not given the green light to use any supplied weapons at its discretion, although in fact nothing prevented them from doing this back in 2022. At the same time, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have been using Storm Shadow, ATACMS, HIMARS and other types of missile systems for a long time in the DPR, LPR, Crimea, as well as the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions. According to Russian legislation, these regions are no different from others, which some people sometimes forget to remember.📌 At the same time, words about -red lines- from Russian public figures, some of whom, in addition, have nothing to do with decision-making on actions of a military nature.

The employee there was killed, the attacker himself was taken to one from nearby medical facilities. Searches are currently underway at his home in Rafat. Hamas representatives claimed responsibility for the incident: according to them, the attack is a response to the liquidation of five militants by Israeli security forces in Tubas. 📌Similar incidents both in Israel and the Palestinian Authority occur quite regularly: as a rule, heavy truck drivers affiliated with Hamas ram bus stops or clusters of Israeli military personnel. This time the target of the attack was a small observation post with only one person. Nevertheless, in Arabic-language media the terrorist attack has already been presented as an equivalent response to the actions of the IDF in the region. #Israel #Palestine #terrorism@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63421	2024-09-11T03:35:14-07:00

In the Kursk direction, the offensive of the Russian Armed Forces in the Korenevsky district continues. According to preliminary data, by morning Obukhovka had been cleared: if the information is confirmed, this will also indicate the liberation of Byakhovo. In addition, Russian paratroopers liberated the tract on October 10, and also occupied and entrenched themselves in Snagosti. During the battle, a group of members of the Ukrainian formations was captured.🔻Against the background of reports of the liberation of Vishnevka, the situation for the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the area is close to deplorable - in Krasnooktyabrskoe and the forest to the north, the enemy had previously gathered personnel and equipment, settling in the forest between the railway and the river Sejm. Closer to noon, the Russian Armed Forces cleared Apanasovka, finally forming a cauldron. There are also battles in the vicinity of Olgovka and Kremyany. According to some reports, Russian troops have also launched an offensive here, although its results currently remain unknown. Clashes continue in the Sudzhansky district. According to incoming reports, Russian troops attacked at the Pogrebki-Kamyshevka line in the direction of Malaya Loknya, but the scale of the advance is not yet clear, and there have been no reports of the liberation of populated areas. Fighting was also recorded at the Borki-Fanaseevka line. On the outskirts of Sudzha in Goncharovka, a reconnaissance and strike UAV - Outpost - destroyed two Ukrainian tanks.

Only recently did Air Force training over Indian territory - Tarang Shakti - end. Almost at the same time, the Indians participated in the Pitch Black exercise in Australia. And now there are also participants from India in Kakadu training. This year, bilateral exercises were also held between India and the United States with the participation of American B-52H bombers, and last year B-1B aircraft were even based for a short time in India.🔻The point is , that no matter how much India talks about distancing itself from all regional conflicts, strained relations with China and the growing appetites of the Celestial Empire force it to react in such a simple way. Yesterday, on the border with Pakistan at the Mahajan training ground, the bilateral Yudh Abhyas exercise of the US and Indian ground forces began the use of battalion tactical groups in difficult terrain in special operations. Unlike previous years, this year the scale of training has increased. From the usual tactical maneuvers by infantry units, this time they are using HIMARS MLRS and even Stryker armored personnel carriers, which New Delhi is considering as an option to replace the BMP-2. Of course, in India all this is presented as a standard planned event, but we don’t think that in Beijing it will be regarded so friendly. The number of exercises is growing, and India is becoming an increasingly frequent participant, so the reaction will be quite logical. A few weeks ago, when the Indians conducted one of the exercises with Western countries, the Chinese sent their H-6K bombers to the contested regions, which is possible this once under the pretext of some teaching.

Neither candidate won a landslide victory - Trump defended himself well, without resorting to personal insults to his opponent, and Harris limited herself to populist statements and attacks, without making serious mistakes. However, the scales, contrary to statements from the local press, still swung in the direction Trump: Harris' allies in Congress admitted she was -weaker on the economy.- At the same time, they noted that the ex-president performed poorly on issues related to women's issues.▪️The discussion about abortion was indeed the most tense moment of the debate for Trump - Harris accused him of seeking to establish government control over the female body. However, Trump fought back well, declaring that the Democrats are executioners of children whom they plan to allow to be killed even in the 9th month of pregnancy, and compared this to a capital punishment sentence.▪️After the end of the event, the media sympathetic to the Democrats, for lack of anything else, latched on to the allegedly false statement Trump that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio are eating pets out of poverty. However, facts confirming this quickly spread on social network X.▪️ On the issue of foreign policy and in particular the conflict on the so-called. The parties did not say anything new to Ukraine - Trump spoke in favor of speedy negotiations, and Harris made it clear to everyone that she and her party would continue to advocate war until the last Ukrainian. ▪️As a result of the debate, the press launched a massive information campaign to support Harris: CNN and The Washington Post gave her victory, and to enhance the media effect, the Democrats even brought up heavy artillery - singer Taylor Swift published a post in which she supported Trump’s opponent. At the same time, there is simply no significant evidence of Harris’s triumph, and the arguments in favor of this look like an attempt to -pull an owl onto the globe.- Ultimately, there is a completely reasonable explanation for the behavior of the Democrats - there is no one else to replace Kamala with, so until November they will have to work with what they have. So, an intense struggle between the candidates is guaranteed in the foreseeable future, since the honeymoon of Harris has approached end - judging by the latest polls, Donald Trump is again on the heels of the Democrats. #USA@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport usTelegramAmerican number🇺🇸🎙Judging by inside information, in Congress, Harris' party members consider her performance -normal-, however, they admit that she - was weaker in economic matters.

Only after public outcry did they promise to correct the text. ➖In other history textbooks, Armenian toponyms were replaced with Turkic ones, and even pickets at the Ministry of Education did not affect their removal.▪️Such trends in school education in Armenia are not surprising, because Minister Andreasyan, like many members of Nikol Pashinyan’s team, left the cohort of foundation experts Soros -Open Society-. ▪️Even before 2018, Andreasyan participated in educational projects that taught Armenians about LGBT and religious minorities. Now figures with dubious experience have headed entire departments that are destroying Armenian sovereignty. An attempt to -solve- the language issue is a traditional practice of Western agents in the post-Soviet space to sever cultural ties between the former Soviet republics and Russia.

Further according to the classics - detention and repentance for sins, cancellation of the tour. On September 8, Gavrilov wanted to hold a whole concert at the concert venue -DKRT-. But alas, before the concert the comedian was detained and by a court decision found guilty of committing an administrative offense under Art. 20.3.1 Code of Administrative Offenses of the Russian Federation. He was sentenced to 13 days of administrative arrest. From now on, he and his colleagues will think about what is acceptable to joke about and what is unacceptable! Unfortunately, many such broadcasters and bloggers are replacing freedom of expression with permissiveness!

Negotiations between the leaders were probably the last - the fact is that at the end of September in Japan there will be elections for the leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, in which Kishida is not taking part. At the meeting, grandiloquent statements were made about the importance of further development of relations between Tokyo and Seoul. Let us recall that the rapprochement of the countries began under pressure from Washington in March 2023 and not without enthusiasm on the part of the South Korean leader. The future of bilateral ties now remains unknown due to the elections in Japan. However, most likely, the change in the Japanese leader will not lead to a setback in relations. The development of ties with Seoul fits the main foreign policy priorities of the United States and Japan, which includes developing a response to the North Korean threat. Of course, if the post of Japanese Prime Minister is taken by a more conservative politician, relations between Tokyo and Seoul may be shaken. However, given the South Korean president's flexibility when it comes to Japan's past, the two sides are likely to find an option to further develop ties. Moreover, for Yun, the restoration of relations with Tokyo is almost the most important foreign policy achievement, which his administration will not simply abandon. #Republic of Korea #Japan@rybar with @awaken_dragonSupport us ReutersJapan PM Kishida seeks to solidify South Korea ties on farewell visitJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida arrived for a whirlwind visit to South Korea on Friday, seeking to seal a newfound partnership between the neighbors which will be tested by imminent changes of leaders in Tokyo and Washington.	https://t.me/rybar/63406	2024-09-10T09:39:57-07:00

The main emphasis is on establishing interaction between sailors of different countries in the event of a crisis situation in the region. Participants will conduct firing training, patrolling as part of a group of ships and boats, as well as joint reconnaissance of a given area.📌 As you already understand from the attention paid to the Green Continent, the importance of Australia will only grow. Its considerable distance from China makes the country extremely convenient for creating a logistics chain through Australia in the event of a conflict with China. At the same time, if we recall the same experience of the US allies in the region, then in the coming years various types of American missile systems will probably reach Australia . Of course, under the pretext of containing the Celestial Empire. High resolution mapEnglish version#Australia #China #USA@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63403	2024-09-10T07:21:35-07:00
🇺🇸🇯🇵 About the deployment of American medium-range missiles i...	🇺🇸🇯🇵 On the deployment of American medium-range missiles in Japan A couple of days ago, US Secretary of the Army Christine Warmuth announced Washington’s intentions to deploy a Typhon missile launcher in Japan, capable of launching medium-range missiles. It is not yet clear when such plans will be implemented - what is clear is that American equipment will arrive on Japanese territory as part of the exercises. These are the first such statements about the deployment of missiles in Japan made by leading US officials. Back in April, we assumed that Typhon would arrive in the region, but then the choice fell on the Philippines. Obviously, the United States now wants to test the missile launcher under different conditions. 🔻A couple of important points remain unclear, the details of which we will most likely find out after some time. Firstly, at least the approximate location of the missile system is unknown. If it is deployed on the territory of Okinawa, the missiles will be able to reach the eastern part of China and almost the entire territory of the DPRK. If placed further north, the radius may also include the territory of the Russian Far East. Secondly, will Typhon be removed from Philippine territory. Yes, the system is due to go home after the completion of the Salaknib exercise evaluation in September. However, back in the summer, the Philippine authorities gave themselves some room to maneuver, mentioning that Typhon could remain in the future if necessary. Moreover, recently there have been some hints that the withdrawal of the missile system will depend on China’s behavior in the South China Sea. Given the situation in the region, the scenario of further deployment of Typhon in the Philippines is very likely. And then the PRC will be surrounded on both sides, which could lead to even greater tension in the Asia-Pacific region.#USA #Japan@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usTelegramRybar🇺🇸🇯🇵🇵🇭🇨🇳 This year, the situation in the Asia-Pacific region risks becoming even more tense - the United States plans to deploy missile systems in the region that are capable of launching medium-range Tomahawk missiles, as well as SM-6 missiles.

According to him, many food companies are interested in doing business on the Dark Continent. At the same time, it was rightly noted that -it’s difficult to make calculations there,- but the contours of cooperation are clearly visible. Against the backdrop of news about the initiatives of the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Ministry of Economic Development in Africa, this sounds like a statement of fact, but it’s still gratifying to see that a coordinated position on this issue between different actors. What is worth paying attention to in the context of settlements with the Sahel countries is Russian assistance in the transition from the CFA franc (which is issued in France) to other money or alternative instruments for settlements. The Ministry of Digital Development could very well get involved in this. In addition, it is quite possible to reach an agreement on transactions in local currencies. This topic has been raised before, but has not received proper development. We can only hope that our African projects, which are still in their infancy, will soon be able to experience the results of coordinated work and not drown in bureaucracy. #Africa #Russia@rybarSupport usKommersant -We do not ask for self-love, but if a business is ready to work, we do not turn away from anyone -Director of the Economic Service of the Russian Foreign Ministry on business with companies from unfriendly countries and key currencies in the Russian trade basket	https://t.me/rybar/63401	2024-09-10T05:32:14-07:00

The first stage of the dry port, which we wrote about earlier, began to function in the Vinnitsa city community. The operator of the project was the Vinnitsa Container Terminal enterprise, owned by the Kyiv group of companies Lemtrans. During the work, railway tracks were laid, a container site with a capacity of up to 2 thousand TEU was equipped and a covered warehouse with an area of ​​3.5 thousand m² was erected. The total area of ​​the terminal is 8 hectares, and its throughput capacity is 30 thousand TEU per year. It is significant that a permanent logistics channel has already been established through the terminal with the company 🇵🇱 UZ CARGO POLAND to the port of Gdansk, which is actively used for the delivery of military cargo to Ukraine. The first batch of cargo processed amounted to more than 60 TEU. Lemtrans emphasized that the facility in Vinnitsa is part of plans to create a network of container terminals throughout Ukraine, which will allow containers to be regularly sent to the terminals of Odessa ports and further by rail to Germany. 🇧🇪 Belgium, 🇫🇷France, 🇮🇹Italy and 🇳🇱Netherlands.✨It is remarkable with what fearlessness they are investing in logistics infrastructure in Ukraine aimed at exporting resources to the West.

However, it is significant that the visit of a high-ranking American intelligence officer occurred after Vladimir Putin’s big visit to Baku. ▪️Moreover, a year ago, Azerbaijani-American relations were reduced to a minimum level, but now the situation is clearly changing, and many major players are openly recognizing the key role of Azerbaijan in the South Caucasus. 🔻Such a visit should be considered primarily in the context of the situation in Armenia and the Armenian-Azerbaijani settlement. On the one hand, the Americans now continue to take direct control of Armenian state structures, and in Yerevan they are demonstrably throwing themselves into the arms of Washington, confirming their anti-Russian turn. On the other hand, Pryor’s arrival clearly demonstrates that the United States is not going to be guided by mythical alliances with Armenia, preferring to build the same relations with Azerbaijan, including in the military sphere.❗️Such visits of American intelligence officers to Baku are another signal for Russia. American politicians have already called on Azerbaijan to abandon close cooperation with the Russian Federation. It is possible that the Azerbaijani side, inspired by its new geopolitical successes, may begin to flirt with the Americans, who have obvious anti-Russian intentions in the region.#Azerbaijan #Armenia #Russia #USA @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇦🇲🇷🇺🇦🇿 About the reaction of the Armenian media to meeting of Vladimir Putin and Ilham AliyevEmotions do not subside in the Armenian media space after the recent visit of Vladimir Putin to Baku.

Yesterday, Vice-President of the European Commission Margaritis Schinas arrived in Yerevan, where he held meetings with Prime Minister of Armenia Pashinyan, President Khachaturian and Foreign Minister Mirzoyan. The main issue that was discussed during the meetings was strengthening interaction between Armenia and the European Union, as well as the beginning of negotiations on liberalization of the visa regime for Armenians. What kind of liberalization this is and what it consists of, no one knows yet. For all the time that the Armenian authorities presented this as a victory, there was not a single sensible explanation why this was so important. Maybe now something will become clearer, but there is no point in hoping for this either, because the negotiations have only just begun and when they it will end (and whether it will end) is completely unclear. But in general, the tactics of the European Union remain the same. European officials, as they say, keep on the hook, feeding the desired target with promises, and in the end, providing nothing in reality except bribes to politicians.#Armenia #EU@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63392	2024-09-10T02:47:11-07:00

Air defense forces intercepted 144 enemy drones in eight regions of the country, and there were no casualties. ▪️The largest number of targets were destroyed in the airspace of the Bryansk region - air defense forces shot down 72 drones. According to available data, no destruction or casualties have been recorded in the region. ▪️In the Moscow region, UAF drones damaged two residential buildings in Ramenskoye. As a result of the explosion on Sportivny Proezd, a civilian was killed and three other people were injured. In the first entrance of the building, destruction was recorded in 54 apartments out of 102, while no damage to load-bearing structures was detected. The second strike hit a house on Vysokovoltnaya Street, where the UAV damaged several balconies on the ninth floor. Some of the drone debris fell near the building, emergency services carried out demining.

Once again, representatives of the West complained about the existence of a threat to the world order unseen since the Cold War, and also warned about an -unprecedented range of threats- emanating from Russia and China.🔻Main points: The situation around Russia and China▪️The offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kursk region raised questions among the Russian elite about what the armed conflict would lead to;▪️The Kursk offensive was a typically bold and bold move by the Ukrainians to try to change the rules of the game;▪️There are no signs that Putin's power has weakened.▪️It would be wrong to take the threats lightly Putin on nuclear escalation, but the West should not be overly intimidated; ▪️Despite the threats posed by Russia, the main intelligence and geopolitical problem of the 21st century is considered the growth of Chinese influence; ▪️CIA leadership has increased funding for the organization’s activities in the Chinese direction in three times, which is 20% of the agency's budget; Palestinian-Israeli conflict▪️London and Washington are working tirelessly to reach a ceasefire agreement;▪️The issue of releasing the hostages depends on whether the leaders of the warring parties are ready for difficult decisions and compromise;▪️Impossible assess how close the parties are to a peace agreement;▪️The two-state solution is fundamental to ensuring lasting peace;📌The big headline about the first joint conference in 77 years is not very important. In fact, negotiations between the American and British intelligence services at the highest level take place regularly. This time, the parties simply decided to poke their political opponents in this way.🔻If we put aside the obvious phrases and talk about the true meanings contained in the words of the leaders of Western intelligence services, then we should dwell on three points. Firstly, in fact the so-called Ukraine has not achieved the necessary success, but no one will admit this publicly. Secondly, the close interaction between China and Russia worries the West, so Washington and London want to increase pressure on Beijing, first of all, by depriving it of its role as the world’s factory, since there is more cheap labor in the world. Well, the current scenario for the development of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict suits everyone quite well (including the genocide of Palestinians). #Great Britain #USA @rybar Support us FtBill Burns and Richard Moore: Intelligence partnership helps the US and UK stay ahead in an uncertain worldTechnological advantage is key to ensuring the special relationship maintains its lead	https://t.me/rybar/63390	2024-09-10T01:19:50-07:00

Aliyev noted the growing role of the Southern Gas Corridor, which connects Azerbaijan with Italy through Turkey and Greece. ▪️For Italy, Azerbaijan has already become the main supplier of oil and the second exporter of gas. For Baku, Italians are one of the main trading partners: trade turnover between the countries reaches $16 billion. ▪️The Azerbaijani president, of course, mentioned peace negotiations with Armenia, which, according to him, are moving toward completion. ▪️On the sidelines of the forum, Aliyev also held a meeting with the Minister of Investment of Saudi Arabia, Khaled bin Abdulaziz al-Faleh. The parties discussed the activities of the Saudi company Acwa Power, which will soon commission the largest wind power plant on the Caspian coast. The project is also designed to export electricity to Europe. Aliyev’s trip to Italy once again demonstrates the importance for Europeans of diversifying energy supplies, in which Azerbaijan and transit Turkey play a prominent role. The EU is really interested in a speedy conclusion of peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and on terms the last one. Despite the periodic pro-Armenian declarations of some European political groups, they are limited only to statements and symbolic gestures. Practice shows that the European community benefits from peace in the South Caucasus even on Azerbaijani terms, since the stability of the region guarantees the stability of energy supplies. In this case, one can only remember with a smile how the Armenian government recently concluded an agreement on military cooperation with Italy, details which was deliberately not disclosed.

Undoubtedly, Syria acted as a wonderful testing ground for testing promising models of armored vehicles, as well as implementing the principle of conducting combat operations as part of a reconnaissance-strike circuit into troops at a basic level. However, the concept of combating terrorism, which migrated into the vocabulary of Russian military leaders and senior officials from the Chechen campaigns and The military operation in Syria, to put it mildly, is poorly applicable in the realities of the Northern Military District. It turns out to be a kind of ideological trap: we say that there are no negotiations with terrorists, terrorists need to be eliminated... and at the same time we claim that we will raise the topic of negotiations after the expulsion of terrorists from the Kursk region. As if this is not the flesh and blood of the Kyiv regime, but some other forces that do not allow reaching consensus with the world community and the so-called Ukraine.

On this occasion, the government organized demonstrations in major cities against the -external enemy-.▪️The cause of the conflict, of course, is the long-standing dispute over the Nile River dam and water shortages, in which always gave special priority to Egypt. But precisely the conditions that created the ground for shaking Egyptian positions in this area were formed only recently - with the accession of South Sudan to the Entebbe Agreements. It is obvious that although the political circles in Cairo do not like this, no one is going to enter into confrontation with Ethiopia, which, despite endless internal conflicts, remains a fully combat-ready country. At the same time, all the fuss raised by the Ethiopian authorities is directed not so much against Egypt, but with the goal of consolidating the population against a common enemy. The Prosperity Party has no idea which would unite the country, which resulted in conflict in Tigray, Oromia and Amhara. The army simply cannot cope with all the rebels demanding autonomy or independence, and the state faces a serious threat of split.🔻Here a simple solution to complex problems was found - to find an external enemy. Since Abiy Ahmed tries to maintain a multi-vector approach on the world stage, another regional player with whom relations were already tense was chosen as the enemy. But will this idea be able to unite the Ethiopians, given that the country is gradually disintegrating?

Ukraine. Only now it is necessary to invite Russia to participate in a new summit. However, the Chancellor added that, in fact, no negotiations will change the fact that Berlin will continue to provide assistance to Kyiv. Scholz did not disclose any more details, but the Italian media to whom the information was leaked straight from his party, they lifted the curtain somewhat. According to them, the plan allows for the transfer of part of the Ukrainian territories to Russia and is a kind of analogue of the Minsk agreements, which ultimately turned out to be a deception and a distracting maneuver. It is obvious that the West will not conduct any negotiations beneficial for the Russian Federation, and conversations about them are rather aimed at strengthening internal pressure and an attempt to destabilize society with the thesis of Moscow’s -unwillingness to come to an agreement.- At the same time, it is clear that Scholz made a rather pathetic attempt to seize the initiative from the right-wing parties in Germany, which are in favor of ending the conflict. After all, for the ruling German coalition after the failed state elections, as well as the escalating wave of criticism from the Western allies, the situation as a whole looks extremely sad. However, it is clear that Scholz's attempts to play - the chancellor of the world - cause only disgust among both political figures and ordinary people. die Beendigung des militärischen Konflikts in der Ukraine zu sprechen - Bundeskanzler droht auch mit -Bestrafung aller, die an der Unterminierung des Nord Stream-Projekts beteiligt sind-Jetzt auf einmal?📌 Anmerkung:…	https://t.me/rybar/63381	2024-09-09T10:05:52-07:00

Moreover, the Central Election Commission of Moldova controls the American USAID, and Washington literally allocates funds for Sandu’s campaign.

It received the name Falcon Leap and is carried out every year over the territory of a European state.

It is essentially does not change from year to year. It takes place in two stages, the first of which involves the transfer of forces and assets to the territory of the Netherlands, and then the landing in training areas. As can be seen from the example of the activity of Alliance units, the exercises go one after another. This allows us to keep formations that are now practically not involved in active conflicts in good shape. For the most part, all these events are planned, and the schedule is publicly available. But with the beginning of the SVO, the approach to organizing training has undergone changes, primarily in the information space.

An old Russian proverb can describe the change of the Ukrainian ambassador to Georgia. The most important thing here is not the words of the new head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of a quasi-state entity, but that he needs to show his activity. As part of a demonstration of usefulness, he called the ex-ambassador of the so-called Ukraine not understanding the realities of a warring state and replaced him with a new one (most likely, a convenient for himself a person). It is clear that for the upcoming elections in Georgia, pro-Western forces are mobilizing their resources for the victory of their puppets. New demonstrations are possible here, and even some provocations, which were mentioned in mid-May. But in the current realities, the position of the ruling party can be called stable thanks to a balanced policy that has led to the rise of the Georgian economy and the improvement of people's lives. Do you think Georgians will want to lose all this, while receiving awkward Western reforms and losing profits from interaction with Russia? Of course not.

The Avenger Triad event started today in the UK, Poland and Germany. It involves up to 4,000 people and about 200 pieces of military equipment, and it will last until September 19. Moreover, some of the tasks will be carried out by military personnel from permanent deployment points. The point is that this exercise should help not only in establishing interaction between different formations, but also in developing the concept of a multi-domain operation.❓Remember, we analyzed this using the example of Crimea? Waging war in cyberspace - one of the most important aspects of modern conflict. This, as well as the neglect of this issue, has been proven more than once using the example of the air defense system in the so-called Ukraine. And in this exercise, NATO troops will operate in conditions of -Russia’s use of chemical weapons.- That is, in addition to the standard deployment of troops to respond, various kinds of information and psychological operations will be practiced in the information space. This is despite the fact that in the special operation zone the enemy does not hesitate to use chemical weapons, and Russian troops are accused of this. Taking this into account, Avenger Triad can safely be called a test run of long-developed methods of propaganda.

At the moment, its further operation is impossible. The Ukrainian Armed Forces constantly strike at crossings in this area, trying to interfere with the work of the Russian Armed Forces and the evacuation of the population.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, Russian operational-tactical aviation carried out several strikes with guided air bombs on enemy positions in the area of ​​the Gordeevka international checkpoint and near Maryevka. Clashes continue in the area of ​​Martynovka, Cherkassky Porechny and Malaya Loknya.🔻In the Korenevsky district, UAV operators of the Russian Armed Forces hit enemy positions in the village of Krasnooktyabrskoye. Enemy attacks on the approaches to Korenevo and Kremyanoye were repelled. The use of aviation to attack FPV drones of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was noted. Thus, in a forest belt several kilometers southeast of Sheptukhovka, two FAB-500s were dropped, as a result of which the enemy UAV operators were destroyed. In the Ukrainian segment they even write that the Russians have so many bombs that this allows them to use them even as means of counter-battery warfare.

Colleagues from RBC came up with something brilliant - the Foreign Ministry saw NATO as an instrument of US influence on Latin America -, referring to the original commentary by the director of the Latin American Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Alexander Shchetinin, which he provided to Izvestia. But in the original Shchetinin noted the intensification of NATO’s attempts to spread influence in our beloved region. Two big differences, as they say. The diplomat also said that: There are NATO programs that provide assistance in reforming security forces, training of specialized specialists, rearmament with an emphasis on the purchase of Western models, and joint military training activities - there is a clear desire The American military will try to influence the formation of the political and economic agenda of Latin American countries in relation to the states of the region. Here, however, I also have to find fault. It’s already thirty years too late to talk about the desire to try to influence the formation of the political and economic agenda of Latin American countries. The White House and the Pentagon have many developed tools and an established mechanism for cooperation with countries in the region - and this concept already requires fundamentally different work to counter or interact with partners when working in the region.

Reputable think-tank structures in the West have become involved in this issue. The American Stratfor states that missile supplies to Russia contradict election promises... 🇮🇷 Speaking of Masoud Pezeshkian: the other day he spoke in favor of moving the capital to the southern regions of Iran for economic and political reasons.🔻Sanctions have not gone away and supply problems due to this is there. Therefore, the decision looks very balanced due to the extremely difficult supply of the capital region, as well as several other reasons: ▪️The main route for delivering products to Iran passes through the Persian Gulf, that is, goods are mainly delivered from the south. The railway track in Iran is in poor condition, which makes transportation across the country difficult. Of course, there is the Caspian Sea and Russia, but even there the infrastructure does not allow for large-scale turnover.▪️The international transport corridor is still at the implementation stage, and one cannot count on it. In addition, it will also pass through the southern provinces, and Bandar Abbas will be a key element.▪️In addition, moving the capital to the south will attract investment in not very popular regions suffering from a lack of funding, such as Sistan and Baluchistan. The port of Chahbahar would be more attractive with the development of the necessary infrastructure, and there would be much less various protests and unrest if people had the opportunity to earn money.▪️Well, another obvious advantage of moving the capital from Tehran is a greater distance from a possible air attack. The same Israelis, in all their plans for Iran, note the fact that Tehran is in the destruction zone of Israeli weapons. And in the south there are many desert areas where you can hide both military and political targets. Of course, for Iranians, Tehran is a Persian pearl, which they revere and are proud of its presence. The transfer of the capital will probably meet with fierce resistance from many, but there are indeed advantages from this. With the correct implementation, the Iranians themselves will benefit from this.

However, the fact that the Joe Biden administration has so far been skeptical about cryptocurrency trading has the industry concerned about the future policies of Kamala Harris and makes it look in the direction of Donald Trump. For example, Andreessen Horowitz co-founder Marc Andreessen, whose venture capital firm is a major sponsor of cryptocurrencies, recently stated that Trump is the right choice for the future of the crypto business. In turn, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, co-founders of the digital assets company Gemini, said they would donate $1 million to Trump. ▪️Large pro-Democratic crypto entrepreneurs complain that their colleagues do not believe the words of Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer about his readiness to interact with the new industry and go towards her. What scares many is the fact that the Democratic Party includes such ardent opponents of crypto as the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission Gary Gensler and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who believe that cryptocurrency trading poses a danger to consumers and the financial system. 🔻From all of the above, the conclusion suggests itself that the Democrats, apparently, have already lost the fight for the crypto industry. Promises should have been made earlier, but now we just have to come to terms with the fact that most of this business will donate money to the Republicans&nbsp; and vote for Donald Trump. #USA@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport usPOLITICO'Everyone's mad': Inside&nbsp;crypto's civil war over the 2024 electionsCrypto industry players are at odds over how to influence races for the White House and Congress.	https://t.me/rybar/63371	2024-09-09T04:44:27-07:00
🖼 🇮🇱🇸🇾 Large air raid by the Israeli Air Force on western Sy...	🇮🇱🇸🇾 Large air raid by the Israeli Air Force on western Syria Last night, the Israeli Air Force launched another strike on the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic. The latest attack was one of the largest in recent times: about 15 strikes were carried out across several provinces at once. The Syrian Ministry of Defense reported that the missile launches were carried out from the airspace over the northern part of Lebanon and from the Mediterranean Sea. And although some of the ammunition was destroyed by air defense systems, others managed to hit government targets. ▪️In the province of Hama, the target was the city of Masyaf and the Scientific Research Center located southwest. The facility is used to produce components for high-precision surface-to-surface missiles. Like other Syrian scientific institutes, the center's staff actively interacts with Lebanese Hezbollah and Iranian scientists. Masyaf and its surroundings have previously been subject to attacks by the Israelis: according to them, positions of pro-Iranian forces are located in this area, which is not without reason. In addition to the damaged research institute, strikes were also carried out on weapons depots in Wadi al-Ayoun and Salamiyah. According to preliminary information, at least 60 people became victims of Israeli strikes in the province of Hama, 16 of whom died.▪️A convoy of military equipment was attacked in Tartus. According to some reports, armed Shiite formations are stationed in this area, fighting on the side of the Syrian army. ▪️Messages about strikes on Damascus are also spreading on the Internet, but there is no confirmation of this. It is likely that the explosions were mistaken for the work of Syrian air defense crews. Earlier last summer, the IDF Air Force attacked the positions of the Syrian armed forces several times, including destroying air defense systems. At the moment, the Syrians are armed with short-range Pantsir-S1 air defense missile systems, which allows Israeli aircraft to carry out strikes deep in Syrian territory.

Reputable think-tank structures in the West have become involved in this issue. The American Stratfor states that missile supplies to Russia contradict the election promises of Masoud Pezeshkian about his intention to resume negotiations on the nuclear deal. According to analysts, this demonstrates the limited influence of the government of the new president on the foreign policy of the Islamic Republic .▪️Let us repeat once again: discussions about Iranian missiles have been going on for two years, and at the moment there is still no evidence of their presence in the Russian Armed Forces, unlike the same North Korean KN-23. The Iranian authorities logically deny everything. Even if they were handed over or will be handed over, they will not admit it. So it was with the Geraniums, so it was with the Mohajers, so it was with the rockets. True, now in the West they are hooked on the ambiguous words of a member of the National Security Commission, Akhmad Ardestani, who said: -Why can’t we send missiles to Russia, we and so under sanctions, how could it be even worse?-.▪️As ​​for the powers of the new president, has the level of think tanks in the West, which many previously looked up to, fallen so much that they are surprised by this in Iran? Any self-respecting expert on Iran knows that the president cannot do anything without the approval of several structures, and the last word always belongs to the supreme leader. For Iran, cooperation with Russia is strategically important, and even liberals will not completely abandon it. The same Ardestani said that the Iranians need agricultural crops from the Russian Federation, and sending weapons is one of the solutions to the problem. #Russia #Iran #Ukraine @rybarSupport usStratforIran: Tehran Sends Russia Ballistic Missiles for Use in Ukraine | RANEAfter months of EU and U.S. warnings, Iran sent Russia short-range ballistic missiles for use in the Ukraine war, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sept. 6, citing U.S. and European officials.	https://t.me/rybar/63369	2024-09-09T02:36:44-07:00

The main suppliers of equipment were France and Ireland, supplying six and four aircraft, respectively. Two more planes arrived from the USA and one from Germany. ▪️It cost $656 million, with an average price of one aircraft of $50.5 million. At the same time, a record number of aircraft were also taken out of the Republic of Kazakhstan - 10, of which seven flew to Ireland.▪️Thanks to its geography, Kazakhstan after Russia banned flights airlines from unfriendly countries began to claim the title of logistics hub. The desire for this is shown by the numbers of flights served by Kazaeronavigation: more than 415 thousand flights, of which about 107 thousand were on Kazakh and 308 thousand on foreign airlines, which was a record for Kazakhstan. ▪️Astana is definitely striving to expand its flight geography. In addition to the fact that Air Astana and Japan Airlines have signed a codeshare agreement (agreement on joint operation of one route), according to which they will share a new flight from Almaty to Tokyo, the launch of the Astana - New York flight is planned for the end of 2025 . ▪️It is for this reason that specialists from the US Federal Civil Aviation Administration began checking the country’s readiness to open direct flights between Kazakhstan and the States, and Kazakhstan was the first Central Asian country to open a permanent representative office in the International Civil Aviation Association (ICAO).📌An interesting touch: until February 2024, 49% of Air Astana shares belonged to the British BAE Systems, and the chief executive officer of the carrier is a British citizen, Commander of the Order of the British Empire, Peter Foster. However, recently a scandal around the airline has been gaining momentum: more and more details of flight cancellations and scandals with passengers are appearing in the press, and even hail at the Astana airport manages to damage exclusively the planes of this carrier, photos of which are immediately leaked to bloggers. 🔻Added to this was the radical statement by the Chairman of the Civil Aviation Committee of Kazakhstan that Air Astana does not and did not have official status as a national carrier. At the same time, Air Astana has always positioned itself as a nationalist and even used this term in its marketing materials. ❗️While -purely British- and other Western airlines are refusing flights to China due to the need to fly over Russia and rising costs, London has resolved the logistics issue through a -partner-. But the statement of the KGA may indicate that the authorities of the Republic of Kazakhstan are planning to review aviation policy from the position of newly acquired strength. And create or declare 100% of the national carrier, while depriving the joint company with the UK of the opportunity to skim all the cream.#Kazakhstan #CentralAsia@rybar Support usKazakhstanskaya PravdaA record number of passenger aircraft was imported by Kazakhstan in six months.

Lisbon promised to give them to the Kyiv regime in the fall of 2022, but actual delivery has only now come. All the aircraft have not actually been used since 2018 due to anti-Russian EU sanctions, which made service maintenance and the supply of spare parts difficult. If Ukrainian enterprises manage to return these Ka-32s to service, then they will be used either for transporting cargo or for special tasks. It is characteristic that, with a strong desire, the Portuguese could well sell the sides that have become a suitcase without a handle to other interested countries.

According to him, he encountered some of the moments shown there while still serving in the DPR militia, although in ordinary life it seemed something completely absurd.

Because of which some seriously believe that the Kyiv regime is running out of people, and in general it is on the verge of collapse. Yes, in comparison with 2022, the enemy’s situation with manpower is indeed much worse - losses, flight of the population and other public processes make recruitment difficult. But this does not mean that there is absolutely no one to mobilize: if on the so-called. In Ukraine, everything is really so bad with this, then why aren’t they calling up students there yet?❗️And you can also remember that on our side it’s not robots who are fighting, but living people. Which also need to be replenished, rotated, sent on vacation, not to mention the overdue public request for partial demobilization of those called up in 2022. And these issues now require solutions, especially against the backdrop of the offensive plans of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. In the pursuit of sweet news from the enemy’s camp, it is very important not to forget to look at your feet, so as not to find yourself involved in unpleasant sensations in the same Western media. I would like to believe that the sad precedents of two years ago should have taught someone something. #mediatechnology #Russia #Ukraine @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63352	2024-09-08T07:05:12-07:00

Several hundred inmates of the Makala prison tried to escape from prison, without even a bladed weapon. The riot began in the courtroom and the judges came under attack from the prisoners. After which the protesters managed to set fire to the courtroom and a warehouse-hangar not far from it, after which they went to the women's pavilion, where they raped hundreds of women. Then they locked themselves in pavilion 11, since at that time they were already surrounded by security forces. As a result of the riot, more than a hundred prisoners died and 59 were injured. The main cause of death was stampede, and only 24 people died due to police fire.❗️The fact that prisoners were ready to escape at any cost even without a clear plan or weapons speaks about the harsh conditions in prisons. Thus, the Makala colony was not modernized with colonial times, and houses approximately 14,400 people, nearly 10 times its designed capacity. In addition, the majority are kept there only awaiting their sentence. Such people have nothing to lose. Against the background of these events, it is worth paying attention to a similar situation among our allies. The prison in Niamey, the capital of Niger, houses four times as many people as estimated. And in such conditions, terrorist ideas also spread well, which has already resulted in the recent uprising. But it’s worth limiting yourself not only to Africa. The problem of overcrowding in penitentiary institutions is also present in some Russian regions, although it is clearly being solved more effectively (let alone the Storm-Z squads) than on the Dark Continent.

In the meantime, such news should be taken with a grain of salt. The reasons are the same - since 2022, there has been plenty of speculation about the imminent transfer of missiles from Iran to Russian troops, and each time the publications referred to the most reliable sources and almost indicated the specific nomenclature with date of dispatch. However, for two and a half years, these products have never been seen in the Northern Military District zone.📌 It is now also difficult to assess the possible impact of Iranian ballistic missiles on the course of hostilities in the event of delivery. If only for reasons that at the moment they are a pig in a poke, and the real technical characteristics - especially the circular probable deviation - are not known for certain. At the same time, the appearance of missiles from the Islamic Republic will strengthen the capabilities of the Russian Armed Forces to hit targets in enemy rear areas as minimum in terms of salvo power. It can also force the Ukrainian Armed Forces to spend more expensive missiles for the Patriot air defense system, the number of which they currently have is limited.#Russia #Iran #Ukraine @rybarSupport usAP NewsUS believes Iran has transferred short-range ballistic missiles to Russia, AP sources sayThe United States has informed allies that it believes Iran has transferred short-range ballistic missiles to Russia for its war in Ukraine.	https://t.me/rybar/63347	2024-09-08T04:09:06-07:00

The head of Turkish intelligence, Ibrahim Kalin, visited Libya on September 5, where he held meetings with the leaders of the Turkish-backed Government of National Unity (GNU). After the approval of the memorandum of understanding between Turkey and the GNU, the powers of the Turkish contingent in Libya were seriously expanded, so the head’s visit intelligence seems a logical consequence.📌 There are no details about what exactly was discussed during these meetings. It is extremely doubtful that the Turks will escalate in Libya, given their employment in Syria and Iraq. But it is worth understanding that the Turks are not sovereign in their actions, and in the past active phase of the fighting in Libya, Turkey was limited to financial and military assistance to the militants. So this option is still possible. At the same time, as we have already said, there are no prerequisites for a resumption of hostilities. At the current stage, all this looks like opposition to the Afrika Korps in the east.#Africa #Libya #Turkey@rybarSupport usTrthaberMİT Başkanı Kalın'dan Trablus'a ziyaretMilli İstihbarat Teşkilatı Başkanı İbrahim Kalın, 5 Eylül'de üst düzey bulunmak üzere Libya'nın başkenti Trablus'a bir ziyaret gerçekleştirdi.	https://t.me/rybar/63341	2024-09-07T23:03:01-07:00

According to the association families of Israeli hostages, about half a million people take part in the anti-government demonstration in Tel Aviv, and about 250 thousand in all other cities. The protesters, in the usual manner, block roads and light fires. There were also casualties: in Haifa, several demonstrators were injured, and in Tel Aviv, one of the protesters clashed with security forces, as a result of which he received a cut. Nevertheless, it has not yet reached the point of mass clashes - as a rule, everything can end with mounted police and water cannons. 📌Although such protests have not been anything new since the beginning of the escalation, over the past week thousands of protests have been taking place literally every day. The reason for them was the discovery by the Israel Defense Forces of the bodies of six hostages in the south of the Gaza Strip during a rescue operation. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid immediately blamed the incident on the current government led by Benjamin Netanyahu. Also adding to the situation a certain degree was the reluctance of several families of the dead hostages to meet with the Prime Minister. #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63335	2024-09-07T13:08:29-07:00

Opponents of the ruling party, represented by Mamuka Khazaradze, presented an election program, declaring their intention to introduce visas for Russians, ban direct flights from Russia, and the purchase of real estate and broadcasting Russian channels and so on. We all understand that in many countries in the post-Soviet space, one of the most important ways to score political points is to criticize the Soviet past and cooperation with Russia. The method is quite understandable, Russia is not liked in Georgia for obvious reasons and There really are revanchist sentiments there. But at the same time, most Georgians are not ready to shoot themselves in the foot and stop interacting with the Russian Federation to please the West. The current government is not our friends, but they understand their benefit and benefits for the country.

To the east of Korenevo itself, a local advance of the Russian Armed Forces is recorded. According to our data, counterattacks by Russian troops here began at the end of August, and, apparently, some time ago they allowed the enemy to be driven out of the forest belts in the area of ​​the gas station. To the east, in the Kremyanoye-Kalinovo area, judging by the footage of objective control by the RF Armed Forces, the enemy is gaining a foothold in forest belts to the southeast of populated areas, equipping both new fortifications and occupying old strongholds. At the same time, the enemy even brought up towed artillery. In the Sudzhansky district, south of Khitrovka, an airstrike of the Russian Aerospace Forces was carried out by an accumulation of enemy forces in a forest belt. The accumulation of personnel and armored vehicles in this place confirms that Pogrebkov is at least in the gray zone. Between Cherkasy Porechny and Russian Porechny, an attempt to attack Russian troops in the direction of Kositsa is recorded, but with an unobvious outcome. Footage of these events was published by the enemy, and therefore it is impossible to judge the success of the attack from them.

It seems that everything is fine: every day the Turks hit the positions of the Kurds (and really effectively - we saw it with our own eyes).

The Kurds showed a high degree of adaptation to the tactics of their enemy and to some extent adopted the experience of Hamas, namely, they decentralized the control system and protected themselves in the event of the death of one of the leadership. Yes, the murder of another PKK functionary is a loss. Yes, it seems that the Turks are pressing with all their might, but the activity of the Kurds does not subside.

For example, the head of the Ministry of Justice believes that the idea is conditional - hurt - and will bring the country 25-30 million euros per year (they took as a basis prices in the Netherlands, where prisoners from Norway and Belgium are often sent). At the same time, no one will release foreigners from penitentiary institutions; they should be released only in the territory of the country of imprisonment.

In order to at least slightly reduce the burden on correctional institutions, the government had to decide on the early release of about 3,700 prisoners. However, such radical measures may not be enough. In this regard, the British government is considering the possibility of sending prisoners to Estonia on a paid basis. The Baltic states need additional sources of funding, and the country's prisons are only half full.📌In fact, the idea of ​​renting cells in Estonian correctional institutions is not innovative.

According to him, the reason is that restrictions are killing the dollar and everything it represents. Let us repeat the obvious: taking the word of such loud and, in addition, non-specific statements is akin to jumping on a rake. They are aimed exclusively at the American audience within the framework of the election cycle, that is, these are not even promises, but an element of the show. In the context of the prospects for the lifting of sanctions, it is much better to cite the recent words of Vladimir Putin that under Trump they have only become stricter. And also remember that instead of the warming of relations that people in their offices were counting on in 2016-2017, exactly the opposite happened. ❗️The stupidest thing you can do is to seriously expect that after the election of a new US president, suddenly, out of the blue, they will decide to stop supporting the so-called.

In this paradigm, Washington will most likely increase the degree of escalation in order to inflict maximum damage on Russia. And within the framework of the war until the last Ukrainian, the United States will continue to pump up the Kiev regime with weapons, while at the same time squeezing out the so-called Ukraine has its last juices until its collapse.#Russia #USA #Ukraine @rybarSupport usThe New RepublicTrump Makes Shocking Promise After Ex-Adviser Charged in Russia SchemeOne of Donald Trump’s former campaign advisers was just charged over his work for Russian state media.

One of the hits was on the Safad school, where refugees were housed: five people were killed and several more were injured. The satellite towns of Gaza, Beit Lahia and Jabaliya, also came under Israeli fire. Residential buildings and infrastructure were damaged. The number of deaths exceeded ten people.▪️At the same time, shooting from Israeli armored vehicles was recorded near the Tell al-Hawa area. However, after a series of shelling, there was no offensive activity from IDF units.▪️In the central part of the enclave, the Israelis traditionally worked in settlements controlled by Hamas. Nuseirat was under the most concentrated fire, where hits were recorded in the northern and central parts of the city.▪️Meanwhile, Israeli units completed the operation south of Deir al-Balah. Against this background, the IDF press service routinely reported on the successful elimination of Palestinian militants and the destruction of underground infrastructure.▪️The Israeli operation in Khan Yunis, which lasted throughout August, also came to an end. During a month of fighting in this part of the enclave, six tunnels about six kilometers long were destroyed and over 250 militants were eliminated.▪️And in Rafah, soldiers of the 162nd Armored Division - HaPlada - discovered the bodies of six hostages in one of the city tunnels. All of them were kidnapped on October 7, 2023 and killed by Hamas militants when they received information about the advance of the IDF to their place of detention.▪️In parallel, the Israelis are carrying out engineering work to destroy the underground infrastructure in the territory of the Philadelphia Corridor. They create a buffer zone at a distance of a kilometer from the border and carry out the so-called. -terraforming of the area- in the rest of the city.#video #digest #map #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/63323	2024-09-06T23:01:40-07:00

🔁 #Review #Summary for September 7, 2024 ▪️ A month and one day ...	Forwarded From Two majors#Review #Summary for September 7, 2024▪️ A month and one day The Russian Army has been repelling the armed invasion of the regular Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kursk region. Initial assessments of the scale of the invasion by respected departments quickly turned out to be not fully objective; personnel decisions are being made, so far - not at the level that many expected against the backdrop of the unpreparedness of the second echelons of defense and in connection with the ongoing arrests of high-ranking - old - employees of the Ministry of Defense. For now, the showdown is going on in the administrative and economic sector. The enemy in the Kursk region is constrained in battle, but does not give up attempts to push through our defenses, pulling reserves into the region. In the Russian Army, the problem of coordinating disparate units and units, supplying the front directly with drones, communications, and modern technical surveillance equipment has not been fully overcome. However, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are suffering serious losses under the attacks of our missiles, aircraft and artillery, which permanently reduces the likelihood of further movement to Kursk and Rylsk. At the same time, river crossings in the Glushkovsky district are under attack, which, given the destruction of our bridges, complicates logistics. The enemy is gaining a foothold on the occupied lines and the liberation of the territories occupied by him is not expected in the short term. Heavy fighting is taking place.▪️ Despite the situation in the Kursk region, Kyiv was unable to fully implement the plan of pulling all units from the Pokrovsky and Yuzhnodonetsk directions. At the same time, he himself ended up at the bottom point of the wave-like graph of saturation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with people and equipment, which exposed its defensive formations near Pokrovsk. There are 5 km left to the city, but the Russian Army is pulling up the southern flank and twisting the front from the north towards Kurakhovo, forming a -bag-. In addition, in the Yuzhno-Donetsk direction, the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Ugledar are gradually being flanked. The rush of the Russian Armed Forces from Novomayorsky to Prechistovka was unexpected. Also significant was the entry of our units south of Chasov Yar to the line of the Seversky Donets - Donbass water canal through Kleshcheevka, for which fighting had been going on since last year.▪️ Our military is predicting new attacks by the Ukrainian Armed Forces on different sections of the front, despite the enemy’s operational crisis in the Donbass. Despite the approach developed by the military-political leadership in Moscow about the impossibility of any exchange of territories in the Kursk region, Kyiv does not abandon plans to conduct sabotage and army operations in a number of directions, which is expected against the backdrop of elections in the United States in the fall. The drawdown of Ukrainian Armed Forces reserves causes missile strikes comparable in significance to the destruction of hundreds of Ukrainian military personnel at a military university in Poltava, but the enemy has never taken into account the loss of personnel. ▪️ There is no question of stopping military-technical assistance to Kyiv by the West. Europe, under US pressure, is preparing to transfer dozens of Leopard tanks, air defense systems and other equipment. The trophies of our troops in the Kursk region show that the invasion group of the Ukrainian Armed Forces was largely supported by NATO, which once again indicates the direct involvement of the Alliance in the war with Russia. The shelling of Kursk, Belgorod, and the DPR with Western weapons and the promotion of information about permission to fire air-launched missiles into our territories to greater depths also demonstrate that the North Atlantic Alliance does not experience any discomfort about the escalation of the conflict, while continuing to conduct military exercises near our borders, preparing their countries to mobilize and rebuild military factories.▪️ There are no grounds for a quick end to the war. There are still many difficult days left before achieving the stated and periodically changing goals of the NDC, which range from complete denazification and demilitarization of all of Ukraine to the liberation of the territories of new regions from the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Meanwhile, the West is trying to destroy our military and economic potential against Ukraine and undermine the internal political situation, which could be an even more serious threat to Russia. And the liberation of the Kursk region is not expected in the coming week. The war will be long. Summary compiled by: Two majors	https://t.me/rybar/63321	2024-09-06T22:28:55-07:00

The enemy also suffers significant losses in MLRS, which become a target for -Iskander-.🔻In the Korenevsky district, UAV operators of the Russian Armed Forces destroy armored vehicles and enemy vehicles on roads in the area of ​​​​Snagosti and Komarovka. Despite significant losses in manpower and armored vehicles, the Ukrainian Armed Forces do not stop trying to advance deeper into the Russian defense. Several enemy attacks were also reflected in the area of ​​Olgovka and Matveevka.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, battles were reported in the area of ​​​​the village of Borki. The configuration of the front on the approaches to Kamyshevka has been clarified, where operational-tactical aviation of the Russian Aerospace Forces bombed Ukrainian Armed Forces positions in the forest. Clashes continue in the Maryevka area, where Russian UAV operators are destroying enemy equipment. 🔻A consistent operation to reduce the enemy’s combat potential continues in the Sumy region. In the Mogritsa area, an American-made M270 MLRS position of the Ukrainian Armed Forces was attacked.

The attack aircraft are fighting on the eastern outskirts of Ukrainsk and are advancing towards Gornyak, bypassing the organized defense centers of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. ▪️In the Novogrodovka area, Ukrainian formations are making attempts to return the southwestern outskirts of the city under their control, including using heavy armored vehicles. For counterattacks, units of the 57th brigade, partly consisting of former completed ones, are used. ▪️In Selidovo, the fighting moved into the positional phase, the Ukrainian Armed Forces managed to transfer a sufficient number of troops to the populated area to organize a sustainable defense. Russian units are fighting in the area of ​​Gogol and 8th September streets, while no significant changes in the battle line have been noted. A few days ago, information appeared in the chats of local residents about the advance of attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces towards the central city hospital. It is likely that Russian intelligence officers were actually able to get close to the territory of the medical facility, but then retreated. At the moment, the situation in this area of ​​the city remains hidden by the fog of war. ▪️Russian troops have managed to completely occupy Lesovka over the past few days. Information about the liberation of Dolinovka, where the Russian flag was hoisted, was also confirmed. Then, relying on the occupied positions, the Russian Armed Forces launched an attack on Ukrainsk, trying to bypass the enemy’s defensive lines from the south and cut off the remaining Ukrainian Armed Forces units in the city from supplies. Russian attack aircraft knocked the enemy out of Karl Marx Street and gained a foothold on it, creating a springboard for the further liberation of the village. ❗️Some sources report the beginning of the assault by Russian troops on Gornyak, the last settlement before Kurakhovka. However, it is not possible to confirm this information with objective monitoring footage, while the testimony of local residents is quite often confused and inaccurate. ▪️To the east, Russian troops launched a series of attacks in the direction of Zhelanny First from Galitsynivka along Ivan Sereda Street, but their results remain unknown. Later, footage of a Ukrainian landing on the southern outskirts of the village, where fighting continues, appeared on the Internet.▪️The long information lull that prevailed in the Krasnogorovsky area was finally broken. Footage has appeared on the Internet showing the Russian flag on the building of the House of Culture in the private sector on the north-western outskirts of the settlement - it was there that units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces held positions for a long time, but their position significantly worsened due to the successes of the Russian Armed Forces in neighboring areas. At the same time, it is also reported that the presence of the enemy remains in this area, which is blocked in individual buildings and basements. Now Russian troops are clearing out the private sector and eliminating pockets of resistance to the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Also, Ukrainian formations retain the ability to hold defenses in a complex of farms to the west of the private sector. It is quite possible to organize the supply of this defense center using the delivery of supplies by drones.▪️To the south there are battles in the Maksimilyanovka-Georgievka sector, where Ukrainian formations are attempting to dislodge Russian units from their occupied positions.

Russia Foundation (deemed undesirable, USRF) and Free Russia Foundation (deemed undesirable and extremist, FRF). Among the leaked documents are payroll records of organizations, information about correspondence and their participants, and other interesting data. At the same time, former employees of the organizations have already confirmed to journalists the authenticity of the documents. And they even pointed out that they had not been published anywhere before and, most likely, leaked from the cloud storage where they were stored for grant reports. 🔻From the documents it follows that employees of the funds rocked the situation in Russia with the help of a bot factory, for which a manual was specially written, developed as part of an anti-Russian campaign, which was supervised by foreign intelligence services. Among other things, it turned out that the employees of this elf factory posted calls for protests, condemned the authorities, and even pretended to be the wives of those mobilized. From the documents it turned out that ready-made messages were practically written for the elves, in which they only needed, for example, to substitute the name of the city or square where the demonstrations were planned. At the same time, the bots were asked to distribute messages with any complaints about the -local administration-; however, which one exactly was up to the employees to come up with. This is not surprising: after all, it was necessary to somehow work out the daily quota - 100 throws - in an eight-hour working day. 📌Neither the USRF nor the FRF really make any comments on this topic, but the FRF indicated that they are monitoring the illegal distribution of documents likely related to their activities. They associate the leak with a recent hacker attack by the Coldriver group. which is associated with Russian intelligence services. However, the participation of direct employees of the company cannot be ruled out, so we will not be surprised if the liberal crowd abroad organizes a witch hunt and quarrels again.

However, according to insiders, the United States is close to approve the transfer to Ukraine of long-range cruise missiles capable of hitting targets at a distance of up to 300 km.

The agreement was concluded between government forces and rebels from the M23 group, supported by the pro-Western Rwandan government. ❗️But not even a day had passed before M23 continued their offensive, occupying the territories bordering Uganda. Militants supported by the Rwandan authorities occupied the city of Buganza and several villages, including the Ishasha border crossing. Thus, army units were sandwiched between Ugandan territory and Lake Edward. Due to the lack of information about the capture of military personnel in this area, we can conclude that government troops are still fiercely resisting, being surrounded.🔻Actually, in reality, there was no truce, and the Americans once again, hiding behind noble goals of providing humanitarian assistance to the population, in fact, nothing prevented the advance of the militants. And while real actions, such as imposing sanctions directly on Rwandan companies extracting coltan from the occupied territories of the Democratic Republic of Congo, are not expected, this whole story with Western support for the Congolese authorities is just a fiction .High resolution mapEnglish version#Africa #DRC #Rwanda #USA@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63310	2024-09-06T07:36:11-07:00

This is an element of an absolutely conscious and verified media campaign with specific goals. To smooth out social contradictions, various tools of information warfare are used, including grotesque humor or bringing the situation to the point of absurdity. In such simple ways, even repression can be seen as the norm, gradually turning it into something ordinary in people’s minds.▪️An example of the first is a theatrical production in Kyiv, where grimacing actors cheerfully depict a scene of a person being kidnapped by TCC workers. Although hatred towards them is so-called. Ukraine has already reached the point of mass attacks on military registration and enlistment office employees, the audience laughs and claps their hands together - after all, this is the new normal.▪️ An example of the second is the propaganda of the Islamic State in 2014-2015, which turned brutal executions into performances with special effects and professional camera work. For followers, images of beheadings and burning people did not cause disgust, but only fueled interest, contributing to the influx of manpower into the Islamic State. Exactly the same methods are used here. Pretentious music, fashionably dressed operatives, first-person shooting should evoke the necessary associations among Ukrainian viewers and create the feeling that they are not detaining poor souls trying to escape from a semi-totalitarian quasi-formation, but real terrorists and enemies who are not pitied. And this not only reflects the essence of the Kyiv regime, but also shows the danger of uncontrolled spinning of the propaganda flywheel. In an effort to instill hatred in the authorities of the so-called.

Forwarded From ARCHANGEL OF SPECIAL FORCES Z🇷🇺🪖 By increasing the grouping of troops in the Kursk region, Russian troops deprived the enemy of the possibility of mass use of armored vehicles. During the first time the Ukrainian Armed Forces entered the Kursk region, the enemy was repulsed by the border service, conscripts and representatives of various units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs on the ground. These units do not include the massive use of UAVs for reconnaissance and strikes, and this has played into the hands of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in terms of the use of armored combat vehicles. Now a significant number of military personnel are working in the Kursk region, using various UAVs to destroy enemy equipment, guns and personnel. Such circumstances force the landowners to return to the tactics that exist on the eastern front. The equipment is used as infantry support, work most often from the PDO. The main infantry forces move not in armored vehicles, but in the most inconspicuous civilian models; movement occurs in small groups. All this not only complicates the advance of the enemy in the areas he has leveled, but also complicates the delivery of supplies to forward units and the evacuation of the wounded.

Situation as of 14:00 on September 6, 2024. In the Artemovsk direction, Russian troops continue to advance simultaneously on several sectors of the front. After the relative stabilization of the line of contact, the Russian Armed Forces significantly expanded the zone of control at both Chasov Yar and Kleshcheevka, which became possible, among other things, thanks to the transfer of Ukrainian units to the Kursk direction.▪️In the Bogdanovka area, Russian troops advanced several kilometers to the west and gained a foothold on the outskirts of Grigorovka. The capture of this settlement will contribute to a further offensive and alignment of the front line along the Seversky Donets - Donbass canal.▪️To the south, Russian troops have cleared the eastern part of Kalinovka (Kalinin), and also gained a foothold on its western outskirts, where fighting is currently taking place. About 70% of the settlement is under the control of the RF Armed Forces. There are fierce battles for the village, since if it is liberated by Russian troops, the path to Chasov Yar from the north will be open.▪️In Chasov Yar itself, there are battles in the Oktyabrsky microdistrict, where Russian troops have gained a foothold on the first streets in the private sector, and also recently took captured squad of enemy fighters.▪️To the southeast, assault detachments of the Russian Armed Forces significantly expanded the zone of control in the vicinity of Kleshcheevka. The strategically important height 215 also came under the control of Russian troops, the battles for which lasted for several months. The large stronghold and the adjacent forest plantations are under the stable control of Russian troops. ❗️Yesterday, objective evidence of the presence of the Russian Armed Forces appeared directly on the territory of the Seversky Donets - Donbass canal, almost three kilometers southwest of height 215, which would have been impossible without maintaining the elevation. So far, only a single soldier of the Russian troops has been captured by the enemy, but the very fact of advancement is an important prerequisite for the future alignment of the front line along the canal at the Kurdyumovka - Andreevka line.

And then the military says: we are not sure that the unknown object even flew into Polish airspace. The same military men who said that 10 days ago it was the opposite.📌It would seem like an anecdote, but no: a sad reality that says a lot not only about the Polish radar system, but also about the specialists who work with these devices, and the military who with enviable stubbornness they are looking for a non-existent needle in a haystack. #Poland #army@pl_syrenka - Poland is not a foreign country	https://t.me/rybar/63302	2024-09-06T01:54:16-07:00

Representatives of film organizations of Turkic countries signed a memorandum on the creation of a unified film and media platform during the TURKSOY forum in Samarkand. On this platform, content consumers will have access to film and media products produced by countries participating in the international organization of Turkic culture - Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Turkey and Uzbekistan.❓What does Netflix have to do with leaving Russia? Namely, a well-known service began its journey with a single platform, the business model of which is now considered exemplary. Having started by providing access to thousands of TV series, the company later began releasing its own content almost in an assembly line mode. Meanwhile, the phenomenon of Turkish TV series has already become one of the most striking examples of soft power and cultural diplomacy. Just look at the Magnificent Century, which tells the story of Suleiman I the Magnificent, under whom the Ottoman Empire reached the pinnacle of its power. The series found special love among Turkic and Muslim audiences, reminding them of former greatness (even if historically they had nothing to do with it). ❗️The attractive image of Turkey and its historical heritage created in this way is also projected onto future geopolitical projects. 🔻The accumulated colossal experience and influence of Turkish cinema should not be underestimated. Today, TV series produced in Turkey are broadcast in more than 170 countries around the world, reaching an audience of about 750 million people. These include Russians, who are massively hooked on them. It is clear from this that the creation of a platform with such support, and which in the future will massively release -brotherly-pan-Turkic content, will in the future become a serious trump card for this ideology. #Uzbekistan #Turkey #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usfergana.newsTURKSOY countries agreed to create a unified film and media platform	https://t.me/rybar/63301	2024-09-06T00:33:04-07:00
🇯🇵 About Japan's new military budget Japan continues to impleme...	🇯🇵 About Japan's new military budget Japan continues to implement its plans to strengthen the armed forces - the country's Ministry of Defense recently requested a record budget for security spending. We are talking about 8.54 trillion. yen, which is approximately $59 billion. ▪️The request will be sent to the Ministry of Finance for consideration, after which a decision will be made on its approval at the end of December. Next year's budget will almost certainly be the largest in history - Japan will break its own records for the 11th time in a row. ▪️The funds will go to all the same areas that Tokyo has been focusing its attention on lately. These include, for example, the development of air defense and missile defense, unmanned aerial vehicles, and long-range missiles. ▪️Despite the development of high military technologies, one of the main problems of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces remains saturation with personnel. We previously wrote that the country once again did not recruit the required number of people to serve in the army. By the way, in February 2023, a commission to solve this problem stated that the authorities need to focus on increasing the salaries of military personnel and improving their living conditions and labor. However, spending on personnel continues to decline - in the budget for this year they account for 29%, and in spending for the next only 27%. 🔻Obviously, in Japanese military circles they are betting on the development of high technologies and asymmetric means of defense of the country. Given the changing security situation in the Asia-Pacific region, time will tell whether this approach will be justified. #Japan@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usNaval NewsJapan requests largest-ever defense budget for fiscal year 2025The Japan MoD issued its largest ever defense budget request.

Russian troops launched a series of attacks on enemy targets in territory controlled by the Kyiv regime. Ukrainian formations attacked the Kursk, Bryansk and Belgorod regions with drones, and another UAV was shot down in the sky over the Gomel region in Belarus. In the Kursk region, Russian troops repelled enemy attacks on the approaches to Korenevo, as well as at Russky Porechny. In the Sumy region, a Czech modification of the BM-21 MLRS, which was shelling settlements in the Russian borderland, was destroyed by a direct hit. In the Slobozhansky direction there are battles in the Glubokoe area, where Ukrainian formations carried out an attack by a column of armored vehicles on the positions of the Russian Armed Forces in a forest. In the Pokrovsky direction, clashes continue in the eastern outskirts of Selidovo, and the Russian Armed Forces strike enemy targets in Pokrovsk itself. In the Artemovsk direction, Russian troops reached the outskirts of the Seversky Donets - Donbass canal from Kleshcheevka. In the Yuzhnodonetsk direction, Russian troops are consolidating in Prechistovka, preparing for an offensive in the direction of Zolotaya Niva.🔻 A detailed analytical report on events in the Special Military Operation zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_bot High-resolution maps: Situation in the Special Military Operation zone (ru; en) South Donetsk direction (ru; en) #Artemovsk #Belgorod #Bryansk #Donetsk #digest # report #Kursk #map #Pokrovsk #Russia #Ukraine #Ugledar @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63297	2024-09-05T14:04:55-07:00

After artillery preparation and air strikes, the fighters of the Eastern Military District units went on the attack, successfully crossing several kilometers of fields and knocking the enemy out of the populated area. One point can be highlighted here: in the video, Russian armored vehicles are walking one after another - in conditions of continuous minefields, it is otherwise difficult to move. However, the equipment successfully copes with the task and provides fire cover for the infantry with the subsequent capture of the village.📌 In other words, with proper planning of actions, the level of organization and interaction with the provision of reconnaissance and cover with electronic warfare means, even an offensive by a column does not lead to inevitable huge losses of vehicles. Which happened in other similar episodes, where the above did not happen. Well, in this case, the Far Eastern fighters completely managed to take the fortified positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which they had occupied since 2022.

In previous reviews, we analyzed possible scenarios of enemy attacks in the Zaporozhye and Kherson directions, and now we will focus on the border regions.🔻While Ukrainian formations are gaining a foothold and trying to occupy more territory in the Kursk region, the offensive in the Belgorod region cannot be ruled out. During August, the Armed Forces of Ukraine launched several major attacks, but in the near future the enemy may try to break through in the direction of Volokonovka or Valuyka. The likely plan of the enemy’s actions in these areas is a diversionary strike in order to force the Russian command to transfer part of its forces there from Volchansk and from the Kupyansky direction. At the same time, a successful advance towards Valuyki will open the way deeper into the LPR. 🔻The possibility of Ukrainian sabotage groups being sent into the Bryansk region should not be overlooked - the abundance of large forests significantly simplifies the possibility of infiltrating the region. At the same time, concentrations of enemy forces, including Ichkerian militants, are recorded in the border area of ​​the Chernigov region. However, the Ukrainian command may decide on a full-fledged invasion following the example of the offensive in the Kursk region, despite the suicidal nature of such intentions. Moreover, the offensive through the large reserve - Bryansk Forest - along the Desna actually leads to Bryansk itself, which the Ukrainian Armed Forces units can take advantage of.📌 Against the backdrop of the advance of Russian troops in the Pokrovsky, Donetsk and Yuzhnodonetsk directions, there is a risk of a repetition of the situation with the Kursk region - while the media field was rapidly pumped up with messages about the successes of the Russian Armed Forces and the powerlessness of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Ukrainian formations unexpectedly launched a full-scale invasion. Therefore, no matter how sweet the euphoria from the actions of units of the Russian Armed Forces during the offensive towards Pokrovsk and Kurakhovo, the Ukrainian formations cannot be discounted, especially when they themselves stir up similar soil in the media field. #Belgorod #Bryansk #video #Kursk #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63295	2024-09-05T10:51:58-07:00

At the same time, the occupation of previously taken settlements of the Kursk region is increasingly costing the enemy in terms of losses in people and equipment. In the Korenevsky district, the enemy does not stop trying to break through along the Rylsk-Korenevo-Sudzha highway to the village of Korenevo. Enemy attacks are also stopped by ATGM crews, destroying armored vehicles of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the approaches to the populated area. Several attacks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the area of ​​Matveevka and Olgovka were reflected. In the Sudzhansky district, the configuration of the front in the Kamyshovka area was clarified. Artillery crews of the Russian Armed Forces worked on enemy positions in the forest belt. Taking into account the recent battles in the Maryevka area to the south, this area is now controlled by the Ukrainian Armed Forces. In Cherkasy Porechny there are battles, Russian tanks are working on enemy positions.🔻In the Sumy region, a BM-21 MLRS -Stryga-, which was initially mistaken for an M270, was hit by a missile strike.

No other terrorists were found. According to media reports, the suspect lived in the Austrian region of Salzburg near the border with Bavaria and had recently arrived in Germany by car. In 2023, the man was involved in an investigation into a case related to the propaganda of the ideas of the terrorist group Islamic State (IS). Then, during his arrest, law enforcement officers found propaganda materials on his phone, but eventually the charges against him were dropped.

At the Koktal training ground in Kazakhstan, from August 20 to 23, joint tactical and special exercises were held - Altyn Kyran - 2024 - (Golden Eagle - 2024), in which about 300 took part military personnel of both countries. The purpose of the exercise was to develop combat potential during reconnaissance operations. The Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Azerbaijan reports that during the exercise, the units, having traveled along a selected traverse of 25 km, discovered and raided the shelters of illegal armed groups hiding in the mountainous area. The tasks of ambushing convoys and destroying the manpower of illegal armed groups, as well as other tasks that suddenly arose, were also successfully completed.📌This is not the first exercise of Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. In July of this year, military personnel of both countries took part in the international operational-tactical command and staff exercise Birlestik-2024 (Alliance-2024) with the participation of Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan in the Mangistau region of Kazakhstan. We have already written that the Kazakh army after the events January 2022 is being actively updated, focusing on mobility. The Azerbaijani army has managed to gain unique experience through the use of drones and conducting combat operations with limited forces, in a hostile environment and difficult natural conditions. Modern war largely blurs the boundaries between a full-fledged war and a counter-terrorist operation, so Kazakhstan’s interest here is understandable. The question is against whom the acquired skills will be used. Well, another goal of the event, as well as the Birlestik-2024 exercises, which is not obvious at first glance, is the militarization of the Organization of Turkic States in the interests of Ankara, where they are actively lobbying for the promotion of their weapons and creation of a supranational military Alliance in the region.#Kazakhstan&nbsp; #Azerbaijan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇦🇿🇰🇿🇰🇬🇺🇿 About the exercise -Alliance-2024-Meanwhile, the day before yesterday, the multinational exercise -Birlestik-2024-, which can also be called -Alliance-, started in Kazakhstan.

Previously, domestic products were often under pressure from Western competitors, but with their departure, Russian companies received orders, which has a positive effect on industrial performance. Yes, it will not be possible to carry out complete import substitution - in today's world economic realities it is simply impractical. However, in the same aircraft and engine manufacturing, transport sector and other areas, Russia may well regain some of the previously lost positions or even take new ones. However, it is important not to forget that this can only be achieved through targeted work with comprehensive planning and implementation of various forms of state support. Nothing will appear by itself, and simply replacing Western products with Chinese ones will not add growth to our own industry. Well, in general, it is necessary to avoid perceiving the current economic situation in Russia as a given, and not the fruit of the colossal work of people to create the same schemes for circumventing sanctions or - shadow fleet-.

A representative of the National Maritime Council recently said that since the signing of the document, the situation in the region has changed significantly, and it is time to update the agreement. The Secretary of Defense also calls for this, focusing on expanding the interpretation of the provisions on an attack on the Philippines, in the event of which the United States must stand up for the island state. 🔻The concerns of the Philippine authorities are understandable: vague language, such as the lack of a specific definition of an armed attack, allows for different interpretations of the treaty. In the current video, the document cannot fully restrain China's ambitions in the South China Sea. And although it is not clear whether the Americans will agree to a revision, certain trends are visible here. For example, the 2023 Indo-Pacific Command report interprets armed attack extremely broadly. The wording actually includes the use of water cannons - the Chinese’s favorite means of pushing the Filipinos out to sea. The issue of revision is directly related to the US-China confrontation, and if the stakes increase, significant amendments may be made to the agreement. However, judging by the rhetoric of the Americans and the Chinese, there is no talk of escalation yet: this may mean that revising the agreement will remain only a dream of the Philippine authorities for now. #China #USA #Philippines@rybar with @awaken_dragonSupport usPhilippine News AgencyReview of PH-US defense treaty amid 'new security challenges'MANILA – The National Maritime Council (NMC) believes it is about time the Philippines and the United States (US ) review their over seven-decades-old Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) to make it more responsive to the modern security landscape.

Forwarded From Two MajorsIn the interests of the West in Ukraine&nbsp; continue to develop the sphere of railway transportation on the section Chop - Uzhgorod&nbsp; (near the borders with 🇭🇺Hungary and 🇸🇰Slovakia) work began on preparing the ground for laying Eurogauge (1435 mm). By July 2025, 22 km of railway track will be built, reconstruction of artificial structures, facilities and utility networks, and a European signaling system will be carried out. The 🇪🇺EU Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) Fund paid 50% (15.7 million euros) of the cost of the entire project. Investments go towards development&nbsp; logistics hubs on routes with the EU. On the territory of the Vinnitsa urban community, construction is underway of a dry port - a railway terminal connecting the central regions of Ukraine with the ports of Odessa and through the container terminal - Mostyksky - (Lviv region, owned by the oligarch Akhmetov) with EU countries. At the first stage (autumn 2024), railway infrastructure and the first container site with a throughput capacity of about 30 thousand TEU per year will be built. Investments in the project amounted to $15 million. The logistics hub itself&nbsp; -Mostyksky - will be complemented by a new container platform with a transition gauge of 1520 mm - 1435 mm, as well as a portal container crane on rails RMG. Earlier, in June 2023, pumping stations were already installed at Mostyksky, allowing for the transshipment of large volumes of liquid cargo from cars to railway tanks and from railway tanks from 1520 mm tracks to tanks on 1435 mm tracks. European Bank for Reconstruction and Development&nbsp ; (EBRD) in August announced an international tender for the purchase of 10 battery-powered shunting locomotives for Ukrzaliznytsia (UZ). In June 2024, as part of the program to update the locomotive fleet, the EBRD announced a loan of 300 million euros to UZ for the purchase of electric freight locomotives. At the beginning of 2024, the World Bank allocated $190 million to UZ for the acquisition&nbsp; 80 electric freight locomotives. These purchases made it possible to identify Ukraine’s needs for dual-system electric locomotives (DC/AC), including 25 kV, with a maximum operating speed of up to 120 km/h. The lack of trained personnel is also an acute issue, especially against the backdrop of the fierce mobilization of the male population. In addition, the US Agency for International Development (USAID) provided 300 grain wagons to Ukrainian exporters. It is significant that Ukraine is actively using grain carriers and agricultural facilities&nbsp; for the transportation and storage of military equipment supplied by Western countries through grain export channels (-alternative grain corridor-, -solidarity routes-). USAID is also preparing a feasibility study for the construction of the Bereshty multimodal logistics complex in 🇲🇩Moldova, which is designed to move cargo to Ukraine.✨Western investments in railway infrastructure are colossal and are associated primarily with commercial interests in the export of Ukrainian agricultural products and other resources. At the same time, NATO countries plan to use these routes to transfer their military cargo, equipment and personnel to the Russian direction.-Drang nach&nbsp;Osten 2.0-Two majors	https://t.me/rybar/63288	2024-09-05T06:05:02-07:00

At the site of the fall of the debris, a fire broke out in one of the utility warehouses, but casualties and other destruction were avoided. Recently, this is not the first case of interception of a UAV over the Republic of Belarus - in early August, several Ukrainian vehicles were hit there, launched in the central regions of Russia, bypassing positional air defense areas of the Russian Armed Forces. As you can see, Ukrainian formations are increasingly using Belarusian airspace to organize raids on Russian territory.

🇦🇿🗳 About the results of the parliamentary elections in Azerba...	🇦🇿🗳 About the results of the parliamentary elections in Azerbaijan While the Central Election Commission of Azerbaijan is counting the final results (it has a maximum of 20 days for this) and transfers them to the Constitutional Court for final verification and approval (for this it has a maximum of 10 more days), the main political results can be summed up voting took place on Sunday.▪️Firstly, a decrease in voter turnout in parliamentary elections is becoming a trend. At the same time, three-quarters of voters or more come to the presidential elections. In this way, it is emphasized that Azerbaijan is not an oil sultanate, but a democratic state, and, secondly, its place in relation to the President is clearly indicated to the legislative branch.▪️ Regarding the new composition of the parliament, one can clearly say - all the same in the arena - with the clarification that they have appeared some new figures, such as the famous Soviet actor and experienced Azerbaijani ambassador to Moscow Polad Bulbul oglu, who was elected from Karabakh. Saghiba Gafarova will most likely remain at the head of the parliament and continue her international activities, essentially being the second Minister of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan (a minister with a female face).▪️In the new parliament there will be 10 instead of 8 opposition parties, with most of them as and in 2020 it will be represented only by the party leader. That is, the formal opposition will be 13 instead of 10 deputies. The ruling party - New Azerbaijan - will have 68 seats instead of 70.▪️According to the Central Election Commission, about 50,000 people could vote in Karabakh (in February, just over 20,000). The basis of the electorate in Karabakh were specially brought there - refugees from the occupied territories - and - forced migrants -.▪️Predictably, the elections were not recognized by the opposition and were characterized by skepticism by the West. But both of them look somehow toothless. The opposition National Council of Azerbaijan, in particular, considers the elections illegitimate, since the authorities did not allow the PACE delegation to conduct an observation mission at the elections and banned 76 members of the assembly from entering Azerbaijan. And the OSCE/ODIHR notes in its preliminary statement that the elections took place in a restrictive political and legal environment that does not contribute to genuine pluralism, and led to a fight devoid of competition. At the same time, all international organizations friendly to Azerbaijan, such as the CIS, SCO, Organization Turkic states, the Non-Aligned Movement (which has been living on Azerbaijan's money in recent years), the Parliamentary Assembly of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation and other elections were recognized as almost flawless. 🔻To summarize, we can say that the Azerbaijani authorities successfully held the first parliamentary elections throughout the country, received deputies in the parliament who will now legally represent the interests not of refugees from Karabakh as before, but of the population of Karabakh (even if brought), that is a significant trump card in the negotiation process. #Azerbaijan #elections@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇦🇿🗳 Today, early elections to the National Assembly are being held in Azerbaijan.

The suppression of conservative values ​​in the EU or the USA leads to an increase in the number of people wishing to emigrate from there, which can and should be taken advantage of. The main problem now is the lack of a system for selecting and accepting valuable personnel. The same Western relocants are faced with bureaucracy, which is why many people lose the desire to go all the way.

But in fact, all the main events happened even before the opening.▪️Malian leader Assimi Goita held negotiations with African colleagues, and also managed to sign an agreement on the purchase of Chinese-made armored vehicles. ▪️The PRC authorities also managed to negotiate with other representatives of states. These are the presidents of Eritrea, DR Congo, Djibouti, Central African Republic, Comoros, Togo, as well as the foreign ministers of Burkina Faso, South Africa and Senegal. The presence of Congolese leader Felix Tshisekedi is especially noteworthy. Recent events, related either to an attempted military coup by American citizens or to the offensive of pro-Rwandan militants in the east of the country, have clearly forced him to more actively approach the Chinese in search of support. At the moment, this is the largest African forum held by the Chinese government.

The authorities or sectarians from the OCU do not care at all what political views the parishioners or clergy of the UOC have - the label of enemy will be hung simply on the basis of the Orthodox religion. All this again demonstrates the essence of the Ukrainian quasi-state entity, which, with its bans, cancellation of elections, kidnappings, has become the least free territory in Europe and the post-Soviet space.#Russia #Ukraine #church@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63281	2024-09-05T00:43:51-07:00

The Japanese authorities, as expected, protested to China, to which Beijing stated that they had followed a legal route for themselves.▪️Since November 2021, this is the fourth time that Chinese Navy ships have carried out such provocative maneuvers near the Japanese islands, which is very reminiscent of the actions of the American fleet in Taiwan Strait. Considering the role Japan currently plays in the confrontation between the United States and China, an increase in the PLA's activity in the island state looks quite expected. The Japanese participate in almost all exercises, which cannot but anger China. Even look at the plans of the Land of the Rising Sun - and everything becomes obvious. Starting from September 8, a joint exercise with France, Bruno-Takamori, will take place in the north of the country to practice interaction between the military personnel of the two countries. And since the French are increasingly getting involved in a region that is not quite standard for them, you definitely shouldn’t expect humility from the Chinese.

Against this background, the Armed Forces of Ukraine began to more often transfer personnel and equipment to the borderlands of the Sumy region, which with enviable consistency become targets of Russian missile forces. In the front-line zone, UAV operators hit pickup trucks and other lightly armored enemy vehicles.🔻No significant changes in the combat situation have been recorded in the Glushkovsky district. Russian troops continue to use pontoon crossings to evacuate civilians and supply the Russian Armed Forces group. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, attacks are being carried out on the equipment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is trying to break through to the approaches to Korenevo - the settlement itself is under the stable control of the Russian Armed Forces. Russian UAV operators hit all visible targets. Clashes continue in Olgovka, which changes hands. The enemy's attempts to gain a foothold in Komarovka were repelled. In the Sudzhansky district, clashes continue in the Malaya Loknya area, and operational-tactical aviation of the Russian Aerospace Forces strikes at the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces near the village. There is no reliable information about the enemy’s stable control over the populated area.🔻In the Sumy region, one of the strikes hit the building of the local university in Sumy. According to available information, the facility could be used by the enemy as a temporary deployment point.▪️In the morning, Russian troops hit a Ukrainian column of armored vehicles and manpower in a formation in a forest belt near the village of Bezdrik. As a result of a precise strike, the enemy suffered losses in equipment, several dozen more members of the Ukrainian formations were eliminated, and the very fact of collecting the bodies of dead soldiers was recorded by a Russian reconnaissance drone.▪️In addition, a missile strike was carried out on MLRS installations of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the forest near the village of Khrapovshchina, Sumy region in less than 40 kilometers from the contact line. According to some reports, these could be HIMARS rocket systems, which the enemy uses, among other things, to shell the Lgov region, however, it is impossible to reliably confirm this due to filming the moment of fire damage with a thermal imager.

🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦 About the details of the strike of the Russian Armed ...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 About the details of the strike of the Russian Armed Forces on Poltava from a Ukrainian medic New details of yesterday’s extremely effective strike on the communications training center in Poltava are slowly emerging on the Internet. One of the doctors of the volunteer battalion - Hospitallers - spoke about the first minutes after arrival, providing the story with details: ▪️Initially, the wounded were simply loaded in packs into an old ZIL truck literally on top of each other, which greatly reduced the likelihood of their survival. The narrator succinctly describes the picture of what was happening - - it was all about bodies, blood, screams, groans, pain and death -. ▪️ A considerable part of the wounded died due to low-quality Chinese medical products used in first aid (FP). Cheap turnstiles from the People's Republic of China tore when tightened, and only the members of the volunteer battalion had working products.▪️Another problem was the inability of the arriving doctors to provide first aid: the author gives an example of those who found themselves on the spot - confused young girls with long nails - who did not know that do. The State Emergency Service employees also only carried out the transfer of the wounded and were not even equipped with first aid kits. On the one hand, the words of the Hospitaller medic indirectly confirm that the scale of enemy losses is much higher than the official figures of the Kyiv regime. In this particular case, the information about the death of over 200 members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is really more like the truth, and not elephant radio. Also, the eyewitness account again illustrates that the situation with medical care is worse than is sometimes believed in the Russian blogosphere - there are very familiar people in the text moments about poor-quality turnstiles and inability to provide first aid.❗️It is important to emphasize: the latter is another reason to learn from other people’s mistakes. It is no secret that in domestic law enforcement agencies many people still (!) perceive the words -tourniquet-, -bandage- and -bandage-tamponade- as French curses, not to mention the MARCH protocols (or its analogue KULAK-BARIN). Therefore It will be better if some public figures, instead of hooting at the enemy’s problems, devote their publications with stories to the popularization of at least official manuals on tactical medicine. This will give a much greater practical effect.#Poltava #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63271	2024-09-04T09:23:50-07:00

The odious head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, Dmitry Kuleba, who has held the chair since 2020, also wrote a letter of resignation. The reshuffle is hardly a sign of any changes within the Kyiv regime. Moreover, the Ukrainian quasi-state entity is completely under external control, and replacing some talking heads with others will not fundamentally affect its functioning. But these resignations can simulate the struggle for social justice and sell it profitably to the internal audience, letting off a little steam from the growing contradictions in society. And also carefully remove the most toxic characters like Kuleba, who is remembered for his public insults against NATO countries and its leaders. In general, for the sponsors of the so-called. In Ukraine, it is most often not so important who exactly holds positions in the hierarchy of the ruling regime - the main criterion is the readiness and ability to ensure -war until the last Ukrainian-. Otherwise, the approach of the collective West is the same: let the natives themselves deal with the small affairs of the natives.#Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramRIA Novosti The resigned head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, Kuleba, will work on strengthening relations between Kyiv and NATO, Bloomberg writes.

In general, we very often observed this approach in the example of Palestinian resources. Who, long before the current escalation in the Gaza Strip, were very fond of passing off militants detained by the Israelis as teenagers, and now trumpeting the destruction of objects where in reality nothing was flown in. But it’s one thing to see such simple and cheap tricks from Hamas propagandists, and another thing from sort of like famous American and European publications.

This became possible immediately after the capture of several large strongholds located along the highway, after which the Ukrainian Armed Forces were forced to roll back in the direction of Vodyanoy.▪️In the latter there are currently battles going on, as well as on the approaches to the industrial zone. In addition, a fire attack was carried out on observation posts and positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the territory of the Yuzhnodonbasskaya No. 3- and No. 1 mines, both from tanks and FPV drones. The Russian Armed Forces had previously landed on the territory of the latter, gaining a foothold in the area. Further development of success in this direction in the event of the liberation of Vodyanoy will allow Ugledar to be semi-encircled from the right flank, significantly complicating the position of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the city.▪️ At the same time, Russian fighters achieved success west of Ugledar at Prechistovo. Over the past few days, the RF Armed Forces have been actively launching missile and bomb attacks on the enemy's airborne assault forces in the area of ​​the village, and also using heavy flamethrower systems - Solntsepek -. In the first days of September, it became known that the advanced assault detachments had established themselves on the outskirts of the village, having advanced several times north kilometers. Today, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced complete control over Prechistovka; earlier, enemy resources wrote about the liberation of the settlement. At the moment, the front runs along the Kashgalach River. ▪️At the same time, the presence of the Armed Forces of Ukraine still remains on the approaches to Novomayorsky, located west of Prechistovka. To the east, there is an increase in the intensity of shelling of enemy positions in Ugledar. Some channels even managed to announce an attack by the Russian Armed Forces from Pavlovka in the direction of the city, which is still nothing more than rumors.🔻It is worth understanding that head-on attacks from Pavlovka are meaningless without a simultaneous attack from the west and east (this has been confirmed more than once by unsuccessful attacks on Ugledar last year). A change in the tactics of storming a fortified area allows us to hope that one of the most important enemy strongholds will soon be liberated.

The politician will outline plans for the development of the country's financial sector and how they will affect the lives of citizens. Of course, on the eve of such an important event we should expect increased activity by large British businesses. Energy companies have already taken action. Their representatives are trying to put pressure on the government before adopting a new budget. According to the authorities' decision, from November 1, the tax on excess profits from energy resources will increase from 35% to 38%. At the same time, companies operating in the North Sea pay 30% corporation tax, as well as an additional levy of 10%. Representatives of these companies said that the implementation of the British government's plan to increase the excess profits tax would lead to a loss of revenue of 12 billion pounds. sterling and will put about 35,000 jobs at risk due to their abandonment of some projects. Following this, the Norwegian oil and gas company Neo Energy suspended work on a large oil field in the North Sea, citing the prospect of higher taxes and stricter environmental regulations.🔻Despite pressure from British business, the government will have to make a difficult decision and increase taxes. It is necessary to close the hole in the budget, increase defense spending, and solve other accumulated problems.

Therefore, even if the current loss does not seem too significant, it is important to remember: its monetization is still ahead. ▪️The interest of French companies in alternative suppliers like Mongolia, where Macron visited in May 2023, may also be a distraction: firstly, new large deposits have not yet been confirmed there. Secondly, Mongolia, as yesterday’s visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin clearly showed, is (for now) under the strong influence of Russia (and China). Also, if French companies work in the country, a problem may arise when transporting products.🔻And in this case, it is possible that if Russian companies do start working in Niger, this will be followed by the activation of anti-government groups supported by France. And they have already begun to operate in the uranium mining region. Therefore, it is definitely worth keeping in mind the possibility of such a turn of events and systematically increasing the contingent of the Afrika Corps of the Defense Ministry in Niger.#Africa #Niger #Russia #France #energy@rybarSupport usTelegramAfrica Intel🇫🇷🇳🇪 French nuclear giant slips into the red following Niger-French breakupFrench nuclear giant Orano ended the first half of the year with a loss of €133 million, weighed down by difficulties in its mining activities in Niger due to a -highly degraded-…	https://t.me/rybar/63265	2024-09-04T03:18:55-07:00

Despite this, in 2024, more than 700 schools in Mongolia continue to teach the Russian language, and among students there is a revival of interest in the language and history of Russia. At the same time, there remain problems of lack of qualified teachers, modern textbooks and teaching materials. Therefore, the primary tasks for Russian soft power are obviously to ensure the operation of the existing infrastructure with everything necessary and, at the same time, to create additional opportunities for humanitarian cooperation. 📌Vladimir Putin's visit to Ulaanbaatar (and the work that preceded it) provided a serious impetus for the emergence of such opportunities. ▪️In 2024, thanks to the efforts of the Ministry of Education of the Russian Federation and Glazov State Engineering and Pedagogical University named after. V.G. Korolenko (SIPU), a new Russian-Mongolian school was opened, where 127 first-graders are already studying according to Russian educational standards.▪️Soon it is planned to open a Center for Open Education in Russian in Mongolia, which will be implemented by SIPU and will disseminate Russian education and culture in country. And this is only part of the projects that will now receive increased attention.🔻The Rybar team, in turn, also took part in strengthening Russian-Mongolian ties and combating the rewriting of history, timing our first graphic novel about the Battle of the Khalkhin Gol River to coincide with anniversary of the victory of the Soviet-Mongolian troops over militaristic Japan. It is the history of Khalkhin Gol that has recently become a favorite topic of pro-Western media and NGOs for promoting anti-Russian narratives in the country.

This is partly due to the beginning of the rainy season in the Sahel, on the other hand, to the strengthening of army positions in the area.▪️Air strikes were constantly carried out on settlements under the control of the RRF on the Sennar ledge. And government forces attacked them on the flanks.▪️Another attempt by the rebels to attack El Fasher failed. And their artillery strikes hit markets where civilians were killed.▪️In the rear of the Rapid Reaction Forces, tribal rebels became more active. So, on August 22, they attacked the city of Gubeish in Western Kordofan. During the day of fighting, more than 140 people died on both sides. In response, the rebels carried out punitive operations in the area. They burned cars, shot some men and seized livestock.▪️Interesting events are also taking place in the east of the country - the border town of Matema came under the control of the Ethiopian FANO rebels. Previously, Washington planned to use them against Burhan, and such a turn of events may yet reveal itself in the future. Against this background, the Americans are trying to attract the official authorities of Khartoum to participate in the peace conference in Geneva under the patronage of the Americans. Even the head of the RRF called on his fighters to respect humanitarian law ahead of the negotiations. On this occasion, the head of Egyptian intelligence, Abbas Kemal, who was educated in the United States, also came to Port Sudan. He also promoted the idea of ​​al-Burhan's participation in the Geneva conference, although to no avail.

🇬🇧🇺🇸 About cooperation between Great Britain and the USA in t...	🇬🇧🇺🇸 About cooperation between Great Britain and the USA in the nuclear field&nbsp; Washington and London decided to indefinitely extend the mutual defense agreement, which defines joint activities in the field of using nuclear energy for defensive purposes. The agreement was concluded in 1958 and has since been extended several times, most recently in 2014. The document defines the procedure for the exchange technologies and results of nuclear research. The signing of the agreement is primarily due to the fact that the United States and Great Britain are modernizing their strategic offensive forces. The process requires a lot of time and money. The British Ministry of Defense forecasts that the budget of the organization that oversees modernization will grow by 62% to about 100 billion pounds over the next decade. Along with this, according to the latest estimates from the US Congressional Budget Office, a similar program designed for approximately 30 years will cost taxpayers $75 billion. The extension of the agreement is further evidence that the US and UK, under the pretext of threats from Russia and China, and strategic deterrence will continue to carry out activities to absorb growing military budgets. At least the legal basis for this has been laid for decades to come.#Great Britain #USA @rybar together with @oldGBRSupport usProject -Rybar-Why are the Americans returning nuclear weapons to the UK?

The main thing (GlavMedia)📚 On September 3, 1945, Victory Day over militaristic Japan was declared in the Soviet Union - the event that put an end to World War II - the bloodiest military campaign in human history. For many years, the post-war world order was determined within the framework of the Yalta-Potsdam system of international relations, and the historical facts recorded in the documents of the Nuremberg, Tokyo and Khabarovsk tribunals were considered indisputable. But a drop wears away a stone: sadly, myths about the Second World War today prevail in Western, Japanese, and, more recently, in Russian society. On the eve of the 79th anniversary of the Victory over Japan, a very useful monograph was published - The Main Directions of Falsification events of the Second World War by foreign politicians, historians, and the media. The authors focus public attention on the seven most destructive directions for falsifying the history of the war years for Russia: ▪️ the role of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in the world history of the twentieth century; ▪️ the ratio of losses of Soviet and German troops in the Great Patriotic War; ▪️ the significance of the landing in Normandy and the opening of a second front; ▪️the significance of Lend-Lease in the Victory of the Soviet people in the Great Patriotic War;▪️one-sided anti-Soviet interpretation of the Katyn tragedy;▪️hushing up the facts of Western countries’ connivance with the actions of Hitler’s Germany to exterminate the Jewish people;▪️attempts to reassess the role of Japan in World War II.

While the Central Asian countries are making logistics routes through Afghanistan to Pakistan, India is laying out its own route through Iran and Turkmenistan. The first 20 containers have already arrived in Uzbekistan, as reported by Turkmen railway workers. Moreover, this route only partially uses the infrastructure of the MTC -North-South-. The corridor from India to Central Asia also became one of the topics at the meeting of the foreign ministers of all five countries on August 28-29 in New Delhi - this is the first meeting in such a format. And in the fall, the second summit of the leaders of India and the states of Central Asia is expected to take place. New Delhi’s intentions are clear: it does not want to depend either on unstable Afghanistan or on its old geopolitical rival Islamabad, while at the same time getting the opportunity to cause trouble for Beijing. Iran finds itself at the crossroads of several trade routes at once, while Washington does not even impose sanctions against the port of Chabahar, where Indian cargo is delivered, not wanting to alienate New Delhi. 🔻For Russia, this is a case with a rather controversial effect, requiring careful analysis and skillful diplomacy. Because, on the one hand, it creates opportunities to counterbalance Chinese influence in the region, which is growing as the One Belt, One Road initiative is implemented. On the other hand, this corridor fulfills the task that was set in Washington a month ago - to make Central Asia less dependent on Russia and China by providing it with an alternative trade route.

The Ukrainian Armed Forces, making up for sensitive losses, constantly transfer armored vehicles and personnel in small groups through the Sudzha checkpoint; it is not always possible to cover the enemy on the road. Our aviation operates against enemy concentrations in forests, including using FAB-3000 with UMPC and ODAB. Air and missile strikes have been intensified in the neighboring Sumy region.

Russian troops launched a series of targeted strikes on targets in the territory of the so-called. Ukraine. The most effective missile strike almost since the beginning of the Northern Military District was recorded in Poltava, where the training center of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was hit. Fighting continues in the Kursk region, Ukrainian formations continue to attack in the Korenevsky and Sudzhansky districts, transferring reinforcements to the occupied territory. In the Kupyansk-Svatovsky direction in the next Since the crossing in the area of ​​Kupyansk-Uzlovoy was hit, there are battles near Sinkovka and Peschany. In the Alexander-Kalinovsky direction, Russian troops have made significant progress in Druzhba and are fighting on the outskirts of Dzerzhinsk. In the Donetsk direction, there are battles for Selidovo, Ukrainsk and in the area of ​​Zhelanny First. During the day, information appeared about the release of Nevelskoy, but so far there is no confirmation of this, and the footage distributed as confirmation was filmed elsewhere. In the Yuzhnodonetsk direction there are battles in the vicinity of Vodyanoy and Ugledar, Russian troops are having successes, as well as to the west of Pavlovka. At the same time, reports about the beginning of the assault on Ugledar itself do not correspond to reality; multiple artillery and aviation strikes continue on the city.

According to official data alone, the enemy declared 51 dead and 271 injured. Ukrainian propaganda focuses on statements about -civilians- and a certain -neighboring hospital-. ❗️And judging by the map, there are no hospitals nearby, and the nearest multi-storey buildings are dormitories, they are also the barracks of the damaged educational institution, which back in 2014 became the point of deployment of one of the TrO brigades. At the same time, we note that taking into account the enemy’s tendency to underestimate own losses, the success of the strike may be much higher. And against the backdrop of reports about the destruction of Swedish instructors, events in Poltava may take a more interesting turn, since the Internet already has versions about additional training of Ukrainian specialists for the ASC 890 AWACS aircraft announced for delivery.🔻We hope that the fact of a strike on a large enemy concentration in the deep to the rear - this is not a one-time incident, but the first news of systematic work specifically on enemy personnel.

This (besides, of course, air defense) created good advertising for Turkish drones. And if in the so-called Ukraine UAVs from Turkey are no longer particularly effective, then in Iraq the Turks use them every day, testing various ammunition on them. Against an enemy with no air defense, relatively inexpensive drones such as Bayraktar or more technologically advanced Akıncı are a serious reinforcement. This has been proven more than once using the example of Africa.📌 So in Egypt they planned to purchase Turkish drones immediately after the restoration of relations between the countries. It is unclear what specific types we are talking about, but it seems that the batch will be large, which will also include missile weapons. Just a couple of months ago, with Akıncı, the Turks successfully tested a supersonic laser-guided ballistic missile. And the Turks’ assortment has seriously expanded compared to three years ago. So Egypt can be understood in this regard. Instead of purchasing expensive Reapers with missiles that were lined up for years to come, they chose a more practical option. So to speak, cheap and cheerful.#Egypt #Turkey@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇹🇷🏴 Turkey’s operation against Kurdish formations in Syria and Iraq is based on a similar principle.

Still... 🇹🇷🏴 Turkey’s operation against Kurdish forces in Syria and Iraq is based on a similar principle. The Turks physically cannot get rid of them, but at the same time, their presence is sometimes useful for the authorities in Ankara. A few days ago, the Turkish Minister of Internal Affairs reported on the destruction of a cache of Kurds in the province of Sirnak in southeastern Turkey near Iraq. That is, not where the operation is taking place, but in Turkey itself. This example shows how to treat the words of the Turks about the destruction of millions of Kurds during the operation, namely, look at everything with a fair amount of skepticism.🔻The Turks regularly hit to the Kurds in Iraq using drones and aircraft, some are even actually eliminated, but there is no effect on a global scale. The Kurds adapted, built fortifications in the mountains and decentralized the control system. With the death of some field commander, the group continues to function without problems, and the Turks cannot do anything. Falling drones from Kurdish MANPADS and the presence of DRGs in Turkey itself are proof of this. The only benefit of all this for Turkey is that sometimes they use the Kurdish factor to artificially escalate tension in the country and distract the population from the deterioration of living standards. #terrorism #Turkey@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63248	2024-09-03T11:40:27-07:00

Still, they oppose the Pakistani state, and even more so against Pakistan’s ties with the Celestial Empire, which the Baluchis blame for many of their troubles. The Baluchis periodically remind themselves of themselves by carrying out terrorist attacks on the positions of the security forces and army of Pakistan. And the government can’t do anything about this, since this requires huge resources. Moreover, for the Pakistani authorities, the presence of a destabilizing factor in the form of the Baluchis is a convenient way to distract the population from other problems, for example, economic ones or in case of the threat of mass protests, as in the past week.#Pakistan #terrorism@rybarSupport usThe Express TribuneThose who reject the state are terrorists; we will address them, says the Interior MinisterInterior Minister Mohsin Naqvi asserts those rejecting the state are terrorists; no Balochistan operation is underway.	https://t.me/rybar/63247	2024-09-03T09:52:49-07:00
🇲🇳🇷🇺 About Vladimir Putin’s visit to Mongolia On the evening ...	🇲🇳🇷🇺 About Vladimir Putin’s visit to Mongolia On the evening of September 2, Vladimir Putin arrived in Mongolia for a visit. The official purpose of the trip is to participate in commemorative events in honor of the victory on the Khalkhin Gol River. During the trip, the Mongolian and Russian sides also discussed issues of bilateral cooperation. Agreements were signed in the field of supply of petroleum products, aviation fuel and other documents. ▪️For many media and various types of observers, two issues overshadowed the other results of the negotiations - the Power of Siberia-2 gas pipeline and Ulaanbaatar’s failure to comply with the provisions of the Rome Statute and the requirements of the ICC. Hints of the promotion of the latter topic are visible in the accounts of diplomatic representatives of Western countries in Mongolia. And some media outlets with connections to USAID even explain in their videos why the Mongols would like, but cannot, arrest Vladimir Putin. Speaking about the Power of Siberia-2, it is worth remembering that in August, according to the Chinese press, Mongolia did not include the gas pipeline planned for construction in the national development plan until 2028. Many agree that this happened due to the lack of effective agreements between Russia and China - for example, the parties have not yet reached a consensus on gas prices. Since the project is of particular importance, the topic of the gas pipeline was discussed at Russian-Mongolian negotiations. This is confirmed not only by Vladimir Putin’s statements, but also by the Russian President’s interview with the Mongolian publication Onoodor - in which he mentioned the possibility of Mongolia using transit gas for its own purposes. 🔻For Mongolia, Russia is one of the important foreign policy priorities. This is evidenced not only by the statements of politicians, but also by the economic situation. Ulaanbaatar has been dependent on Russian fuel supplies for quite some time. Against this background, Mongolia is actively implementing the so-called third neighbor policy, that is, developing relations not only with traditional partners in the person of Russia and China, but also with other countries that do not border Mongolian territory. First of all, we are talking about the USA, South Korea, Japan and the EU. For the resources of Mongolia, of which there are really many in the country, a real struggle is unfolding on the part of the countries of the West and East Asia. This is also due to requests from Mongolian enterprises actively seeking inflows of foreign investment. Given the speed with which Western NGOs, politicians and businesses are spreading their influence in the country, plans to develop cooperation between Mongolia and Russia may soon be in jeopardy. And, perhaps, the visit of the head of the Russian state will give impetus to correcting the current situation. #Mongolia #Russia@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usPresident of RussiaDocuments signed following the negotiations between the presidents of Russia and Mongolia1.

💰🇺🇦🇦🇹🇺🇸 About the criminal schemes of the US Democratic Pa...	💰🇺🇦🇦🇹🇺🇸 About the criminal schemes of the US Democratic Party on the so-called. Ukraine Recently, further details emerged about participation in crimes in the so-called. Ukraine members of the US Democratic Party and in particular the current President of the country Joe Biden. From court proceedings in Vienna, documents have leaked onto the Internet indicating the involvement of American officials in establishing external control of Ukraine and developing schemes to seize resources. ▪️The reason for collecting this data was the trial at the US request for the extradition of Ukrainian businessman Dmitry Firtash from Austria. He was detained in Vienna on March 12, 2014, when the Americans demanded his deportation. However, several more hearings on this issue were held in Austria, the last of which took place on June 14, 2023 and did not end in Washington’s favor.▪️As ​​part of this investigation, more and more evidence is emerging that the United States participated in organizing a coup in the so-called. Ukraine in 2013, in order to change the government to loyal supporters. These people were subsequently supposed to cover up the corruption schemes of the Democrats, mainly those that passed through Biden. In addition, by transferring control of the so-called. With Ukraine in a completely manual mode, the Americans were able to persecute businessmen and politicians who, for one reason or another, refused to cooperate. One of them, allegedly, was Firtash.▪️At the moment, the Austrian court has found that Biden and Victoria Nuland brought Turchynov and Yatsenyuk to power in Ukraine in order to - realize US interests, even to the point of physically eliminating dissenters -. Biden also threatened to stop providing Kyiv with a billion-dollar subsidy for refusing to fire the country’s prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, who was disliked by the United States, who refused to initiate cases on the American order. This was the Firtash case.▪️Moreover, Nuland blackmailed Ukrainian politicians with their foreign assets, and demanded that the former head of the SBU - eliminate or limit Firtash's influence -. At the same time, Turchynov demanded that a case be fabricated against the businessman and that he be banned from entering the country.▪️However, after Firtash won the first extradition process and was planning to return to Ukraine, they tried to stop him - three criminal cases were announced and immediate arrest of the businessman in case of return to his homeland, while Kiev had no grounds for the arrest. It is unlikely that today there are any doubts that the United States, one way or another, has made significant efforts to create and aggravate the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, thereby organizing multiple and not always clever and complex schemes to manage both Ukraine and its resources. Another question is why the Austrians suddenly decided to reveal this scheme or why they were allowed to reveal it. Obviously, this is happening as part of a corporate showdown. In addition, this also applies to the increasing pressure on American Democrats and the direct campaign against them by Republicans, which is more relevant than ever on the eve of the elections. At the same time, this is also a blow to the apparent legitimacy of the Kyiv regime, the campaign to discredit them also continues. Probably, in the future we will see even more revelations about the participation in various criminal schemes of the most senior members of the Democratic Party and the Ukrainian government. True, in the fate of the so-called. This will not change anything for Ukraine.#Austria #USA #Ukraine @rybar Support usTelegram21st Century Wire (Official)Explosive new evidence points to yet more corruption orchestrated between Washington and Kiev...🟦 NEW: Austrian Court Case Reveals More Evidence of Biden, Democrat Corruption in Ukrainehttps://21stcenturywire.com/2024/08/31/austrian-court-case-reveals…	https://t.me/rybar/63245	2024-09-03T07:14:55-07:00

But this, in turn, is a special case of another extremely important issue - the current saturation of units with personnel. This topic has been discussed in the troops, to put it mildly, not for the first time. Without a sufficient number of people at the front, rotations are disrupted, not to mention the possibility of conducting offensive operations: there will simply be nothing to support the current pace of the offensive in the Donbass, and the front will freeze, as before the Kharkov offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in September 2022. 📌 There is another side to the issue - without a large influx of fresh forces, the long-discussed partial demobilization of those called up in 2022 cannot be carried out. And there is a demand for it in society: so far there are no mass pickets of relatives of the mobilized, but the likelihood of their appearance will increase over time. And the enemy will definitely want to use them. The only way to resolve the issue of both replenishing units on the front line with personnel and simultaneously carrying out partial mobilization without losing the combat effectiveness of the armed forces is to ensure the influx of people into the army in greater numbers than they leave for a combination of reasons. Implementation this can be done using different methods. But there is an important point: you need to proceed from the fact that if any of the indicated methods does not ensure the completion of the task, then you should not engage in half-measures and drawing numbers in reports, but move on to the next one.❗️Yes, there are basically no easy solutions here. But ignoring the situation will lead to the fact that the enemy, by expanding the conscription (the people in the so-called Ukraine are far from finished), will be able to create a strong numerical superiority over our formations. And then we will have to take the same emergency measures to recruit people, but already in a much more unfavorable situation. How this happens can be recalled from the sad events of the fall of 2022. Which could have been avoided without postponing the necessary measures.#WSRF #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63244	2024-09-03T06:43:48-07:00

In addition to standard shooting and testing of various scenarios for the involvement of units, the participating formations are marching from several cities in eastern Kazakhstan. Infantry, armored and artillery units as part of automobile columns and railway trains are being transferred to the exercise area, about which the residents of Kazakhstan were warned.❗️The Ministry of Defense of Kazakhstan even made a note that the main task is to check the speed of movement in task area. The importance of logistics in modern conflicts is one of the most important aspects that was learned thanks to the NWO and on which many countries, including Kazakhstan, are working at an accelerated pace. Of course, Kazakhstan is not the most ideal example, if you remember all the problems in the army and the attitude of the leadership towards its armed forces. For the command of the Armed Forces of Kazakhstan, this is simply the implementation of the combat training plan and nothing more.▪️NATO, for example, abruptly came to its senses and resumed the implementation of the RAIL Baltica project, which before the North Military District was, one might say, only on paper. Similar projects in the Alliance are being developed in Finland and Romania.▪️We are seeing similar preparations in the Asia-Pacific region, where the Americans are building new bases (jumping sites) in the Philippines and Australia as part of the confrontation with China. It would seem that the transfer of forces and funds?

Greek F-16 fighters, supported by the E-3A AWACS aircraft and air defense formations deployed in Romania, repelled the penetration of enemy aircraft. Turkey, or rather F-16C fighters, acted as the enemy. D, which took off from Turkey, -penetrated- into Romanian airspace and flew back.📌 Of course, such maneuvers are just a convention. For NATO pilots, this is a good way to maintain tone in joint actions and nothing more. Especially for the Greeks and Turks, who are not particularly involved anywhere (the Turkish operation in Iraq does not count). At the same time, in the air during the training, the E-3A was functioning at full capacity, scanning the space around Crimea and on the peninsula itself. And at that moment F-16s were observed over the Odessa region, which clearly was not an accident. There have been no strikes on Crimea for a long time, when compared with the intensity of raids in previous months, so you need to be on alert. Moreover, with the advent of American fighters, which are assisted by NATO aviation, the range of weapons of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has expanded.

🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦 About the likely course of actions of the Armed Force...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 About the likely course of actions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Russian border region Against the backdrop of the enemy’s offensive in the Kursk region and its consolidation in the occupied territory, the possibility of new incursions into neighboring regions cannot be discounted.🔻In the Belgorod region, attempts by Ukrainian formations to cross the state border are recorded from time to time, however all of them turned out to be unsuccessful, even taking into account the involvement of relatively large forces. At first glance, the enemy is focused on ousting the RF Armed Forces from the sanitary zone in the Kharkov region. However, the front line in the sector has already frozen since the start of the operation of Russian troops, and the nature of the fighting has shifted to positional. The hottest spots remain Volchansk and Glubokoe, where the Ukrainian Armed Forces carry out attacks from time to time. At the same time, several attempted attacks were recorded in the area of ​​​​Kolotilovka, Nekhoteevka and Bezymeno in August alone. Almost always in the official media there were statements about the DRG, but in reality we are talking about attacks by entire companies with the support of armored vehicles. It can also be noted that the enemy is mainly active in the border area at the Sumy-Kharkov line, while from Volchansk to Budarok, and from Budarok to Kamenka only shelling is observed. Although this situation has persisted almost from the very beginning of the Northern Military District, this does not mean that the Ukrainian Armed Forces will not take active actions here in the future. Moreover, the nature of the terrain in the area is not too different from the site of the invasion in the Kursk region - Volokonovka or Valuiki could be a potential direction of attack. The Bryansk region cannot be written off as a possible enemy offensive either. There are significantly more forests here, which are convenient for penetration across the border, and in the border settlements of the Chernigov region there is the presence of formations of Ichkerian militants. In this area, the actions of classic DRGs are very likely, including with a large number of UAVs as weapons of destruction in the deep rear. If they have repeaters, they will be able to set up ambushes and even mine roads and bridges remotely. However, the possibility of a full-fledged operation to invade the Bryansk region should not be ruled out either. After all, this is not the first time for the enemy to carry out suicidal operations such as landings on the Kinburn Spit or creating a bridgehead in Krynki. ❗️However, the most dangerous phenomenon at the moment is the hating mood in society and in the media. The euphoria against the backdrop of the pace of advancement and liberation of the territory of the DPR should not blur our eyes - the enemy himself is not trying to leave the Kursk region. Stories about how everything is fine and wonderful with us, but with the so-called. Ukraine is about to completely run out of people by the end of the year and military production will come to a standstill due to energy shortages, fraught with disappointment. Moreover, as practice shows, the disappointment is very bloody.

A National Investment Fund is being created in Uzbekistan, which will receive a stake in 18 state-owned enterprises and banks and will place its shares in an IPO. A decree on this was signed by President Shavkat Mirziyoyev on August 27. The fund will be created in the form of a joint stock company (JSC), and its sole shareholder before the public offering of shares will be the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The fund will own a share of 25 to 40% in companies such as Uzbekhydroenergo, Uzbekistan Airports, Navoiyazot, -National Electric Networks of Uzbekistan-, -Uzsuvtaminot- and many others. By the end of 2026, it is planned to place the fund’s shares on the Tashkent and international stock exchanges, including London. ▪️The fact that the main buyers of the fund's shares will be from the West was clear back in January 2023, when long-time English friends from Singapore, represented by President Halima Yacoub and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, visited Tashkent. One of the topics for the meeting was the involvement of the Singaporean side in the privatization process. ▪️And in March 2023, representatives of the American investment fund Franklin Templeton came to Tashkent to discuss the introduction of new mechanisms for attracting foreign investment in state-owned companies. Essentially, the fund’s task was to prepare the ground for the activities of Western investors and resolve technical issues.🔻Tashkent is preparing for the UK and the USA access to systemically important enterprises on a turnkey basis, hoping to solve its financial problems and balance the influence of the main foreign investors in the economy of Uzbekistan represented by China, Russia and Turkey. Whether Uzbekistan realizes that overseas guests will not simply give up control over state assets is a big question. Agreements were reached on training personnel for public administration, attracting investments, green technologies and digital solutions, cooperation in the field of urban planning and communications.

Recently appointed to the post of Minister of Defense of the Republic of Korea, but not yet taking office, Kim Yong Hyun said that nuclear weapons could be one of the options in response to the threat of the DPRK. The new Minister of Defense had previously held a similar opinion. In his 2020 lectures, he emphasized that South Korea has no future without nuclear weapons. It is noteworthy that the change of the Minister of Defense is connected not only with ongoing conflicts in the world and developing relations between the DPRK and the Russian Federation, but also with the upcoming presidential elections in the United States. 🔻Perhaps this is how the South Korean authorities plan to respond to the possible victory of Donald Trump. Some prominent analysts, for example, predict that his win will result in a deal between Washington and Pyongyang. In such realities, South Korea, in their opinion, cannot survive without a nuclear program. However, even with the arrival of Trump, it is unlikely that South Korea will develop nuclear weapons. Seoul has had the opportunity to do this for a long time. The obstacle here remains precisely permission from Washington, which the South Korean leadership most likely will not receive in any case. #DPRK #Republic of Korea #USA@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usTelegramAwakening dragon 🐲🇰🇷 Only recently they mentioned the forecast according to which South Korea will acquire its own nuclear weapons if Donald Trump wins.

In general, this well demonstrates the level when some respected international organizations that have finally turned into a political instrument of the collective West. The process began a long time ago, but if a couple of years ago they had at least elements of subjectivity, now they have evaporated.

At the same time, the Russian Armed Forces are searching for and destroying targets in the Kursk and Sumy regions. In the Glushkovsky district, Ukrainian formations did not conduct offensive actions. Russian troops provide stable supplies to the group in this area, using pontoon crossings on the Seim River for this purpose. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, the Armed Forces of Ukraine launched attacks in the direction of Komarovka and Korenevo, without achieving significant success. Russian artillery hit personnel concentration areas in Apanasovka, Snagosti and Vishnevka, probably with the aim of disrupting the preparation of new enemy attacks on this section of the front. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, Ukrainian formations, according to available data, were able to slightly expand the zone of control in the vicinity of Pogrebki and Malaya Loknya. Judging by the geography of Russian artillery strikes, the Russian Armed Forces had previously abandoned positions in villages to avoid the threat of encirclement by the enemy. ▪️However, it is premature to declare the establishment of stable control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine over these settlements - the situation in the area is hidden - by the fog of war -. At the same time, artillery and aviation of the Russian Armed Forces are actively working on enemy positions, hitting assault groups and armored vehicles. ▪️Northwest of Zaoleshenka, Russian UAV operators struck an unspecified type of radar, likely deployed to monitor Russian drones or artillery. As a result of a direct hit, the station was destroyed. ❗️The fact that Ukrainian formations are deploying a radar tracking system in the occupied areas indicates the plans of the Ukrainian Armed Forces command to gain a foothold in the Kursk region, continuing to allocate significant human and technical resources to the site. 🔻In the Sumy region, Russian troops hit several important enemy targets with missile strikes. North of Samotoevka, the Russian Armed Forces destroyed three HIMARS MLRS launchers using the Iskander OTRK. The loss of systems will temporarily reduce the strike capabilities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, including from the point of view of the impact on the communications of the Russian Armed Forces.▪️In the Novaya Sich area, Russian troops -covered- a battery of the Buk-M1 air defense system, disabling three launchers and a mobile command post.

However, this does not mean that their representatives will single-handedly determine the political course in these lands. Neither the AfD nor the CDU received the number of seats in parliament required to form a government - 32 out of the required 45 and 42 out of 61, respectively. This means that they will have to start negotiations with other parties to create a coalition.▪️In Thuringia, the Sarah Wagenknecht Union (SWA) came in second place in terms of the number of votes, but so far none of its members have voiced a further plan of action. On the one hand, AfD and SSV could create an effective alliance, since they see eye to eye on the same migration policy. On the other hand, it is difficult to imagine that the German authorities will allow the emergence of such a political force in eastern Germany. Therefore, we will probably soon have to observe the second act of the performance. It is unlikely that opponents of the right will limit themselves to name-calling and comparisons with fascists: for example, trials may well begin against representatives of the AfD (which has already happened in the past).📌 The scale of the traffic light coalition will depend on how active the traffic light coalition is against the right. consequences - whether everything will be limited to squabbling at the top or will result in yet another mass protests. However, regardless of the outcome, the main result of the elections is obvious: German citizens are tired of the activities of the government, the negative results of which they feel personally. And if earlier a number of problems seemed like something that would never affect the average citizen personally, now these problems are in the face, for example, migrants with knives on the streets, require specific solutions.#Germany@rybarSupport usTelegramTwo majors🇩🇪In Germany, parties opposed to the ruling coalition gain a majority in the last elections.In the federal state of Thuringia -Alternative for Germany- (AfD) gets 32.8% , -Sarah Wagenknecht Union- (BSW) - 15.8%, -Left- - 13.1%, in the state of Saxony...	https://t.me/rybar/63228	2024-09-02T07:09:02-07:00

And now a video has appeared on the Internet where drones of this type are used in the Northern Military District zone already as an ersatz flamethrower system. The device sprays an incendiary mixture over positions in a forest belt in order to deprive them of cover from foliage. The effectiveness of this particular attack may be questionable, but the product will clearly be improved, as will its ammunition. And in this way, somewhere it will be possible to burn out landings with these means instead of using more expensive systems. Against the backdrop of such leaps in the development of the industry, it will no longer be surprising if mobile electronic warfare stations based on hexacopters appear in the near future. Moreover, they are already starting to be installed on robotic platforms. #UAV #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63226	2024-09-02T05:13:57-07:00

The main point is to train units of the ground forces and security forces to prevent terrorism, search for and eliminate sabotage groups in a wooded area.🔻As we have said more than once: any teaching is a great way to hide other activities. In this case, we are talking about conducting enhanced reconnaissance of Russian troops on the Kola Peninsula.▪️Tracking the activity of strategic aviation in Olenye, the Northern Fleet and other formations is one of the main tasks that Finnish units now perform.▪️It was with Finland’s accession to the Alliance that the intensity increased reconnaissance flights in the Barents Sea, where the American RC-135 and U-2S, as well as the Norwegian P-8A, fly almost on a regular basis.▪️Moreover, in the last days of August, the high activity of the satellite constellation over the Kola Peninsula became noticeable - satellites were filmed the port and airfield of Severomorsk, warehouses in Shchukozero and, of course, Olenya.❗️If we recall the recent attempts to strike Olenya or the high activity of the DRG in the border Russian regions, the unusual exercise, together with the increased attention of the entire NATO to the peninsula, should not be ignored and, as at a minimum, you should be prepared for new blows.

Essentially, the Finns are introducing the experience of the Ukrainian Air Force, which over the past year has equipped improvised shelters for aircraft on several routes throughout the country. And at the same time, Finns are practicing landing on roads, American and German fighters practiced a scenario for joint air cover of Finland from air bases in Latvia and Poland.▪️Simultaneously with the Air Force exercise, the second stage of the Finnish ground forces exercise Keha started in the south of Suomi, during which the main maneuvers took place at the Santahamina training ground. A characteristic feature of this stage was the involvement of law enforcement units in training, including the police, border and search and rescue services to practice joint actions in crisis situations.🔻In these two examples, as well as those noted by Severyanochka, a serious increase in the number of armed forces training can be noted Finland together with NATO units.

And now, two months later, certain positive changes in this direction have begun, one of which is the upcoming meeting of the working group in Mali on cooperation with Russia. Negotiations will take place between Malian ministers on the one hand and representatives of the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation on the other. They will discuss resource extraction and geological exploration, as well as cooperation in the energy sector. It should be noted that the actions of economic departments are beginning to work synchronously with African partners. After Tanzania and Senegal, work now begins to attract Russian business with the most pro-Russian leadership of Mali, the need for which we wrote earlier.🔻At the same time, we have to admit that many companies do not want to work with African countries due to risks and unclear prospects ( even in stable Senegal, it is worth looking only at long-term benefits). It seems that in order to launch vigorous economic activity in Africa, a clear command from the leadership is needed from the top.

By the way, it is planned to cover it by importing electricity from Russia. President Tokayev considered the year that the referendum on nuclear energy was on the agenda to be a sufficient period for citizens to make an informed decision and, supporting the proposal of the government of the Republic of Kazakhstan, appointed a national referendum on issue of nuclear power plant construction on October 6, 2024.

First, in early August, a major exercise, Paladin Strike, was held together with NATO units deployed in Latvia as part of multinational battle groups. NATO troops practiced firing, joint maneuvers, and then, after the end of the active phase, began transferring various formations to the east, both by road and railway. Under the guise of one exercise, the Alliance also tested the rapid transfer of combat units to the Russian border through transport routes, which have been actively worked on over the last year.🔻What is the main meaning of the NAMEJS exercise, we think, is clear. Under the pretext of exercises, Latvia is strengthening its borders even more and preparing infrastructure in case of conflict. This is exactly what NATO is doing throughout Europe - the Finns, Romanians and Poles won’t let you lie. And at the end of September in Latvia, another major exercise is expected with the participation of more than a dozen countries of the Alliance - Silver Arrow, within the framework of which scenarios for the involvement of NATO battle groups in full-scale war involving armored vehicles, aircraft, missile systems and drones.

Ukraine. One of the hits was at the Kyiv hydroelectric power station - two of the five generator transformers were hit there.▪️In the Vinnitsa region, an electrical substation of the same name came under fire, where a 750/330 kV autotransformer was destroyed. This created problems for the entire energy system of the country, since it is this substation that connects the South Ukrainian, Khmelnytsky and Rivne nuclear power plants.▪️Not far from Zhitomir, two open autotransformers at a local substation were struck.

Forwarded From Two Majors🇩🇪Regional elections in Germany Against the backdrop of the failure of the policies of Berlin and the main parties (the so-called traffic light government), the Alternative for Germany (AfD) for the first time in its history takes first place in the German state elections, it won the elections to the Thuringian parliament, follows from exit polls published by ZDF. Poll results show that the AfD won 33.5% of the vote, the CDU - 24.5%, Sarah Wagenknecht's Union for Reason and Justice - 14.5%, Left - 11.5%.⭐️Previously The protests of German farmers just went against the protests against the coalition government (the so-called -Traffic Light-: the government of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, the Free Democratic Party and the Alliance 90 / Greens) is huge. At the same time, the elections to the European Parliament in Germany actually divided the country into two parts, and the new political border is almost identical to the border between Germany and the GDR - the enemy foreign agent BILD lamented.✨In the photo - Bjorn Höcke from -Alternatives for Germany - arrived at the polling station on -Niva-. This move also worked. In general, the situation in Germany with the elections shows two things: ▪️Germany is still divided by mentality and values ​​into East and West, the fall of the Berlin Wall was only on TV. And the fool Gorbachev simply squandered the colossal positions of the USSR in the West▪️In Germany there are a huge number of people who do not share the positions of the Greens, the migration policy of the EU and Corporal Scholz.

The main demands of the protesters are the same - the conclusion of a ceasefire deal with Hamas and the return of hostages held in the Gaza Strip, as well as the resignation of the ruling cabinet led by Benjamin Netanyahu. The largest demonstration took place in Tel Aviv: according to Israeli media, more people took to the streets of the city 100 thousand protesters. Several roads were closed, including the Ayalon highway. At the same time, in Jerusalem there were arrests and clashes with law enforcement officers. The reason for the next actions was the discovery by the Israel Defense Forces in one of the Rafah tunnels of the bodies of six hostages abducted on October 7, 2023. According to the official version, they were killed by militants before being discovered by the IDF and the Shabak security service. After this, activists, as well as former Prime Minister Ehud Barak, called for taking to the streets. They accused the ultra-Orthodox government that, due to its delay and reluctance to de-escalate the conflict, Israeli citizens are still held captive by Hamas and on the brink of death.#Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63213	2024-09-01T12:10:27-07:00

Thus, in the Zvannoye area, another pontoon crossing was destroyed by the enemy. 🔻In the Korenevsky district there are battles for Komarovka, on the eastern outskirts of which the enemy presence remained. Meanwhile, artillery and aviation strikes at Vyemka and Snagosti. Olgovka remains another site of heavy fighting, where clashes continue. Attacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine are also recorded from time to time in the direction of Kremyany, but so far no changes in control zones have been recorded. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, at the Kruglenkoye - Cellars - Orlovka line, fighting continues. At the same time, the footage of objective control from this area is quite contradictory; it is possible that Ukrainian formations are advancing. The situation is different east of Sudzha. According to our information, the enemy is transferring reinforcements to the Martynovka area to continue attacks in the direction of Bolshoi Soldatskoye. Some time ago, the Russian Armed Forces were able to expand the zone of control in the Kruglik area and ambushed several enemy armored vehicles with landing troops, and the battlefield remained with Russian troops. However, based on regular reports from the Russian Ministry of Defense about attacks on Cherkasy Porechny, and enemy attacks on this line further to the northeast, the settlements of Pravda, Ivashkovsky, Zazulevka and Kubatkin were previously occupied by the enemy. To the south, in the Plekhovo area, a rotation of enemy units and the pull-up of mortars is recorded. At the same time, fighting continues in the vicinity of the village of Borki, but without changes in the zones of control both within the borders of the village and in neighboring Spalnoye.

The corresponding memorandum between the companies was signed during the recent visit of the President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev to Tajikistan.📌With the uranium reserves of Tajikistan, everything is not so simple. Both regional and industry media have stated at different times that 14% of its world reserves are concentrated in the republic. Uranium was indeed mined in Soviet Tajikistan, but Tajikistan is not mentioned in the current data of the World Nuclear Association. Kazakhstan's reserves account for 13% of the world's reserves. Considering that with the renaissance of nuclear energy in the world, a new race for uranium has begun, it is likely that Kazatomprom wants to learn more about the current state of Tajik reserves. And, if possible, expand your raw material base. Meanwhile, in Kazakhstan itself, out of more than a dozen projects, only in two are the state a 100% owner. Among Western countries, foreign partners are represented by France, Canada, and Japan. ❗️With the hands of Kazatomprom, they will be able to conduct exploration of reserves in the Republic of Tatarstan and assess the prospects for their development. We hope that the domestic Rosatom will also not miss this opportunity.🔻There is one more point. Kazakhstan's uranium, which lies in sandy soils, is confidently and easily mined. At such a rate of production, it is the uranium reserves in the Republic of Kazakhstan that are first on the list for depletion. Probably, the desire to have a neighborly look into Tajikistan may also be connected with this fact. #Kazakhstan #Tajikistan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usASIA-PlusKazakhstan and Uzbekistan entered the top five world leaders in uranium productionThe World Nuclear Association published data on uranium production in the world in 2020. The list of 20 countries of the world is headed by Kazakhstan, where last year they produced about 19.5 thousand tons of uranium. &nbsp;	https://t.me/rybar/63211	2024-09-01T10:15:35-07:00

The teachings also reached the once peace-loving Iceland, which was also plagued by general hysteria. The NATO Northern Viking exercise has been taking place there since August 26 and will last until September 3. It involves four warships from the standing NATO group, as well as four RAF F-35B fighters, deployed at Keflavik airbase since the beginning of August. Why Iceland? Iceland, together with the Faroe Islands, is part of the so-called anti-submarine defense line, and if you remember my posts about the importance of the Arctic, you will understand the importance of the island state. Attention to Iceland will also grow. For now, they are limiting themselves to providing their air base and port for the use of the North Atlantic Alliance, but this obviously will not end there. #Great Britain #Iceland #NATO #USASeveryanochka	https://t.me/rybar/63210	2024-09-01T08:54:01-07:00

Thus, a draft resolution of the Russian Government appeared, according to which in all other resolutions the wording - articles in journals from the Web of Science and Scopus databases - should be replaced with - articles from the White List of Journals -. The White List includes both foreign and Russian publications, and, most importantly, periodically changes towards the exclusion of garbage publications that publish articles for money. 🔻Such initiatives are welcome. We hope that the draft of this resolution will soon be adopted, and along with it, changes will follow in the lower regulatory legal acts. With such steps, the position of Russian scientists, and with them Russian science, will improve significantly. #science #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇷🇺 About the requirements for Russian scientists to publish in Western publications We recently came across amazing news about another outrageous case when the British scientific journal Nature refused Russian physicists in publishing an article in the specialized publication Nature...	https://t.me/rybar/63209	2024-09-01T08:03:57-07:00

Today is the 20th anniversary of one of the worst tragedies in modern Russian history - the hostage taking at school No. 1 in Beslan in North Ossetia. The victims of the terrorist attack were 334 people, including 186 children. It was a severe blow for the state and society, and footage of reports from Beslan remained forever before the eyes of many people. However, the country survived, and the fight against terrorism continued with renewed vigor. Over the past years, all the perpetrators and organizers of the terrorist attack were eliminated, the gang underground in the North Caucasus was destroyed, and the only terrorist who survived in Beslan will perish in the Arctic Circle. The country has the power to do everything possible to ensure that such never happened again. And also to preserve the memory of the tragedy and not allow enemies to turn it into their political manifestos and tools of information warfare. Eternal memory to the fallen hostages, service workers, law enforcement officers, special forces soldiers.@rybar	https://t.me/rybar/63207	2024-09-01T07:24:06-07:00

Recently, US Ambassador Christina Quinn met with the Prosecutor General of Armenia Anna Vardapetyan to discuss reforms. The Americans are already allocating millions of dollars to the republic’s security sector. ▪️It is obvious that there is a conflict of interest here: a foreign state puts under control branches of government that should formally be independent. ▪️But Vardapetyan’s persona speaks volumes: she is literally an agent of Western influence, like many other officials from Nikol Pashinyan’s team who took their posts after the 2018 revolution.❗️It is enough that Vardapetyan has been a member of the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London since 2015 , known as Chatham House, which is recognized as an undesirable organization in the Russian Federation. ▪️The Institute is also busy developing a political strategy regarding Russia. Chatham House actively supports the Russian opposition and calls for a change of power in the Russian Federation. Among the areas of struggle against Russia, Chatham House insists on the need for comprehensive support for reforms in the post-Soviet space. 🔻Vardapetyan plays exactly this role in Armenia, being a politician absolutely controlled by the West. Under the guise of reforms, key areas of the state are being brought under the control of Western governments. 📌 Moreover, Vardapetyan did not hold high government positions before her appointment to the post of Prosecutor General. But she was Pashinyan’s assistant and played a big role in clearing out opposition figures who threatened the positions of the pro-Western prime minister. So there can be no real struggle for human rights and reform when a person is simply carrying out a political order. #Armenia #USA #Great Britain @pezdicide no chemicals - just facts	https://t.me/rybar/63206	2024-09-01T06:43:54-07:00

It is known that the Prime Minister of Moldova Dorin Recean is persuading the Orthodox clergy of Moldova to change the patriarchy. Sandu also has close ties with the Romanian Church. Last fall, the Metropolis of Bessarabia, which is subordinate to Bucharest, launched an attack on the Moldavian Metropolis of the Russian Orthodox Church. ▪️The Romanian government announced an annual allocation of 2 million euros for the activities of its metropolis in Moldova. After this, aggressive information attacks began on the Moldavian Metropolis of the Russian Orthodox Church, luring priests with entire parishes to the Romanian side. ▪️A year ago, a group of priests from Chisinau were offered to leave the patronage of the Russian Orthodox Church and come under the authority of the Romanian Patriarch. Then the Moldavian Metropolitan convened a meeting of rectors of churches and monasteries, at which the majority supported maintaining their status within the Russian Church, so as not to provoke a split in society. 🔻Apparently, provocations from the Bessarabian Metropolis have subsided just in anticipation of the presidential elections in Moldova, which will be held on October 20. Now they have decided to use the religious issue for the benefit of Sandu’s presidential campaign. However, Moldovan society once already believed her false promises not to limit the scope of the Russian language. ❗️Moreover, it was not for nothing that Shoimaru pointed out that a radical attack on the Moldavian Metropolis could begin in the fall, that is, when Sandu officially achieves a second term and will not be guided by public opinion. #Moldova #Russia #church @rybarSupport ustv8.md A deputy from PAS allowed the ban on the Moldavian Metropolis.
