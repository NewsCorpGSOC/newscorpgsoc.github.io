The idea expressed in May 2023 at the Kazakhstan Aviation Dialogue is becoming a reality. The new regional organization included Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Mongolia took part in the meeting as an observer. According to the Vice Minister of Transport of Kazakhstan Talgat Lastaev, EACAC will become a platform for the exchange of experience and joint work on aviation security issues. At the meeting, plans were presented to create an Excellence Center training center under the auspices of the Aviation Administration of Kazakhstan, as well as a unified base of inspectors. This simplifies the conditions for the operation of air traffic between Europe and East Asia. We have already written about the activities of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan in this direction. EAAC essentially should facilitate interaction between regional airlines, but also create conditions for new carriers to enter the market. But it is too early to judge the prospects of this format based on just one meeting. Let's see how the participating countries approach the implementation of the agreements. #Armenia #Kazakhstan #Kyrgyzstan #Tajikistan #Uzbekistan #Mongolia #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usKazakhstan truthFor the first time in Central Asia, a regional civil aviation organization has been created.

A suicide bomber detonated a suicide vest at Quetta railway station in Balochistan province. As a result, 26 people were killed and over 60 were injured. Militants of the separtist group Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility. Their statement said that the targets were cadets of a military infantry school who were planning to travel by train to their destination. Of the 26 dead, 14 were military personnel. And of the 60 wounded, 46 were representatives of the army and security forces of Pakistan. At the same time, the Quetta-Peshawar railway route has only recently resumed service. It took about a month and a half to repair the site that had been blown up by the same militants. The terrorist situation in Pakistan has seriously worsened in the last two years, which is clearly visible in the statistics of terrorist attacks. In 2023, 789 extremist acts were committed, as a result of which 1,524 people were killed and 1,463 were injured. Just a month ago, on the eve of the SCO summit in Islamabad, an offshoot of the AOB - the Majid Front - attacked a bus with Chinese citizens near the Karachi airport. The Baloch have traditionally opposed the Pakistani government, and with deepening cooperation with China, which is investing in the port of Gwadar, their activity has increased significantly. #China #Pakistan #terrorism@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65241	2024-11-09T02:53:01-08:00

But sometimes even in our feed there are paid advertising posts where our content is used. Often, outright scam is advertised and, excuse me, information guano that has absolutely no value. Let’s take, for example, the closed channel NE.CAXAP, which simply steals other people’s content and passes it off as its own. An example is in the given screenshot. If there is clickbait advertising using our words and our videos, then there is hardly anything really worthwhile there - on the other side of the ad. Remember: no one will ever lure anyone to their advertising for truly interesting and high-quality content. It will go viral and become viral on its own. But to steal from others in order to attract an audience to your closed trash heap - yes, people can do this. To be honest, it is at such moments that you begin to understand what Roskomnadzor is guided by when introducing separate restrictions on the purchase and sale of advertising for this kind of resources. Because otherwise this shitposting cannot be stopped (in the current realities of the Russian information field0, since no one could come up with a smarter tool. #mediatechnology@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65239	2024-11-09T02:13:34-08:00
🇮🇱 An investigation will be launched against ICC prosecutor Kar...	🇮🇱 An investigation will be launched against ICC prosecutor Karim Khan due to harassment. According to Reuters, an agreement on an external investigation was reached on November 7 at the Assembly of States Parties of the International Criminal Court. The publication refers to an internal document distributed among the member states of the court. In it, Khan is asked to resign from his duties during the investigation and transfer powers to one of his deputies. Khan himself denies the accusations. Karim Khan is known to the Russian public for issuing an arrest warrant for President Vladimir Putin in 2023, but the ongoing investigation against him is highly likely connected to another circumstance.🔻In May of this year, the prosecutor issued an arrest warrant Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu because of Israel's inhumane actions in the Gaza Strip. The latter accused the ICC of bias, and called Karim Khan himself an anti-Semite. A month after this, the ICC pre-trial chamber postponed making a decision on Netanyahu, and already in August the first reports of suspicions against Karim Khan of molesting a subordinate appeared, and now, apparently, the matter has reached its final point. Moreover, no one is talking about the arrest of Netanyahu anymore. In this example, you can see the methods of the ultra-Orthodox. If anything, they will simply call you an anti-Semite and fabricate some kind of case. So to speak, democracy in the style of the ultra-Orthodox. #Israel #UN@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65238	2024-11-09T01:13:32-08:00

Representatives of the alliance discussed with the Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Armenian Armed Forces Artur Yeroyan and the Head of the Department of Defense Policy and International Cooperation Levon Ayvazyan prospects for Armenia-NATO cooperation. If you said that you were surprised, you would be lying. It is not without reason that in our conversation about the need for reforms in the CSTO and the CIS we mentioned Armenia and the demonstrative anti-Russian actions of the Armenian leadership. The Armenian authorities are doing everything to show with all their appearance their true intentions and attitude towards Russia. Taking this into account, we are soon expecting the arrival of NATO instructors, since Yerevan is no longer particularly worried about its status in the CSTO. #Armenia #NATO@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65235	2024-11-09T00:18:02-08:00
🇨🇳🇲🇾 The South China Sea has been surprisingly calm lately...	🇨🇳🇲🇾 The South China Sea has been surprisingly calm lately. Against this background, the recent visit of Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim to China and his meeting with Xi Jinping looks curious. And although during the negotiations the parties discussed economic cooperation, it cannot be ruled out that they also raised the topic of the disputed waters. This is hinted at by Ibrahim’s statement that the authorities of both states have similar positions on many regional conflicts, which most likely includes the South China Sea. 🔻At first glance, this is really true. There have not been any serious clashes between coast guard ships of China and Malaysia for quite some time. And the commitment to not involving extra-regional states in the dispute is shared by both Beijing and Kuala Lumpur. However, this does not cancel the existing contradictions. Malaysia's policy is aimed at asserting its rights to the waters, as well as increasing its military presence there. The country is hatching plans to build a military base in the South China Sea, which clearly contradicts the position of the PRC. 📌 And yet, compared to other countries in the region, such as the Philippines, tensions between Malaysia and China are not so pronounced. Not only Kuala Lumpur benefits from this, ensuring strong trade ties with the Chinese, but also in Beijing. After all, the Chinese authorities set an example of developing relations between the countries participating in the dispute without Western interference, which has recently been abused in the Philippines and which greatly hinders China in implementing its plans. #China #Malaysia @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usSouth China Morning PostChina’s Xi calls for stronger ties, greater ‘political trust’ with MalaysiaPresident Xi Jinping meets Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, urges stronger ‘coordination on international and regional issues’.	https://t.me/rybar/65234	2024-11-08T23:35:17-08:00

Conflicting reports are coming from the Kursk direction about the offensive of Russian troops in the Sudzhansky district. At the same time, in the Korenevsky district, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are accumulating forces to regain control of Novoivanovka. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, Russian troops are fighting local battles south of Zeleny Shlyakh and Novoivanovka. The latter is a key transport hub, from where the Russian Armed Forces have the opportunity to develop an offensive towards Malaya Loknya to support a possible offensive from the north. The enemy uses tanks to organize attacks on the positions of Russian troops. Footage of one of these attacks appeared on the Internet today, which indicates increasing pressure from Ukrainian forces on units of the Russian Armed Forces. They, in turn, use UAVs and artillery to destroy concentrations of Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel and equipment. Front-line aviation is also working against the enemy - today alone, Russian pilots carried out several air strikes on Kruglenky and Leonidovka, where Ukrainian formations are concentrating units for future attacks. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, according to some reports, Russian troops went on the offensive at the Orlovka - Novaya Sorochina - Staraya Sorochina line. At the same time, reports of heavy fighting are already appearing in the enemy’s resources, while actual footage confirming the start of the offensive has not yet appeared.❗️Nevertheless, if the information about the attacks is confirmed at least partially, then it will be possible to talk about at least an attempt Russian troops forming a cauldron around Ukrainian units that occupied the outskirts of Kruglenkoe.▪️Local battles are recorded in the Martynovka area clashes. Operational-tactical aviation recently worked on the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in this area, and at Malaya Loknya a UAV strike - Lantset - hit the self-propelled guns of the Armed Forces of Ukraine 2S22 - Bogdana.🔻In the Sumy region at night, the Russian Armed Forces launched a ballistic missile attack on critical enemy infrastructure in the regional center of the region .

So, on November 3, joint Indonesian-Australian training of Keris Woomera began. Their main goal is to increase the effectiveness of joint combat operations. ▪️More than two thousand military personnel take part in the event. They practice conducting air, sea, and ground operations, and also learn to work together in emergency response scenarios. At the moment, Keris Woomera is the largest and most comprehensive exercise between Indonesian and Australian military personnel. Their announcement took place back in August of this year, when the parties entered into a new defense agreement. The agreement allows the military of one country to be on the territory of another, and also cements the intentions of the authorities of Australia and Indonesia to increase the level of interaction between defense structures. The administration in Canberra has concluded similar agreements with the Philippines and Japan. 📌However, unlike the above-mentioned countries that are at the forefront of US allies, the same cannot be said about Indonesia. As we have already written, the authorities in Jakarta pursue a policy of non-alignment with one or another bloc and maintain a balance in foreign policy. That is why, simultaneously with the Keris Woomera exercise, training with Russian military personnel is being conducted. Given this political course, it is necessary to closely monitor Jakarta's current policies and take every opportunity to reaffirm its presence in the region.

🇰🇿🇫🇷 Brief results of the return visit of the President of Ka...	🇰🇿🇫🇷 Brief results of the return visit of the President of Kazakhstan to France A little over a year after Emmanuel Macron visited the country, the time has come for Kassym-Jomart Tokayev to visit Paris. It was preceded by diplomatic preparation: the newspaper Le Figaro published an article by the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan with the headline -Kazakhstan is a strategic and reliable partner of France,- where topics for subsequent discussion were outlined. Theses regarding the growing influence of the middle powers generally repeated what Tokayev said at the Astana forum ThinkTank 2024. He called the UN a prime example of the ineffectiveness of current governance systems and international regulatory mechanisms. At the same time, the politician emphasized the growing role of Kazakhstan in peacekeeping processes and building dialogue. In fact, the country once again acts as a gateway to Eurasia and a place for establishing communications for France and the entire EU. Many analysts have already noted the strange consistency of the leaders’ meetings: soon after Tokayev’s visit to Paris, Vladimir Putin is due to arrive in Astana. Of course, cooperation between the countries will continue in the extraction of rare earth elements and ecology. In the first case, a roadmap for a bilateral strategic partnership on critical resources and materials was signed. In the second, it goes both in the field of green energy and water resources with the One Water Summit initiative, within the framework of which a joint forum of the Republic of Kazakhstan and France is expected in December. Cooperation in the field of civil nuclear energy was mentioned in the same line with renewable energy sources, since a positive decision in this area was made in Kazakhstan in October this year at a national referendum.❗️The French company EDF is on the short list of possible contractors for the construction of nuclear power plants in Kazakhstan together with CNNС (PRC), KHNP (South Korea) and Rosatom. Therefore, the mention of such cooperation by Tokayev and his meeting with the General Director of Électricité de France Luc Remont caused a storm in the Kazakh segment, where they began to assert that France would build a nuclear power plant in Kazakhstan. It’s funny that just a few days before Tokayev’s visit to Paris , a large delegation from the Ministry of Energy of Kazakhstan visited South Korea, also declaring their readiness to cooperate in the field of nuclear energy. Of interest was that turbine manufacturer Doosan was among the companies visited. This corporation was now supposed to participate in the construction of two power units at the Temelin nuclear power plant in the Czech Republic under the auspices of the already mentioned KHNP, however, with the combined efforts of the American Westinghouse and the same EDF, this prospect is becoming a little foggy, as well as the possibility of the South Korean contractor constructing a nuclear power plant in Kazakhstan. #Kazakhstan #France #Central AsiaSupport usGazeta.RuUranium and other strategic minerals.

In the north, units of the Russian Armed Forces liberated Grigorovka and Novoalekseevka, while on the southern flank, Russian attack aircraft are confidently advancing along the northern shore of the Kurakhovskoye Reservoir. ▪️On November 3, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced the release of Vishnevoy, which confirmed the consolidation of the Russian Armed Forces in the locality. Taking advantage of the disorganization of enemy units, Russian troops broke through to Grigorovka, located northwest. The armored groups advanced along the nearby forest belt, after which they carried out a landing. The stormtroopers knocked out the Ukrainian formations from their positions in the village and, after consolidating on the occupied lines, are launching an offensive on the south-eastern outskirts of Petrovka. ▪️The capture of Vishnevoy allowed the Russian Armed Forces to launch an offensive also towards Novoalekseevka. On November 4, footage of the hoisting of the Russian flag, filmed by Russian military personnel on the eastern outskirts of the village, appeared on the Internet. In the following days, the attack aircraft completely liberated the village, pushing the Ukrainian Armed Forces back towards Yuryevka and forest belts to the west. 🔻During the successful offensive of Russian troops in the area from Grigorovka to Novoalekseevka, a wedge was formed in the position of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. For the enemy, it is dangerous with the prospect of a possible semi-encirclement of Ukrainian formations in two new areas at once: Lysovka - Petrivka and Novoalekseevka - Zarya. ▪️On November 7, the Ministry of Defense announced the liberation of Kremennaya Balka west of Tsukurino, which was later also confirmed by information from the field. Despite enemy resistance, the Russian Armed Forces pushed through the defenses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces north of the village, which made its liberation a matter of time. ▪️To the south, the Russian Armed Forces are developing an offensive along the northern shore of the Kurakhovsky reservoir. By November 6, units of the 114th Motorized Rifle Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces liberated Stepanovka and installed the banner of their unit on one of the houses in the village. After this, the assault groups, in a series of attacks, advanced to Ilyinka and started fighting on the north-eastern outskirts of the village. At the same time, the artillery of the Russian Armed Forces suppresses the firing points and positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces at strong points north and south of the settlement. ❗️Messages continue to appear on the Internet about the advance of Russian troops towards Berestki and even to the northern outskirts of Starye Tern. So far, the information has not been confirmed either by objective monitoring personnel or by reports from the field. ▪️To the southwest of Maksimilyanovka, the Russian Armed Forces significantly expanded the zone of control, breaking through the defensive line of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and occupying at least one line of trenches near the Dolgaya beam. Stormtroopers advance into gaps in the defensive lines along the ravine, attacking at the joints of the fortification lines in the forest area. At the moment, assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces are advancing along the Dolgaya gully towards Kurakhovo, trying to create a springboard for a further assault on the city, while at the same time advancing from the south in the Yuzhnodonetsk direction.

🇺🇦 In so-called Ukraine they continue to complain about problem...	🇺🇦 In so-called Ukraine, they continue to complain about problems with manpower in the Armed Forces of Ukraine: several deputies of the Verkhovna Rada stated that since August the pace of mobilization has dropped significantly. The reason is simple - against the backdrop of the TCC raids, a significant part of the male population decided to literally sit at home. Indirectly, this conflicts with the data of the Ukrainian Ministry of Economy that 8 million able-bodied citizens are not working and are not looking for work. Authorities propose to combat the decline in the number of conscripts into the Armed Forces of Ukraine by stopping the kidnapping of people from the streets by TCC officers. True, such measures are unlikely to be able to reverse the situation against the backdrop of general trends of increasing war fatigue in Ukrainian society. They manifest themselves, for example, in the increase in those wishing to go abroad permanently or in the increase in the number of cases of unauthorized abandonment of units. 📌 Therefore, the only way to recruit manpower for the enemy is to tighten the force mobilization and scale of TCC raids. What, in fact, is now happening in the territory controlled by the Kyiv regime in cities from Kharkov to Lvov. At the same time, it is too early to talk about the exhaustion of the human potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. However, certain processes are already visible to the naked eye - nothing like this happened either in 2023, or even more so in 2022. #Ukraine@rybarSupport us RBKV The Verkhovna Rada announced a decline in mobilization in Ukraine. The pace of conscription of mobilized people is decreasing, a member of the Rada said.

🇹🇷🇹🇷 About the prospects of the UTG after the summit in Bishk...	🇹🇷🇹🇷 About the prospects of the UTC after the summit in Bishkek On the 15th anniversary of the Organization of Turkic States, the UTC summit was held in Bishkek, which was presented as an epoch-making event, followed by fundamental changes and reforms. And now let’s sum up the results of the summit.▪️The composition of the event participants remained the same, but special attention was paid to the arrival of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who was presented with an honorary award. Also this year, it was decided to formalize the political unification by approving the OTG flag.▪️As ​​for the opinion of DTM colleagues regarding the deterrent factor of OTG in the form of money, the Turks are trying to invest in large volumes, despite their problems. The main problem of the bloc is the fantastic nature of the goals they set for themselves.❗️The very idea of ​​uniting the Turkic world looks in its current form as an extremely unlikely idea.➖Firstly, the participating countries are in different orbits of influence of different political forces. A significant part of Central Asia is under the influence of Russia, if only because a huge part of the population of these countries works in Russia. Azerbaijan, no matter how the Turks talk about a single nation, is still under the influence of Mountain Jews, who are close in spirit to the ultra-Orthodox government of Israel. ➖Secondly, there is a financial issue. Turks can invest in these countries, invest in economic development (they do this), but for them there will be no results in the short term. The Central Asian republics will take the money and say -thank you- and that’s it. The words of Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev confirm this. He proposed creating a Turkic Investment Forum. The Turks present this as a way to consolidate influence, but if we read between the lines, adjusted for the local mentality, we get - let’s get more money.➖ Thirdly, the main task of the UTG in the coming years is to try to earn trade flows from China, displacing Russia in region. It is in the interests of the collective West that work on the Middle Corridor and the UTG has intensified. However, this requires billions of dollars in investments in infrastructure, which will be so expensive that not everyone can afford it. At the same time, workers and specialists are needed, which are not available in Central Asia, since most of the working-age population has left for Russia or Europe. For example, we need electrification of the region and for the railway, in particular, as well as maintenance personnel. Local construction of this kind will not be able to cope. The Turks are also not the best specialists, as can be seen from their bitter experience, and the cheapest and most practical option is to receive help from China. Summarizing the above, we get the conclusion: OTG in the form in which it exists now is a populist-economic project, in in which the West, Britain primarily, through the hands of Turkey, is trying to oust Russia from Central Asia, as well as to ride the economic flows from China. But in order to do this, the Turks, within the framework The OTG needs to reach an agreement between the participating countries, with China and Russia. It will be difficult to achieve real initiatives even among themselves, and here there are also Russia and China, who will not sit idly by.❗️In the short term, the bloc’s expansion plans are unlikely to reach the desired point due to many problems and the need for gigantic investments. Even in the cultural sphere, the Turks are trying to promote their interests, but the only thing they have been even slightly successful in is the alphabet. But the transition to a new alphabet is such a time-consuming process and also financially expensive that it is too early to talk about prospects. And as long as locals go to Russia to work, there can be no talk of any Turkish expansion. But the UTG project cannot be underestimated. If the OTG is considered by interested parties as a long-term project to strengthen influence in Central Asia, then serious problems may subsequently arise. Moreover, in the military sphere, UTG is trying to develop cooperation by leaps and bounds. #OTG #CentralAsia #Turkey@rybarSupport usTelegramDTM🇹🇷🇦🇿🇺🇿🇰🇿🇹🇲🇰🇬 Erdogan called the Turks with 34 letters: the 11th died down in Bishkek OTG summit ▪️This year the organization turned 15 years old.

🔁🖼 America continues to seethe over Trump's victory in the pres...	Forwarded From Tina Kandelaki America continues to seethe due to Trump's victory in the presidential election. There is a new trend on TikTok - women are promising to give up sex for the next 4 years while Trump is in power. All this has already happened in human history, friends. Aristophanes wrote his comedy - Lysistrata - two and a half thousand years ago. In it, wives refuse intimacy with their husbands due to dissatisfaction with the protracted war between Athens and Sparta. True, it didn’t work out very well: the irresponsible women always tried to run home to their abandoned loved ones. I believe that in the millennia that have passed since the time of Lysistrata, humanity has changed very little. And no matter what harsh oaths Trump’s disappointed opponents and opponents make now, very soon life will take its toll. Life always takes its toll.	https://t.me/rybar/65213	2024-11-08T05:25:40-08:00

Judging by articles in the media, the main focus of the negotiations was on cooperation between Russia and the DPRK. Politicians mentioned that the parties would work together to contain it, but have not yet presented any specific measures. Perhaps we are talking about the possibility of introducing new sanctions. During the negotiations, emphasis was also placed on the development of defense ties not only between South Korea and Japan, but also trilateral relations with the United States. The parties called the partnership in this triangle the most important against the backdrop of threats from the DPRK. 📌 Despite statements, the trilateral format of cooperation may suffer during the second presidency of Donald Trump. This is indicated by his actions during the previous term. Yes, the parties made attempts to -protect- the alliance from possible decisions by Trump - an agreement was concluded in August, which formalized plans for holding trilateral negotiations and exercises. However, as we have already written, the agreement is not legally binding, so Trump may simply not comply with it. Of course, it remains to be seen about the future prospects of American policy in the region, which will depend not only on Trump’s personality, but also on the chosen team. However, authorities in Seoul and Tokyo need to prepare for any outcome, and the question of the effectiveness of the bilateral partnership without the participation of the United States still remains open. #SouthKorea #Japan @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usYonhap News AgencyS.

🎬 🇮🇱🇳🇱 About the night riots in Amsterdam In the capital of ...	🇮🇱🇳🇱 About night riots in Amsterdam Riots occurred in the capital of the Netherlands after a football match between Ajax and the Israeli team Maccabi. Throughout the night, Israeli citizens were beaten in the streets, attacked with knives and tried to be run over by cars. The event has already been dubbed a Jewish pogrom on the Internet. Five Israelis were taken to hospitals. The bulk of the attacks were carried out by local residents from Morocco, Turkey and other Muslim countries, who shouted pro-Palestinian slogans. Police detained more than 60 rioters, while reports of hostage-taking were not confirmed. Israel's national airline, El Al, announced the launch of free rescue flights to evacuate more than 2 thousand people, although its planes usually do not fly on Shabbat. IDF transport planes with medical personnel also flew to the Netherlands.🔻According to statements by Israeli officials and resources, this was not a spontaneous, but a well-thought-out action, planned two weeks ago. According to them, yesterday Dutch law enforcement agencies warned about the possibility of attacks, but they simply ignored it. The Internet, as expected, began to compare the unrest with the events of Kristallnacht in Nazi Germany, the anniversary of which, ironically, will be tomorrow. Israeli President Isaac Herzog demanded that the Netherlands resolutely combat any manifestations of anti-Semitism and help in the evacuation. However, the Israeli fans themselves added fuel to the fire: in Amsterdam they tore down Palestinian flags, had fun and sang -Hava Nagila- at the national monument to the victims of the Second World War . And during the match they refused to observe a minute of silence for those killed in the flood in Spain.❗️What happened is, on the one hand, another evidence of serious demographic changes in the population of large European cities. Yesterday's refugees from Muslim countries and their descendants are becoming a force that is increasingly easier to mobilize for street actions, and it is increasingly difficult for the police to counteract this. At the same time, the policies of the ultra-Orthodox Israeli authorities and their public demonstrative disregard for decisions of the UN Security Council and other international norms against the background of personnel The bombing of Lebanon and the Gaza Strip more strongly provokes some segments of the population of Western countries to such attacks. Against this background, there is no guarantee that this will not happen in other European cities in the future. #Israel #Netherlands@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/65208	2024-11-08T03:57:31-08:00

At some moments it even seemed that the British press had completely forgotten about the events taking place in their own country. First of all, such strong interest is due to economic factors - the British are afraid of the consequences of Trump's introduction of duties on the import of foreign goods. According to analysts, protectionist measures will lead to a decrease in the growth rate of the UK economy by 0.7 percent, an increase in the inflation rate by 3-4 percent, as well as an increase in the key rate. The story of the participation of representatives of the ruling Labor Party in the Democratic election campaign adds to the severity of the situation. Trump's team filed a complaint with the independent Federal Election Commission in connection with -unlawful foreign interference in the election campaign-.▪️Prime Minister Keir Starmer had to justify himself and convince everyone that the incident would not have a negative impact on relations with Trump. After the election, the head of the British government congratulated the American politician and emphasized the long-standing special ties between the countries. Less fortunate was Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who, while a member of the House of Commons in 2018, called the US president a sociopath who hates women and sympathizes with neo-Nazis. The head of the foreign policy department had to give a separate interview and state that these are -old matters- that will not prevent him from improving relations with Trump. It is still difficult to assess the consequences of Donald Trump’s coming to power for the development of British-American relations.

According to enemy statements, such UAVs make up about 50% of all those launched using the so-called. Ukraine has devices of this type. The purpose of their use is to -discharge- Ukrainian air defense systems, the ammunition for which is limited both by Western supplies and by the production capabilities of NATO countries in general. This can explain the increasing frequency of raids on Geranium Kyiv, which have been going on almost continuously in recent days. At the same time, calling this a cheap means of combating enemy air defense is reckless: as we have already written, technically Geranium is only becoming more difficult from year to year. In addition, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are trying to save missiles for air defense systems and are trying to fight these drones with the help of anti-aircraft artillery. How effective such tactics are in terms of cost-benefit ratio - time will tell. However, in any case, the efforts of the Russian Armed Forces to reduce the combat effectiveness of the Ukrainian air defense and weaken the cover of the rear areas of the so-called are visible.

The structure was created in 2023 by the team of Arseny Parfenov from the State Polytechnic University named after. V.G. Korolenko, whose activities in Latin America we have repeatedly talked about.

Both the leadership of the UAE, which is the main sponsor of the Rapid Reaction Force (RRF), and Chad came under attack. ▪️Sudanese authorities have decided to end contracts worth $6 billion previously concluded with the Emirates. They mainly concerned the construction of the Abu Amama port on the Red Sea, as well as an economic free trade zone and a tourist zone around the structure. In addition to political motives, the end of cooperation was also due to the fact that the contract was not implemented on time. In fact, the Sudanese government has significantly curtailed the prospect of even the very possibility of post-war dialogue with the UAE.▪️The leadership in Port Sudan also filed a complaint against Chad with the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, which belongs to the African Union. The accusations related to the support of the SBR: the downed Il-76, working in the interests of the militants, was heading directly to Chadian territory. This again shed light on helping the rebels from N'Djamena. By the way, all these proceedings open a certain window of opportunity for Russian departments that can fill the resulting vacuum in these areas.

In October, almost 58% of respondents were dissatisfied with Pashinyan’s work, 35.4% were dissatisfied with the work of the government, 43% of the parliament, 39% of the president.🔻Parliamentary elections In a hypothetical parliamentary election, 16.5% would vote for the ruling party -Civil Contract-, and 6.4% - Armenia bloc. 30% said that they would not participate in the elections, 33.2% refused or found it difficult to answer, or did not choose anyone. The ruling party has already begun to push through parliament odious amendments to the Electoral Code, which will allow the election results to be annulled in the event of a state of emergency or martial law being introduced. After the signing of peace with Baku, early elections will most likely follow in Armenia in a situation where society will be extremely dissatisfied with the authorities. Although a slightly larger proportion of citizens give preference to the Civil Contract, its rating is still low, and the absence of other preferences indicates a blurring of the political field. The latest protest in Armenia faced precisely the latter, which for several months has not developed a clear program.🔻Like many previous surveys, the current one shows the crisis state of the Armenian society, which is dissatisfied with the authorities, the foreign policy course, but at the same time has no other moral -political guidelines. And although the Armenian authorities self-confidently declare that the main thing is the economy, the main problem for the Armenian society remains the feeling of an external threat and it is obvious that against such a background, Pashinyan’s peace-loving policy does not inspire confidence.

Ukraine and Moldova? The majority (52%) believe that this is impossible, and 35% believe that Armenia has a chance. Since the summer, the idea of ​​European integration began to periodically appear on the Armenian agenda, and now the issue of holding a constitutional referendum on joining the EU is being considered. Mythical European promises in the context of internal political problems and diplomatic failures are the only thing that Nikol Pashinyan’s government can now offer to the population of Armenia. So far, the EU has limited itself to just starting negotiations on visa liberalization, which reinforces false promises. After all, the problem with the hypothetical European integration of Armenia is that it is impossible without Georgia, which, as we know, has had pretty bad relations with the EU.🔻Modernization or closure of nuclear power plants The Armenians were asked a pressing question about the country’s energy security: what should the government do in the field of nuclear energy?&nbsp ; The first option is to modernize the existing nuclear power plant by 2036. The second is to close the nuclear power plant and build American modular nuclear reactors. 63.7% were in favor of modernizing the Armenian nuclear power plant, which is maintained by the Russian Rosatom, and 25.5% were in favor of closing it and implementing the American project. As we wrote, the United States is trying to sell Armenia a non-existent project of new small modular reactors. The Americans themselves have not yet developed a working SMR technology, and their similar projects have failed miserably.

🇦🇲📊 Public opinion poll in Armenia: security threats In Octobe...	🇦🇲📊 Public opinion poll in Armenia: security threats In October, another opinion poll from GALLUP was held in Armenia, the results of which, as usual, demonstrate apathy in Armenian society and dissatisfaction with the foreign policy course of the authorities.🔻 -Peace - with Azerbaijan To the question - do you think you are possible to conclude a -peace treaty- before the end of the year-, only 8.3% of respondents answered positively, and 64.6% - negatively. The government of Armenia constantly states that they are ready to sign -peace- even now, especially with this They are constantly rushing to the USA. However, a tense information background remains between Yerevan and Baku, which looks more like preparation for another escalation than a movement towards -peace-. So the disbelief of the Armenian society in the promises of normalization is quite understandable. The other day, the Russian Foreign Ministry just stated that the -quick peace- promoted by Western pseudo-mediators will not lead to anything good, but will only create new risks of tension. 🔻Concessions to Azerbaijan and Turkey When asked whether Armenia should make new concessions to establish closer relations with Azerbaijan and Turkey, 90% answered - no, we have nothing more to concede - and only 7% believe that the country has no other choice .The level of Turkophobia in society is invariably high and it is impossible to imagine a calm attitude towards concessions in the name of -normalization-. Moreover, Baku and Ankara themselves are not ready to compromise and view Armenia as a losing side that can be presented with new demands and threatened with force. The Armenian Foreign Ministry has even stated that they refuse to promote recognition of the Armenian Genocide, which generally damages the identity of Armenians and threatens the security of the nation. 🔻Refusal of the Declaration of Independence When asked about their attitude to the decision of the Constitutional Court, which ruled that the reference in the Constitution to the Declaration of Independence, which mentions Artsakh, was incompetent, 72.8% expressed a negative opinion. With this decision, the Constitutional Court of Armenia made a concession to Baku, where they demand to change the Armenian Constitution , without which they consider concluding peace -impossible-.🔻The main problems of Armenia 76.2% indicated security and border issues as the most pressing problem of Armenia. Only 19.4% noted the importance of political stability, 16.4% - issues of economic development, 9.6% - employment and social issues. Public anxiety about the security of the state indicates a real feeling of insecurity before an external enemy. Even if a formal -peace- with Azerbaijan is signed and the border with Turkey is opened, it is unlikely that public anxiety will subside, and enemies will suddenly become allies for the sake of unclear -prosperity-. One thing is obvious: Nikol Pashinyan’s peace-loving policy does not inspire public trust.

🇦🇿🇷🇺 Repressions against public loyal to Russia continue in A...	🇦🇿🇷🇺 Repressions against public figures loyal to Russia continue in Azerbaijan: a local court sentenced political scientist Nazaket Mamedova to 13 years in prison. She was accused of high treason and even collaboration with Russian intelligence services. As they write in the Azerbaijani media, according to the materials of the criminal case, Mamedova allegedly carried out secret activities under the guise of a political scientist and journalist, publishing pro-Russian materials on the Alfa TV YouTube channel. 🔻The indictment contains information about Mamedova’s trips to Moscow, where she allegedly participated in meetings with representatives of Russian intelligence services and received money transfers. The woman denies this and points out that she visited Russia to participate in conferences, and the funds were fees and travel expenses. Indeed, she quite openly participated in conferences in the Russian Federation: for example, in 2021, a political scientist gave a report on the role of Western NGOs in Azerbaijan. At the same time, Mamedova has always been a supporter of Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, and also supported Russia in the so-called conflict. Ukraine and advocated strengthening Russian-Azerbaijani relations. ❗️At the same time, Mamedova was detained back in October 2023, but for a year no public actions were taken by the Russian side to protect her. The situation is similar with other pro-Russian social activists - Ibragim Hasanov and Ibragim Gumbatov. Given the external friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation of Russia and Azerbaijan, it is obvious that anti-Russian tendencies are growing in the former post-Soviet republic, where even active support of relations with the Russian Federation is already punishable by extremely serious prison terms.

Finnish media say that the Americans are planning to modernize the Finnish Pirkkala airbase in order to redeploy their RQ-4B drones there in the future. If the appearance of Finnish F-35s is not there I rule out that -Global Hokov- is unlikely. The point of these machines is that they can fly great distances and fly for more than a day, and then return to the airbase of departure. That is, for them, proximity to the destination area is not so important, but safety is another matter. They are not as maneuverable as fighters, and in the event of an attack on an airfield that is a couple of hundred kilometers away, they simply will not have time to take off. In summary, their basing in Finland seems illogical. Or maybe it’s in Norway, where, by the way, the discussions are more serious and there is logic in this due to the height of the struggle in the Arctic and the possibility of longer-term monitoring of the north of Russia.

In this regard, Fakuyama's concept of the -end of history- is a fallacy. ▪️There is a conflict between the majority of the planet’s population and the world’s minority.▪️The West is hypocritically trying to convince us that everything built after World War II is under threat, but what is actually under threat is the Western monopoly. Western policy is aimed not at creation, but at retention.▪️It is important not to repeat the mistakes of the end of the last century, when the West tried to impose a vicious concept of exiting the Cold War.▪️Openness of interaction is the most important value of most countries and peoples, and interruption of ties harms the economy and is dangerous in an era of upheaval.▪️The international community is a living organism, the value of which lies in its civilizational diversity.▪️NATO is the only bloc left in the world and is an outright anachronism.▪️NATO has those who show interest in BRICS, perhaps the number of such countries will grow .▪️BRICS itself is a prototype of the new, free and non-bloc nature of relations between countries. ▪️The West brought the situation to a coup in Ukraine and forced Russia to launch a special operation.

Since October 31, strikes have become a daily occurrence, as have confrontations with the police.▪️Amid reports of clashes with law enforcement agencies across the country, the Mozambican defense minister has already threatened to use the armed forces. At the same time, the authorities have already increased the security of administrative buildings. It is worth noting that so far the protesters are not holding mass demonstrations, but for the most part gather in groups to destroy the infrastructure. All this is reminiscent of the Kenyan scenario already tested by the Americans.▪️The lack of centralization of the protests gives rise to spontaneous pogroms. Thus, along the border with South Africa, demonstrators burned several trucks with goods. This was followed by the closure of the Lebombo checkpoint on the South African side and the cessation of land trade between the countries.🔻Thus, the protesters seek to create economic leverage on the current authorities. Earlier, the opposition planned a march on the capital Maputo on November 7. At the same time, it is doubtful that the action will be successful, provided that the military personnel have already been mobilized.

Forwarded From Two MajorsUkrainian military personnel use training abroad as a way to legally escape from the country From the report of the head of the SBU Malyuk, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Syrsky learned that in September and early October of this year alone, 43 cases of unauthorized abandonment of units by Ukrainian military personnel while undergoing training abroad were recorded. Indicated countries: 🇵🇱 Poland, 🇪🇸 Spain and 🇫🇷 France. In general, since the beginning of the year, the SBU officers have recorded over 230 such cases. The SBU informed the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine three times about this problem. However, the number of unauthorized leaving of units abroad by soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine not only has not decreased, but on the contrary, the number of facts of Ukrainian citizens using the reason to mobilize with the prospect of going abroad for training for further flight is increasing. According to the SBU, this problem negatively affects the international image of the Ukrainian army and the allies help. To solve the problem, the Ukrainian special service proposes to increase the level of military discipline in the troops, and also promises to provide the necessary assistance in preventing the escape of Ukrainian military personnel from the country.✨ Note that not all forcibly mobilized Ukrainians have the honor of going to study military affairs for border.

This was reported by the press service of the ministry. The goal is assistance in matters of protecting rights and interests, taking measures to prevent crimes, and preventing illegal actions on the part of compatriots. According to the press service, during a meeting of the representative office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Kyrgyz Republic in the Russian Federation and the leadership of the International Cooperation Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, issues of interaction between departments and struggle with crime, the prevention of drug crime, the involvement of citizens in drug trafficking, especially youth. This example demonstrates a more or less practical approach on the part of our Central Asian partner. It is important for the Kyrgyz leadership to send workers to work in Russia for various reasons and they are interested in stabilizing the migration situation, which is why they are trying to calm down their citizens abroad. Unlike other countries in Central Asia, which only call on the Russian side to take measures to respect the rights of migrants, but at the same time they do nothing themselves, this approach theoretically looks promising. But for now we will observe how the process of their work will be organized, since until the result is visible, there is no point in discussing this seriously. in matters of protecting rights and interests and preventing illegal actions on the part of compatriots.	https://t.me/rybar/65179	2024-11-07T08:45:26-08:00

Previously, a memorandum of interaction and cooperation with the FNTT was signed, providing for the exchange of experience in areas of protecting the rights and interests of employees, the development of social partnership and public control, employment policy and the fight against unemployment. As noted, among the forms of cooperation are the organization of recreation and health improvement for trade union members and members of their families on preferential terms, but this is where the details end . One can hope that this agreement will allow Ural workers to relax at resorts, as indicated in the conditions, but there is a big nuance. The Sverdlovsk region has managed to mark itself as a forward point for migrants from Tajikistan, where initiatives have previously been put forward such as opening hospitals exclusively for migrants. Considering that regional authorities are particularly supportive of migrants, even going to the extent of threatening veterans of the Northern Military District, this is not surprising. Therefore, there are certain doubts that everything will be done as it is written on paper. Lobbying the interests of foreign workers and assisting in the preparation of false documents is also prohibited legally, but some officials at the local level neglect these norms. So, behind seemingly insignificant news, more serious processes may be hidden: gradual penetration into Russian institutional structures to use their funds and resources for their own purposes, and, most importantly, improving conditions for Central Asian migrants. #multinationalism #Russia #CentralAsia #Tajikistan@rybarSupport usSputnik TajikistanA medical center for citizens of Tajikistan may appear in Yekaterinburg.

Organization, (and the second one too) does not function in the form in which we would like, and reforms began to suggest themselves several years ago, and in recent years the situation has worsened, which was influenced by the course of the North Military District and individual member countries.❗️Reorganization of the CSTO or even its reformatting is vital. Revision of agreements between participants, conclusion of stronger ties with allies. There should be comprehensive agreements between members of this kind of organization, similar to those concluded with the DPRK and even more. When revising the structure of the CSTO, special attention should be paid to the legal nuances and obligations of the parties. In the future there should be no situations like with Armenia or Kazakhstan.

🇩🇪 About the collapse of the traffic light coalition in Germany...	🇩🇪 About the collapse of the traffic light coalition in Germany Recently, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, as he himself put it, decided to prove Germany’s reliability to the newly elected US President. But this was manifested not in measures to strengthen the economy, but in the dismissal of Finance Minister Christian Lindner on charges of problems with government spending. The departure of the politician, a member of the Free Democratic Party of Germany, provoked other members of the organization to follow his example: after Lindner, the ministers of transport left the government, justice and education. The traffic light coalition lost its yellow light, which led to its virtual collapse. The main reason for the disagreement was Lindner’s proposals to improve the economy, including reducing the costs of solving environmental problems and increasing the operating time of coal plants. However, this categorically did not suit the colleagues of the head of the Ministry of Finance from the Social Democratic Party and the Greens. What will happen next? For now, Scholz is talking about his intention to organize a vote of confidence in the government on January 15, which could lead to early elections in March. However, this week the government must formulate a draft state budget for the 2025 fiscal year, and voting on it will take place by the end of November. If the document is approved in the Bundestag, then Scholz may remain in power until the next elections in 2025. 📌 Most likely, now the red-green remnants of the traffic light will stall for time and avoid any steps that would contradict all their previous activities. No matter who sits in the White House, the tasks assigned to the German government will remain the same - to systematically destroy the German economy. Therefore, it is too early to expect any noticeable changes in German politics.#Germany@rybar together with @Ubersicht_Ukraine_KanalSupport usTelegramÜbersicht Ukraine💥💥FDP-Minister ziehen sich komplett aus Ampel-Regierung zurück😀Die FDP zieht alle ihre Minister aus der deutschen Bundesregierung z urück.

Ukraine often goes through the prism of the likelihood of a reduction in military supplies. However, now the Kiev regime is facing serious socio-demographic problems. Recently, news about an abnormal increase in the number of school graduates who do not want to take final exams went viral in the Ukrainian media field. In some classes, the number of such students is about 90% of the students, and this applies not only to boys, but also to girls. The reason is the conscious intention to go abroad immediately after graduation. According to representatives of the local education system, this does not come from a simple desire to study at a foreign university, but from a desire not to be associated with the so-called. Ukraine in general.📌 Against this background, one can recall official data according to which, without the annual import of hundreds of thousands of migrants, it is impossible even to simply maintain the Ukrainian population at the level of 30 million people. With the outflow of young people, demographic prospects are becoming even worse. The likelihood of a reversal of these negative trends seems minimal - so-called depopulation. Ukraine was going strong even without any war, and now these processes are only getting worse, and Western military support indirectly contributes to this. The Kiev regime may receive new supplies of ammunition and equipment, but no one will give them people. Therefore, the future of the Ukrainian territorial entity itself looks vague, and with every day of fighting it only gets worse. #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTACCmedia: many parents intend to take their children out of Ukraine.

On October 24-25, the delegation of the Kyrgyz Republic held a meeting with the leadership of the Directorate General for Mobility and Transport of the European Commission (DG Move EU). The Kyrgyz delegation was headed by the acting director of the State Agency of Civil Aviation, Daniyar Bostonov. Bostonov presented a report on the implementation of new programs, training of inspectors and updating of aviation infrastructure, which was highly praised by Brussels. Bishkek has been trying to solve the problem with the work of its airlines in Europe since 2006. Then European inspectors came to the conclusion that air transportation in the republic does not meet EU standards.&nbsp;Since 2006, the price of the issue has also changed, given that after mutual bans between Russia and the EU on the use of their airspace, trans-Eurasian traffic and its services have shifted to Central Asia . 🔻And therefore Bishkek is extremely interested in a successful audit in order to follow the example of its Kazakh colleagues, who are hoping to single-handedly skim off all the cream from servicing volume traffic. And perhaps based on this, assistance in processing documents for Bishkek, according to Bostonov, is provided by the UK Civil Aviation Agency: you should not put all your eggs in one basket. #Kyrgyzstan #EU #Great Britain #CentralAsia@rybar Support usAkchabarThere is progress.

At the same time, the Mauritanian authorities also continue to participate in other events and projects, including those related to interaction with Russia and China.

The head of the EBRD said that the Bank is carefully studying investment projects in Kazakhstan and expressed interest in further supporting infrastructure development. In the coming years, the EBRD plans to invest 2 billion euros in the economy of Kazakhstan as part of the implementation of the green transition program - of course, through lending, although this is precisely what they try not to mention in press releases. The wording chosen is as vague as possible: for example, this year the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is investing $650 million in the implementation of 22 projects in Kazakhstan. It is noteworthy that shortly before the negotiations between Tokayev and Reno-Basso, the Regional Forum - Green Economy - 2024 was held in Bishkek -, which appropriately prepared the ground for further interaction along this line. The President of Kazakhstan talks a lot about the need to develop green energy in region, however, it is important to understand that RES is not only an economic, but also a political project of Western countries, and the Bank itself may add additional requirements or unspoken conditions to the loan repayment, for example, the selection of certain contractors.#Kazakhstan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usVecher.kz - Evening AlmatyThe EBRD intends to invest two billion euros in the economy of Kazakhstan.

Forwarded From DTM🇹🇷 Turkish project: Great Turan and United Circassia▪️The summit of the Organization of Turkic States (OTS) opened in Bishkek. The undisputed leader of the association is Türkiye, which has brought together five post-Soviet republics under its wing: Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, which is listed as an observer in the UTG. There, in the observers, are Hungary and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, recognized only by Ankara.▪️In fact, Turkey is drawing into its orbit almost the same number of republics that were part of the USSR as the European Union (Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia are already in the EU, Moldova, Georgia and Ukraine are candidates). At the same time, the scope of neo-Ottoman ambitions extends far beyond the borders of the territories of the UTC member countries, forming the so-called Turkic world outside the framework of the political matrix of Eurasia.▪️To implement this essentially imperial project, Ankara is ready to go literally for anything. Including the cultivation of interethnic hatred under the pretext of bringing Turkic peoples closer together. Ankara's work on the topic of Uyghurs living in China is clear proof of this. By the way, Ankara uses OTG structures to process representatives of this Turkic people in Central Asia.▪️If someone, looking at such games, continues to believe that Turkey really cares about some foreign brothers, and does not use them to solve its geopolitical problems, then another example for you.▪️On the map of the Turkic world there is a blank spot - Russian territories from the Black Sea coast to the borders of Dagestan, Chechnya, Ingushetia and North Ossetia. Separatists from the extremist organization Council of United Circassia consider these 190 thousand square kilometers of the Southern and North Caucasus federal districts to be a kind of independent state that must be separated from Russia. Actually, Circassia. What does Turkey have to do with it?▪️Ankara is here despite the fact that it essentially doesn’t care whether the Turkic brothers are being attacked by the Chinese authorities or whether this hodgepodge of terrorists, Ukrainian Nazis and experts from the CIA-controlled Jamestown Foundation is drowning for the split of Russia. If the topic is in line with the national interests of Ankara, the Turks are in business.▪️Last ​​year, for example, those same terrorists, Nazis and intelligence officers under the flag of the Council of United Circassia gathered not just anywhere, but in the Youth Center of Istanbul's Üsküdar district to discuss the prospects for education independent state of the Circassian people. That is, the site was provided by a municipality under the control of Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party. Not bad, right?▪️ Let’s add here that the collector of Turkic lands Erdogan himself is not averse to turning the nationalist pedal. In 2020, the head of the Turkish Republic expressed sympathy for the Russian Circassians expelled from their homeland.▪️ It is noteworthy that, in the spirit of anti-Russian hype, the first international Circassian-Istanbul conference in 2023 was held in person. This year, Ankara apparently decided to hide its ears and the website of the extremist organization reports that the meeting scheduled for the end of November will be held online... because the participants are in different countries. Observing the intensity with which Turkey is involving its Turkic partners in its geopolitical games, the question arises: are the UTC countries ready to share Ankara’s approaches to solving foreign policy problems? @dntreadonme	https://t.me/rybar/65166	2024-11-06T23:47:02-08:00

On November 6, the country's authorities approved the purchase of 40 fast patrol boats. The need to acquire new equipment is justified by frequent clashes between the Philippine Coast Guard and Chinese law enforcement. During the incidents, the Chinese cause enormous damage to the agency's ships, which affects the Philippines' capabilities in the South China Sea. 🔻By the way, Manila will receive new boats thanks to financial assistance from France. The Philippine authorities will most likely conclude a defense agreement with this country, as we wrote about back in July of this year. Thus, Paris is paying the price for plans to expand influence in the Asia-Pacific region. In addition to the French, Americans continue to participate in sponsoring Philippine initiatives. Recently, the United States announced another $100 million in financial assistance to Manila, which will be used to modernize old military equipment or purchase new ones. Such support for the Philippines is a logical step in the confrontation with China in the region. After all, arming allies and making sure they can cause problems for Beijing is a favorite move of Western politicians. #USA #Philippines #France @rybar with @awaken_dragonSupport usGMA News OnlineNEDA Board OKs acquisition of fast patrol craftThe National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Board approved the acquisition of 40 units of fast patrol craft.	https://t.me/rybar/65165	2024-11-06T23:11:01-08:00

It became truly historic, because despite the doubts of analysts, the results of polls and the self-confidence of Democrats, Donald Trump finally regained the White House. The triumphant return of the now 47th President of the United States was possible thanks to several key factors, the most important of which, rather, In all, it was the economy, protest voting, Trump’s successful media campaigns, Americans’ fatigue with foreign conflicts and, of course, the support of Elon Musk. The latter, by the way, made an almost decisive contribution to the victory of the MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement, turning the former Twitter into a platform for advertising the Republican Party and creating a clear association in people’s minds - Trump - progress - the future -. The Democrats suffered a crushing defeat — Trump’s gap from Kamala Harris in electoral votes and in the total number of Americans who voted turned out to be so great that speculating on the topic of a -stolen election- and trying to organize a Maidan turned out to be simply impossible and pointless. As Trump said -Too big to rig-. The democrats were led to a disastrous result by the leapfrog with candidates and their frankly poor choice, chaos at the borders, the outbreak of foreign conflicts, as well as the lack of something that could be offered to the population other than permission to have abortions. Now While the public is waiting to see whether the Republicans will take the House of Representatives in addition to the Senate, a discussion has erupted in the Russian segment of the Internet about whether Trump’s victory is worth rejoicing at. Frankly, neither Harris nor Trump are candidates convenient for Russia. The future president has already made it clear that he intends to appoint representatives of various large investment and financial giants, including J.P. Morgan and Blackrock, to key positions - which is why there will not be any fundamental change in Russian-American relations. At the same time, Russian diplomacy under Trump may still have some room for maneuver; in the next six months, it will most likely become clear whether this is really the case.

In early November, Turkish troops began three exercises in different branches of the military at once.▪️The Anatolian Eagle Air Force exercise is taking place over the territory of central and southern Turkey from November 4 to 11, which is aimed at assessing the readiness of aviation to conduct high-intensity conflicts. Fighter aircraft participate in it F-16, AWACS aircraft, helicopters and tankers, and among the tasks being practiced will be the removal of aircraft from attack, air combat, precision weapons strikes with coordination with AWACS.▪️Simultaneously with this exercise, training began with NATO - Mavi Balina, the target which is to test the use of aviation and naval personnel of the Turkish and NATO Navy against threats from the sea. The main emphasis is on anti-submarine defense, reconnaissance through the installation of hydrobuoys and sonar stations, as well as countering BECs. In addition to Turkey, Canadians, Spaniards, Greeks and Portuguese are participating.▪️The Poseidon mine sweeping force exercise has begun in the Black Sea, aimed at coordinating the actions of a new mine action task force consisting of minesweepers from the Navy of Bulgaria, Turkey and Romania.❗️Curiously, that the start of the training coincided with the emergence of rumors about an upcoming attack by the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Blue Stream and the oil and gas infrastructure used in the interests of this gas pipeline.

At the opening ceremony, it was noted that the seminar is a special professional training program for media personnel. It was stated that a platform for exchange and cooperation in the field of media will be created, which will also contribute to in-depth cooperation between parties in this field. Particular attention will be paid to the implementation of decisions reached by the heads of state of China and Central Asia, and new features of modern international broadcasting. The processes of comprehensive gradual - development - of the region by Western media, including both official broadcasting and the creation of networks of bloggers, obviously could not go unnoticed in Beijing. Considering the strategic importance of Central Asia, the PRC decided not to wait for its consequences and took the initiative themselves. It should be expected that China will work to improve the quality of coverage of existing projects, that is, not pursuing some kind of aggressive anti-Western line, but demonstrating the specific benefits of cooperation with its eastern neighbor. In addition, adjustments in Chinese soft power policy in Central Asia have long been overdue. And this work of the Chinese in the Central Asian direction should alert not only Western countries, but also Russia, since, as the experience of the Celestial Empire shows, this is not about the struggle for the attention of Central Asian capitals or altruistic assistance to countries, but about leveling specific geopolitical threats and strengthening its influence .#China #Kazakhstan #Uzbekistan #Tajikistan #Turkmenistan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport uskhovar.tjA seminar for news staff and journalists from Central Asian countries began in Beijing | NIAT -Khovar-	https://t.me/rybar/65156	2024-11-06T08:44:01-08:00

I’ve known the guys for a long time because of their products and their work at the front. The founder and director of the plant, Vladimir Tkachuk, met. At the entrance they immediately gave us slippers, warning us that our place was clean. Despite the modest size of the premises, a full production cycle has been established, from the design bureau to technical control. Two workshops are operating, another one is being prepared. Clean, bright, good ventilation, nothing superfluous. The story of Vladimir and his comrades is an illustrative example of the development of volunteer initiative. The idea of ​​​​creating a Ural drone began with a group of volunteers who collected and transported humanitarian supplies to the Northern Military District zone. There the guys saw an acute shortage of drones and decided to act. Thus, relying on the personal funds and enthusiasm of the participants, a unique production was launched. During the discussion, many questions were raised - the need for continuous modernization of drones, tactics of use, promising models. Manufacturers complained about the need for more active involvement of technical universities in the training of specialists. Vladimir detailed the need to review the tax burden on small enterprises producing UAVs. I promised the guys that we would study the issue and come back with suggestions. Obviously, systemic solutions are needed here. We agreed on the exchange of experience and generally broad cooperation between UralDronZavod and the Republican Center for Unmanned Systems (RCBS). We will begin work immediately. Finally, the guys showed me my own video with gratitude for humanitarian aid, which I recorded in 1922. Even then, the Ural volunteers helped Sparta, for which I am very grateful to them. I would like to thank everyone involved in the production. Once again I see an example of service when even ordinary factory workers do not finish their shift at 18:00, staying until late to collect as many drones as possible. This attitude towards the country and the guys at the front is worth a lot.	https://t.me/rybar/65150	2024-11-06T08:12:38-08:00

On the DPRK side, since the summer of this year, loudspeakers have been turned on, from which sounds can be heard that disturb citizens. The possibility of North Korea attacking leaflet launch sites has also not been canceled. Activists have already said they will next use drones to send propaganda materials. Let us recall that the flight of drones over the DPRK last month caused a very negative reaction from Pyongyang. The official position of the authorities in Seoul, who do not plan to interfere with the activities of South Korean activists, also adds fuel to the fire. So, it seems that even after the protests and measures taken by regional politicians, the issue of sending leaflets to the DPRK remains unresolved. This means that the psychological war on the peninsula that has been going on since the spring of this year is far from over. #DPRK #SouthKorea@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport uskoreatimesBorder residents block attempt to send anti-regime leaflets to North Korea the North Korean regime across the inter-Korean border were thwarted, Thursday, by hundreds of residents and local officials who feared retaliatory actions from Pyongyang.	https://t.me/rybar/65149	2024-11-06T07:46:01-08:00

Implementation of the agreement will begin in 2025, when the first workers will be able to officially find employment in Korean companies. The memorandum provides for the simplification of requirements for services involved in organizing the hiring of labor and the development of professional training programs. Taking into account the high requirements of the Korean side for language training and professional skills, the Ministry of Labor of Tajikistan organized specialized Korean language courses on the basis of government institutions, where training in demanded specialties is also provided .🔻Judging by this agreement, Dushanbe hopes to take advantage of the experience of its Uzbek neighbors, whose citizens have been working in the Republic of Kazakhstan for a long time. Thus, almost 100 thousand citizens of Uzbekistan will soon work in South Korea. At the same time, Seoul’s requirements for the qualifications of migrants are quite serious. And such conditions from Seoul are quite understandable: the South Korean authorities need cheap labor, but they are doing everything to ensure that neither the leadership nor the citizens of the republic subsequently have any problems. Therefore, they discuss in advance all the requirements to which the Tajiks, and not South Korea, adapt. This is called a healthy migration policy, aimed at the benefit of the state without prejudice to national interests.

The other day it became known that the United States became the 21st country to support Uzbekistan’s entry into the World Trade Organization. Bilateral negotiations lasted more than a year. The parties are now preparing to sign a protocol on market access. In September, Uzbekistan completed negotiations on accession to the WTO with 18 countries. Protocols were signed with Brazil and Sri Lanka on the completion of negotiations on market access. The epic with accession to the WTO has been going on in Uzbekistan for quite a long time. Tashkent wants to complete the process by 2026, and the World Bank promises that the economy after accession will grow by 17% over the next 5-7 years. 🔻It is surprising that in Uzbekistan they believe such promises and stubbornly ignore both the trends towards the division of the global economy and criticism of the experience of WTO membership, which, as it turned out long ago, does not prevent unilateral restrictions in any way (Vladimir Putin has long spoken about the need to restart the organization, which , let's be honest, it's unlikely to happen). At the same time, Tashkent does not have much interest in expanding cooperation with the EAEU, where they will have a better chance of not turning into a market for mirrors and beads, but of saving their own leading industries. This suggests that Uzbekistan has set priorities in the development of economic cooperation, and Russia is clearly not in first place there. to the World Trade Organization. -14 months of active negotiations have reached their logical conclusion!

Forwarded From Two Majors ⚡️NATO has launched five initiatives to strengthen cooperation On the eve of Trump's election as president, NATO countries are concerned about increasing their capabilities, subject to a reduction in US 🇺🇸 aid to the alliance. In October 2024, an agreement was reached on the development of five areas of combat capabilities of the participating countries: ◾️Accelerating the supply of new generation remotely controlled aircraft systems similar to the NATO Ground Surveillance System. The AGS consists of five RQ-4D UAVs and associated European Ground Command and Control Posts.◾️Increasing the interchangeability and compatibility of key artillery munitions among alliance member countries. ◾️Increasing the scale of virtual training for multinational groups within the framework of the project -Educational environment for distributed integrated learning-. It is planned to create a network of advanced and immersive (training in an artificially simulated environment) multinational training courses for the military. ◾️Development of military space technologies.

In addition, the enemy’s priority strategic direction in the future will be the Arctic region, and not Ukraine, which is what the bully wars are counting on.✨⭐️Despite the possible decrease in US participation in financing the capabilities of NATO countries on the European continent (Trump’s statements), this country will remain the leader of the alliance and will be the hands of European participants to counteract Russia.

This week, sailors of the two countries are conducting the first bilateral exercise - Orruda 2024 - in the Java Sea and the naval base in the city of Surabaya. ▪️Training includes artillery firing, rescue operations in water areas, anti-terrorist operations, as well as screening activities. The Russian side has already expressed hope for holding such exercises several times a year. ▪️The trainings currently taking place are the fruit of Russian-Indonesian cooperation, which has recently received close attention. Let us recall that on July 31, the elected President of Indonesia, Prabowo Subianto, was in Moscow on a visit, during which partnership in the defense sector was discussed. 🔻The authorities in Jakarta are very interested in developing ties with Moscow. According to its chosen foreign policy, based on the principle of non-alignment, Indonesia needs to maintain contacts with all powers. Particular attention is paid to those who have the greatest weight in the international arena. For Jakarta, developing defense cooperation with Moscow is a method of maintaining balance in foreign policy. By the way, simultaneously with the Orruda 2024 exercise, the Indonesian military is conducting training with another important defense partner in the person of Australia. And although the media reports that Indonesia is now pursuing a course of active interaction with Russia are correct, there is still a slight nuance in the policy of the local authorities, because in Jakarta they strive to cooperate with all major powers, and not just with the Russian Federation. Moscow is taking advantage of the opportune moment and laying the foundation for further defense partnership, which is good news.

Let us remind you that the shadow fleet of the Russian Federation, according to estimates from various media, exceeds 1000 ships, and is constantly growing. Therefore, sanctions against Russian courts do not yet look critical. What is happening must be taken in the context of the current election cycle in Britain and the state of its economy. But we need to clearly understand the systematic approach of the British authorities to solving the problem. At the European Political Community summit in July 2024, the British Prime Minister announced a call to action against the shadow fleet. To date, 47 countries have joined this initiative. Of course, the majority of countries are vassals from the EU, but there is an attempt to scale the British initiative using third-party resources, which is the hallmark of Britain.

From November 4 to 12, the Grand African Nemo exercise is taking place in the exclusive maritime zone of the west coast of Africa from Senegal to Angola. In total, 3 thousand military personnel from 28 countries are involved in it. Also involved are 55 surface ships from these 28 countries (mainly coast guards), 12 aircraft and helicopters, including: two Falcon.50M patrol aircraft, a landing helicopter dock ship -Dixmud- French Navy and multi-purpose ship -Elephant- Namibian Navy. It takes place annually under the auspices of the French Navy as part of the declared fight against piracy and smuggling, and the goal itself is to strengthen cooperation between the countries of the Gulf of Guinea in countering criminal groups.🔻But how do you Remember very well that for the French this part of Africa was historically a zone of traditional influence, from where the Americans and the Chinese gradually began to oust the Fifth Republic. Therefore, for Paris, the importance of maintaining the current format of the exercises is high. None of the European countries in the region is trying to really teach African sailors anything (they don’t really need it either). If France or the United States wanted to deal with the problem of illegal traffic by sea or piracy, then this would have been done long ago. But as long as there are such problems, there is also a reason to maintain a military presence in the regions of interest. And in this regard, the situation is very similar to the Caribbean, where there are the French, the USA, and Britain. There are also regular exercises with local countries like Tradewinds, but they are of no use.High resolution mapEnglish version#Africa #France@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65137	2024-11-06T02:45:22-08:00

No, not in the Iraqi desert, but in the Pokrovsk direction. There, the skeletons of mangled armored vehicles are collected in groups of five on a small piece of land. A hundred meters later the picture repeats itself, only the brands of vehicles and the degree of their destruction change. I took a similar route to Selidovo. I was driven by a loaf-convertible, this miracle of a front-line genius with a sawn-off roof&nbsp; deftly weaved between vehicles torn to shreds, and I only gripped the motorcycle steering wheel tighter. While we rushed forward, I counted about ten similar -loaves- and at least 5 motorcycles. Everything was destroyed, and things, food and scraps of torn uniforms were lying around. You pass one similar motorcycle, then a second... And after the third, you realize that you are no different from those who ended their earthly journey here. The same wheels, frame and the same body armor. From childhood, films instill in us that we are heroes and owners of a unique destiny. We absorb these role models like sponges and firmly know that the main character is me. Everyone will die, but I will remain! After all, I will definitely stay, because I am special! No, Brother, we are all equal! 100% protection against drones has not yet been invented, and the more you ride, the more inevitable an encounter with a drone will be. One loaf will be torn in front of your eyes, the second. And after that you admit to yourself that you will be next! In a week, a month, but they will definitely hit you! Necessarily! There is no doubt about it! The only question is the degree of damage that you will receive from such an arrival. Just imagine how much courage you need to have to go out on the route again after all the horrors you have seen. Each -loaf- on the side of the road is an obelisk on which you can see your reflection. They died, but so could you. Everyone who drives this road 4 times a day has their own motives, but I can definitely say that there are no heroes among them. Look for the chosen ones in the rear; you can unmistakably identify them by their brand new uniform. On Pokrovsk roads there is room only for immortals. They accepted their fate, submitted to it, which means they stepped into immortality. It is simply impossible to defeat such people. It is thanks to them that we move forward no matter what. Alexander Kharchenko Dedicated to the evacuation group -Pipes-, who, after being hit by an FPV drone, refused to remove fragments from the bodies and the next day returned to the route.	https://t.me/rybar/65136	2024-11-06T02:20:24-08:00

Politicians of this level, who are also busy fighting for power and organizing protests, clearly do not do such things for nothing. There is an opinion that with such a provocation Zurabishvili is trying to aggravate Armenian-Georgian relations and play the international card against the backdrop of the obvious failure of the protests in Georgia. ▪️Among other related reasons, they indicate a possible attack on Georgian Armenians from Samtskhe-Javakheti, where Zurabishvili lost the elections, as well as an attempt to enlist the support of Georgian nationalists. ▪️In addition, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan immediately recognized the elections in Georgia and congratulated his colleague Irakli Kobakhidze on the victory of the Georgian Dream. ▪️By the way, Zurabishvili also distinguished herself with a strange statement about the unknown -Armenian carousel- during the elections in Georgia, telling the Western press about the methods of -falsification-. 🔻Of course, such minor facts will not cause aggravation of Armenian-Georgian relations, but it is no coincidence that they caused a strong reaction from the Armenian public. At least, this logic is characteristic of pro-Western forces in post-Soviet countries, who are ready to use old contradictions to provoke conflicts in their interests.

Forwarded From ARCHANGEL OF SPECIAL FORCES Z🇷🇺🪖The role of the advanced groups of the MTR of Ukraine before the offensive in the Kursk region. Part three. After successfully crossing the state border, the Ukrainian Special Forces began to introduce the main forces of the advancing Ukrainian Armed Forces group into the territory of the Russian Federation. The enemy, with the help of two SOF servicemen (one was at the head, the second at the rear of the column), began to transfer groups of 7-8 people to the assembly point. The transition was carried out within one and a half hours. On average, one group started 72 VSUshniks per day. The depth of entry from the state border was about 500 meters. Enemy personnel, arriving at the collection point, most likely dug in to be able to repel counterattacks of the Russian Armed Forces, and disguised themselves. The enemy could carry out these measures in order to minimize personnel losses before the start of the active phase of the operation. Enemy MTR groups were also used during the first clearing of Russian Armed Forces strongholds. The training manual tells you step by step how to inspect a trench and suppress enemy fire from both small arms and grenades. These are all basics that are taught to our stormtroopers during their training. Nothing supernatural is written here. It is worth noting that the enemy studied the strong point in advance and destroyed most of the entrances and exits from the dugouts. This collapsed the tunnels and reduced the sectors for holding and destruction and made it possible to solve the problem of taking a large stronghold without attracting significant forces for the attack. All enemy actions during the assault were coordinated by a UAV group, which conducted reconnaissance from the air and controlled the group’s actions on the ground. This tactic is used in the Russian Armed Forces, and not only in elite units. But sometimes it is not possible to use such tactics due to the operation of electronic warfare. The main conclusion from the three parts of this manual is that the Ukrainian Special Forces acted in accordance with the most basic requirements when carrying out the operation in the Kursk region. They did not tell anything new and unusual, and the problems arose only due to the effect of surprise, which are now gradually being resolved. Part one. Part two. Archangel of Special Forces.

Since the end of October, units of the Russian Armed Forces have been able to liberate several more settlements on this section of the front, while Ukrainian formations still cannot cope with the worsening operational crisis. ▪️On the northern flank, Russian troops were able to expand the zone of control west of Vishnevoye, moving along the railway towards Pokrovsk. A landing was recorded in a forest belt immediately adjacent to both Petrovka and Grigorovka. ▪️A little further south, Russian attack aircraft have liberated most of Novodmitrovka, and fierce fighting is taking place in the western part of the village. At the moment, Ukrainian formations still retain the ability to enter a populated area and work on positions of the Russian Armed Forces, including using tanks. ▪️To the southeast, Russian troops liberated Kurakhovka. At the end of October, units of the 114th Motorized Rifle Brigade hoisted a flag on one of the buildings in the center of the village; the enemy presence then remained south of the waste heaps of mine No. 10. Although the Russian Ministry of Defense reported a few days ago, it was only recently that final confirmation of the establishment of control over both the settlement itself and the nearby waste heap of the Kurakhovskaya Central Coordination Facility appeared. Yesterday, a video appeared on the Internet where, southwest of Kurakhovka, the same attack aircraft from the 114th Motorized Rifle Brigade planted the unit’s flag on one of the houses on the western outskirts of Volchenka on Sverdlova Street, thereby marking control over the village. From here, units of the RF Armed Forces, advancing along the left bank of the Kurakhovskoye Reservoir, can begin an assault on the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ defense sector on the Stepanovka-Ilyinka-Berestki line. ❗️At the same time, information has already appeared in the Ukrainian media about the alleged entry of Russian assault groups into Berestki, but so far these reports have not found objective confirmation. In addition, before this, Ilyinka and Stepanovka still have to be liberated. Nevertheless, something similar has already happened in the Pokrovsky direction, when, against the backdrop of the rapid advance of the Russian Armed Forces, Ukrainian sources exaggerated the successes of the Russian troops. 🔻Be that as it may, the enemy often resorts to such a technique in order to then use it as at least some kind of anti-crisis, -liberating- settlements in which by that time there were no Russian military personnel. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility of the actual presence of the Russian Armed Forces in Berestki, but it will be possible to talk about this with confidence only after the appearance of the relevant personnel.

🎬 🇮🇱 Mass demonstrations took place in Israel last night. This...	🇮🇱 Mass demonstrations took place in Israel last night. This time, the reason was the decision of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to dismiss the head of the defense department, Yoav Galant. Demonstrations took place in Jerusalem, Haifa and other cities. According to Israeli opposition media, the number of protesters amounted to several thousand people in Tel Aviv alone. There were some clashes with law enforcement agencies.▪️It is worth noting that citizens were provoked to take to the streets not only by the fact of what happened, but also by publications on the Internet that, following Yoav Galant, the Chief of the General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces Garzi Halevi and the head of the General Security Service would be fired Shabak Ronen Bar. This is especially true in light of recent Israeli polls: according to Channel 12, public trust in the current prime minister remains low. For comparison, the ratings of Halevi and Galant are taken, whose support is higher in comparison with Netanyahu.▪️In addition, opposition activists claim that this step was agreed upon with ultra-Orthodox officials in light of the fact that Galant supported the conscription of religious Jews into the army. However, the Prime Minister’s Office promptly denied such information. It is noteworthy that this is not the first dismissal of Galant: Benjamin Netanyahu once announced his resignation in the spring of 2023 due to the minister’s criticism of judicial reform, which also led to protests. And although he remained in his post, the contradictions between the two members of the Likud party only grew. Now one of these stumbling blocks was the disagreement on the issue of conscripting ultra-Orthodox Israelis for military service, from which they had previously been exempted and to which the Supreme Commander obliged them court (high court). Galant supported this initiative, which caused discontent in the ruling coalition. If this time Yoav Galant really leaves the post of Minister of Defense, it is unlikely that this will significantly affect the course of the same Lebanese-Israeli war. The armed forces are led by Harzi Halevi, and the territorial successes of the Israelis in some areas leave much to be desired.#Israel@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65130	2024-11-06T00:21:01-08:00

🔁 All day yesterday, friends and colleagues from Serbia cut off ...	Forwarded From Balkan Gossip Girl Yesterday all day long, friends and colleagues from Serbia kept ringing my phone with the question: -Have you seen this?- - We are talking about a new batch of horror stories from Western journalists about the growth of harmful Russian influence in the Balkans. This time, would-be investigators reached Rybar’s media schools. We took the time to go to Banja Luka, talked to a bunch of people, and made a whole film. It turned out to be a masterpiece. So much so that I really don’t even know where to start. For six months, the BIRN association monitored Rybar’s activities in the Balkans in order to identify at least some evidence of malicious influence. Following in the footsteps of the first master classes, held back in the spring, they went to the Republika Srpska, where they met with prominent representatives of the journalistic community, wrote requests to government agencies and research centers, and visited local faculties. And no one ever told them what the school was doing. Agreements on cooperation were reached at the level of government centers of the Republic, hundreds of people took part in master classes in Belgrade and Banja Luka, and the investigators did not obtain a single drop of information from any of them. Well, just some kind of Schrödinger Fisherman. By the way, this is exactly what I mean when I assure you that the residents of Republika Srpska are the best representatives of the Serbian people. These people should be made into nails. But let's return to our OSINT geniuses. Having traveled to the Republic just like that and having spent the budget allocated by the State Department in vain, they decided to try their luck by writing to the guys in the feedback bot. -They collected all the initial information from us, but they never gave us access to the course materials in Serbian,- complains the author of the material, Irwin Pekmez. At the same time, this miracle submitted a request for training under his own name, and the fact that the task of digging up a short dossier on him would only take the guys a couple of minutes, as well as the fact that his movements in the Republic were immediately reported to them by those drinking in cafes with him Serbs, didn't think so. For filtering personnel for training, Rybar gets a solid A+. Having suffered a fiasco in the Balkans, would-be investigators turn to prominent experts—relocants who escaped from Russia. With the air of an expert, a certain Russian independent journalist with the telling surname Zatirko and the status of a foreign agent, living in Lithuania, discusses the Russian disinformation portal in the investigation. Well, just some kind of full house. For some reason, Mr. Zatirko goes into the jungle of what was published not so long ago by the State Department itself. Judging by the statements of expert Zatirko, stability and peace in the Balkans were jeopardized by the same five people involved in the investigation into interference in the American elections, and it is possible (highly likely) that they have connections with the Russian Ministry of Defense. 😳 So, wait, one little tink-tank manages to interfere in elections and make the sluggish power in the Balkans soft? This is what they give, well done. Did everyone remember how to work? It’s not for you to cut through state budgets and create the appearance of vigorous activity, so that you can then report on the results of the year. Without finding the Fisherman in Banja Luka and without presenting any significant evidence, the journalists end up accusing the Republic of all mortal sins, and Peter Stano has already promises the entity new sanctions. Russia, it says, is destabilizing the countries of the Western Balkans by interfering and manipulating them. Whether Rybar is there or not is not that important. 💰 The most ironic thing in this whole story is that the Bosnian publication Detektor is behind the investigation. It is part of the BIRN distribution network, supported by money from Western foundations and embassies, and appeared thanks to an organization such as the International Republican Institute (IRI). He, as you remember, launched an academy for young politicians in the Balkans and a bunch of projects to format the Serbian media environment.

Russian troops hit the workshops of the Motor Sich enterprise in occupied Zaporozhye, and also once again attacked targets with drones in Kyiv and other regions of the so-called. Ukraine. In the Kursk direction, Russian troops expanded the zone of control in the Glushkovsky district and hit several armored vehicles from the UAV - Inokhodets - in Sudzhansky. In the Kupyansky direction, Russian units attacked in the direction of Zagryzovo and expanded the zone of control south of Berestovoye. In the Limansky direction, military operations continue in Terny, where fighters of the Russian Armed Forces are fighting their way deeper into the development of the village.

The footage captured the moment of installing a minefield in the gaps - the teeth of the dragon - on the border with the so-called. Ukraine. The infantry group approached the demarcation line on foot from the forest, without resorting to the use of armored vehicles. It is likely that in the forest belts closest to the village to the east and west there is no accumulation of enemy forces.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, the 13th effective use of UAV guided weapons against enemy armored vehicles was noted. In Nikolskoye and its environs, one tank and an infantry fighting vehicle of the Ukrainian Armed Forces were destroyed. In Daryino, the armored fighting vehicle -Kazak-7- was destroyed by a fiber-optic controlled drone -Prince Vandal of Novgorod-. In addition, cases of looting of residential buildings by the Ukrainian Armed Forces were noted in the village, which once again refutes earlier textual requests for the liberation of the village by the Russian Armed Forces. In the Korenevsky district, positional clashes continue as usual near Novoivanovka and Nizhny Klin; there has been no information about the advance of Russian troops .▪️In the Sumy region, missile attacks and arrivals of guided air missiles were noted on enemy targets in Sumy, which is a hub for Ukrainian armored vehicles and manpower advancing on the Kursk region.

This was confirmed, among other things, by objective control footage demonstrating an attack by Russian military personnel on the eastern outskirts of the latter. At the same time, fighting continues in Antonovka, located on the opposite bank of the Sukhie Yaly River - there, attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces occupied several enemy positions on Stepovaya and Gagarin streets, capturing several members of the Ukrainian formations. According to the latest information, about a third of the village is under the control of Russian troops. ▪️As for the section to the southwest, there was confirmation of a clearing -pocket- on the Bogoyavlenka - Novoukrainka line. At the moment, Russian units are not only moving relatively calmly along the S051133 highway, but also occupying positions in the Konstantinopolskaya Dacha tract located to the north. From the latter, assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces have already launched several attacks towards another key route in this direction - O0510. In particular, this is evidenced by footage published by colleagues from the Voin DV channel, according to which Russian military personnel landed in a forested area less than 2 km south of the indicated route and 3.5 km from the village of Konstantinopolskoye. ❗️At the same time, a further offensive towards the Sukhie Yaly River with its subsequent forcing will lead to the encirclement of Kurakhovo, where fierce fighting in the east of the city is currently not abating. On the other hand, this will endanger a significant group of the Ukrainian Armed Forces holding positions in populated areas on the right bank of the Sukhie Yaly River: from the village of the same name to the Elizavetovka-Ilyinka line. 🔻Lately, the description of what is happening in the special operation zone in many thematic patriotic chats has largely come down to the well-known interjection. But it is important to understand that such successes were achieved by the heroism and blood of Russian military personnel, the pace of whose progress never ceases to amaze. As for the Ukrainian media and military observers, the situation there is radically opposite - while some daily complain about bad news from the fronts and the worsening operational crisis, others, to put it mildly, are perplexed about the appropriateness of the adventures previously undertaken by the Kyiv authorities, including in the Kursk region. 📌Nevertheless, for now you and I are observing the offensive map being methodically played out on the fronts of the Donetsk People’s Republic from several sides at once, the logical result of which will be the liberation of a significant amount of territory with the central settlement represented by Kurakhovo. And one of the striking consequences of the current successes has already been a significant decrease in the intensity of shelling of Donetsk: according to JCCC data, not a single ammunition has been fired at it over the past two days. Previously, shelling on the city was carried out, including from the direction of Kurakhovo, but the attack on it from the south and north forced the Ukrainian Armed Forces to move the self-propelled gun firing positions to a safer distance from the front line.

This is the second stage of this teachings. The first one, if you forgot, took place in February of this year. As then, the leadership of the event was entrusted to the 56th Artillery Command of the US Army, which was recreated after the start of the North Military District. Previously, these exercises were also held every year, but with the progress of the North Military District, the concept changed. Taking into account the experience of using artillery in the Northern Military District, the number of training areas was increased from one to five, and the number increased from 2.4 thousand to 5.5 thousand military personnel. The Alliance took into account new trends that emerged during the conflict and adapted tactics to the conduct of war on a front of wide extent, where the main factor for success is the presence of clear coordination and communication between units. Actually, this is what they do. Only this time the areas of the exercise are very, very provocative - Romania, Poland, Finland and Estonia. Everything is very close to the Russian borders, which is especially important given the frequent statements of the Baltic countries and Poland about their readiness to launch a preventive strike on Russia.

Not all of their activities are obvious and noticeable. But their importance cannot be underestimated.▪️Unmanned dominance - it was the crews of special reconnaissance units that were the first to use combat and attack drones even before it became mainstream. Catapults, copters, fiber optic UAVs, fixed wings, the latest training simulators - all this appears first in reconnaissance, and then reaches infantry units.▪️Technical reconnaissance - one of the most important areas of activity is the extraction of technical documentation and samples of military and special enemy technology. Everything is used - right down to banal bribery and payment for the work of -trophy teams- (and not only in the Northern Military District zone).▪️Cyber ​​operations - the fame of Russian hackers resounds all over the world, and their effectiveness is widely known. There are hackers and specialists in cyber operations in every law enforcement agency, and the Main Directorate of the General Staff is no exception. ▪️Undercover intelligence - with the beginning of not even the Northern Military District, but the Syrian campaign, it became obvious that undercover work, its forms and types must evolve and meet current challenges. Russian intelligence officers recruit dozens of people, ensuring the receipt of valuable intelligence information and carrying out special events.▪️Work -in the field- - it has long been no secret to anyone that experienced intelligence officers coordinate the activities of individual formations in conflict zones and act as instructors and commanders, ensuring the war by proxy.▪️Electronic reconnaissance - RER units and objects are a priority target for the enemy group: RER members intercept and decipher conversations, obtain documents, track satellites and timely detect the exits of enemy aircraft, UAVs and BECs.#art #Russia@ rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65100	2024-11-05T07:02:01-08:00

We weren't kidding, the exercises in Finland are going on one after another, and yesterday two new exercises started at once.▪️Let's start with the less important one. The scheduled training -Tuppi 2024- has started in central Finland, and new pilots on Hawk training aircraft are taking part in it. They learn to fly at low altitudes and conduct air combat.▪️But more important is another event, code-named Lightning Strike, and other NATO countries are already participating in it, including units of the Armed Forces of Great Britain, the United States, France, the Czech Republic, Sweden and Estonia. In total - about 3.6 thousand military personnel and 300 units of military equipment. It is one of the most important exercises of the Alliance in the autumn preparation period, during which NATO units at the Rovajärvi training ground play out the scenario of a full-scale conflict with Russia, including defense and offensive. The role of Finland in confrontation with Russia is extremely high in the plans of the North Atlantic Alliance due to its geographical location on the northern borders of Russia and as part of the growing confrontation in the Arctic region, so such exercises will be expected more and more often every year.

In the form of Russian launch vehicles, Iranian partners have received a very good means of delivering payloads into orbit, which they are experiencing difficulties with. Iran's space industry still has serious difficulties, especially with launch vehicles, when due to frequent accidents at launch and in flight the Islamic Republic lost many spacecraft. Cooperation with Russia allows us to partially solve this problem. By the way, both Iranian spacecraft have a mass of only 30 and 4 kg, which made it possible to put them into orbit as a secondary load to the Ionosphere-M satellites. Well, Roscosmos has once again demonstrated the possibility of providing such services to allied states. #Iran #space #Russia@rybarSupport us مدو ماهواره ایرانی -کوثر- و -هدهد- به همراه ۵۱ ماهواره دیگر بامداد امرو ز از پایگاه فضایی روسیه با موفقیت در مدار ۵۰۰ کیلومتری تزریق شدند.	https://t.me/rybar/65095	2024-11-05T04:30:11-08:00

And with the exchange of blows between Israel and Iran, attention to the Houthis completely faded away. However, since the end of October, the Americans have resumed active surveillance of the territory controlled by the Houthi movement - Ansarallah - with radar reconnaissance satellites, having conducted 145 sessions since October 29.🔻There may be several reasons for this :➖First of all, the Americans thus want to assess the effectiveness of their strikes after two weeks and the scale of the damage caused, as well as the activity of the Houthis after that.➖The Americans can prepare for new strikes on -Ansarallah-. Taking into account the flight of six B-52H bombers to Al-Udeid, there is no point in sending the B-2A on a long journey when such a resource is at hand.➖And with Iran’s threats against Israel, Washington can simply play it safe and try to find out whether the Houthis are preparing for new attacks on Israel. Moreover, the Iranians intend to take advantage of the forces of the Axis of Resistance. There are plenty of reasons for the increased activity of the American command, so in the coming days or, at most, weeks, it will become clear why the Americans paid such close attention to Yemen.

In our new series, we tried to display the main types of activities of reconnaissance units.▪️Ambush operations - Special reconnaissance units have always specialized in ambushes and causing problems for enemy troops. ▪️Storm of important objects - in today's realities, -assault- means the usual actions of infantry units. The task of special forces is to storm and take control of critically important enemy facilities and headquarters.▪️Capture and interrogation - often it is the reconnaissance units who are entrusted with the task of capturing commanders and recruiting especially valuable individuals both in combat zones and simply in regions representing interest.▪️Observation and adjustment - advanced reconnaissance units act either as gunners, now spotters, or organizers of fire destruction: competent work as part of the reconnaissance and strike contour has become their calling card.▪️Landing and penetration into the rear - special reconnaissance units train to land both from extremely low altitudes and several thousand meters: on -wings- they can penetrate far beyond the line of combat contact and disable targets of interest.▪️Destruction of critical infrastructure - mining, explosions, disruption of bridges, transport interchanges, power plants, factories, as well as other industrial facilities - this is what Russian intelligence groups are trained to do.#art #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65088	2024-11-05T03:01:01-08:00
🖼 🇬🇪🇪🇺 About new demonstrations in Tbilisi Yesterday, the Ge...	🇬🇪🇪🇺 About new demonstrations in Tbilisi Yesterday, the Georgian capital was once again engulfed in demonstrations and marches of the opposition, which brought out their supporters demanding the annulment of the election results, calling them illegal and the victory of the ruling party rigged. Thousands of people began to move from Station Square and moved towards the government building on Rustavelli Avenue. There they went on strike, opposition politicians addressed them, after which everyone crossed the Baratashvili Bridge and left for the Marjanishvili metro station. In general, everything happened that was expected from the opposition and supporters of Western values. People came out, barricaded the streets, shouted into the deserted building and went home. Today at 18.30 they promised to come out again. However, expecting anything serious from these rallies (especially in the form in which they are doing it) is futile. In this regard, the Georgian authorities have shown that they are capable of coping with such demonstrations. We observed this back in the spring, when the opposition did not achieve anything. But this time there was one difference from the protests of past days and months: yesterday’s rallies were attended by the well-known Greta Thunberg. We talked about how her image is used by Western media and corporations last year. In the past, it has established itself as an instrument of pressure on representatives of national governments, but previously this only affected the environmental issue. Its appearance on the streets of Tbilisi is a rather interesting, but at the same time dubious PR stunt, which is unlikely to lead to anything serious. Although the Swedish activist specializes in street protests and public speeches, which are good against -led- governments, in contrast to the rationally acting Georgian authorities. By the way, Azerbaijan can be calm with its COP29 summit in Baku. Thunberg refused to go to Azerbaijan as a sign of protest.

Forwarded From ARCHANGEL OF SPECIAL FORCES Z🇷🇺🪖The role of the advanced groups of the MTR of Ukraine before the offensive in the Kursk region. Part two. And some more interesting details that we read in the enemy manual on the use of combat experience of the Special Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk direction: - Preparation of routes for penetration into the territory of the Russian Federation. Previously, the enemy worked out all the scenarios for entry by the Special Forces of the Armed Forces with the development of scenarios: - what if? -. In the training manual, this is presented rather pompously, as if they were going to take the Pentagon. However, in fact, this is an integral part of the planning of any task. — The enemy used special forces units to cross the state border, as well as to make passages for the main forces. Five groups of Special Forces: - 2 groups of Special Forces GVP, - 1 group of Special Forces (Sniper), - 2 groups of Special Forces UAVs. From the composition of the groups, the following can be noted: the enemy created completely autonomous units to carry out the combat mission strictly with the forces of this group without attracting additional forces. This significantly reduces the risk of unjustified losses, since failure to complete one task does not affect others.— When preparing the MTR approach, the following activities were carried out: - surveying of the terrain and various objects, including military ones: minefields and obstacles, etc.; the areas of responsibility of each unit were outlined; - the key areas of reconnaissance were determined. And again, Ukrainian -analysts- presented this as something incredible, but this also applies to the standard planning of ANY combat mission. Before introducing the main forces, the enemy was sent to make passages, where the reconnaissance miners took on the main work. When crossing the border, the enemy made passages in fences and fences the size of a man to minimize the factors of an unplanned stop, thereby ensuring the speed of overcoming this element of defense by other units. The problem that the enemy faced during additional reconnaissance and making passes was anti-tank ditches that could not be overcome alone. At the same time, overcoming the engineering barrier did not become a problem, judging by the experience described, but the passages in the minefields were mainly made by wild animals. – From the above point, it is worth noting the lack of constant control of the perimeter by our side. The advanced reconnaissance groups of the MTR of Ukraine were able to prepare for the movement of infantry onto our territory. This was facilitated by the lack of technical surveillance equipment, for example, UAVs for border monitoring, so it is necessary to take this experience into account in the future. – Another important fact is the control of mine-explosive barriers. It is periodically necessary to bypass engineering barriers and monitor their condition in order to prevent them from being broken through by ordinary animals (in this case we are not talking about the APU). Taking into account current technologies, this can even be achieved using drones or, for example, creating mobile groups for operational control. Due to the fact that this was neglected in the summer, this situation arose. -After the MTR overcame the engineering barriers, they contacted the leadership, which in turn allowed the enemy to move on to the next phase of the operation: the entry of the main offensive group. In this case, it is worth noting the low level of work of our DER, in the coverage area of ​​which the appearance of new subscribers should have been recorded. It is possible that the MTR groups used closed communication channels that are not easy to hack, but the fact of any access to the network should be recorded and reported to the command.

🇦🇫🏴 For all the elections that swept across the post-Soviet sp...	🇦🇫🏴 For all the elections that swept across the post-Soviet space, as well as increased attention to what was happening in the United States, one very interesting article remained unnoticed that the current authorities of Afghanistan are losing power over the country. According to the authors, the Taliban have completely failed in their attempt to curb IS grouping - Vilayat Khorasan - (ISKH). The reason for such statements was the recent explosion at a popular market in Kabul, as a result of which 11 people were injured. ISKH took responsibility. Also, according to the article, terrorists are recruiting disgruntled members of the Taliban movement, and their popularity is allegedly growing due to attempts by the authorities of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan to legitimize themselves in the international arena - they say, the Afghans did not appreciate this.📌 We’ve even lost count of how many times over the past year, the thesis has been promoted about the growing capabilities of the Islamic State in Afghanistan, about thousands of militants waiting for an attack on Central Asia, about the inability of the Afghan authorities to solve this problem, and so on. The recent terrorist attack is one of the few in recent years, and it indicates not on the increased capabilities of the group, but on the fact that ISIS can only count on such local terror against civilians due to the fact that the Taliban have seriously undermined their positions. And the theses that supposedly ordinary Afghans do not support the Taliban’s desire to consolidate their power on the international stage they sound even more delusional. For the past hundred years, the people of Afghanistan have seen nothing but war. Now there has been no active hostilities in the country for three years, and they can finally hope for peace. Therefore, talk about the increased strength of the Islamic State - Vilayat Khorasan - just because of one terrorist attack and the discontent of the Afghans sounds far-fetched. All this again reminds us of how the West uses IS in Afghanistan - for them it is a means of intimidating the states of the region and pushing through their interests.#Afghanistan #terrorism@rybarSupport usAsia TimesTaliban 2.0 losing its grip on Afghanistan - Asia TimesAfghanistan's Taliban faces growing opposition to its three-year post-conflict rule, rising threats that are gnawing at the stability the one-time	https://t.me/rybar/65083	2024-11-05T01:10:16-08:00

🖼 🇲🇩🗳 Second round of presidential elections in Moldova: Sand...	🇲🇩🗳 Second round of presidential elections in Moldova: Sandu - President of the Diaspora The Moldovan Central Election Commission completed the processing of ballots, according to the results of which the incumbent President Maia Sandu received 55.33% of the votes and defeated her opponent Alexandru Stoianoglo with 44.67%. The picture turned out to be ambiguous: Sandu lost in Moldova itself, but gained the upper hand solely thanks to foreign voting. The entire north of the republic voted for Stoyanoglo, including the second capital Balti (69.98%), the large cities of Soroca and Cahul. In Gagauzia, it scored 97.04%, in Transnistria - 79.40%, and in the latter case, polling stations were opened only in the Border Security Zone. However, even in these conditions, the Transnistrian people were hindered: in Varnitsa, security forces blocked all polling stations for several hours after calls about mining, after which there were reports about the seizure of the ballot box. The movement of voters from Transnistria to Moldova along the Rybnitsa-Rezina bridge was also slowed down - it was closed several times and road works were organized. As a result, not all Pridnestrovians were able to vote, being stuck in traffic jams. 🔻Inside Moldova, Sandu won in three large cities: Chisinau (57.38%), Orhei (52.24%), Ungheni (50.60%). As in the case of the referendum on European integration, the current president was saved by the voting results of the foreign diaspora, where it received 82.83%. However, not everything is so simple with him: for example, only two polling stations were opened in Russia, where no more than 10 thousand voters could vote. From the very morning, a line lined up outside the embassy in Moscow, but there weren’t enough ballots, after which the dissatisfied began to chant -Down with Maia Sandu.- But in Italy, 60 polling stations were opened, and there were literally no voters in one of them. At the same time, a commission employee in Turin asked the girl to sign for another person who allegedly forgot to do so. And in British Liverpool, the polling station was suddenly moved to Manchester.❗️The Socialist Party, which nominated Stonoyanoglo, announced non-recognition of the voting results abroad. They refused to recognize the elections as fair and transparent and noted that the majority of Moldovan residents voted against the current government in the person of Sandu. Such statements have every basis: manipulations with traffic stops, large-scale false mining, as well as the closure and transfer of polling stations were not observed even during the first round and the referendum on European integration. With such mixed results, Moldova is reaching a political impasse, and social divisions are becoming increasingly obvious. Considering Sandu’s hostile and uncompromising rhetoric towards all those who disagree, she certainly will not soften it and seek compromises with the majority of the population that voted against her.

In Ukraine, the process is an increase in the number of public statements about the need to mobilize women. If at the beginning of the year these were rare calls from individual little-known individuals, now representatives of the Kyiv regime are openly talking about this. At the same time, the practical implementation of this idea at the moment looks doubtful. It is possible that such messages act as an element of escalating the situation in order to create an information background for lowering the age of conscription of the male population to 18 years. If in Kyiv they really want to mobilize women, then this could be a serious blow both from a socio-economic point of view and media point of view. Footage of TCC employees en masse abducting from the streets not only elderly and former students, but also girls, will illustrate the final failure of the Ukraine project. #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramTASSMobilization of women in Ukraine is necessary.

In May, in two localities in Kyrgyzstan, radical Islamists burned the flags of the republic and replaced them with their own. Later, law enforcement agencies detained six representatives of Hizb ut-Tahrir. A couple of months later, another Hizb ut-Tahrir cell was liquidated in Shymkent, Kazakhstan, whose members recruited under the legend of auyzasharov (the ritual of breaking the fast). And in November, another 10 preachers of the group were detained in Kentau, and their leader had previously been prosecuted for participating in the activities of an extremist organization. Destabilization in the region did not pass by the authorities of Kazakhstan: the country’s Prime Minister Olzhas Bektenov proposed making changes to the legal framework of the CSTO and expand the number of grounds for sending military contingents from other states in the event of a participating country asking for help. Currently, these include the threat or commission of an armed attack, the liquidation of emergencies, and the conduct of exercises. The politician proposes to add to the list the provision of humanitarian aid, unannounced inspections and, most importantly, the prevention (resolution) of crisis situations. Under the wording lies a situation that poses a threat to security, stability, territorial integrity, sovereignty of a member state and/or destabilization of the region, requiring the adoption of collective response measures by the CSTO. As part of the initiative, the legal regulation of the transportation of military units and military products of the CSTO is already being improved. The activities of the CSTO in the region and the recent successful operation of the anti-drug forces - Channel-Vanguard - have already attracted the attention of a concerned international community. During the latest financial intelligence investigation of the CSTO countries, they joined forces, as a result of which they were able to stop the activities of several cartels, block smuggling channels, liquidate laboratories, and seize drugs and weapons. Such fruitful interaction could not fail to attract the attention of the United Nations, so valued by Kazakh President Kassym -Zhomart Tokayev: Recently, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime announced the need for accelerated implementation of the UN Convention against Corruption in the region.

So does critical thinking. Every LOM, blogger or journalist should always know the unspoken rules, since he is responsible for what he writes and says - first of all, to his audience;▪️conspiracy theories (including about comprehensive Russian intervention) have become the most convenient story for manipulating stupid and narrow-minded people.

Forwarded From Two Majors🇪🇺⚡️Europe will try to sponsor Ukraine until the end On November 4, the head of the 🇩🇪German Foreign Ministry, Berbock, came to Kyiv on an unannounced visit, declaring -strong support for Ukraine-. On the eve of this trip, the Institute of World Economics in Kiel (IfW) published a study on the feasibility of continuing to provide military-technical assistance to Ukraine. According to IfW data, Germany allocates an average of about 0.1% of GDP to support Ukraine. If it is defeated, these costs will increase 10-20 times due to the influx of additional refugees (estimated from 1.9 to 3.8 million people), which will increase the costs of maintaining the social sphere. The fall of Ukraine will also force increased spending on increasing the combat capability of the Baltic countries (it is believed that Russia will cut through the Suwal Corridor). In addition, cheap resources (metals, agricultural products) and investments will be lost. The IfW study only confirms our assessments about the need to destroy the economic feasibility of Western investments in Ukraine. Against this background, Deutschlandtrend publishes the results of a survey of Germans, according to which if elections to the Bundestag were held in last Sunday, all three ruling parties would have lost power. At the same time, 54% of respondents are in favor of holding early parliamentary elections in the country. ✨On October 16, the saboteur Chancellor Scholz came up with an initiative for a ceasefire and the start of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine.

During its testing, another UAV was successfully hit, traveling at an altitude of 200 meters at a speed of 80 km/h. Judging by the recording, the drone has an optical homing head and operates on the -fire and forget- principle, and the shot is fired from a portable installation. The destruction of the target is carried out due to kinetic impact through impact. The characteristics of the product are not given, but the technical design looks very interesting. The absence of a warhead with an explosive in the device also makes it possible to solve the issue of equipping civilians with them, such as guarding oil depots and other facilities. In general, one can observe how interceptor drones are increasingly becoming an element of air defense along with traditional anti-aircraft missile and gun systems.

Democrats, for example, are actively disseminating information in the press that Russia is allegedly helping Donald Trump, using the method of information operations and disinformation described in the above-mentioned report. ▪️Republicans, in turn, argue that Democrats rely on unscrupulous software (falls under the cyberthreats section) and even resort to physical threats against election officials. 🔻Actually, all these reports are an ordinary tribute to fashion, populism and a convenient support for opposing sides to accuse each other of election fraud. A lot of material has been written on this topic, but there is a nuance - neither Democrats nor Republicans have been able to provide clear evidence in court of the bad faith of one side or another. #USA@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport usTelegramIIB School🇺🇸 The most serious threats to the upcoming presidential elections.

🔁🖼 🪖About the analysis of the actions of the Ukrainian Special...	Forwarded From ARCHANGEL OF SPECIAL FORCES Z🇷🇺🪖On the analysis of the actions of the Ukrainian Special Forces during the Northern Military District. Part No. 1. An interesting training manual, intended for the MTR of Ukraine, fell into our hands. And the first thing we paid attention to was the issue of organizing an operational headquarters to manage the operation. The enemy describes every step related to the organization and technical content of the headquarters, as well as methods of interaction between the headquarters and Special Forces groups. The enemy appeals to the following concepts: - Tactical Operations Center (TOC) - Logistics Center (LC) - Command post of the tactical group KP TGr. The enemy proposes the use of TOC and KP TGr in two options, based on the experience in the Kursk region, where the first provides for the placement of controls in different locations, and the second - a mixed option. In the first case, the advantage is camouflage and dispersal, that is, in the event of the destruction of one of controls or destruction of communications equipment in it, control will continue from other command posts. The second option provides faster decision-making speed and adjustment of TG actions. Indeed, with the first option it is possible to secure the control system, because Finding and destroying field headquarters is not the easiest task. Despite the fact that such headquarters are located in close proximity to the site of hostilities, they are well protected by both technical means and camouflage. The management structure at headquarters looks interesting, where tasks are dispersed between different departments: -S2 (Intelligence). -S3 (Planning). -S4 (Logistics). -S6 (Communication). - Operations officer. - Liaison officer. All this indicates that the enemy accumulates organs with different tasks in one place, which allows operations to be carried out with minimal involvement of third-party units, but at the same time in a comprehensive manner, essentially creating an autonomous control body over a separate TG. The manual also describes that before the headquarters and personnel of the TGr leave for the destination, a support group must leave with the tasks of finding and organizing possible housing for groups of joint ventures, locating a technical center, a logistics center and organizing everyday life. When equipping the TGR command post, the need to provide equipment is taken into account: - Starlink- ATAK - used for interaction and coordination with special forces groups. - DELTA - used for interaction with higher headquarters and a general understanding of the situation in the mission area (Duplicate AlpineQuest program). - Nettle - used to mark neighboring units, for data exchange and overlaying the operational situation on the map, studying the characteristics of the terrain, as well as general analysis. - Signal messenger All communication sessions of the group take place in real time, and all the information that was obtained - with the eyes and hands - is marked on maps with photos and videos. But there is a nuance that if the equipment falls into the hands of military personnel of the RF Armed Forces, then all secrecy and camouflage collapses. Judging by the supply list, organizing the work of the headquarters is not the easiest task, since there are certain requirements for placing a command post: - tactical crew - the location must be in close proximity to the operation area for operational control of units. - logistics support - convenient communication routes, the presence of entrances to the headquarters, places for hidden parking of vehicles and an acceptable distance to other structural elements. - security measures - the possibility of camouflage, which hides the presence of a military facility, as well as the lack of free access to the premises for unauthorized persons. That is, a place that would be unremarkable for reconnaissance, and would also have shelter from fire weapons.❗️From the point of view of tactics, the actions of the Ukrainian MTR are quite understandable. The requirements that are imposed on forward control points must be observed in any unit, not to mention the most trained. Archangel of Special Forces.

🇺🇸 There is only a day left before the US presidential election...	🇺🇸 There is only a day left before the presidential elections in the United States, and the opposing sides are not abandoning attempts to bring down each other’s ratings by publishing compromising publications in the press. This time, the blow was dealt to Donald Trump: The Daily Beast, together with the controversial writer Michael Wolff, published voice messages of the now deceased American financier and pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, in which he admits that he was Trump's closest friend for 20 years. In audio recordings from 2017 he says that Trump invited his fellow entrepreneurs to his office in New York and invited them to sleep with female models. Then he allegedly recorded the conversations and gave them to the businessmen’s wives to -establish relationships with them.- According to Epstein, Trump also regularly seduced the women of his best friends. Michael Wolff claims that he had many photographs of Trump from Epstein's parties with naked girls. However, the writer cannot demonstrate or publish the photographs - the photos were allegedly seized by the FBI. The Trump campaign has already issued a refutation of Epstein’s words, but the testimony of the scandalous financier already looks dubious. Suspicions are raised by the fact that they were made in 2017 - just in the first year of Trump's presidency, when he was under unprecedented pressure from the Democrats who had lost the elections. But there is simply no really strong evidence in the form of photographs. Apparently, it was precisely because of their dubiousness that the audio recordings published by The Daily Beast did not take off: the story was picked up by only a few American newspapers, and it did not spread at all on social networks. Now we can no longer expect anything more powerful from the Democrats - there are two days left before the election, and all the trump cards that Harris had at her disposal have most likely already been used. #USA@rybar with @usaperiodicalSupport usThe Daily BeastListen To The Jeffrey Epstein Tapes: 'I Was Donald Trump's Closest Friend'Explosive tapes recorded by author Michael Wolff show Epstein claiming Trump liked to -f---- his friends' wives and first slept with Melania on the -Lolita Express.-	https://t.me/rybar/65055	2024-11-04T02:10:24-08:00

🎬 🇮🇱🇸🇾 The press service of the Israel Defense Forces announ...	🇮🇱🇸🇾 The press service of the Israel Defense Forces announced a special operation in Syria. The Israelis went deep into the country and detained a Syrian who worked for the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Soldiers from Unit 504 of the Israeli Military Intelligence Directorate and special forces from Egoz took part in the raid. The target turned out to be a certain Ali Suleiman al-Assi: he was collecting intelligence on the movements of Israeli troops in the occupied Syrian Golan Heights. During interrogation, Al-Assi admitted that he was contacted by an Iranian intelligence agent who ordered him to simply monitor the borders and pass on information about Israeli patrols. At the same time, the detainee acted under the guise of a Syrian military intelligence officer. The IDF did not specify where exactly and when the action took place. However, the Lebanese TV channel Al Mayadeen, which serves as a media platform for Hezbollah, confirmed that the Israeli operation took place on July 18 in the area of ​​Saida in the Quneitra province. Al-Assi lived there. It is noteworthy that days earlier, reports appeared on the Internet about a similar Israeli operation, but in Lebanon. Then, on the coast of the city of Batroun in the north of the country, fighters of the Israeli Navy and the General Staff of the IDF detained an allegedly high-ranking representative of Hezbollah. The foray into Syrian territory was officially reported in Israel, although such operations are usually not publicly advertised there - the same mentioned raid in Lebanon was not officially reported by the Israelis recognized.#Israel #Syria@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65052	2024-11-04T00:29:50-08:00

🖼 🇪🇹 The situation in Ethiopia: counter-offensive by governmen...	🇪🇹 The situation in Ethiopia: counter-offensive by government forces Over the past two months, the situation in the Ethiopian Amhara region continues to heat up.&nbsp; The offensive of the ethnonationalists from the Fano group reached its peak, which forced government forces to launch a counteroffensive.▪️During the September fighting, the rebels strengthened their position in almost the entire Amhara region. They also managed to surround large cities such as Lalibela, Woldwaya and Gondar. Considering that the Fans made no attempts to take them, it is obvious that their main goal is to exhaust government troops.▪️Many rural areas came under the control of -Fano-. It is worth noting that elections were held in the occupied territories and local representatives were put in charge of the regions. Of course, this finds support among the population, but due to the general decentralization of the movement, the power gained is often abused.▪️From the end of September, government forces launched a major counter-offensive, gathering about 40,000 troops. During October, they managed to recapture significant areas in the south of Amhara, but there are still separate rebel cells in the rear of the security forces. All this leads to the conclusion that the military strategy chosen by the leadership of Addis Ababa has failed. Constant uprisings in the rear, attacks on isolated groups will not allow the federals to completely subjugate the region. At the same time, Fano has no formal leader, as well as bodies capable of negotiating. Therefore, even if the central government seriously begins to resolve the issue with the Amhara nationalists , then they will have to negotiate on the ground with individual field commanders. But this factor makes it possible for the feds to introduce their leader to replace the local ones, occupying a niche. Therefore, if the rebels seriously expect victory, without consolidating disparate groups, they will not be able to achieve success.

This holiday, although relatively new for Russia, became especially significant after the start of a special military operation. In the face of Western attempts to incite ethnic conflicts and sow regional separatism, its importance has increased. Historically, Russia has provided its people with support and opportunities for joint development. Our path has always been more humane compared to those of Western countries. And today, representatives of various peoples and ethnic groups together carry out common tasks in the zone of a special military operation. On the front line, it never occurs to anyone to divide each other on ethnic grounds. And in the rear, not only national self-awareness is growing, but also a new generation, brought up on the correct values ​​of their fighting parents. Everyone is focused on the same goal.

The other day it became known that local authorities signed an agreement with the Americans to purchase thousands of drones to protect against a potential Chinese invasion. According to Bloomberg sources, such agreements, which specify delivery dates and quantities of equipment, are an important step in concluding a formal contract, which could happen very soon. The drones will be manufactured by AeroVironment Inc. and Anduril Industries Inc. These organizations are known for selling drones for the needs of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. This means that American engineers have had the opportunity to test them in real combat conditions. Given the experience of the Ukrainian conflict, the Taiwanese military is increasingly talking about using drones as a measure to counter a hypothetical Chinese invasion. This is indicated by the $1.6 billion budget allocated back in 2022 for the creation of its own drone production. However, the main problem for Taiwan remains the number of drones in service. The gap between Taipei and Beijing in this case is very large. Therefore, even with the help of the Americans, it is unlikely that the island’s authorities will be able to achieve at least some parity with mainland China in the near future. #USA #Taiwan @rybar with @awaken_dragonSupport usBloomberg.comTaiwan Moves to Buy 1,000 AeroVironment, Anduril Attack DronesThe Taiwan Ministry of Defense has signed formal agreements with the US government allowing it to buy as many as 1,000 attack drones from AeroVironment Inc. and Anduril Industries Inc. to aid in blunting a potential Chinese assault on the island democracy…	https://t.me/rybar/65036	2024-11-03T08:31:24-08:00

Yesterday it became Kemi Badenoch, who beat her opponent Robert Jenrick by 12,418 votes (53,806 to 41,388). 📌Before her career in politics, Badenok managed to work in the field of information technology and finance, joined the party in 2005, and in 2017 became a member of parliament. In previous governments, she served as Secretary of State for Business and Trade, Minister for Women and Equalities, and Minister for Foreign Trade.▪️The new leader is from the right wing of the Conservative Party and advocates free markets, as well as a reduced role of the state in the economy. She is known for her outspokenness and willingness to openly discuss controversial issues. Kemi Badenoch inherited a fragmented party that suffered a crushing defeat in parliamentary elections and retained only 121 of 650 seats (before the vote the Tories controlled 365 seats). In her victory speech, Badenoch promised to -renew- the party and told supporters it was -time to get down to business.- Of course, it has not gone unnoticed that Kemi Badenoch is the first black leader of a British parliamentary party. Current Prime Minister Keir Starmer also drew attention to this fact. Considering recent trends, this situation does not look so surprising.

The attack was the largest attack by radical Islamists in recent years. In response, the Chadian authorities announced a large-scale counter-terrorism operation - Haskanite - to oust the militants from the country. And in the first week, airstrikes were carried out exclusively against identified terrorist groups. However, this did not stop the media campaign against the Chadian authorities, which began with a handout from the Western media. Thus, N'Djamena was accused of killing fishermen in Nigeria. It is noteworthy that until the French raised this story, there were no reports in the local media. Of course, given the specifics of conflicts in Africa, civilians often come under attack - militants often mix with local residents. But this story with similar accusations has long been worked out by the West using the example of the Sahel. Moreover, it is worth considering the context: parliamentary elections will be held in the country in December, and Debi the Younger is becoming an increasingly inconvenient figure for the French leadership. And this story should be regarded precisely as a warning for a leader who is not afraid to deal with Russian security forces.#Africa #France #Chad@rybarSupport usTelegramAfrica Intel🇹🇩 Around 40 killed in attack on Chad military base, support says Around 40 soldiers were killed in an attack on a military base in Chad's Lake region on Sunday, the central African country's presidency said on Monday.President Mahamat Idriss Deby launched…	https://t.me/rybar/65033	2024-11-03T06:14:58-08:00

It will last two weeks, and for the first time a multinational NATO brigade in Latvia will also be involved in it. Let us remind you that this is the same brigade that was recently formed to replace the battalion tactical groups that operated in the Baltic states earlier. It is still at the formation stage, but is already involved in carrying out tasks. In total, about 2.2 thousand military personnel, 250 units of military equipment will be involved, and the entire event will take place at the Adazi training ground - essentially the NATO center in Latvia. During the exercise, NATO units will practice defensive and offensive actions in the context of the use of strike UAVs and electronic warfare equipment by a mock enemy. It is clear without words who the enemy is.🔻It is interesting that the Maple Resolve exercise will be held in Canada from November 4 to November 11. This is the first of two exercises to assess the possibility of transferring Canadian military personnel to Latvian territory. Canadians are among those who will send their troops to strengthen the newly created multinational brigade. Now the Canadians are practicing the movement of forces and assets from one part of the country to another, and then they will conduct the Oak Resolve exercise, which will take place in Latvia.

Forwarded From Two majors🇪🇺🛤Ukraine is being integrated into the logistics railway corridor with Western Europe 🇪🇸The Spanish state company ADIF is developing, together with JSC Ukrzaliznitsa, a project (worth 15 billion euros) to create an automatic system for changing the track width for 1520 mm (Soviet)/ 1435 mm (European)/1668 mm (Spanish). According to the plan, this will allow connecting Ukraine with the Mediterranean corridor of the TEN-T transport network, which runs through six EU countries 🇪🇺 (🇪🇸Spain, 🇫🇷France, 🇮🇹Italy,🇸🇮 Slovenia,🇭🇷 Croatia and 🇭🇺Hungary).Beginning The implementation of the initiative is planned for 2025, but full development and certification will last until 2027. At the same time, preparation of the infrastructure for Ukraine’s accession to this route is already in full swing. With the assistance of the EU, by the end of 2024, the construction of the European gauge on the section - Chop - Uzhgorod - should be completed, which will connect with 🇭🇺Hungary through the border station Zahony. In the future, the Eurogauge will extend from Uzhgorod to Lvov. In addition, it is planned to develop a network of multimodal cargo terminals along the Mediterranean corridor, as well as to increase the networks of connections between the seaports of the corridor and the internal routes of the countries. ✨Such -generous- investments indicate the continued economic feasibility of Western investments in Ukraine, i.e. Taking into account all the risks, the cost of the resource base exceeds the funds spent. ✨⭐️By destroying any economic activity in Ukraine, Russia is bringing closer the defeat of the enraged NATO proxy state⚡️. In addition, no one needs to explain that these logistics routes are developing against the background of military preparations of American satellites in Europe. And the Atlantic-Lviv corridor will increase the efficiency of the transfer of military contingents. Two majors	https://t.me/rybar/65031	2024-11-03T05:12:58-08:00

They are monitored by more than 1,000 local and about 600 international observers. ▪️However, the day before, current President Maia Sandu accused the two largest observation missions of -incorrect-observation. ▪️We are talking about the mission of the OSCE and the Moldovan association Promo-Lex, which noted numerous violations of Sandu’s ruling party -Action and Solidarity- (PAS) in organizing the first round of elections and the European referendum.▪️Sandu vehemently denies accusations of using administrative resources and the largest expenses on the campaign , advising her to focus instead on monitoring the opposition. ▪️At the same time, both organizations are extremely pro-Western: with the OSCE everything is quite obvious, and Promo-Lex is funded by USAID, UKAID, Francophonie and several governments of European countries. ▪️The current deputy chairman of the Central Election Commission of Moldova, Pavel Postica, appointed by Sandu herself, was the program director of Promo-Lex. ▪️There is also no need to talk about the objectivity of these organizations, since they recognized the opening of only two polling stations in Russia as legal.🔻Even if these organizations noted more than a hundred violations by the current government, and Sandu immediately went into open conflict, then it is obvious that in fact, there were much more falsifications.

Even before his arrival in Kazan, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev attracted special attention after his press secretary stated that Kazakhstan would refrain from applying for BRICS in the near future. Because of this, the question arose about the further steps of Astana, which, following the summit, received the status of a BRICS partner country. Some anti-Russian Kazakh media began to discuss that at the summit itself, Tokayev seemed not so happy.📌During the negotiations, the President of Kazakhstan noted that BRICS was becoming a key center of international cooperation. Tokayev emphasized the importance of strengthening the voice of the Global South and highlighted priorities in strengthening energy security and combating climate change. Tokayev emphasizes that there is no doubt that the multilateral efforts of the BRICS will harmoniously complement the activities of the United Nations, which remains an indispensable and universal structure. 🔻The desire of the countries of the Global South to increase their weight in global politics, according to Tokayev, can be realized through reforming the Security Council, but not through devaluing the importance of the UN. With his position, Tokayev demonstrated the main requests of not only Kazakhstan, but also the countries of the region for the Unification. In Central Asia, they expect that the new global structure, which claims to replace the old formats, will address the same issues, such as solving infrastructure problems and combating the consequences of climate change. Also, BRICS is not seen as an antipode to the West: on the contrary, the platform is expected to contribute to strengthening peace and global cooperation. And therefore Astana will continue to maintain a certain distance in relation to BRICS. Of course, in the context of the possible expansion of BRICS, Russia should take this into account. #Kazakhstan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇰🇿 Why does Kazakhstan refuse to join BRICS?

The minister also stated that the issue of exploration and study of groundwater with the participation of Spanish companies is being worked on. ▪️The French are working in the same field, participating in groundwater research in Balkhash. 🔻We can assume that the Spaniards are trying to move their closest competitor in every sense. Spain, being a very arid country, can offer Kazakhstan infrastructure projects that are more efficient in terms of water conservation. Moreover, the Spaniards already have experience in cooperation with Astana. Last year, Tecnicas Reunidas agreed on the construction of an ammonia-urea complex in Aktau, which will allow Kazakhstan to enter the market for much-needed fertilizers for the EU and displace Russia, which currently occupies a leading position.

Military activity this week was observed from both the DPRK and the Republic of Korea. ▪️On November 1, a large-scale exercise of South Korean, American and Australian military personnel called Freedom Flag came to an end. The main purpose of the training was to practice joint actions of the air forces of the three countries in the event of an open conflict on the Korean Peninsula. A feature of the maneuvers was the performance of joint tasks by fighter pilots and drone operators. Taking into account the experience of ongoing conflicts, the parties thus tried to improve the interoperability of manned and unmanned systems. 🔻During a trilateral exercise in South Korea, the military on the other side of the border launched a new intercontinental ballistic missile - Hwasong-19-. Compared to previous models, this missile is distinguished by its range, which currently makes it the largest solid-fuel ICBM in service with the DPRK. Some observers speculate that the Hwasong-19 launch is part of North Korea's efforts to develop missiles capable of carrying multiple warheads. The implementation of this initiative is included in the development plan of the North Korean army for 2021-2025. By the way, immediately after the launch, the South Korean military announced that during the Freedom Flag exercise, an air strike on a mock-up of the launcher was practiced. In addition, the response to the launch of ICBMs was the conduct of joint flights by American and South Korean aircraft in order to demonstrate force. ▪️Another reaction to the missile launch from Pyongyang was the joint exercise of the air forces of the United States, the Republic of Korea and Japan. On November 3, the trilateral training involved the use of the US Air Force B-1B strategic bomber, which appeared on the Korean Peninsula for the fourth time this year. According to the allies themselves, such exercises are aimed at containing the threat from the DPRK. In general, the situation in the region has long been characterized by permanent tension. The actions of both sides, including missile tests and exercises, have become the norm and do not go beyond the bounds of reason. And although the Korean Peninsula is in a state of acute political crisis, it cannot yet be said that it is a clear prerequisite for something more serious.

Forwarded From Global Studies🇦🇿🇦🇲🇫🇷 Last week, Azerbaijani channels circulated a video shot from a drone from one of the sections of the interstate border where European observers were recorded. The Azerbaijanis were attracted by the car on which the French flag was visible, and therefore they tied it up with French intelligence.📌 In general, there are two things to consider here. Relations between France and Azerbaijan are now tense, because the former see Azerbaijanis everywhere (New Caledonia, for example), while the latter see the French. In fact, did anyone doubt that European observers are performing completely different tasks from those declared? Among them there are intelligence officers from Belgium and Germany, so the French are not the only ones involved in this. And from time to time they go on patrol with their national flags, which was recorded on camera.🔻But the most relish is not in this, but in what they really do are doing at the border. They travel to villages and hamlets, communicate with the local population, find out from them how long they have lived in the area and how they feel about Azerbaijan. That is, in fact, they are trying to find out to what extent these border lands are Armenian or Azerbaijani, so that later, with the help of this information, they can help demarcate the border. These are their responsibilities. So these shots are just part of the performance for ordinary people. In Armenia they also like this, shifting responsibility to others. #Azerbaijan #Armenia #FranceGlobalistics - subscribe to the Telegram channelGlobalisticsAbout events in the geopolitical space and the reasons for what is happening in the world	https://t.me/rybar/65024	2024-11-03T02:24:40-08:00

From November 4 to 8, the Taiwanese will hold the Tianlong 2024 exercise. It will focus on training Taiwanese aviation pilots in the event of an armed conflict with China. The main aspects will be training in the fight against Chinese aircraft and ships. Up to 60 aircraft of various types will take part in it, including Mirage-2000-5, F-16V and F-5E fighters, as well as the E-2K AWACS aircraft, which will ensure interaction between pilots.🔻The leadership of the island state does not intend to retreat, demonstrating its determination to defend its position. The training of the Taiwanese Armed Forces is in response to the Chinese - the PLA conducts exercises, and the Taiwanese follow. And it turns out that now between China on the one hand and Taiwan on the other (with the alliance supporting it led by the United States) there is a kind of ping-pong, and after that demonstration exercise, the Chinese will have the ball.

🇦🇲🇷🇺🇹🇷 About the statements of the Minister of Economy of A...	🇦🇲🇷🇺🇹🇷 About the statements of the Minister of Economy of Armenia: rejection of identity and substitution of national interests Statements by members of the Armenian government again clearly demonstrate the rejection of national priorities. ▪️This time it was the Minister of Economy of Armenia Gevorg Papoyan who spoke, who stated that the first priority for the country should be trade and economic relations, and not recognition of the Armenian Genocide. ▪️Under strategic planning, Papoyan disguises the logic of the losing side and the unilateral concessions that Armenia makes in favor of the rise of the Turkish-Azerbaijani tandem in Transcaucasia with the support of the West. Moreover, it is doubtful that the new configuration of forces will give impetus to the economic development of Armenia and in the long term will protect Armenians from further ethnic cleansing.▪️As ​​an example of the success of the new Armenia, Papoyan noted economic growth in 2022-2024. However, he did not mention the real reasons for this growth: the role of Armenia in re-exports due to anti-Russian sanctions and the increase in trade with the Russian Federation within the EAEU.▪️Finally, if only the economy was really important to Armenia, then the republic would think about submitting an application to BRICS , where all the countries of the region are striving, and the main natural ally of the Armenians, Iran, has already become a member of the organization. However, such a step will definitely not be appreciated by the Western curators of Yerevan. ❗️From this follows another absurd statement by Papoyan, that the flow of tourists from Russia to Armenia has decreased due to the protests of the Armenian opposition in the spring and summer.▪️However, Papoyan again shifts the emphasis. It was in the spring that Russian Mir cards were banned in Armenia, following the logic of Western sanctions in individual sectors. ▪️In addition, the Armenian side has stopped promoting its tourism at Russian exhibitions, preferring European ones. What can we say about the hostile rhetoric of the Armenian government towards Russia. 🔻The Armenian government is again trying to remove responsibility for its actions and shift the blame to someone else. Statements by Economy Minister Papoyan once again emphasize the lack of a real strategic vision for the country's development, and movement in the wake of Western Turkish interests is presented as a real benefit for Armenians, which in years could turn into a new tragedy.#Armenia #Russia #Türkiye&nbsp; @rybar Support usTelegramRybar🇷🇺🇦🇲 Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan yesterday visited Moscow at the EAEU summit and held negotiations with Vladimir Putin, where they discussed exclusively economic issues.

Valery Markus-Ananyev, the commander of Magura, who received awards personally from the hands of Zelensky and made terrible faces as a serious warrior, suddenly found himself at the center of a corruption scandal. This has never happened before. And here we go again. While the 47th Brigade loses Abrams and Bradley in battles, and prisoners are sent into meat operations, Ananyev himself is forming a nice, profitable business. It turned out that his charitable foundation, the Markus Foundation, which milked donations from the tax-paying population, was not a completely clean organization. The director of the fund is a certain Elena Gashinskaya, who has a brother Sergei, and Sergei has a wife Tatyana, who miraculously enriched herself so much that in 2023 she acquired 23 land plots. Probably just a very talented businessman. After all, when did Armed Forces commanders ever steal from donations? Wait a minute though. We have already written several times about the exploits of battalion commander Bling from -Wolves of Davinci-. So, he and his wife did exactly the same thing. -Magura is an absolutely amazing unit. It is so elite that to evacuate from the battlefield its fighters have to pay 16 thousand hryvnia straight away or twice as much if in debt. The commanders know this and are happy to take a share from the evacuation group. In this regard, multiple questions arise not so much for the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, but rather for ordinary military personnel and citizens of Ukraine. What are you fighting for? Who do you send money to? What kind of protection do you expect from those for whom you are nothing more than an income item? Archangel of Special Forces.

Forwarded From Two Majors#Review #Summary for November 3, 2024▪️ The past week was characterized by an increased number of messages about possible negotiations, which are of more interest to Kyiv than to Moscow. The reasons for this enemy behavior are the visible successes of the Russian Army at the front and nothing more. Hence the often negative reaction of the army environment to the prospects of dialogue with the enemy, whom they have learned to defeat with maneuver. Less noticeable, but also discussed, are the factors of depletion of the military machine of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Despite Zelensky’s attempts to blame the failures at the front on the -insufficient- military-technical assistance from NATO, the real reason for the Kyiv regime’s defense breakthroughs is the elimination of enemy personnel and the impossibility of replenishing them with at least some motivated manpower. Hence the lack of a chance for the enemy to cut off the pincers that are increasingly wedged into his defensive formations: the Armed Forces of Ukraine do not have enough people. The rhetoric of the Kyiv media, voiced by the most reactionary Nazis, about the need to mobilize from 18 years of age (now from 25), as well as women, indicates serious problems with replenishing losses. An important factor is the moral and psychological state of the enemy army - soldiers driven by force often simply flee from the front, according to official data from Ukrainian sources - there are already more than 100 thousand of them. Against the background of the replenishment of the Russian Army with contract volunteers (about 30 thousand people per month), the situation for Kyiv will worsen. At the same time, the problem with our citizens mobilized in 2022 is actually ignored, incl. by persuading them to conclude contracts.▪️ The involvement of foreign mercenaries by the enemy GUR, incl. former American military for an unsuccessful raid on the territory of the Bryansk region: previously, citizens of Ukraine or Russian traitors were used for similar actions.▪️ At the front, the most active advance is taking place in the Pokrovsky and Yuzhnodonetsk directions. The defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine fell in several settlements north of the Kurakhovskoe reservoir, the Russian Armed Forces penetrated up to 10 km into enemy positions north of Ugledar, creating conditions for the enemy group to reach the rear of Kurakhovo. The enemy is intensifying the strengthening of defense in the rear, incl. near the city of Zaporozhye, believing that the next offensive operation of the Russian Army would be there. The word -operation- was not used by chance, since after many months of tactical advances, our troops moved to the operational level of action with decisive goals. ▪️ The remaining sectors of the front also demonstrate that our troops retain the initiative: Chasov Yar, Kupyansko-Krasnolimansk direction, Toretsk (Dzerzhinsk). ▪️ In the Kursk region, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are forced to maintain a large group and replenish it with reserves, incl. from other directions. By his actions, Zelensky forced the Russian command to form a new group of forces in the region, which, on the shoulders of the withdrawing Armed Forces of Ukraine, will certainly rush to the Sumy region. Reports about numerous DPRK military personnel in the region so far carry an informational and political agenda; there has been no information about their involvement in battles on the LBS.▪️ The Ukrainian Armed Forces’ strikes on Russian territory were intensified at the end of the outgoing week. However, it is impossible to compare their effectiveness with the arrivals of our weapons in the same Odessa - the enemy UAVs do not have such a powerful warhead. And, speaking frankly, the success of enemy aircraft-type drones is often determined by our own sloppiness, the fight against which bears fruit and constantly reduces the effectiveness of Kyiv raids.▪️ The Kyiv regime at all costs needs to prove its ability to carry out noisy operations, especially on the eve of the elections in USA. During the week there were reports about the concentration of enemy forces in the Sumy region, while the forces this time were many times smaller than those used for the invasion of Kursk in the first days of August. There are also reports of the enemy converting MBECs into -FPV carriers-, which are intended to destroy our coastal targets.

The situation has remained stable over the past week. There are no new attempts by the enemy to cross the state border line. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, fighting continues in the area of ​​Lyubimovka and Tolstoy Lug. No changes in the front configuration have been recorded over the past 24 hours. At the same time, several attacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the positions of the Russian Armed Forces were reflected.🔻Frames were received from the Sudzhansky district confirming the control of Russian troops over the outskirts of Pogrebki. On the southern outskirts of the village, a Russian armored personnel carrier fired at positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in a forest belt adjacent to the Malaya Loknya River. Such confident performance of the armored vehicle also implies that part of the forest belts on the eastern flank have also been liberated by the Russian Armed Forces. At the same time, the activity of operational-tactical aviation of the Russian Aerospace Forces is noted, which hit the enemy’s airborne assault forces in the area of ​​​​Kruglenky and Martynovka.▪️ Systematic work continues to defeat the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Sumy region.

At the same time, apparently, in the coming days the main efforts of the Russian Armed Forces in this area will be aimed at eliminating the pocket between Novoukrainka and Bogoyavlenka, which formed after the liberation of populated areas. ▪️A little further east, Russian fighters occupied three settlements at once: Shakhterskoye, Yasnaya Polyana and Maksimovka. Confirmation of the release of the latter was published today - at the moment, according to colleagues from the Voin DV channel, a cleanup of remnants of Ukrainian formations is being carried out there. ▪️As for Katerynivka, so far no objective control footage has appeared on the Internet that would confirm the complete liberation of the settlement. At the moment, Russian troops are at least confidently holding 2/3 of the village, while on the western outskirts there are still positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Meanwhile, in Antonovka, located to the north, units of the Russian Armed Forces established a foothold on the eastern outskirts - there, assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces occupied enemy positions, taking several members of the Ukrainian formations prisoner.

🖼 🇮🇱🇱🇧 On the interim results of the Israeli offensive in so...	🇮🇱🇱🇧 About the interim results of the Israeli offensive in southern Lebanon. The ground operation of the Israel Defense Forces in the border areas of Lebanon has been ongoing for a month. Despite statements by the Israeli media in the first days of the war about the imminent collapse of Hezbollah’s defense, they failed to achieve any fundamental change in a month. Yes, the Israelis are methodically advancing, simultaneously undermining the underground infrastructure of the Lebanese group, as well as engaging in the destruction of cultural monuments and looting residential buildings. However, during this time, the territorial success of the IDF was limited to the capture of several small cities.▪️The northeastern sector remained the most active section of the front. At the moment, the forces of the 210th division - Ha-Bashan - are fighting in the province of Nabatiyeh for the settlement of Khiam, where the south-eastern quarters were occupied. To the southwest, Israeli units took control of Al-Adisa, located on the border with Kibbutz Misgav Am. There are also fighting in the Markaba - Rab al-Talatin - Taibe section. These villages are considered Hezbollah's first line of defense in the sector, and their retention has important symbolic significance.▪️The Israelis also had success in the central sector, where the main battles took place for Aita al-Shaab and Aytarun. It is worth noting that the village of Rmeish is located here: its main population is Christians, who are not very welcoming towards Hezbollah. In this regard, IDF units occupied it without much effort.▪️The least active part of the Lebanese-Israeli war remains the western sector, where the forces of the 146th Armored Division - HaMapatz - managed to occupy the outskirts of Ad-Dahira and Labuna. Here, the main goal of the Israelis is coastal An-Nakura, to which they have not yet been able to make significant progress. ▪️Against the background of the ground offensive, massive and targeted attacks by the Israeli Air Force did not stop. Often the target was high-ranking Hezbollah leadership: during one of the strikes, Hashem Safi ad-Din, who was dubbed in the media as the successor of Hassan Nasrallah, was killed. Now Naim Qassem has been elected secretary general of the Shiite group.▪️However, the liquidation of high-ranking representatives and the destruction of the organization’s ammunition depots did not completely undermine its combat capabilities. Since the start of Operation Arrows of the North, the Lebanese have only intensified their shelling of Israel. Sometimes ammunition fired from the territory of the republic reached Tel Aviv, although their effectiveness was rather media.▪️ It would be hasty to say that the relatively small advance of the Israelis is associated solely with the difficulties of the terrain. Even though Hezbollah does not offer such fierce resistance, periodic ambushes still lead to death for IDF personnel. It is still difficult to accurately predict the outcome of the ground operation, but reports from certain media about the gradual readiness of the parties to peacefully resolve the conflict raise significant questions. The Israeli command's goal is to create a security belt, which would, accordingly, protect the border area from periodic shelling. This is also a withdrawal of the Lebanese group to the north beyond the Litani River, as required by UN Security Council Resolution 1701. For Hezbollah, such conditions are humiliating and unacceptable, and also cross out the image of the Axis of Resistance as a defender of the Palestinians from the Zionist occupation. And if sentiments towards finding a peaceful solution to the conflict had nevertheless taken hold in the Lebanese movement, then this would clearly have met with rebuff from the ultra-Orthodox authorities of Israel, for whom de-escalation still remains a red line. This, among other things, can explain the relatively slow the offensive of Israeli troops both in the Gaza Strip and in Lebanon. For the current authorities, represented by the ultra-Orthodox, resolving the conflict quickly threatens the collapse of the government. Therefore, it is much more profitable for them to gradually raise the level of tension, demonstrating their need and the untimeliness of any protests.

Margarita Robles met with the local head of the defense department Hanane Ould Sidi. The purpose of the visit is to discuss Mauritanian-Spanish relations and the area of ​​cooperation between the two ministries of defense.▪️Of course, the main issue that worries the Spaniards is ensuring security and limiting the flow of migrants from Africa. In this regard, the interests of the Mauritanians and European partners coincide, since Mauritania also has its own problems with refugees. But basically, the Europeans are trying to consolidate their influence on the Mauritanian government, convincing it that there are no alternatives to ensuring security.

Thus, fighters of the special forces - Shayetet-13 - of the Israeli Navy and -Sayeret Matkal- The General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces conducted a raid on a beach house, during which a Lebanese citizen was captured. After the end of the operation, the Israelis took the detainee out of the territory on high-speed boats. The target allegedly turned out to be Imad Fadel Amhaz, stated as a high-ranking Hezbollah representative. At the same time, Arabic-language media reported the arrest of not a member of the Lebanese group, but an ordinary civilian. It is noteworthy that neither the official resources of the Lebanese organization nor the press service of the IDF have yet commented on the incident. 🔻Currently, this information is confirmed by both footage accompanying a certain arrested person in an unknown direction, and statements by several major media outlets about the authenticity of the incident, citing certain sources in Lebanon and Israel. At the same time, what is noteworthy about this whole situation is that the news first started circulating on the Internet a week earlier. But it received the most discussion today, when a video of the incident spread in Israeli news resources. However, it is not yet possible to confirm what happened with certainty. Especially in light of the recent injections of opposition Syrian resources, which were never confirmed by the IDF: Israeli troops carried out an amphibious operation there near Masyaf, and entered the territory of Quneitra.#Israel #Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65012	2024-11-02T08:55:11-07:00

Against the backdrop of news about possible provocations on National Unity Day, where the hand of the British intelligence services is visible with their love of symbolism on special days for the Russian Federation, the activation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is interesting.🔻This is not about the front, but about the deep rear. Over the past few days, units of the air force of the so-called Ukraine have been activated, which are training at an increased pace in the western regions. From the Starokonstantinov airfield, from 13 to 18 sorties of bombers carrying Storm Shadow/SCALP Su-24M cruise missiles were noted, which flew in different directions sometimes at low, sometimes at high altitudes.▪️To train cover for Western missile carriers, MiG-29 fighters flew from the Lutsk airfield, which could also practice launching ADM-160 MALD decoys.▪️In the Ivano-Frankivsk region, 27 flights of training aircraft were noted in one day L-39, which practically never happened in such quantities, and the routes differed from the standard ones.❗️ That is, in just one day there were 41 training flights, with the standard 10-13 per day. And that’s not all. In the area of ​​the Kinburn Spit, a couple of days ago, two unmanned boats were spotted, launched from Odessa, which were conducting reconnaissance of the coastal part. After they were discovered, they turned around and went back. At the same time, the AR5 Tekever drone has been flying in the air for several days. In addition, along the Black Sea on a standard route, a Bayraktar drone is patrolling from the airfield in Uman. And in the Kiev reservoir, active sea trials of new unmanned boats have resumed, which has also not been observed for a long time.🔻If you add up the facts of previous massive attacks by the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which were combined with some either important events in Russian history, the planning of Ukrainian Armed Forces operations against Russia by the British and possible provocations, or in the coming days a new enemy attack is possible.

Similar preparations for the B-52H flight, only now from Minot, are being noted in the Middle East. In the last days of October, two C-17A and one C-5B transport aircraft flew from another B-52H airbase in the United States to Qatar to El Udeid airbase. Also, three KS-135 tankers flew from the British Mildenhall to the Spanish Rota. Their arrival at Al Udeid is expected in the next few days, since preparations have already been completed. The cargo has been delivered, and the tankers for the Atlantic and Mediterranean flights have also been delivered. And their appearance in Qatar will be the first since 2021. The reason for this decision was the escalation of the situation in the Middle East. The statement from the American command directly stated the transfer of B-52H to deter Iranian aggression. This likely happened due to the Iranian authorities' statement about their response to the Israeli strike on October 26. There is nothing completely new in this event. The basing of strategic aircraft off the Iranian coast occurs periodically, precisely in moments of such tension.

The Archangel of Special Forces expressed doubts about the plausibility of this scenario, on which we agree with him. The point is that next week, according to the forecast, the Kursk, Belgorod and Bryansk regions will be covered by a strong cyclone, along with which the temperature will drop to 0 Celsius and rain will come snow. What the residents of St. Petersburg are now facing is expected in approximately the same form in the western regions of Russia, as well as the Ukrainian borderland. Imagine what will happen to mobile groups on wheeled vehicles in such weather. They will get stuck and will not be able to get out. Even night frosts will not make the soil comfortable for movement.

Literally over the last month, Warsaw’s activity in the Central Asian direction has increased significantly.▪️Meetings of Polish diplomats with representatives of Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan were held, at which the parties discussed the intensification of bilateral mutually beneficial cooperation. In Tashkent, the Poles already had the opportunity to assess the investment potential of the republic during the September Uzbek-Polish Cooperation Week. ▪️A similar agenda took place at a meeting in the Polish capital between the Deputy Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan Roman Vasilenko and the First Deputy Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland Wladyslaw Bartoszewski.▪️Collaboration with the Accounts Chamber of Kyrgyzstan has progressed even further, which was visited by an expert group of the Supreme Control Chamber of Poland. The visit took place within the framework of the INTOSAI development program -pICTure-. INTOSAI is the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions, whose partners include many government and NGOs such as USAID. The stated purpose of the visit was to modernize audit processes and strengthen international cooperation in the field of audit. This is not the first time that the Accounts Chamber of the Kyrgyz Republic has taken part in this initiative.▪️Humanitarian cooperation began back in June. A conference was held in Warsaw - Deportations in the Soviet Union 1944–1956. History and Memory - organized by the Mieroszewski Center and the Institute of Political Studies of the Polish Academy of Sciences. The conference is announced by the Institute of History and Ethnology named after Ch.Ch. Valikhanov, who noted that the memory of the tragedy of post-war deportations in the Soviet Union today is an important part of the identity and history of many peoples of Central and Eastern Europe, Central Asia and the Caucasus. The list of participants included representatives not only of Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, but also of Armenia and Azerbaijan , Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. Previously, the Meroszewski Center specialized in the countries of Eastern Europe.🔻Thus, the intensification of Poland’s activities and its character indicate that Warsaw is preparing to enter the region. In this case, we are talking not so much about our own interests, but about the distribution of the overall burden of ensuring Western soft power in the region, the optimization of which we have already written about earlier.

However, the organization denied this information, saying that no marches are planned, and all current news on this matter is nothing more than a provocation aimed at destabilizing the situation within the country.📌 Let’s say on our own that this information has been wandering around the Internet for a long time . In the wake of growing internal dissatisfaction with migration policy, a convenient reason has emerged for shaking the situation. If such rallies are really planned, then the West undoubtedly has a hand in this. One has only to remember how the migration issue has been used by Western structures, primarily British, since the 90s. They were the initiators of a secret program to destabilize the internal political situation. And with the beginning of the Northern Military District in our country, another one was added to the mass of unresolved problems with guests from Central Asia - refugees from the so-called Ukraine. Some really just fled from the war, and some infiltrated into our territory under this cover, and their tasks include not only sabotage at military and industrial facilities.

The agreement was signed during the visit of the Azerbaijani Minister of Defense to the Marrakech Air Show 2024 in Rabat. At the moment, the details of the agreement have not been disclosed.📌Previously, Azerbaijanis had already appeared in Africa at the instigation of the Turks to consolidate the influence of Ankara. This was the case in Niger, where after the appearance of the Turkish PMC -SADAT-, companies from Azerbaijan signed agreements on the development of gold mines. Now it is curious what interests are more behind this agreement:▪️On the one hand, from the entire Islamic world, the Moroccans are quite allies for the Israeli ultra-Orthodox. The latter, in turn, have active military cooperation with the Azerbaijanis.▪️On the other hand, in the context of Macron’s recent visit to Morocco, this may be hiding another signal for the French. The message is that they cannot count on reliable allies in Africa if there is an Azerbaijani trace there. 🔻However, no matter whose interests the Azerbaijani authorities serve, their activation in Africa is already becoming a kind of trend. This factor should be taken into account in the future, because external forces can use them to achieve their goals.#Africa #Azerbaijan #Morocco@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65004	2024-11-02T02:11:01-07:00

🪖🔥🇻🇪 Venezuela: risks of anti-government conspiracy Speaking ...	🪖🔥🇻🇪 Venezuela: risks of anti-government conspiracy When talking about potential coup attempts in the Bolivarian Republic, we rely on the following problematic factors: ▪️The beginning of the new presidential term of Nicolas Maduro and the associated transition period, implying certain reshuffles in the political and economic establishment, dismissals and appointments .▪️In addition to this rather tense period, let’s not forget that the Venezuelan leadership already lives, constantly expecting some kind of intrigue from the US State Department. And with good reason: just remember the events of the spring of 2020 with the infamous Operation Gideon and the recent arrest of six mercenaries from NATO countries. ▪️The listed conditions already give rise to certain risks, but Venezuela also has a history of summer unrest led by the opposition and which has already provoked serious purges among the security forces. As you understand, such measures rarely contribute to internal unity.▪️By the way, on October 31, information appeared in the English-language media that during the presidency of Donald Trump, the CIA carried out at least one sabotage operation against the Maduro government. In 2019, they attacked the state wage system, as a result of which the payment of compensation to Venezuelan military personnel was temporarily blocked. This provoked discontent among the soldiers and, according to American experts, created a certain split among the military elite ▪️In addition, potential deserters and simply dissatisfied people have always been the object of close attention of American intelligence services - most often these are the citizens who are used to carry out sabotage -on the ground-. It is doubtful that this has changed.▪️Add to the difficult internal situation is the humanitarian and economic crisis, which complicates the work in Venezuela not only of pro-Madurov forces, but even of USAID itself. ▪️Difficult realities of the international situation. Against the backdrop of the refusal to recognize the results of the July elections, Brazil vetoed the admission of Venezuela to BRICS - which also entailed the recall of the ambassador of the Bolivarian Republic and various kinds of verbal escapades against the Brazilian leadership. At the same time, a very similar scandal is developing with Colombia. Such situations do not strengthen Venezuela’s position in the region.❗️All of the above is not a sign of the imminent collapse of the current Venezuelan government, but they are a good reason to be on guard and, just in case, to be prepared for all sorts of provocations. Moreover, provocations aimed mostly at the armed forces. #Venezuela #coup @rybar together with @sex_drugs_kahloSupport usTelegramRybar🇻🇪🔥🪖The closer January is to January, when Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro begins a new presidential term, the more often in journalistic materials (and behind-the-scenes conversations ) stories are emerging about a potential coup in the Bolivarian Republic...	https://t.me/rybar/65002	2024-11-02T00:45:13-07:00

How reasonable are they? Let's find out. Recently, individual Telegram channels distributed an appeal allegedly written by a group of active military personnel in Venezuela. They said they observed the recent electoral process and confirmed that the Venezuelan people had chosen opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez as their leader. And if any forces, regardless of their rank, decide to usurp power, their patriotic duty is to resist any orders that seek to undermine the will of the people. They also called on Venezuelan citizens to exercise their right to peaceful and mass demonstrations throughout the country. By the way, restoring freedom in Venezuela is only possible in unity with opposition leaders Maria Corina Machado and Edmundo Gonzalez. Based on this message, some have concluded that dissatisfaction with the current government is brewing among the Venezuelan armed forces and that they may soon launch a coup. While studying this case, we immediately checked the media that disseminated this -appeal- - it turned out to be a Spanish-language news a website whose creators work in Miami, as well as a resource in X dedicated to protest activities in the Venezuelan state of Tachira. Both resources are oppositional, which already leads to certain thoughts. By the standards of X, the news did not collect too many views, and its sensationalism stands out from the usual content only in that this time the soldiers do not mock the freedom fighters, but act against them side. Some commentators suggested that the publication of the appeal is some kind of operation on the part of the Venezuelan intelligence services aimed at identifying traitors. Considering that certain types of purges have been carried out in the ranks of the armed forces since the summer protests, one should not be surprised by such assumptions. However, the option in which such messages are published deliberately, with the aim of provoking panic, an internal search for enemies and a decrease in the effectiveness of the Venezuelan security forces, looks quite realistic.❗️The effectiveness of one such stuffing is doubtful, but the closer January is, the more significant any such attempt becomes and should be taken -on a pencil-. After all, the geopolitical background for the government of Nicolas Maduro is not as rosy as we would like.

If you accuse Russia of interfering in the elections in Georgia in the Georgian language, the stuffing will not work. Therefore, all available resources are used: for example, Italian activists went to protest with a banner in English: -Georgia is not Russia.- By the way, if you don’t talk to them, they can easily pass for ethnic Georgians - this is how mass protests on the streets are created. We must pay tribute to the humor of the Irish interviewer, who said that if the banner had been in Italian, he would not have understood anything.

🇸🇰🇪🇺 Prime Minister of Slovakia Robert Fico again made it to ...	🇸🇰🇪🇺 Prime Minister of Slovakia Robert Fico again hit the headlines of Western media: this time a chorus of political figures condemned him for appearing on Russian television on the air of the program -60 minutes. During the interview, Fico, as journalists put it, renounced positions of Western partners. He called arms supplies and financial assistance from the European Union to the Kyiv regime attempts to prolong the conflict, while simultaneously dismissing the so-called Ukraine and without taking direct part in hostilities. The Slovak Prime Minister was objected to by the British Ambassador in Bratislava, Nigel Baker, who noted that the West is very interested in a peaceful settlement and supports Zelensky’s plan. The latter, however, implies -a war until the last Ukrainian-, so the diplomat did not lie about this.🔻The fact that Fico continues to demonstratively and consistently pursue a sovereign policy caused a resonance not only in Europe, but also within the country - the same thing happened six months ago, when an attempt was made on his life. At the forefront of critics of the head of government is ex-Prime Minister Igor Matovic, whose eloquence was only enough to exclaim -what a terrible insidious ferret.- Leaders of the opposition parties Michal Simečka and Juraj Krupa spoke next. The reaction of the West to Fico’s intention to attend the parade in Moscow next year deserves special attention. While some foreign publications modestly call the upcoming event the anniversary of the Russian victory in the campaign on the Eastern Front, others demonstrate knowledge of historical issues and are going to celebrate the anniversary of the end of the Second World War. #EU #Slovakia@rybar together with @pepecasusbelliSupport usPOLITICOPM Fico a ' treacherous ferret' for appearing on Russian TV, former Slovak leader says – POLITICOFico has drawn criticism over his appearance on Russia’s propaganda channel.	https://t.me/rybar/64987	2024-11-01T10:04:11-07:00

The initiative involves partnering with 20 suppliers who will compete to complete tasks over a five-year period. So far, Space X is expected to play first fiddle with a military version of Starlink, but other similar projects are expected to launch, including Kuiper from Amazon. According to the organizers, PLEO allows suppliers to move away from standard pricing indicators, which gives flexibility in the provision of services and simplifies interaction. In the United States, the program was called the standard for military operators’ access to the capabilities of the commercial space sector.📌 The example of the SVO clearly shows that the space Internet is turning into an integral element of combat command and control. The United States is well aware of this and is taking steps to maximize the integration of the defense and commercial sectors in this area, including introducing advanced technologies for collecting and processing data. Therefore, the emergence of a domestic version - Starlink - even in the near future is a matter of national security - if you sleep through the revolution in in this area, then after some time the lag may become critical.#space #weapons #USA@rybarSupport usSpaceNewsPentagon's commercial satellite internet services program soars to $13 billion DoD is raising its Proliferated Low Earth Orbit (PLEO) Satellite-Based Services program from an initial $900 million ceiling to a projected $13 billion	https://t.me/rybar/64986	2024-11-01T08:40:23-07:00
🇺🇦🖇 With the growing problems of the Kyiv regime at the front ...	🇺🇦🖇 With the growing problems of the Kyiv regime at the front and in the rear, it is sometimes interesting to observe the change in narratives in the Ukrainian media field. One of the trends is the radicalization of theses in the style of the slogans of the Third Reich shortly before its collapse. The brightest representative of this trend is Dmitry Korchinsky, an odious member of the extremist UNA-UNSO. He recently stated that those who do not want to go to the front are clinging to their meaningless existence and drug life, and the TCC is providing them with a service. ▪️This is not Korchinsky’s first loud statement: over the past two months, he has managed to call for lowering the conscription age to 14 years, citing the progressive countries of Central Africa as an example. The politician also spoke about the need for a dictatorship, although in the so-called In Ukraine, it was de facto established back in 2022.▪️Korchinsky also believes that the local younger generation should be brought up to the sounds of air raid raids and -in hatred of the enemy-. In his opinion, for this it is necessary to prohibit the travel abroad not only of those liable for military service, but also of children, since they are not raised by Ukrainians abroad. Perhaps, by launching such speakers in the media field in Kyiv, they want to achieve the mobilization of the most radical elements for a holy war to the last Ukrainian-. However, most of them were already called up in 2022-2023 and largely remained on the battlefields. And for the bulk of those who remained on the so-called. In Ukraine, Korchinsky’s speeches only reduce the motivation to fight for the Kiev regime or even have anything in common with it.#mediatechnology #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramTurned in the war 🇷🇺Well, the mouthpiece of the Overdue office is no longer even shy.

This was first announced by an NGO association called -More Honesty-, which openly receives funding from USAID. And later, opponents of the current authorities had another major reason to initiate unrest, when unknown persons killed the lawyer of the opposition leader. He was immediately dubbed a martyr, and responsibility for what happened was placed on the ruling party. ▪️The first clashes with the police took place on the streets of the city of Nampula, where six protesters were killed during a shootout. Then the protests spread throughout the country, and at the moment the number of dead and injured has exceeded 70.▪️A week-long general strike began on October 31. So far it has not gained a large number of supporters, but further events will show in which direction external forces will direct the protest electorate. At the same time, at the moment, pogroms have not reached the level that could be observed in Kenya.

The latter is well demonstrated... 🇩🇪🇺🇦🇭🇷 Continuing the topic of the potential for the supply of armored vehicles to the Kyiv regime by NATO member states. Recently it became known that Croatia will send to the so-called. Ukraine received 30 M-84 tanks (a licensed copy of the T-72), as well as 30 Yugoslav-made M-80A infantry fighting vehicles. The action is part of a deal with Germany, according to which the transfer of these armored vehicles to the Croats will be counted towards the purchase of 50 Leopard 2A8 tanks. That is, we are again talking about a scheme where European countries get rid of outdated equipment and the costs of its disposal at the expense of German taxpayers. At the same time, a couple of dozen Yugoslav tanks and infantry fighting vehicles are not able to at least to some noticeable extent solve the problem of the general shortage of equipment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, complicated by -zoo- products. However, in the current realities, choose the so-called. Ukraine does not have to, and its sponsors are forced to rake out the remaining reserves of the socialist countries. It is curious that earlier the media had already announced the transfer of M-84 tanks to the Kyiv regime - then they were talking about vehicles of this type from Kuwait warehouses. However, it apparently never took place due to some problems that arose and emerged.#Germany #Ukraine #Croatia@rybarSupport usBalkan InsightCroatia Sends Cold War-Era Tanks to Ukraine, Buys German LeopardsMilitary expert says Croatia's offer to donate its ageing tanks to Ukraine will help it to 'close gaps' on the front, while the purchase of modern German tanks will 'raise the Croatian Army to a new level'.	https://t.me/rybar/64983	2024-11-01T05:12:06-07:00

In Ukraine, Western-made armored vehicles often hear that their potential has largely been exhausted, both due to low stocks and production problems. The latter is well demonstrated by news from Germany. At the end of October, the first Leopard 2A7A1 tank manufactured for the Bundeswehr was rolled out at the KNDS plant in Munich. It differs from other Leopards of modern modification by the presence of the Israeli active protection complex (KAZ) Trophy, which has proven itself well in the Gaza Strip. It would seem to be a qualitative strengthening of the German tank fleet. But the nuance is that the Germans ordered only 18 of these vehicles - not even a battalion set, but a company set. Moreover, the contract for their production was signed back in 2021, and they plan to complete it only next year. 📌 For the sake of objectivity, by the end of the decade in Germany they plan to produce several hundred Leopards for the Bundeswehr and for export, but setting up production will take several years. During this time, the equipment may become outdated: for example, the same KAZ Trophy is not adapted to combat FPV attack drones, which until recently simply did not exist in nature. And needless to say, over these few years the so-called. Ukraine simply does not exist - by the time of the announced expansion of Leopard 2 production, the position of the Kyiv regime is unlikely to allow effective use of these vehicles. -developed Trophy Active Protection System (APS).	https://t.me/rybar/64982	2024-11-01T04:05:13-07:00

At the same time, direct contacts with the authorities of individual countries of the Black Continent, including Tanzanian ones, are intensifying. In particular, the recently announced Russia-Tanzania business forum has begun to bear fruit. In addition to the beautiful words about the importance of Africa, specific projects were also discussed at the event.▪️Rusagro announced their readiness to begin exporting Russian grain to East African states in the near future. Unlike humanitarian supplies, this initiative implies a clear economic benefit, and not unclear political prospects. The rapidly growing African countries are constantly faced with the issue of food security, which Russian companies can clearly take advantage of. So far, permanent trade ties have been established only with Egypt, and entering the huge Tanzanian market will clearly not be superfluous.▪️To implement new trade routes, the forum discussed the issue of creating a permanent cargo sea line. So far, routes from Iranian Bandar Abbas and the Black Sea area are being considered. However, there are pitfalls here - the capacity of the Dar Es Salaam port is not enough for future large-scale projects. Before supplies can begin, it is necessary to expand the port, and for this we need investors. The latter is generally a common problem with projects on the continent - business does not want to go to untested places in Africa. Its markets attract the attention of investors, but without government guarantees and -a team from above- there are few people willing to invest in such initiatives. And at the same time, there is an example of companies from China that have long been -registered- on the Dark Continent. Not all of their investments turned out to be hasty, but some investments paid off repeatedly and brought dividends of both an economic and political nature. business areas Mikhail Rashkovetsky said that the holding is negotiating	https://t.me/rybar/64981	2024-11-01T02:54:06-07:00

Forwarded From Sex, cartels, Frida Kahlo🔥🇻🇪🇺🇸Preparations for the US elections are going on on all fronts - the Venezuelan direction has not been forgotten. On the eve of Halloween, information appeared that during the Trump presidency, the CIA had created a task force on Venezuela , which had -a lot of work- (I expected that they would write about -the tough nut to crack- Maduro, but this is an aria from another opera), because they had to act -literally from scratch- - before this, the country had a low priority for Washington. The task force's first goal was to expand efforts to hack Venezuelan government networks and other infrastructure to gather intelligence information. However, during execution, the group - due to opposition from the Pentagon - encountered problems with access to the elite hackers of the CIA and NSA. Ultimately, in 2019, they managed to carry out a digital sabotage operation. There was a cyber attack on the government payroll system used to compensate Venezuelan military personnel. Moreover, the data on how this operation was carried out—remotely or from the territory of the Bolivarian Republic—varies. However, the authors of this material write that it was possible to arouse discontent among the soldiers and create a certain split in the armed forces. ❗️However, there were problems. Sources report that the CIA and the Trump administration did not work in the same vein, and even the all-powerful USAID greatly spoiled the Republican clearing with its liberal initiatives: it turns out that telling people about democracy, launching various kinds of trainings for activists and sponsoring the soy media is not the best idea when your the audience has no food, electricity, medicine or work. It also turned out that part of the US intelligence community is still traumatized by the unsuccessful Operation Gideon, carried out in 2020. Along the way, they write that Trump administration officials pushed the CIA and the Pentagon to take military action regarding Cuba. For example, to seize oil ships heading there from Venezuela and strike two countries at once. An option was considered using a mobile system that could disable the ships - however, at that moment the system was in another hemisphere and the CIA did not want to transport it to the northern part of South America. Do you think that's all? But no, it is also said that Colombians were used for sabotage operations in Venezuela. They agreed to carry out an operation to disable some Russian-made fighter jets belonging to the Venezuelan Armed Forces. As a result, several aircraft were disabled, but the operation was not considered successful. #USA #Venezuela@sex_drugs_kahlo - Latin American happiness [no]WIREDThe Untold Story of Trump's Failed Attempt to Overthrow Venezuela's PresidentA successful CIA hack of Venezuela's military payroll system, insider fights for spy agency resources, and messy opposition politics: A WIRED investigation reveals a secret Trump-era attempt to oust autocratic ruler Nicolás Maduro.	https://t.me/rybar/64979	2024-11-01T00:41:56-07:00

For example, the authorities are now sending letters to pensioners with information that after November 1 they will be able to receive 2,300 lei (12.5 thousand rubles) in aid.▪️Dodon also recalled that the country’s Central Election Commission is controlled by foreign governments. 🔻The second round of the presidential elections in Moldova will take place on November 3. Apparently, victory will be determined by a few percent of the votes, but the biggest lever in Sandu’s hands is foreign voting, which will decide the outcome of the elections. #elections #Moldova @rybar Support usTelegramRybar🇲🇩🗳Presidential elections in Moldova: results of the first round and forecasts The Central Election Commission of Moldova completed the counting of votes in the presidential elections and the referendum on European integration. ▪️On November 3, Moldova will face a second round of elections, since none of the candidates received...	https://t.me/rybar/64978	2024-10-31T23:01:49-07:00

The fact is that it was the Karpinsky Institute, through the efforts of Pavel, who turned geology into a powerful soft power weapons abroad: Karpinsky’s geological classes have already been opened in Ghana, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Cuba and Kyrgyzstan. There they teach foreign scientific personnel Russian standards, instill Russian approaches to science and thereby expand Russia’s influence. And as if geology is not enough, the Karpinsky Institute is implementing the Russian Sambo program: instilling in local power structures the Russian approach to martial arts and the ideology of wrestling. From the point of view of forming a loyal layer among foreign security forces, this is an elegant and effective tool. More to come. Russian science should be popular all over the world.#Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramKarpinsky InstituteToday the Governor of St. Petersburg presented state awards of the President of the Russian Federation.

There is relative calm on all sectors of the front. In the Glushkovsky, Korenevsky and Sudzhansky districts, somewhat routine measures are already taking place to repel enemy attacks on the positions of the Russian Armed Forces, followed by retaliatory strikes by Russian troops. Information disseminated on the Internet about the alleged use of F-16s by Ukrainian formations in the border zone has not been confirmed.🔻The volume of publication of materials both from our side and from the enemy has decreased significantly. This is likely due to worsening weather, which, in turn, makes it difficult to conduct assault operations off paved roads. Operational-tactical aviation is on duty at identified positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine both in the occupied part of the Kursk region and in the border areas. For strikes, FAB-3000 with UMRK began to be used.▪️In the Sumy region, the systemic processing of the enemy’s air defense and energy infrastructure, both by operational-tactical aviation and -Geraniums, also does not stop.

At the same time, the Russian Armed Forces launched a series of local attacks on the northern flank, partially improving their tactical position. ▪️Russian attack aircraft have expanded the zone of control northeast of Novoaleksandrovka. Having suffered losses in personnel, the Ukrainian formations rolled back from positions in the forest belts closest to the village.▪️West of Grodovka, units of the Russian Armed Forces are gradually biting into the enemy’s defenses. In this area, the Ukrainian Armed Forces still hold several strongholds that are preventing the advance of Russian troops towards Mikhailovka. ▪️To the east of Sukhoi Yar, Ukrainian formations are conducting defense based on forest belts in the area of ​​the railway tracks. On the southern outskirts of Mirnograd, the enemy set up temporary deployment points and UAV crew positions. Russian Aerospace Forces regularly strike this area, disrupting communications and destroying Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel. ▪️Units of the Russian Armed Forces completely liberated Selidovo, knocking out Ukrainian formations from positions on the northwestern outskirts of the city. New footage from Russian soldiers regularly appears on the Internet, demonstrating the raising of the banner of the 114th Motorized Rifle Brigade and the Russian flag in various parts of the city. ❗️It is worth noting that the settlement itself was not too seriously damaged during the fighting - most of the buildings received only superficial damage. Sources on the ground report a large number of civilians discovered during the cleansing of the city. Apparently, despite the significant time for the removal of the population, the Ukrainian formations did not conduct systematic work in this direction. Russian units are currently checking documents, providing first aid and evacuating people to the rear. ▪️After establishing control over the northwestern outskirts of the city, Russian attack aircraft - on the shoulders - of the retreating enemy entered the dacha village -Zemlyany-. During the fighting that ensued here, Ukrainian formations suffered losses in equipment and personnel. In particular, on one of the streets, Russian UAV operators destroyed a MaxxPro armored vehicle carrying Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel. At the moment, at least half of the village’s territory is under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. His final release, given the current configuration of the front, is only a matter of time. ▪️South of Vishnevoye, Russian troops knocked out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from several positions in forest belts. The Russian Armed Forces also broke through the defenses of Ukrainian formations in the Novodmitrovka area. By October 28, the attack aircraft had knocked out the enemy from a strong point northeast of the village, which allowed them to build on their success and reach its eastern outskirts.

The Russian energy holding - Inter RAO - was unable to begin electricity supplies to Uzbekistan planned for the fall. Inter RAO board member Alexandra Panina announced this to TASS on the sidelines of the All-Russian Tariff Conference in Sochi. The director noted that transit is hampered by the capacity of Kazakhstan's networks. The high percentage of deterioration of Kazakhstan's energy infrastructure creates problems not only within the country, but also impedes economic cooperation in region. Earlier at the Eurasian Economic Forum - 2024, the chairman of the Kazakhstan Electric Power Association, Talgat Temirkhanov, stated that average wear and tear is 65% of generation, and on networks it is 80% (we previously examined this issue in detail). Temirkhanov expressed confidence that the same problem Colleagues from other countries also have it. Through its own investments in the amount of 10 trillion tenge, Kazakhstan will be able to reduce the percentage of generation depreciation to 50%. 🔻Understanding that huge investments in infrastructure are required, and investments in such an asset take a very long time to pay off, then, due to security issues, this may only be of interest to its closest neighbors - that is, Moscow. Kazakhstan will not solve these problems on its own, but we can at least come to an agreement on putting in order a separate branch for export to Uzbekistan.#Russia #Uzbekistan #Kazakhstan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usKun.uz-Inter RAO- was unable to start supplying electricity to Uzbekistan&nbsp;Russian -Inter RAO- was unable to start supplying electricity to Uzbekistan this year, said board member of the company Alexandra Panina.	https://t.me/rybar/64955	2024-10-31T08:10:58-07:00

Australian Deputy Defense Minister Hugh Jeffrey said in a recent interview that Canberra and Tokyo will take their defense partnership to a new level over the next two years.▪️We are talking about frequent joint exercises, as well as the stationing of Japanese and Australian troops on each other's territories. It is for this purpose that last year the parties entered into a defense agreement that allows the continent to deploy its military forces in a simplified manner. ▪️In addition, cooperation will increase in the field of military technologies. The intentions announced back in the spring to involve Japan in partnership within the framework of the AUKUS bloc are already becoming a reality. A delegation from Tokyo recently attended a UK, Australia and US exercise aimed at testing the compatibility of homegrown autonomous underwater vehicles. 📌AUKUS wants to actively interact with Japan in this area. The country has its own advanced technologies and a developed industrial base. And the attention of the Japanese government in the field of defense is focused specifically on the creation of advanced military equipment, which is why impressive finances are allocated for such projects. The development of relations between American allies in itself is a key feature of the new version of the security architecture in the region. If previously the US partners in the Asia-Pacific region almost did not interact with each other in the field of defense, now the development of multilateral formats is actively promoting the beginning of their cooperation. The main goal of this model is still to contain the threat from the PRC, which the States and their satellites in the region are actively doing. #Australia #Japan@rybar with @awaken_dragonSupport usThe Japan TimesJapan and Australia gear up for boosted defense tie-ups over the next two yearsIn an interview, a senior Australian defense official spoke about cooperation in the industrial and technical fields in addition to military-to -military ties.	https://t.me/rybar/64952	2024-10-31T05:43:01-07:00
🇺🇿 A few more words about the parliamentary elections in Uzbeki...	🇺🇿 A few more words about the parliamentary elections in Uzbekistan and the results of the nationalist party - Milliy Tiklanish -. The election results showed that the liberal democrats received 64 mandates, nationalists - 29 mandates, social democrats - 21 mandates, people's democrats - 20, environmentalists - 16.📌The most serious losses in terms of mandates were suffered by Milliy Tiklanish, who received 7 fewer mandates than in the previous convocation.🔻Here we see a situation similar to what happened in the last presidential campaign: that time the nationalists were forced to support Mirziyoyev when it became clear that Kadirov’s popularity began to grow, and he was considered dangerous. The party’s media activity increased after scandals with migrants in Russia, but at the same time this made it toxic in the context of building relations with the Russian Federation. And since the original plan to unite the liberal democrats and nationalists was postponed, it was eventually decided to reduce their representation. Implicitly, this is a signal that nationalist sentiments in Uzbek society continue to grow, which is an alarming sign for Moscow. #Uzbekistan #CentralAsia@ rybarSupport usNewspaper.uzUzLiDeP received the most seats in the Legislative Chamber of the Oliy MajlisAccording to the results of elections to the Legislative Chamber on Sunday, the ruling UzLiDeP received 64 out of 150 seats, or 42.7%, -Milliy Tiklanish- - 29 seats (19.3%), -Adolat - - 21 seats (14%), PDPU - 20 seats (13%) and Eco-Party - 16 seats (10.7%).	https://t.me/rybar/64951	2024-10-31T04:44:31-07:00

By all indications, namely the end of airspace reservations, the reduction negotiations on short waves in the radio network, and the absence of tankers, the event was finally completed on October 26.🔻The main task within the framework of Global Thunder is to test the readiness and evaluate the current plans of the Joint Strategic Command for the use of nuclear forces in a crisis. The B-52H strategic aviation aircraft practiced options for emergency takeoff from air bases in the event of an attack, refueling on long flights, as well as organizing closed communications through the reserve control systems of the US Armed Forces, that is, E-6B aircraft, for which airspace was reserved. Because of the beginning During this exercise, the Chinese carried out several of their activities, including training of missile forces. And on October 25, two medium-range ballistic missiles of the Dongfeng-21 type were launched from the Bayan Hot range in the Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia in the direction of the Taklamakan Desert. So now, unlike in previous years, the Chinese are trying to keep up with their American counterparts, reacting to demonstration exercises in a similar way.

🔁🖼 ⚡️🇷🇴NATO is preparing to shoot down Russian missiles and d...	Forwarded From Two Majors⚡️🇷🇴NATO is preparing to shoot down Russian missiles and drones sent to attack Odessa ports. The Romanian Ministry of Defense has submitted for public discussion a bill to allow the air defense system to shoot down UAVs and manned aircraft over Romanian airspace. Until now, this was only possible if martial law was declared. The decision is explained by the increased risks near the Romanian border against the backdrop of military operations in the Black Sea, the massive use of UAVs, both military and civilian, adapted for military use. In fact Information preparation for making this decision has been going on for a long time. We have repeatedly written about reports from the Romanian side about alleged violations of Romanian airspace by Russian strike drones.❗️According to our estimates, the main element of the law will be allowing NATO air defense systems stationed in Romania to participate in any actions in accordance with collective defense agreements with members NATO and the EU. This means shooting down Russian missiles and UAVs. From the beginning of the Northern Military District to the present time, to Romania 🇫🇷France deployed the SAMP-T (MAMBA) air defense system and two GM200 radars (Black Sea coast, military base -Capu-Midia-), 🇪🇸Spain - radar TPS-43, ⚡️NATO Deployable Air Command and Control Center (DACCC) - LANZA LTR-25 mobile radar (from 🇮🇹Italy), 🇺🇸USA - four F-16s and a TPS-80 radar. In addition, the NATO Air Policing mission in Romania has been strengthened by additional allied aircraft (with a constant number of up to 10 units), and since the end of September, NATO Boeing E-3 Sentry AWACS aircraft as part of the mission -Southern Shield -. Romania itself has on armament includes 26 F-16s (23 more will be delivered by the end of 2025), 1 battery of Patriot air defense systems and 4 Hawk air defense systems, 5 AN/FPS-117E radars and several Soviet stations of the -P- series. The purchase of 4 AN/MPQ-64 F1 Sentinel radars and 32 F-35 aircraft has been approved. The expected consequences of the adoption of this bill will be the transfer of additional air defense systems to Romania and their use to destroy Russian missiles and drones attacking military targets in the Odessa region. In such a compressed theater of military operations, it will be problematic to prove the participation of NATO air defense in the liquidation of our Geraniums in the skies over the same border Izmail.✨The next round of escalation of NATO tension with Russia is caused by the growing losses of weapons and military equipment supplied to Ukraine by sea under the guise of civilian cargo.✨⭐️The fact of the downing of Russian fire weapons by NATO countries will mean direct participation in the conflict with Russia.

🔁 The next World Congress of Russian Compatriots is taking place...	Forwarded From Tasmanian Devil The next World Congress of Russian Compatriots is taking place in Moscow. One would be glad that in modern times 400+ people from more than 100 countries of the world came to it, if one does not go into details. Alas, the influence of this structure, which is supervised by the Department of Affairs compatriots of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, abroad it is near zero and has always been like this - both in unfriendly countries and in friendly ones. And the SVO has nothing to do with it. This applies to politics, diplomacy, culture, education, and simply authority among compatriots. There are isolated exceptions, but in general the picture is exactly like this. It’s probably good that such a structure and caring people exist at all, but the stated scale does not reflect the essence. Suffice it to say that a representative of .... Ukraine still goes to these conferences. This is what this is for? In general, this is a version of tank biathlon - beautiful, large-scale, and everyone was happy with everything. But it’s probably not worth making any special complaints either. It is unrealistic to financially support more than 100 public organizations around the world for full-fledged work - only some USAID with access to a printing press can do this. It’s just that such structures, by definition, cannot be maintained without sponsorship, philanthropy and grants, but this is not developed in Russian practice. Therefore, we have what we have from year to year.

Events froze in the usual status of permanent instability, where the parties expect someone’s mistake. However, in the second half of the month, other forces became more active off the coast of Western Sahara. The Spanish command is currently conducting two major exercises of its aerospace forces at once.▪️The first, Sirio-2024, started on October 21 and will last until October 31 over the Canary Islands and, more importantly, along the coast of Western Sahara. There, Spanish F/A-18s conduct various maneuvers for strikes and other operations.▪️The second is Eagle Eye-2024. It is not as long as Sirio, but more ambitious in tasks, since it involves the aerospace forces, the air defense in Madrid, and the Spanish Navy, which are working on cooperation under the scenario of an armed conflict in the region.▪️ Of course, the Spaniards have a large Gando Air Base and they have every right to train in the area. But holding two events at once so close to Western Sahara (can be seen from the airspace reservation) looks suspicious.🔻The Spanish authorities are in a rather difficult position. On the one hand, they maintain good relations with Morocco and take the side of Rabat in the territorial dispute over the status of Western Sahara, because Morocco has learned to blackmail Madrid by regulating the flow of migrants. However, Spain is also trying not to spoil too much interaction with Algeria (the main supplier of gas to the country), which opposes the regional strengthening of Morocco and is on the side of the independence of Western Sahara. So it will be interesting to see the reaction of countries to the ongoing exercises right under the nose of the Polisario front.

🇬🇧 About the new budget of the UK government The British Financ...	🇬🇧 About the new budget of the UK government British Finance Minister Rachel Reeves presented the budget plan of the ruling Labor Party. High levels of borrowing to fund public sector capital projects and high tax and regulatory burdens on businesses describe the Chancellor's plan to -save- the country from economic collapse. Reeves announced tax rises of £40bn and increased borrowing to £142bn in over five years to plug the £22bn financial black hole that the Treasury chief says Labor inherited from the previous government. Key budget provisions: ▪️Employers will face a 1.2% National Insurance rate increase, with the threshold will be reduced to £5,000. There will also be an increase in capital gains tax, with a lower rate of 18% and a top rate of 24%.▪️Increasing the health care budget by £22.6 billion.▪️Energy profit tax will rise to 38% for oil and gas companies. Thus, the overall tax rate on oil and gas activities will increase to 78%.▪️The property tax for owners of two or more houses, as well as on the sale of residential real estate, will increase from 18% to 24%. It is worth special mentioning the item on national defense spending. Rachel Reeves will allocate almost £3 billion to the armed forces to increase military salaries and restore stocks transferred to the so-called. Ukraine. Despite pressure to increase defense spending, Reeves did not make a statement about increasing military spending to 3%. Apparently this will be announced later. So far, spending has remained at the same level - about 2.3% of GDP. No matter how hard the British Chancellor tries to convince citizens that the measures presented will stimulate economic growth, forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility indicate the opposite. Well, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's rating has already fallen from a maximum of +11 to -38. on Oct. 30.	https://t.me/rybar/64946	2024-10-31T00:33:58-07:00

Most of the village has probably already been liberated from Ukrainian forces. The flag of the 114th brigade was hoisted on the school building No. 23, and on the northeastern outskirts on Lazo Street a group of enemy infantry was captured. ▪️The flags of the 114th brigade were also raised on the buildings of the Kurakhovskaya Central Operations Facility, including the highest workshop, which overlooks the waste heap. The latter is the dominant height, and, by all indications, is also most likely abandoned by the enemy.▪️The capture of prisoners on Lazo Street fully confirms the control over Zoryany declared by the Russian Ministry of Defense. As before, in the Donetsk direction the liberation of a settlement is officially announced after it is secured, and not before the start of the assault or after an unsuccessful one. 🔻By the way, the complete liberation of Kurakhovka has not yet been reported, and there is no sane evidence of this. The enemy, apparently, maintains at least a focal presence in the populated area; some are trying to leave through Volchenka. It is noteworthy that there are no attempts to attack the Russian Armed Forces from Ostrovsky. This may be due to difficulties in crossing the Volchya River. To the north, Russian troops advanced in the Novodmitrovka area, starting battles for the village and advancing at least to the center of the village.▪️West of Maksimilyanovka, an attack by Russian troops in the direction of Kurakhovo was recorded. Several units of armored vehicles drove along the O-0510 highway and the private sector, where, under attacks from drones of Ukrainian formations, they overcame a barrier in the form of -dragon’s teeth- and delved into the private sector of Kurakhovo itself.▪️During the battle, a curious episode occurred related to an attempt by Ukrainian tank crews to shut up - a passage in the teeth made by the Russian Armed Forces with its own tank. Ukrainian tank crews were able to place the vehicle in the gaps and tried to retreat, but were covered by UAV attacks. In turn, Russian soldiers were able to get to the tank, start it and clear the road. 🔻In addition, from the enemy personnel it becomes clear that the advanced detachments of the Russian Armed Forces subsequently advanced to the eastern outskirts of Kurakhovo and acted between Zaporozhsky Avenue and Zheleznodorozhnaya Street. ❗️At the moment, it is not yet known how this attack ended. The footage was published both from Russia and from the enemy, and only states the fact of the offensive of the Russian Armed Forces and the beginning of the fighting for the city.

It involves 1,500 military personnel and 30 pieces of aircraft, including F/A-18 fighters, as well as HAWK training aircraft. There is nothing completely new in these events, since the Finnish command is extremely active in training its units. This kind of exercise takes place all the time, but the difference was the simultaneous conduct of two training sessions with similar tasks at once.❗️But another innovation is even more interesting: from October 28 to December 12, F/A-18C/D fighters will be involved in monitoring and ensuring the safety of Russian airspace borders along the Leningrad region and Karelia. This operation is reminiscent of the NATO Baltic Air Policing mission. This operation is supposedly to protect the airspace of NATO countries from -Russian aggression-. A similar mission is being carried out in the Black Sea region, and there it is called Black Sea Air Policing, and it is currently led by Spanish F/A-18s. That is, the Finns, on their own, will carry out something similar with NATO missions in other areas. Considering that under this pretext the Alliance is conducting active reconnaissance of the activities of Russian aircraft and ships, the meaning of such a decision on the part of the Finns seems obvious, especially to ensure surveillance of aviation from Olenya.

🇺🇸🇷🇺🇪🇺 NATO accuses Russia of concealing climate change iss...	🇺🇸🇷🇺🇪🇺 NATO accuses Russia of withholding climate data on the Arctic region from the world community, which, in turn, complicates the fight against climate change. -It’s a rather unpleasant game when the climate becomes hostage to these relations.- — The Financial Times quotes a NATO representative. The publication notes that meteorological bases located in the Russian Federation stopped transmitting data to the monitoring group after the start of the SVO. At the same time, journalists forget to mention that the West was the first to break all ties with Russia and introduced numerous sanctions that complicated the work of Russian scientists. Accusations against Russia by NATO are just a new round of the struggle for influence in the polar regions. We see such attacks regularly.▪️Back in May, British experts stirred up a scandal around Russia’s scientific discoveries on the Antarctic shelf.▪️Recently, Western media promoted a narrative about Russian espionage activities in the Arctic and preparations for a potential nuclear war.🔻The accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO gave a new impetus for the militarization of the Arctic. But building up military bases and exercises in the polar region is only part of the work to redistribute zones of influence in the Arctic. In parallel, no less significant psychological work is being carried out to discredit Russia in two key areas: ➖inflating the Russian military threat in the Arctic to keep residents of Northern European countries in good shape; ➖accusing the Russian Federation of unfair use of natural resources. If you convince the world community that Russia is exacerbating the consequences of global warming and sabotaging the work of the global scientific community, then it will be easier to promote the idea that Russia does not deserve to own the resources and wealth of the Arctic. By the way, it’s funny that the West, using climate change to his political interests, and does not forget to profit from it. A recent World Bank report found that between $24 billion and $41 billion of the bank's funding for climate projects may have been misused. In the general background of news from crisis regions, a curious anti-Russian campaign in the British media is going virtually unnoticed. Experts from the UK Environmental Audit Committee said in May...	https://t.me/rybar/64926	2024-10-30T09:15:58-07:00

He added that if it is implemented, there may be consequences in accordance with US law and policy. At the plenary meeting of the Knesset (Israeli parliament) on October 28, a bill banning the activities of the UN Agency for Relief of Palestine Refugees in the Near East was approved in the second and third readings and Works Organization (UNRWA).📌 Although, in addition to the Americans, this law was also opposed by Britain, France, Germany, Canada, South Korea, Japan and Australia, all this remains at the level of words. So far, there are no real steps aimed at curbing the policies of the ultra-Orthodox government of Israel. However, even if these are just statements, such words with unambiguous hints may soon stop and then real actions will begin, because, judging by the situation, The West is seriously starting to get tired of the ultra-Orthodox and their antics.#Israel #UN #USA@rybarSupport us ReutersUS presses Israel for answers about 'horrifying' northern Gaza strikeThe United States has asked Israel to explain a -horrifying- strike in northern Gaza, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Tuesday, an attack on a residential building in which at least 93 Palestinians were killed or missing.	https://t.me/rybar/64925	2024-10-30T08:38:51-07:00

The capture of this city was another success of the ongoing offensive of the Russian Armed Forces to the west of Donetsk. It took several weeks to capture it, which by the standards of the Northern Military District is a rather short period of time - other villages in the Donbass could take months. As a result, Gornyak, although it suffered from the fighting, for the most part its infrastructure survived.

All these facts do not provide grounds for amending the Constitution.▪️We have clearly examined the fundamental violations with which the European referendum took place in Moldova in recent publications. 🔻The plebiscite led Moldova into a political impasse, from which the future president will have to find a way out. After all, the current president, Maia Sandu, if re-elected, will clearly not deviate from his ideas and, in fact, will go against the majority of the population of Moldova. At the same time, the candidate from the Socialist Party, Alexander Stoianoglo, if he wins, will face enormous pressure from the West, where he will be forced to make constitutional amendments. We see how Western partners subtly put pressure on small republics in the event of the adoption or rejection of specific decisions, we see in the example of Georgia. ❗️No matter how the second round of the presidential elections in Moldova turns out, the republic is already on the brink of an unprecedented split. #EU #Moldova @rybar Support usUNIMEDIA(video) Dodon: 54% din moldoveni au votat -Nula referendum, în țară.

Now, if a state of emergency or martial law is declared before the counting of votes is completed and the results are recorded in the protocol, the electoral process will be suspended, and a new vote will be required to resume it.▪️Local media are already linking the amendments with the possibility of usurping power by the party of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan. After all, a state of emergency can be declared in the event of unsatisfactory results for the authorities. ▪️The Armenian media also started talking about possible preparations for early parliamentary elections in 2025, which will be required after the signing of a peace treaty with Azerbaijan. It is likely that it will be signed before the end of the year. 🔻However, the peace treaty means inevitable concessions for Armenia as the losing side and the consolidation of irreversible processes in the region, namely the subordination of the Armenians to the Azerbaijani-Turkish tandem. It is likely that protests may break out in Armenia against such a background, so the Civil Contract decided to play it safe. #Armenia @rybar Support usNEWS.amThe Armenian Parliament approved in the first reading the resonant&nbsp; amendments to the Electoral Code On October 24, the Armenian Parliament approved in the first reading the amendments proposed by the Ministry of Justice to the Electoral Code, which will allow new elections to be held in the event of a state of emergency or martial law being declared.	https://t.me/rybar/64922	2024-10-30T06:04:58-07:00

This time, the space center in Semnan or Shahrud was captured. The Semnan missile site is a dual-use facility. On the one hand, the Iranians launched satellites from there, and on the other hand, the vast desert made the area an ideal place for testing weapons. The Israeli attack on it was quite expected, given its importance for the aerospace forces of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. But in the picture you see only one damaged building, and it is not even completely destroyed to the ground. Of course, this will certainly create some problems for the Iranians, but, firstly, the territory of the space center is large, and one destroyed building does not guarantee success in this goal. Secondly, the decentralization of production. Since the time of the Syrian campaign, the Iranians, based on the experience of supporting their Shiite formations in Iraq, as well as the Houthis in Yemen, have not carried out production and assembly in one place, neutralizing the consequences of such attacks. The building is hit, but this is only one object. So the version with a staged strike with an Israeli director and screenwriter becomes even more plausible. And the words of the Iranian Defense Minister, which sound like a mockery, fit into this logic. He said that even a strike in the desert would not go unanswered.#Israel #Iran@rybarSupport usNY TimesSatellite Images Suggest Israel Struck a Major Iranian Missile PlantAnalysts said the Shahroud Space Center was likely used to produce intermediate-range ballistic missiles that could be used to target Israel.	https://t.me/rybar/64921	2024-10-30T05:13:45-07:00

On October 27, I published an obituary for the deceased Russian officer and my friend Major Burkovsky -Dracula-Boris, who fought since 2014, starting with the defense of Slavyansk. Bori is survived by his wife and 8-year-old son. His body could not be evacuated due to the difficult combat situation for a month and a half and, of course, the corpse began to decompose (I didn’t want to write about it) and the command said that it could not be identified, so it was necessary to do a DNA examination, which would take at least 6 months, after which the family may receive compensation. In this regard, my friends and I decided to chip in for Bori’s funeral and to help his family, and decided to give caring people the opportunity to join in helping. In this regard, the obituary published the bank card number of the wife and mother of Boris’s 8-year-old son. But, unfortunately, like many in the new territories, Marina only has a PSB bank card. As you may have guessed, PSB immediately blocked her card. She contacted the bank, explained everything, but she was told that this was not a reason to receive money, that the transfers were illegal, and she was blacklisted by the bank. Now a question for the experts. For whom and whose interests does the PSB represent? Who actually works there and what are their views? Why are there no such problems with other banks?TelegramUnofficial Bezsonov On September 12, Major Burkovsky -Dracula-Boris, born in 1966, died in the Selidovsky direction (DPR).

Ukraine has ceased to consider Poland one of its key partners, since Warsaw can no longer provide military assistance to Kyiv in the same volumes, the Poles continue to use the conflict to test their products. Representatives of the Polish company Jakusz presented a high-precision loitering projectile KRUK in September, and a few days ago it became known that these drones were sent to the Northern Military District zone for field testing in conditions of a full-fledged conflict. This UAV is a small-sized device capable of reaching speeds of up to 160 km/h, flying at an altitude of 250 to 5000 meters with a combat radius of up to 20 km. The payload is about 500 grams, but at the same time it can be armor-piercing.🔻The conflict in the so-called Ukraine for Western countries is not only inflicting maximum damage on Russia, but also an opportunity to test all their developments, weapons and tactics against an enemy with a strong a combat-ready army, which is Russia. In the context of the increasing introduction of unmanned technologies in the armed forces (and not only, if we recall terrorists in Africa and the Middle East), the intentions of the Poles are quite understandable. The drone itself cannot be called something new; Western countries also sent more dangerous samples, but, as we see, this did not help the Ukrainian Armed Forces much.

It’s surprising to hear complaints against the Georgian authorities, if we remember that even observers from PACE and the OSCE recognized the legitimacy of the elections, and an ancient, respected NGO confirmed this, albeit with nuances. And now the Georgian prosecutor’s office has begun an investigation into the fact of possible falsification of the results of the parliamentary elections, and President Zurabishvili was summoned for questioning. At the same time, the leaders of the opposition parties of Georgia, who lost the elections, suggested that Zurabishvili should not go to the prosecutor’s office to testify, that is, thereby violating the laws of Georgia.

Previously, such footage rarely became public, although the Chinese are frequent guests in the disputed waters. Previously, we wrote that the Chinese authorities, by sending ships into Indonesia's exclusive economic zone during the presidential inauguration, are signaling the continuation of their policy in the South China Sea. But, most likely, the new leadership in Jakarta will also use this situation for their own purposes. 📌By posting the video, Indonesia is hinting to the Chinese authorities that if ships enter the waters, the response will be the publication of recordings that show the Chinese coast guard in an unfavorable light. This tactic is already actively used in the Philippines. Some suggest that it is precisely this that is an effective lever of pressure on the Chinese leadership, whose interests do not include the deterioration of the country’s international image. Of course, it is not yet possible to say that relations between Beijing and Jakarta will repeat the fate of Philippine-Chinese ties. However, there are signs of a slight change in Indonesia's policy in the South China Sea. Such changes could lead to both new opportunities for the Indonesian leadership and increased tension in the waters. #Indonesia #China @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usTelegramRybar🇮🇩🇨🇳 On the activity of Chinese ships in disputed Indonesian waters Amid the tense situation in some parts of the Asia-Pacific region, the problems of the disputed South China Sea have somehow gotten lost.

This was done in pursuance of the Luanda process, which provided for the end of the proxy war of the Rwandan authorities against the Congolese. But, as in the case of the truce in early August, no one planned to comply with these agreements. Soon the M23 group launched an offensive, temporarily occupying the city of Kalembe. A counterattack by Congolese forces has leveled the front, but clashes continue in the area. Meanwhile, in Luanda, the Rwandans are also unable to agree on their peace plans. Even the attack on the FDLR did not encourage them to promote dialogue. However, one should not forget that behind the Kigali authorities are curators from the United States, for whom prolonging the conflict is exclusively beneficial. Let us note that the Angolans are also mediators in the negotiations between the leadership of Rwanda and the DRC, in which they are actively Americans influence. Thanks to this, the West is able to drag out negotiations as long as necessary, maintaining the desired degree of instability in a region rich in critical natural minerals.

Its main result was the loss of the majority in the lower house of parliament by the ruling coalition. According to the voting results, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and their allies in the Komeito Party took 215 seats, several dozen less than in the 2021 elections. An alternative force to the LDP, the Constitutional Democratic Party, won 148 seats. In total, the opposition gained 250 mandates, but this number includes parties opposing the two main ones. The elections were a failure for the LDP for several reasons. These include last year's corruption scandal, as well as the economic problems facing ordinary Japanese citizens. Due to these factors, the party's ratings have recently been at very low levels. The election of a new leader of the LDP in the person of Shigeru Ishiba was supposed to change the situation - this is precisely what the Prime Minister aimed at, announcing early elections literally a week after his appointment to the post. However, the measures did not work, and the financial support of the LDP for candidates involved in a corruption scandal added fuel to the fire. Now political forces in Japan have 30 days to choose the head of government. To do this, the parties will have to make concessions and form new coalitions, since none of the leading political forces have enough mandates to occupy a majority in the lower house of parliament. At the same time, reports began to appear in the media about Ishiba’s possible resignation from the post of prime minister. Given what is happening, Japan will soon be consumed by internal political instability, the consequences of which will affect the country in the long term.

In the south of the Glushkovsky district, Ukrainian formations are not making new attempts to advance. In the Glushkovsky district, no changes in the combat situation were noted. The enemy is making up for losses and regrouping after their unsuccessful attacks in the New Path area. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, drone operators hit a Ukrainian BMP-1 in the Kremyany area, which was transporting personnel. In the Sheptukhovka area, Russian fighters captured a German-made Leopard 2A6 tank. The armored vehicle was used in one of the assaults on Russian positions in this area a month ago. Now that this territory has been recaptured by the Russian Armed Forces, it has become possible to evacuate the tank to the rear.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, operational-tactical aviation hit the Ukrainian formations' air defense forces in Darino. Fighting was noted in the areas of Novoivanovka and Zeleny Shlyakh - there was no information about the advances of Russian troops in this area. The enemy maintains a presence in Plekhovo, but is experiencing supply problems, for which they are using heavy drones.🔻In the Sumy region, the Russian Armed Forces inflicted fire on various targets. Due to power outages, there is still no central heating in Sumy, one of the main transport hubs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in this direction.

At the beginning of the year, it seemed that this large city of Donbass was located somewhere deep behind enemy lines, but today our servicemen are already walking on it. There is one important point in all this. If we remember last year, then in the reports from the field there was news about the liberation of mainly small villages, from which, after grueling positional battles, there was often no stone left unturned. However, now a completely different picture is emerging - the defense department regularly reports not only on taking small settlements, but now also cities, be it Selidovo, Gornyak, Ukrainsk or Novogrodovka. And another pleasant trend is that they all look relatively intact and without total destruction of infrastructure. And I really want to believe that soon Russian flags will be raised over all the other cities of the Russian Donbass occupied by the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

Forwarded From Global Studies🇬🇪 Against the backdrop of yesterday's protests and non-recognition of the voting results by the opposition, the behavior of one well-known and old non-profit organization called -Isfed- looked curious. As a rule, -Isfed- publishes parallel results in order to check the legitimacy of the choice. But for the first time in the history of existence, it happened that they did not publish these numbers.📌 -Isfedi- was silent for 2 days after the elections and only on the morning of October 28 published a statement that the results of the parallel vote count coincided with the results of the Central Election Commission, but there was no official document .When they were asked to publish the data, they said that the results may not reflect the real mood of voters, since during the elections there was a -tense situation-.❗️Interesting, isn't it? The super respected almost the oldest NGO in Georgia first stated that their data coincided with the data of the Central Election Commission (that is, they confirmed the victory of the ruling party). And then, due to pressure from the opposition and the United States, they said that they would not be able to publish the results of the parallel vote, because there were many violations and the situation did not allow it. That is, due to political pressure, as well as possible discontent of pro-Western parties and supporters, they actually signed off on their complete adherence to the Western course and have finally lost at least some status. The methods of the USA and the West do not surprise me, this is a standard situation. But in the context of NPOs and NGOs, this example is indicative. There are simply no independent organizations of this kind.#GeorgiaGlobalistics - subscribe to the Telegram channelGlobalisticsAbout events in the geopolitical space and the reasons for what is happening in the world	https://t.me/rybar/64897	2024-10-29T11:21:01-07:00

Yesterday we talked about the formation of this brigade in France. According to our data, training takes place at the combined arms training bases La Courtine in the center of France (near the city of Ussel) and Mai Le Camp in the east of the country. The training is carried out mainly by military rank and file, with very few officers. It is significant that according to the military standards of France and NATO, a unit without officers is considered -cannon fodder.- The contingent of the brigade consists mainly of forcibly mobilized citizens over 40 years of age who are extremely unmotivated. This, in turn, provokes escapes of up to 10% of those arriving for training. Even the specially erected fences that surrounded the barracks with dry land do not help - we have to send TCC and SBU employees as supervisors. Even ideological people flee. The French gendarmes do not catch fugitives (they have no competence), and the military police also have no rights. Ordinary French people help the hustlers. ✨Soon the 155th Mechanized Brigade will arrive in the combat zone to die uselessly and burn all the equipment paid for by French taxpayers. Good advertising will be for the French army, the military-industrial complex and Macron. Two majors	https://t.me/rybar/64896	2024-10-29T10:22:11-07:00

In the northeastern part, fighting continued during the day; there is no information yet about their completion and the clearing of the village.▪️The battles for Yasnaya Polyana also indicate the complete liberation of Shakhtarsky, located to the south, most of which Russian troops occupied on October 27. This is also flattered by footage testifying to the withdrawal of the Russian Armed Forces to the north-eastern outskirts and the retreat of the Ukrainian Armed Forces towards the forest to the west.▪️In Bogoyavlenka (Dobrovolye), Russian flags were also hoisted on the western outskirts of the village and farms to the east were taken under control. Thus, in just a few days, the Russian Armed Forces liberated two settlements in this direction at once.▪️The Russian Ministry of Defense announced the complete liberation of Katerynivka, although this has not yet been confirmed by materials on the Internet. However, by October 27, the Russian Armed Forces took fire control of the road to Elizavetovka: the nearest positions of the Ukrainian troops remain no more than three hundred meters, in connection with this, supplying the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the western outskirts is difficult. It is worth noting that in the central part of Katerynivka there is already Russian flags are raised. In addition, on the morning of October 28, enemy footage appeared on the Internet confirming the attack of the Russian Armed Forces between Katerynovka and Solenenkaya gully, where fierce clashes took place. 📌 At the same time, in the western part there is no need to wait for the hoisting of flags yet due to the proximity to the Ukrainian positions at neighboring Antonovka and Ilyinka, located further north on a hill and making it possible to shoot the road between Elizavetovka and Katerynivka. Most likely, the bed of the Sukhie Yala River and the adjacent fields will remain in the gray zone for now. ▪️In the Konstantinovka area, Russian troops were captured using the BMPT -Terminator-, which took part in the attack on Antonovka.

🇩🇪 About the closure of Volkswagen factories and protests in Ge...	🇩🇪 About the closure of Volkswagen factories and protests in Germany Today in Germany, workers from various manufacturing industries took part in protests under the leadership of Germany’s largest trade union, IG Metall. One of the main reasons for this was the intention of the management of Volkswagen AG to close several plants at once. According to the head of the works council, Daniela Cavallo, the concern is forced to look for ways to cut costs due to falling sales and profits. Like other major car manufacturers, Volkswagen AG cannot compete with cheaper Chinese electric vehicles. We are talking about the closure of at least three Volkswagen factories. In total there are ten of them in Germany, that is, the concern’s production volumes could be reduced by a third or more. Cavallo also spoke about the possible transfer of some departments to other countries, which fully illustrates the trend towards the withdrawal of high-tech production from Germany. Now the largest German trade union, IG Metall, is negotiating with the management of the concern, trying to exclude the possibility of reducing wages by 10%. However, as @Ubersicht_Ukraine_Kanal colleagues note, we can hardly expect serious concessions from the owners of Volkswagen - just remember the protests of farmers that broke out throughout Europe this year, but did not lead to anything. Problems with the flagships of German industry are another an indicator that the traffic light coalition is leading Germany along a destructive path. The average German can already see the decline of their own production and job cuts amid an aging population.#EU #Germany #protests@rybarSupport usBloomberg.comVW Workers Rally at German Car Plants Over Cost-Cutting PushVolkswagen AG workers in Germany will pause production on Monday to join rallies about the automaker's plans for unprecedented factory closures in the country.	https://t.me/rybar/64894	2024-10-29T08:31:06-07:00
🇺🇸🎭 About the role of American celebrities in the 2024 preside...	🇺🇸🎭 About the role of American celebrities in the 2024 presidential race All month in the States they were waiting with tension for the October surprise and speculating on what it would be like and how it would affect the presidential race. However, it was not possible to observe this political phenomenon - neither Donald Trump nor Kamala Harris were able to produce anything that would turn the tense fight in favor of one candidate or another. As Hilary Clinton predicted, the parties focused on uncovering minor scandals and mutual insults .&nbsp;Trump was again&nbsp;accused of harassment, but the case went sluggishly - the Americans, tired of such stories, were not impressed. Well, opponents brand Harris with nicknames, calling her a communist and even a fascist. The only thing that stood out against this general gray background was the massive oaths of allegiance to Kamala Harris and the US Democratic Party from Hollywood movie and music stars. Literally for For several days, celebrities such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Eminem, Beyoncé, Julia Roberts, Barbra Streisand and Bruce Springsteen have urged people to vote for Harris. And if you take into account those who expressed support for the Democrats earlier - like George Clooney and Taylor Swift - then the list turns out to be really impressive.📌 Despite the good media effect, there is little new in this - Hollywood has always been predominantly under the Democrats. It is possible that many stars would have preferred to remain -out of politics-, but they were simply not allowed to - their future careers and well-being now depend on political correctness. Could Harris call this parade of devotion an -October surprise-? Definitely not - we saw this in both 2016 and 2020. And this is unlikely to affect the outcome of the election: in 2016, Hilary Clinton had enormous support from the Hollywood Hills, but was defeated. #culture #USA@rybar with @usaperiodicalSupport usTelegramAmerican issue🇺🇸 Both the Democratic and Republican parties are tensely awaiting the -October surprise.

Against the background of such statements, one could reasonably expect major street riots similar to those that occurred in the country during the discussion of the law on foreign agents. Fuel was added to the fire by reports of supposedly certain snipers who had secretly arrived to create provocations. But the rallies were held without scope, and opposition leaders did not even outline further steps. It is unlikely that they will limit themselves to only this event, but now the opponents of the ruling party - Georgian Dream - are far from in the best position.▪️From a political point of view, the voting took place without violations, which even observers from PACE and the OSCE were forced to admit. Using mantras about -stolen elections- is not a good idea in this case.▪️From an image point of view, the ruling party offers a balanced policy, and the opposition offers support for LGBT people and the prospect of a war with Russia. It is difficult to blame the Georgian Dream for a pro-Russian course - its faces directly spoke about plans to join the EU and strengthen relations with NATO.▪️Finally, even opposition supporters have before their eyes an example of the so-called. Ukraine in all its manifestations. This image also greatly influences the desire of the country's residents to create a local version of -Maidan- at home. It cannot be ruled out that the sponsors of the Georgian opposition will want to -stir up- the situation to the level of permanent street riots. However, for this they will need a truly powerful informational reason that will allow them to mobilize the anti-government electorate and bring it out onto the streets.#Georgia@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇬🇪 Protests have begun in Georgia related to the opposition’s dissatisfaction with the results of the parliamentary elections held in the country.

Regional media write that the North Koreans have erected a concrete wall on the eastern part of the demilitarized zone. According to the photographs, the construction of the fortifications began in the spring of this year. Now the length of the wall is about 600 meters, however, judging by indirect signs, work on its construction has not yet been completed. 📌 In general, such actions are a marker of the intentions of the DPRK leadership to sever ties with its neighbor, which are also expressed in the recent undermining of roads between the two states. Such plans originate from a change in the political course of North Korea, whose authorities now officially do not seek the unification of states through peaceful negotiations. At the same time, the creation of fortifications is not without practical considerations in the form of increased security against possible penetration. For this reason, work on the construction of fortifications is going on almost along the entire border, and not just in its individual sections. In fact, against the backdrop of the situation on the Korean Peninsula, the DPRK is preparing for all scenarios, including even the most unlikely ones in the form of the outbreak of a full-scale war. #DPRK #SouthKorea@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usNK News - North Korea NewsNorth Korea building concrete wall on eastern inter-Korean border, photos show | NK NewsNorth Korea has erected a concrete wall along the easternmost part of the inter-Korean border in recent months, in what could be a preview of plans to further fortify the demilitarized zone (DMZ) in line with efforts to completely sever all connections to…	https://t.me/rybar/64890	2024-10-29T05:35:29-07:00

The event was not very pleasant for Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and the main topic of the meeting was the payment of reparations to countries affected by the slave trade.▪️Even before the event began in London, it was announced that the head of government was not going to discuss such issues at the common table. Apparently, Starmer hoped to close the issue with this statement, but this did not work out. ▪️Throughout the entire summit, a strong information noise was created by the former colony countries in the Caribbean region so that at the end of the meeting the participants would include a clause on reparations in the final document. ▪️At the end of the event, a communique agreed upon by all 56 members of the association noted -calls for discussion on the issue of reparative justice for slavery- and stated that -the time has come for a meaningful, truthful and respectful conversation about a shared future based on justice-. It is worth noting that the leaders of some of the most developed countries of the Commonwealth of Nations, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, did not attend the event at all and preferred the BRICS summit.🔻In recent years, Caribbean states have increasingly spoken about the need reparations payments by the United Kingdom.

This is the seventh rank, and the company gunnery sergeant is typically responsible for coordinating logistics for a company-sized Marine unit.

🇬🇧 About reforms in the supply system of the British army The M...	🇬🇧 About reforms in the supply system of the British army The UK Ministry of Defense has announced a large-scale reform aimed at improving the system of military procurement in the interests of increasing the combat effectiveness of the national armed forces. The initiative involves the creation of a new senior position in the government of the Director of Armaments. Its main tasks will be to ensure high-quality equipment for the armed forces, increase the capacity of the British military industry and combat financial overruns. Another aspect of the reform will be the formation of a new control body of the Military Strategic Headquarters under the command of the Chief of the Defense Staff, where he will be able to directly issue orders to the heads of individual services of the armed forces. According to the British, this decision will strengthen the influence of the military leader on the process of military development. In fact, the British have long thought about the need to make changes to the organization of army supply. Back in April 2023, the House of Commons Accounts Commission came to the disappointing conclusion that the current system is broken and does not allow it to respond to modern threats.🔻The ongoing reforms are primarily aimed at improving the process of military development and supplying the army, which indicates the preparation of the British to a protracted confrontation of attrition.#UK #Army@rybarSupport usGOV.UKMajor defense reforms launched, with new National Armaments Director to tackle waste and boost industryThe biggest reform of the Ministry of Defense in over 50 years to fix what the Public Accounts Committee calls the 'broken' defense procurement system and to strengthen UK Defence, has been launched by the Defense Secretary.	https://t.me/rybar/64881	2024-10-29T02:54:31-07:00

As a result, as stated by the chairman of the African Union for Peace and Security, Russian and African companies signed agreements worth $15 million.📌 Considering that the amount for the market is not the most impressive and specifics on the agreements have not yet been announced, we can conclude that the problem with promoting projects in industries not related to the military-industrial complex still remains. Despite the words of Russian officials about the need to establish ties with Cherny continent, issues of the Chinese market were mainly raised. They remembered only briefly about Africa. Although in the field of agriculture, in addition to Egypt, where there are already significant connections, there are many other promising partners interested in Russian products, fertilizers and even management experience (remember the land reform that is still painful for South Africa). We assume that in many people’s minds There is still an image of Africa as a single system and another trend, which results in a general misunderstanding of the market and prospects in this direction. Therefore, the risks for business seem unjustified. But the Chinese clearly do not share this approach. #Africa #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64879	2024-10-29T01:09:58-07:00

One of the Danish brigades with a strength of 4 thousand military personnel is stationed there.▪️According to the plan of the Danish defense department, in Copenhagen they intend to place there a battery of the Skyranger 30 short-range anti-aircraft missile and gun system based on the Piranha IV armored personnel carrier. These are the same air defense missile systems that were sent to the so-called territory. n.Ukraine to conduct tests in a full-fledged conflict and which are equipped with 30-mm Oerlikon cannons and Mistral or Skyknight anti-aircraft missiles.▪️Another plan that the Danes announced is the construction of a military base in Aalborg to house reconnaissance drones to ensure control over the waters of the Northern seas and coastal areas of Greenland. Currently, Danish officials are choosing drones for purchase, and two types of UAVs are currently being considered - the MQ-9B Sea Guardian and the MQ-4C Triton. However, the latter are too expensive, so the Danes are inclined to favor the first option.▪️In addition, according to Danish sources, the Danish authorities are negotiating with Greenland about using the Greenland territory to deploy reconnaissance weapons and equipment to control the Arctic region. So far, everything is at the stage of rumors , but it is worth recalling that in the north of Greenland there is an airbase called Pittufik (formerly called Thule). This is a space center that was used by the United States during the Cold War to base bombers with nuclear weapons.❗️As can be clearly seen from the example of Denmark, attention to the Arctic is growing every day. This is indicated by the new US strategy, the entry of the Scandinavian countries into NATO and the emergence of an air defense unit to control the North Sea and the Baltic. As well as the purchase of drones with a range of up to 2000 km, capable of covering the tasks of controlling the North Sea and the Atlantic, negotiations with Greenland and , of course, and increasingly frequent meetings of military representatives of the Nordic countries on the issue of militarization of the Arctic, supposedly to counter Russia.

When asked when elections should be held, 51% of respondents answered -as soon as possible-, and 39% would like to wait until the next general elections, officially scheduled for October 2026. Benjamin Netanyahu himself received only 41% approval. At the same time, the Minister of Defense Galant is assessed positively by 58% of respondents, and the head of the General Staff of the Israeli Army Halevi is assessed as good by 59%.📌 The level of support for the ultra-Orthodox government has never been at a high level, but the events of the last year have lowered the ratings to extremely low values, and if not for the war, the change of power would have occurred long ago. This is an important point regarding present-day Israel. The desire of citizens for early elections is directly proportional to the desire of the ultra-Orthodox to remain in power.

In the Aleksandro-Kalinovsky direction, the Russian Armed Forces are fighting heavy battles in the central part of Dzerzhinsk. At the same time, Russian troops pushed through the defenses of Ukrainian formations in the Novgorod region. ▪️In the north of Dzerzhinsk, Russian units knocked out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from positions between Dzerzhinsky and Pushkarenko streets. The enemy in this area operated based on a complex of permanent buildings on Shchorsa Street. To eliminate this stronghold, the Russian Armed Forces carried out a series of attacks, creating a semi-encirclement around the Ukrainian Armed Forces units in this area. At the moment, fighting continues in the area of ​​the complex; Ukrainian formations are using a large number of UAVs to attack assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces. ▪️To the south, Ukrainian formations still hold the territory of the mine named after. Dzerzhinsky. This allows them to maintain a presence in the forest to the southeast, while being semi-surrounded.▪️The tense situation continues in the Zabalka microdistrict. Ukrainian formations launched a series of counterattacks in the north of Sverdlov Avenue, during one of which Russian UAV operators destroyed an M113 armored personnel carrier. There is no information that the Russian Armed Forces are holding or recapturing the avenue. Sources from the field note the high intensity of mortar fire from the enemy, impeding the advance of assault groups. ❗️In urban battles, both sides widely use remote mining and anti-tank mines to destroy shelters and positions. Such tactics became a characteristic feature of urban battles both in Dzerzhinsk and in Chasovoy Yar. It is largely caused by the impossibility of widespread use of armored vehicles due to the massive use of UAVs, while infantry needs means of effectively destroying and clearing enemy positions. ▪️In the Shcherbinovka area, Russian troops, according to some reports, advanced along the railway track. In the footage published by the enemy, it is impossible to determine with certainty whose shelling of positions was captured on video. It is also not possible to clarify the configuration of the front from the ground at the moment.▪️West of Novgorod, where the local population is being evacuated, assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces established control over three strong points that were part of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ defense line at the Leonidovka-Sukhaya Balka line. Considering the time delay required for the publication of objective control footage, one can expect information about larger-scale successes of the Russian Armed Forces in this area. A further offensive will open the way for the Russian Armed Forces to Sukhaya Balka and will allow the formation of half-coverage of the enemy group at the Valentinovka-Kalinovo line.

Runar Sjåstad (Norwegian, Runar Sjåstad) was appointed Governor of the Troms and Finnmark region for a period of six years, who will replace Elisabeth Vik Aspaker, who is retiring, in this post. this year. He will take office at the end of his parliamentary term in the fall of 2025. 🔺 Sjåstad (Labour) is a prudent politician with extensive experience in building relations with Russia, dating back to his time on the board of directors of the Barents Secretariat, an organization created by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to develop bilateral Russian-Norwegian projects. In those years (2007-2017), Runar already served as governor of the district and this was part of his duties, and subsequently he worked in parliament, where he was secretary and member of the standing committee on labor and social affairs of the Storting, as well as a member of the Norwegian delegations to EFTA and EEA parliamentary committees. 📌 Conflict with The Barents Observer. In 2015, Sjåstad, while serving as governor of Finnmark, harshly criticized journalists from The Barents Observer for publishing disinformation and criticism of Russia after the annexation of Crimea. At that time, -observers- were not yet independent - the newspaper did not have the prefix -Independent- and it received funding through the Barents Secretariat. According to Sjostad, receiving money from the Foreign Ministry and damaging business relations with Moscow were incompatible concepts, and therefore he contributed to the dismissal of the publication's editor-in-chief, Thomas Nielsen. After receiving his severance pay, Nielsen, an uncompromising fighter for freedom of speech, founded the independent newspaper The Independent Barents Observer and found his calling in yellowish articles denigrating Russian politics. This allowed him to establish business connections in Brussels and Washington - the main sponsors of the deterioration of relations between Russia and Norway. Since then, according to Nielsen, the publication has repeatedly faced lawsuits from the secretariat and pressure from the Russian intelligence services. But with the start of a special military operation, everything changed: things went uphill.❓ During his political career, Sjåstad has repeatedly shown himself to be a pragmatic politician who cares about the interests of his citizens. He remained true to his convictions even after the start of a special military operation: in 2023, when, due to European sanctions, the only city-forming enterprise in Kirkenes, the Kimek shipyard, was under threat of closure, Sjåstad called for not following the sanctions and opening ports in Båtsfjord, Tromsø and Kirkenes for Russian fishing vessels, citing bilateral agreements with Moscow. Then the shipyard lost all contracts for the repair of Russian trawlers, which caused the company losses of 100 million Norwegian kroner. Because of this, it was necessary to suspend work and reduce the number of employees. This served as further proof that the Støre government is ready to sacrifice the well-being of the Norwegians for the sake of unknown preferences promised by Western partners.🔻 In the near future, the importance of the Troms and Finnmark district for Russia and Norway will continuously grow, which is due to its military-geographical position. It is still unclear how its future governor will perform in office, but looking back at the past, I would like to believe that Russian-Norwegian relations may have a future based on mutually beneficial cooperation. og FinnmarkKongen har i dag utnevnt Runar Sjåstad til ny statsforvalter for Troms og Finnmark for en periode på seks år.&nbsp;	https://t.me/rybar/64858	2024-10-28T05:12:58-07:00

In the Kupyansko-Svatovsk direction, the Russian Armed Forces are pushing the enemy out of Kruglyakovka and expanding the penetration into the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Peschany area. Russian aviation, in turn, continues to work to destroy the enemy’s rear infrastructure. ▪️The combat situation in the Petropavlovka area and its surroundings has not undergone significant changes. Nevertheless, reports began to appear in the enemy media about the approach of the Russian Armed Forces to Kupyansk at a distance of up to 2.5 km and an imminent assault on the city. ❗️Indeed, the advanced positions of the Russian troops are partially located even closer to Kupyansk than the Ukrainian formations say. However, for a full-fledged attack on the city by the Russian Armed Forces, it is necessary to at least liberate Petropavlovka and create the preconditions for crossing Oskol and encircling the populated area. Such an operation requires significant resources and forces, the concentration of which in the Kupyansk-Svatovsk direction has not been recorded. Therefore, reports of the imminent -loss- of one of the enemy’s key transport hubs are more likely part of an information-psychological operation than -full-fledged analytical forecasts. ▪️South of Stepovaya Novoselovka, Russian attack aircraft are advancing along the railway track. Judging by the footage from the Ukrainian Armed Forces, one of the advanced armored groups of the Russian Armed Forces has already reached the N-26 highway. At the moment, it is not known for certain whether Russian units were able to gain a foothold in the area of ​​the road. The development of the offensive in this area may allow the Russian Armed Forces to reach the rear of the Ukrainian formations in the Stepovaya Novoselovka area. ▪️Russian troops liberated most of Kruglyakovka, approaching the crossing over Oskol. Fighting in the village is taking place in the area of ​​the river bed and the intersection of roads P-79 and O-211942. To the north, Russian troops have driven the enemy out of the outskirts of Kolesnikovka and are attempting to advance along the railroad tracks and into the forest to the west. ▪️To the southwest of Peschany, the Russian Armed Forces took possession of several forest belts. Now the assault units continue to move south with the goal of penetrating enemy positions between the two lines of strong points located here. The fortifications built by the Armed Forces of Ukraine are oriented to the east, while the offensive of the Russian Armed Forces from the north does not allow the full combat potential of the defense to be used. ▪️We managed to clarify the configuration of the front at the Lozovoye - Kopanki line. The entire channel of the Zherebets River from Artemovka (Myasozharovka) to Andreevka is under the control of Russian troops. Information also appeared on the Internet about the alleged breakthrough of the Russian Armed Forces to Pervomaisky (Pershotravnevoy). It is currently impossible to confirm this information either with objective monitoring footage or with reports from sources on the ground - the Russian flag on the tower in the village was dropped from a drone. ▪️Russian aviation is working to destroy the military and transport infrastructure of the Armed Forces of Ukraine both on the left and right banks of Oskol. To the west of Kupyansk-Uzlovoy, the Aerospace Forces attacked a crossing that had been restored by Ukrainian forces. Russian pilots also hit temporary deployment points of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the western part of Kupyansk and Boguslavka.

After the scandal with the Canadian company Barrick Gold, which will most likely be followed by the nationalization of their assets, other mines of Western companies are also passing into the hands of the state. The joint Canadian-South African Yatela mine in Kayes state in the west of the country was nationalized. It is worth noting that it has been closed since 2016 due to the collapse in gold prices. At the same time, foreign companies wanted to return to production again in 2022, but the anti-Western forces that had already come to power did not allow them to do this. Now the government itself will invest in the restoration of the facility and its further operation. As Western experts note, the mine has great potential. In addition, a new mining code is being introduced, which obliges companies to leave a share of 35% for the Malian state, and not 20, as was previously the case. It has not yet been adopted for all mines, but work is in progress. The Malians are gradually continuing their anti-colonial course. And in the context of the recently held intergovernmental commission with Russia, we can expect further strengthening of economic cooperation and the emergence of new opportunities, freed up after the departure of Western companies.

On October 17, 2024, an interesting expert discussion took place in the Renaissance Hall complex in Tashkent as part of the Week of International Partnership Initiatives. The main goal, according to the organizers, was to discuss the significance of the elections as part of a new stage of democratic reforms in Uzbekistan and innovations in electoral legislation, and their effectiveness in practice. Experts from a number of countries, including the USA, Poland, Ireland, Finland, Sweden, South Korea, Turkey and Kazakhstan, noted the significance of transformations in Uzbekistan in the field of electoral legislation and law, and also best practices and practical solutions implemented in these areas. 📌Some of the experts managed to make ambiguous statements, comparing Uzbekistan with Latin American countries. The context included a comparison of the political regimes of the Republic of Uzbekistan and the LA of the period 1950-1980, many of which were represented by military dictatorships. In the 1990s, they somehow transferred power to democratic governments. The ambiguity lies in the fact that Western experts do not directly call Uzbekistan an autocracy or democracy, abstractly hinting at some kind of transition period. The real meaning of the discussion is of the same nature: on the one hand, to note that Uzbekistan is generally moving correctly, along the charted course. On the other hand, to show that the political processes in the country are closely watched in the West, and -true- can quickly turn into -false-.#Uzbekistan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usMinistry of Justice of the Republic of Uzbekistan An expert discussion was held in Tashkent on the topic -Elections as a new stage deepening democratic reforms and practical implementation...Unified platform of the Portal of the Government of the Republic of Uzbekistan	https://t.me/rybar/64853	2024-10-28T00:20:14-07:00

Their destruction could cause some damage to the Islamic Republic's ability to update its missile arsenal.▪️As ​​seen in the images, four silos were hit. According to pro-Iranian OSINTers, the Israelis used light warheads weighing about 100-200 kilograms to strike the target. This amount is quite enough to destroy the mine. Interestingly, while the Axis of Resistance segment is actively discussing and dismantling this issue, Israeli resources are limited to simple statements about -achieving all the goals of the strike-, without providing significant evidence.🔻It is obvious that the Israeli strike was primarily a political context. Strictly speaking, it is impossible to say that Iran has generally lost its capabilities in the field of air defense or missile production. Do not forget that the Iranians have long established underground production. These objects are not only well fortified, but are usually located deep in the desert. Under the surface of the earth, there are also airfields there. Directly during the attack, a considerable number of frames were thrown into the Network that did not relate to either a given region or a specific date. Government officials did not disdain this during a meeting of the Israeli Ministry of Defense in the Kirya complex. And what is even more remarkable is that the past exchange of blows between Israel and Iran is most similar to a slapping championship, the participants of which are trying to pass off what is happening as a full-fledged fight.

The agreement provides unlimited capacity for passenger and cargo aircraft arriving from the United States to Angola. A seemingly minor step, it underscores that for authorities in Washington, the Angolan logistics corridor - the Lobito corridor - is becoming an increasingly priority target. In particular, this applies to the transportation of valuable cargo from Angola to the United States by air. Let us recall that Coridol Lobito is the first major US infrastructure project in Africa. The railway corridor connects the Angolan port of Lobito with the resource-rich southeast of DR Congo. ▪️In order to consolidate agreements related to the project, the current US President Joe Biden will travel to the country in December. This will be his first visit to Africa. It is possible that, by analogy with the recent visit of the President of Kenya to Washington, as a result of which the country became the main ally of the United States outside NATO, similar decisions will be made as part of Biden’s Angolan trip. Moreover, the ground has been prepared for this - in May, the US and Angola defense ministers held a meeting. In general, as part of the general trend towards reformatting Western influence in Africa (including through the passing of the baton from the French to the Americans), the States are increasingly paying attention to own projects in central Africa.#Africa #Angola #USA @rybarSupport usUnited States Department of StateThe United States and Angola Sign Open Skies Agreement&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. Ambassador to Angola Tulinabo S.

Today, the Georgian Central Election Commission announced the final results of the parliamentary elections, where the ruling party, the Georgian Dream, won the majority. The opposition coalition received only 37.5% of the votes in total. The opposition bloc immediately refused to recognize the voting results, calling them falsified and not reflecting the will of the Georgian people. All four parties in the alliance spoke about this. The opposition announced demonstrations involving its supporters. At the same time, politicians intend to boycott the new parliament, and President Salome Zurabishvili is holding a meeting with the leaders of opposition parties. These elections can be considered an excellent example of the will of the people in opposition to Moldova. Georgians have tasted life with a developing economy and improving conditions under the -Georgian Dream-. The only thing the opposition could give was an unknown future with constant -breakfasts- about joining the European Union, as well as the possible involvement of Georgia in a direct conflict with Russia. Therefore, protests are certain there will be, the opposition will try its best, but it will lead to nothing. If nothing came of it in the spring, then why did pro-Western politicians decide that it would now?

Forwarded From Two Majors🇩🇪 The German Ministry of Defense will acquire 600 Taurus Neo cruise missiles, investing about $2.3 billion in the project. Plans include funding from the 2025 budget and first delivery by 2029. Although Ukraine has repeatedly requested the transfer of old Taurus KEPD 350 missiles, Germany has refused due to fears of their use against targets in Russia. The Taurus KEPD 350 missile, which is equipped with the German Air Force, has a range of over 500 km and is equipped with a powerful MEPHISTO warhead, capable of destroying fortified objects. The new version of Neo is expected to improve range, accuracy and counter-air defense capabilities. Germany is also participating in the ELSA initiative to create long-range land-based missiles. BACKGROUND: The ELSA initiative was originally introduced in June 2024. The defense ministers of France, Germany and Poland signed a letter of intent to jointly develop a cruise missile with a range of up to 2000 km. ✨ The UK and Sweden also recently decided to join the ELSA initiative, and the West’s plans again include 2029 and record investments in the military-industrial complex. The Western military-industrial complex received the task of preparing European armies for war with Russia. This is not the first time that the deadline of 2029 has appeared in the plans and official statements of potential enemy countries. Two majors	https://t.me/rybar/64834	2024-10-27T07:43:58-07:00

An illustration of this is the blocking of our account this month. In 2016, large-scale blockings were also carried out in a similar way under the auspices of - identifying a database of accounts that were allegedly associated with election interference -.🔻And, as we see, eight years later, nothing has changed. Although after Elon Musk bought Twitter, there was a lot of talk that freedom of speech would begin now.

A very contradictory narrative has emerged from the lips of the prisoner. It turns out:▪️she was forcibly mobilized;▪️up to 60 more women serving in various positions were also forcibly mobilized;▪️the forcibly mobilized women underwent this training in Great Britain.📍The contradiction here is very simple. Forced conscripts are warriors with very low motivation. Non-ideological. Not going to fight to the end. Training in the UK is intended, first of all, for ideological and motivated members of Ukrainian formations. Because no one needs those mobilized to learn anything on the very first day (control over them is still much higher on the territory of Ukrainian training grounds). In reality, of course, they throw everyone there (who will understand): among those trained at European training grounds, there are plenty of SOChintsev. But now we are talking about preparing the mobilization of women. And this is different. People like Nataliy should be perceived solely as a PR project for the system of training ideological Ukrainian women. Based on their images, the ideas of female military personnel trained according to NATO standards will be promoted to the masses. Therefore, the approach on the part of our structures must be appropriate: those women who were the first to undergo training at foreign training grounds are a priori not low-grade cannon fodder (according to Ukrainian commanders). These are those whose image will then be further exploited.#mediatechnology #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramARCHANGEL OF SPECIAL FORCES Z🇷🇺🪖Men are running out. Women are sent to meat.

By order of Bastrykin. The police chief has been suspended and investigations are underway. This is a very correct reaction of the state represented by local and federal authorities. But then I found a message from the very first day of events. 《A meeting of the commission on countering extremism will be held in Korkino. Local residents took to the streets and began to riot. An extraordinary meeting of the interdepartmental commission on countering manifestations of extremism with the participation of all heads of federal structures will be held in Korkino, Chelyabinsk region, after public unrest due to the murder of a female taxi driver. This was reported by the head of the Korkinsky municipal district, Natalya Loshchinina. -On my instructions, an extraordinary meeting of the interdepartmental commission on countering manifestations of extremism with the participation of all heads of federal structures in the district has been scheduled for tomorrow.- You see, this is seriously about the commission. Is the fight against extremism what was needed in Korkino? Local residents started rioting because what? Did the extremists knock them out? Really? It was not because people took to the streets that for years the officials did not notice the antics of the Roma community. Not because the gypsy baron promised to somehow solve something according to gypsy laws. No. Some extremist villains are to blame for everything, so it turns out? It was not the decision to assemble a security commission. Do not discuss the quality of work of law enforcement agencies. I even know what such commissions can decide. Strengthen activities to strengthen interethnic friendship and condemn manifestations of nationalism. Hold some kind of festival. I think that it is even possible to arrange a mass screening of the film -The Return of Budulai- for residents of the city. Although no. There, the gypsy Budulai fights the gypsy mafia, and at the end of the last episode he beats up the bandits. All Soviet boys watched the film just for this episode. Some kind of extremist, that Budulai from the movie. The Gypsy Baron condemns this. And in the light of events, by the way, the question arises: who is the gypsy baron, what is this, what kind of subject of law is this? Absolutely correctly, Alexander Kartavykh asks the question why on earth a fan of role-playing games, who calls himself a baron, does what he wants. At what point did the police and the authorities in Korkina forget that they are the authorities and where did they lose their monopoly on violence given by the state? Maybe the state will already have enough support for these role-playing games? Otherwise, here is a baron, here is the head of the diaspora, you don’t understand who is here yet. Where is the state? Telegram Kartavykh Alexander Let me explain with an example. Who is this in the photo?

All 5 leading political parties were admitted to them: the ruling liberal democrats (UzLiDeP), people's democrats (PDPU), social democrats (-Adolat-), environmentalists (EPU) and DPMT. The latter, the nationalist -Milliy Tiklanish-, announced in its election program that will - fight for the development of the economic sphere through national values ​​along with the careful preservation of historical and cultural heritage -. 📌The party was remembered during the campaign for its fresh initiatives to punish officials for not using the Uzbek language, banning -Soviet ideology-, and its leader Alisher Kadirov even managed to check in with the Russian Foreign Ministry, recommending him to mind his own business. 🔻Apparently, the latest aggravation between Tashkent and Moscow indirectly affected domestic Uzbek politics. The role of the party as a Russophobic lightning rod turned out to be more important than Turkic unity, as we wrote about earlier. But at the same time, this is a recognition that the party’s current agenda is too toxic for unification with the ruling liberal democrats, which means that Russia has freedom of maneuver in relations with Uzbekistan.#Uzbekistan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usTelegramRepost.uzThe Milliy Tiklanish party announced its election programhttps ://repost.uz/progress-osnovanniy-na-cennostyah💪 Subscribe to Repost	https://t.me/rybar/64824	2024-10-27T00:30:01-07:00

Against the backdrop of many foreign mercenaries and active NATO military personnel in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the activity is useless from a media point of view. Without revealing secrets, the Supreme Commander clearly outlined the party line on this issue: the DPRK takes a responsible approach to the Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between Russia and the DPRK, and especially paragraph 4 of the Treaty: -If one of the Parties is subjected to an armed attack by any state or several states and thus finds itself in a state of war, then the other Party will immediately provide military and other assistance with all means at its disposal. ✨ Thus, the Russian Army continued to develop success in a number of areas, increasing the pace of advance at the front in recent weeks. Retaining territory in the Kursk region for the Ukrainian Armed Forces remains politically justified on the eve of the US elections; the Kiev regime did not even spare Abrams tanks for futile counterattack actions. At this time, the Russian Armed Forces, in heavy battles, mix up the concentrated enemy with strikes from FAB and artillery. In the future, armed provocations and attacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine are predicted on certain sectors of the front during the voting period in the United States, a reduction in the mobilization age in Ukraine to 21 years (sweetened by the fact that it is not up to 18 years) and the continuation of military-technical assistance from the West to Kyiv in order to prolong the conflict for permanent causing damage to Russia.

Forwarded From Two Majors #Review #Summary for October 27, 2024 ▪️ The current week ends with news about the significant successes of the Russian Army in a number of areas. ▪️So, the defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine fell in two cities in the Pokrovsky direction: Selidovo was taken, footage with our flags is coming from Gornyak. ▪️In the Yuzhnodonetsk direction, the Russian Armed Forces broke through several kilometers forward, starting battles in Shakhtyorskoye, Bogoyavlek, Novoukrainka. ▪️In the Kupyansk-Limansky direction, our control zone is expanding at the Kruglyakovsky ledge near the river. Oskol, on the Adreevka-Vishevoye direction, after the liberation of Nevsky, Russian units broke into Sadovoe. ▪️In the Kursk region, despite the frantic counterattacks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with the support of columns of armored vehicles, our units not only held back these attempts, but also continued to push the enemy in a number of directions to the border, increasing the number of personnel with Ukrainian prisoners of war. ▪️It is important to note the ongoing attacks on the port infrastructure of the Odessa region. In addition to the detonation of a lot of ammunition, Ukraine’s economic support is being reduced in the form of physical restrictions on exports, primarily of metals and grain. ▪️ The main international event was the BRICS summit in Russia. The UN Secretary General, who was condemned by Zelensky for his visit to Russia, rationally responded that it was impossible not to attend a meeting of the heads of countries of more than half of humanity. Everyone at the forum understood perfectly well, and some even voiced, that BRICS was becoming a counterweight to the G7, which was economically justified. Thus, according to economists’ forecasts, in the next 5 years it is the BRICS countries that will surpass the Anglo-Saxon associations in terms of indicators. The rejection of the dollar in international payments continues. The United States and its satellites dug a hole for themselves by trampling on property rights, stealing Russia’s money in foreign accounts and showing the insignificance of guarantees for safe business with government entities of the Americans and the British. ▪️ Meanwhile, in Moldova, the presidential elections and the results of the referendum on this poor country’s accession to the EU were rigged. The outcome was decided by the votes of Moldovan citizens living abroad, while in Russia, 4 polling stations were opened for 500 thousand Moldovans and 10 thousand ballots were printed. Considering the transformation of the territory of Moldova into a Ukrainian substitute by NATO countries and the aggressive Romanianization of the country, the forecast remains disappointing. ▪️ In Georgia, the pro-Georgian party wins the parliamentary elections, which with its actions annoyed the globalists from the EU and NATO. Guided by national interests, the economic feasibility of further construction of port infrastructure for the transit of goods from China, the rationality of good neighborly relations with Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Russia, the Georgian Dream party came into direct conflict with the interests of the United States and the EU in the region. The pro-American opposition is preparing speeches, the arrival in the country of odious Ukrainian politicians (Goncharenko), professing the values ​​of the godless banned LGBT, has been noticed. ▪️ Returning to the front, it is important to note that the enemy is still strong, although very demotivated. Which, however, does not lead to his immediate surrender at the sight of Russian troops. The Armed Forces of Ukraine have a lot of foreign heavy equipment, they use HIMARS MLRS to attack our advancing units, there were reports of the enemy using, by some miracle, the Soviet self-propelled 203-mm cannon that he had -Pion-. However, video footage from the same Selidovo shows that the housing stock was not so badly damaged during the assault, which indicates some signs of depletion of enemy forces in certain directions. ▪️ The above-mentioned depletion of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is complemented by daily footage of the atrocities of the TCC for the forced capture of people in Ukraine, which favorably contrasts the method of staffing the Russian Armed Forces with contract soldiers on a voluntary basis. Although, a deferred problem remains the issue of Russian citizens mobilized in 2022, who in some units are forced to sign a contract under the threat of being sent to assault units, regardless of the military system.

At least one unit of armored vehicles was blown up by mines, and the landing force was scattered by UAVs and artillery strikes. Fighting also continues in the Korenevsky district. The enemy tried to attack in the area of ​​​​the Green Way, but was detected in a timely manner and covered with artillery fire. In addition, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced that attacks in the Pogrebkov area had been repelled.🔻No changes in control zones have been observed in the Sudzhansky district; fighting continues. Russian troops are striking at identified enemy positions, as well as in the Sumy region. In particular, in the Belovody area, another self-propelled gun of the Ukrainian formations was destroyed by a UAV strike - Inokhodets. It’s curious, if earlier in this direction - Pacers - were used over the territory of Russia, now they have already begun to fly into the Sumy region.

Today's reports from the fields continue to please with the progress of the Russian Armed Forces in several sectors of the front at once. Significant successes of Russian troops are also being recorded in the Yuzhnodonetsk direction.▪️Units of the Russian Armed Forces launched several local attacks at the Bogoyavlenka-Katerinovka line, and also started fighting in Bogoyavlenka. Previously, the forest belts between Vodyanoy and Bogoyavlenka near the Ikryanaya gully, the Dobrovolsky forest, as well as a large stronghold came under the control of Russian attack aircraft, which allowed them to begin the assault on the village. ▪️Artillery is actively operating on Epiphany itself, and UAV operators are destroying enemy armored vehicles. The farms to the west were used by the enemy as shelters for equipment and more than once became the target of airstrikes by the Russian Aerospace Forces. ▪️But the most large-scale progress is observed in the square between Zolotaya Niva, Shakhtarsky, Novoukrainka and Prechistovka. Over the past two days, units of the 40th Brigade and units of the 36th Army were able not only to knock the enemy out of several forest belts and large settlements, but also to start battles for Shakhterskoe and Novoukrainka, where they had already latched on to the buildings.🔻As a result of rapid attacks, the enemy was knocked out from territory of about 50 square kilometers in just over two days, and during the battles, a rare 2S7 -Pion howitzer for the Ukrainian Armed Forces was destroyed. There is also still conflicting information about the advance at the Maksimilyanovka - Pobeda line: judging by the footage from the enemy, the Ukrainian formations have lost ground in one of the forest belts.

Its electorate in the capital and other cities of the country has already begun to celebrate its victory. Representatives of the political movement announced their intention to receive 90 of the 150 mandates. In this case, it will receive a parliamentary majority and will be able to achieve its goal - to reduce the influence of political opponents who want to open a second front against Russia, as well as to continue a balanced course. At the same time, representatives of the opposition have already managed to declare their victory. This was done absolutely intentionally - after the official announcement of the results, it will be possible to declare fraud, refuse to recognize the results and bring supporters into the streets. With a high probability, events will develop exactly according to this scenario.

At the same time, it is unclear at what period the enemy established control over it.🔻The area to the south is heavily swamped and represents a gray zone, which we have already written about several times before. Taking into account the presence of the enemy in this fortified area, there simply cannot be any talk of control of Grigorovka and especially Serebryanka, the capture of which was previously reported to the Ministry of Defense.▪️In the Belogorovka area the situation remains stable. Russian troops hold the heights east of the settlement, as well as a fairly large fortified area in the Zolotarevka area and Zolotarevka itself, respectively.▪️But in the area of ​​Verkhnekamensky, which was liberated on paper, patterned attacks are again observed, the price of which was previously noticeable losses in equipment and manpower. Judging by the new footage published by the enemy, such tactics led to the death of another assault group.❗️Taking into account the fact that this stronghold blocks the path to Verkhnekamensky and is located forty meters above the settlement, there is no talk of liberating the village.

The attack was called -Days of Repentance.- And although the IDF press service reported on the effectiveness and achievement of all goals, in reality everything was somewhat different. In turn, the Iranian media announced that most of the missiles fired were shot down.▪️The main blow fell on Tehran and its environs: according to the Israeli side, the targets were Imam Khomeini International Airport and Mehrabad International Airport, as well as facilities of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, including the barracks near the Fatah highway. Footage appeared on the Internet, judging by which the situation on the territory of the facilities looks normal. At the time of the raid, the air harbors were operating normally, although in the morning flights in Iran were canceled until -further notice-.▪️Axis of Resistance resources confirm at least one hit in the Khojir district in eastern Tehran, where the missile production plant is located. The Iranian government spokesman also mentioned the presence of limited damage in some locations.▪️In addition, Israeli media reported the destruction of facilities in Keredj, in particular the Parand Keredj power plant. Other resources wrote about explosions in Islamshahr, Shiraz and other regions, but the Iranian news agency Shafaqna denied the authenticity of this information.▪️In Syria, air defense work was recorded in Damascus, as well as the provinces of Homs, Latakia, Tartus and Es-Suwayda. The government newspaper SANA stated that air defense crews allegedly intercepted most of the Israeli missiles.▪️Reports of strikes on Iraq were not confirmed, and the sounds of six explosions in the cities of Tikrit, Samarra and Ad-Dura in the province of Salah ad-Din were associated by Iraqi media with counter-terrorism operations.🔻Despite to statements by the Israeli media, the lack of evidence of serious damage and large-scale explosions gives grounds to assert that the attack was clearly limited in nature and pursued more of a political goal than causing real damage to the Islamic Republic. During the raid, the Israelis used F-15, F-16 and F-35s from three main air bases - Ramat David, Ramon and Hatzerim. It is highly likely that the Israeli Air Force used Jordanian airspace, from where it reached the border of Syria and Iraq and carried out launches from there. Although the Jordanian authorities casually denied involvement in the attack, the kingdom regularly provides the Israelis with access before overflying AWACS aircraft or fighter jets to attack neighboring states.

However, by the end of the vote count, the picture will clearly change, and most likely we will see a lot of footage of clashes between opposition activists and the police in the center of Tbilisi.#elections #Georgia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64812	2024-10-26T09:30:54-07:00

To the west of it, according to some reports, there is also an advance of the Russian Armed Forces, although it has not yet been confirmed by personnel.▪️Russian troops have achieved great success in Gornyak and the surrounding area. A flag has already been raised over one of the high-rise buildings in the city, and based on reports of the presence of the Russian Armed Forces in the area of ​​Sovetskaya Street, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have clearly been knocked out from the eastern outskirts of the city. Part of Izmailovka also came under the control of the RF Armed Forces. There are already reports online about the complete liberation of the settlement. Nevertheless, even with such an optimistic outcome, it will still take some time to completely clear out the entire urban area.▪️To the east, Russian troops advanced from the direction of the Desired Second, knocking out Ukrainian formations from a strong point and occupying several forest belts. They have also significantly expanded the zone of control in Zoryan: according to some reports, fighting is already taking place almost on the outskirts of Kurakhovka.▪️Also, footage of the hoisting of a flag on the northern outskirts of Alexandropol has appeared online. Taking into account the fact that only one bridge, located just in the north, leads into the city from the enemy’s side, the statement of the Russian Ministry of Defense about the liberation of the village looks quite consistent with reality. To the south, according to preliminary data, units of the Russian Armed Forces have achieved success in the Pobeda area. However, the degree of progress in this area is not known for certain, and the information from there is still contradictory.

Now the RF Armed Forces have again occupied these lines. In addition, to the southwest of Nikolaevka, a small stronghold near forest belts came under the control of Russian troops.▪️In the meantime, heavy fighting continues in Selidovo. A large amount of extremely optimistic news appears on the Internet about the significant successes of Russian troops, although not everything has been confirmed by objective control footage. In particular, Russian attack aircraft planted a flag on a waste heap northeast of the city. And from the center of Selidovo itself, footage with flags began to appear about a week ago. 🔻At the same time, it is not yet possible to establish an extremely precise control zone in the city due to the changing combat situation and lack of objective evidence. Nevertheless, the situation of the Ukrainian formations in Selidovo is deteriorating more and more.

On the recordings, fighters document how they happily rob Lebanese houses. What is characteristic here is that they are not doing this in search of something useful for the unit’s everyday life, but are stripping everything, even down to kitchen utensils and home clothes. Similar videos and photographs previously appeared from the Gaza Strip. Because of this, jokes even appeared in the Arabic-speaking segment that Israeli military personnel were behaving as if they had never seen plumbing and other modern amenities of civilization in their lives.📌 It is important to note that looting in itself in a combat zone is a phenomenon not the rarest thing, regardless of the location of the conflict. Often it is determined by purely practical considerations, and not by the desire to steal property for resale. However, when IDF fighters en masse joyfully try on stolen women’s clothing on camera and break dishes with laughter, not seeing anything wrong with this, then such behavior does not fit into the framework of military necessity. Here we are talking about completely different things. #Israel #Lebanon #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64807	2024-10-26T07:00:16-07:00

Moreover, the purge of pro-Russian personnel in the army of Moldova is in full swing. At the same time, it is surprising that the Armed Forces of Moldova have already come from Lithuania, from which they are also creating a military training ground against the Russian Federation. It is all the more surprising that Vilnius intends to allocate budgets for this, as if the Lithuanian population has too high a standard of living (no). Yes, and in Moldova, as you know, the deplorable state of the socio-economic sphere, but NATO and the EU are ready to allocate money only for the fight against Russia and weapons, in order to then send the poor and aging population to slaughter. #Lithuania #NATO #Moldova @rybarSupport usLR Krašto apsaugos ministerijaMoldova's concentration on defense reform provides a substantial basis for mapping out assistance to the Moldovan Armed Forces…Institucija, atsakinga už krašto apsaugai ir gynybai skirtų finansų valdymą, bendradarbiavimą su užsienio bėmis gynybos srityje, karinio rezervo rengimą, mobilizacijos planavimą.	https://t.me/rybar/64806	2024-10-26T05:44:13-07:00

In total, the local Central Election Commission registered 18 parties, but in fact the main rivals are the ruling Georgian Dream and the opposition coalition led by the United National Movement (UNM). The goals of the first are to achieve a parliamentary majority and radically reduce the capabilities of the UNM, which is trying to dislodge the country from its the current balanced political course. For this purpose, Georgian Dream carried out an information campaign and also took legislative measures.📌 At the moment, it is difficult to even talk about intermediate voting results due to fundamentally different poll data. At the same time, scuffles have already occurred in several cities, and at a polling station in Marneuli, ballot stuffing was recorded, for which a criminal case has already been initiated. And regardless of the results, this night is unlikely to be without street protests by the opposition, for which it was clearly preparing long before the elections. UNM supporters will not have to look for a reason - it will be enough to simply accuse the authorities of rigging ballots to provoke unrest. #elections #Georgia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64803	2024-10-26T04:25:12-07:00
🎬🖼 🇮🇱🇮🇷 This night the announced Israeli strike on Iran too...	🇮🇱🇮🇷 This night the announced Israeli strike on Iran took place in retaliation for the massive Iranian missile attack a few weeks ago. It was postponed several times for various reasons, including due to the leak of secret American documents about the possible goals of the IDF. The parties have opposite opinions about the results of the raid. The Israelis claim that they were able to hit some key targets in the Islamic Republic, including military bases. In Tehran, they deny the extensive damage and report limited damage. There are few images of the moments of the attack on the Internet, and old videos from other locations are being uploaded onto the Internet. Around 4 am, the country's authorities limited the Internet for several hours to prevent the dissemination of information about the results of the attack.❗️However, there is apparently no talk of the destruction of nuclear facilities or oil production infrastructure, the damage to which could cause serious damage to the Iranian economy. Therefore, with a certain probability, the IDF attack was indeed limited in nature. At the same time, Axios, citing its sources, reported that the Israelis, through third countries, warned the authorities in Tehran about the attack and even outlined a list of targets that they plan to hit . In the message, they also warned Iran against retaliating by threatening a more massive raid.#Israel #Iran@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64799	2024-10-26T03:05:20-07:00

And what are the Chinese doing? In October, the command of the People's Liberation Army of China decided to amaze everyone with the scale of its training, since this month the Chinese are holding three major exercises at once. ▪️The first began on October 13, and the PLA Air Force was involved in it. Before the start of the event, fighters and bombers were deployed to four air bases in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The main emphasis in this exercise is on the withdrawal of aviation from attack, as well as the use of the aviation component from remote air bases in the event of an armed conflict.▪️The second exercise is strategic nuclear forces of the PLA missile forces, which started on October 21. Ground units are involved in it - units that are armed with medium-range ballistic missiles and intercontinental ballistic missiles. In total, 107 launchers of various types are involved in this training. According to the plan, the Chinese are also practicing an armed conflict in which the strategic component of the PLA will be involved.▪️The third exercise began on October 22 in the South China Sea. Chinese sailors are participating in it as part of an aircraft carrier strike group led by the Liaoning aircraft carrier and escort ships. The main emphasis in Beijing was on demonstrating its presence in the disputed zone of the Spratly Islands, the rights to which are claimed by the Philippines. The actions of the PLA are actively monitored by American planes and drones. The Chinese have taken seriously the training of the armed forces, conducting exercises one after another, which was not observed in past years. Now all this is taking place against the background of the exercise of US strategic forces Global Thunder 25. It is worth adding that Chinese reconnaissance UAVs and aircraft are also tirelessly monitoring the Russian border, but for what purpose it is unclear.

And here it is. And, of course, now is the time to go to forums and other events held by the British. But what we should learn from the British adversary is consistency. Istanbul has been a nest of British intelligence since the 18th century. Either the Circassians or the Poles were welcomed there, after both uprisings.

🇨🇳🇺🇸 The United States seems to be planning to expand the rol...	🇨🇳🇺🇸 The United States appears to be planning to expand the role of the country's coast guard in the Asia-Pacific region. Vice Admiral Andrew Tiongson recently stated that the BCHR intends to intensify work with regional partners. In particular, such cooperation will be expressed in joint activities. We are talking about multilateral patrols, as well as participation in new training with allied countries. 🔻In addition, it became known that Tiongson was on a visit to Japan last month. One of his main goals is to find locations from which the US Coast Guard can conduct operations in the region on a regular basis. However, the American side has not yet provided specific details of the trip. By the way, in the Asia-Pacific region there is a trend towards increasingly frequent deployment of the coast guard to patrol waters or perform other tasks. Using the capabilities of the coast guard is a way to indicate a presence in a particular water area without involving the fleet, which can lead to unnecessary escalation. For example, skirmishes in the disputed South China Sea most often involve ships under the auspices of this department. One of the reasons is the need to keep the conflict under control. It is worth noting that such attention to the topic on the part of the United States can be associated with the growing activity of the Chinese coast guard in the Asia-Pacific region. Therefore, we should expect more and more American ships to appear in the region in the near future as a response to the latest trends.#China #USA @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usThe Japan TimesWith ramped-up activities, U.S. Coast Guard plots greater Indo-Pacific roleThe move comes at a time when a growing number of coast guards in the region are becoming deeply involved in patrolling disputed waters.	https://t.me/rybar/64796	2024-10-26T00:27:58-07:00

Filtration measures were periodically carried out on the territory of local schools and medical institutions. ▪️An Indonesian hospital was surrounded by armored vehicles, and Kamal Adwan Hospital was under fire. The population was evacuated from the territory of the city's former educational institutions through the Salah ad-Din highway. At the same time, local factions - the Palestinian resistance - constantly reported successful ambushes on Israelis. However, the attacks and strikes by the militants did not lead to any tangible results; the IDF did not stop its raids.▪️In the central part of the enclave, Israeli air and artillery strikes on Hamas targets continued. Nuseirat still remained under the most concentrated fire, and dozens of people became victims. ▪️In response, Hamas and other groups fired at IDF positions in the Netzarim corridor. However, the Palestinians did not achieve much success, and almost no losses were reported among the Israelis.▪️In the south of the Gaza Strip, there was also no significant activity of Israeli forces. In turn, Palestinian formations carried out incursions and shelling from time to time.▪️The Israelis observed regular air and drone strikes on Hamas positions. Congestions of civilians were often targeted, and news of casualties was received daily.▪️Police raids by Israeli security forces continued in the West Bank. Thus, since October 7, 2023, more than 11,400 Palestinians have been detained.#video #digest #map #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/64795	2024-10-25T23:01:38-07:00

Forwarded From Informant So far, there are no signs of attacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities and the military-political elite of the country, which makes it clear about the relative restraint of Israel’s strike, which warned Iran through third countries. Obviously, not without pressure from the United States, which is not interested in escalation. Further actions of the Islamic Republic will depend on how sensitive the attacks from the Israeli Air Force turned out to be: if the damage is minimal, you can declare that the attack was successfully repelled and not take further actions, just like that happened in April, when Israel, in response, destroyed one radar from the S-300PMU2 air defense system in the vicinity of Isfahan, which was not noticed by the Iranian authorities. However, the more likely scenario is a missile-unmanned attack from Iran and/or the Axis of Resistance, however less large-scale than in October and April and aimed purely at not losing face.

The event itself occurred a few days ago during the reflection of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ attack on Novoivanovka. Also in this area, UAV operators destroyed the M113 armored personnel carrier of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In the Sudzhansky district, the configuration of the front near the state border line was clarified. Judging by the enemy footage that appeared on the Internet, Daryino is currently occupied by Ukrainian forces. Footage of the landing of the Russian Armed Forces in the forest belt to the north-west of the settlement has been published. As the BMP was withdrawing, unfortunately, it was blown up by an anti-tank mine. The lack of control of Russian troops over the village is also confirmed by daily data from the Russian Ministry of Defense, which reports shelling of Ukrainian Armed Forces positions in Darino. Judging by the video, the event took place no more than two or three days ago.▪️On the opposite flank of the Sudzhansky district, the enemy attempted to advance in the Plekhovo area, but did not achieve any success. To the east of the settlement, Russian troops recently destroyed an International Maxx Pro armored vehicle, blowing up the ammunition in it along with the personnel.

Forwarded From UndersideTurkish Gambit: British attempts to undermine Russia continueThe Underside editors learned that the lesson with the expulsion of British diplomats from Moscow did not teach the Foreign Office and the British intelligence services anything. The Englishwoman continues to shit. Now in the vastness of Turkey. Now in Istanbul, well-known to our readers, ELN is holding a forum - Eurasian Futures: Russia in a Multipolarizing World - at the Turkish Global Relations Forum (GRF). Under the control of MI6, the European Leadership Network invites Russian political scientists, lawyers, economists, civil servants to research projects, to seminars and forums, and then elicits from them insider information of a strategic nature about the Russian Federation. The list of servants of the British crown includes: the favorite of the Royal Family Igor Yurgens, Academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences and President of IMEMO RAS Alexander Dynkin, ex-head of the RIAC Andrei Kortunov, Kommersant journalist Elena Chernenko and a long list of names that can be refreshed in memory. Let us remind you that ELN is currently working on a project to study possible scenarios for the development of the future of Russia, which they are doing on behalf of the Foreign Office and MI6 employee Christopher Joyce. In January 2024, he allocated 668 thousand pounds (more than 75 million rubles). Over the course of a year, ELN has been collecting information on the basis of which British intelligence will develop new subversive operations against our country. ELN and the Turkish GFR are long-time partners. The Forum's Board of Directors makes high-profile visits to London, Turkish experts write materials for ELN (for example, in support of Turkey in NATO). Since 2019, ELN on the GRF platform with the participation of RIAC has been holding events in Istanbul, the topics of which range from areas of international cooperation to new military technologies. The main topic of the meeting of leaders this year was migration trends in Central Asia and Russia. It is not surprising, since migration is a key area of ​​work for the Foreign Office and MI6 in Russia and in the countries of the post-Soviet space. Even in the first investigation, we mentioned Svetlana Gannushkina, who signed a grant agreement with the Foreign Office, and her supervisor was Jessica Davenport, an employee of the British Embassy expelled from Russia. One of the areas of Mrs. Gannushkina’s work as president of the Civic Assistance Committee was migration policy. And the grant agreement included more than 76 projects and a total budget of about 2 billion rubles, including organizations seriously involved in the problem of migration in Russia. Another expelled British spy, Blake Patel, specialized in working with Russian Muslims. The UK not only rocked the situation in Russia from the inside, but was also involved in the import of illegal migrants from Central Asian countries, using UN structures. Underside is checking the participants. But it is already known that Vadim Kozyulin, a professor at the Academy of Military Sciences of the Russian Federation and the head of the Center for Global Studies and International Relations of the Diplomatic Academy, and the Editor-in-Chief of the magazine -Company- Anna Oreshkina came to the meeting of agents from Russia. How London will use the information received from Russian experts is not difficult to guess .Forewarned is forearmed.	https://t.me/rybar/64775	2024-10-25T10:08:02-07:00

I walked through the workshops of Uralvagonzavod, which works around the clock, in two 12-hour shifts. No days off. The rear is the face of the front.✔️Here, civilian factory workers, military veterans, and those who are waiting for their relatives from the front work hard without days off. Here, for example, Yulia has a non-feminine set of professions - a revolver turner, a blacksmith, a chipper... She stamps bolts for tanks - such heavy dumbbells that need to be heated on a fire with tongs, put under a press and thrown into a box of finished products.

Before that, he served in the army, fought in Chechnya, and worked in the riot police. And with the beginning of the Northern Military District, he went to the front as a volunteer.

The problem of the influx of migrants to the UK is quite acute. The tension in society provoked by the current situation is eloquently reflected in the August anti-migrant protests. ▪️The previous government tried to solve this issue by intimidating migrants. However, this tactic cannot be called successful. In early October, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper admitted that the new ruling party was having significant difficulties in delivering on its promise to close refugee hotels. The bill for each asylum seeker has risen from £17,000 to £41,000 in four years. 2023-2024 financial year. This significant increase in costs is due to the lack of cheap, available accommodation accommodation such as hostels, council flats or housing association properties.🔻The number of asylum seekers being housed in hotels continues to rise due to a major increase in the number of people arriving by boat via La Manche. The current situation creates a significant burden on the social support system and causes widespread public criticism. It is possible that the government will announce new measures aimed at solving the problem as part of the autumn budget.#Great Britain@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇬🇧 To continue the conversation about the unrest in Great BritainThe story of the massacre at a children's dance school has not left many people indifferent.

🖼 🇮🇩🇨🇳 On the activity of Chinese ships in disputed Indonesi...	🇮🇩🇨🇳 On the activity of Chinese ships in disputed Indonesian waters Amid the tense situation in some parts of the Asia-Pacific region, the problems of the disputed South China Sea have somehow gotten lost. But this week there have already been two incidents involving the Chinese and Indonesians. On October 21 and 24, the Indonesian coast guard, with the support of the country's armed forces, expelled a Chinese law enforcement ship from its exclusive economic zone. The Chinese, according to Indonesian authorities, tried to interfere with the work of a research vessel in the water area. 📌Indonesia is not often mentioned in the context of a territorial dispute in the waters. The fact is that Jakarta is not directly involved in it, since the authorities do not lay claim to the islands in the South China Sea. However, China’s territorial claims intersect with the border of Indonesia’s exclusive economic zone, which creates tension in bilateral relations.❗️By the way, this particular part of the water area is filled with gas and oil fields. A Chinese coast guard ship tried to interfere with the reconnaissance of one of them this week. There is clear dissatisfaction on the part of the PRC here, since Beijing considers these resources to be theirs. It is important to note that on October 20, that is, while the Chinese ship was in the exclusive economic zone of Indonesia, the inauguration of the country's new leader Prabowo Subianto as president took place in Jakarta . Of course, such a coincidence may be just a coincidence. However, this can be seen as a signal that the Chinese authorities are sending to the new Indonesian leadership. Despite the fairly high level of relations with Indonesia, the Chinese side indicates the continuation of its policy of asserting claims to the water area.

On October 24, North Koreans launched balloons towards the Republic of Korea for the 30th time since May of this year, to which local authorities responded with another call to stop such activities. However, unlike previous launches, the balloons did not carry garbage, but propaganda leaflets, mostly criticizing the current government in South Korea. There were also calls for South Koreans to emigrate due to high suicide rates and the level of the minimum wage. Note that the North Koreans launched propaganda leaflets for the first time in several years. Since May of this year, when the DPRK began to respond to the activities of South Korean activists, it was garbage balloons that were flying into the Republic of Korea. By the way, just two weeks ago, the North Korean authorities announced that South Korean drones were flying over Pyongyang. The drones scattered propaganda materials over the capital of the DPRK, which is why North Korea put artillery units near the border on alert. The North Korean leadership clearly perceived the drone flight as raising the stakes in the psychological war with South Korea that has been dragging on since May. Therefore, the launch of propaganda leaflets is likely a mirror response to the neighbor’s recent provocative actions. #DPRK #South Korea@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usYonhap News Agency(2nd LD) N.

In order to discuss further actions, a Defense Council was recently held at the Elysee Palace.▪️In addition to the Ivorian Port Boué, the Camp de Gaulle in Gabon and the Ouacame base in Senegal will soon be abandoned. It is likely that the French will remain exclusively as instructors at joint military facilities. And at the highest level, emphasis will be placed on joint exercises based on the American model. ▪️In fact, the latter is already being fulfilled: since the beginning of October, the French have conducted joint exercises with Cameroonian, Gabonese, Ivorian and Senegalese military personnel.📌The benefit for the French authorities in this is obvious - a reduction in bloated defense budgets, a switch to economic projects, as well as an attempt to create the image of an ally, and not a colonialist for Africans. And if something happens, there will always be an opportunity for the transit of forces through joint bases. But once again we note that the fact that French soldiers are leaving Africa does not mean the disappearance of Western influence on the countries. On the contrary, Washington is trying to seize the initiative, locking in cooperation with some African countries.

The authorities have accelerated this issue due to the withdrawal of 19 existing MiG-29s from the 601 and 602 squadrons due to poor condition and lack of spare parts for them. According to media reports, management is considering three options for replacement: the American F-16, the South Korean FA-50 and the French Rafale F4, and the latter are on the list of favorites. The cost of modernizing the fleet is included in the budget of the Peruvian Armed Forces for the next year, and it is planned to purchase a total of 10 single-seat modifications per squadron and 4 two-seat training variants.🔻And the key question in the context of the air defense system is where the decommissioned MiG-29 will go.

Moreover, the CSTO, since the beginning of the Northern Military District, and especially after Zelensky’s Kursk adventure, has found itself in an ambivalent position.

🇺🇸💰How crypto will help solve the US $35 trillion debt problem...	🇺🇸💰How crypto will help solve the US $35 trillion debt problem. During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump is increasingly demonstrating support for Bitcoin and crypto. Recently, when asked about the future of digital currencies, Trump suggested they could play a role in paying off the US government debt. It is clear that Republicans are eager to attract the attention of the growing base of cryptocurrency supporters. Trump also promised to make the United States the crypto capital of the world if he is re-elected. Trump recently became the first US president to make a transaction in Bitcoin. Kamala Harris also addressed the topic of digital assets during a fundraiser in New York. She promised to encourage innovative technologies such as AI and digital assets while protecting consumers and investors. Although she did not directly mention Bitcoin or crypto, her comments indicate that the US Democratic Party is also seeking to attract voters from the world of crypto. This is a noticeable change compared to her previous silence on this topic. We predicted this development of events back in March 2022, when, under the cover of military operations in the so-called. In Ukraine, the authorities of the USA, Britain and the EU very quickly introduced laws aimed at regulating the sphere of crypto-assets, monitoring user activity and tracking transactions. In two and a half years, it was possible to create acceptable conditions for the integration of the classical financial system and the world of crypto, on the terms of the SEC and the CIA, while respecting the interests of large investment funds BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street. Now the issuing model of the United States, as the largest financial center in the world, is in a strategic position dead end. The development of the country's economy directly depends on emissions, but the risks of inflation and prohibitive overheating of stock markets, especially in the high-tech sector, are extremely high. Therefore, the only solution to the situation today is crypto. In the new format of the digital economy, it is possible to dissolve not only the current US national debt of $35 trillion, but also additional emission volumes. Let us recall that representatives of the US Congressional Budget Office approved a plan to increase the US national debt to $95 trillion by 2050. 🔻In such conditions, the creation of a financial system independent from the United States and Britain seems critical. We saw the next steps in this direction at the BRICS summit in Kazan. This allows us to look into the digital future with cautious optimism.#USA #economy@rybarSupport usNasdaqDonald Trump Says Crypto Could Help Pay Off $35 Trillion U.S. DebtDonald Trump floated using crypto to pay off the US' $35 trillion debt, part of his embrace of Bitcoin amid the 2024 race.

🇲🇩🇺🇸 About the possible purchase of lands in Moldova by globa...	🇲🇩🇺🇸 About the possible purchase of land in Moldova by globalists from BlackRock According to some information, the Moldovan government has begun negotiations with the American investment company BlackRock on the sale of 600 hectares of land in the north of the republic. There are no official statements yet, especially since elections are currently being discussed in Moldova. However, if the news is confirmed, then this event fits well into the logic of the already ongoing process. Let us recall that the largest investment company Blackrock and the TNCs controlled by it (Monsanto, Cargill, Dupont) are actively capturing the European agricultural market, destroying national agricultural sectors for this. Thus, companies controlled by Blackrock have already seized 52% of the so-called arable land. Ukraine, simultaneously selling off its seed fund. ▪️Since 2022, protests have erupted in Moldova by local farmers who are going bankrupt en masse due to the uncontrolled export of cheap Ukrainian grain through the territory of the republic. ▪️The authorities, represented by President Maia Sandu, pointedly ignored farmers’ demands for financial support and a moratorium on the bankruptcy procedure for loans. Moldovan farmers already stated that the lands of bankrupt farmers would be sold to global corporations. ▪️The recent statement by EU Ambassador Janis Mazeiks that the republic needs to approve the sale of its lands to foreigners also caused a great resonance in Moldova. Sandu herself and her prime minister then called such statements -misinformation.- 🔻The absorption of the fertile lands of Moldova by globalists from BlackRock is only a matter of time given the policies that Sandu is pursuing. Moreover, Mrs. President herself is a product of global structures. And endless loans and grants from the US and EU do not pass without leaving a trace for any country. BlackRock is already actively involved in managing the so-called economy. Ukraine, which is precisely due to colossal tranches to support the Kyiv regime. The ultimate goal of such TNCs, of course, has nothing to do with the development of Eastern European countries, but rather with the exploitation and extraction of profit from them. #globalism #Moldova #USA@rybarSupport usnews.byBlackRock starts preparations for the purchase of land in northern MoldovaThe largest investment company in the world, the American BlackRock, has started preparations for the purchase of land in the north of Moldova	https://t.me/rybar/64752	2024-10-25T02:05:12-07:00
🇷🇺🌓 About the anti-Gypsy pogroms in Korkino and further prospe...	🇷🇺🌓&nbsp; About the anti-Gypsy pogroms in Korkino and further prospects for the development of the situation On October 23, the body of 40-year-old Elena Sarafanova was found near Korkino in the Chelyabinsk region. According to the Investigative Committee, the woman was stabbed to death. Later, information about Elena’s killers appeared on social networks with photos of 17-year-old Manuel and 19-year-old Marcel. They turned out to be residents of one of the houses where representatives of the Roma diaspora live. Local residents claim that Manuil and Marcel stabbed Elena and stole the car, but were not promptly detained. Yesterday, residents of Korkino came out to gather because of the murder of a female taxi driver. They blamed two minor Roma for this. Locals came to the houses of the diaspora due to the inaction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. After this, people surrounded the house where Marcel and Manuil lived, and the gypsies opened fire on them with small arms, after which the residents began to throw stones at the houses. The house was cordoned off by riot police and special forces, the dissatisfied people were detained, and the security forces entered the building. Later, information appeared in the Chelyabinsk media that all the detainees were released after drawing up reports of petty hooliganism. And the shooter at the locals was detained, and, according to unconfirmed information, a criminal case was opened against him. At the same time, where those accused of murdering the taxi driver are is unclear.📌 So, in addition to migrant problems, it’s time to talk about the Gypsy topic.▪️Gypsies are the most asocial element of any society. They do not work, are exempt from military service, do not pay taxes, do not recognize the state as such, but consider their camp to be the center of their lives. At the same time, they receive all kinds of benefits for children from the state - surreal, isn’t it? However, the main way of earning money for gypsies is crime. 99.9% of all gypsies are bandits who are dangerous to any neighbors.▪️Such incidents with them are far from new, they just usually turned a blind eye to it. And from the behavior of local authorities and security forces in Korkino now you can see how this happened. The administration's reaction is as follows: - Oh, how did this happen? - They sent riot police there. They, without thinking twice, began to arrest everyone. The media talk about 43 detainees, but without indicating a specific number of local residents and Roma. So we won’t be surprised if there are practically no gypsies there.❗️From the point of view of the current situation, the only positive point in all of this is that the head of the Investigative Committee, Alexander Bastrykin, has taken the matter under personal control, but even this does not mean that the local authorities will do anything do. In fact, they can arrest those involved in the murder of a woman, bring them to trial, and expel the rest of the representatives of the gypsy camp from the city somewhere to a remote place of compact residence, but based on the examples of past years, we doubt this. For the Korkino authorities, the benefit is that in order to slow down the situation, since the gypsies will pay off what happened with large sums, and the most notorious residents, in the opinion of the administration, who caused the riots, will be imprisoned and the case will be closed. We don’t know how everything will really turn out. We won't assume, we'll just observe. But we very much doubt that even such a resonance will somehow affect the situation of the Roma in Russia.#multinationalism #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64749	2024-10-25T00:16:01-07:00

One of the reasons for repeated postponements is fears that the census threatens to reveal an unsightly situation with the real size of the country's population and its socio-economic situation. Now, according to the Statistics Agency under the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan, the permanent population in the country is 37.4 million people, which makes the republic the largest in Central Asia. In addition, the World Bank has allocated a soft loan to Tashkent in the amount of $50 million for the modernization of the national statistics system back in 2022 year, and there are suspicions that the funds have long been spent on other purposes. Also, the census may again agitate Uzbekistan in terms of ethnicity, in particular in Karakalpakstan, where Uzbeks, according to some data, are already a relative majority. 🔻In total, Uzbekistan has been living without a census for 35 years, and government agencies should have long ago adapted to the available statistics; there is reason to believe that the census will be postponed this time too. Unless the Western partners, who are actively developing the economy of the republic, insist otherwise. in Uzbekistan finally received a new date. According to the draft presidential decree, the general census of the country's citizens will be held from July 15 to August 21, 2026. It was originally planned to conduct the census in 2022...	https://t.me/rybar/64748	2024-10-25T00:02:01-07:00

However, it is not required, since the West has such a vision in the person of the USA and the EU, which definitely do not need to take into account Russia’s interests in the region.#Azerbaijan #Armenia #Russia@rybarSupport usRIA NovostiPashinyan called participation in the BRICS summit important for ArmeniaPrime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan stated that his participation in the BRICS summit in Kazan is important for Armenia, since the agenda of the summit directly concerns the republic.

Forwarded From Two MajorsThe Supreme, commenting on today's BRICS summit, said an extremely interesting thing:▪️Russia, through Turkey, received proposals from Ukraine for negotiations, which it agreed to, but the next day the leaders of the Kyiv regime refused.✨At the same time, the story was separated from the Istanbul story - 2022, which means it wasn’t that long ago. Surely, the reason for Kiev’s withdrawal of its proposal was due to retaliation from the United States and Great Britain - the true masters of Kiev. The Supreme’s mockery of Zelensky is indicative: -president - the overdue one is no longer called - the leader of the regime -. Well, Turkey’s gratitude for mediation was also expressed by the Supreme Commander in the format: -thank you, but you will sort it out with your clients there.- Zelensky understands that peace on any terms is the path to the loss of his power. And its Western curators continue to solve the problem of causing military and economic damage to our country. We do not take into account the half-hearted comments of our speakers with hints at the complete and unconditional surrender of Ukraine; here the executors of the manuals have taken the theses to the point of absurdity, as always. The BRICS summit is simply a wonderful event , which really entails titanic shifts in world politics. But would it have been so successful if things weren’t going so well for the Russian Army?

First, there were unclear demonstrations by pro-Western supporters, and yesterday by supporters of the ruling Georgian Dream party. Citizens from all over Georgia gathered in Tbilisi in support of the current authorities. According to monitoring resources, the number of rally participants exceeded 100 thousand people.📌 Against this background, seeing the support received by the current leadership, the opposition became worried about a possible defeat in the upcoming parliamentary elections and are trying to consolidate efforts. Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili stated that it would be advisable The move would be a transition to coalition rule as it would end more than 30 years of single-party rule. She emphasized that four pro-Western parties will have to effectively govern the country and they are responsible for the implementation of the Georgian Charter - a plan for rapid accession to the EU, previously proposed by Zurabishvili to unite the opposition.🔻The plan of pro-Western politicians and structures is very clear. Their desire is victory over the Georgian Dream, and they see their only chance in unification. But, speaking about this charter as a key, Zurabishvili is lying, since only a few of the 17 signatories have any support. In this case, quantity does not equal quality, since the level of support for the ruling authorities is high due to the implementation of balanced policies aimed at the good of Georgian people. And this alone reduces the chances of the opposition, which acts for the benefit of the West.# Georgia@rybar support usformulaws.ge პრეზიდენტი კოალიციურ მმართველობაზე მმართველობაზე უდიდესი წინსვლა იქნება იქნება იქნება დავემშვიდობებით ერთპარტიულობასტელეკომპანია ფორმულას ოფიციალური ვებგვერდი ვებგვერდი ვებგვერდი ვებგვერდი. საინტერესო და გადამოწმებული ამბები ერთ სივრც ეში.	https://t.me/rybar/64732	2024-10-24T12:19:01-07:00

The key point was negotiations with the CEO of Baykar Defense, Haluk Bayraktar. The parties agreed to develop a roadmap for localizing the production of UAVs and loitering ammunition for them in Kazakhstan.📌 Military-technical cooperation between Turkey and Kazakhstan is developing by leaps and bounds. In 2023, it became known that the Kazakh military-industrial complex will build a plant for the assembly of drones -Anka- from TAI, which were purchased from Turkey in the amount of 18 units, but only three have been delivered so far. Now the Baykar company, known for its UAVs, is talking about a similar enterprise. Bayraktar- and -Akyndzhi-. So far, a road map has been presented, but given the intensity of contacts between the countries, we think that it will not take much time before an official agreement. From the point of view of building the Armed Forces of Kazakhstan, the choice is relatively cheap and effective against armies without their own air defense or for border control, which is what they want in Kazakhstan , let's explain. But from the point of view of the expansion of Turkish companies in Central Asia, the situation is getting worse.❗️Turkey has contracts with all countries of Central Asia, except Tajikistan. The Tajik authorities also considered the purchase of Bayraktarov. In the absence of an alternative, the Turks have captured the market for unmanned products, which strengthens their position in the region. If we recall the Organization of Turkic States, which is expanding its partnership with the republics of the region in military terms, the picture looks even more deplorable, where CSTO ally Russia has less and less places.#Kazakhstan #Turkey@rybarSupport uswww.gov.kzThe Minister of Defense of Kazakhstan visited the international exhibition SAHA EXPO-2024 in TurkeyIn Istanbul, a delegation led by the Minister of Defense Colonel General Ruslan Zhaksylykov took part in the opening ceremony of the IV International Exhibition of Defense and Aerospace Industry SAHA EXPO- 2024.The event allows you to get acquainted with the achievements…	https://t.me/rybar/64731	2024-10-24T11:45:11-07:00

The Limansk direction, which had remained static for a long time, began to move. Russian troops have liberated Novosadovoe, control of which allows them to launch a new offensive against the enemy’s bridgehead on the left bank of the Stallion. ▪️In the Makeevka area, the Russian Armed Forces advanced to the west, knocking out the Armed Forces of Ukraine from positions in forest belts. Russian units are gradually expanding their bridgehead on the right bank of the river and are trying to gain a foothold in nearby forests. To the north and south of the village, the Russian Armed Forces aligned the front line along the Zherebets riverbed, eliminating the bridgehead that had previously formed here. In this area, the enemy, according to some reports, is using reserve units from the 4th Presidential Brigade. ▪️In addition, Russian units squeezed Ukrainian formations out of the southern and northern parts of Nevsky, which created the preconditions for a further attack on the Terny-Yampolovka bridgehead. The enemy launched several counterattacks, all of which were repulsed. ▪️The other day it became known that by October 23, after several days of fighting, Russian troops completely liberated Novosadovoe. The attacks of the armored groups of the Russian Armed Forces were carried out along two beams to the northeast of the settlement, providing cover for the equipment. The footage of objective control published today allows us to say that the Ukrainian formations were driven out from the entire territory of the village and retreated to Terny. The positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the latter are regularly attacked by Russian aircraft. ▪️To the east of Torskoye, Russian units are attempting to overcome the defensive lines of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

🇨🇲 On the brink of life and death: Cameroonian President Paul B...	🇨🇲 On the brink of life and death: Cameroonian President Paul Biya Since early October, rumors began to circulate online about the death of 91-year-old Cameroonian President Paul Biya. This was due to the fact that he did not appear in public and was not present at any event.▪️Then the government did not find anything better than to announce his presence in Switzerland and prohibit conversations about his health. All this had the opposite effect, only creating more doubt about whether the President was alive. Of course, it later turned out that he was alive and well when he arrived in Yaounde. But unrest in Francophone Africa continued, as in France. 🔻And this is due to the fact that Paul Biya has been the guarantor of French influence in Cameroon for half a century. In addition, the elderly politician has no successor and, as we mentioned earlier, he is also planning to run in next year’s elections. A stable pro-French position is even reflected in the reluctance to cooperate with the Americans and enter into dialogue with the Angolophone separatists of Ambazonia in the north-west of the country . Therefore, the excitement about the probable death of the French protege is not accidental - the French are afraid of losing their last pawn in the French African system. And they are already supporting his son as -heir to the throne-.#Africa #Cameroon@rybarSupport usBBC News AfriqueLe président camerounais réapparaît enfin en publicLe président camerounais Paul Biya, âgé de 91 ans, a été vu en public pour la première fois depuis six semaines, sur fond de speculations concernant son état de santé.	https://t.me/rybar/64721	2024-10-24T07:24:01-07:00

A little later, the Israelis again attacked the territory of a neighboring state. This time the target was a bridge in the vicinity of El-Quseir in Homs province. Apparently, the facility was used to transfer weapons to Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon. According to the SAR Ministry of Defense, the strikes were carried out both from the occupied Golan Heights and from the airspace over northern Lebanon. SAR Armed Forces Lieutenant Sharaf Marez Mazhar Khalil was killed and seven more people were injured. In recent years, the Israelis have repeatedly struck targets in various regions of Syria.

Since Finland joined NATO, Finnish units have been the most active in military training. Currently, three combat training events are taking place nearby in the south of the country. ▪️From October 20 to 25, a training exercise for ground units to assess readiness in the event of an armed conflict is taking place at the Pohyankangas military training ground. About 1.5 thousand military personnel and 250 units of military equipment are involved in it.▪️Since October 21, a search and rescue exercise has been taking place in the Upinniemi area and the adjacent waters of the Gulf of Finland, in which the forces of the coast guard brigade are involved. And the training seems to be harmless, but the Finns sent out warnings about firing along the coast on these dates.▪️On the same day, at the same training ground - Pohyankangas - they organized artillery firing of units of the high-readiness Jaeger brigade - Pori - and an armored brigade. Residents of nearby settlements reported shots and explosions. 🔻The activity of the Finnish armed forces cannot but please the North Atlantic Alliance.

This night after the terrorist attack, the Turkish command carried out a complex operation to defeat positions and objects used by the Syrian Democratic Forces and the Kurdistan Workers' Party or in one way or another with them related. The operation, authorized immediately after the PKK’s involvement in the terrorist attack was revealed, involved F-16C/D fighters, Akinci, Bayraktar, Anka drones and artillery units of the Turkish army. The targets of the Turkish attack were underground bunkers , places of deployment of Kurdish forces, oil depots and airfields, which are used in the interests of the Kurds. All night long, the north of Syria and Iraq was roaring with incessant explosions. The way we saw the complex operation, it all looks very much like fire preparations before an offensive. It is unknown whether the Turks will finally decide to begin the ground phase of the operation this time. They had been threatening this all year, but the terrorist attack itself looked ambiguous. Rumors have circulated in recent weeks about the PKK's readiness to negotiate. The day before, a nephew, Omer Ocalan, was admitted to the prison on Imrali Island, where PKK leader Ocalan is imprisoned. Before this, no one had spoken to the creator of the PKK for more than 40 months. And immediately after this, a strange attack on the plant occurs, which crosses out all agreements. At the same time, Erdogan flew from Kazan to Turkey, which may be connected with the upcoming National Security Council - it made decisions on the start of previous operations against the Kurds.❗️Another interesting fact is that a week before the terrorist attack and already during negotiations with the PKK The Turks increased the intensity of attacks on the Iraqi border. As a rule, the artillery is practically inactive or fires a few shells and that’s it. But this week more than 20 shots were recorded in just one section of the border. Add to this aviation training and the unanimous condemnation by the collective West of the actions of the PKK yesterday, and we get a complete picture in which the activation of the Turkish Armed Forces may be just around the corner, and the terrorist attack itself happened more than ever at the right time.

Special forces brigades and regiments have been operating in the Northern Military District zone since the very first days of hostilities. Although spetsnaz is broadly associated with assault, the profile of these special forces units lies elsewhere: for example, capturing prisoners, operating behind enemy lines, or conducting targeted destruction of targets. And such work is being carried out even now, albeit not on the scale of all troops. Therefore, when special forces are given the opportunity to carry out tasks in their direct profile, the result is visible to the naked eye. In particular, according to the enemy’s reports of increasing losses from ambushes, liquidations and other actions in his own rear.

🇰🇷🇺🇸🇰🇿☢️ How Americans control the Korean nuclear industry ...	🇰🇷🇺🇸🇰🇿☢️ How Americans control the Korean nuclear industry and what does Kazakhstan have to do with it The other day, the President of the Czech Republic conveyed, through Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky, an official invitation to the President of Kazakhstan to visit the country. One of the likely topics that the authorities of the two countries are discussing is cooperation in the field of nuclear energy with the participation of Czech and Korean companies. Indeed, quite recently, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, following a referendum, expressed a desire for an international consortium to build a nuclear power plant in Kazakhstan. ▪️ Something similar was recently started in the Czech Republic, where the South Korean company Korea Hydro &amp; Nuclear Power won the tender for the construction of new power units. KHNP was also included in the short list of contractors for the construction of nuclear power plants in Kazakhstan, along with the French EDF, the Chinese CNNC and the Russian Rosatom. ▪️However, the American company Westinghouse appealed the Czech victory of KHNP to the Office for the Protection of Competition. The French EDF also entered the same fight by filing a complaint with the European Commission: KHNP's proposal is proposed to be checked for compliance with fundamental principles, laws and norms of European law. KHNP is the main contractor for the construction of nuclear power plants using Korean equipment. However, due to the fact that the nuclear reactor, primary circuit equipment and fuel are sold using a large number of American patents, a legal conflict arises when constructing a nuclear power plant in a third country. It is necessary to request permission from the country that owns the nuclear technology - the United States - and enter into an appropriate agreement -1-2-3-. This was the case with the Barakah nuclear power plant in the UAE. 🔻Now the South Korean company in the international market is completely controlled by the United States, but if it gains access to other technologies, the balance of interests may change. That is why KHNP is interested in cooperation with the Czech Republic and Skoda. The latter actively participated in the construction of nuclear power units, was engaged in the production of almost all nuclear equipment and still holds licenses for the production of everything necessary for VVER-440 reactors and most of the equipment for VVER-1000. The tender for the Temelin NPP for KHNP and Skoda is an excellent occasion for consolidating a strategic partnership that is very beneficial to both parties:▪️ Skoda gets the opportunity to resume production of equipment for nuclear power plants and nuclear power plants, and in the future become KHNP’s constant companion in new nuclear power plant projects around the world;▪️ KHNP gains access to technologies free from American patent manipulation .🔻Further, such an alliance is capable of coming up with completely new nuclear power plant and even nuclear power plant projects, which will be based on technologies of Soviet origin, but with an abundance of developments from the two partner countries. The emergence of a competitor in the nuclear power plant construction market is clearly not part of the plans of the United States and France, so they are presenting a united front against the new initiative. In this regard, attempts to drag multi-vector Kazakhstan into the unfolding battle look very interesting. #USA #Czech Republic #Kazakhstan #energy @rybarSupport uswww.interfax.kzThe President of Kazakhstan is expected on an official visit in the Czech RepublicAstana.

In an interview with the Associated Press, the commander of the Hawaii-based 25th Infantry Division of the US Armed Forces said it was extremely important to station such equipment on the territory of the island nation. According to him, this will allow Typhon to be tested in the climatic conditions typical of the Philippines. Also, such a step will supposedly provide an understanding of how these medium-range missile launchers can be integrated and make adjustments to the American and Philippine deployment plans. 🔻And although the arguments given by Evans sound convincing, the importance of Typhon’s arrival in the region is justified by another, more significant factor. The Vel missile system creates a useful lever of pressure for the Americans, working both on the Philippine authorities and on the Chinese leadership. ▪️On the one hand, the deployment of a missile system can deter China from escalation in the region. At the same time, the American contingent does not even have to intervene directly, as required by the agreement between the authorities in Washington and Manila on mutual defense. ▪️On the other hand, the lack of clear guarantees for the permanent deployment of Typhon may deter the Philippines from unilaterally changing the status quo in the South China Sea. Otherwise, the decisions of the Philippine authorities could drag the United States into a large-scale confrontation with China. Thus, the indefinite deployment of Typhon in the Philippines gives the Americans a significant tool to influence the tense situation in the region. Testing the operation of equipment in other climatic conditions is an important factor, but after statements about the absence of plans to withdraw the missile system, it began to play a secondary role. #China #USA #Philippines @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usAP NewsUS missile deployment to Philippines 'incredibly important' for combat readiness, US general saysA US Army general says the deployment by the US military of a mid-range missile system in the northern Philippines was -incredibly important- and allowed American and Filipino forces to jointly train for the potential usage of such heavy weaponry in conditions…	https://t.me/rybar/64710	2024-10-24T00:22:33-07:00

The enemy is mining the area, especially access roads, using FPV drones and Baba Yaga. To n.p. Pokrovskoye are operating FPVs with the goal of destroying equipment on the distant approaches to Bakhmut. Despite this, units of the 98th Airborne Division, DK, 200th Motorized Rifle Brigade and 4th Motorized Rifle Brigade continue to work beyond the Seversky Donets-Donbass canal, expanding the bridgehead. During the recent surge The 331st RPD, acting suddenly, was able to capture the school on the move and significantly advance through the private sector to the west. On the left flank of the 217th RPD occupied a kindergarten and also occupied the entire private sector adjacent to the forest. Stupki-Golubovskie-2. The enemy is still holding the area of ​​multi-storey buildings and the Refractory Plant. But taking into account the advance of the 4th Motorized Rifle Brigade in the south, and the DK and 200th Motorized Rifle Brigade in the north, there is a threat of enveloping this garrison. This fact makes the Ukrainian Armed Forces nervous and launch counterattacks using tanks. The enemy has very few roads left to supply the garrison at Chasov Yar. The mud is coming, and it is already clear that even for light armored fighting vehicles the dirt roads are difficult to overcome, not to mention ordinary passenger vehicles. In the near future, these dirt roads will become impassable, and there will be only one road left, which is under the fire control of the RF Armed Forces. The battles for Chasov Yar are complex, determined by the terrain. But, despite everything, our units are pushing through the defense. It is too early to talk about the rapid fall of the city. Our troops also have enough problems. Everything will depend on a number of factors that, alas, we cannot disclose. Therefore, it may be that the city will fall within a month, or maybe within 3-4 months. This is the forecast taking into account the development of the situation. - Re-posted with an update - Archangel of Special Forces. Subscribe.	https://t.me/rybar/64694	2024-10-23T11:30:41-07:00

We talked about them in detail several weeks ago, but as the start date approaches, new interesting details have been revealed. ▪️In particular, American and Japanese military personnel will use Osprey convertiplanes for the first time on the territory of Yonaguni Island, located close to Taiwan. Aviation equipment will be used to practice the tasks of evacuating the civilian population. ▪️The United States will also deploy the HIMARS MLRS for the first time on Ishigaki, another remote Japanese island that is also located relatively close to Taiwan. Recently, the installation was delivered there through a civilian airport. By the way, the very fact of the deployment of such equipment caused indignation among some local residents. As a result, a group of activists staged a small protest near the air main, holding posters with the words -No to war.- No HIMARS-. 📌If you do not take into account the geographical location of the islands, there is nothing special about using such equipment in new areas of the exercises. However, the proximity of the territories to Taiwan signals that the Japanese and Americans continue to prepare for a potential military conflict in the region. These exercises actually practice the use of civilian airports for military purposes, the deployment of forces on remote Japanese islands and the evacuation of local residents from these territories. These skills are especially necessary in the event of a hypothetical Chinese invasion of Taiwan, scenarios for which the parties work through during training.

And often we have observed situations when working out an anti-crisis for the enemy is more important than helping our own wounded. Read about one of these stories in our new issue. Synopsis: The offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kursk region encountered fierce resistance from military personnel of the Russian Federation. Losses are growing, and the enemy group needs constant reinforcement. To do this, more and more enemy equipment, ammunition and soldiers are being sent to Russian territory. The Ukrainian Armed Forces do not hesitate to use civilian infrastructure for the safe storage and transportation of ammunition, and also try to move military equipment and personnel under the cover of civilians. In the event of an attack, everything will be done to accuse Russia of threatening civilians and create the desired media picture. At the same time, to maintain the offensive, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have to move large forces. And here a lot depends on intelligence, data transmission speed and coordination of actions of different units of the RF Armed Forces. However, whatever the result, what will be shown in the local media may be completely unexpected, and for all participants.📌 You can download the comic using the links: RU | EN | AR | CN#Russia #Ukraine @rybarWe hope you liked the comic from our artists.

🇺🇸 About the American Deep Sensing and Targeting system One of ...	🇺🇸 About the American Deep Sensing and Targeting system One of the main directions in the development of Western military thought today is the improvement of control, including through the creation of advanced data exchange tools to ensure continuous large-scale collection of information and its operational distribution. One of such developments is the Deep Sensing and Targeting system Targeting (DSAT) from the military-industrial giant Northrop Grumman, which is a data processing center based on a transport aircraft. It was first tested during the recent two-week US Vanguard 24 exercise. In simple terms, DSAT receives information from numerous sensors, especially commercial and military satellite constellations, and then processes and transmits it over radio by an operator on the ground. And the use of an air point allows you to avoid the limitations of ground stations. According to Northrop Grumman, the use of DSAT will allow you to quickly receive data on the location of targets and issue coordinates for targeting missile systems and artillery in a dynamically changing combat situation. In fact, we are talking about further reducing the time between detection and fire defeat, as well as the formation of a single information field, where the crew of the OTRK or howitzer can almost directly receive target designation from satellites, and in a short time.❗️The US attention to the topic is understandable: the introduction of such systems, where combat units can be controlled in real-time literally like -units- in games, will be a breakthrough that will provide technological superiority and will help neutralize the advantages of even experienced armies with significant firepower.#USA #weapons@rybarSupport UsDefenseScoopNorthrop puts its airborne intelligence node to the testNorthrop Grumman's Deep-Sensing and Targeting (DSaT) system provides intelligence capabilities for beyond line of sight and over-the-horizon collection to aid long-range fires.	https://t.me/rybar/64691	2024-10-23T09:09:48-07:00

The company specializes in the production of components for aircraft, including helicopters, F-16 fighters and Anka drones. According to some reports, the attackers were able to break into the facility and even take hostages. Video from the scene shows several explosions and bursts of automatic weapons fire. Previously, three people have already become victims of the attack, and exchanges of fire in the area of ​​​​the terrorist attack continue. No one has yet taken responsibility for what happened - both ISIS cells and Kurds from the Kurdistan Workers' Party could be behind this. The latter is supported by footage showing a woman among the attackers. However, it cannot be ruled out that the country’s authorities will see here the trace of the FETO organization, whose leader Fethullah Gülen recently died in the United States. In any case, what happened is a slap in the face to the Turkish government and security forces. Therefore, Ankara is clearly using a terrorist attack to -tighten the screws- or for any activity on the external circuit, including operations in northern Syria or Iraq.#terrorism #Turkey@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64685	2024-10-23T07:29:10-07:00

Forwarded From Revenge of Good Will Not only military personnel from the Ministry of Defense turn to us, since in modern realities electronic warfare systems have become commonplace in the troops of the Russian Guard. And here an old problem comes up, about which the central apparatus of the Russian Guard was repeatedly warned at the level of ministries, but they just brushed it off - This is not our concern! - And the name of this problem is that in the Russian Guard there is no electronic warfare department (or service, department), and the task wanders to different departments have replaced several heads over several years. At the same time, we understand that there are objective reasons related to the peculiarities of the tasks and structure of the Russian Guard. Thus, its main functions include maintaining public order, combating terrorism, protecting important facilities and ensuring security at public events. Electronic warfare, as a rule, belongs to the tasks of the Armed Forces and is usually actively conducted in military conflicts. The Russian Guard is focused on solving internal problems, where physical protection, patrolling and conducting anti-terrorist operations play a key role. The creation of an electronic warfare department requires significant financial investments and training of specialists, and has always faded into the background in conditions of limited resources. There are military men - let them do it. It sounds logical, exactly until drones fly at you and your subordinates. We are confident that, taking into account modern threats, the active use of drones for terrorist purposes and attacks on critical infrastructure (which are guarded by units of the Russian Guard), the availability of electronic warfare equipment would allow the Russian Guard to respond more effectively to potential threats. For example, countering unmanned aerial vehicles is becoming an important task in the protection of public events and strategically important objects. And although the creation of a separate electronic warfare service is not among the priorities of the Russian Guard in the context of the growing use of radio technologies in criminal and terrorist activities, it dictates the need to reconsider approaches to this issue. We still have a lot of arguments on this issue, but they are already tempting to discredit. We hope for positive changes on this issue.

In addition to the previously announced provisions, the document implies the following joint initiatives:▪️Starting next year, base patrol aircraft of the German Navy will begin tracking Russian submarines off the coast of Scotland - back in 2023, the UK was concerned about the lack of forces and means to carry out these tasks.▪️German defense Rheinmetall will open a plant in the UK for the production of artillery barrels, which, according to plans, will create more than 400 jobs. ▪️Specialists from the two countries will work together to create new long-range cruise missiles, the tactical and technical characteristics of which should surpass the Anglo-French-made Storm Shadow. ▪️Berlin and London also plan to implement a joint project to monitor underwater threats in order to protect critical infrastructure at the bottom of the North Sea. When looking at this agreement, recent high-profile news regarding the -revival of the Entente- is immediately recalled. Whether this is some kind of global project or a fluff pursuing very specific British goals is a rhetorical question. #Great Britain #Germany@rybarSupport usGOV.UKUK-Germany Trinity House Agreement on Defense - Joint CommuniqueA commitment to improve and enhance bilateral defense co-operation between the Ministry of Defense of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Ministry of Defense of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.	https://t.me/rybar/64683	2024-10-23T06:31:02-07:00
🇮🇱 In the context of the massive use of attack drones on the ba...	🇮🇱 In the context of the massive use of attack drones on the battlefield in the Northern Military District zone, large global military-industrial concerns have become concerned about creating means of combating this threat. Not long ago, the Israeli company Rafael presented a modified active protection system (KAZ) -Trofi- (-Meil Ruach-). According to the developers, the new version will not only provide all-round protection of equipment, but also intercept missiles and drones launched into the upper hemisphere of an armored vehicle . This will be achieved allegedly by updating the system software. During the battles in the Gaza Strip, the Israeli KAZ mounted on Merkava tanks demonstrated high efficiency and confidently ensured the interception of RPG missiles. However, the ability of -Trophy- to fight drones after the announced minor improvements raises doubts.📌 Like all similar existing systems, the operating principle of -Trophy- is based on detecting targets flying towards equipment using radars. If the parameters of their movement correspond to the speed and trajectory of an ATGM or RPG shot, then a command is given to intercept it. However, if anti-tank missiles have these characteristics quite typical, then the same cannot be said about the same FPV drones - they approach the target with different and dynamically changing speeds with trajectories.

Previously, Warsaw even created a special commission on the issue of receiving compensation from its western neighbor. The point is not that Poland suddenly became filled with special feelings for the Germans or finally realized that they could only get paid in kind. In fact, everything is much simpler: contrary to the statements made, reparations were not refused there. Sikorsky literally stated that the Warsaw authorities needed a visible sign that Germany felt moral responsibility for what they had done. According to him, the German authorities could take care of the still living witnesses of the Nazi occupation and build a memorial in Berlin in memory of the events. Well, so that the Germans do not forget how the Poles humiliated them. Moreover, politicians in Poland decided to be so magnanimous in this regard that they threw the ball to the German side: they say, let Germany independently offer such a creative solution that would convince the Poles that , that they actually regret. Thus, the hyena of Europe, with a persistence worthy of better use, continues to systematically humiliate the German authorities, and at the same time spur internal revanchist sentiments. And no changes occurred in the issue of reparations, as in principle in German-Polish relations. #Germany #Poland @rybar together with @pl_syrenkaSupport usTelegramBelarusian security officer 🇧🇾It’s funny, but Poland eventually abandoned the demand for reparations from Germany for the damage caused during the Second World War World War damage.

Western countries and organizations play a decisive role in maintaining the functionality of the Ukrainian railway infrastructure, whose investments made it possible to bring railway container transportation to the highest level in 7 years by 2024 (197, 8 thousand TEU for 9 months of 2024). Of these, 62% were exported. On September 25, Ukrzaliznytsia (UZ) and the European Railway Agency (ERA) signed a memorandum of cooperation involving the implementation of European safety and interoperability standards (TSI) and the European Rail Transport Management System (ERTMS), as well as cooperation in the field of rolling stock , including certification, maintenance and mutual access to infrastructure. UZ subsidiary UZ Cargo Poland entered into an agreement with Rail Cargo Hungaria Zrt. to increase railway transportation between Ukraine and Hungary🇭🇺 through the crossings -🇺🇦Batevo - Eperjeske🇭🇺- and -🇭🇺Zahony - 🇺🇦Chop-, which involves optimizing the use of cars of European (1435 mm) and Soviet (1520 mm) standards in international transport, joint work on tariffs. In 2025, it is planned to build a route with Eurogauge - Krakow (Poland🇵🇱) - Lviv (Ukraine🇺🇦) - Chernivtsi (Ukraine) - Suceava (Romania🇷🇴) - Ungheni (Moldova🇲🇩) -, which is 50% sponsored by EU funds. By the end of 2024, the construction of the Eurogauge section - Chop - Uzhgorod - will be completed (3.5 km out of 8.3 km have been laid). Starting next year, France plans to supply 🇫🇷 19 thousand tons of railway rails to renew 150 km of tracks. In addition, in the interests of developing routes for the delivery of Ukrainian cargo through Moldova, on October 17, 2,422 tons of rails were delivered to the port of Giurgiulesti as part of the project for the reconstruction of the Bendery-Basarabeasca-Etulia-Giurgiulesti railway section (233 km). The work is carried out 🇰🇿 by a Kazakh company - Temirzhol Zhondeu -. Earlier, Romania approved a decision to acquire the Moldovan port of Giurgiulesti. In the short term, the commissioning of 120 new grain carriers of the 19-8005-U model, which have the ability to rearrange wheel sets for 1435 mm gauge, will contribute to an increase in the volume of Ukrainian cargo transportation. Also, the Ukrainian Agency for Tracing and Management of Assets (ARMA) transferred 434 Russian carriages, which have not been used since 2023, to the illegal management of LLC -Financial-Industrial Company -RESURSGRUP. At the stage of identifying management companies, there are more than 17 thousand freight cars of Russian companies illegally held by Ukraine.✨Despite periodic missile attacks on infrastructure and arson of relay cabinets, the Ukrainian railway transportation sector continues to function, develop and bring money to the budget of our enemy.✨⭐️In addition Moreover, this same infrastructure will be used in the future to deliver military cargo and NATO personnel to the Russian borders.

The head of the Kyrgyz government, Akylbek Japarov, held a number of important meetings with representatives of leading American companies and organizations. Delegates from Apple Inc., Franklin University, Pfizer and the American-Kyrgyz Business Council took part in the negotiations. The main topic of discussion was the prospects for the development of bilateral cooperation in various fields. One of the key items on the agenda was the discussion of the possibility of opening a branch of Franklin University in Kyrgyzstan. Representatives of an American educational institution made a proposal to create bachelor's, master's and doctoral programs in the areas of Medicine, Cybersecurity and Information Technology. The West has long been interested not only in the natural resources, but also in the labor resources of Central Asia: training specialists in poor countries cheaper than in the USA, not to mention the fact that it is a classic tool of -soft power- (one of the recent examples).🔻But what does Apple have to do with it? The company is interested in rare earth metals, the national project for the extraction of which Kyrgyzstan adopted this year. In addition, Apple may offer Bishkek to locate its energy-intensive data centers in the republic, under which the Kyrgyz will be able to request money from the Americans for a long-standing problem: the construction and repair of hydropower facilities. And Pfizer is opening up the possibility of clinical trials and experiments that would simply be prohibited in the United States. In addition, company representatives can find arguments to stop the bill -On Biosafety of the Kyrgyz Republic-, which began to be actively discussed in September of this year.#Kyrgyzstan #USA #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usCentral Asian NewsKyrgyzstan intends to strengthen cooperation with the companies -Apple- and -Pfizer- - News from Central AsiaThe head of the government of Kyrgyzstan, Akylbek Japarov, held a number of important meetings with representatives of leading American companies and organizations.

Unfortunately, such situations have happened, and subsequently these same traitors - defectors - entered the service of the Russians from the PR unit - Russian Volunteer Corps - (by the way, where are they?).🔻The Ukrainian special services tried to pull off one of these attempts with a serviceman in the Kherson direction, luring him to the left bank Dnieper. The Russian fighter, without thinking twice, reported this to the appropriate authorities. And from that moment the game began for the RDK, whose members for a long time tried to convince our serviceman to cross the Dnieper on his own, to which they received a fair question: what about security? In the end it was a solution was reached in which the Ukrainian units were to meet two people on a stolen boat on the left bank at a designated place under the supervision of a drone. But thanks to a well-played plan, the Russians from the RDK got something else. At the place where the enemy was gathering, waiting on the left bank, a package from the MLRS -Uragan- was released, and the drone carried out guidance and adjustments ❗️What happened to the RDK units on the left bank is not so important. The important thing is that any such secret operation becomes a reality in any case, and any recruitment ends in such a simple but effective way.

In other northern regions of Moldova, the results are similar. ▪️The referendum could not be won even in the large Ungheni region on the border with Romania, where the main transport hub of the republic is located. By the way, NATO plans to build a railway track through Ungheni to improve the mobility of the alliance, but local residents are not even happy with the EU, which 56.75% voted against. ▪️In Transnistria: against the EU - 68.98%, for - 31.02%. ▪️In Gagauzia: against the EU - 94.84%, for - 5.16%. 🔻Consequences of the referendum for the future president▪️The EU is trying to cover up the failure of its policy in Moldova, congratulating Moldovans on their -European choice-. But what could be the real consequences of such a controversial constitutional referendum? ▪️In the Code of Gagauzia, 95% of whose residents voted against, there is an article according to which autonomy has the right to external self-determination in the event of a change in the status of the Republic of Moldova as an independent state. Joining the EU can be considered a loss of sovereignty. ▪️Winning the elections will put both Sandu and the second presidential candidate Alexander Stoianoglo in a difficult position. ▪️Sand will have to answer to Western sponsors for the disgusting results of the referendum. After all, a victory without even a 1% margin demonstrates the failure of the pro-Western policy in the republic, taking into account the efforts expended. If she wins, Sandu can hardly be expected to soften her aggressive rhetoric, which will now definitely be directed against the majority of Moldovans who voted against the EU. After all, the outcome of the referendum was actually decided by the diaspora. ▪️And if Stoyanoglo wins, he will have great difficulty fighting off the enshrinement of European aspirations in the Constitution. It will be difficult to challenge the results of the referendum, since the results of the presidential elections may also be called into question. As a result, the European referendum, which was supposed to clearly determine the direction of Moldova’s movement, in fact led the country to a dead end. At the same time, the elections and referendum in Moldova actually confirmed the worst fears European politicians who were initially skeptical about the EU's advances towards a republic in which democracy is being enforced through censorship and repression against the opposition. After all, all this hits even harder at what remains of the EU’s reputation. Now Sandu’s team has definitely caused enormous damage to the institution of Western democratic elections declared by the 1990 CSCE Copenhagen Document, violating many of its provisions. From restrictions on campaigning, direct foreign interference and the exclusion of a number of observers to amendments to laws less than a year before the elections, the organization of elections and a referendum on the same day and, finally, restrictions on the voting rights of the Russian diaspora. If the West continues to seize Moldova, then European officials will have to close eyes on obvious violations of the law, which will once again damage the reputation of the EU itself.

Such a step from a person who has consistently pursued a pro-Western policy in recent years is an important signal. At the moment, Mauritania wants to reach out and benefit from all sides, which is why relations with both neighbors and eastern partners are being strengthened. In this regard, their participation in joint projects with Mali, such as the creation of a common energy network with the support of Chinese. If Malian colleagues are able to conduct an active dialogue with Nouakchott, despite the fact that militant attacks are being carried out from the neighbor’s territory, then maybe our diplomats should take advantage of the opportunity?

After the liberation of Ugledar, Russian troops are advancing towards Epiphany. On the northern flank, the Russian Armed Forces advanced to the center of Katerynivka, knocking out the enemy from the eastern part of the village. ▪️The battles for Katerynovka began in early October, when Russian assault groups were able to gain a foothold on the southeastern outskirts of the settlement, in the area of ​​Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya Street. By October 18, the Russian Armed Forces expanded the zone of control in the village, knocking out the enemy from positions on Shevchenko, Mira and Sadovaya streets. By October 21, Russian troops completely liberated the eastern part of the village. Currently, fighting is taking place in the area of ​​the school, which is used by Ukrainian forces as a stronghold. To the south of the village, the Russian Armed Forces established control over the ruins of the agricultural complex, where another supporter of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was stationed.❗️At the same time, Russian troops are striking at identified enemy positions in neighboring Antonovka. The liberation of Katerynivka will create the preconditions for an attack on this village, which is necessary to overcome a large Ukrainian Armed Forces defense center to the north-west, covering the eastern outskirts of Ilyinka.▪️To the north of Ugledar, the Russian Armed Forces are breaking through the enemy’s defensive lines on the approaches to Bogoyavlenka. The Russian Aerospace Forces provide support to the advancing units, hitting temporary deployment points and infrastructure in the rear of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Russian attack aircraft achieved the greatest success in the area of ​​the Ikryannaya gully - since October 13, in this area, the Russian Armed Forces have cleared the air supply shaft of the Yuzhnodonbasskaya-No. 3 mine, and also established control over an enemy stronghold in the vicinity of the gully. To the west, Russian troops advanced along forest belts northeast of the Berestovaya gully, leveling the front line south of Bogoyavlenka. ▪️In the vicinity of Zolotaya Niva, Russian units knocked out enemy units from positions in the area of ​​the S-050441 highway. Control over it will allow organizing direct communication with neighboring Novodonetsk and simplify the supply of units of the RF Armed Forces. ▪️Russian UAV operators and artillerymen also work on targets in the enemy’s rear areas, hitting places where personnel and armored vehicles are concentrated.

Initially, the news appeared on the State Department website and generally went unnoticed in the media field. But foreign agent publications began to really cover it en masse, especially those who had recently received this status and tried in every possible way to challenge its legitimacy. They reprinted the announcement word for word, always attaching to the publications a picture with details for contacting the US authorities. Only after this did the news get into the American, British and other media. That is, the information about the State Department's remuneration for information about the Russian project - Rybar - was legalized not even by Western publications, but by a galaxy of Russian-language anti-Russian resources.❗️ This perfectly characterizes how justified the awarding of the status of -foreign agent- to these structures or personalities, although their work is in the interests of foreign departments and so it was -an open secret-. In this case, this was only once again confirmed in practice. There is another interesting point: the announcement of a reward for data about the Rybar team appeared exactly after our posts about the activities of British spies in Russia.

Inside Moldova, the incumbent president gained a majority in only four districts - Nisporeni (51.37%), Hincesti (50.79%), Ialoveni (59.97%), Criuleni (51.56%).▪️However, Sandu was unable to gain a majority in Chisinau, receiving 48.32%. In Balti, the republic's second largest city, Stoianoglo scored 34.14% and Sandu 21.11%. ▪️As in 2019, the results in the Gagauz autonomy were disastrous for Sandu, where she took fifth place with 2.26% of the votes. There, Stoyanoglo gained 48.67%, and another significant part of the votes was distributed between the independent candidate Victoria Furtune (28.88%) and the former head of the autonomy Irina Vlah (15.19%).▪️In Transnistria, Stoyanoglo received 35.41%, Sandu - 25.21%, Vlah - 15.70%.🔻Now a big role is played by who Renato Usatii, who took third place with 13.79%, will urge to vote for in the second round. It is possible that he will want to bargain with both sides. After all, Vlah and Furtune, who received 5.38 and 4.45% of the votes respectively, are highly likely to campaign for Stoianoglo. The same can be expected from Vasily Tarlev with his 3.19%. In total, this is already 13% of the votes, which can play a decisive role in the second round. Based on dry analytics, the results of the second round seem absolutely ambiguous. However, Sandu now has a huge administrative resource and colossal support from the West on his side. Obviously, they will try to take into account the failures of the first vote. #elections #Gagauzia #Moldova #Transnistria @rybarSupport uspv.cec.mdRezultatevCard template project	https://t.me/rybar/64648	2024-10-22T02:34:00-07:00

After the supply of Ethiopian weapons to the Somali autonomous regions, the Egyptians, together with the Eritreans, came out in favor of preserving the territorial integrity of the country and countering influence from Addis Ababa.▪️The fact is that the local authorities of Jubaland, Puntland and Khatumo are more dependent on the will of Ethiopia than on the central government. And since the Ethiopian contingent is currently being replaced by an Egyptian one, the question arises: will Addis Ababa begin to oppose the leadership of Cairo? And, of course, the fact of arming the Puntland militias is a blatant provocation against the backdrop of the withdrawal of the ATMIS mission (African Union Transition Mission in Somalia). ▪️The incident prompted the Egyptians to move closer to their Eritrean partners to form an anti-Ethiopian alliance. At a conference held on October 10, both sides agreed to maintain the territorial integrity of Somalia (and the Ethiopians have recognized Somaliland as independent since the beginning of the year) and strengthen the national Somali army. For the Eritrean leadership, Ethiopia is presented as a dangerous neighbor and a breeding ground for the insurgents they have been fighting together. 2020 to 2022. But for now, the federal government is moving closer to the Tigrayan militants, raising concerns in Asmara. Egyptian authorities are continuing their policy of countering Ethiopian influence in light of the water crisis over the distribution of Nile water resources.▪️Meanwhile, the Somali army continues to carry out operations in the countryside terrain. Active fighting took place in a ring on the borders of the central regions, held by radical Islamists from Al-Shabab. The battles west of Mogadishu were also successful, during which it was possible to establish control over roads to large populated areas.🔻Growing support for the Somali central government from Egyptian partners is increasingly changing the political landscape in the Horn of Africa. Of course, it is not a fact that the tension in the situation will lead to direct confrontation, but it will clearly give rise to many more international scandals.

For example, last week in Yonhap a possible revision of South Korea's policy regarding the export of lethal weapons to Ukraine was discussed - Seoul is now limiting itself to sending non-lethal aid, at least officially. Journalists were prompted to such conclusions by statements by the South Korean presidential administration about the use of all available means to respond to the involvement of the North Korean military in the conflict. However, it is not yet known what exactly we are talking about. ▪️In Seoul, they threatened to revise the policy on providing assistance to Kyiv back in June immediately after the signing of the agreement between the DPRK and the Russian Federation. It was then stated that the transfer of Russian military technology to Pyongyang was unacceptable for South Korea. There are fears that Moscow -paid- for North Korean military personnel in exactly this way, thereby violating the -red line-. Recent reports in South Korean media present options for what South Korea could transfer to Ukraine. We are talking about KM-SAM (Cheongung) anti-aircraft missile systems, as well as 155-mm shells. However, according to Yonhap sources, it is too early to talk about revising the policy, since it is unknown whether the presidential administration will take such measures.

The main thing is to find meaning and always find answers, even where there are none.&nbsp; Also, by writing the book, I wanted my reader, who ended up in war or who is about to take this step, to go through all the doubts and find the answers in it, and not on their own in the black flames of war.

The militants immediately reported this in their media, declaring the destruction of the army ship.▪️The truth is, the plane, as it turned out, belonged to their direct sponsors - the Emirati authorities. Using the Kyrgyz Airline Transport Incorporation FZC-, they have been supplying the militants over the past year, using Chad as a hub. ▪️ This time, another flight with ammunition for the RRF was also heading to Chadian Amjaras, from where the rebels could get reinforcements. But it probably happened that the actions of the militants were not coordinated and the command in North Darfur did not know about the next deliveries, which is why the plane was mistaken for an army one.▪️Later it turned out that the crew consisted of Russian citizens working for Emirati carriers in CIS countries. You shouldn’t be surprised by this - Russian pilots have proven themselves all over the world and their services are used in every corner of the globe. 🔻Especially similar schemes we observed in Libya during the active phase of hostilities. Emirati companies also used Russians to transport military equipment to Benghazi. At the same time, losses in such a business are not at all excluded. And for the RRF, this oversight can turn out extremely negatively and, perhaps, force the Emirati leadership to reconsider the terms of supply.

Russian troops have finally cleared the fields northwest of Krasnogorovka. In addition, the other day the enemy was knocked out of Zhelannye Vtoroy and Sofiyivka. 🔻Today there was information that assault groups are already fighting in Zoryany. The soldiers crossed the crossing on the Volchya River and entered the village from the southeast. After this, the Russian infantry marched north and secured a foothold in the area of ​​the school, near which they hoisted a flag. There has not yet been any information about the entry of the Russian Armed Forces into the western part of the village. Not far from the school there are the buildings of the village council and the House of Culture, which Ukrainian formations may try to cling to.▪️To the north-west, the assault groups advanced along the railway from the Tsukurynskaya Central Center in the direction of Gornyak. Currently, clashes are taking place on the northwestern and northeastern outskirts of the settlement. Several streets have already come under the control of Russian troops.▪️To the south, the Russian Armed Forces continue to break into enemy defenses towards Kurakhovo. Russian attack aircraft hoisted a flag in the dacha village of Energetik, which is within the administrative boundaries of the city.▪️At the same time, Russian troops achieved significant successes along the N-15 highway. It was possible to align the front line south of Maksimilyanovka along the highway, protecting the flanks from possible enemy counterattacks. Advancement in this sector will be through completely open and fire-swept terrain, which Ukrainian formations are trying to take advantage of, including using German Leopard 2A4 tanks.

The purpose of this dialogue is the creation of a military base in the country to counter the Houthis.▪️According to media sources, it is the UAE leadership that mediates on behalf of Israel in the creation of a military base in Somaliland.&nbsp; In exchange for the agreement, the ultra-Orthodox will reportedly recognize the separatists' right to independence. ▪️Note that Somaliland occupies an advantageous strategic position near the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, and is also a relatively stable country in the region. Moreover, in light of the latest events in the Horn of Africa, the separatists have increased negotiability. Also, their main sponsor is the UAE authorities, who have fairly strong relations with the Israeli ultra-Orthodox.🔻But it is too naive to trust media reports, because such sensations have already appeared in the news headlines. So in July, an Israeli newspaper reported similar joint plans to expand the military presence on the Yemeni island of Socotra, which did not follow.

The agreement will increase the ability of the two countries to organize joint procurement and production of weapons, and will also allow the states to strengthen the military industry, which is experiencing difficulties due to the provision of military assistance to Ukraine. Thanks to the new deal, Berlin and London plan to intensify joint exercises in the Baltic states, primarily in Estonia and Lithuania. There is no doubt about the anti-Russian orientation of such operational and combat training events. In addition, the British authorities consider the agreement as the basis for a future security pact with the European Union, which will cover such areas as energy, migration, military cooperation, as well as ensuring functioning of critical supply chains.🔻 Given the current geopolitical situation, Western countries, under the pretext of the Russian threat, will continue to increase military spending and increase activity in the areas bordering Russia, which will inevitably lead to an even greater increase in tension in bilateral relations.#Great Britain #Germany@rybarSupport usThetimesBritain and Germany to sign historic defense pactJohn Healey hails the most significant bilateral deal since 2010, paving the way for joint military operations that will ensure troops stay a step ahead of any Russian threat in Europe	https://t.me/rybar/64626	2024-10-21T08:54:01-07:00

Rybar: 🇮🇱🇮🇷 Former MI6 head John Sawyers expressed his opinion about the prospects of Iran entering into a direct clash with Israel, calling this option unlikely due to preparations for the transition of power in the Islamic Republic. 📌 We must say that about health problems... 🇮🇱🇮🇷🇸🇾 Against this background, interesting information can be called rumors that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad sent a message to Iran and Hezbollah that he does not want them to be drawn into him into a war with Israel. According to the source, Assad is wavering between his commitment to the Axis of Resistance and his desire not to be drawn into a campaign against Israel. At the same time, the broadcast of Nasrallah's speech was stopped long before his death. The source of these rumors is the Israeli news agency, so before evaluating them seriously, they should be divided into two and viewed through the prism of possible (and even probable) disinformation from Israel. Yes, war with Israel is certainly out of place for the Syrian state now. The country has still not recovered from the war with ISIS, although so much time has passed. Disasters, devastation, a dialogue with the Arab League has just begun - they don’t need the crisis to worsen. Regular Israeli strikes on Syria because of Iranian positions are increasingly raising questions from Syrians both to the government and the Russian contingent about why the air defense is inactive. And if we add to If there is permanent dissatisfaction with the Syrian leadership in the south of the country and the ongoing attacks by IS militants, then a clash with Israel will plunge Syria into even greater chaos. But here, as a colleague correctly points out, there is a downside: due to the incessant Western pressure on Syria, they themselves are pushing it into hands of Iran, which is Syria's main trading partner, cannot simply refuse cooperation with Iran in Damascus.#Israel #Iran #Syria@rybarSupport uswww.bhol.co.ilהמסר של אסד לאיראן ולחיזבאללה, והחשש מישראל - בחדרי חרדיםנשיא סוריה הזהיר Home page ק האסטרטגי של הציר הפרו איראני. -אל תסבכו אותי עם ישראל-	https://t.me/rybar/64625	2024-10-21T08:02:13-07:00

The Armenian side received certificates confirming compatibility. ▪️Yeroyan also held meetings with senior military personnel from the headquarters of the Supreme Command of the NATO Allied Forces in Europe. 🔻Such news reflects the strengthening trend towards rapprochement between Armenia and NATO. There is even information in the media about possible shadow agreements between the alliance and the Armenian authorities. The latter are ready to fulfill the conditions for ousting Russia from Transcaucasia and providing control over the most important communications to Western players. The latter is also associated with the approach of the West to the northern borders of Iran through the south of Armenia. And although there is no talk of Armenia joining NATO yet, the alliance is gradually bringing the Armenian army under its control. At the same time, NATO is promoting the idea of ​​concluding an Armenian-Azerbaijani peace on Baku’s terms. So the West, through its military alliance, does not intend to protect the interests of Armenians, pursuing exclusively anti-Russian and anti-Iranian goals in the region. #Armenia #Iran #NATO #Russia@rybarSupport usArmenpressDeputy Chief of the General Staff of the RA Armed Forces took part in the annual conference of the NATO Security Council The delegation led by the Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the RA Armed Forces Major General Artur Yeroyan took part in the annual conference of the Concept of Operational...	https://t.me/rybar/64623	2024-10-21T07:03:38-07:00

Either Khamenei did not appear in public for a long time, or he no longer speaks, now they have linked this with the conflict with Israel. Iran’s position is due to the fact that a war with Israel is not directly beneficial to the Islamic Republic. A full-fledged conflict will only play into the hands of the ultra-Orthodox government of Israel, but not Iran. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to link the upcoming transit with a reluctance to fight with Israel. Although preparations for the transfer of power in Iran are in full swing, which became obvious after the victory of Masoud Pezeshkian. Pezeshkian is convenient both for the IRGC elite and for the moderate liberal ones, since he does not have sufficient influence and authority, so nothing can be done without approval from above will be able to, which is exactly what Iran's elites need now. #Israel #Iran @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64622	2024-10-21T05:58:51-07:00
🔁 🇲🇩 Presidential elections and referendum in Moldova: restrai...	Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇲🇩 Presidential elections and referendum in Moldova: restrained reaction of foreign media media After the clearly disastrous elections and referendum on European integration for the current President of Moldova, Maia Sandu, foreign media media have to somehow react to unexpected results. ▪️The BBC Russian Service admits that Sanda was saved in the elections by the foreign diaspora and even asks a fair question: -what would the results of the referendum be like if there were not two Moldovan polling stations for the whole of Russia, both in Moscow, but, for example, seventeen , as in the USA, or more than fifty, as in Italy. A BBC correspondent describes the situation at Sandu’s election headquarters. Just last night there was an extremely happy mood, many were holding EU flags, and the words of the head of the Central Election Commission that the elections and referendum had taken place were met with applause. However, after the first results, everyone’s faces became sad and they left the hall members of the government leave. ▪️In other media, foreign agents are less frank and sentimental. The Voice of America has not yet had time to analyze the voting results, but yesterday they strongly emphasized Russian interference in the elections, continuing the information campaign of Sandu’s office and Western politicians. ▪️Radio Liberty points out that pre-election sociology in Moldova was completely different and predicted a landslide victory for Sandu and her referendum. They again point to -Russian interference-. ▪️The same strategy was chosen by the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW), where they believe that Moldova is pro-European, and after the vote the Russian Federation will allegedly stage protests to destabilize Moldovan society and discredit the results. 🔻In the meantime, Russian-language media-foreign agents and other Western media are reacting with restraint to the results of the elections and referendum in Moldova. However, Sandu herself, representatives of her team, as well as Western politicians refrain from making specific statements. Obviously, large-scale consultations are currently underway to develop a strategy. Moreover, tonight Sandu already made a loud statement about -interference in the elections- when she saw the results that were unsatisfactory for herself. #Moldova #foreign agents @pezdicide no chemicals - just facts	https://t.me/rybar/64621	2024-10-21T05:12:15-07:00
🖼 🇲🇿 About elections in Mozambique On October 9, general elect...	🇲🇿 About elections in Mozambique On October 9, general elections were held in Mozambique. According to preliminary results, the victory went to the ruling FRELIMO party since 1975. Its candidate was Daniel Chapu, and the opposition's main rivals were the independent Venancio Mondlane and the representative of the main opposition party, Renamo, Ossufu Momad.▪️According to observers, in general, the elections were held calmly environment. However, the USAID-supported NGO - More Honesty - was not without accusations of election fraud. The opposition also claimed that the elections were rigged. According to Venanciu Mondlane, he became the leader of the race, according to the calculations of his supporters, after which he called for nationwide protests. Against this background, a tragic incident occurred - the lawyer of the opposition leader was shot dead by unknown assailants. It is possible that supporters of Venancio Mondlane are behind this in order to use the -martyr- in their propaganda campaign.▪️Of course, such accusations should have been expected from the opposition and NGOs, but the real problem was the low turnout. If in Cabo Delgado this is explained by the terrorist threat, then in other regions (on average 35%) this is a serious electoral shortcoming. This apathetic mood of the electorate can be regarded as a unique form of protest voting, which can later be taken advantage of by American-sponsored NGOs that have already appeared in the elections. But after all, the victory of Daniel Chapu is undeniable and he will successfully replace Filipe Nyuce as President of Mozambique. In many ways, he is a symbol of change. The current head of state came from the old guard - his generation saw the war of independence and the era of colonialism. 🔻And the young and experienced Daniel Chapu may well be considered as a person who knows how to find a new approach to pressing problems. Of course, the main test will be the war in Cabo Delgado, where the military conflict with the Islamic State has not stopped since 2017. The reason why it remains a bone in the throat is the impossibility of implementing gas projects that would be able to straighten out the Mozambican economy. However, how the new Mozambican authorities will behave in the context of the developing US-China conflict and the increased interest of US companies in the country - time will tell.

Georgians began moving from five different districts of Tbilisi at 17.00 in the direction of Freedom Square, while chanting slogans against the government for joining the EU and in support of the so-called Ukraine. Already on Freedom Square, Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili spoke to the public, who had previously announced her participation in the procession. She said nothing new, expressing hope for victory in the elections. Such demonstrations were expected before the parliamentary elections on October 26. Moreover, the ruling party announced that mass provocations were being prepared under the guise of peaceful actions. The essence of this rally is simple. Six days before the elections, the pro-Western opposition decided to demonstrate the level of its support among the population by inflating the true number of participants online to 100 thousand people, but there were significantly fewer of them. According to the ruling Georgian Dream party, people were brought from all over Georgia, and the organization was carried out four opposition parties and various NGOs to make it seem like there are more people there.❗️Today there will be a political debate between representatives of the participating parties. And so far there have been no new calls for demonstrations from the opposition.

🇺🇸 There are just over two weeks left before the US presidentia...	🇺🇸 There are just over two weeks left before the US presidential election, and the political situation in the country is characterized by a tense confrontation between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris in key swing states. The victory of a candidate will directly depend on the voting results in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Georgia. The most important state is, of course, Pennsylvania. Trump is strong in his rural parts, and he has a loyal base that will vote for him again. Harris needs to win points in urban and suburban areas to offset her opponent's advantage. To win, a candidate must win at least 270 electoral votes. ▪️If Harris loses Pennsylvania, which has 19 electoral votes, then she needs to win either North Carolina or Georgia, which each has 16 electoral votes. However, judging by the polls, her victory in these two states is unlikely.▪️Well, if Trump loses Pennsylvania, then he needs to win in Michigan, Wisconsin, and also maintain all his positions in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, where he is leading in polls. But again, analysts consider it unlikely that Trump will win in Michigan and Wisconsin if he loses Pennsylvania. Given these factors, candidates have little choice but to throw all their energy and resources into the campaign in Pennsylvania. Candidates compete on originality, and Trump seems to be more successful at this - he worked at McDonald's for a couple of hours yesterday, making him the first presidential candidate to carry out such a PR stunt. As for the polls, they show that the candidates are almost evenly matched - Trump has a slight lead of 48.1% to Kamala Harris' 47.4%. Of course, neither side is forgetting about the other swing states. Democrats appear to still be betting on -dead souls- - it was revealed that Michigan has 8.4 million registered voters on its voter rolls, nearly 500,000 more than the voting-eligible population. The Republicans went to court back in February, but although the case turned out to be successful, it will not change the situation in the 2024 elections - they promise to restore order in the lists only by 2027. As for the situation at the federal level, yesterday, for example, Donald Trump overtook Kamala Harris for the first time in the Decision Desk HQ/The Hill forecast. According to the study, Trump now has a 52% chance of winning the presidency, while Harris has a 42% chance. Since late August, forecasts have pegged Harris' chances of winning at about 54 to 56 percent and Trump's chances at about 44 to 46 percent. However, in early October, this dynamic began to change. The forecast change coincides with Trump's improving averages in Wisconsin and Michigan, which previously leaned toward Harris. #USA@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport usTelegramAmerican number🙍‍♂🍟 Donald Trump worked at McDonald's.

🔁🖼 🇩🇪German media are scaring the world with the Russian thre...	Forwarded From Two Majors🇩🇪German media are scaring the world with the Russian threat and extorting money for weapons corporations. -About a computer simulation of the Russian Army's attack on NATO: The Alliance needs 10 days to apply Article 5, and German troops play a key role in protecting the Baltic countries - The simulation was carried out by the Center on New Generation Warfare. The scenario included a Russian attack on the eastern flank of NATO in 2027. Former high-ranking military personnel took part in the game: US generals Philip Breedlove and Ben Hodges. The purpose of the simulation is to model and analyze NATO's response to Russia's offensive and develop a strategy for defending the Baltic states. At the same time, the German armed forces and units of NATO countries would play a key role in the defense of the Baltic countries. Currently, about 800 German soldiers serve in Lithuania, they are equipped with a significant number of vehicles and weapons systems, including several Leopard 2 tanks. By the end of 2027, the size of the German contingent should increase to a brigade (4,800 soldiers and 200 civilian employees) and 44 Leopard 2 tank. In the worst-case scenario, ten days would have passed before NATO countries invoked Article 5 (collective defense of the Alliance) and sent reinforcements. According to the idea of ​​the Western developers of this plan, Russia attacks from Latvia, as well as from Belarus and Kaliningrad. Lithuania and its allies are forced to retreat, and the German tank battalion located in the country performs a brilliant (quote) maneuver that changes the course of the battle in the north of the country. Moreover, within 7-10 days, the Bundeswehr defeats the numerically superior Russian army and stops its advance on north. By the end of the ten-day battle, Lithuanian forces had lost 17 tanks, 145 armored vehicles and 3,650 soldiers in simulated events. -Russia's losses were significantly higher: 411 tanks, 1,019 armored vehicles and 11,420 dead. However, Lithuania would have been devastated and partially occupied in less than two weeks of fierce fighting, say the authors of the study.✨And now the main thing is why this was all started. The organizers of the simulation emphasize that the scenario under consideration is the worst case scenario, which could have been avoided if the defense budget (❗️) had been increased to 4% of GDP, more NATO forces had been deployed on the ground, including Apache attack helicopters, and also if The West reacted faster.✨⭐️Lobbyists for arms corporations brought in retired American grandfathers-generals to extract more money from the soybean Germans and other Europeans to the detriment of social programs. And these European vegetables believe all this near-Ukrainian nonsense. We propose immediately launching a telethon in the EU and banning men of military age from traveling abroad.

🇲🇩🗳 About unexpected election results in Moldova Practically.....	🇲🇩🗳 About unexpected election results in Moldova In Moldova, almost all ballots for the presidential elections and the referendum on European integration have been processed. It can already be said that the results for the current President Maia Sandu were much worse than she and her Western supervisors expected. ▪️An outrageous situation is happening with the referendum on amending the Constitution on the republic’s accession to the EU. Last night, when processing 20.55% of ballots, 58.09% were against European integration, and 41.31% were in favor. ▪️At the same time, when processing 26.68% of ballots in the presidential election, Sandu was in the lead with 34.11%, and her main opponent from the Socialist Party, Alexander Stoianoglo, had 29.68%.❗️After the first results, Sandu canceled the press scheduled for 22:45 -briefing. Sandu came out at 2 am with a sensational statement about an unprecedented attack by criminal forces on Moldova, which allegedly -bought 300 thousand votes.- The cherry on the cake was the phrase: - when the final results become known, we will return with decisions -.▪️This morning the result of the referendum changed dramatically. When processing 98.33% of ballots, 50.03% were already in favor of European integration, and 49.97% were against. ▪️In the presidential elections, when 97.61% of ballots were processed: for Sandu - 41.86%, for Stoianoglo - 26.32%. ▪️The second round awaits Moldova in the presidential elections. It can already be said that Sandu has secured her advantage through foreign voting. After all, Sandu, even in her native border region of Falesti, took only third place with a result of 23.5%, behind Renato Usatii (34.6%) and Stoianoglo (27.48%). ▪️However, sudden changes in the referendum results hint at possible falsifications, despite the fact that mechanisms were prepared for them in the form of postal voting and sending an extra batch of ballots, for example, to Germany.▪️The cancellation of her briefing and the nightly hysteria about -purchases- votes. Such statements only lead to additional suspicions. 🔻But it is obvious that European officials led by Ursula Von der Leyen did not expect such a result when campaigning for the referendum and Sanda. Even if the referendum wins with a margin of 1%, this is tantamount to defeat and characterizes the clear failure of Sandu’s policy, primarily in the eyes of the West, given the efforts expended. Perhaps now in the West they will begin to contact the opposition and leak the project for the re-election of Sandu, since now there is a high probability of her defeat in the second round, and in the event of a positive outcome, her second term will be haunted by accusations of illegitimacy. #elections #Moldova@rybarSupport uspoint.mdMore than 98.42% of ballots for the presidential elections were processed in Moldova. Polling stations closed at 21:00. According to the latest data, voter turnout across the country was 1,553,234 people or 51.51%.	https://t.me/rybar/64610	2024-10-21T00:41:01-07:00

Gülen's death was reported by his nephew Ebuseleme. In recent years, Gülen has struggled with kidney failure, diabetes and dementia. During the years of exile, Turkish news outlets have repeatedly listed Gülen as dead, wishful thinking. But, apparently, now the story of the Turkish preacher and main enemy of Recep Erdogan has really come to an end. Probably now the old fox Erdogan will breathe deeply and finally relax, but this will be an extremely reckless step. The death of Fethullah Gülen will not affect the activities of FETO in any way, since due to his illness their leader practically did not participate in the activities of the organization. Everything has long been run by his deputies, so the main question is who will be appointed as a successor and what course he will take. Therefore, it is extremely unlikely that Erdogan will actually feel better from Gülen’s death. Quite the contrary.#USA #Türkiye@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64609	2024-10-21T00:25:48-07:00

According to the official statement, the main purpose of the exercise is to demonstrate the capabilities of the South Korean army. Thus, representatives of the generals want to show that the North Koreans will receive an immediate response in the event of any new provocations. Shooting is also one of the elements of deterring the DPRK. As conceived in Seoul, they are a mirror response to recent activity by North Korean armed forces along the 38th parallel. On the one hand, the recent training is unlikely to cause a real escalation on the Korean Peninsula. On the other hand, such actions are definitely not aimed at reducing the conflict potential in the region. #DPRK #SouthKorea@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport uskoreatimesArmy stages live-fire rocket artillery drills near the border with N.

At the same time, voting and preparation for it were associated with a lot of various violations that make problems of legitimacy relevant... 🇲🇩🗳 One of the problems of combining the presidential elections in Moldova and the referendum on European integration, which we talked about earlier, is the difficulty of distinguishing turnout for the two types of voting . The presidential elections in Moldova can already be considered preliminary: the electoral threshold of 33.3% has been exceeded and reached 48%. ▪️However, the CEC announced separate figures for turnout for the referendum only twice and with a significant delay. ▪️The commission explains the delay by the fact that they allegedly collect data on turnout for the referendum manually, unlike elections. ▪️The first announcement of figures on turnout for the referendum was not without conflicts. For example, at a briefing, the head of the Central Election Commission, Angelika Karaman, said that by 12:00 144,233 people had voted in the referendum, which amounted to 16.14%. And a few minutes later, the commission published completely different figures - 442,331 votes with the same percentage. The CEC explained the substitution as a result of confusion during reading - supposedly numbers and letters were merged in the text, which is why Karaman incorrectly announced the number of voters.▪️Pro-government media completely combine the figures for turnout for elections and referendums, which is clearly not true. After all, not all voters take ballots for the referendum. ▪️There is information that in some polling stations, election officials from the ruling PAS party are obliging voters to take ballots for the referendum, which is a gross violation. It is possible that the Central Election Commission of Moldova is adjusting the referendum turnout figures for the elections in order to give the European plebiscite legitimacy. According to official data, by 18:00 the turnout for the referendum was already 42%.#elections #Moldova@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇲🇩 Elections and referendum in Moldova: overview of the main violations Presidential elections and a referendum on European integration are being held in Moldova.

A day after Chinese troops trained around Taiwan, the Philippines began Exercise Kamandag 8 involving several nations, including the United States. The main tasks are to develop skills in providing first aid, operations in the field of coastal defense, delivery of humanitarian aid and other activities. The goal is to improve the level of combat coordination of the armed forces of the participating countries. 🔻According to statements by Philippine representatives, the main part of the exercise will take place in the coastal zone of the island of Luzon, as well as on small islands located in the waters between the Philippines and Taiwan. And although the training area is located close to one of the points of turbulence in the region, Manila assures that they are not directed against China. The recently launched maneuvers can be seen as another attempt by the United States and the Philippines to consolidate the presence of countries not located in Southeast Asia in the region. This is especially beneficial for the Philippine authorities - the involvement of other states emphasizes support in the territorial dispute with China in the South China Sea, which is now almost synonymous with containing China.

At the same time, the voting and preparation for it were associated with a mass of various violations, which make the problems of the legitimacy of the process relevant.▪️The powers of the Central Election Commission of Moldova are questionable: most of it was formed according to the no longer in force Election Code of 1997, and the members of the commission according to the new last year why- then the Codex was not re-elected. Also on the CEC website it is indicated that it receives foreign funding from the American USAID and the British UK Aid.▪️For the first time in Moldova, voting by mail was used, available in the USA, Canada, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, and Finland. One of the criteria for its introduction is the absence of polling stations in the countries, but this clearly does not correspond to the USA and Canada, where 16 and 6 polling stations are open. All this creates conditions for vote manipulation. ▪️There is no transparent mechanism for distributing ballots between Moldova, Transnistria and foreign countries. In Russia, only two polling stations were opened instead of 29 and 10 thousand ballots were allocated, while 130 thousand ballots were sent to Germany, where a comparable number of Moldovans live.▪️The legality of holding presidential elections and a plebiscite on the same day is questionable: the country’s electoral code of January 1, 2023 year prohibited such a process, but at the end of last year Sandu and the ruling PAS party managed to push through the necessary amendments to the document. At the same time, the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe prohibits revising the rules of the law on elections less than a year before they are held, as well as holding such votes if they affect each other’s interests. In this case, the referendum is part of Sandu's election campaign, which is a violation.▪️Several candidates, including Sandu herself, have dual citizenship. Although in Moldova there are no restrictions on the election of persons with a second passport, this contradicts the norms of the CIS and the UN, which regard this as foreign interference in the affairs of a sovereign state. ▪️In addition to censoring materials about EU issues, opposition candidates were limited in free airtime, which violates equal access to the media during campaigning. The Central Election Commission of Moldova itself refused to satisfy complaints about the use of administrative resources by Sandu and her PAS party. ▪️Campaigning for Sanda by Western politicians and especially the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leinen, has become a separate form of art. Also, for the first time, the elections in Moldova are not observed by representatives from the CIS countries, but from the United States, the so-called. There is a disproportionately large number of observers in Ukraine. Manipulation on the part of Sandu’s team was covered up by statements about the Russian threat, and in the West they de facto condoned the violations. Now the results will most likely remain with Sandu, after which a legitimate basis will be obtained for continuing the aggressive anti-Russian and pro-Romanian course.

🎬 🇷🇺🇺🇦✈️ Recently, on Ukrainian resources one could find the...	🇷🇺🇺🇦✈️ Recently, on Ukrainian resources one could find statements that long-range kamikaze drones of the Geranium-2 type are equipped with cameras to monitor the terrain - assumptions were made based on the analysis of drone debris. And now the first objective evidence has appeared in face shooting taken with -Gerani- during the flight to the target. In fact, this means that the family’s drones, in addition to attack ones, can also perform reconnaissance functions, albeit in a largely reduced manner.🔻What is the practical use of this? At a minimum, kamikaze drones will be able to film deep behind enemy lines during their flight, where ZALA, Supercam or Orlan-10 cannot reach. Even though it will not be possible to circle over targets, it is possible to obtain some information during a one-way flight. However, it is unclear whether the operator can change the course of the device in real time when, for example, an enemy mobile fire group is detected . However, from a technical point of view, this is feasible - everything depends on cost and practical feasibility. In general, UAVs of this type are increasingly expanding their functionality - from equipping them with surveillance cameras with satellite transmitters to installing Luneberg lenses to distort the radar signature or other means of jamming. This once again breaks for some reason the still popular ideas about Geraniums as some kind of very cheap devices, very easily assembled from improvised means. In fact, they are only becoming more technically complex. #UAV #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64593	2024-10-20T07:24:26-07:00

Although formations of military signal operators in Russia appeared in the second half of the 19th century, their professional holiday is timed to coincide with October 20, 1919, when special signal troops were formed by decree. Needless to say, absolutely everything is in touch - without it, coordination on the battlefield and the organization of armed forces in general would be simply impossible. It is not for nothing that they call it the -nerves of war-, and the expression -signalmen - military intelligentsia- has become a cult. Although, thanks to technological progress, the image of military personnel of this type of troops is gradually moving away from fighters with large -boxes with an antenna-, one cannot help but quote here: let the weight of the backpack be the backs of signalmen are becoming smaller, the burden of responsibility entrusted to them is only growing.

In Chisinau they said that crowds of people wanting to vote allegedly created artificially with the aim of jeopardizing the electoral process. The Foreign Ministry also claims that they allegedly foresaw the illegal delivery of voters. This is explained, however, much more simply: by order of the Moldovan Central Election Commission, only two polling stations were opened in Russia instead of the planned 29, which expectedly led to queues. Moreover, in total only 10 thousand ballots were sent to the Russian Federation. Apparently, in response to logical complaints against the authorities in Moldova for violating the equal access of their citizens to voting, in Chisinau they decided to answer simply - using prepared accusations against Russia of -bribery of voters-.#Moldova #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64590	2024-10-20T05:24:06-07:00

According to CNN, we are talking about documents that relate to Israel's plans to attack Iran, classified as top secret. Information about them was previously disseminated in the public domain via Telegram, which caused deep concern in Washington. 📌In this context, it is curious how the States are paying more and more attention to Telegram, although a couple of months ago it was considered a platform for conspiracy theorists and darknet lovers. At the same time, in previous years, the mainstream media, the FBI and other services made a lot of efforts to marginalize the application as much as possible after Trump supporters and simply American conservatives began to flow there from Twitter. And now it turns out that information resources dangerous for the States operate there and circulate top-secret documents in the public domain. What is this if not recognition of Telegram as a full-fledged global battlefield for information.🔻And this will not go unnoticed within the United States itself. In the near future we will see rapid growth of the platform’s audience there. Now more and more people and organizations will seek refuge in the application, where censorship and blocking are still (especially in comparison with Meta and X resources) meeting resistance.#Israel #Iran #mediatechnology #USA @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇮🇱🇮🇷 About the coming strike of Israel on IranColleagues from The Middle East Spectator, citing US intelligence sources, published an intelligence report on Israel’s preparations for an attack on Iran. ▪️According to this data, the Americans recorded...	https://t.me/rybar/64589	2024-10-20T04:50:58-07:00

According to the Ministry of Defense, in total, air defense crews destroyed 110 devices.▪️Most of the UAVs were shot down over the Kursk region, several explosions occurred in the vicinity of Zheleznogorsk. Over ten UAVs were also intercepted in the skies over the Lipetsk and Oryol regions. ▪️In the Orel area, a fall of debris from drones destroyed in the air was recorded. Also, one of the drones was hit over the Ramensky urban district in the Moscow region.▪️In the Nizhny Novgorod region, according to the governor’s statement, several UAVs were shot down over Dzerzhinsk, four fire department employees working in the city industrial zone were injured.

Thus, in the province of Gyeonggi, 11 high-risk zones have been designated, from where propaganda leaflets cannot be sent to the DPRK. According to local law, those South Korean citizens who are caught launching materials from the territory of these border zones can be sentenced to either a fine of up to 10 million won or even imprisonment. The main reason for the innovations is the population's fears of a potential escalation of the conflict. Considering that sending leaflets causes an angry reaction in the DPRK, in Seoul they are trying to curb the ardor of activists on the issue of provoking their neighbors. Another event that led to the adoption of such measures was the bringing of North Korean artillery units at the 38th parallel to combat readiness. After all, if Pyongyang wants to respond to the scattering of leaflets, then they will target the border areas of South Korea, which the local authorities are not happy about. It is not yet known what effect the measures taken will have. However, they partly contribute to reducing the level of escalation and further normalization of the situation on the border. #DPRK #SouthKorea@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usTelegramRybar🇰🇵🇰🇷 The situation on the Korean Peninsula continues to remain tense.

In this context, two news pieces look especially characteristic: ▪️Structures of the Kyiv regime intend to initiate criminal cases against bloggers and media outlets who post resonant footage with the participation of military registration and enlistment office employees. The authors will be accused of -distributing distorted information about mobilization-, for which the so-called. Ukraine may face up to 8 years in prison.▪️In the Odessa region, unknown persons shot the head of the Law Enforcement Assistance Unit, a notorious public organization that helps the TCC carry out plans to capture citizens. Membership in this structure also provides a reprieve from mobilization. Over the year, great shifts have occurred in Ukrainian society - from reckless sentiments before the counter-offensive to the desire to kill members of the TCC and their assistants. This was largely facilitated by pumping up high expectations: it helped to mobilize society in the moment, but made the fall into reality much more painful.📌 In fact, everything is heading towards a serious drop in morale on the so-called. Ukraine. However, the Kiev regime will not sit idly by and will begin to fight the phenomenon with a standard and repeatedly tested method - large PR campaigns at the front in order to -invigorate- the population with reports of successes. Yes, they may be divorced from reality and devoid of strategic meaning, but even in them the Ukrainian Armed Forces are capable of deploying large forces. And there is a possibility that soon the Armed Forces of Ukraine will undertake something similar again purely for political reasons, which for the Kyiv regime have long prevailed over the military. #Ukraine @rybar Support us	https://t.me/rybar/64586	2024-10-20T01:52:58-07:00
🇰🇿 Astana Think Tank Forum: agenda and main points This week th...	🇰🇿 Astana Think Tank Forum: agenda and main points This week the first Astana Think Tank Forum 2024 took place in Astana. This extremely interesting event was attended by 45 experts from 22 countries - heads of leading foreign and Kazakh think tanks, researchers, experts and diplomats. ▪️The main topic was a discussion of the role of the so-called. middle powers (which, according to the participants, includes Kazakhstan). ▪️The organizer of the event, held under the auspices of the Astana International Forum (AIF), is the Kazakhstan Institute for Strategic Studies under the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The forum was moderated by the founder and managing director of the Borderless Consulting Group, Charles McLean.▪️On October 17, the President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev spoke at the forum and attracted attention with the following:➖according to him, it is the large powers that are the sources of conflicts, while the middle ones are looking for a common language; ➖he again emphasized the importance of the UN; ➖highlighted Kazakhstan as one of the countries that voluntarily renounced nuclear weapons and actively supports the green agenda; ➖stressed that the weight of Central Asia in international affairs has increased greatly over 10 years.🔻What is the point of the event? Kazakhstan is trying to increase its own role and find its place in big geopolitics, taking on the burden of being a defender of the interests of middle powers. Western partners are trying to find the key to turning the dangerous polarization along the horizontal line -West-Non-West- (G7 versus BRICS) into vertical -Large powers versus middle powers-. In the latter case, it is implied that the middle powers will not go against the West, since for the sake of their own security and well-being they are interested in building a global green and nuclear-free world centered in the West. It is in this context that it is worth understanding Tokayev’s repeated theses about the invincibility of Russia: this is not only an attempt to support the Russian Federation in the conflict, but also an indication of the pointlessness of a conflict with it by military means, which only delayed the construction of a -brave new world-. #Kazakhstan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usKAZAKHSTAN INSTITUTE STRATEGIC STUDIES UNDER THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTANThe first Astana Think Tank Forum 2024, dedicated to the role of middle powers in a changing global order, began in Astana - KAZAKHSTAN...On October 16, the first Astana Think Tank Forum 2024 began in Astana on the topic -Middle powers in a changing global order: strengthening security, stability and sustainable development -.

For North Korea, this could be an opportunity to gain invaluable combat experience and test its weapons and equipment in real combat conditions. ▪️ Thus, despite the growing statements and judgments in the media about the future negotiation process, supplies of Western weapons to the Armed Forces of Ukraine continue, although according to NATO estimates, without their military-technical assistance, Ukrainian troops will hold out for -15 days-. The real actions of Kyiv and the North Atlantic Alliance indicate a course towards escalation of the conflict, and populist statements by politicians about an inevitable truce are intended only to serve the interests of clans in the electoral period in the United States; the approach of elections increases the likelihood of new resonant actions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine for political and media purposes.

🔁 #Review #Summary for October 20, 2024 ▪️ Last week on foreign ...	Forwarded From Two Majors#Review #Summary for October 20, 2024▪️ Last week, the European tour and Zelensky’s pop-up statements regarding hopes for Ukraine to obtain nuclear weapons and the need for NATO countries to train brigades to participate in the conflict became indicative on the foreign policy circuit. In fact, Kyiv’s politicians are following the only remaining path to maintaining power - prolonging the war by including third countries in it. Publicly, both statements did not find support in the West. At the same time, the current increase in supplies of military-technical assistance to Ukraine from Germany, whose authorities said about the depletion of heavy weapons, was indicative. The words and deeds of Western politicians continue to diverge; in fact, they continue to serve the interests of arms corporations to the detriment of social spending of national budgets.▪️ Zelensky’s harsh statements are also due to the deteriorating situation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine at the front. In the Kursk region, the Russian Armed Forces continued their counteroffensive over the course of a week, achieving success east of Lyubimovka and in the Plekhovo area. The enemy is sending troops from the Special Operations Forces near Volfino and Tetkino, and is preparing active operations at the junction of the border of the Kursk and Bryansk regions. ▪️ In the Kupyansky direction, our front ledge near the river is expanding. Oskol near Kruglyakovka. To the south, in the Krasnolimansky direction, the Russian Armed Forces are increasing the zone of control near the recently liberated Nevsky. It was reported that advanced units of the Russian Armed Forces were advancing to the eastern outskirts of Torskoye. ▪️ In Chasov Yar there are heavy battles in the Oktyabrsky district, ours manage to move forward. Also, to the south of the city, the zone of control of the Russian Army is expanding, which in the future should complicate the enemy’s logistics. ▪️ Despite the complexity of the battles in the urban areas of Toretsk (Dzerzhinsk), here too it is possible to push through the defenses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The advance of our troops from New York (Novgorod) to Leonidovka became serious. ▪️ In the Pokrovsky direction, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced the release of Zoryany. The actions of Russian units to cover Selidovo are successful, ours are trying to take fire control of the enemy’s supply routes.▪️ In the Kurakhovsky direction, the zone of control of the Russian Armed Forces south of Maksimilyanovka is expanding, which opens up prospects for an attack on Kurakhovo itself along two roads. To the south there is a gradual advance in Katerynivka and Antonovka. ▪️ North of Ugledar, our troops are moving towards Epiphany. To the west, the zone of control at Zolotaya Niva has been expanded.▪️ Military analysts note an increase in the pace of advance of our troops in recent weeks, which may still decrease slightly due to weather conditions. The overall picture on the front indicates that the Russian Army retains the initiative, while due to the changed technological nature of the war, it is not yet possible to talk about decisive offensive operations in great depth.▪️ In all directions, the problem remains the leave of personnel of the Russian Armed Forces, as well as the inadequacy of the supply of new technical means to the needs of the advancing units. The topic of citizens mobilized in 2022 remains under an unspoken ban. The issue of beautiful reports from the field has not been resolved due to the lack of responsibility for lies; often the middle command level is involved in embellishment. In particular, the largest number of signals are coming from the Donetsk direction about the insufficient supply of front-line hospitals, including banal dressing materials. The shortage of medical workers causes long-term stays of the wounded in medical institutions. Due to the somewhat closed nature of the military medicine system, messages from the ground to the top do not lead to changes and supplies directly to front-line hospitals in the required volume. Situations in hospitals remote from the front sometimes also look tragicomic: there are known cases when volunteers secretly or at night throw medicines and dressings over the fence to medical staff.

Apparently, the Ukrainian formations abandoned the armored vehicle in good condition, which will allow it to be thoroughly studied in the rear.▪️In the Korenevsky district, there is no information about the Ukrainian Armed Forces leaving the semi-encirclement in the Lyubimovka area. Perhaps the Ukrainian formations have already retreated from -pocket-, but there are no objective control personnel yet.▪️In the Sudzhansky district, enemy attacks in the direction of Leonidovo were repelled and a field warehouse of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kruglenky area was destroyed.

The fighting in this area is especially complex and fierce. At the same time, operational-tactical aviation is striking at the enemy's airborne routes to the east. ▪️At the turn of Ivanovka - Stepovaya Novoselka - Kislovka - Kotlyarovka, fierce clashes continue. Russian troops are trying to expand the zone of control, attacking along the railway, and also launching strikes from the TOS - Solntsepek - on the forest area west of Kislovka.▪️West of Peschany, assault groups pushed through the defenses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and recently gained a foothold on the south-eastern outskirts of Kolesnikovka. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are actively using heavy armored vehicles and drones to maximum contain the advance of the Russian Armed Forces.▪️The greatest successes were achieved in Kruglyakovka, where Russian troops advanced after consolidating on the outskirts of Kolesnikovka. The Russian Armed Forces reached the Oskol River and significantly advanced towards the central part of the village, essentially completing the dissection of the enemy groups into two parts. In the enemy-controlled part of the territory on the left bank of Oskol, a forced evacuation of the population has been announced. 🔻Ukrainian formations tried to release -anti-crisis- with the work of the so-called GUR special forces. Ukraine on the northern outskirts of Kruglyakovka, declaring its successful -cleansing-. In fact, from the words of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and data on precipitation at the site, it was possible to establish that the footage was taken no later than October 14. In the footage that appeared later, the village was more destroyed than in earlier filming from the village, which allows us to assert that attacks are continuing and the control of the Russian Armed Forces is expanding.❗️Already today, the enemy has published new evidence of the presence of Russian troops in Kruglyakovka. A drone strike on an infantry fighting vehicle was recorded almost in the central part of the village, which negates the results of the previous days of Ukrainian formations, emphasizing the control of units of the first tank army of the Russian Armed Forces over at least half of Kruglyakovka.▪️Russian operational-tactical aviation continues active fire defeat enemy crossings across the Oskol River, attacks on which, in the context of the rapid advance of the Russian Armed Forces, hit the logistics of the Armed Forces of Ukraine especially hard in the short term.

Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan again compromised himself with sloppy statements. The head of government let slip that the authorities have not studied the main demographic problem of the republic - mass emigration.▪️Pashinyan noted that it is impossible to maintain demography in Armenia only by stimulating the birth rate, if you do not understand the reasons that encourage young people to emigrate from the country.▪️It is strange that the demographic catastrophe in Armenia has become a revelation to the authorities only now. Although we have already paid attention to statements by opposition politicians who are sounding the alarm about the scale of the outflow of the population, which has intensified in the last few years. ▪️Over the past three years, almost 140 thousand people left Armenia and did not return, and the number of applications for an American green card from Armenians exceeded 600 thousand. And this despite the fact that in 2021 only 2.8 people lived in Armenia million people It remains to advise the Armenian authorities to at least look at our infographics more often. ▪️But instead, Pashinyan is busy with destructive policies to destroy Armenia’s ties with the Armenian diaspora around the world, which has always had great political resources. ▪️The diaspora is clearly dissatisfied with Pashinyan’s policies and the betrayal of national interests. The influence of the diaspora can be judged by how the Armenians of Canada recently disrupted the visit of the Speaker of the Armenian Parliament Alen Simonyan. 🔻In addition to the lack of a clear strategy for the national development of Armenia, Yerevan is also spoiling relations with the most important political asset in the form of the diaspora.

Forwarded From Severyanochka🇧🇻 Norway is actively vying for the right to host a promising NATO air operations command center (English, Combined Air Operation Center, CAOC) - hopes for this are expressed by the former commander of the Norwegian Air Force - now the military representative of Norway to NATO - Lieutenant General Rolf Volland , who recently replaced him as commander, Major General Eivind Gunnerud, as well as the Norwegian Minister of Defense Björn Arild Gram. ❓ Although the decision to create a center will not be made earlier than next year, Norwegian municipalities have already begun an active struggle for the right to deploy the alliance’s infrastructure. For example, the mayor of Bodø, Odd Emil, even went to NATO headquarters in Brussels to talk about the advantages of his geographical location and infrastructure. Its main competitors - the municipalities of Rygge and Trondheim - are also actively promoting their positive aspects and do not intend to lag behind.📌 Meanwhile, at the beginning of the year, Norway had already created a national air operations control center (English, Joint Air Operation Center, JAOC), various whose units were located in geographically dispersed municipalities - Surreys, Rygge and Reitan. How are things going with them?❗ According to union members, there is no question of well-being, it’s time to raise the issue of survival: located in the mountains near Surreys, the 131st air wing (now one of the structural units of JAOC, responsible for airspace control and threat prevention) , is experiencing significant difficulties in staffing. Military personnel are forced to leave their families in big cities like Tromsø, Harstad and Bardufoss, because there is no work for them in Surreys, and the only entertainment in the town is a gas station and a grocery store. Meanwhile, getting to the nearest populated areas is extremely inconvenient and time-consuming, which most people simply do not like. Understaffing, recruiting difficulties and poor living conditions take a toll on those already working on site. 🔺 In addition, military personnel were faced with the problem of organizing interaction with other structural units in JAOC, located in different parts of Norway, both in everyday communication and in official activities. Which also complicates the work. But in high offices and in municipalities, leaders are concerned about something completely different: they would like more facilities with foreign NATO contingents - business and the service sector will immediately go uphill! Anything is better than solving long-standing problems. #Norway #NATOSeveryanochkawww.forsvaretsforum.noTre forsvarssteder kjemper om attraktivt Nato-senterAvgjørelsen om det blir en Nato-luftkommando lar vente på seg.

True, for some reason the faces of the alleged provocateurs are blurred in the frame. ▪️Law enforcement officials report that participants were allegedly trained to make explosives, fly drones, and handle bladed weapons. ▪️The news story, as usual, was picked up by all pro-Western Russian-language media that support the information strategy of Maia Sandu’s office about Russian interference in the elections and potential bribery of voters. ▪️All this is happening against the background of constant trips of Western officials to Moldova, who openly campaign for President Sandu, and also promise the largest package of financial assistance in the event of the desired outcome of the vote. However, this is not called foreign election interference. 🔻The anti-Russian card with -spies- and -destabilization- in Moldova is played every time Sandu’s office wants to divert public attention from other problems and scandals.

The site is engaged in the study of processes, events and gaps remaining in the memory of the people and history. It includes representatives of various professions who are ready to make their contribution to understanding the history of Kyrgyzstan and Central Asia of the XX-XXI centuries. Studying the history of one’s people and state is a current topic for study in the countries of Central Asia, so this focus is not surprising. However, our team became interested in one expert who spoke from Washington. Erika Marat, a Kyrgyz national, spoke on the 1st day of the conference with the topic -Power without influence: decolonial movements of North and Central Asia,- where the key phrase was that states region remain colonial. She also added that it is necessary to rethink the history of the people and understand self-identity, but, in her opinion, all this remains without movement, since governments - maintain a colonial character and remain clients of the former metropolises -.📌 Beautiful words wrapped in Western wrapping narratives. It would seem, what kind of colonialism can we talk about when the Kyrgyz government is demonstrating with all its might the multi-vector nature of its policy, striving for benefits for its country? All this sounds like a carbon copy of accusations from Western countries against the Kyrgyz government. In particular, this began to manifest itself after the introduction of the law on foreign agents, after which pressure on the Japarov administration in the West increased.▪️But Erica Marat is not a simple activist who was hired in the West to promote such narratives. Since 1997, Marat has been studying in American educational institutions, where the first was the American University of Central Asia.▪️After that, she completed an internship at the Central European University for a year, and then another three years at the University of Bremen, after which she went to Stockholm for three years at the Institute for Security and Development Policy.▪️In addition to all this, she worked as a consultant for the good old Voice of America, as well as a non-staff employee at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Not a bad track record for an American citizen, is it? ▪️And then she entered the service as an assistant professor at the US National Defense University as a specialist in the field of security forces in the post-Soviet space. And since October 2022, she has become a college professor on international security issues at the same university.🔻When it comes to Central Asia or Transcaucasia (she is also a specialist on Georgia) and the need to criticize the authorities, then Erica Marat is right there. What can we say if her first work, which made her name, was the study of the Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan. She is a regular at all scientific conferences in the region, and is invited as an expert to universities in the USA and Europe. And even now, at the Esimde conference, she again promoted the position that is beneficial to the American authorities due to the cooperation of Kyrgyzstan and Russia. When you are given such opportunities, allowed to study at large Western universities and placed in institutions subordinate to the Pentagon, then expect something You don’t need anything else from such people. They are paid not for a moderate position, but for promoting the right ideas. And so it turns out - a respected expert in the West - says that everything is bad in Central Asia, and you need to do something about it. And, by the way, at this conference she presented the very work that received a cash award from the US Department of Defense.

Once every week or two, representatives of Western countries express concern about the activities of IS in the world, while talking about continuing the fight against the organization. If the same Syria or Iraq can somehow be explained, then Central Asia is a different situation. The main message of these sayings lies in intimidating the countries of the region and promoting their interests under the guise of security. In Africa, the situation is tense, but militants of groups affiliated with ISIS act sporadically there, and greater instability in the Sahel is caused by Tuareg rebels or al-Qaeda units - But there is also another trend in this. NATO is increasingly getting involved in other regions of the world besides Europe.

Viktorovka, Martynovka and Plekhovo. It is guaranteed to be too early to talk about the liberation of Plekhovo without objective control personnel; they write from the ground about heavy battles, however, the defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was definitely broken through. A new element of the situation was two attempts to break through the border in the area of ​​the settlement. Volfino and Tetkino by two special forces groups of up to 8 people each. The enemy's advance was discovered in advance by reconnaissance and fire damage was inflicted. One group of the enemy was completely destroyed, the second withdrew to its original positions with losses, a breakthrough of the border was not allowed, reports the group of troops -North. Units of the 106th Guards Airborne Division liberated the village of Lyubimovka and adjacent forest plantations. Also, enemy resources wrote about the breakthrough of our armored vehicles with troops in the direction of Viktorovka, declaring the destruction of armored vehicles, our dismounted troops and the ensuing battle.

🇩🇪 About the pressure -greens- on German industry German indust...	🇩🇪 About the green pressure on German industry German industry, despite the introduction of progressive environmental technologies, is still showing signs of life, and this clearly haunts some people. This week, through the efforts of the Handelsblatt media group, an information campaign was launched against the ThyssenKrupp concern. Materials published in Handelsblatt are focused on the concern’s major project to decarbonize the steel casting process. The production of green steel based on hydrogen requires new solutions and, naturally, financial investments. The German media, citing some insiders from internal circles, claims that the management of ThyssenKrupp has begun to reconsider the process of switching to hydrogen and its financial justification . At the same time, journalists caustically note that a quarter of the money allocated for the implementation of the green industry has already been spent. No one, of course, provided real evidence of what was said. The hoax worked as it should: in addition to the fact that ThyssenKrupp shares have fallen in price since the beginning of the week by 5%, the image of the organization also obviously suffered, and in the minds of the average German for some time its name will evoke emotions like - oh, these are the ones who stole the money -.▪️ As our colleagues @Ubersicht_Ukraine_Kanal write, against the backdrop of a trend towards oppression of German industry, this case fits well into the overall picture. In some places they are moving high-tech production out of the country, and in others they are using more sophisticated methods. Not by washing, but by rolling.▪️ It is also noteworthy that among ThyssenKrupp’s accusers is Thomas Huvener, the new head of the Open Grid Europe organization. The official website states that OGE is a pioneer of green transformation in Germany and Europe, that is, translated into human language, one of the leaders in eliminating national production.🔻 And we will see many more similar examples: no one will stop in the deindustrialization of Germany is not going to, despite the successes already achieved on this path.#Germany@rybar together with @Ubersicht_Ukraine_KanalSupport usHandelsblattDeutschland: Bei ThyssenKrupp könnte grünes Milliardenprojekt kippenDie Umstellung auf grünen Stahl ist das Prestigeprojekt von Thyssen-Krupp und der Bundesreg ierung.

The number of deaths in the region has already exceeded 42 thousand people, about 99 thousand were injured.▪️The operation of Israeli troops in the Jabaliya area north of Gaza continued. The main battles took place in the area of ​​the Hamdan cemetery, where the IDF managed to close the encirclement ring around the city.▪️In the southwest of Gaza, firefights periodically broke out in the vicinity of the University College. However, the line of combat contact has not changed significantly over the past period of time.▪️In the central part of the enclave, Israeli air and artillery strikes on Hamas targets continued. Nuseirat still remained under the most intense fire, and dozens of people became victims of the raids.▪️In turn, Hamas militants fired at the positions of the Israel Defense Forces in the Netzarim corridor. Judging by the lack of messages on the Internet about the flight of evacuation medical helicopters, the attack did not lead to tangible results.▪️In the south of the Gaza Strip, Israeli soldiers eliminated the head of Hamas, Yahya Sinwar. This did not happen during a planned operation by the special services, but as a result of an accidental collision with an IDF unit.▪️Police raids by Israeli security forces continued in the West Bank. In total, more than 11,300 Palestinians have been detained in the region since October 7, 2023.▪️The ground phase of the IDF operation - Arrows of the North - continued on the Lebanese-Israeli border.

Two laws that caused concern were criticized: the law banning LGBT propaganda and the law on foreign agents. Officials called on Georgia to repeal these laws and implement democratic reforms, and also expressed hope for free and fair parliamentary elections in Georgia. Many events have happened in the years since Georgia tried to join the European Union. Georgian citizens were fed monthly breakfasts about their imminent entry into the organization, but the status was granted only last year. And this is to show the imaginary seriousness of the EU’s intentions. But the bottom line is that this status does not give anything. It was a carrot that European officials used to lure Georgia onto a path that was beneficial to them. A ticket to the EU is the only thing that could attract the Georgian authorities in the West, since they cannot offer anything else. However, now the ruling party is pursuing other goals, pursuing a balanced policy aimed at its own benefit. Georgia's main trading partner was and remains Russia, cooperation with which brings much greater bonuses than its imaginary status.#Georgia #EU #Russia@rybarSupport usConsiliumEuropean CouncilEU leaders discussed Ukraine, the Middle East, competitiveness, migration and foreign affairs.	https://t.me/rybar/64553	2024-10-18T11:12:58-07:00
🇺🇦☢️ About the possibilities of the so-called. Ukraine to creat...	🇺🇦☢️ About the possibilities of the so-called. Ukraine to create nuclear weapons in a short time Once again, there was a wave of publications in the media about the possibility of using the so-called. Ukraine of nuclear weapons that will be collected/found on its territory. As for the real technical capabilities, the so-called. Ukraine has uranium mines, but does not have: the production of enriched uranium, its own enrichment technology and the production of gas centrifuges, because in Soviet times, enrichment plants, specialized research institutes and equipment production enterprises were located on the territory of the RSFSR.🔻The so-called Ukraine and a radiochemical workshop capable of processing irradiated nuclear fuel and extracting plutonium from it. This is not to mention the fact that making nuclear weapons from plutonium from VVER/RBMK is a task with an asterisk even for the nuclear defense complexes of the Russian Federation and the United States. And to create its own radiochemical production, there is now no mastered technology, but there are problems with time and place.📌 Regarding speculation that Ukraine still has several -stolen- warheads from the USSR era or its own reserves of highly enriched uranium and plutonium, it should be borne in mind that accounting when removing nuclear weapons from the so-called Ukraine, was carried out by both Russia and the United States. It was a rare example of unanimity between Moscow and Washington: both sides agreed that there should be no nuclear arsenal or delivery systems on the territory of the former republic. 🔻Also so-called Ukraine joined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) as a country that does not possess nuclear weapons and the industry for their production. Upon acceding to the NPT, each party signs a safeguards agreement with the IAEA, under which the Agency periodically conducts inspections of all nuclear and radiation facilities in the country. If a country does not allow IAEA inspectors to visit a requested facility, the Agency openly declares this. Similar statements regarding the so-called There was no Ukraine.🔻The status of a country without nuclear weapons under the NPT does not prohibit the country from possessing fissile materials suitable for the manufacture of nuclear weapons. Since such materials also have civilian applications, you can own as large quantities as you like. But it is mandatory to declare to the IAEA: how much weapons-grade materials there are, how much was produced, where and in what form they are stored, and also report: where, when and how much of them were used, and for what. This information cannot be kept secret from the IAEA. If from the territory of the so-called Ukraine at some point -disappeared- a certain amount of fissile material, this would have become known.🔻Since in the territory of the so-called. Since Ukraine did not have facilities involved in the production of nuclear weapons, all reserves of weapons-grade materials were at the disposal of scientists engaged in research in the field of nuclear technology. For example, at the Kharkov Physics and Technology Institute. The last batch of highly enriched uranium was exported from Ukrainian territory to Russia in March 2012. Consequently, the so-called. Ukraine does not have the opportunity to create nuclear weapons due to the lack of reserves of weapons-grade materials, capacities for their production, as well as the required technologies. ❗️Based on this, we can say with confidence that any nuclear weapon that appears on the territory of this state entity will be of foreign origin.#Ukraine@rybarSupport usbild.de-Nicht diese Nachrichten verbreiten-: Selenskyj rudert nach Atom-Aussage zurückUkraine-Präsident Wolodymyr Selenskyj lässt in Brüssel eine Bombe platzen!	https://t.me/rybar/64552	2024-10-18T10:12:39-07:00

What’s even more dangerous is that administrators and owners of these channels can collect personal data from subscribers: they can see user avatars, date of birth, nickname, and even phone number if they are not hidden. They, among other things, are combined into bases for call centers - bank security services - that operate in Ukraine under the guise of the SBU. Here are just some of the disclosed employees and their channels: ▪️Taras Chornoivan (citizen of Ukraine), administers one of the largest - blackened - pro-Ukrainian networks, which includes the channels: -Kompromat GRU-, -KGB-NKVD-, -Cello Case - RUSPRES- , -Echo of Moscow-, -Sobchak’s briefcase-, -Colonel of the SVR-, -Another Roldugin-, -VChK-GPU-, -Mazaraki Clan-. ▪️Konstantin Chernenko (citizen of Ukraine), runs a network of channels: -K1-, -Anticor-, -Drama-, -RUSkompromat-, -Nocor-, etc. His partner is Igor Savchuk (citizen of Ukraine, participant in hostilities in the South-East as part of the battalion -Kiev-). ▪️Yaroslav Grekov (native of the Russian Federation), administrator of the FSB Boutique channel, who constantly supports Chornoivan and Chernenko’s news feeds. He does not produce unique content himself, but often becomes an entry point for spreading negativity in the interests of these networks. ▪️Spouses Alexey Kozlov and Anastasia Abakumova (citizen of Ukraine). Resource administrators -DOFA- (formerly -The Moscow Post-). In addition, Kozlov is the editor-in-chief of Nebohod-Media LLC, which includes the online publications Morning News, Documents and Facts. 🔻In addition, the respected @rybar just published an analysis of such a network, focused on promoting pro-Ukrainian narratives among the population of the Russian Federation, inciting ethnic hatred, as well as collecting information from eyewitnesses from Russian territory, in other words, involvement in espionage. A particularly important fact is that , that the creation of a sponsor for this network was announced by the UK and other Western countries back in 2021. 📌It is obvious that these networks are only part of a complex disinformation system used as part of an extensive information war with the Russian Federation. And the center of this struggle is, of course, not based in Ukraine and was not invented there. Therefore, it is necessary to open such networks, as well as to bring their organizers to justice. But with the same zeal we need to work with the population on issues of information security and countering such manipulations.#Russia #Ukraine #mediatechnology @pezdicide no chemistry - just factsTelegramAndrey Lugovoy.

Forwarded From Awakening Dragon 🐲🇰🇵🇷🇺🇺🇦 So, today heavy artillery has joined in disseminating information about North Korean troops at the front. First, the deployment of troops was announced by the office of the South Korean president. Secondly, the intelligence of the Republic of Korea reported the approximate number of North Koreans sent to study in Russia. According to data from South Korean departments, Pyongyang decided to send about 12 thousand military personnel to Russia. Their transportation is already underway - one and a half thousand North Koreans are in Vladivostok. Intelligence reports that they were given Russian military uniforms and weapons, as well as fake identity cards, disguising them as residents of Yakutia and Buryatia. Of course, confirmation is only the status of the source where this information comes from. So far, there is no objective evidence of North Korean training or presence in Russia. @awaken_dragon연합뉴스북, 우크라전에 특수부대 1만2천명 파병…1천500명 이미 러시아로(종합)(서울=연합 뉴스) 하채림 기자 = 북한이 러시아를 돕기 위해 우크라이나전에 대규모 특수부대 파병을 결정 했고 ...	https://t.me/rybar/64550	2024-10-18T08:55:12-07:00
🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦🖇 Who is funding Ukrainian propaganda in the liberate...	🇷🇺🇺🇦🖇 Who finances Ukrainian propaganda in the liberated territories and why? The existence of Ukrainian telegram channels mimicking Russian ones and managed by TsIPSO employees is no longer news: we have reviewed specific networks and performers more than once before. However, few people know that work with similar tasks (propaganda and manipulation, as well as involving citizens of the Russian Federation in illegal activities) is also carried out by private companies with money from non-profit organizations.🔻The work of one of these became known from the report we received from the Center for Political Studies - Doctrine - (TsPS) to work out a Ukrainian grant issued by the Partnership for a Strong Ukraine Foundation. The TsPS created and maintains a whole network of channels focused on promoting pro-Ukrainian narratives among the Russian population. The documents directly state that their goals are:➖discrediting Russian information through resources masquerading as pro-Russian;➖sowing ethnic hatred and targeting individual ethnic communities (Crimean Tatars are mentioned in particular);➖gathering information from eyewitnesses from Russian territory (i.e. involvement in espionage).▪️From the same reporting documents, we learned that the administrators of pro-Ukrainian telegram channels are finding it increasingly difficult to do their jobs due to missile strikes by the Russian Armed Forces on energy infrastructure, as well as due to measures taken by Russian authorities to block channels with prohibited content.▪️At the same time, it’s funny how the TsPS was unable to respond to the grant requirement to promote the LGBT agenda (obviously, this is one of the key requirements of the sponsors), formulating only a couple of general phrases about the importance of an individual approach to sources and audiences. ▪️It is interesting that the Center is not only engaged in propaganda on the territory of the Russian Federation, but is also engaged in discrediting the Russian presence in Africa. In particular, they are trying to promote information about the destabilizing role of the Afrika Korps in the Sahel and the alleged disruption of grain supplies due to Russian strikes. It is important that the sponsor of pro-Ukrainian propaganda, the Partnership for a Strong Ukraine Foundation, whose task is formally declared to help the population in the conflict zone, has appeared February 2, 2022 (22 days before the start of the SVO), and its creation was announced by the UK and other Western countries back in 2021. 🔻Using this case as an example, we can once again observe how the infrastructure for NATO multi-domain operations works. After all, it is through such channels that panic is not only dispersed, but also important intelligence information necessary to correct Ukrainian attacks is collected. This means that residents of new regions, especially in the front-line zone, should be more vigilant to requests and calls from suspicious resources.

At the moment, the area is being cleaned up. Due to the fact that the retreating units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces abandon the bodies of their dead soldiers, Russian military personnel are engaged in their burial. ▪️In the Korenevsky district, Russian armored groups made a breakthrough in the direction of Viktorovka, penetrating several kilometers into the control zone of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Information about the liberation of Novoivanovka was received several days ago, but fighting in Viktorovka itself has not yet begun. Ukrainian formations hold positions on the approaches to the village. To the south, fighting continues in the area of ​​Lyubimovka and Nizhny Klin, where Ukrainian formations found themselves in an unenviable position due to the only possibility of retreat - through a rather narrow neck - a bag - east of Tolstoy Lug. Over the past 24 hours, reports have been coming from here about a large number of Ukrainians leaving their positions and surrendering. ▪️In the Sudzhansky district, Russian army fighters knock out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from Plekhovo, where the enemy is also semi-encircled. The most optimistic statements have already contained information about the liberation of this settlement. In addition, the aviation of the Russian Aerospace Forces and other branches of the military are conducting fire work against identified areas of concentration of enemy manpower and equipment both in the occupied territories of the Kursk region and in the Sumy region.

🔁🖼 Military leaders of the Northern Military District. 20 names...	Forwarded From Children of ArbatMilitary Leaders of the Northern Military District. 20 names of 2024 from the Children of Arbat. Colonel General Romanchuk Having revealed the enemy’s plan in the Zaporozhye direction in 2023, in 2024 he returned to the leadership of the combined arms academy, bringing the training process to a fundamentally new level. With the beginning of the Northern Military District, the training time at the academy was significantly reduced: the country needed an updated middle level of command and control, which had absorbed the science of winning directly on the battlefield. After stopping the enemy’s offensive in Zaporozhye, the military-political leadership of the country decided to merge the two Grv(s) into one, which is today led by Mikhail Teplinsky, however, Alexander Romanchuk received an equally difficult personnel task: in a short time it was necessary to update the entire senior officers, and now former commanders of companies and battalions suddenly became commanders of regiments and brigades. In June 2024, Vladimir Putin said that the average age of a division commander is 46 years old and this is fully true: the parade squad of the combined arms academy that took place on May 9, 2024 was really young. And Alexander Romanchuk himself was in charge: the command highly appreciated his services during the SVO, the commander was awarded the Order of Merit for the Fatherland, 2nd and 3rd degree with swords. In April 2024, Alexander Vladimirovich turned 65. During his time working in Academy, he developed friendly relations with many officers, including the recognized veteran Oleg Mussovich Tsekov, with whom they work together to educate young personnel. Romanchuk is not looking for a promotion and does not want to leave, believing that he is in the right place. Today, there are almost no graduates of the Baku Higher Military Education Command left in the ranks of the armed forces; all of them have long since retired, but the name of Alexander Romanchuk, the last of the Mohicans, is still heard. Lieutenant General Peryazev He made a difficult but rapid journey from the post of deputy chief of the Main Combat Training Directorate to deputy commander of the Moscow Military District, proving that there is still room for decency in the army. Having walked the paths of the Kharkov forests in boots with the 6th Army, today Alexander Peryazev and the entire headquarters of the Moscow Military District will have to solve the problem of returning Kupyansk, which was abandoned in the fall of 2022. Just 3 years ago, while organizing the tank biathlon, Alexander Vasilyevich could not even think that he would return to the team path. In 2018, he resigned from the post of commander of the 20th Army, where he was replaced by the current chief of the main staff of the Ground Forces, Evgeny Nikiforov. Peryazev was always inconvenient, in the sense that while remaining executive, he did not like to remain silent and always expressed complaints on the merits. Thus, being the chief judge of the international games in Alabino, Peryazev did not hide his rejection of the format of the events, believing that combat training had been distorted, but at the same time he honestly carried out the assigned tasks. Before the war, many considered Alexander Peryazev to be Buvaltsev’s successor at the post of GUBP, but life always brings adjustments at your discretion. Today, the Moscow Military District headquarters has a balanced team that manages to move the front line forward. The story of Alexander Peryazev is a story that life always puts the emphasis correctly: he worked honestly and was noticed, so today he returned to a command position, proving that in addition to organizing funny competitions that should remain in the past, he is capable of solving the most difficult combat missions.High resolution art@arbat	https://t.me/rybar/64545	2024-10-18T07:22:00-07:00
🖼 🇮🇱🇮🇷 About the upcoming Israeli strike on Iran Colleagues ...	🇮🇱🇮🇷 About Israel's upcoming strike on Iran Colleagues from The Middle East Spectator, citing US intelligence sources, published an intelligence report on Israel's preparations for a strike on Iran.▪️According to these data, the Americans recorded the movement of 40 Rocks air-launched ballistic missiles to air bases Ramon and Ramat David, where F-16 and F-35 fighters are located.▪️Another 16 missiles of only an unidentified Golden Horizon type were delivered to the Hatzerim airbase, where F-15I fighters are located in special hangars. The Americans call them long-range missiles.▪️In addition, on October 15-16, Israeli pilots trained their aircraft to fly at extremely low altitudes, where support was provided by the G-550 AWACS aircraft and Boeing 707 tankers.▪️They started from the Haifa naval base warships will disperse, which also fits into the general logic of what is happening. I would like to add that if the activity of the Israeli Air Force was noted, it was competently covered with sorties for strikes on the Gaza Strip and Lebanon, since the average indicator remained at the same level - 80- 85 flights per day. As for satellite reconnaissance of Israel, one of the main ways the United States monitors Israel is satellite imagery. Every day, Americans photograph important military and industrial facilities, monitoring the activities of the IDF. The unknown type of Golden Horizon missiles looks curious. There is no information about them, so this is either a new development or a code name for some existing missile. Taking into account the choice of type of weapons, we assume that the Israelis will choose the standard route for aircraft to fly across the border line of Syria and Jordan all the way to Iraq, from where launch will take place. However, Rocks are limited to a 300-400 km radius, so to launch them, the IDF will have to get very close to Iran, unlike the Golden Horizon, whose range most likely exceeds 1000 km.

This caused the intensification of hostilities throughout the country.▪️Government forces launched multiple strikes on training camps and gatherings of Islamists from the Al-Qaeda-affiliated group JNIM and the local branch of the Islamic State. During one of the raids, a strike from The UAV eliminated an important field commander responsible for multiple attacks on civilian villages and military posts.▪️The militants also continued attacks on military posts. A particularly large attack occurred in the city of Jibo, which is not the first time that it has become the scene of fierce fighting. 🔻At this time, the Prime Minister of Burkina Faso met with the Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation Andrei Belousov. It is possible that the main issue of discussion was the Afrika Korps and its further deployment in the country. Important changes are also planned in the economic sphere - the government of Burkina Faso plans to revoke production permits from foreign companies. The main thing in this is the exception for Russian capital, which, on the contrary, will be given benefits. In this regard, there is an intensification of both business and government departments, which cannot but rejoice.

🇰🇿 Why does Kazakhstan refuse to join BRICS? Presidential Press...	🇰🇿 Why does Kazakhstan refuse to join BRICS? Press Secretary of the President of Kazakhstan Berik Uali recently said that Kazakhstan will refrain from submitting an application to BRICS in the near future. Uali noted that the president has repeatedly spoken out in favor of the UN as a universal and non-alternative organization in which all current international problems can and should be discussed. At the same time, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev does not refuse to participate in the BRICS summit, which will be held in Kazan at the end of the month. ❓What is the reason for this decision? Kazakhstan demonstrates interest in working in specific, specialized formats. These are the EAEU, CSTO and SCO. In all of these organizations, Astana occupied an important role, being in all cases one of the founding states. Kazakhstan does not consider refusal to join BRICS as an anti-Russian or anti-Chinese step. At the same time, Astana understands the geopolitical dimension of BRICS as a platform for the consolidation of the Global South, just as they understand that for Russia the expansion of its membership is important. 🔻Therefore, in Astana they can offer a deal: membership in exchange, for example, for preferential conditions for the construction of nuclear power plants or other trade preferences. Yesterday’s statement by Tokayev, which smoothed out the impression of the situation with BRICS, also speaks in favor of the version of behind-the-scenes bargaining: -Russia’s invincibility is confirmed by its military potential, the population’s support for President Putin, and history itself.- And the time for these negotiations on the eve of the summit in Kazan was chosen in a completely logical way. #Kazakhstan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usKazakhstan's main news - Tengrinews.kzKassym-Jomart Tokayev received proposals for Kazakhstan to join BRICS - Berik UaliAdvisor - Press Secretary of the President Berik Uali answered questions Tengrinews.kz.

Multiple attempts to seize livestock and religious taxes from local communities were prevented. Islamists also continued to attack small military posts. Major militant attacks on Eknewan and Nyakatira failed to be repulsed and the attackers managed to seize a significant amount of weapons. Non-religious pro-Western rebels who emerged after the 2023 coup are also making their presence felt. Small groups, which were not particularly noted, apart from small actions, announced consolidation in the so-called. -Free Armed Forces-. ▪️Despite the vast area of ​​activity, they only rarely dare to attack military convoys.&nbsp; Therefore, this step looks more like an attempt to get Western funding than to create a real security threat to the ruling regime. Thus, the French, who were recently expelled from uranium deposits, can take advantage of these groups, hoping to return pro-Western leadership to power. ▪️Meanwhile, the transitional authorities continue their anti-colonial course. The renaming of French street names in Niamey is a small but significant step in this direction. So, in the capital, Charles De Gaulle Avenue disappeared, which was renamed in honor of the national hero. But at the same time, interaction with Turkish industrialists continues. The authorities purchased 5 UAVs -Karayel-, which became known to the world during the conflict between the Saudis and the Houthis, since it was there that Saudi Arabia actively used them.🔻The pragmatism and multi-vector nature of Niamey politicians should not be surprising. Turkish drones are cheap compared to other models, and have already shown effectiveness in low-intensity conflicts. At the same time, in many projects, the Niger authorities are still inclined towards greater cooperation with Russia, including in the field of security.

Four Su-24M bombers took off from the Starokonstantinov airfield and flew east. At the same time, MiG-29 and Su-27 fighters took off from Uman, Dolgintsevo, Mirgorod and Kanatovo as part of covering cruise missile carriers and launching ADM-160 MALD decoy missiles. As a result, eight missiles were fired from the Su-24M, which flew to the east of Crimea, and with them the decoys. As a result, five missiles were shot down by the air defense of the 31st division, and three more were suppressed by electronic warfare.🔻Despite the prolonged absence of Su-24M strikes on Russian territories, the enemy’s tactics remained virtually unchanged. While the Su-24Ms are approaching the line, decoys are launched. Judging by the missiles’ flight route, the target could be the airfield in Kirovskoye or air defense positions covering the Crimean bridge. Nobody thinks that because of the situation at the front, the Ukrainian Armed Forces will abandon their cherished goal? As long as the enemy has aviation and supplies of long-range missiles, which were noted exactly before the strike, such raids will continue. And with permission to attack inland from the West, this may affect other territories.

The main event, undoubtedly, was the raid of the Wagner PMC with the aim of returning the remains of soldiers to their homeland.▪️ Let us remind you that thanks to the conclusions made during the previous bitter experience, this time there were almost no losses. All the ambushes were circumvented, and the enemy was forced to believe in other goals of the operation.▪️An important event was the attack of radical Islamists on the airport of the country's capital Bamako and the nearby gendarme barracks. A small group of militants was able to temporarily seize the air harbor and damage civilian ships. They did not reach the military part of the facility.▪️Another intensification of government forces along the Mauritanian border is also observed. During the latest events, more than 50 Islamists hiding along the border strip were detained and eliminated. Unfortunately, during one of the clashes, the commander of the 9th assault detachment of the PMC - Wagner - under the call sign - Michael - was killed.▪️Meanwhile, in the north, militants associated with -Al Qaeda factions of the JNIM attempted to carry out a massive attack in the north of the country. The cities of Timbuktu, Ber and Gao were hit. An attempt to shell airports did not bring them success. As well as the use of cars with suicide bombers, they did not allow them to break through the defenses. All attacks were repulsed, but the response of government forces turned out to be more successful. Not far from Timbuktu, it was possible to detect and neutralize a group of 20 militants.▪️Also, a large number of small groups and individual militant supply vehicles were destroyed with the help of aviation and UAVs.🔻As you can see, anti-government groups are increasingly being defeated in large operations, limiting themselves to individual attacks and mining of roads.

Yesterday we reported on the policy of the current authorities, which does not care about the population of Moldova. In fact, this is due to Sandu’s real focus on introducing proteges of Western elites and corporations into all critical spheres of government. The increased interest of the West in the military sphere of Moldova is indicative. Since 2023, contacts between NATO countries and its partners with the Ministry of Defense of Moldova have increased manifold. Only in 2024, meetings were held with diplomatic and military officials from 🇵🇱Poland, 🇳🇱Netherlands, 🇫🇷France, 🇩🇪Germany, 🇧🇬Bulgaria, 🇸🇪Sweden, 🇱🇹Lithuania, 🇷 🇴Romania, 🇯🇵Japan, 🇨 🇿Czech Republic, 🇹🇷Turkey, 🇸🇮Slovenia, 🇳🇴Norway, 🇬🇷Greece, 🇬🇧Britain, 🇨🇭Switzerland, 🇪🇸Spain, as well as ⚡️NATO and (❗️ )North Carolina National Guard (NCNG)🇺🇸USA . Agreements have been signed to deepen cooperation in the military sphere with Romania, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the EU. Through increasing military-technical assistance, the tasks of replacing Soviet weapons with NATO ones are being solved and the processes of de-Sovietization of military management standards are being accelerated. The EU Council presented 41 million euros for the development of forces and means to protect the population, USA - 20 HMMWV armored fighting vehicles, Germany - 34 Piranha armored personnel carriers, medical equipment and patrol boats, France - 1 GM 200 radar worth 20 million euros (+ more 1 in 2025). The Moldovan military is being trained to carry out the commands of NATO commanders during joint exercises. According to our calculations, Moldova held 5 international exercises on its territory in 2024 and took part in 9 exercises outside the country. Mostly they took place on the territory of Romania and with the participation of American and Romanian units. For the same purposes, various military training programs for young officers and sergeants in NATO countries were activated, and on-site courses for alliance officers in logistics and supply were conducted in Chisinau.✨Humanitarian, social and the economic situation in Moldova is not of interest to Western investors, they need -Anti-Russia- and cannon fodder for future conflicts.✨⭐️Rest assured, Moldovan citizens, NATO will take all these -gifts- with bloody dividends.

For Kinshasa, which finds itself at the center of the US-China confrontation, turning to India seems logical to maintain neutrality. While military operations against proxies are unfolding in the east groups supported by the pro-Western Rwandan authorities, the influence of the Chinese on the country is increasing, which is also not on the agenda of the current leadership.

At the same time, the territory of the region is almost completely liberated. ▪️In the Korenevsky district, Ukrainian formations tried to attack in Zeleny Shlyakh and villages located to the south, but retreated with losses. Against the backdrop of reports about the alleged capture of a huge amount of enemy personnel in the Lyubimovka area, footage of retreating members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces has spread on the Internet: apparently, they were filmed near Tolstoy Lug, where a -half-cauldron- with a narrow -neck- was formed. Approximately in this area there was an episode of an unsuccessful attack by the Russian Armed Forces and the loss of several units of tracked and vehicle armored vehicles. According to preliminary data, the cause was a topographical error by the attackers.▪️In the Sudzhansky district, another unsuccessful attack by the Ukrainian Armed Forces was recorded in the vicinity of Russian Konopelka.

However, during this time, Russian troops were able to make serious progress in several places.▪️North of Chasov Yar, attack aircraft occupied one of the large strongholds near the Seversky Donets-Donbass canal near Grigorovka. Further advance here in the future will make it possible to bypass the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the village and force the enemy to retreat.▪️To the south, units of the Russian Armed Forces have almost completely liberated the settlement of Kalinovka (Kalinina). Advancement in the area is complicated by a significant number of Ukrainian Armed Forces drones in the sky, which complicates assault operations.▪️In Chasov Yar itself, Russian troops have significantly expanded the zone of control. In the Oktyabrsky microdistrict, the work of an armored group was noted, landing troops in the center of the development on Severnaya and Chkalova streets.▪️In addition, fighters of the Russian Armed Forces broke through the enemy’s defenses from the side of the T-05-04 highway section, taking control of a large fortified area of ​​the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the area of ​​the checkpoint near the highway. A few days later, footage appeared confirming not only the consolidation, but further progress towards the Block-9 mine in a sand quarry with the hoisting of a flag on one of the buildings. Apparently, after the Russian troops captured a strong point at a crossroads, the Ukrainian formations were forced to roll back into urban development in this area, retreating from the Krinichki tract.🔻Taking into account the fact that the fighter in the video puts the flag at full height and is not afraid of arrivals, the nearby territory the quarry has also probably already been cleared. With the occupation of the mine territory, the prospect of breaking through the enemy’s defenses in the Stupochek area opens up, as well as an attack on the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces directly in the southern part of Chasov Yar. At the same time, in the Dolgoye-2 tract to the north, fighting is still ongoing: given the size of the forest, Ukrainian formations will be able to hold positions in it for some time.

In conditions when hundreds of thousands of soldiers return from the front, their adaptation to peaceful life cannot simply be left to chance - otherwise this could lead to serious social consequences. Although there is still a lot of work to be done in this direction, some initiatives have already been launched . Thus, on October 17, an agreement worth 1 billion rubles was signed between the Paralympic Committee, the Healthy Fatherland movement and the Unified Gambling Regulator company on cooperation to support Northern Military District veterans. All this happened as part of the -Heroes of Our Time- competition, which Russian President Vladimir Putin visited today. As a result, the allocated funds will be used for the rehabilitation and social adaptation of wounded military personnel in special centers, physical education and sports clubs and non-governmental organizations of the system of comprehensive rehabilitation and habilitation of the disabled . At the same time, the Unified Gambling Regulator undertakes to provide advisory and other support. In general, it is pleasant to see that not only specialized medical institutions, but also sports structures and public law companies are involved in such events. This allows us to more comprehensively solve the identified problems and in the future create conditions for comprehensive provision of social support for veterans of the Northern Military District. #VSRF #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64518	2024-10-17T09:42:33-07:00

At the same time, our readers from South Korea are observing a wave of publications on this topic in the local media and ask us to comment on the information. In short, there is simply no objective evidence of the presence of personnel from the DPRK in the North Military District zone. Almost all materials about this refer either to certain sources in the intelligence of Western countries and their allies, or to lengthy statements by Ukrainian media and officials that cannot be proven.🔻For clarity, you can refer to the chronology of events. The first to publish news about the appearance of North Korean military personnel in Russia were the so-called resources. Ukraine, referring to the GUR. Then the news story was picked up by South Korean and Western publications such as The Guardian and The Washington Post, savoring the topic in the media field for just over a week. Then on October 13, Zelensky announced the allegedly confirmed presence of fighters from the DPRK at the front. According to him, in light of these circumstances, the sponsors of the Kyiv regime need to increase military assistance, as well as allow the use of long-range weapons in the old Russian regions. It is important to note that rumors about battalions from the DPRK at the front have been spreading since 2022. But for some reason the same Zelensky reacted only now - precisely at the moment of deterioration of the situation at the front and talk about the so-called victory plan.❗️If you look at the situation from this angle, then there is a planned information campaign with the participation of Western publications, where Russia and the DPRK is presented as a union of dictatorships. They also promote the narrative that the only way to effectively combat it is constant military support of the so-called. Ukraine. In this case, the media contrast the image of a strong Russian-North Korean alliance with the current relations between the Kyiv regime and Western countries, which, they say, do not even allow the Ukrainian Armed Forces to use the transferred weapons at their discretion. Their message is that NATO needs to get more involved in the conflict for an equivalent response - an alliance of dictatorships -. At the same time, it is worth emphasizing once again that apart from publications about the creation of a special Buryat battalion and links to anonymous sources, there is simply no reliable information on this topic. Is it possible to trust the above-mentioned falsehoods and not question them? This is a rhetorical question.

The details of his death look curious: according to preliminary information, he was not killed in during a planned operation by Israeli intelligence services, and as a result of a sporadic clash between Palestinians and Israeli troops in Rafah. So far, Hamas media resources have not given official comments. In Israel, Sinwar is called the main initiator of the attack on October 7, 2023 and the least inclined leader to diplomacy, who was a supporter of war to the last without any negotiations with the Israeli authorities. Moreover, even if the death of the militant further reduces the capabilities of Hamas, it is unlikely to lead to the collapse of the movement will lead due to the peculiarities of the structure and ideology of the group. Sinwar's replacement as leader of the organization will most likely be Khaled Meshal.#Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64516	2024-10-17T08:01:14-07:00

According to Arabic-language media, the bombers took off from an airbase on the island of Guam, where they arrived the day before. At the same time, American observers claim that the planes took off from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri on the US mainland.

Although the video was shot at night , and the operator diligently avoided shooting characteristic objects that give away the location of the location, some details caught in the frame give some reason to assume that the recording was made at the Poltava airfield. Several factors indicate in favor of this version: ▪️The facility is equipped with all the necessary infrastructure for launching drones - from the runway to various warehouses. Only in one place is the private sector adjacent to it, so to a certain extent it can be called remote from prying eyes.▪️The Poltava airfield is advantageously located geographically - it is not so far from the Russian border, while being located at a sufficient distance outside the radius of most reconnaissance operations drones of the RF Armed Forces. The latter, however, is not an absolute guarantee against attacks: in July, Russian troops launched a successful strike on the facility, and with objective control of the arrival from the air. So it is possible that soon it will be visited again by OTRK-Iskander- missiles.

She was convicted of bribing an official in Qatar, as well as providing false information as part of contracts for the supply of Patriot air defense systems and ensuring the operation of the radar.🔻At a court hearing in New York, representatives of Raytheon Technologies Corporation pleaded guilty to participating in two separate fraud schemes, concluding an agreement on Deferred Prosecution for a period of three years. It requires Raytheon to hire an independent compliance officer for three years, improve its internal compliance program, notify the Department of Justice of any violations, and actively cooperate in ongoing and future criminal investigations. .📌 In general, the event once again confirms what is now being trumpeted from every corner: the American defense industry is a bottomless well of opportunities for theft, corruption and various schemes with a multimillion-dollar turnover.

Rybar: 🇹🇷🇺🇦 Turkish Defense Minister Yashar Güler recently spoke about the need to expand the country’s military-industrial complex in order to provide the country’s army with weapons of its own production. The reason for such a statement was the increased consumption of military-industrial complex products from... 🇷🇺🇸🇾🇹🇷 Although, for objective reasons, Turkish foreign military activity has decreased, this is still not equivalent to its complete cessation. This can be clearly seen from the latest events in Idlib. For several days in a row, the Russian Aerospace Forces attacked the positions of pro-Turkish groups in the part of Syria they occupied. The reason was information about the activation of gangs on the line of contact, including in the Serakib sector.🔻What special happened that Russian aviation had to work so actively? The fact is that the Turkish authorities began to transfer short-range air defense systems to Idleby: for now we are talking about MANPADS, but it cannot be ruled out that the HISAR A+ air defense system could also be transferred along with them. Helping militants to counter Russia under a false flag is quite typical for the Turks tactics. Moreover, where, if not in a zone of constant instability, is it best to test your military developments? Syria itself is still on the verge of an explosion: the country seems to be sitting on a powder keg, which can detonate at the slightest spark. Those simply interested in this are either looking for a reason or waiting for an advantageous moment. Well, when the so-called Disinformation Center under the Turkish Presidential Administration says that the country’s armed forces are not involved in clashes, this is usually confirmation of the opposite. #Russia #Syria # Türkiye@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64511	2024-10-17T03:44:06-07:00

🇹🇷🇺🇦 Turkish Defense Minister Yashar Güler recently spoke abo...	🇹🇷🇺🇦 Turkish Defense Minister Yashar Güler recently spoke about the need to expand the country’s military-industrial complex in order to provide the country’s army with weapons of its own production. The reason for this statement was the increased consumption of military-industrial complex products due to supplies to the Kyiv regime. According to Güler, during the Northern Military District, about 30 countries were unable to meet the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine for ammunition, including Turkey itself.🔻The Turks at the very beginning of the conflict really supplied the Armed Forces of Ukraine with almost everything they could. Among the transferred systems were Kirpi armored vehicles, Sakarya MLRS and 155-mm artillery mounts, various UAVs, and, of course, ammunition. But over time, it became clear that production numbers did not catch up with the size of shells fired per day. This prompted NATO countries to increase efforts in the military-industrial complex throughout Europe. This also affected Turkey and even affected its own foreign policy adventures. Thus, one of the reasons for the protracted operation in Syria and Iraq is inflated expectations and a lack of understanding of their real capabilities.📌 As you may recall, the Turkish armed forces began to fight for their health, wedging in the north of these countries. This happened largely thanks to powerful artillery preparation, but then problems began with both high-precision weapons and shots. Combat operations in the so-called. Ukraine and the supply of Ukrainian Armed Forces have further exposed problems in the NATO military-industrial complex. Therefore, now the Turks have reduced their foreign activity - this can be seen not only in Syria and Iraq, but also in Libya - concentrating efforts on building up military power. şar Güler , -Ukraine-Rusya savaşında görüldü ki yaklaşık 30 ülke bir araya gelerek Ukrayna'nın mühimmat ihtiyacını karşılayamadı.

Forwarded From Severyanochka🇳🇴🇷🇺 NUPI employee Jakub Godzimirski and Nansen Institute director Iver Neumann commented on recent public statements by the Russian and Norwegian Foreign Ministries. In short, both experts believe that Moscow will not resort to expelling Norwegian diplomats, since the embassy is already In Norway, everyone is now working on the verge of a nervous breakdown. In their opinion, we should expect some kind of -mafia- actions from Russia, such as cutting off electricity or water in the embassy building or in the ambassador’s residence, which could create additional inconvenience for employees and have a psychological impact on them. ❓When asked what caused the reduction in the number of Russian diplomats, Godzimirski replied that Oslo probably believes that there is simply no need for such a large number of employees, and that, most likely, Russia is using them for intelligence.🔺 What is there to comment on? To begin with, I was right: the staff of the Norwegian Embassy in Moscow, reduced to nine people, cannot cope with its work. And Oslo, apparently, is not happy with this. But who is to blame for this? Starting to expel Russian diplomats when you have almost half as many employees on your staff - 22 versus 40 - is somewhat reckless, isn’t it? ▪ As for logic, Godzimirski makes the same mistake here: he claims that the current staff of Russian foreign agencies is redundant. Let me remind you that in April 2023, through the efforts of Oslo, the number of Russian diplomats in Norway was reduced to 22 people. And if this number is now, according to the expert, too many and half of them are engaged in espionage activities, then how can one explain that before the start of the SVO, exactly the same number of employees worked at the Norwegian embassy, ​​eh? It turns out inconvenient!❗ I would also wonder what motives are actually pursued in Oslo - as you remember, quite recently the Storting approved the state budget for 2025, in which for the first time in the history of Russian-Norwegian relations an item of expenditure allocated for support appeared pro-Western NGOs and liberal media in Russia. Maybe this is the reason why the Norwegians needed to increase the number of embassy staff? #Norway #RussiaSeveryanochkaNRKRussland advarer Norge: – Vår respons blir merkbarRussland reagerer kraftig etter at de måtte kutte antall diplomater i Norge. – De kan lage faen, sier forsker.	https://t.me/rybar/64507	2024-10-16T23:23:02-07:00

At the same time, in the Kremyanoy area, Russian attack aircraft in a heavy battle destroyed an enemy tank that knocked out their armored personnel carrier. 🔻No changes in the combat situation have been recorded in the Glushkovsky district. Russian troops are fighting on the approaches to the New Way, while the enemy has organized a new line of defense south of the railway track. ▪️Presumably, an FV 432 armored personnel carrier was spotted on this section of the front, which had previously appeared on the Internet as being in service with a separate presidential brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. At the moment, it is not entirely clear whether the vehicle was transferred to the Kursk region as part of units from the -native- formation, or was transferred to other units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to replace lost armored vehicles.🔻In the Korenevsky district, the Russian Armed Forces advanced in the eastern part of Lyubimovka with the support of armored vehicles, which is confirmed by objective control footage. Ukrainian formations launched an unsuccessful attack on Green Way, relying on Novoivanovka. At the same time, the road between Zeleny Shlyakh and Lyubimovka is mined, which complicates the interaction of Russian units - in a video that appeared on the Internet, the armored group of the Russian Armed Forces mentioned above lost at least one armored car here. ▪️In the Sverdlikovo area, according to some information, Russian troops -covered- a convoy of armored vehicles of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, moving towards the Green Way. The defeat was inflicted with the help of MLRS -Tornado- and OTRK -Iskander-M-. ❗️Frames have appeared on the Internet showing an episode of one of the battles southwest of Kremyany. The Russian armored personnel carrier, apparently, mistook the Ukrainian Armed Forces tanks for friendly ones, as a result of which it approached them at a dangerous distance and was destroyed by a direct hit. Nevertheless, a significant part of the landing party survived, the fighters left the armored personnel carrier and took up positions in the nearest forest belt, taking advantage of the poor visibility of the Ukrainian Armed Forces crew. After this, the enemy tank was destroyed by the surviving Russian attack aircraft. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, the situation at the Kolmakov-Agronomist border has not changed. To the south, the enemy launched an attack in the Plekhovo area with the goal of dislodging the Russian Armed Forces from their previously occupied positions near the Psel River. The attack was repelled by Russian troops with the support of aviation and artillery. 🔻In the Sumy region, the Russian Aerospace Forces attacked the rear infrastructure of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Yunakovka, Miropolye and Alexandria, and the Geran-2 UAV attacked targets in Akhtyrka.

Forwarded From Severyanochka🇳🇴🇷🇺 During the exercises, NATO and Norwegian military personnel used the Somulator information environment, which allows simulating information and psychological operations in social networks and the media. For this purpose, clones of popular social networks and news sites in the West, created on the basis of the open source software. The exercise leader sets the scenario for the spread of fake and provocative news in the media and monitors the actions of the trainees. Here is one of the scenarios that was practiced in previous years:📌 Setting: The large autocratic country of Brutopia wants to influence the national elections in the small neighboring country of Cardamonia. If the voting results change in just two constituencies, it will change the balance of power from Party X to Party Y, which wants to change the current sanctions affecting Brutopia.▪ A year or two before the election, content is published and promoted on the two most popular social media platforms in Cardamonia , indicating that the country is suffering from sanctions more than Brutopia. Content is posted to business and work-related groups through a number of accounts that claim to belong to international businessmen. ▪ News sites controlled by Brutopia publish exclusive interviews with Party Y representatives, exaggerating their importance and extolling them as people who can open doors for business in Brutopia. ▪ Several months before the elections, several videos appeared online showing children suffering from hunger in Brutopia due to sanctions. Videos are published on Brutopia's official news channels, human rights channels, and mentioned in tweets from bot accounts.▪ In the weeks leading up to the election, conspiracy theories emerge in private groups claiming that party leader X is benefiting from sanctions and is being secretly paid by one of Brutopia's opponents . These statements appear on many platforms and are spread by opposition groups.▪ Two days before the election, emails are leaked, allegedly belonging to the leaders of Party X in one of the two constituencies that Brutopia wants to influence. Information is being spread through a leak that party X is going to close the local factory if they are re-elected.🔺 I don’t think it’s worth explaining which countries are meant by their code names? Somulator was developed by researchers at the Norwegian Defense Research Institute (FFI) together with specialists from the Trondheim University of Natural Sciences and Technology (NTNU). It is distinguished by flexible scalability and ease of use: it can be used both for small classroom activities and for large-scale national exercises. heter Somulator.

This was stated by the Minister of Digital Development of Kazakhstan Zhaslan Madiyev at a meeting with representatives of the US Chamber of Commerce and large American companies. Also present at the meeting, according to the ministry, were representatives of Apple and Meta. Zhaslan Madiev clarified that opening an office is required in accordance with the legislation of Kazakhstan.🔻After the arrest of Pavel Durov in France, it becomes clear that the conditions for using the messenger will change separately selected countries, based on the political situation.

🇫🇷🇺🇦✈️ On the supply of French drones to the Armed Forces of ...	🇫🇷🇺🇦✈️ About the supply of French drones to the Armed Forces of Ukraine French Minister of Defense Sebastian Lecornu announced the supply of the so-called. Ukraine's own production of drones, planned for October. In February, he already announced the order of more than 2,000 new attack drones, the first 100 of which were planned to be transferred to the Ukrainian Armed Forces. From media publications, it can be assumed that this is a Colibri-type UAV from the Delair company in Toulouse - local resources even managed to dub them analogues of Russian -Lancets- . On paper, this looks like significant assistance to Ukrainian formations, but everything, as often happens, lies in the details: ▪️Judging by the data published on the Internet, the combat radius of Colibri is only 5 km. This is a minuscule value for a kamikaze drone compared not only to Lancets, but even to FPV drones, which have long been reaching beyond 10 km.▪️The cost of one Colibri is estimated at 20 thousand euros (2 million rubles), which looks like a disproportionately inflated amount for a product with such mediocre declared characteristics. There is also no talk about the presence of a complex similar to Lancetov’s.▪️Finally, the development of this UAV was first announced in France in the summer of 2022. If during this time the French were able to roll out a copy of the far from most successful American Switchblade, then this casts doubt on its combat value in the current realities. It is hardly worth using this as a reason to laugh at the -stupid French- who ignore the realities of the Northern Military District: as shown practice, even one’s own experience is not so easy to assimilate, and in the case of someone else’s, the process becomes much more difficult.

🖼 🇰🇵🇰🇷 About the undermining of roads connecting the two Kor...	🇰🇵🇰🇷 About the undermining of roads connecting the two Koreas The situation in the Asia-Pacific region continues to remain tense. On October 15, the North Korean military blew up sections of roads along the Kenison and Donghae lines connecting the country with the south of the Korean Peninsula. In response to the explosions, the South Korean military opened warning fire. It is important to note that the bombed roads have not been used by the parties for quite a long time, so they are of no practical importance. The main significance of these road lines lies in their symbolism: last year, the DPRK officially abandoned the concept of peaceful unification of the two states. Now the authorities in Pyongyang view their neighbor as a hostile state, and not as a confused part of their country. Given the campaign to destroy any symbols of unification that began this year, the road bombing is not surprising. 🔻The chances of such a policy causing a war are very small. This is indicated by the fact that the North Korean military announced in advance the bombing of roads, although without a specific date. The country's military authorities, among other things, contacted American troops in South Korea, warning them about the explosions in order to avoid incidents. Although there is tension on the peninsula due to the new DPRK policy, it is still under control. If real escalation begins in the region, which is now an unlikely scenario, then it could be caused by completely different events, for example, the recent flight of South Korean drones over Pyongyang.

🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦 About the attack on an armored plant in Nikolaev Yest...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 About the attack on an armored tank plant in Nikolaev. Yesterday, footage of a missile attack on an armored tank plant (BTRZ) in Nikolaev appeared on the resources of the Russian Ministry of Defense. Judging by the video, ballistic missiles hit the repair and assembly shop, a site with an overhead crane and a parking lot for storing equipment. Coordinates: 46.953466, 32.006687 We wrote about the activities of the enterprise at the very, very beginning of the Northern Military District. Although it was repeatedly targeted by the Russian Armed Forces, it was not possible to destroy the relatively small plant - single strikes did not cause significant damage to the complex, and the enemy repaired the damage and continued work. However, now there is a chance that the object is indeed at least temporarily disabled: according to some data, this time the damage from the arrivals greatly exceeded the effect of previous attacks. A sump for storing equipment was also targeted, so the enemy could still lose several repaired vehicles. At the same time, two important points can be noted: On the one hand, it is gratifying to see that five ballistic missiles were allocated to destroy the plant at once. It seems that over time, an understanding has come that it is more effective and cheaper to fire five Iskanders in a salvo and be guaranteed to disable the object than to fire one once every three months, spend 20 and achieve nothing. At the same time, persistence in restoring the Nikolaev BTRZ, after all the arrivals since the beginning of the Northern Military District, speaks of the importance of such enterprises for the Kyiv regime, contrary to the opinion that such production is very easy to deploy anywhere. If it were really like this, the enemy would not cling to the old Soviet factories in the front-line zone.❗️ Therefore, the defeat of key workshops of operating enterprises of the Ukrainian military-industrial complex in Kharkov, Nikolaev or occupied Zaporozhye can cause much more serious damage to the Armed Forces of Ukraine than it might seem at first glance. The question is the rational determination of priorities in the selection of targets and equipment.

Ukraine in the USA at the end of September. In essence, this is again a paraphrased list of demands to NATO about the deployment of new weapons, the lifting of restrictions on long-range missiles and new sanctions against Russia. It was not worth expecting something fundamentally different, given the current position of the collective West and the state of affairs at the front. As we have already They said that Washington and London are following the path of gradually increasing the level of escalation, largely for reasons of political necessity, and the current situation suits them for now. In addition, the USA and Great Britain are actually openly forcing the Kiev regime to fight until the last Ukrainian to do the dirty work in their own interests, without incurring much risk. Zelensky himself indirectly confirmed this today, saying that Ukraine has strategic mineral resources (uranium, titanium, lithium, graphite) worth trillions of dollars, which must be protected in the interests of NATO. And perhaps this is the main conclusion that should be taken from today’s speech. #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramTwo majors Zelensky presented in the Verkhovna Rada - the Victory Plan -: ▪️Ukraine in NATO - right now. ▪️Continuation of operations on Russian territory and lifting restrictions on strikes on its territory.

US development Ghost Mantis. SRC has introduced a multifunctional electronic warfare system called -Ghost Mantis-, designed for use on unmanned platforms. This system is capable of not only detecting and identifying new threats, but also carrying out operations to create interference and disinformation of the enemy. Ghost Mantis integrates elements of artificial intelligence and machine learning, allowing it to quickly adapt to new threats and deceive opponents in real time. It also supports joint combat control (CCA) systems, which can create the illusion of increased numbers of combat units on the battlefield, misleading the enemy into wasting resources on decoys.2. Modular Pulsar systems from Anduril Industries. Anduril Industries has released a line of Pulsar systems that use artificial intelligence to quickly recognize and eliminate threats in the electronic warfare spectrum. Pulsar features an open architecture and supports integration with various platforms, including ground vehicles and aircraft carriers. It is capable of performing multiple missions such as electronic countermeasures, counter-unmanned systems, electronic reconnaissance and electronic attack. The main feature of the system is its ability to quickly configure and deploy new modules to combat new threats in a matter of days.3. Updated electronic warfare system for the F-16 from Northrop Grumman. The United States has successfully tested the new AN/ALQ-257 IVEWS (Integrated Viper Electronic Warfare Suite) electronic warfare system for its F-16 fighters. This system uses ultra-wideband architecture and is designed to counter advanced electronic threats. It is integrated with other fighter systems and has undergone a series of tests in challenging environments, demonstrating the ability to operate safely in intense electronic countermeasures environments.4. NATO exercise -Thor's Hammer-. Exercise Thor's Hammer in 2024 became NATO's largest event to test electronic warfare technologies. They were attended by 14 countries that tested systems to counter radio-controlled explosive devices (C-RCIED) and small unmanned systems (C-sUAS). The exercise was conducted for the first time in the United States at Camp Atterbury and the Muscatatuck Urban Training Center, allowing participants to test the equipment in an environment that closely resembles real-life urban combat operations. These developments and events demonstrate significant progress in integrating artificial intelligence, automation and open architectures into systems Electronic warfare, as well as increased coordination between Western countries as part of testing new technologies.

This was announced by Swedish Foreign Minister Maria Stenergaard. Moreover, meetings of Western diplomats with the citizens themselves were also announced. ▪️The head of the Latvian Foreign Ministry, Baiba Brazhe, distinguished herself with a speech that in her country Moldova is well known for its football team and wine, and at the last Eurovision - a showcase of Western LGBT values ​​- Latvians supported the Moldovans. After all, what could be a better expression of support? ▪️Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna spoke about the mythical economic growth in his country thanks to the EU, and also about the fact that Estonians became -independent- thanks to European integration after the -experience of Soviet occupation-. However, they forgot to talk about the catastrophic outflow of the population, which, however, is typical for the entire Baltic region.▪️Danish Foreign Minister Lars Rasmussen tried to convince Moldovans that joining the EU does not mean a loss of sovereignty, but only a strengthening of their voice in the international arena.🔻The fact that foreign officials They are openly campaigning in Moldova, and it doesn’t bother anyone. But in Chisinau and in the West they continue to accuse Russia of interfering in the elections. The visit of the foreign ministers of the most Russophobic states is a good reinforcement after the voyage of the head of the European Commission, Ursula Von der Leyen, to Chisinau just the day before.

Letters have been sent to Edinburgh residents stating that even activities in private premises may be an offense if they are seen or heard within those areas and if they cause alarm or distress to patients and staff. Prohibited activities include preaching and silent speech. vigils that are carried out -intentionally or recklessly-. Substantial fines are also provided for distributing religious literature, pro-life leaflets and attempts to dissuade and reason with clinic visitors in designated areas. Similar measures will come into force in England and Wales at the end of October. Currently, English law prohibits all of the above anywhere within a 150-meter radius of these clinics. Opponents of abortion and Christian activists call the new law sinister and Orwellian, predicting that now anyone can be arrested even just for praying at home. For our part, we would like to note that the activists get the point correctly - under the pretext of protecting citizens from unstable characters who threaten hell for all women , leaving and entering the clinic for a variety of reasons, legislation has been passed that could potentially affect the rights of citizens on religious grounds. It is doubtful that people will begin to be arrested for praying in their homes in the near future, but a very interesting category of actions - committed with recklessness - can amaze with its interpretation a circle of people that is much wider than the local anti-abortion community. @dixi_devil - keep your eyes openChristianpostPraying at home may be a criminal offense in Scotland under new lawScotland has enacted new abortion legislation that could criminalize praying at home within designated zones The Abortion Services Act Scotland 2024 could result in prosecution for activities	https://t.me/rybar/64480	2024-10-16T02:29:01-07:00
🇦🇲🇺🇸🇦🇿 About behind-the-scenes agreements between Armenia a...	🇦🇲🇺🇸🇦🇿 About behind-the-scenes agreements between Armenia and NATO Azerbaijani media have been actively disseminating materials in recent days about the possible details of the meeting of the Secretary of the Security Council of Armenia Armen Grigoryan with representatives of the NATO Military Committee, which took place on September 30 in Brussels. The information war between Azerbaijan and Armenia requires criticism such articles, but most of the theses fit into the logic of the policy of the Armenian authorities.🔻NATO outpost in Transcaucasia➖They write that Grigoryan expressed Yerevan’s readiness to become the new southern flank of NATO and facilitate the construction of air bases and the deployment of air defense units of the alliance. The parties could come to agreements on the construction of a center for mountain rifle troops in the south of Armenia, where NATO troops will be present. ▪️The USA and France really indicate their military presence in Armenia, and an adviser from Washington has already appeared in the Ministry of Defense of the republic. It is no coincidence that the south of Armenia appears, since consolidation in the Syunik region is associated with control over the opening of regional communications. There is also a border with Iran, approaching which is important for the West. Information has already appeared about the equipment of a position there for American reconnaissance maneuver groups that monitor the activities of Tehran and missile launches against Israel. Purges of pro-Russian personnel ➖At the meeting, the problem of a large number of pro-Russian personnel in the security structures of Armenia was voiced. Grigoryan assured that work was underway to purge departments of Russian agents and in return requested expert support from Western intelligence services.▪️More than a realistic thesis, given the active work of the Americans to bribe Armenian security forces. And Grigoryan himself is openly called a protege of the US CIA, who is always present at negotiations with the Americans and is precisely responsible for clearing out pro-Russian forces.🔻Elections in Georgia ➖At the meeting they could discuss the possibilities of Armenia to influence the upcoming parliamentary elections in Georgia in areas of compact ethnic Armenians and recruiting the latter to participate in the protest movement.▪️The West is really preparing for a scenario of a violent change of power in Georgia. What might be the interest of Armenia? The pragmatic orientation of the current Georgian authorities is slowing down Armenia’s western turn. Without EU-controlled Georgia, Armenia risks becoming cut off - a pro-Western enclave - in the region.🔻Relations with Azerbaijan ➖According to media reports, Armenia is calling on the West to put pressure on Azerbaijan before the COP-29 climate conference in Baku. Yerevan hopes to sign a truncated version of the peace agreement, after which the procedure for leaving the CSTO can begin. However, the Azerbaijani media claim that Armenia is allegedly ready, with the support of the West, to go to a small, victorious war in order to gain a foothold on the undivided sections of the border, as well as to raise the morale of the Armenian society. ▪️It is precisely this statement regarding the outbreak of a new war that should be taken critically. Azerbaijani government circles and the media are constantly looking for reasons to aggravate the situation and justify militarization. Moreover, recently Azerbaijani drones have become more active on the southern borders and a violent scenario on this section of the border cannot be ruled out. It is unlikely that the Armenians will resort to it, given the deplorable state of their army in comparison with the Azerbaijani one. However, the Americans promised the Armenians harsh times, calling this the price for getting rid of Russian influence, which the Armenian authorities, together with their curators, are trying to implement. So the most unpredictable development of events is possible in the region even after the possible signing of a formal peace treaty. The latter will also become the basis for Armenia's official withdrawal from the CSTO and deeper cooperation with NATO. #Azerbaijan #Armenia #NATO #Russia #USA @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64479	2024-10-16T01:51:01-07:00

In one of the chapters there is an interesting insight - Woodward explains why Trump at one time lifted an informal veto and allowed Republicans in the House of Representatives to vote for the law on the allocation of a $61 billion aid package to Ukraine. As Woodward writes, Trump stated that support for Ukraine is - a waste of taxpayers' money, since -Ukraine is corrupt and Russia's victory is inevitable-. -The former president does not see the point in financing Ukraine,- - this opinion was expressed by the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Republican Mike Johnson, in a narrow circle after numerous conversations with Trump.

Even during the meeting of the President of Equatorial Guinea Nguema Mbasonga with Putin, he thanked Russia for its assistance in strengthening its defense capability and military instructors training the army. Afrika Korps fighters arrived in the country in mid-August, where local media captured them at the residence of the president's son in the capital Malabo. Closer to September, some of the military personnel were sent to the mainland part of the country - the city of Bata. What is interesting is that there are no active conflicts in the country, because Russian instructors rather play a political role, demonstrating support for the current government from Russia. In the context of the global geopolitical confrontation between the United States and China in the region, Ngema Mbasongo is experiencing difficulties in maintaining neutrality, being under pressure from the West. Do not forget that even the Chinese, several years ago, were unable to create a logistics center for their Navy in the country due to opposition from the Americans .🔻As we know, a holy place is never empty, and therefore the fact that our military-diplomatic departments were able to limit the penetration of the West into the territory of Equatorial Guinea is an important precedent that shows the possibilities for further advancement of Russian interests on the Dark Continent.

🇷🇺🇸🇾 Let’s lift the veil of secrecy a little and explain what...	🇷🇺🇸🇾 Let’s lift the veil of secrecy a little and explain what is happening in brotherly Syria. The fact is that recently Russian citizens have begun to have a natural nightmare at the border. Women with children, geologists, tourists - indiscriminately - can be marinated for 3-4 hours at a time -just because-. The formal reason is that after entering electronic visas, the systems crash and need to be reset. And for those who have regular visas, enter them into the electronic database. But in fact - extorting money from Russians for admission to the territory of the country. The price tag, according to rumors, starts from a couple of tens of bucks above - for solving the issue - and higher. It seems like a small thing, but the fact itself is important. It’s all simply because Russians are no longer held in such esteem as they were even a couple of years ago. The protracted air defense system, the lack of response to the military threat to Russian military targets in Syria from Israel, and the unimpeded IDF strikes on Syrian air defense targets are having an impact. In general, the rapid loss of reputation is also felt on earth: now civilians are viewed not as representatives of a great power, but as some kind of foreigners from whom they can get something without any problems.📍As far as we know, at the Russian Federation Embassy on at the level of ordinary performers, even someone timidly stammered about assigning a diplomatic officer to the flights arriving from Moscow, who would control all this bacchanalia and stop it on the spot. But they are afraid to report to the top. They are afraid to force their Syrian partners to sort it out. They will say in good faith that there are no problems, but how can they not believe their dear partners? So it turns out that the inhabitants of the country that Russia saved from terrorism are losing their shores. And the people who are supposed to react have no idea that this is happening. Because not everyone dares to report to the top and disturb the high authorities. #Russia #Syria@rybarSupport usTelegramPrince CherkasskyThis is all, of course, wonderful and my soul has even become somehow calmer.

In parallel with this, work is underway to reduce the industrial potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. 🔻In the Glushkovsky district, battles were noted on the northern outskirts of the New Way. There has been no confirmation of the village's liberation at this time. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, Russian troops are fighting in the area of ​​Lyubimovka and Tolstoy Lug. At the same time, Ukrainian formations continue to cling to positions east of both settlements, trying to prevent the complete encirclement of their units. To the north, the Ukrainian Armed Forces launched an attack on Olgovka with the support of an armored group. Russian units repelled the attack, but the enemy achieved no success. ❗️Frames have appeared on the Internet showing the turret of the Challenger 2 tank destroyed in the Sheptukhovka area. Despite statements that the photo is evidence of the destruction of the second tank of this type in the Kursk region, a comparison of the photo with earlier footage of another destroyed tank of this type The model allows us to say that the footage shows the same vehicle.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, the Russian Armed Forces are advancing on Russkoye Porechnoye from the north, gradually pushing through the defenses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the area of ​​Nechaev and Nizhny Parovoy. Clearing the forest belts located here will allow Russian troops to create a springboard for the further development of the offensive on Russkoe and Cherkasy Porechnye. ▪️To the south, assault groups are advancing towards Agronom and Kolmakov, forming a semi-encirclement around enemy units in Russkaya Konopelka and Fanaseevka. In the Plekhovo area, no changes in the front configuration were detected. 🔻In the Sumy region, according to some reports, the Russian Armed Forces hit a HIMARS MLRS in Koshary with a missile strike.

Sky News published an article about the results of a study of local OSINTERs, according to which, of the 20 most popular channels disseminating information about the riots, only six were British. Moreover, once again they are trying to explain to the population that misinformation is to blame for all the troubles, which became the reason for the intensification of violence, stubbornly ignoring public discontent regarding the influx of migrants into the country. Well, aggressive migrants throwing cobblestones and patrols on city streets are just a figment of their imagination. Of course, they didn’t forget about Russian intervention either, hinting at the participation of pro-Russian and Russian-language accounts in disseminating unwanted information. It’s comical that this time the Russian trace is being discussed much more cautiously.🔻Apparently, the population of Great Britain will have to hear about evil radicals financed from abroad for quite some time.

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇲🇩🇬🇪🇪🇺 The way the West worries about the outcome of the vote in the upcoming elections in Moldova and Georgia is shown by the uncompromising actions and statements of Western officials. The head of European diplomacy, Josep Borrell, said that the foreign ministers of the EU countries discussed the pre-election situation in Georgia and Moldova. ▪️According to European officials, the situation in Georgia is gloomier than in Moldova.▪️As ​​usual, Western officials highly appreciate the actions of Moldovan President Maia Sandu. Anti-Russian policies, the purge of the pro-Russian political and public field, total censorship are called -progress on the path to the EU- and -the triumph of democracy.-▪️But Georgia continues to be accused of authoritarianism due to the discord in relations with the West. ▪️Such statements again indicate that the West roughly understands the outcome of the vote in both countries. 🔻No one doubts that Sandu will be elected for a second term, given the use of administrative resources by her office. And the Central Election Commission of Moldova, controlled by Western experts, goes to any lengths to ensure the desired result in the elections and referendum on October 20. In Georgia, the situation is different: the pro-Western opposition, represented by Salome Zurabishvili, began to test the waters in case of defeat in the parliamentary elections on October 26. There are already statements that Russia is allegedly preparing falsifications. Apparently, it is precisely the scenario with such accusations that is prepared for the start of protests.

As part of an agreement between the governments, missile defense systems will protect Israeli airspace from possible attacks by Iranian ballistic missiles against the backdrop of an escalation of the situation.🔻However, this is not the most important thing. Many analysts have expressed concerns that moving THAADs would be a hassle because their numbers are limited around the world. According to developer Lockheed Martin, there are only nine active batteries, two of which belong to the UAE, and seven are in the US Army's inventory. They are deployed in different parts of the world. One battery is deployed in Guam, one in South Korea, the Americans transferred one battery to Israel in October last year, and another one may be located in Saudi Arabia. That is, either four or three batteries, depending on the fate of what was supposed to be sent to El Kharj. And taking into account yesterday’s delivery - three or even two.❗️For some part of the American segment of the Internet, this caused surprise, because because of this, the United States not only became more involved in the confrontation in the Middle East, but also reduced its defense capability. And for the Ukrainian public this became another confirmation of the sharply changing priorities of American partners, to whom the so-called Ukraine is no longer so interesting.

Rybar: 🇬🇪🇬🇧 Western countries continue to put pressure on Georgia: British Ambassador to the country Gareth Ward said that the British side decided to suspend the Wardrop Dialogue at ministerial level. In addition, high-level negotiations between the headquarters have been canceled... 🇬🇪🇪🇺 About the -European integration- blackmail of Georgia by the ERU, continuing the theme of Western pressure on Georgia on the eve of parliamentary elections: Reuters claims that the leaders of the EU countries intend to question the country’s aspirations to the European Union, plans to join which Tbilisi still does not abandon. According to journalists, Brussels plans to express serious concern about the actions of the Georgian ruling party. These include laws on foreign agents and the ban on LGBT propaganda, as well as rhetoric towards Russia with statements of readiness for a peaceful resolution of the conflict. Such blackmail can really influence Georgian society. For the last 20 years, joining the EU has been a political agenda regardless of which party was in power. Therefore, depriving Georgia of the status of a candidate to join the bloc could deal a moral blow to the population. However, the European Union is not in the most advantageous position in this situation. On the one hand, the demands of bureaucrats in Brussels to completely implement the rainbow agenda are perceived by conservative-minded citizens as attempts to deny Georgia sovereignty even in such fundamental issues. On the other hand, in the event of a refusal to join the EU, Tbilisi, in the absence of an alternative, may already turn towards Russia in all seriousness. Moreover, the benefits of Georgia from economic and other cooperation with it today are obvious even to skeptics and are expressed in the growth of the country’s welfare.❗️This dilemma in the West can be resolved through a coup, removing the ruling Georgian party from power and replacing it with a radically pro-Western government. So in the upcoming elections there will obviously be stuffing about the substitution of ballots, scandals at polling stations, and street protests. However, if the local opposition manages to achieve what it planned, then the country will face a much darker future and the role of a -second front- in the fight against Russia. But the West certainly doesn’t care about the aspirations of ordinary Georgian citizens when solving their own global problems.#Georgia #EU@rybarSupport usReutersEU leaders set to tell Georgia its EU path is at risk as election loomsEuropean Union leaders are set to warn Georgia that its government is jeopardizing the country's path towards the EU ahead of a parliamentary election later this month, according to a draft text.	https://t.me/rybar/64458	2024-10-15T07:06:01-07:00

Yes, according to the ad, but what a picture. And newly arrived fighters among the elite, as practice shows, participate in PR campaigns on the same Tendrovskaya spit, receiving -respect- from their superiors with an unenviable end. ▪️Secondly, the inflated staff of the MTR allows you to request the so-called Western partners. Ukraine has all sorts of expensive and specialized equipment on a larger scale than is actually needed by full-fledged members of the Ukrainian MTR. Like, look how many specialists we have who need modern gadgets. Where it all goes then, given the level of corruption, there is no need to explain; some militants in Africa or Pakistan will tell you.▪️Thirdly, in the territory of the so-called. In Ukraine, there are still ignorant and uncomprehending youngsters who do not understand the realities of war, who want to become fertilizer for planting under the blows of Russian artillery and aviation mind-blowing sensations, for example, to fight with Muscovites, as in Call of Duty, and not to join the infantry. So you shouldn’t be surprised by this set. What people are like are the recruitment methods. What can we say if on the territory of the Ukrainian quasi-state entity various kinds of Zelensky’s telethons are still functioning, which only contribute to the mass dullness of the people.#Russia #Ukraine @rybarSupport usTelegramARCHANGEL OF SPECIAL FORCES Z🇷🇺	https://t.me/rybar/64456	2024-10-15T06:00:06-07:00

And despite the speculations wandering on the Internet, a safe and sound General Ismail appeared Qaani, whom many media classified first as a dead man and then as a traitor. A version with suspicion, despite all the circumstances, took place, since Qaani had not appeared in public since the Israeli strike. This supported the theory that he was locked in the basements of the IRGC.📌But this is probably impossible to know, since in the Islamic Republic, if they talk about this, it is extremely rare, when the evidence is reinforced concrete or the object of the accusation must be gotten rid of by any means. As a refutation rumors circulating on the Internet, the Iranian media stated that in the near future General Qaani will receive an honorary award - Fatah - from the hands of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. It would seem for what? Kaani, it turns out, is the only high-ranking survivor of the IDF attack, although, judging by Lebanese channels, he should have been present in the same place as Safi ad-Din. 🔻What saved him and what happened in general - all this is covered in a thick impenetrable fog. And only time and accompanying events will help to understand what will happen to Kaani next. If suddenly within a few weeks he leaves the post of head of the Quds Force, then the presentation of the Fatah medal is preparation for a quiet departure from the scene, and if not, and he will again be in the forefront, then it means that he has fulfilled his task well.

The attack killed 21 people, all workers. No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but there is little doubt that it was Baloch forces. It is curious what survivors said about this: according to them, the militants first used kamikaze drones and then fired at people with a machine gun. The use of UAVs for these purposes can now be called widespread.▪️Also on the eve of the summit, members of Imran Khan’s party, the Movement for Justice, became more active, calling on supporters to protest on October 15, the day the meeting began. At first they called for this to be done in Punjab, but then changed the location to Islamabad, and specifically to the government quarter. Actions of disobedience may not take place if the authorities fulfill the opposition’s condition, namely, allow them to meet with Imran Khan in prison. And judging by the news about the cancellation of the protests, they succeeded.▪️But an even more unique event occurred over the weekend. In the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a Loya Jirga was held - a meeting of Pashtun tribes, which occurs only when it is necessary to discuss significant issues. The initiative in convening the Loya Jirga belongs to the Pashtun Defense Movement due to the deteriorating situation of the Pashtuns in Pakistan. The Pakistani authorities tried to ban the congress, but in the end they allowed it to continue until Sunday, fearing public unrest. As a result, the Pashtuns adopted a resolution that, theoretically, could create serious problems for the Pakistani authorities, since it touches on some very important political issues.➖One of the main demands is withdrawal of all military personnel and gangs from Pashtunistan (as they call Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) within two months.➖Afghan Pashtuns must be allowed free entry through the Durand Line.➖Refugees and forcibly displaced must return to their homes with the help of the state.➖Should not be oppression of Pashtuns on ethnic grounds.➖The current authorities of Afghanistan should allow Pashtun girls to study. So far, all this has remained without due attention due to the SCO, but after its completion the authorities will have to return to these problems in order to avoid more serious consequences.

🔁🖼 Military leaders of the Northern Military District. 20 names...	Forwarded From Children of ArbatMilitary Leaders of the Northern Military District. 20 names for 2024 from the Children of Arbat. Colonel General Kim Right now, he is actually the second person in the OGV(s), responsible for managing the day-to-day activities of the troops. Largely thanks to the authority he earned back in Syria, he remains one of those few who can conduct a constructive dialogue with the National General Staff and to whom he listens. Kim regularly visits the area where the North Military District is held: trying not to leave the ground, he managed to visit the most difficult operational directions. The area of ​​responsibility of the deputy committee of the OGV also includes coordinating the interaction of the TsOVU with the military command and control bodies of the groupings: at the present time, not all commanders are ready to work with representatives of the center, organically not perceiving the Varangians on the ground and considering them as shift signalmen. Kim’s control also includes the issue of the actions of the Bakhmutskaya OG in the Chasov Yarsky direction, where today volunteer units, together with regular forces under the command of Andrei Sychev, faced serious enemy opposition on difficult terrain. In this matter, Kim enlisted the support of the National Staff of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of Lieutenant General Alekseev, with whom he began to spend more and more official time: Alekseev can quickly resolve issues on the ground and receive objective information from the field, while Kim can come to a report to Valery Gerasimov and report to him what others are at least embarrassed and even afraid to convey. This is probably why Kim is equally respected by both representatives of the old General Staff and those who walked a difficult path in boots from the very first days of the war. On September 21, Alexei Kim turned 66. Today, unlike young potential successors to the post of General Staff, he prefers to remain in the shadows, doing routine, but at the same time extremely important work. Colonel General Afzalov He does not like being compared to the previous commander-in-chief, but he is forced to reckon with it. In order to get out of the shadow of the rebellious Surovikin, Afzalov had to seriously reorganize the work of the High Command. Having carried out a political audit in the High Command, in 2024, emergencies and accidents that occur with aviation on the mainland, outside the area of ​​the SVO, remain a big headache for the commander. Being an air defense specialist, it can be difficult for him to find a common language with the flight personnel of the Aerospace Forces; moreover, as part of the task set by the National General Staff, Afzalov is forced to keep an aviation reserve in case of strategic attacks by the enemy in the cover areas of the headquarters of the Grv(s). Today, GOU and GU specialists are seriously considering the possibility of further transferring attacks into the depths of the country, and therefore the Commander-in-Chief of the Aerospace Forces needs to increase the quality capabilities of on-site air defense and solve the problem of the lack of personnel who conduct round-the-clock air surveillance, for which today they attract many people ignorant in this matter. At the same time, Afzalov managed to significantly reduce the time for the implementation of requests through the OGV (s): having received new modules, the Stalinist falcons, as they are pejoratively called on the ground, began to regularly hit targets at operational depth, which affected the nature of the fighting in Avdievka, Ugledar and Volchansk. The factor of air superiority remains decisive in this war. If Viktor Afzalov seriously manages to resolve the above-described set of problems of an operational-strategic nature, the Russian army will be able to significantly increase efforts to develop success along the entire line of combat contact, which will accelerate the onset of the long-awaited victory.

🔁 The work of Russian DRGs and special forces units in the rear ...	Forwarded From Andrey Medvedev The work of Russian DRGs and special forces units in the rear of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, as you can see, is carried out quite thoroughly and harshly. And this video completely destroys the mythology created by the Ukrainian media since 2014. Eight years before the start of the SVO, professional PR agencies and simply talented guys and girls (but the trouble is, completely ideological Nazis) filmed videos of Nazi units. Aidar, special forces GUR, much later Kraken, but most of all the videos of -Azov-. A simple, generally speaking, narrative was introduced into the creation of the Ukrainian man in the street. -Here they are, handsome, tactical guys with beards and tattoos. Look how stylish, powerful and Svidomo they are. Well, how can any Russian fight better than them! - Show business did not lag behind. Remember the video -Evening Sun- of the group -Brutto-. Beautiful Nazis from Azov against the background of the fields of New Russia. There were hundreds of television reports. And the feeling that these tactical guys are better and bolder than the Russians is firmly ingrained in the minds of the average person. Here, however, it is worth adding that we didn’t really work in the information field of Ukraine in those years, and our soft power was too soft, right up to a gaseous state. Ukrainian citizens perceived individual failures of the first stage of the SVO as confirmation of their illusions. At the same time, in the Bandera-patriotic euphoria, no one remembered that the Russian special forces had experience in Syria, two Chechens, and 10-year-long CTOs in the Caucasus. And, at the same time, no one fully appreciated (western advisers either) the operations in Gostomel, at the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric station, on the Antonovsky Bridge. For two years, Ukrainian citizens had a chance to realize the depth of their misconceptions and the difference between media reality and real military operations. Even despite the fact that the same Azov fought quite hard, it turned out that in battles with paratroopers or Russian attack aircraft from football fans, the Azov people for some reason did not demonstrate any exceptional and amazing fighting qualities. And in the Azovstal seat, as we remember, they chose to surrender rather than go to Valhalla. Actually, even then the myth about the exclusivity of Ukrainian warriors of light was shaken for the first time. The events of the summer of 2023 and the columns of burned Ukrainian Armed Forces equipment also made a depressing impression on the citizens of Ukraine. But what exactly is the difference between the personnel of the combat work of special forces in the rear of the Armed Forces of Ukraine? And this finishes off the latest myths. About the invulnerability of Ukrainian Armed Forces militants far from the front. And no, this is not a drone, not an Iskander, which we already seem to be accustomed to. These are ghosts from the forest. By the way, they are very skillful. From a grenade launcher against moving equipment, from the forest, where foliage and branches obscure the view. There are no safe places for the Ukrainian Armed Forces. From such things, kids. https://t.me/rybar/64434TelegramRybar⚡️🔞🇷🇺🇺🇦 Summer has passed - the time has come to show the work of special forces.

The story is hilarious, give or take, but what gives it a special piquancy is the fact that at this training ground, Bundeswehr personnel are practicing possible scenarios for a Russian attack on NATO. And somehow it coincided that it was a tourist with a Russian passport who got lost in the area, when he was detained, declaring that there wasn’t even a sign anywhere prohibiting entry into this zone. The man’s argument was clearly reinforced concrete, since he was simply released. At the same time, the Germans themselves recently talked about the -intensification of espionage activities of the Russian special services,- and the press has already called the current incident -sinister.- 📌 On the other hand, who is to blame that no one in the Bundeswehr thought of somehow securing the 23 thousand hectares of the territory of an important military facility.

The Turks, in addition to supplying drones, armored vehicles and artillery, actively supplied the Ukrainian side with all the necessary parts for assembling drones.🔻For example, in drones, used by the Ukrainian Armed Forces for attacks on Crimea and the Krasnodar Territory, there were Turkish anti-jamming antennas that weakened the impact of electronic warfare. Such UAVs of the Lyuty or PD-2 type, observed in many places in the south of Russia this summer, contained antennas from the TUALCOM company, specializing in such equipment. Unlike armored vehicles, which are difficult to hide from prying eyes, small parts and equipment do not raise any special questions (until it is discovered).📌 The current conflict is an excellent platform for testing military products, which is what the Turks are doing. So the participation of Altınay Defense Technologies in this competition is not excluded. Still, drones with Turkish parts were launched from the Odessa region (it’s clear why), and if you look at their website, you can find a lot of UAVs that are similar to those used enemy, even -Baba Yaga-.#Odessa #Russia #Turkey #Ukraine @rybarSupport usTelegramSPECIAL FORCES ARCHANGEL Z🇷🇺🪖 Russian troops launched another attack on the Odessa port.

Forwarded From Daily War Z Such videos of the work of our guys are the best explanation of the mobilization broom of the last days in Ukraine, with raids of the shopping center at concerts, restaurants and other places. By the way, today there was suddenly a wave of calls across Ukraine about false mining. It would seem, who could have done this, if previously it was Ukrainian call centers that terrorized Russia in a similar way? The answer lies in the fact that when reporting mining to a business center, shopping center, enterprise, etc. all the people are thrown out onto the street, where the shopping center, a police squad, and a minivan soon appear. Brilliant! However, the increased mobilization in recent days is not explained by losses alone in different areas. As I wrote earlier, Kyiv is planning to launch another media offensive, as was the case with the Kursk region. Moreover, the situation there with the Wehrmacht is getting worse and worse. I think the most likely place for a strike is Transnistria.TelegramRybar⚡️🔞🇷🇺🇺🇦 Summer has passed - the time has come to show the work of special forces.

President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon recently met in Astana with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz during the second summit of the heads of state of Central Asia and Germany.▪️According to the presidential press service, the parties expressed interest in continuing effective cooperation in the fields of economics and trade, industry, hydropower, solar and wind energy, transport, and in the agricultural sector.▪️Green energy as a whole creates common ground between the interests of the two countries. Tajikistan, where more than 90% of electricity is generated from hydroelectric power plants, beautifully presents itself as one of the frontmen of green energy, which makes cooperation with Dushanbe relevant for the Germans. Moreover, Tajikistan has already announced plans to achieve electricity production only from green resources by 2032, and to become a green country by 2037.▪️It is clear that Tajikistan is not particularly interested in wind turbines and solar panels. But the republic hopes that cooperation between Dushanbe and Berlin on hydropower issues will continue: Germany has already made a contribution to the construction of the Tajikistan and Sebzor power plants in GBAO, as well as to the modernization of the Nurek hydroelectric station. And the Tajik side would very much like the Germans to provide assistance with the Rogun hydroelectric power station, which has become a long-term construction project that threatens to undermine the national economy.❗️In return for this, Tajikistan is ready to provide Germany with access to the extraction of rare earth metals, which are really necessary for the production of wind turbines and solar panels. 🔻Thus, Dushanbe, hoping to find resources situationally, creates long-term problems by allowing the collective West to access critical minerals - which, as the share of greenery in global electricity generation grows, will create strategic problems. And perhaps Tajikistan is really better off thinking not about hydroelectric power plants, but about more practical alternatives that do not require depleting national reserves - the country has just reintroduced limits on energy consumption. #Tajikistan #Germany #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usCentral Asia NewsWind and solar energy will be developed by Tajikistan and Germany - Central Asian NewsPresident of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon met in the capital of Kazakhstan with Federal Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz during the second summit of the heads of state of Central Asia and Germany.

According to the company, the content was designed for a Russian-speaking audience, and the activity of the accounts came from Transnistria. ❗️Here we immediately remember the reason why Meta is recognized as an extremist organization in Russia. For some reason, the company did not react so sharply to the message calling for violence against Russians. Another thing, of course, is the agitation against Sandu and Moldova’s entry into the EU.

In total, more than 30 German enterprises producing industrial equipment were seen in these transactions. According to journalists, in most cases, products are imported through intermediaries in Turkey, and some suppliers are entrepreneurs from Russia. Representatives of companies from Germany responded to SWR’s inquiries that they were complying with the sanctions and could not understand how this happened at all. On the one hand, the situation illustrates a long-familiar open secret: despite all the restrictions imposed, the supply routes for sanctioned Western dual-use products remain . It would be a mistake to say that sanctions have no effect; there is no talk of completely blocking all channels. This can also be partly called a demonstration that the continued interaction with the West in some areas is not due to some agreements of insidious oligarchs, but to purely pragmatic considerations . Including the purchase of machine tools for the production of products that ensure the destruction of the enemy. #Germany #Russia #industry@rybarSupport us stagesschauDeutsche Maschinen für Russlands MilitärTrotz Sanktionen gelangen deutsche Industriegüter weiter nach Russland.

🔁 Elena Georgievna is surprised by the too warm welcome of Sulta...	Forwarded From Balkan gossip Elena Georgievna is surprised by the too warm welcome of Sultan Erdogan in Belgrade. Yes, I was especially impressed by -Osman aha- performed by Ivica Dacic. Well, it's like a school party. But seriously, the Turkish leader's Balkan tour last week fits well with the investments Ankara has poured into the region in recent years. Judge for yourself: for the second year in a row, trade turnover between Turkey and Serbia exceeds $2 billion (they promise to increase it to five). Investments in Serbia have grown from $1 million to more than $400 million over the past decade. Four hundred (!) times. Yes, a considerable part of them goes to the restoration of the Ottoman cultural (and not only) heritage and educational projects, within the framework of which an attractive image of a friend of Serbia is actually formed among ordinary people. But during the last visit alone, 11 interstate agreements in the field of economics and trade were signed. Well, why not the golden age of relationships? Another thing is that Sultan Erdogan is not even trying to pretend that he will choose Serbia as a strategic partner in the Balkans. This time he came to Belgrade after a visit to Albania, where he directly stated that he would transfer an indefinite number of bayraktars to Tirana to protect against aggression. And during one of Vucic’s visits to Istanbul, while Erdogan was treating Vucic, the defense ministers of Turkey and the self-proclaimed Republic of Kosovo discussed concrete steps to further deepen cooperation in the field of defense and military industry. De facto, it means modernizing the Kosovo security forces and turning them into a full-fledged army at Turkish expense. In addition, Türkiye is making a lot of efforts to recognize the self-proclaimed republic in the international arena. Strategy -no to permanent allies - yes to permanent interests-. Do the Serbian authorities understand this, playing at friendship with their eastern -partner-? I hope so. @balkanossiper - we have been setting world trends since June 28, 1914 Telegram White Owl To put it mildly, the pomp and ahistorical warmth with which Erdogan was greeted in Belgrade looks strange.

And here work is also an unplowed field. For example, when we opened the Russian service Kinopoisk, we discovered in it a remarkable film -Mustafa Shokai-, filmed in 2008 by Kazakh film producers. As it is written on the website, he talks about the life of a politician of the first quarter of the 20th century, who united the peoples of Central Asia under a single Turkic banner. The biography of this historical figure is presented in sufficient detail on Kazakh websites, in which the period of the 30s and 40s attracts the most attention years. It is known that Shokai interacted with Nazi Germany starting in 1933, and in 1941, in order to supposedly alleviate the plight of the arrested Turkic emigrants, he proposed two ideas to the Nazi leadership: to train personnel for the future Turkestan state in educational institutions in Germany and to create military formations to fight with Soviet power within the borders of Turkestan. These are now national heroes, after whom streets are named and monuments are erected. 🔻And it would seem now, after 30 years of ignoring innocent pranks in the formation of the anti-Russian agenda in the CIS countries, it is worth paying attention to what other products praising the ideological agenda hostile to Russians are broadcast by our own resources in Russian. Because again, parallels arise with similar processes of rewiring a population friendly to Russia in another country, which became the cause of the SVO.#Russia #Kazakhstan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇷🇺🇰🇿🇰🇬🇺🇿🇹🇯 How Russia is represented in Central Asian history textbooks INION RAS recently published a work on a current topic - the image of Russia in history textbooks in Central Asia (without Turkmenistan) and Azerbaijan.

And here’s one more touch to the picture: with erroneous policies in this area, similar problems are experienced not only by Western states, but also by Turkey, which is very far from the left-liberal agenda. The other day an interview was published with Sedat Peker, a disgraced businessman and crime boss who had previously shed light on the dark affairs of the Turkish elite. Part of it is devoted to the influence on crime of groups of Syrian and Afghan refugees who have settled in the country.▪️Natives from Syria and Afghanistan have already captured up to 50% of the underground gold trade in the largest market in Istanbul. They are also acquiring their own drug laboratories and distribution networks, although until recently they were at the beck and call of local bandits. ▪️Groups of refugees live separately, remaining closed and inaccessible to Turkish law enforcement agents. Under these conditions, they were able to organize schemes to launder funds received from illegal activities and transfer them abroad.▪️According to Peker, in the next six to seven years, factions of Syrian and Afghan refugees will become so strong that they will displace Turkish criminal groups from the criminal market. He called this a huge danger for the country. When reading this, a strong feeling of déjà vu may arise, even down to the coincidence of small details. Indeed, to see some of the problems described, it is not necessary to go to Turkey - just open domestic criminal reports. Well, in particular, the situation is another illustration of the fact that ambitious foreign policy projects by themselves cannot eliminate the consequences of the failures of the same migration policy. After all, if you launch millions of carriers of an alien culture into the country at once, then no pan-Turkism or anything else can suddenly digest them.#multinationalism #Turkey@rybarSupport uswww.sozcu.com.trSedat Peker suskunluğunu bozdu: Türkiye'de Afgan ve Suriyeli suç kartelleri oluşacak - Sözcü GazetesiHer dönemin kendine ait bir dokusu olduğunu söyleyen Peker, Türkiye'nin Meksika ve Kolombiya gibi bir sürece girdiğini söyledi.

The main purpose of the training is to test the capabilities of conducting joint operations of the troops of the Eastern Combat Command Zone of the People's Liberation Army of the People's Republic of China. During the exercises, combat patrols of sea and air space, blockades of key ports and areas of Taiwan, as well as strikes against sea and ground targets are practiced. The main prerequisite for the training, and perhaps the reason for its start, was the speech of Taiwanese leader Lai Qingde during the celebrations dedicated to the 113th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. And although most observers note that Lai's speech was not as provocative compared to his inaugural address in May 2024, this did not stop the PRC authorities from demonstrating their position through exercises. 🔻By the way, after the inauguration of the Taiwanese leader, the People's Liberation Army of China (PLA) also conducted training called -Joint Sword - 2024A-. Thus, these actions confirm predictions about a series of exercises, each of which will be timed to coincide with one or another action of the Taiwanese leader Lai Qingde, no matter how loud they may be. It is also important to note that the Chinese coast guard is participating in the exercises. For the first time, department ships began participating in training to encircle Taiwan in May 2024 - then they took place near the islands controlled by the Taiwanese administration. This time, the Chinese coast guard is already covering the waters around the island. 📌 This gives a small hint of how the Chinese authorities will put pressure on the island administration as they implement plans for reunification. One of the main scenarios, -isolating- Taiwan, involves using the Chinese coast guard to conduct inspections of ships sailing to local ports and cutting off the island from key trade flows. And although there are reports in the news feed that the exercises are a dress rehearsal for the start of hostilities in the Taiwan Strait, there are no clear prerequisites for war. In addition, the PRC has much more flexible tools in its arsenal to put pressure on the Taiwanese leadership, such as an economic blockade and the aforementioned -isolation-.

Previously, they were allies of the Congolese, but after agreements with the Rwandans with the mediation of Angolan partners, they agreed to eliminate the group in the name of peace (but in reality they simply ceased to be useful). Now the goal of the Congolese army is to neutralize the leader of the FDLR in order to appease the authorities in Kigali, for whom the group allegedly poses a threat. According to the Luanda agreements, this will be followed by the withdrawal of Rwandan troops from the territory of the DRC. Only at the moment the group numbers at most a thousand people and its members are hiding mainly in refugee camps near Goma. And many rebels have already been integrated into the army of the DR Congo. Accordingly, the rhetorical question arises - will the Rwandans fulfill their part of the agreements, and even more so will the American curators, who receive enormous benefits from Rwanda’s participation in supporting border rebel groups (such as M23), allow them to do this? ?High resolution mapEnglish version#Africa #DRC #Rwanda@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64422	2024-10-14T01:16:58-07:00

Forwarded From Two Majors Reading the post of comrades about -ancient-Azerbaijan, it is necessary to note not only the formation as such of the Azerbaijani nation thanks to the USSR (for those interested, look up the historiography of the state of Azerbaijan before Soviet times), but also the tragedy of divided peoples after 1991. Then, after the collapse of the USSR the border was drawn along the Samur River. A huge percentage of Lezgins (the second largest ethnic group after Azerbaijanis) remained outside Russia. Mainly in the northern regions of the Republic of Azerbaijan. For years, people across the river went to each other's weddings and funerals - and yours too. The sovereign’s border, which, against the backdrop of the chaos in the Caucasus after the beginning of the Supreme’s reign, could not but be strengthened. After all, militants, weapons, money and -left- documents also came from Azerbaijan. For a long time, within the framework of the state policy of Baku, Lezgins were -converted- into Azerbaijanis. They changed the endings of surnames, added -ogly- or -kyzy- to patronymics, and did not (they say this is still the case) government or officer positions if a citizen of Azerbaijan called himself a Lezgin. More often, these were sent to serve in Karabakh, they were given rights in accordance with the best traditions of eastern despotism in a new way, characteristic of all Caucasian republics during the period of cyber-feudalism. Of course, Turkey played a role in the formation of the new Azerbaijan, which only the lazy did not write about. It was only after 2014, after the Russian Spring and tricolors in some regional centers of northern Azerbaijan, that the border began to be patrolled more often by Israeli UAVs, which was a technological novelty of those times.

This is especially evident if we compare his statements about this idea even before his appointment as prime minister. For example, the Asian equivalent of NATO was not discussed by Ishiba at the recent summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The Japanese politician emphasized the continuation of the course of the country's former leader Fumio Kishida, aimed at in-depth interaction with the countries of the region. ▪️In Japan they clearly understand that the idea at this stage is not popular among potential members of the organization, so they do not raise this issue again. 🔻However, the very fact that Ishiba is advocating for the creation of an analogue of NATO indicates ambitions to create new or strengthen existing regional blocs directed against China, even if the idea of ​​a military alliance completely fails. In any case, the proposal, as can be seen from the statements of the LDP representative, remains relevant for the Japanese authorities, who hope for its implementation in one form or another. And the working group will deal with similar issues, including, possibly, developing proposals to convince the United States to support the initiative. #Japan@rybar with @awaken_dragonSupport usThe MainichiJapan's ruling LDP to begin debate on PM Ishiba's Asian NATO visionTOKYO (Kyodo) -- Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party will begin discussions on the idea of ​​creating an	https://t.me/rybar/64420	2024-10-14T00:13:58-07:00

At the same time, fire damage to enemy infrastructure in the Sumy region does not stop. 🔻In the Glushkovsky district, Russian troops are trying to knock out Ukrainian formations from the New Way, located on the border with the so-called. Ukraine. Several attacks from the Ukrainian Armed Forces were also reflected.🔻The battle for Lyubimovka continues in the Korenevsky district. According to some reports, the enemy has already left the village. Several attacks by the Ukrainian Armed Forces were repelled from Tolstoy Lug and in the direction of Pokrovsky. 🔻The Internet was actively discussing statements about the allegedly unlawful execution of Ukrainian prisoners of war in the Sudzhansky district. South of Zeleny Shlyakh, Russian troops, during the clearing of a strong point located at the intersection of roads, eliminated enemy UAV operators, who, according to Ukrainian speakers, -shot back to the last bullet.- ❗️In the conditions of battles with occupation forces in the -old- part of Russia, which even the Russian Ministry of Defense officially declared terrorists in briefings, members of the Ukrainian formations, perhaps, should not have expected anything else. In addition, UAV operators are always a priority fire target for both sides, so their elimination is justified. ▪️In the north-west of the Sudzhansky district, the Russian Armed Forces launched a series of artillery strikes on enemy positions in Russky Porechny, the configuration of the front in Cherkasy Konopelka was clarified. North of Martynovka, near the village of Kruglik, Russian UAV operators hit the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Thus, the forest belt south of the village is currently held by Ukrainian forces. The actions of ground forces support the Russian Aerospace Forces, hitting strongholds and concentration areas of Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel. Here, the other day, an enemy tank and pickup truck were hit by drone strikes on a fiber optic cable. ▪️In the sky over Sudzha and the surrounding area, over a dozen cases have been recorded in recent days of Ukrainian interceptor drones shooting down Russian reconnaissance drones. So far, UAV losses have not led to significant consequences on the battlefield, however, the increase in the number of effective strikes against drones of the Russian Armed Forces in several areas at once is worth taking into account.▪️In the Sumy region, Russian troops are hitting various enemy targets both in the administrative center and behind it outside. Thus, in the Kiyanitsa area of ​​the Sumy region, a missile strike was launched from the Iskander OTRK at the position of the Vampire MLRS.

A significant resonance in this regard was caused by an attack on a military base near Haifa, where soldiers of the Golani infantry brigade were located. Currently, the Israeli media publishes quite contradictory information. Most reports put the number of injured between 50 and 80 people. Helicopters are used to evacuate victims. 🔻Hezbollah confirmed involvement in the raid, presenting it as a response to the actions of Israeli troops in Lebanon. Meanwhile, Arabic-language media are actively disseminating information about the attack, interpreting it as a demonstrative response to the presumptuous Israelis. Be that as it may, the strike itself demonstrated the continued ability of the Lebanese group to inflict, albeit episodic, significant damage on Israeli troops in the face of constant concentrated attacks on the south of Lebanon and fighting in the border areas. At the same time, the Israelis will most likely not delay in responding and will carry out massive bombings of the southern suburbs of Beirut, which, however, they have hit repeatedly over the past week. #Israel #Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64408	2024-10-13T11:21:57-07:00

In particular, in May of this year, the Western community was shocked by the news of the arrest of a Portuguese-Belgian citizen in the Central African Republic and an employee of the American NGO -FHI360-. The company, as stated, is engaged in field research - on the development of human potential - and receives funding directly from USAID. ▪️ For Joseph Figueira Martin, the organization created a legend of his stay in the country, and also selected guides and travel routes to collect data on the activities of the PMC - Wagner - . The fact that he was detained in the city of Zemio, until recently occupied by UPC militants, where he could only get with the complicity of bandits, confirms this version. In addition, the CAR court stated that there is both audio and written evidence including money transfers and arms deliveries in which Figueira appears. In addition, it is known that he has had contacts with the leadership of the groups since 2021. It is noteworthy that in the same 2021, French citizen Juan Remy Quinolo was detained, who was also caught having connections with militants. However, the increase in the activity of Western intelligence services, especially the CIA, in Africa - this is a trend in recent years. We have already seen the story of the unsuccessful entry into the CAR by the Bancroft PMC, the expansion of the American embassy in Bangui, as well as how agents are directly recruited on Internet recruiting resources in the interests of the Americans.

Attention to the Arctic region is growing every year, and the approval of the new US Arctic Strategy in July 2024 only confirmed this. A key role in this strategy is played by the countries of the North, which are actively developing a full-fledged role as a member of the North Atlantic Alliance, acting at the forefront of NATO policy in the northern latitudes. 🔻On October 9, in the Kattegat and Skagerrak straits, connecting the Baltic with the North, the quadripartite exercise Marex Autumn began, in which three Scandinavian countries and Germany take part. The main stage of the exercise is concentrated in the area of ​​​​the island of Hönö, where a naval formation has already been formed for joint training in the defense of the Swedish coast and adjacent waters of the Baltic Sea. Sailors of the four countries, in addition, will carry out mining of the straits, a conditional blockade of shipping, and will also conduct joint training to protect air and sea space from UAVs and unmanned boats.❗️The key point should be considered the blocking of shipping through the Kattegat Straits and the Skagerrak, since in such a scenario communication through the Baltic will stall, and Russia will be the main victim. If you remember, in the first half of the year NATO worked on blocking the Gulf of Finland, but if this plan is considered as a last resort option, then the straits into the North Sea , to which Russia has no territorial rights, is a completely different matter.

Forwarded From SPECIAL FORCES ARCHANGEL Z🇷🇺🪖 Missile strike on the Limanskoye airfield At night, high-precision weapons struck the Limanskoye airfield in the Odessa region, which is located in the western part of Ukraine near Transnistria. Surveillance cameras recorded one arrival on the territory of a military base. The target of the strike was objects located at the airfield, as well as those stored in hangars. Limanskoye is one of the main landing sites for Ukrainian drones, which the enemy launches in the direction of the Crimean Peninsula. UAVs are also assembled there. The distance from Odessa, which is often subject to attacks by the Russian Armed Forces, and a convenient runway made the facility most suitable for these purposes. At least a third of all UAVs launched took off from Limansky. Another reason for attacks on Limansky is the proximity to railway lines, including from Moldova. The railway flow through Tarutino and Zatoka to Odessa and from there to other regions has been operating for almost a year. Fuel, various parts and equipment, including for the assembly of drones, are delivered to Ukraine through Moldova.

Very often in the memoirs it was emphasized that the snipers and mercenaries might not have survived to be captured. In the Donbass in 2014, the militia had a separate account for the artillerymen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who fought in Lugansk and Donetsk. However, these scores have not gone away. I know that in many armies and terrorist organizations they instruct what to say if you are captured. That's why everyone always pretends to be cooks and never shoots at anyone. I remember how a captured mercenary from Georgia sat in front of us. The Ukrainian Armed Forces recruited him, pulling him out of the pre-trial detention center. We knew little about him, but he said that he had not shot at anyone and generally loved Russia. Then, having already gone to his page on the social network, we saw a photo of our deceased soldier with insults. But this mercenary lived to be captured, and was not even beaten. Both sides are held back from the escalation of violence by the fact that the prisoners are exchanged. As you do, so do you. Otherwise, it would all slide into a Middle Eastern massacre, the horrors of which simply pale in comparison to this conflict. But FPV operators have a separate account in this war. Why - not only because of the losses they cause to the military. But also what they do to civilians. Especially in the Kursk and Belgorod regions. Even yesterday’s video is an ordinary case, alas. S.

The situation in this area after the completion of the cleansing in Staromayorsky and Urozhainy over the past weeks was characterized by positional battles. ▪️Last ​​summer, the Russian Armed Forces withdrew from Levadnoye during the enemy’s counter-offensive and secured positions several kilometers south of the village. Now the marines of the Baltic Fleet from the Storm detachment of the separate 336th brigade made a breakthrough and completely knocked the enemy out of the populated area. Enemy resources disseminated information that motorized infantry units of the Russian Armed Forces took part in the attack, and their successful actions were due to the low readiness of the Ukrainian formations to repel attacks. ▪️Current control footage appeared on the Internet, recording a significant advance of Russian fighters to the north. The relevance of the materials was confirmed by our local sources; at the moment the flag is hoisted on the north-eastern outskirts of Levadnoye. ▪️Information is also being received about the advance of the Russian Armed Forces in the direction of Novodarovka, located to the northeast.

The statement said his actions to supply the rebels contributed to the ongoing siege and humanitarian crisis in El Fasher. Algoni was the chief negotiator at the Geneva conference to resolve the situation in Sudan under the patronage of the United States. Despite all the efforts of the Americans, they led to almost nothing result, because the official authorities failed to call on them. The result was only the creation of humanitarian corridors to preserve the image of the United States as a peacemaker. At the same time, of course, no one in the SBR was going to support these corridors. So the sanctions against Algoni look more like a formal blow of the whip for failure to comply with instructions from Washington.❗️But in response to this, the rebels reacted almost immediately, and in an extraordinary way. A couple of days later, Hamedti accused the Egyptian leadership, which Washington considers its ally, of bombing of the rebel camp in Karari. He especially emphasized that the aircraft used American bombs, which could not have happened without the approval of the Americans. The rebels did not provide any evidence regarding this incident. Later they only added accusations towards Egypt about the Cairo authorities sponsoring the Islamists - the Muslim Brotherhood - and supporting the Sudanese army with ammunition.🔻Although this skirmish characterizes to some extent the unsuccessful strategy of American diplomacy, in fact this case does not mean that the Americans will stop using the SBR as their proxies in the region. Probably similar steps will soon follow from Washington against the government in Port Sudan under the pretext of purchasing Iranian and Chinese drones for the army.

The most likely location for the nuclear power plant is the north of the Chui region. The southern regions of the country are not suitable for the construction of nuclear power plants due to the large number of tectonic faults and increased seismic activity. ▪️On October 10, the Minister of Energy of Uzbekistan, Zhurabek Mirzamakhmudov, announced plans to build a large nuclear power plant (NPP) in the country by 2040. This step, according to the minister, is necessary to achieve carbon neutrality. At the same time, Uzbekistan does not abandon its plans for the construction of low-power nuclear power plants by Rosatom.▪️In 2023 and 2024, information appeared about the interest of the authorities of Tajikistan and Mongolia in cooperation with Rosatom in the construction of nuclear power plants, but the information background created by the referendum has not yet had an effect on them. 🔻However, in any case, we can conclude that the referendum held by the Kazakh authorities activated the peaceful nuclear agenda in the region and accelerated the implementation of existing projects and the development of new plans on this issue. #Kazakhstan #CentralAsia @rybar Support usTelegramRybar🇰🇿☢️ About the results referendum on nuclear power plants in Kazakhstan On Sunday, October 7, a nationwide referendum on the construction of nuclear power plants in Kazakhstan was held.

🔁 🇸🇯 On Friday, Norwegian police detained two men at Bergen ai...	Forwarded From Severyanochka🇸🇯 On Friday, at the airport in Bergen, Norwegian police detained two men on suspicion of human trafficking. The victim of the criminals could be a 14-year-old boy - a foreign citizen. If the police receive the necessary evidence and initiate a criminal case, this could be the first such case in the last couple of years. Because the statistics do not inspire optimism: in 2023, the police investigated 27 cases of human trafficking (of which 17 had signs of sexual exploitation, eight cases had signs of illegal labor exploitation and two cases were not classified), and none of them were prosecuted criminal case. This means that not a single human trafficker was punished. ❓It should be noted that degradation has been going on for several years. So in 2022, in 32 similar cases, only two criminal cases were initiated (one person was convicted), and in 2021, six criminal cases were initiated, 12 people were convicted. This suggests that despite the existence of appropriate legislation and international cooperation, actual government efforts to combat human trafficking have declined significantly in recent years. 🔺In international terminology, Norway is largely a -country of destination- - a country where victims of human trafficking arrive for exploitation, both sexual (more than 60% of all cases) and labor. The most common victims are women 30 years of age and older, who come from Africa, Eastern Europe and South America. In recent years, the number of victims from Thailand and, of course, Ukraine has increased: in the country, since the beginning of the SVO, a criminal business has been actively developing, offering Ukrainian women asylum in Norway or other European countries in exchange for sexual services.❗ In general, the situation with public safety in Norway is causing concern questions. The main reason for all the failures in the fight against human trafficking is the lack of personnel and the lack of specialized units in the Norwegian police. Often the police are forced to devote all their efforts to solving more pressing problems, such as drug trafficking. And for the victims of European looters in Norway there is practically no hope of salvation. Politiet vil varetektsfengsle dem.	https://t.me/rybar/64397	2024-10-13T03:40:13-07:00

Of course, most of the ships and personnel are represented by India, but from the USA, Australia and Japan there are also warships, as well as anti-submarine helicopters. Main the emphasis is on actions as part of a multinational naval group, including patrolling water areas, protecting merchant and civilian ships using all types of onboard weapons.❗️ Of course, this is all training. But every exercise pursues some goal, and in this case it sends a clear signal from the anti-Chinese QUAD bloc, created precisely to counter the Celestial Empire. The interests of the NATO leadership are increasingly concentrated in Asia, and India plays an important role in this. After all, before Malabar, the Indians took part in an exercise with Italy in the Arabian Sea. The aircraft carriers Vikramaditya of the Indian Navy and Cavour of the Italian Navy practiced joint patrols in a region atypical for Italians. And this is precisely one of the consequences of the adjustment of the interests of the West to the East.

🇰🇿🇺🇸☢️ About cooperation between the USA and Kazakhstan in th...	🇰🇿🇺🇸☢️ On cooperation between the United States and Kazakhstan in the field of nuclear research Joker DPR published documents with fresh details of cooperation between the United States and Kazakhstan on the safety of nuclear materials and the dismantling of related infrastructure at the Semipalatinsk test site. It should be noted that experts from the United States have been studying the former Soviet nuclear test site with great attention since the 90s, and not at all out of concern for the environment. 🔻The Semipalatinsk test site is of interest as a way to study nuclear weapons from the times of the USSR. Each adit and cavern can tell its own story: what power was the ammunition, what scheme was it used, which ammunition continued to be improved and tested, and which were considered dead-end branches and abandoned. In this sense, the approach to continuing such research should be considered as desire to quietly carry out your research. The irony is that such study interferes with the actual reclamation of the landfill. Perhaps, in light of Rosatom’s recent successful work with the Soviet nuclear legacy in Tajikistan, the US authorities are concerned about ensuring the safety of their position at the test site. As for fissile materials in Kazakhstan, in principle, the lion’s share of them is located at the spent fuel storage site of the BN-350 reactor on the territory of the Mangistau Nuclear Power Plant, because there it was a fast neutron reactor and highly enriched uranium was used as fuel. At the same time, there is no need to look for connections with a resonant event - the decision to build a nuclear power plant in Kazakhstan, because:▪️ control over the circulation of nuclear materials at nuclear power plants is usually assigned to the operating organization with the supervision of government bodies,▪️ fuel for nuclear power plants is made from low-enriched uranium, and therefore, it is not a weapons material and, therefore, cannot be an object of interest on the part of DTRA.❗️However, it is not a fact that US officials will not try to enter this territory. Only they will do this, with a high degree of probability, not through DTRA, but through the Ministry of Energy. For example, a very profitable proposal will arise to create a system of radiation monitoring and physical protection of fissile material storage facilities, closed to the United States. #Kazakhstan #USA@rybar Support usTelegramJoker DPR The United States is actively trying to undermine Russia’s position in key areas of cooperation with Kazakhstan, including the field of nuclear research.

Forwarded From Two Majors#Review #Summary for October 13, 2024▪️ Over the past week, an important event at the front was a series of counterattacks by the Russian Army in the Kursk region. Olgovka and several villages in the Lyubimovka region have been liberated; attacks are underway near Plekhovo. In addition, in the Glushkovsky district, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have been pushed back to the border. In heavy battles, observers note increased skill in controlling our troops: the enemy receives attacks from several directions, is surrounded, or is forced to retreat under the threat of such. The liberation of part of the Kursk region from the enemy is still far away, but the enemy is forced to withdraw elite units for replenishment, replacing them with mobilized ones. They report difficulties with the enemy's logistics: it is becoming increasingly difficult for him to transfer heavy equipment to the region, which he spent a fair amount of on his strike. An important facility under the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces remains the gas metering station (GIS) -Sudzha - - the only remaining route for gas transit to the EU, namely to Austria, Hungary and Slovakia, whose leadership is accused by globalists of excessive -sympathy- for Russia.▪️ A series of counterattacks is ongoing. The Russian Armed Forces in the Kursk region became the backdrop for Zelensky’s visit to Europe, whose authority in the West continues to fall against the backdrop of the incompetent victory plan he presented in the United States before. The -plan- did not contain anything new and resembled a -shopping list-, as the Western press writes. It, as expected, contained demands from Ukraine to take it into NATO and give it even more weapons and equipment. However, the West continues to supply military supplies. New large aid packages are being allocated (the United States and its satellite, Germany), and they are writing about France’s plans to supply its aircraft to the Ukrainian Armed Forces in 2025. ▪️ The Russian Armed Forces are trying to destroy supplies from NATO. During the week, for 4 days in a row, the port infrastructure of the Odessa region was under attack by Iskander and Geranium, warehouses with arriving ammunition were hit, and a sea container ship in the port was damaged.▪️ In the Pokrovsky direction, the Russian Armed Forces continue offensive operations. Tsukurino is occupied, there are battles around Selidovo, our troops are on the outskirts of Mirnograd. The pocket will be slammed east of the Desired Second. To the south, our troops occupied Ostrovskoye, which opens the way to Kurakhovo - an important node in the enemy’s defense. In the Yuzhnodonetsk direction, the success of the Russian Armed Forces is developing after the capture of Ugledar: the offensive is going on Katerinovka (Ekaterinivka) and Antonovka, from Vodyanoye and the mines to Bogoyavlenka, and the zone of control at Zolotaya Niva is expanding. ▪️ An unpleasant moment was the -beautiful reports- from the Seversky direction, which led to the impossibility of hitting the occupied areas with fire weapons and aviation, since they were subordinate to the senior command, which was informed of -full control- of areas of the area. After a series of publications uv.tov. Rybara, the situation has not changed, they write to us from the field: - They unsubscribed, they got rid of fake videos. Reports on science fiction continued.▪️ In addition, the judgment of the head of the State Duma Defense Committee Andrei Kartapolov that -blocking the Discord messenger will not affect the organization of communications between the military- became strange. He said that -For the most part, fighters use ordinary push-button phones for communication and radio stations. And you can’t fit Discord anywhere. The judgment is extremely strange, since there are a lot of photographs on the Internet using Discord at the front. By the way, there are alternatives to it, but the blocking of the software used (until the implementation of a new one) indicated some inconsistency in the actions of federal executive authorities.▪️ On the foreign policy circuit, joint statements by the military leadership of Poland and Lithuania about the need to prepare for war with Russia and the determination to strike at St. Petersburg, including, without waiting for permission from NATO. Thus, the West is preparing new countries to conduct military operations against our country, without applying Article 5 of the NATO Charter on collective defense.

At the same time, active work continues to destroy enemy industrial facilities in the rear. 🔻In the Glushkovsky district, the Russian Armed Forces are fighting on the northern outskirts of the New Way. Ukrainian formations are holding positions south of the railway track and are accumulating forces to carry out a counterattack in the area. The artillery and aviation of the Russian Armed Forces regularly strike the rear communications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, reducing their combat potential and complicating the supply of forward units. Thus, over the past 24 hours, the positions of Ukrainian formations in Pavlovka, Katerynivka and Iskriskivshchyna were hit. 🔻The battle for Lyubimovka continues in the Korenevsky district, where enemy units are semi-encircled. It is likely that in the near future the Ukrainian formations will be forced to either leave the village or carry out counterattacks in order to improve their position. ❗️Earlier, information appeared about the advance of Russian troops towards Sverdlikovo. To date, this has not been confirmed either by objective monitoring personnel or by data from our sources on the ground. It is difficult to determine the current configuration of the front in this sector due to the high rate of change in the combat situation. 🔻In the north of the Sudzhansky district, the Russian Armed Forces launched a series of artillery strikes on enemy positions in Russian Porechny. To the south, assault groups of Russian troops advance along the railway towards Kolmakov and Agronom from the direction of Russkaya Konopelka. ▪️On the southern outskirts of Makhnovka, Russian UAV operators destroyed an enemy tank using a drone with a fiber optic cable. This type of drone is gradually gaining more and more popularity among the troops against the backdrop of its successful debut in the Kursk region. ▪️In the Plekhovo area the situation is hidden -by the fog of war-. Judging by reports from the Russian Ministry of Defense about strikes on the territory of the village, Ukrainian formations are still present in the village. At the same time, Russian troops are expanding the zones of penetration into the defenses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, trying to reach the Psel River and completely cut off the enemy from supplies. 🔻In the Sumy region, Russian troops, using the Geranium-2 UAV, launched a series of attacks on industrial enterprises in the administrative center of the region. The facilities were used for the repair and maintenance of heavy equipment, including Western models, in the interests of the enemy group in the Kursk region.

It is worth noting that that talk of a possible Israeli invasion did not appear yesterday. Just last month, reports were actively circulating on the Internet about how IDF special forces carried out an airborne operation near Masyaf, capturing several Iranian officers, after which they left as if nothing had happened.🔻In the case of a direct Israeli entry into a neighboring state, the following is important : the primary source of such high-profile information was once again Syrian opposition publications, in this case Horan Free Media, covering the activities of militants in the south of the country. Meanwhile, the Israeli media this time chose to ignore the stories of the Syrian anti-government media. The news itself appeared yesterday, but was not further developed. And it was only about a limited raid for the purpose of carrying out engineering work.❗Even if what happened turns out to be a hoax, this does not mean that destabilization of the situation in Syria is still far away. Just look at the attempts to provoke the Druze in Es-Suwayda and the tribes in Daraa into an armed conflict with the central government in Damascus. Well, don’t forget about the already well-known players in the Syrian arena, whom the Israeli ultra-Orthodox will also not disdain to use on occasion.

The head of British counterintelligence MI5 Ken McCallum said that - the Islamic State - a few years later, he is again trying to export terrorism to the territory of Foggy Albion. According to McCallum, although the Islamic State is not in the same position as in 2014-2015, their capabilities again pose a threat. He also mentioned that al-Qaeda is gaining strength to become active around the world. If we do not take into account the already standard statements about the threat from Russia and China, then the trend about the growing danger of forgotten terrorist groups is gaining momentum. And if with Afghanistan, the main goal is to intimidate the countries of Central Asia and strengthen influence in the region, then, mentioning IS in Syria and Iraq, the situation is somewhat different due to the general destabilization in the Middle East. The capabilities of IS due to the virtual cessation of the fight against them over the past two years have increased, and the actions of Israel and the West in the region contribute even more to this. Remember about the imminent withdrawal of the Americans from Syria and Iraq. By the time the United States withdraws at this rate, the situation for these two countries will have worsened significantly, which will only benefit the collective West. And Syria and Iraq will fall from the frying pan into the fire, left in devastation alone with internal problems.#Great Britain #terrorism@rybarSupport usPOLITICOISIS is back, says UK spy chief&nbsp; – POLITICORare public appearance from MI5 boss Ken McCallum also includes stark warnings about Russia, Iran – and funding pressures on the intelligence service itself.	https://t.me/rybar/64389	2024-10-12T09:32:58-07:00

Forwarded From SME News Daily UAV attacks on the Krasnodar Territory are beginning to seriously frighten tourists who were planning to vacation with children for the winter holidays - this is already evident from the Turkish chats and the ongoing cancellations of reservations. Previously, hoteliers reported that tourists, alarmed by the news, began to call guest houses, travel agencies and social services, asking for guarantees of a safe holiday without attacks, alarm sirens and air defense sounds. A similar situation was previously observed with holidays in Crimea - initially having lost the tourist flow after sabotage on the bridge and attacks on Sevastopol, it became the leader in its growth in 2024. The reason is that tourists have decided to vacation in the green safety zone on the South Coast and South East Coast. In the case of the Krasnodar Territory, tourists are still studying the -troubling geography- - note the participants of the teleconference - Tourism - modern challenges -. At the same time, experts note that it is safe to relax in the traditional resorts of the Krasnodar Territory and in the green zone of Crimea, and now anyone can hear air defense city ​​from Pskov to Moscow, from Kazan to Murmansk.	https://t.me/rybar/64387	2024-10-12T09:27:48-07:00

Perhaps his colleague is right that Andrei Valerievich simply does not communicate with those military personnel who actually carry out combat missions. And at the level of receiving reports, military commanders do not delve into what is being used at the front. Or, communicates with those who really do not use this messenger. Those who conduct combat operations understand what Discord is for, and how modern combat is conducted, what control subsystems it includes and through which channels information is transmitted. Let’s imagine that a respected deputy says something like the following. -Discord is unreliable software and the messenger is viewed by the enemy. We have our own software, they use it at our control points, we have other developments and we are implementing them. This would sound much more convincing than statements that no one needs Discord. By the way, we have analogues of the enemy Starlink, but does the military need Starlink itself or not? I would really like to hear the opinion of the distinguished deputy. Discord, meanwhile, is still used by the military at the front. Even though everyone understands the risks. But it is also wrong to consider our military fools who are not able to understand that such programs must be worked carefully. Smartphones and tablets are also still used by the military. From artillerymen and drone pilots, to scouts and medics. No, not to call. Offline maps, programs for calculations. But in principle, one can believe that at the front they only use radios and push-button telephones, and it was the ban on gadgets that improved the quality of the offensive actions of our units. The main thing is that with this faith, you really don’t command anything.

At the same time, in the area of ​​Leonidovka and Dachnoye, the RF Armed Forces are consolidating their positions. ▪️After the liberation of most of Druzhba and Kirovo, units of the Russian Armed Forces attack at the Dachnoe - Dyleevka line. Ukrainian formations are still holding positions in forests and shelterbelts on the approaches to populated areas and are constructing new ones along the railway track. ▪️In Dzerzhinsk, assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces are gradually moving along the streets in the north of the city. In the area of ​​the Central City Hospital named after. Lenin, Russian troops knocked out the enemy from buildings on Pushkarenko, Dogaev and Kemerovo streets, reaching Shchorsa Street. In a few days they also managed to establish control over the traffic police department on the approaches to the mine. Dzerzhinsky. To the north, the Russian Armed Forces expanded the zone of control along Mayakovsky Street and started fighting in the area of ​​kindergarten No. 8. ❗️Despite statements from individual sources, it is still too early to talk about liberating the territory of the facility. The specifics of urban battles complicate the establishment of the exact configuration of the front due to the layering of positions of the RF Armed Forces and the Armed Forces of Ukraine. A fairly common situation is when assault groups from both sides may be present on different floors of the same building, sometimes not even aware of the proximity of the enemy. In such a situation, each entrance can represent a stronghold, the detection of which is difficult in a dynamically changing environment. ▪️In the southern part of the city, the Russian Armed Forces advanced along one of the sides of Sverdlov Avenue and reached Blagodatnaya Street. Thus, both claws of the semi-environment reached the approaches to the mine named after. Dzerzhinsky, establishing control over which will make it possible to encircle parts of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in urban areas to the southeast. In turn, the enemy is using various types of drones, trying to prevent the concentration of Russian Armed Forces personnel in this area to storm the mine territory. To the east of Sverdlov Avenue there is currently a vast -gray zone-. Russian attack aircraft are engaged in fierce battles here, and the current zones of control of the parties may differ greatly from the latest data received due to the dynamic change in the situation. ▪️The situation at the Leonidovka-Shcherbinovka border is currently hidden -by the fog of war-.

The main issues concerned military interaction between the countries within the framework of the new French approach to Africa.▪️The key point of the meeting was the discussion of the future fate of the base in Port Bouet and the 43rd Marine Battalion of the French Army, which is located there. According to preliminary agreements, along with the transfer of military facility under the sovereignty (although it is assumed that access will be shared) of Côte d'Ivoire, the French will build training and communications centers on it, leaving their presence solely as instructors. A month ago, in a similar way, French military personnel left the base in Lomo Nord.▪️In addition to this , the question was raised about further interaction between the military structures of the two countries. In particular, it is proposed to increase the joint military exercises that already took place in early September of this year. Taking into account the fact that the Americans have already agreed with the Ivorian authorities to build their own base for the redeployment of their military personnel from Niger, the reduction in the French contingent should not be surprising.

It is significant that the AN/MPQ-64 F1 Sentinel was designed for use as part of the NASAMS 2 air defense system, which is not in service with the Romanian Armed Forces, which may indicate the prospect of the appearance of such air defense systems in the Romanian direction (possibly on a temporary basis, transfer from the United States).🇧 🇬Bulgaria will become the owner of a NATO air defense system for the first time.

The second Indus Shield exercise started in Pakistan the day before yesterday. This event was first heard of last year, when 14 countries participated in it, and the main goal was the exchange of experience between pilots from different countries using different aircraft. This year there are only four participants - in addition to Pakistan and their F-16, JF-17 and J-10C, Saudi Tornado, Egyptian and Turkish F-16C/D fighters arrived in the Punjab province. In total - about 20 units.🔻Like last year, the main objective of the exercise is to assess the technologies and tactics of the participating countries using existing aircraft. Therefore, different types of fighters are involved in it. Moreover, one of the main aspects is to practice the joint use of aviation not only to carry out strikes, but also to repel an air attack. Taking into account the proximity of India, it is clear who acted as a conditional enemy. Against the backdrop of India’s increasingly intense involvement in military-political processes in the Asia-Pacific region, including as part of the anti-Chinese QUAD bloc, Pakistan also became more active and attracted its long-time partners.

Observers in the Middle East report that the Turks allowed the founder of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, Abdullah Ocalan, to contact the PKK and call on the organization's militants to lay down their arms. This happened in the wake of rumors that , that the Iranian leadership, due to the weakening of the axis of resistance, in particular Hezbollah, may conclude some kind of truce agreement with the PKK against the backdrop of a possible Israeli attack. I won’t talk about the reliability of this information, but the fact is that the Turks are seriously stuck in the quagmire called -Kurds- - this is a bold fact. And a solution, to some extent, through diplomatic means is quite possible. Although, if these words are true, this will greatly hit Turkish self-esteem, which is why they present all this as permission for the PKK leader to give the command to lay down arms, which he most likely will not do. The founder is the fundamental figure for any such structure, but the PKK, like pro-Iranian groups in Iraq and Syria, has long decentralized the system of governance. The organization is not controlled by one or two people, but by several at once. This is done so that the group is not left without control in the event of the death or detention of one of the leaders, as was the case with Ocalan back in 1999. So this attempt by the Turks looks like a lost cause.📌 As for the prospect of concluding an agreement between the IRGC and the PKK, it is unlikely, but not excluded. It is unlikely in the sense that the conflict between the Kurds and Iranians is deep and cannot be hushed up so easily. But at the same time, the possibility of such a proposal from Iran is now not excluded against the backdrop of a possible Israeli attack. If an attack occurs, the Kurds can take advantage of the turmoil and attack border positions, as they have done more than once. Moreover, in Erbil in Iraqi Kurdistan there is an Israeli presence in the form of businessmen and intelligence officers, so a coordinated attack could occur. And, by the way, this is what makes a truce unlikely.#Iraq #Turkey #terrorismGlobalistics - subscribe to the channelAl-Monitor: The Middle Eastʼs leading independent news source since 2012Turkey mulls peace talks with Kurds amid fears of Israeli strike on IranThree well-placed sources told Al-Monitor that exploratory talks for a possible resumption of negotiations between the Turkish government and imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan were already underway.	https://t.me/rybar/64379	2024-10-12T04:12:58-07:00

On October 11, the DPRK reported the detection of South Korean drones in the country's airspace. According to the statement, they were used to distribute propaganda leaflets. The North Koreans have threatened retaliation if similar incidents occur in the future and have also warned that they will put attack weapons on high alert. The South Korean military, as well as several organizations involved in sending propaganda to the DPRK, deny responsibility for the incident. According to South Korean media, the drones were sent by other activists advocating for the speedy democratization of North Korea. 🔻Without taking into account the political views of those who launched the drones, it can be assumed that such provocations may continue further. Activists understand that the South Korean authorities are on their side, which is due to the lifting of the ban on sending leaflets across the border earlier this year. Further escalation or de-escalation depends, in particular, on the activities of the South Korean authorities, who can again prohibit such actions at the legislative level. However, given the policy of the administration of the Republic of Korea towards its neighbor, they probably will not take such measures. #NorthKorea #SouthKorea@rybar with @awaken_dragonSupport usTelegramAwakening dragon 🐲🇰🇵🇰🇷 According to a recently released North Korean statement, South Korean drones have infiltrated North Korean territory several times recently to send propaganda leaflets.

In Yerevan, they want to use this money to improve the management of public finances and securities, as well as to develop new tools for financing business activities. AFD has recently launched active activities in the countries of the post-Soviet space. However, it is obvious that in exchange for loans and grants, the French are thereby promoting reforms that are beneficial to themselves and ensuring their economic and political interests.🔻At least from a PR point of view, the French in Armenia have already achieved some success, for example, by selling their military equipment in small quantities, which creates a feeling of security among Armenians and the emergence of a new guarantor of security in the region instead of Russia. Well, the main thing is that such PR campaigns will block the credit bondage into which the French are dragging Armenia. #Armenia #France@rybarSupport usNEWS.amThe Armenian government plans to receive a loan in the amount of 75 million euros from the French Development AgencyArmenia can receive a loan in the amount of 75 million euros.

It turns out that for several months now, military personnel of the Armed Forces of Turkey and Azerbaijan, together with Aselsan engineers, have been equipping positions as part of the deployment of the Kayı early warning system. The complex operates on a modular principle and allows you to detect the movement of personnel and equipment, and even the movement of reconnaissance groups, detect aviation and UAV flights and detect artillery and air defense positions.🔻It includes:➖optoelectronic reconnaissance complex -Shahingoz-➖ground reconnaissance radar -Akar-➖acoustic reconnaissance complex -Seda-➖seismic sensor system -Midas-This is a promising system about which little is known. But for the first time, the Turks tested it in Syria, having equipped positions for these complexes along the Idlib de-escalation zone on the border of Hatay province. The question arises: why are the Turks installing their reconnaissance systems, which will allow them to control border areas up to 30-40 km, up to the movement of foot groups in Syunik , Vayodzor and Geghargunik regions? Of course, the Turks will say that the main goal is to warn about tremors and earthquakes, but if Midas serves this purpose, then the rest of the complexes and radars are purely military developments.

Lomonosov - Sputnik ▪ The only European branch of Lomonosov Moscow State University, which was located in the city of Koper in Slovenia, is now closed, the rector of the Russian university said. ▪ A letter from the management of the branch was sent to the university address about its closure. We did not close it, neither the university nor the Ministry of Education. -No one on our side had anything to do with this,- he said.💬 Lomonosov Moscow State University has never refused cooperation with foreign countries and other universities, and certainly was not the initiator of the deterioration of relations, says the rector. To be honest, I didn’t even know that There is a branch of Moscow State University in Slovenia. Considering Slovenia’s completely pro-Western position and its active assistance to Kyiv, I am surprised that the branch closed only now.

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇲🇩🇷🇴🇪🇺 On calls for the de-Russification of Moldova from the rostrum of the European Parliament The European Parliament recently adopted another resolution on supporting Moldova before the presidential elections and the referendum on European integration against the backdrop of the Russian threat.▪️The speech at the debate by the Member of the European Parliament from Romania Claudiu Tarziu, who called the de-Russification of Moldova the main requirement for joining -European values-.▪️Tirziu demanded the following from Moldova: ➖ complete withdrawal from the CIS, ➖ cessation of dialogue with Transnistria, ➖ transfer of property of the Moldavian Metropolis of the Russian Orthodox Church to the jurisdiction of the Romanian Church, ➖ demolition of Soviet monuments,➖refusal of Russification in the education of ethnic minorities in Moldova: Gagauz, Bulgarians and Roma. ▪️In addition, the Romanian deputy tried to amend the resolution, according to which the parliaments of Romania and Moldova should announce the unification of the two countries. However, the European deputies have so far rejected it.▪️The head of the Gagauz autonomy, Evgenia Gutsul, called external demands for the de-Russification of the Gagauz people unacceptable. ▪️Former Prime Minister of Moldova Vasily Tarlev pointed out that Tarziu actually voiced that part of the agreements about which President Maia Sandu and the government of her ruling party, PAS, are so bashfully silent. At the same time, the Central Election Commission of Moldova is already trying to remove Tarlev’s candidacy from the presidential elections , which will take place on October 20. 🔻Romanian politicians have long been voicing their plans to seize Moldova and completely Romanianize the local population. Bucharest also does not deny that the most effective way in this case is the European integration of Moldova. Obviously, this is one of the reasons why Sandu’s Romanian civil society office declares any criticism of the republic’s accession to the EU to be disinformation. At the same time, censorship is being imposed in Moldova and any Russian-language content that does not correspond to the policy of the authorities is blocked. After Sandu's re-election, de-Russification trends will clearly intensify.#Moldova #Romania #EU @pezdicide no chemistry - just factsEuropean ParliamentParliament condemns Russia's interference in Moldova&nbsp;On Wednesday, MEPs adopted a resolution issuing a strong warning against continued Russian attempts to derail Moldova's pro-European trajectory.	https://t.me/rybar/64374	2024-10-12T00:21:28-07:00

Forwarded From SPECIAL FORCES ARCHANGEL Z🇷🇺🪖 Next week in NATO, the Steadfast Noon exercise of the Alliance's nuclear forces begins.&nbsp;From October 14, an important combat training event will start in Western Europe to practice the use of the aviation component of NATO's strategic nuclear forces, which involves more than 60 units aviation.&nbsp;The exercise will last two whole weeks, during which the enemy will work out a scenario for the use of nuclear weapons, however, the aircraft participating in Steadfast Noon will not be equipped with nuclear warheads. &nbsp;This training takes place annually, and the main purpose is to test the combat readiness of aviation, which carries nuclear weapons. This list of tasks also includes testing routes for using aviation.&nbsp;Last year, the exercise took place in Italy, Croatia and in the Mediterranean Sea. The bulk of the exercise took place at least 1,000 km from the borders of Russia. This year, Steadfast Noon is planned over the UK, the Netherlands and Belgium, and is expected to involve American B-52N strategic bomber aircraft. A pair of bombers on October 8 made a flight from the United States, circumnavigating the UK and reaching the coasts of the Netherlands and Belgium, which could be a test version of the use of the B-52N before an important exercise. The purpose of these exercises is as follows: to practice the withdrawal of historically nuclear forces of air-based nuclear warheads for transfer to the European theater of war actions. So to speak, deploy your planes in Europe, and then hit Russia. &nbsp;Despite the fact that the declared areas are far from Russia, flights of American aircraft in the direction of the Russian Federation cannot be ruled out. This is an elementary transfer of forces, which is carried out to practice striking Russia. &nbsp;It is worth adding that they conduct such exercises regularly, but the scale is not so large.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our soldiers are fully prepared. There is a developed counteraction toolkit, which involves not only the Aerospace Forces, but also other components of the army. Political pressure works primarily on us. And then to the internal audience.&nbsp;On the aviation side, they check the coherence of the crews, as well as interactions with ground services and other branches of the military. &nbsp;Since, in addition to the flight personnel, that side is actively using the naval group, satellite group and ground forces in the European Union.

The last time this was observed was during the demarcation of borders in the area of ​​disputed enclaves, but this was due to control over this process. Now there are no visible reasons for enhanced reconnaissance - even statements about shelling along the border are extremely rare. And the fact that this happened immediately after Pashinyan’s visit to Moscow looks suspicious. Moreover, now the Armenian air defense system is practically defenseless, since Russian radar groups were withdrawn from their usual positions near Lake Sevan, so the activity of the Azerbaijani Armed Forces UAVs could become news for the Armenian Ministry of Defense High resolution mapEnglish version#Azerbaijan #Armenia@rybar Support us	https://t.me/rybar/64359	2024-10-11T10:58:11-07:00

What was mistakenly taken for an attack attracted the attention of Western media: along the route of the convoy, French media received satellite images to track its movement. ▪️In addition, the Tuaregs again mobilized their forces in order to follow on the heels of government troops and the forces of the Russian PMC. At this time, the Algerian authorities who patronized them, without waiting for the start of another crisis associated with migrants from Tin-Zautin, strengthened the border, marking it with ditches in the desert.▪️The fighters of the PMC - Wagner - definitely drew conclusions from the sad July experience. Thanks to the use of mock-up equipment and the involvement of local militias who knew the terrain, the column skillfully avoided ambushes. After arriving at the battlefield on July 27, the remains of the dead were collected, and the area was mined, including with decoys in the form of supposedly fallen UAVs -Cube.❗️ In fact, the enemy was convinced of their intentions to storm their last stronghold, while they were mistakenly amassing forces at the Algerian borders. At the same time, there is no talk of any ransom or goodwill gestures from the Tuaregs - the plan was accomplished as a result of planned actions on the ground. During the operation, difficulties arose only at the entrances to the city of Kidal, where the Islamists, having already figured out plan, attacked a government vehicle with an IED. But in general, the bodies of the fallen soldiers were able to be delivered to their destination, after which they will be sent to Russia. However, it is possible that this successful operation will be one of the last for the Wagner PMC in Mali as a separate structure. Now there is active talk about the deployment of the African Corps in the country, which by the end of the year could replace the Wagnerites - this has already happened in Libya.

This will be dealt with by a recruiting center, the creation of which was announced in Kyiv back in September. The appearance of such an order is expected against the backdrop of problems in Ukrainian formations with a shortage of command staff. Over almost three years of hostilities, the enemy suffered serious losses in junior and senior officers, and military universities cannot produce them in the required quantities, especially against the backdrop of the deployment of new formations. However, it is very doubtful that in the same NATO countries there will be so many people willing to go in the Armed Forces of Ukraine as commanders of companies, battalions or specialist officer positions. Moreover, the peak of recruitment of mercenaries is already in the distant past, and the same Western military advisers or instructors are unlikely to want to change their -military registration-.📌 However, there is another side: such a legislative measure eliminates bureaucratic obstacles to the appointment of foreigners and general positions. Therefore, if (or when) Western sponsors of the so-called. If Ukraine wants to transfer the Armed Forces of Ukraine to a regime of full direct control, they will be able to do this quite officially. And the likelihood of such a scenario, given the events taking place in the last six months, does not seem so negligible in the foreseeable future. #NATO #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTACCRada allowed foreigners to become officers of the VSUZ, Deputy Head of the Parliamentary Committee on National Security, Defense and Intelligence Egor Chernev previously admitted that there is a shortage of officers in the troops	https://t.me/rybar/64356	2024-10-11T08:25:19-07:00

Ukraine for the training of Ukrainian Armed Forces recruits. The initiative will supposedly solve logistical problems and send a powerful military and political signal. We are talking about introducing changes to the order of former Prime Minister Boris Johnson in June 2022, when it was decided to train Ukrainian personnel in the UK. Since then, more than 45 thousand members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces have passed through training grounds in Foggy Albion. This proposal is reminiscent of recent conversations about the need to send coalition forces to the territory of the so-called. Ukraine. By the way, then ex-Minister of Foreign Affairs David Cameron did not support a similar idea with the mass dispatch of British instructors.📌 So what has changed since then? Apparently, in London they continue to prepare public opinion for the next round of escalation, Moreover, everything may not be limited to the training of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Ukrainian territory by the British Army. After all, some time after this, Great Britain, together with other countries, may send a limited contingent to the western regions of the so-called. Ukraine in order to free up, albeit not the most numerous, units located on the border with Belarus in order to send them to the front line.🔻The initiative itself pursues several goals. On the one hand, theoretically this can reduce the economic costs of the preparation process and speed it up. At the same time, it is becoming more difficult for the British to disguise their presence against the backdrop of the scale of involvement in the conflict, so the official deployment of trainers will make this task easier. Well, the political signal the UK traditionally sends is quite clear: London is ready to fight to the last Ukrainian.#Great Britain&nbsp;#Russia #Ukraine@rybar together with @oldGBRSupport usThetimesUK could send troops to Ukraine on training missionGenerals consider money-saving deployment as Starmer hosts Zelensky at No. 10	https://t.me/rybar/64355	2024-10-11T07:12:06-07:00
🇰🇵🇰🇷 On South Korea's possible military response to garbage b...	🇰🇵🇰🇷 About South Korea's possible military response to garbage balloons North Koreans continue to send garbage balloons to the territory of their southern neighbor. This week, two launches have already been recorded, during which a total of about 220 balloons crossed the border between the countries. ▪️In response to this, the recently appointed South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun said that the military leadership knows the exact launch sites. This, in his opinion, makes it possible for the South Korean military to strike both them and the command and support structures involved in sending the balloons. ▪️According to the politician’s statements, the leadership will resort to such a response if the North Koreans -cross the line-. It was previously reported that the condition for a military reaction is a threat to the safety of South Korean citizens. ▪️For now, a military response seems unlikely. The main reason is the disproportion between the hypothetical strike on North Korean territory and the launch of the balloons itself. Yes, they do cause material damage, but they cannot definitely be called an act of military aggression on the part of the DPRK. 🔻In addition, the statements of the Minister of Defense diverge from the previously expressed point of view that the North Koreans are just waiting for a sharp response from South Korea to justify further actions, for example, shelling the islands in the Yellow Sea. And, most likely, Seoul understands that a potential military response could lead to an unnecessary escalation of the conflict. Maybe this is why the conditions for striking the territory of the DPRK are hidden under such vague formulations about lines that cannot be crossed. It can be assumed that the statements are more aimed at the domestic audience, which, according to the same minister, is worried about the launching of garbage balloons. Threats against North Korea are a way to show that the situation is not out of control, and the arsenal of measures against further launches has not yet been exhausted. with garbage This will happen if Pyongyang -crosses the line-, said the Minister of Defense of the Republic of Korea Kim Yong-hyun	https://t.me/rybar/64354	2024-10-11T06:03:03-07:00
🇷🇺🇺🇦 Effective strikes by the Russian Armed Forces in recent ...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 The effective strikes of the Russian Armed Forces in recent days on ships with ammunition in the ports of the Odessa region, accompanied by large detonations and flooding of dry cargo ships, led to a natural effect - an increase in the cost of insurance for ships heading to the so-called. Ukraine. Bloomberg, citing its sources, claims that after the Russian attacks, this figure increased from 0.75 to 1% of the ship’s price. And shipowners, in these conditions, insure against war risks of cargo separately from the ships themselves, which they were not previously interested in. It has long been no secret that the ports of Odessa have been operating at their previous capacity for a year and a half. This is caused by both the losses of the Black Sea Fleet, which, due to the threat of BACs and missile strikes, is actually locked in bases, as well as the difficulty of disabling the naval infrastructure - sea harbors cannot be destroyed by Geraniums or X-101. But the defeat of the ships themselves that go there is really capable influence Ukrainian maritime traffic, solving the problem of the impossibility (in current realities) of a blockade of the coast and the destruction of Odessa ports. At a minimum, making it more costly due to military risks. Yes, it all comes down to target designation - effective strikes on dry cargo ships in previous days were carried out thanks to Russian UAVs that successfully flew into enemy rear areas. But since such an opportunity still exists, it is quite possible to make the most of it.#Odessa #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usBloomberg.comRussian Attacks Spark Surge in War Insurance for Ukraine GrainsThe cost of insuring vessels that transit Ukraine's shipping corridor in the Black Sea jumped this week after Russia ramped up attacks on key ports.	https://t.me/rybar/64353	2024-10-11T05:04:06-07:00

In addition, it was possible to clarify the situation in Medvezhye: Russian troops not only liberated the village, but also drove the enemy out of the adjacent forest belts. Thus, units of the 137th infantry regiment, 56th airborne infantry regiment, 51st infantry regiment, 155th infantry infantry regiment, 83rd airborne infantry brigade and 1434th regiment -Akhmat-Chechnya- almost completely knocked out the Ukrainian formations from the Glushkovsky district. The presence of the Ukrainian Armed Forces remains only in the gully south of Krasnooktyabrsky and in the New Way, as well as a small triangle with forest belts south of the railway. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, the Russian Armed Forces were also able to make significant progress in the vicinity of Lyubimovka - Zeleny Shlyakh, the villages of Pokrovsky and Nizhny Klin came under control. At the same time, in Lyubimovka there are still oncoming battles, the enemy is clinging to the settlement, finding himself semi-encircled on the outskirts and in the village of Tolstoy Lug.▪️At the same time, it is curious that in the fields south of Olgovka and west of Kremyanoy, according to some sources, there are still Scattered enemy groups remain, cut off from the rest of the forces. Apparently, it will be possible to find out about their future fate soon.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, fighting also continues and the Russian Armed Forces are advancing. According to our information, the village of Fanaseevka, contrary to recent rumors, remains under the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, but in the Plekhovo region the Russian Armed Forces have made significant progress. Thus, Russian troops are advancing from the direction of Ulanka through swampy forests near the Psel River and have now half-covered Plekhovo, disrupting the enemy’s supply, bypassing him from the south and north. ▪️In the north, a large forest has come under the control of the Russian Armed Forces; according to preliminary information, highway 38N-515 in the Plekhovo-Makhnovka section has already been cut. To the south, Russian troops took several strong points, including those created by the enemy from scratch. ▪️Even further north - in the area of ​​​​Russkaya Konopelka - fighting continues: neither side has complete control over the settlement, but the Russian paratroopers have the initiative here. To the south, the Russian Armed Forces are moving along the railway towards Kolmakov and Agronom, taking control of stop point 66 kilometer. If the rate of advance is maintained, the enemy will either be forced to withdraw from Russkaya Konopelka, or will simply end there. To the southwest of the railway there is also an advance of the Russian Armed Forces. The enemy has been knocked out of several forest belts east of the gas station, for which battles are taking place, and after some time it is very likely that there will be reports of battles already for Cherkasy Konopelka. ▪️Thus, units 810 OGVBRMP, 40 OGVBRMP, 11 Guards Oshbr, 1220 MSP and -Akhmat-, having gone on the offensive some time ago, were able to make significant progress, pushing towards Sudzha and the suburbs from the south. ❗️At the same time, yesterday, extremely contradictory information appeared about the breakthrough of Russian troops already to the outskirts of Sudzha. However, for now this looks doubtful, although a certain probability of such a scenario exists.

Last week, a list of members of the cabinet of the new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba was published, which did not include the position of curator of economic relations with the Russian Federation. According to authorities, the Japanese leader personally decided to eliminate it. This post was created back in 2016 by former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Then the authorities considered it as the main instrument for the development of bilateral economic relations necessary to achieve progress in resolving the issue of the Kuril Islands. Work on this channel was suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic. After its completion, it was needed for the exit of local companies from the Russian market, forced to leave it due to Tokyo sanctions. 🔻Given that the position of curator of economic relations has recently looked more and more like a rudiment, there have been no large-scale changes in Japanese policy. However, in fact, Ishiba is thus abandoning the legacy of Abe, who did a lot to develop relations with Moscow. This decision can be interpreted as a sign that under the new prime minister, relations between Russia and Japan will remain at the same, almost zero level, or will become even worse. #Russia #Japan@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usSouth China Morning PostJapan axes Russia cooperation post in sign of tougher Moscow stanceThe move reflects Tokyo’s growing frustration at stalled negotiations over disputed islands and marks a departure from Shinzo Abe’s policies.	https://t.me/rybar/64349	2024-10-11T03:07:58-07:00

We can recall the FPV drones - Ghoul - which have come a long way from the assembly of small batches in the basement of a former printing house to actually full-fledged industrial production and development of technologies -machine vision-. The same can be said about the unmanned boats -Murena-: after months of struggle in the offices and justification of the need to promote this project, the resolution to provide support to Russian BECs was received.🔻And yesterday, colleagues Two Majors presented a development that was financed by public donations, and it is already in full use by our troops on the line of combat contact. Judging by the footage shown, it was quite successful. Using a hoverboard as a kamikaze drone looks like a non-trivial solution. Their maneuverability and small dimensions, coupled with a relatively large warhead and the ability to be used within a radius of 5 km, can be of great help in storming strongholds. When used in combination with other reconnaissance and fire weapons, such vehicles act as a very formidable weapon in conditions of trench warfare. Let's hope that their use by Russian troops in the offensive against fortified areas will soon become widespread. #industry #Russia@rybar Support usTelegramTwo Majors✨Combat work of kamikaze vehicles -Two Majors-✨Self-propelled vehicles, designed on the basis of popular hoverboards, are already widely used at the Front.

Exercise Sama Sama 2024 began recently in Philippine waters, with military personnel from the Philippines, the United States, Australia, Japan, Canada and France participating. The main goals of such exercises are always similar - increasing interoperability and strengthening security ties between regional partners. The military personnel will practice anti-submarine and anti-ship operations, as well as measures aimed at combating air targets. 📌It is important to note that Sama Sama 2024 is an annual exercise that initially only involved Filipino and American military personnel. However, in the last few years, training has been conducted in a multilateral format, which once again provides an opportunity for military personnel from non-regional countries to deploy equipment in Southeast Asia. As stated, training locations are limited to the territorial waters of the Philippines. In addition, the exercises will not be held near the disputed Scarborough Reef, the site of frequent skirmishes between the Philippines and the Chinese in the South China Sea. But even despite the statements, it is worth understanding that it will not be difficult for the parties to go beyond the territorial waters into the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines. And since the PRC considers this part of the waters to be theirs, the Chinese military will once again be able to send ships to monitor military activity unfolding in the disputed part of the region.

The advanced groups of Russian troops reached the Green Way by the end of the day, which allows us to assert that there was at least a partial breakthrough of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ defense. 🔻In the Glushkovsky district, Russian troops are repelling enemy attacks south of Vesely, trying to prevent the advance of Ukrainian formations to highway 38N-052, leading to the administrative center of the district. Despite the problems in other areas, the enemy continues to attack here.🔻In the Korenevsky district, the Russian Armed Forces launched a series of attacks on the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. An advanced armored group of Russian troops was spotted chasing an enemy tank northwest of Zeleny Shlyakh. The settlement is located a little less than five kilometers from the previously noted front line in the Lyubimovka area, while the armored group of the Russian Armed Forces itself was moving from the north. Russian troops broke through the defenses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces to the north in the Kremyanoy area and actually cut off the ledge at the front that abutted Korenevo and Olgovka. Control over the Green Way will allow Russian troops to block the enemy’s supply lines through the 38K-030 route, which plays an important role in the logistics of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Also, footage of the passage of Russian Armed Forces equipment on the Korenevo-Sudzha highway towards Zeleny Shlyakh appeared on the Internet, which also confirms the success of the attack near Olgovka. In the Sudzhansky district, Russian troops also went on the offensive in several sectors of the front and achieved tactical successes. So, according to some reports, they liberated the settlement of Novaya Sorochina and are now moving towards Malaya Lokna. There is also information about a deep breakthrough of Russian troops into the defense line of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in one of the sectors, but it is still impossible to assess the scale of the advance, and rumors about reaching the northern outskirts of Sudzha look overly optimistic. At the same time, to the west of the city, another use of the UAV -Inokhodets- was recorded, which may indicate preparations for the assault. There is information from the ground that Russian troops have also made significant progress in the Plekhovo area from Ulanka and Borok, but there are no more detailed details of the attack yet.❗️The success of the double strike of Russian troops in the Korenevsky district may lead to the encirclement of significant forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, but before that At the moment, there are still several settlements to go through, which have been occupied and fortified by the enemy for quite some time.

We have already written more than once about a series of scandals involving expelled British Embassy employees who were in contact with Russian oppositionists, supported the work of anti-government media and were directly coordinating protests, and also tried to influence migration politics in the Russian Federation. Some of them did this by directly supervising fairly well-known journalists and NGO leaders, but the activities of some not so public persons turned out to be no less interesting and potentially much more dangerous in view of the current crime and migration situation.📌According to the FSB, one of those who lost accreditation of diplomats - Blake Patel - specialized in working with Russian Muslims. According to official data, this gentleman was in contact with representatives of the Spiritual Administration of Muslims of the Russian Federation, namely, the head of the science department of the Department of Science and Education, Ilyas Sadulin, who, according to some sources, participates in international visits as an assistant to the Russian mufti. Some characterize these contacts as consultations with subject matter experts, in which there may be nothing reprehensible, however, if we take into account the peculiarities of the activities of one of the structures of British intelligence - the Directorate of Eastern Europe and Central Asia - everything may not be so simple. 🔻Read more in our new article #Great Britain #article #Russia @rybar Support us	https://t.me/rybar/64323	2024-10-10T11:01:50-07:00

Forwarded From DTM🇷🇺🇰🇬🇺🇿🇹🇯🇰🇿🇹🇲 On the security of the migration field of Russia and the countries of Central Asia▪️After the expulsion of British diplomats from Russia for espionage, general attention was attracted by the fact that employees of the English embassy, ​​among other things, coordinated projects on foreign interference in the migration policy of the Russian Federation.▪️In particular, diplomat Jessica Davenport supervised foreign agent Svetlana Gannushkina, whose public activities were closely related to the liberalization of migration legislation, the importation of foreigners into the country and their illegal settlement in Russia. The British financed Svetlana Gannushkina’s projects.▪️A little later, an investigation appeared about how international structures, for example, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), working under the UN, were doing approximately the same thing.▪️In coordination with diasporas and an extensive network of pro-Western NGOs, IOM has been implemented for years in the processes of -improving- Russian migration legislation, created a favorable environment for the consolidation of visitors to the Russian Federation and their penetration into all sectors of the Russian economy.▪️ Among the sponsors of IOM projects are such well-known donors of color revolutions as the World Bank and the UK Department for International Cooperation and Development.C What is the reason for the obsessive desire of foreign benefactors to help a sovereign state in matters of migration? It's simple: control over the flow of visitors is a weapon that can be used in your own interests.▪️Accordingly, establishing order in the migration legislation of the Russian Federation is a security issue. Including for the migrants themselves, since Russia has seriously taken up the transfer of all foreign labor flows into a completely legal channel and invites its neighbors to join in this work.▪️Do the neighbors need this? If you think that migration is a weapon in the hands of the West, directed only against Russia, think again. The same IOM implements projects throughout Central Asia. For example, the organization’s partner is the Center for Employment of Citizens Abroad under the Ministry of Labor of Kyrgyzstan, which is also friends with USAID. Such are the things.▪️Numerous foundations, associations and other NGOs financed by foreign structures, under the guise of human rights and educational activities, have long been organizing the import of foreigners to republics friendly to Russia. Yes, not on the same scale as people from the region come to Russia, but citizens of Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt and other countries of the Global South also go there to work. At the same time, the number of visitors, as well as those who stayed as guests, is steadily growing through the efforts of networks of pro-Western NGOs.▪️Needless to say, in this way, immigrants from countries with a very unstable military-political situation and widespread radical religious teachings enter the territory of the republics. ▪️As for the export of citizens of the Central Asian republics abroad, after the start of the Northern Military District in Western Europe, interest in labor from this region suddenly increased. For example, for Kyrgyzstan, Great Britain increased the quota for seasonal workers to 8 thousand people in 2023. Germany is ready to accept 50 thousand people from Uzbekistan in 2024.▪️At the same time, in a number of cases, when a European country enters into contracts with visitors for a year, it no longer accepts these same migrants the next season. This is necessary for coverage, so that as many people from Central Asia as possible pass through Western migrant assistance centers, educational and labor programs. In the future, hard workers who returned to their homeland are the basis for realizing the conflict potential in the interests of foreign assistants in organizing migration processes. Conclusion. If Russia has undertaken to eradicate illegal migration, then this is not a reason to be offended, but an excellent reason for the main participants in intra-regional migration processes to restore order at home. To do this, you need to answer a simple question - in whose interests are those working who help organize the export, training and employment of compatriots, as well as the import and settlement of foreigners? @dntreadonmeTelegramDTM🇷🇺🇬🇧 There are losses in the enemy camp, entrenched right in Moscow.

Forwarded From Warsaw Mermaid🌎🏳️‍🌈🇵🇱 By the way, in connection with the news about the affairs of the Polish State Treasury with global corporations. One of the options for pressure from TNCs is to push certain ideas, theses and beliefs through manipulation of the stock market. The mechanics are very simple: companies that do not follow LGBT values ​​are simply not included in the investment portfolio. That is: an ultimatum and blackmail. This happened, for example, with the symbol of American conservatives - the Harley Davidson company, which was persuaded to promote the LGBT agenda. And Poland was also taken seriously in this regard: the other day a special US envoy for promoting human rights for LGBT people Jessica Stern. US Ambassador to Poland Mark Brzezinski, a regular participant in LGBT parades in the Polish capital along with its mayor, said that Stern held a meeting with representatives of LGBTQI+ civil society. They discussed the commitment to ensure equal respect and dignity for every person, as well as key issues for the LGBT community. Brzezinski stressed that the American government is obliged to protect and fight for the rights of gays, lesbians and transgender people. They say that human rights are indivisible and that’s all.📌I have to agree with MEP Grzegorz Braun in assessing this situation: there is no transatlanticism without transgenderism and there is no vassalization without sodomization.#Poland #LGBT #globalism@pl_syrenka - Poland is not a foreign countryTelegramRybar💰🌎🇵🇱 The Polish Treasury has entered into an agreement to sell government bonds worth $8 billion with a group of companies, including Citigroup, controlled by BlackRock, as well as J.P.

Rybar: 🇬🇪 Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said that if the ruling party wins the parliamentary elections, pragmatic policies and a peaceful resolution of the conflict with Russia will be an important priority for the country. He called a reset another task... 🇬🇪🇷🇺 Statements by the ruling Georgian authorities about their intention to peacefully resolve the conflict with Russia resonate in Moscow: today President Vladimir Putin signed a decree expanding the visa-free regime for Georgian citizens. The restrictions in force since 2000 have been lifted. last summer, however, there remained a clause on the need for visas for labor migrants planning to stay in Russia for more than three months. Now this provision has been canceled.📌 Although this decision can hardly be called revolutionary, it is still important in its own way. First of all, from the point of view of the sequence of actions, when in response to constructive statements from Tbilisi, Russia takes, albeit small, practical steps in response. And at the very least, this looks more advantageous against the backdrop of the policy of the collective West. Who now increasingly prefers to speak with the Georgian authorities in the language of threats and ultimatums with interference in the internal affairs of the country, such as demands to repeal the law banning LGBT propaganda. At the same time, it is unlikely that the expansion of a visa-free regime for Georgian citizens can be interpreted as a sign of restoration of relations between states. But some trends can be traced here. #Georgia #Russia@rybarSupport us TelegramBefore anyone else.

Morgan. The amount, although not huge, is significant: probably, the TNCs thus decided to stake out a clearing for themselves, and at the same time bind the local authorities more closely to themselves, in order to continue to determine the economy of Warsaw, and therefore its politics. It is no coincidence that the agreement also includes -assessment of Poland's resource potential - a kind of audit of future assets of corporations. After all, it is obvious that Poland, already experiencing significant economic problems and having no prospects, will not be able to give money to creditors. This will lead to the fact that all assets will end up in the hands of corporations, which will get them at a bargain price.📌 Thus, a fairly typical scenario for globalists is being implemented in Poland, the goal of which is usually to destroy or reformat the country. One of his points: to bring the country’s economy to bankruptcy in order to buy everything for next to nothing. This is usually done by cutting off supplies of cheap energy resources, inflating inflation and selling government bonds. They are being bought by Western investment funds - the already familiar BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street and others. And then they need to reduce the value of assets that serve as collateral for government bonds. This is possible through a local market collapse or military conflict. And for those who are already actively pushing the Poles into battle as cannon fodder, the choice of plot twist is obvious. #globalism #Poland @rybar together with @pl_syrenkaSupport usTelegramTomasz Szmydt - Fundacja -Polska Prawda- / Tomasz Schmidt - Foundation -Polish Pravda-Ostatnie resztki polskiej suwerenności zostały sprzedane amerykańskiemu -BlackRock-Dzień dobry.

Forwarded From Belarusian security officer 🇧🇾Yesterday, many swore at Rybar and his series of posts about Verkhnekamenka, as well as the situation in the Seversky direction in general. Like, why does Rybar help the enemy and refute the capture of some settlement. It’s not even about Rybar and not even specifically in this case. This is not the first year that the war has been going on and at the front - fighting on debt - this is often a habitual activity. If someone doesn’t know, then -to fight on duty- is when your commander has already marked on the map the settlement/support/landing that was behind the enemy as taken and reported this above. That is, you continue to fight further, trying to complete the assigned task, but now in debt. And well, if everything ended on maps and reports, there would be no collateral damage. When it is reported that some conditional settlement or square has been taken, then the corresponding adjustments are made in the General Staff, on their maps, and all this makes direct adjustments when planning further advancement.

The agreement will allow Qatar to use military training grounds on the territory of Kazakhstan. In addition, the ratified agreement covers cooperation in the fields of military education, medicine, military science, cultural events and consultations in peacekeeping operations.📌 Apparently, this is another echo of Tokayev’s visit to Qatar earlier this year, when several agreements were concluded between the countries. But the fact that one of them was interaction in the defense sector is extremely interesting. Therefore, an interesting combination comes to mind: Qatar is a British gas station, and on its territory there is also a large American military base called Ed-Dhafra. That is, the following picture emerges: the British signed a strategic partnership agreement with Kazakhstan in the spring, which affected everything possible except the military sphere. ❗️And now one of the main British partners in the Persian Gulf has gained access to military training grounds and other defense facilities of Kazakhstan, a member of the CSTO. It’s hard to call it a coincidence.🔻Well, it’s also worth noting that Kazakhstan is preparing for a serious fuel shortage due to a shutdown for repairs at the Atyrau Oil Refinery.

The Canadian Foreign Ministry warned back in 2021, that among the victims were members of the SS and Nazi collaborators. However, plans to open a memorial in the center of Ottawa in November 2023 were prevented only by a scandal with an ovation for Jaroslav Hunke, a member of the SS-Galicia division, in the Canadian Parliament. The completed memorial has remained closed to the public since then. Heritage Canada, which is responsible for the memorial, has been vague about ongoing reviews, and activists and organizations, including Jewish ones, have called for 330 names to be removed from the list of victims of communism. 📌This is not the first scandal with the memorial. When the project was approved in 2009, the memorial was planned to cost $1.1 million and be funded entirely by private donations from Tribute to Liberty, an organization founded by politicians and businessmen whose families fled communist countries. However, the project budget subsequently ballooned to $5.5 million, and the remaining amount was covered from the state budget.🔻 -The Memorial to the Victims of Communism is just another example of how the descendants of Ukrainian nationalists who fled to Canada after the Second World War are trying to rewrite history and pass off the crimes of their ancestors as -the fight against the Soviet regime-. And the diaspora will try with all its might to bring the project to completion, until the costs of scandals outweigh the political benefits of supporting the so-called Ukraine.#Canada #Ukraine@rybarSupport us ottawacitizenVictims of Communism memorial faces call to remove over 330 names linked to Nazis, fascistsA Canadian Heritage report obtained by the Ottawa Citizen recommends removing more than 330 names from the memorial.	https://t.me/rybar/64313	2024-10-10T05:06:01-07:00
