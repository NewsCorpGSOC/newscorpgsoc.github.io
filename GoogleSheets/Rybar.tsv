Forwarded From RTVI📺 Military observer and&nbsp;author of the telegram channel -Rybar- Mikhail Zvinchuk&nbsp;is a guest of the new episode of the program -What was that- on&nbsp;RTVI&nbsp;with Yuri Kukin. We collected the main thing: 💬 About the state of defensive positions in the Kursk region before the invasion of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: - The Kursk direction, as I believe, was simply abandoned. Let's call things by their proper names. And the checks that in January showed that everything was fine, everything was equipped, everything was being done, probably should have been carried out more often, and they should have been more objective -.💬 About the situation in the Kursk region: - At this stage, the Ukrainian formations are digging in on the -line Surovikina- &lt;…&gt; Attempts to bring in engineering equipment have been recorded, but there has been no large-scale digging in the occupied parts of the Kursk region. This means that while we still have time to eliminate pockets of resistance and not lead to, in fact, a phase of heavy positional battles with complete destruction of the terrain -.💬 About the situation in Sudja: - In Sudja everything is not so good, unfortunately , in&nbsp;Sudzha has to admit that there is an enemy who, yes, mostly focuses on the western part of the city. The eastern part is still disputed, but nevertheless, the enemy is present in the western part.💬 About the participation of conscripts in the defense of the Kursk region: - Conscripts are exactly the same military personnel who took the oath, just like contract military personnel . At the same time, since the first day of a special military operation, conscript units have been conducting artillery duels, reconnaissance, organizing communications, and logistics support for our troops in the border territories. This is a common function. And&nbsp;if we&nbsp;are talking about&nbsp;aggression on&nbsp;the territory of the Russian Federation, it doesn’t matter what units there are, these are military personnel-.💬 -Rybar- about&nbsp;the possibility of a new wave of mobilization in&nbsp;Russia: - I&nbsp;at&nbsp;at&nbsp;not&nbsp;at this stage&nbsp; I’m sure that they will actually go for it, because this is a very risky move for the authorities from a reputational point of view - ➡️ See the full episode at the link ⭕ Subscribe to RTVIYouTube - All-in - Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk region, participation of conscripts, negotiations or mobilization / Zvinchuk, -Rybar-The operation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk region has been going on for more than 10 days, and a CTO regime has been declared in three regions of Russia.

And there is no answer to the question. Simply because both the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the Western media know that Russia is not like that, Russian troops will not hit journalists, because this is wrong. The last foray of the Ukrainian media into Sudzha also followed the same scenario. While there are journalists in the area, the local military-political leadership is simply afraid of the geopolitical consequences. How can they accuse Russia of deliberately targeting the media? And not just Ukrainian, but Western? 📍This will be a scandal! We ourselves blame the Ukrainians for this, it’s impossible - these and other arguments can be heard on the sidelines.🔻And while there are debates on this topic in Russia, such journalists are, in fact, used as a human shield for the activities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And all this continues to cause reputational and political damage to the Russian side, and no one can make a strong-willed decision. The fact that we look at the opinion of the world community and how they will think about us can be seen in the entire nature of the conduct of hostilities. If it were otherwise, strikes would have been carried out long ago on transformers around nuclear power plants in so-called Ukraine in order to cut them off from the energy system. But we are afraid of incorrect interpretation and provocations. But while we are afraid, that side, apparently, has completely lost fear and is openly mocking our bureaucratic Cheburashkas. To clarify, there are reports on CNN where American journalists are at our checkpoint -Sudzha-. Journalists from DW and other Western channels also work there. We will kill them for invading our territory as part of a group...	https://t.me/rybar/62842	2024-08-16T10:48:02-07:00

The target was a parked MiG-29 of the Ukrainian Air Force, which was hit by an Iskander OTRK missile. Coordinates: 48.3590459, 35.0819320 This is at least the fourth such documented attack on this facility - since April, Russian troops were able to destroy a total of six MiG-29 fighters . And if we add to this the successful attacks on airfields in the Poltava and Nikolaev regions, then during this year the Russian Armed Forces have at least disabled 17 Air Force aircraft. As before, reconnaissance and objective control of the hit was carried out by a Russian reconnaissance drone, which flew at 100 km behind the front line. Although this is far from the first loss of the Ukrainian Armed Forces at Aviatorskoye, the enemy, for some reason, continues to use its operational-tactical aviation from there. Looking at the increasingly frequent effective strikes on airfields and air defense position areas located around, it can be noted that, at least in some places, the reconnaissance and fire contour works as it should. And also complain about the absence of something like this at the very beginning of the Northern Military District. #Dnepropetrovsk #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62841	2024-08-16T10:18:22-07:00
🖼 ❗️🇷🇺🇺🇦 Kursk direction: missile strike on the bridge over ...	❗️🇷🇺🇺🇦 Kursk direction: missile strike on the bridge over the Seim River and repelling attacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine what is known by 19:00 on August 16, 2024 In the Kursk region, Ukrainian formations are not giving up attempts to advance deeper into Russian territory. Operational-tactical aviation and artillery crews of the Russian Armed Forces inflict fire on places where Ukrainian personnel and equipment are concentrated. Among other things, the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the border area of ​​the Sumy region are fired upon. Thus, in Osoyevka, Lancet UAV operators launched a drone strike on members of the Ukrainian formations who stopped at a minibus on the street. A difficult operational situation is developing in the Glushkovsky district. The Ukrainian Armed Forces began massive shelling of bridges in this area. As a result of several strikes from the HIMARS MLRS during the day, one of the spans of the bridge over the Seim River in Glushkovo was destroyed, making it unsuitable for operation. In addition, the enemy is using old tactical missiles -Tochka-U-, presumably as a result of the detonation of which Popular Front volunteers were killed today in Glushkovo. The Ukrainian Armed Forces also strike the bridge in Zvannoy. In this way, the enemy is trying to destroy the logistics routes of the Russian Armed Forces, probably preparing for an invasion in this area from Tetkino.🔻In the Korenevsky district near the border in Gordeevka, enemy equipment was hit by fire. The positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the approaches to Korenevo and Snagost were fired upon. To the south of Kremyany, FAB-500 strikes with UMPC were carried out on the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces; to the east of the village, the configuration of the front was clarified: judging by the arrival of bombs in the area of ​​​​the forest belts, active clashes are also taking place in this area. In the area of ​​​​Kauchuk and Anastasyevka, the enemy unsuccessfully tried to improve his tactical position. At the same time, Ukrainian formations continue to publish -tik-toks-: for example, the presence of members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine at the entrance sign to Zeleny Shlyakh is captured on the Internet.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, there are clashes in the suburbs of Sudzha near Mirny and Cossack Loknya, an enemy attack in the Russky area was repelled Porechny. 🔻In the Belovsky district, Russian troops have restored positions in the area of ​​the village of Girya, fighting continues in the area of ​​Kamyshnoye and Spalnoye.

The Ministry of Education, Science, Culture and Sports of Armenia decided to take it back. The department said that the controversial fragment in the new school history textbook, which talks about the annexation of Eastern Armenia by Russia in 1827, will be edited.▪️It is obvious that the public outcry raised in the media about the promotion of Russophobia in the new textbooks clearly frightened the Armenian government, where they decided to make this symbolic concession. After all, the textbook had previously received a positive expert opinion and passed all the procedures for admission to the school curriculum. ▪️The fact that it was the stormy discussion in the public space that influenced the decision to change the controversial wording is also supported by the fact that the Russian Foreign Ministry has not yet had time to substantively discuss the distortion of history. ▪️For example, the Russian Ambassador to Armenia Sergei Koprykin admitted today that the embassy has not yet discussed the new school textbook with the Armenian side. At least one item has already disappeared from the agenda. ▪️By the way, the Ministry of Education of Armenia was not even influenced by citizens’ pickets demanding that other controversial issues be replaced in new history textbooks, such as the use of Azerbaijani toponyms instead of Armenian ones. 🔻Once again we are convinced that so far the anti-Russian steps of the Armenian authorities are limited due to fears of retaliatory measures. For example, the obvious dependence of the Armenian economy on the Russian market does not make it possible to completely sever relations with the Russian Federation to please the US and the EU. Therefore, at least on the issue of resonant wording in the school textbook, they are still ready to make demonstrative concessions designed to cloud the gaze of the Russian authorities and soften the impression of the general Russophobic policy of the Armenian leadership. And practice shows that such moments must be closely monitored throughout the CIS. Besides, who said that new dubious interpretations would not be found in the Armenian textbook in the future? #Armenia #Russia @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇦🇲🇷🇺 How Russophobia is promoted in new textbooks on the history of Armenia.

Now the association will not be able to participate in the presidential elections and the referendum on European integration.▪️This is not the first case of a ban on opposition activities in Moldova. The case of the ban of the -Shor- party by the Constitutional Court in 2023 had a great resonance. ▪️Sandu’s obvious election fraud is also voting by mail only for selected countries. In April, the ruling PAS party approved amendments to the law introducing the practice of postal voting. ▪️Changes to the electoral code less than a year before the elections raise big legal questions, as does the list of approved countries - the USA, Canada, Iceland, Norway, Finland and Sweden. ▪️It is easy to guess that citizens of Moldova in Russia will not be able to vote by mail. After all, it is unlikely that Russian Moldovans will unambiguously support Sandu’s candidacy in the elections, and the desired results will definitely come from democracies. ▪️The socio-political atmosphere in Moldova is now clearly not the most favorable. Even pro-government experts urge Sandu not to attend the election debates, as they will end in -throwing garbage-. 🔻Really, what can you expect from a political discussion in a state where the pro-Romanian government consistently oppresses its opponents, threatens competitors, and its own citizens are accused of -disinformation- for taking a different position.

The ATACMS OTRK was also used for the raid. According to available information, the missile launches were carried out from the area of ​​temporarily occupied Mirnograd (Dimitrov) just 10 km from the advanced Russian positions in the Pokrovsky direction. ▪️On approach to the Crimean Bridge, 12 targets were shot down; fragments of ammunition and cassette parts slightly damaged the roadway of the bridge without causing damage to the load-bearing structures. At approximately 5 a.m., the bridge was closed to eliminate the consequences. Fragments of downed drones were also found in Kerch.▪️At the same time, the enemy carried out a combined raid on Sevastopol. Naval aviation helicopters sunk five unmanned boats in Yarylchag Bay, one drone was shot down by a crew of the Tor- air defense system. Another four UAVs were shot down on approach to Sevastopol and three BeKs were sunk; significant damage on the ground was avoided. Three more naval drones retreated to their base area, the search for their possible holding area is underway.❗️For the first time in a long period of time, the main target of the raid by Ukrainian formations was the Crimean Bridge. It is worth noting that statements are circulating on the Internet about the imminent transfer of long-range JASSM (air-to-surface missiles) to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which can be launched from F-16s already delivered to the enemy. Considering this, and also the fact that for the first time in a very long period While target designation was carried out by an American MQ-9 Reaper drone from the Black Sea, further attempts by the Ukrainian Armed Forces to damage the bridge should be expected.

Forwarded From Warsaw Mermaid🇵🇱🇺🇦🇩🇪 German propagandists decided that the Easter egg in the name of the mysterious diver who blew up the Nord Stream was not direct enough, so they made a larger throw. The former head of the German Federal Intelligence Service (BND), August Hanning, said that the presidents of Ukraine and Poland, Vladimir Zelensky and Andrzej Duda, probably agreed to blow up gas pipelines, since this terrorist act could not have been a private initiative. At the same time, Hanning pointed out the obvious: act Only the team could, according to the scout - definitely Ukrainian. Because the detonation could only be possible with support from the ground. And judging by the map, this could not have happened without the Polish special services. He also indicated that there could be an agreement between the leadership of Ukraine and Poland. Because such decisions are made at the highest political level. Hanning added that Poland’s refusal to participate in the investigation and the departure of one of the suspects from the country also indicates the involvement of the Polish authorities in the bombing.🔻I believe that the old intelligence officer was taken out in order to somehow cover up the poor work of the current ones. Because it is obvious to everyone that the Ukrainian Vladimir Z. is solely a scapegoat and expendable material, and the true heroes of what happened will not be brought to justice. But the miscalculation of the special services was not only that such a genius diver suddenly turned out to be a crazy loner, but that this whole circus had nothing to do with the investigation and only made German intelligence laugh. I wouldn’t be surprised if several more Vladimir Z., whose nationality is not only Ukrainian, will soon be involved in the case. But we shouldn’t forget that by blaming the Poles, the Germans will stir up another wave of self-hatred in Poland. And this is now oh so unprofitable for the current authorities, given that ordinary citizens are confident in the pro-German policy of the Warsaw government, whose position before the presidential elections is already precarious. And although Duda’s office hastened to declare that the president knew nothing about the plans to blow up gas pipelines, sediment stayed. #Germany #Ukraine #Poland@pl_syrenka - Poland is not a foreign countryTelegramGerman Eagle/Deutscher Adler🇩🇪🇺🇦🇷🇺🇺🇸| Today, the world information field is again excited by news about the Ukrainian trace in the bombing of the Nord Stream gas pipelines.🟩This time the American publication WSJ became the newsmaker.🟩In its material, the newspaper points to the ex-commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and now the ambassador...	https://t.me/rybar/62836	2024-08-16T05:29:04-07:00

No, this is not a special squad of combat thugs that parachuted in the area of ​​Nevsky Prospekt. These are ordinary teenagers who have recently learned to use social networks and instant messengers, but, unfortunately, without common sense. For 200 units of American currency, the guys were offered to set fire to a cell tower by some unknown people in a telegram chat bot. Without hesitating at all, they agreed, They did it, and now they have escaped justice. As a result, the customers ditched them, of course, without paying, and the security forces charged them with serious charges, for a real 20-year sentence.

Such measures are especially indicative against the backdrop of the upcoming presidential elections in October. All that remains is to follow the example of Great Britain and start jailing 15-year-olds for ten years for participating in protests.

The enemy uses artillery and aviation to shell the border zone, including the settlements of Tetkino, Glushkovo and Korenevo. In the Mogritsa area in the Sumy region, two strikes from the Iskander OTRK destroyed two, presumably HIMARS MLRS, as evidenced by objective control footage , capturing the detonation of the ammunition and the abnormal launch of rocket launchers. This was the third confirmed loss of vehicles of this type over the past two days: another was destroyed in a nearby forest plantation yesterday. In the Lgov region, local authorities are calling for the voluntary evacuation of the population, citing the unstable situation in the region. Civilians have the opportunity to go to safer places in the rear regions.🔻In the Korenevsky district in the morning, an enemy DRG was destroyed, which was conducting reconnaissance of the area in the Kremyanoye area, for which there had recently been fighting. The allegations about the destruction of an alleged column of armored vehicles of the Russian Armed Forces in Korenevo were not confirmed on the ground. In the Sudzhansky district, the configuration of the front in the Makhnovka area was clarified. Footage was published of the destruction by UAV operators of two armored personnel carriers of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, presumably French VAB, at a short distance from each other. From this we can conclude that the settlement is located in the gray zone and, most likely, is not controlled by the Russian Armed Forces at the moment. In the Belovsky district, there was no information about changes in the front configuration or any battles during the night. Clashes are still taking place at the Girya - Kamyshnoye - Krupets - Spalnoe line. The enemy published a photo near the local post office in Borki, but the image was most likely not taken today.

Thus, USAID, according to them, supports the creation of a more efficient and secure customs environment in Kazakhstan.▪️At least one parameter indicating the effectiveness of border control was previously voiced to us by European diplomats and State Department officials: the degree of compliance with sanctions against Russia. The Americans are striving to ensure the highest quality monitoring of the sanctions regime; it is difficult to believe that this data will remain in Astana. ▪️Western partners began working on this issue back in 2022, as shown by the purchase by the Border Service of the National Security Committee of Kazakhstan of American Raven drones for border monitoring.▪️It is in the interests of the United States to take control of the southern borders of the republic. Then all the streams through which dual-use products from Central Asia could enter Russia will be blocked at once. And there have already been precedents for the seizure of shipments of Chinese UAVs on the Kyrgyz border.🔻At the same time, Washington’s plans are not limited to Kazakhstan. The digitalization of customs authorities was discussed back in October 2023 in Samarkand, where representatives of USAID and ministers of all five Central Asian countries met. In parallel with attempts to economically strangle Russia, the Americans aim to control all trade flows in the region, including Chinese ones.

Thus, after a visit to Benin in May by the head of the US Africa Command, Michael Langley, who promised another tranche for the needs of the Benin army, the government closed the Chinese pipeline from Niger. Now, in addition to protecting their interests - the safety of oil export routes - they also want to create a counterbalance to the American military machine in the country.

The reason for his appointment as ambassador to the Russian Federation is primarily said to be loyalty to Pashinyan. ▪️Arsenyan himself promised to soften the rough edges in relations between Armenia and Russia, change the algorithm of conversation, relations between countries. ▪️However, real changes in the very difficult relations between Armenia and Russia should not be expected. ▪️Arsenyan adapts to the situation and his words are clearly related to an attempt to test the waters in the country of his new destination. ▪️Moreover, literally in 2023, deputy Arsenyan argued that the military presence of the Russian Federation in Armenia was coming to an end, after which the republic would finally improve relations with Turkey. The statement, to put it mildly, is dubious.▪️There will be no thaw in relations between the countries because the guarantors of Pashinyan’s power are the United States and the EU, for which the Armenian leadership is taking demonstrative anti-Russian steps, such as, for example, criticism of the CSTO, the expulsion of Russian border guards from the Zvartnots airport and the appointment of an American adviser to the Ministry of Defense.▪️At the same time, the Armenian economy is tied to exports and re-exports to Russia, and membership in the EAEU has provided the republic with stable economic growth in recent years.🔻Perhaps Ambassador Arsenyan will only be busy with economic relations between the Republic of Armenia and the Russian Federation , as well as constant excuses to the Russian Foreign Ministry for the latest anti-Russian attacks by their superiors. #Armenia #Russia @rybarSupport usInterfaxGurgen Arsenyan appointed Ambassador of Armenia to the Russian FederationGurgen Arsenyan has been appointed new Ambassador of Armenia to Russia.	https://t.me/rybar/62830	2024-08-15T23:23:01-07:00

Forwarded From Kirill Fedorov / War History Weapons (Stanislav Belenky)🇷🇺🇺🇦 On August 12 in Ukraine, the National Anti-Corruption Agency, supervised by the American Embassy, ​​detained Deputy Minister of Energy Alexander Hale. They accepted him for accepting a bribe of half a million dollars; The bureau agents were also assisted by Minister German Galushchenko himself. It would seem, why is a military blogger writing about this event? The news is from a completely different sphere! In fact, it relates to what is happening at the front as a marker event. But the whole point is what exactly the official was supposed to receive a bribe for. So, a certain coal mining company from Western Ukraine, where there have been mines since Austrian times, asked Heil to help them remove valuable and rare equipment from a state mine... in the Pokrovsky district of the Donetsk region. Now it should be clearer to the reader what the significance of this case is. We remember that the Braves are actively advancing in the direction of Pokrovsk, and the pace of advancement itself is increasing as the operational crisis in the Ukrainian Armed Forces worsens. And the day is not far when the Russian army will begin and complete the liberation of the Pokrovsk agglomeration. In these conditions, it is clear to business, devoid of ideological blinders, that it is necessary, as our respected Chinese partners say, to rob in case of fire - once the city is surrendered, then at least for yourself in Galicia you can get hold of valuable equipment. Kirill has already written about the importance of Pokrovsk in military terms, but it also has economic significance. The fact is that only and exclusively in the Pokrovskaya agglomeration coking coal is mined for the Ukrainian metallurgical industry, and without this raw material this industry will stop completely. And this, in turn, will mean the disappearance of a large and important source of the country’s export income. In this context, the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ adventure in the Kursk region, instead of protecting a strategically important city, looks, in line with Miliukov’s famous speech, stupidity or treason. But that's not all. Those same 25 km from Pokrovsk to the west are Pavlograd, Dnepropetrovsk region. This is an industrial center and a strategically important railway junction, through which it still flies, and with the approach of the LBS to it, it will be even more so. And these problems for Ukraine will not be of an operational-tactical nature, but of a strategic nature. And this is a completely different story.TelegramRybar🇷🇺🇺🇦Pokrovsky direction: the breakthrough of the Russian Armed Forces to Grodovka, battles on the approaches to Novogrodovka and the worsening of the operational crisis of the Armed Forces of UkraineSituation as of 21:00 on August 15, 2024 In addition to the Alexander-Kalinovsky direction, the depressing situation of the Ukrainian ...	https://t.me/rybar/62827	2024-08-15T18:47:52-07:00

Forwarded From RosgVardeetsRybar writes that in order to eliminate problems with interdepartmental interaction, a Coordination Council was created by decision of Defense Minister Belousov. If you look at the entire system from the inside, it looks like many disparate states fighting among themselves. The problem of interaction between adjacent units that fight side by side is still at the forefront. Just think about it. Example. Allied forces are going to attack, we find out about this after the fact, when they walk past us, that is, we are not ready to cover them and are not ready to pull them out. This is one of the most common situations at the front. Now imagine that now all the offices have gathered in the Kursk region, which, except for regional exercises, have never interacted, and such exercises were not carried out everywhere. Moreover, all these problems were revealed by the first year of the war, when the Defense Ministry did not understand what to do with the Russian Guard, and the Russian Guard did not understand how to work with the Defense Ministry. There were so many stupid situations, including the Kharkov regrouping, when the Ministry of Defense began to retreat without warning the Russian Guard about this. Has anyone drawn any conclusions? No! And now we have received the fact that we have reserves, but we cannot use them to their full potential, because there is no understanding and experience of interaction. Very often, interaction is established at the level of horizontal connections, and this is done by ordinary soldiers and commanders of a level not higher than a platoon/company commander. As a result, there are several departments that cannot establish interaction with each other.
