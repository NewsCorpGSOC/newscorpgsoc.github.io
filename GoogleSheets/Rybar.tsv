The media write that Donald Trump’s team does not want to take part in the event at this site, because they allegedly do not agree with the conditions. Democrats claim that this is because of the rule about microphones being on - allegedly, Republicans are worried that Trump will say too much. In turn, Jason Miller, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, said that they have already agreed to the ABC debate under the same conditions. like the CNN debate. The Harris camp, having already agreed to CNN's rules, asked for the debate to be held seated, with notes and opening statements.

🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦💡 Strikes by the Russian Armed Forces against targets...	🇷🇺🇺🇦💡 Strikes by the Russian Armed Forces against targets in the so-called territory. Ukraine on August 26 - what is known by 17:00 The Internet continues to actively discuss the massive strike of Russian troops on enemy targets in the so-called territory. Ukraine. And although a significant part of the targets remains unknown, against the backdrop of the images that have appeared, some results of the raid can already be summed up. ▪️In Kyiv, industrial institutions specializing in the production and modernization of aviation ammunition were hit, among them the Research Institute of Aviation Technology, which is part of the so-called military-industrial complex. Ukraine. There are also reports of a series of explosions in the area of ​​Zhulyany airport. In Vyshgorod, a northern suburb of the Ukrainian capital, one of the missiles hit a turbine room on the dam of the Kyiv reservoir. A fire broke out on the premises. However, it is still difficult to determine the extent of damage based on the available footage. At the same time, the Ukrainian authorities have already stated that the dam has not received significant damage, and traffic along it will be restored in the coming hours. ▪️In the Odessa region, Russian troops attacked a warehouse south of the village of Usatovo and an electrical substation of the same name. After the arrivals, a wave of emergency power outages occurred throughout Odessa. ▪️In the west the so-called. In Ukraine, one of the hits was on the Khmelnitsky 330 substation, which resulted in an emergency power outage in at least part of the Khmelnitsky region. In the administrative center, power outages led to a stop in the movement of trolleybuses.▪️In the Sumy region, the railway infrastructure, which is actively used by Ukrainian formations, including for the transfer of additional forces to the Russian border, was hit. ▪️In the Dnepropetrovsk region, the energy infrastructure was attacked. Information is also being received about a hit on the territory of the Dnepropetrovsk International Airport. ▪️Not far from Vinnitsa, according to monitoring resources, a fire was recorded on the territory of the Vinnitsa 750 PS. Another hit was on the Bar 330 PS.▪️Critical infrastructure facilities were hit in the Zhytomyr, Nikolaev, Poltava and Lviv regions. There is also unconfirmed information about a hit on the Trikhaty 330 substation in the Nikolaev region and the Pervomaiskaya 330 substation in the Dnepropetrovsk region.▪️According to the Ukrainian authorities and media, power outages occurred throughout Ukraine. At the same time, problems with water supply are recorded in seven regions: Dnepropetrovsk, Kyiv, Vinnitsa, Zhytomyr, Rivne, Volyn and Lviv regions.❗️At the same time, we note that it is beneficial for the enemy to exaggerate the degree of problems so that damaged or surviving objects are among the targets planned for today added to the list of destroyed. This can also be carried out with the aim of obtaining supplies of much-needed air defense systems. 🔻The new massive strike by the Russian Armed Forces also reminded us of long-rooted formulations - each such raid is presented as part of some kind of -act of retaliation- for any enemy aggression. So, not only a significant part of the patriotic channels, but also quite official speakers connected the new attack with revenge for the Kursk region. Against this background, let us ask a question that has already set the teeth on edge: Do we expect certain actions from the Ukrainian formations in order to justify strikes on enemy targets? Be that as it may, only the systematic destruction of targets can cause significant damage - this is what is worth continuing to do, instead of playing by someone else’s rules and looking for excuses for another massive raid.

One of them was almost a year-long filming from the Havana Bridge in Kyiv, which demonstrates several hits on objects in the Ukrainian capital, including the Artem plant. In the Russian segment, many took this video at face value and -swallowed the bait- - it was actively disseminated as confirmation of the effectiveness of the raid, although it had nothing in common with it. The goals of such enemy tricks are obvious - he is trying to confuse Russian troops with massive hits on the same military -industrial facilities in Kyiv.

Its format did not allow for discussion of a wide range of issues, but for our team it was the first such event with the participation of a sitting leader of a foreign state. Among other things, one point really caught my eye: al-Sudani especially focused on the importance of the media and creating conditions for inviting foreign journalists instead of obstructing them. According to him, this is how it will be possible to break the prevailing stereotypes in the press about the state of affairs in Iraq and create a positive image of the country in the world. At the same time, the very fact that the head of state invites representatives of the Russian information and analytical media network to a meeting speaks of a certain understanding by Iraqi authorities on the role of Telegram in the modern information war. The importance of which in the al-Sudani administration, apparently, is generally understood. And if so, then specific points of contact in this area may well be found. #Iraq #media technologies #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63068	2024-08-26T05:44:18-07:00

According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, a total of 22 drones were intercepted over eight regions. ▪️This time the main blow fell on the Saratov region, where the Volga Sky residential complex on Predmostovaya Square in Saratov and a multi-storey building in the center of Engels came under attack. Four civilians were injured, one woman was hospitalized in serious condition. The most likely target of the enemy was the Engels strategic aviation airfield - it itself had already been repeatedly attacked by Ukrainian Armed Forces drones, which flew at a low enough altitude to minimize the possibility of detection. ▪️Another enemy drone was intercepted on approach to Yaroslavl. According to some reports, Ukrainian formations tried to strike a local oil refinery. There was no destruction or casualties at the site where the debris fell.▪️In the Belgorod region, on the Krasnaya Yaruga-Vyazovoe highway section, two FPV drones of the Ukrainian Armed Forces attacked a passenger car: two civilians were injured and were hospitalized. ▪️Air defense systems also worked in the Kursk, Bryansk, Tula, Oryol and Ryazan regions. There, according to preliminary information, there were no injuries or injuries. 🔻Recently, Ukrainian formations have been steadily choosing either fuel and energy complex facilities or military airfields as the main targets of drone attacks. At the same time, the raids themselves are carried out almost one after another, which once again indicates the high volume of drone production by the enemy and his intention to tirelessly launch UAVs.

In Russian telegram channels they did not fail to notice a very obvious fact: equipping even a hundred pickup trucks with similar means would be significantly cheaper than losing another oil depot, like the one that has been burning for more than a week near Proletarsk. The possibility of creating such an ersatz air defense has been discussed almost since the first attacks of Ukrainian drones on targets in Russia, but without practical results. Somewhere, for example, in Crimea, there are such mobile groups, and they are quite effective in countering drones. In addition, even if we don’t have to talk about the complete destruction of the enemy’s production facilities, I would like to note the following: if massive strikes were a regular practice, and not one-time actions -retribution-, the Ukrainian Armed Forces would have many times fewer opportunities for strikes.#Russia #Ukraine @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63061	2024-08-26T03:00:36-07:00
🇬🇧On the British government's reaction to the riots At the end ...	🇬🇧On the British government's response to the riots At the end of July, after a 17-year-old teenager attacked children with a knife in Southport, large-scale protests broke out in many UK cities, which escalated into riots and clashes with the police. To suppress the protests, the British government deployed 6,000 specialist police officers. Relative calm was achieved only after harsh exemplary sentences and the launch of an information campaign to intimidate the rioters. As a result, since July 29, more than 1,000 arrests have been made and&nbsp; over 600 charges. Over 300 people are currently in custody, and this figure is not final. Of course, the penitentiary system, which has accumulated many problems, could not -digest- such an influx of criminals, so the government had to look for additional places in prisons by early releasing some prisoners. 📌The release of criminals from prison is a strong element of pressure on the population and allows the country's citizens to be distracted from the flaws of the authorities' policies. Well, such measures pursue a number of unobvious goals. Firstly, staying in prison will protect right-wing activists from physical harm that could overtake them on the street. Secondly, being in prison will allow them to get to know each other and consolidate.🔻Thus, a significant number of supporters of anti-migrant protests will be intimidated by imprisonment, and the most proactive activists will become more united, which will allow them to be used in their own interests. A completely logical question immediately arises -What would this be for?-.#Great Britain@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇬🇧 Protests against migrants in the UK We recently watched as migrants organized riots in Leeds after social services attempted to remove children from disadvantaged families.

Ukraine on August 26 - what is known by 10:30 Early this morning, Russian troops launched a series of massive attacks on various targets on the territory of almost the entire so-called. Ukraine. The targets of the raid included energy infrastructure facilities and air defense position areas.▪️A series of explosions occurred in more than ten regions, including Kharkov, Vinnitsa, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kyiv and Dnepropetrovsk regions. ▪️A wide range of attack means is used for fire destruction: from kamikaze drones of the Geranium family to cruise and ballistic missiles. ▪️According to preliminary information, an industrial facility in the Poltava region, substations in Rivne and Odessa, and energy infrastructure in Lutsk were also affected. ▪️Against the background of the raid, Ukrenergo ordered emergency power outages throughout Ukraine: local residents reported a lack of power in Lviv, Khmelnitsky, Zhytomyr, Odessa and many other cities. ▪️There were also problems with water supply, including in four districts of the Ukrainian capital: Shevchenkovsky, Svyatoshinsky, Solomensky and Goloseevsky. At the same time, it is reported that it hit the territory of the Kyiv Zhulyany airport and an as yet unidentified energy system facility. ▪️There were also power outages on the railway infrastructure, and backup diesel locomotives were introduced.🔻Nevertheless, the emergency power outages introduced by the Ukrainian authorities are, first of all, precautionary measures. At the same time, the enemy may try to confuse Russian troops about the supposedly large-scale consequences of the raid in order to convince them of the defeat of all targets. Therefore, at the moment, the damage caused has yet to be confirmed. In addition, such massive strikes must be systematic: long-term disruption of the energy infrastructure will significantly complicate logistics, as well as the repair of equipment and the work of the enemy’s industry. #digest #Russia #Ukraine #electricity @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63055	2024-08-26T00:45:56-07:00

The Chinese consider it theirs and want to take it back. The Americans obviously support independence, so for them the Taiwan Strait is international waters through which they supposedly have the right to move. Such actions by the US Navy occur with enviable regularity, on average twice a year. And every time everything follows the same scenario: the destroyer goes through the strait, and the PLA reaction is monitored by the RC-135. This time, the Chinese side sent J-16 fighters to protect the airspace, and its own aircraft to track the ship and the reconnaissance aircraft long-range radar detection KJ-500. Although this increases the degree of tension between countries, this is all commonplace. Therefore, when you see news marked lightning that the Americans are provoking China, you can safely ignore it.

Russian troops are pushing through the defenses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces both in Novogrodovka itself and from the flanks, trying to take the city into a semi-ring. Ukrainian formations, deprived of their usual advantage in the form of well-fortified defensive lines, are gradually retreating on several sectors of the front at once. ▪️Advanced units of the Russian Armed Forces advanced at the Krutoy Yar - Krasny Yar line, gaining a foothold on the southeastern outskirts of the latter. Russian troops are actively using artillery and UAVs to suppress Ukrainian Armed Forces firing points, which allows attack aircraft to clear enemy positions without significant problems. Some sources are already reporting about the control of the Russian Armed Forces over both settlements, but it has not yet been possible to confirm this information with objective control personnel. ❗️The liberation of Krutoy and Krasny Yarov will allow the Russian Armed Forces to begin storming the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the waste heap of the Novogrodovskaya-No. 3 mine. This height serves as the key to forming the northern front of the half-environment of Novogrodovka and the enemy units located in the city. ▪️In Novogrodovka itself, Russian attack aircraft are rapidly overcoming the enemy’s defensive lines. We can speak with confidence about the control of the Russian Armed Forces over Michurin and Turgenev streets, as well as about the beginning of battles for Molodezhnaya Street. According to some reports, advanced Russian assault groups have already reached the central part of the city and started fighting there. Information is being circulated on the Internet about Russian troops occupying enemy positions in the area of ​​the crossing on the western outskirts of the city and separate rifle battles to the north, in the area of ​​the substation on Nekrasov Street. Probably, we are talking about Russian DRGs disrupting supplies and attacking key defense centers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and not about linear units capable of gaining a foothold in the sector. Despite the spreading panic in the enemy’s information space, it is premature to talk about control of the Russian Armed Forces over the city. Most reports of Russian units entering certain areas of a populated area come from disoriented local residents who do not have proper information about the situation in the city. ▪️To the south, Russian troops are fighting on the approaches to the Kotlyarevskaya mine, the capture of which will simplify the offensive on this section of the front. The advanced assault troops advanced close to the Mikhailovka railway station and physically cut off the M-30 highway, along which enemy units were supplied on the northern flank of the Donetsk direction.▪️At the Karlovka-Memrik line, Russian troops significantly expanded the zone of control, developing an offensive from Ptichye to Kalinovo, and also significantly advanced north along the Karlovskoye Reservoir after the capture of Skuchny. ❗️According to some information, Russian troops are actively attacking from the flanks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ defensive lines in the Kalinovo area, trying to bypass and isolate enemy strongholds. He, in turn, is making attempts to prevent the Russian Armed Forces from breaking through to the M-30 highway and their advance on Galitsynovka.

In the Kursk region, Russian troops continue to hold back the enemy’s onslaught, inflicting significant losses on Ukrainian formations along the entire length of the contact line.🔻In In the Korenevsky district, the Russian Armed Forces regained control over Olgovka, the battle for which took place several days ago. Apparently, after losing a large number of armored vehicles and manpower in the village and district, the Ukrainian Armed Forces were forced to retreat. On the approaches to Korenevo and Zeleny Shlyakh, two BMP-1 BMP-1s were hit by FPV drones. The Armed Forces of Ukraine do not give up attempts to enter directly into Korenevo itself, but all their attacks are successfully repulsed.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, fighting is still going on in the Malaya Lokni area. All attempts by the enemy to enter and gain a foothold in the village were stopped; it is under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. In the area of ​​Martynovka and Russky Porechny, clashes continue. In the area, there is an increase in the intensity of artillery shelling on Russian positions, which is associated with the transfer of additional guns by Ukrainian formations from other sectors of the front.🔻Russian troops continue systematic work to destroy air defense systems and radar stations in the Sumy region . UAV operators hit the Lancet ST-68 radar of the Ukrainian Armed Forces with a kamikaze drone near Shevchenkovo ​​in the Sumy region. In the morning, the Buk-M1 air defense system was hit in Gritsenkovo.

All this has already become so familiar that it is not surprising. And the last few days have been no exception. The other day, a pair of American B-2A bombers, the flight of which we talked about a few days ago, flew to the Bay of Bengal in transit through the Diego Garcia airbase on the Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean. Nothing supernatural happened. On such business trips, bomber flights are a standard procedure to demonstrate the strength and power of the United States and do not serve any other purpose.❗️However, the flight area surprisingly (not) coincided with the Falcon Strike exercise of Chinese and Thai military personnel currently taking place in Thailand. Considering that Thailand is also part of the confrontation zone between the two powers, the provocative flight of the B-2A may be closely related to this. The Chinese are using Jian-10 fighters and Jianhong-7A fighter-bombers, and the Thais are using AlphaJet attack aircraft . The main point is the joint use of aviation in the event of a crisis situation in the region.▪️In addition, in India, the multinational Tarang Shakti exercise is currently ongoing in the state of Tamil Nadu. Remember, this is an event in which the French, Germans and Spaniards participate as part of a round-the-world flight of their military aircraft. There was no official talk about the participation of the Americans, but to support their NATO allies, as well as to show their -good- intentions to the Celestial Empire (which consists of tensions with India) - why not?High resolution mapEnglish version#Australia #China #USA #Thailand@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63043	2024-08-25T07:04:53-07:00

The capabilities of the radar will allow the Alliance to cover a wide range of tasks both in identifying surface targets and air targets . And there is no need to explain who all this will be aimed at. And these are by no means pacifist tasks. With the advent of F-16 fighters, this radar will significantly simplify the work of Ukrainian formations in targeting the now important Crimea and Kherson region. An interesting situation arises. There are more and more military equipment off the Russian coast. After all, this station is just the tip of the iceberg. There are also dozens of drones and planes, not to mention satellites.

A lot has changed here since our last visit, and for the better. So, Baghdad... 🇮🇶🇷🇺 During our visit to Iraq, we were able to meet with Ayad Alavi, the country’s first prime minister after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein’s regime in 2003. We talked with him on various topics - from the events of the American occupation and efforts to restore the country to what is happening in the Northern Military District zone. During a very pleasant conversation, the topic of the Russian presence in Iraq was also raised. The politician’s opinion on this matter was unequivocal: although there are points of contact and good relations, the volume of interaction between states is modest, and firms from Russia show much less interest in the country than even small countries in distant Europe. Alas, so far it’s mostly just a matter of making hands. In many countries of the Middle East and the global south in general, Russian companies are indeed expected at least as an alternative to American, British and Chinese corporations. But even in hydrocarbon-rich and - unlike many - solvent Iraq, the great potential for cooperation has been realized at a meager percentage. Of course, I would like to believe that some of the processes currently taking place will change the situation. However, here it is most appropriate to remember the saying - Strike while the iron is hot - especially in light of the fact that foreign policy realities can be changeable.#Iraq #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63041	2024-08-25T04:42:47-07:00

🇺🇸🇬🇧🇫🇷❤About the beneficiaries of the arrest of Pavel Durov...	🇺🇸🇬🇧🇫🇷❤About the beneficiaries of the arrest of Pavel Durov Less than two months have passed since the day Donald Trump almost went to jail, when the left in the West had a new victim - the head of Telegram, Pavel Durov. Telegram has long become a bone in the throat American and European governments and intelligence services - in the United States and the European Union, the platform took the shape of an emerging stronghold - freedom of speech - under the conditions of the most severe and total control by X (formerly Twitter), recognized as extremist in the Russian Federation by Meta and Google. In the United States, cleared after the events of 6 January 2021, the right-wing movement almost completely moved to Telegram and from there broadcast to an audience of thousands. Coordination between activists continued, the truth about the rigged 2020 elections by Joe Biden’s team was spreading to the people - the Democrats could not allow this.📌The operation to suppress Telegram, apparently, was agreed upon and planned in advance, since a few days before Durov’s arrest major American conservative channels faced bans in mobile applications and blocking of personal accounts of owners. In connection with, most likely, a temporary problem with the lack of keys to the messenger, the following scheme was used: troll farms (mainly consisting of volunteers from various left-liberal organizations that flooded Twitter) were hired en masse, through which they attacked one or another channel/account reports. There are also big questions about what guided the moderators who satisfied such suspicious and massive complaints. It is noteworthy that this happened not only in the USA: inconvenient channels are also eliminated in the UK in a similar way. Ultimately, the situation with Durov only confirms the fact that no matter how influential a person is, it will not be possible to remain a third party in a big game. Despite all their financial power, neither Elon Musk nor Mark Zuckerberg could escape cooperation with the American government. Even the billionaire who challenged the swamp and, for a moment, the 45th American president, Donald Trump, was seriously injured. The two chairs seen at Durov’s interview with Tucker Carlson perfectly personified the essence and rules of survival in big politics. Where Paul, who realized this, made a mistake is not yet clear. What is known is that third parties usually end up the way Julian Assange did. #globalism #UK #USA #France@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport usTelegramAmerican number🇺🇸🙍‍♂ Yesterday Donald Trump celebrated his next legal success - the US Supreme Court ruled that a politician, as a former president, has partial immunity from legal prosecution, which applies to his actions within the scope of his official duties...	https://t.me/rybar/63039	2024-08-25T02:13:21-07:00

Military messengers exist and are used, of course they are inferior to the cart in functionality and flexibility/ease of starting to use: military messengers cannot just be downloaded and installed on any Android iPhone, you need to obtain licenses, keys and solve a number of organizational issues (which is the most important and problematic thing), and the GUS has fully implemented them in different directions of the front, but there are nuances.. As for the DSS/SPSO, all existing systems have their own tactical chat.. and in some already a full-fledged messenger, but I’ll keep quiet about this for now😏😉 And this type of open source software, such as a messenger in a separate form, is also definitely needed..

Forwarded From Two Majors #Review #Summary for August 25, 2024▪️ The third week of repelling the armed invasion of the Ukrainian Armed Forces into the territory of the Kursk region of the Russian Federation is ending. The enemy is constrained by the fighting and is suffering significant losses in men and equipment, but is trying to move forward, although the previous breakthroughs of its combat reconnaissance patrols have been localized. Heavy, high-intensity battles are taking place simultaneously in a number of settlements in the region; the Russian Armed Forces have brought up reserves, incl. 11th Brigade After the destruction of bridges in the Glushkovsky region, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are launching attacks from MLRS -HIMARS- on our river crossings, limiting the possibility of removing civilians and complicating military logistics. The heads of Lgov and Korenevsky district recommended that residents not return until the situation stabilizes; the expediency of this is confirmed by the shelling of Lgov.▪️ The enemy retains offensive potential in other directions. Thus, information is received about the enemy’s plans to attack the Bryansk region, the accumulation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kamensk direction of the Zaporozhye Front and the preparation of an amphibious operation on the spits in the Kherson region. Apparently, the Russian Armed Forces are managing to disrupt the plans of the Ukrainian Armed Forces by launching missile strikes against the concentration of enemy forces. However, the enemy’s attack on the ferry in the port of Caucasus cannot be called harmless either▪️ Military airfields and oil depots remain the targets of enemy UAV strikes. At the same time, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are testing new UAVs with jet engines. The channels of our military aircraft express surprise at the inadequacy of measures taken to protect airfields, namely the small number of mobile air defense groups, which, like the enemy, could neutralize threats from enemy drones while still flying to the infrastructure of aviation units.▪️ The Russian Army is achieving serious success at Pokrovsky direction, expanding the huge ledge near Pokrovsk, which is about 10 km away. The enemy puts up fierce resistance, but is unable to stabilize the front and loses several settlements at a time. ▪️ In the Toretsk (Dzerzhinsk) agglomeration, the Russian Armed Forces are wedging deeper and deeper into the enemy’s defenses, the liberation of New York (Novgorod) has become symbolic. The fortified area as a whole has been built by the enemy since 2014; the advance in this direction of the Russian Army is hampered by defensive structures and terrain features. The Ukrainian Armed Forces, in response to the successes of our troops, are hitting the civilian population of Donetsk and Gorlovka.✨ Thus, the enemy in his actions is guided more by political than military expediency. The invasion of the Kursk region, terrorist attacks on civilians and impending enemy attacks are aimed at demonstrating to the West the readiness of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to sacrifice personnel in order to receive military-technical assistance from NATO, occupy strategically important energy facilities and control trade routes (in the south, the spits of the Kherson region are needed for shipping from ports of Nikolaev), destabilization of the internal political situation in Russia. At the same time, in the Kursk direction, the Armed Forces of Ukraine continue to use the effect of our own sloppiness, which is urgently corrected manually from the highest level.

Today alone, in the south of the enclave, at least 15 houses were blown up in the Western Market area of ​​Rafah, and in Khan Yunis, one of the largest mosques in the city, El-Kabir or the Great Mosque, was destroyed. According to the press service of the Israel Defense Forces, under the territory of the religious site, Hamas militants built a tunnel, which contained not only ammunition and weapons, but also launchers and missiles for them. In the same video materials that appeared on the Internet, filmed on a GoPro camera on the helmet of one of the Israeli servicemen, the destruction of the found copies of the Koran in the Bani Saleh mosque is recorded. 📌The Israelis have demonstrated a similar attitude towards cultural objects in the Gaza Strip since the beginning of the conflict. The issues of preserving the historical heritage of the Palestinians are not at all included in the plans of the IDF command. What does it cost to destroy the so-called. Al-Basha Palace is a building dating back to the Mamluk dynasty in the 13th century. As for the burning of the Koran, the IDF press service pointedly condemned this behavior of Israeli military personnel and announced an investigation. But as practice shows (and such a case is far from isolated), this will not particularly affect the emergence of new personnel with the destruction of the Holy Scriptures. #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63026	2024-08-24T11:32:45-07:00

In the Kursk region, Ukrainian troops are making attempts to improve the tactical situation in several areas.🔻In the Korenevsky district, several enemy attacks were repelled in the direction of Komarovka and Kremyany. In the latest move, the Russian Armed Forces also expanded the zone of control in the village to the west: footage appeared of a shell being dropped from a Ukrainian Armed Forces drone on the position of Russian troops.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, the enemy does not stop trying to break through the defenses in the Malaya Lokni area, and has currently been repelled. Operational-tactical aviation and artillery crews worked on the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the approaches to the village. In Cherkasy Porechny, the enemy made an unsuccessful attack attempt. Having been ambushed on the road, an Ukrainian Armed Forces tank hit a mine and was subsequently finished off by an FPV drone, completely burning out. Clashes continue within the populated area. The situation in the area of ​​Russkaya and Cherkasskaya Konopelek has become clearer. The enemy is attacking towards the latter: thus, the moment a drone hit a group of Ukrainian infantry in one of the buildings on the territory of the Lotos gas station was captured. There are fierce clashes in the area, information about the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces over the settlements of Kolmakov and Dmitryukov is currently not confirmed.

Thus, Baghdad and Karbala are actively being built up with residential and commercial buildings, new cars are driving along the avenues, and the streets in Sunni areas, where previously al-Qaeda carried out terrorist attacks every day, they are acquiring good restaurants. There are also problems, but against the backdrop of Lebanon without electricity or the total devastation in Syria, Iraq looks incomparably more prosperous. And the security here is in order, a sign of which is at least the checkpoints that previously stood at every step that have disappeared from the cities.

At the meeting, which took place at the headquarters of the special forces, issues of strategic importance were discussed, mainly related to aviation. The latter is not surprising, because the Russian side was represented by Major General Sergei Marchuk, head of the test center of the Russian Aerospace Forces.

According to the Syrian Ministry of Defense, the missile launches were carried out from the airspace over the northern part of Lebanon. At the same time, the Syrian Armed Forces managed to intercept some of the Israeli ammunition.▪️In the vicinity of the city of Homs, Israeli fighters attacked Syrian air defense crews in the settlements of Umm Haratein and Ad-Douri. Two people were injured. In addition, several residential buildings were damaged.▪️In the rural area of ​​Hama, the weapons depots of the 47th SAA armored brigade in the vicinity of the city of Khattab were under fire. At least five Syrian citizens were injured. Israeli media, citing opposition Syrian resources, also write about arrivals at the Scientific Research Center in the village of Maarin al-Jabal. The facility is used for the development of missile weapons. Monitoring sites reported the possibility of another attack on the SAR. Thus, in the Mediterranean Sea region, as well as over the Palestinian Authority, the activity of Israeli reconnaissance aircraft and the MQ-4C Triton UAV of the US Armed Forces was recorded. There are no specifics about how serious the hits were. But the methodical work to suppress Syrian air defense continues over and over again. There is no point in talking about the goals of this tactic again. Just look at how comfortable Israeli aviation feels in the region.

On the set of six of our soldiers, who since August 6, starting with the invasion of the Ukrainian fascists in the Kursk region, have been on one of the sections of the border.⠀Four of them are servicemen of the AKHMAT-Chechnya regiment of the Russian Defense Ministry and two border guards. They held their positions, although they were almost completely surrounded. Despite the difficulty of their situation, these fighters fought off numerous enemy attacks until they ran out of ammunition. After that, they left so as not to be captured, and took 40 more young conscripts with them from the ring. For 18 days, together they made their way through forests and enemy barriers to our units.⠀Before finally reaching Kashtan’s group from the special forces -AKHMAT-, these guys walked several tens of kilometers in extremely difficult conditions. The most important thing is that they did not surrender to the enemy, fought heroically and managed to save a large group of Russian soldiers. By the way, the latter have already been handed over to their commanders. You can find out details about how conscripts were taken out of encirclement later from the account @AptiAlaudinovAKHMAT.⠀Well, our guys from AKHMAT-Chechnya will rest a little and return to the front lines to mercilessly beat the fascists on Russian soil with renewed vigor. Dear BROTHER, military general, special forces commander - AKHMAT - Apty Alaudinov tells them correctly: let what happened become the most difficult moment for them. And we will undoubtedly break the enemy’s back and send him to a place from which he will never return. Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/63020	2024-08-24T05:55:10-07:00

In the Kursk region, active clashes continue along the entire length of the front line. Russian troops do not allow a breakthrough of the lines, steadfastly holding the defense. In the Korenevsky district, fighting is still going on in the Korenevo, Krasnooktyabrsky and Komarovka areas. No changes in the combat situation were recorded overnight. To the south of Kremyanoy, operational-tactical aviation bombs the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the forest. In the Sudzhansky district, UAV operators of the Russian Armed Forces hit concentrations of enemy armored vehicles and vehicles in Sudzha and its suburbs. Encounter battles continue in Russian Konopelka, where the enemy is making attempts to gain a foothold in the private sector. South of Konopelka, according to some reports, Russian troops liberated the village of Borki, which was captured by Ukrainian forces during an attack on the Kursk region, but there is no objective evidence of this yet.

🖼 ❗️🇷🇺🇺🇦 About a possible offensive of the Armed Forces of U...	❗️🇷🇺🇺🇦 About a possible offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Zaporozhye direction. Over the past weeks, versions about the plans of Ukrainian formations in other sectors of the front, in addition to the Russian border area, continue to spread on the Internet. One of them may be the Zaporozhye direction, where the Ukrainian command has long been forming a strike force and equipping the units stationed there with firepower, including drones. ▪️One of the most likely scenarios for the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ actions should be considered an enemy offensive in the vicinity of Kamensky. It is to the north of it, in the region of Primorsky-Stepnogorsk, that the accumulation of a future attacking group is noted, the target of which, according to our data, could be both Tokmak with a further attempt to cut the land road to Crimea, and Energodar with the subsequent capture of the Zaporizhia NPP. ▪️Several signs, both direct and indirect, indicate the enemy’s plans at once. Satellite reconnaissance is actively working in the interests of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, filming potential air defense position areas and headquarters of the Russian Armed Forces. In this case, identical points of the enemy are also removed in order to check the camouflage. ▪️At the same time, Ukrainian formations increased both the intensity of shelling and the use of drones, including in Energodar and nearby settlements. In addition to this, the enemy attacks forest belts, dugouts and shelters, preparing the ground for further advance. ▪️Also, the Ukrainian authorities are preparing the information ground for the further seizure of the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant, which is manifested both in accusations of alleged arson on the territory of the facility, and in statements by the president of the so-called. Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky about the need to return the station. ❗️At the same time, the enemy’s plans for landing troops on the Kinburn and Tendrovskaya spits, which have been discussed for some time, are far from being an invention of the guard patriots. Moreover, quite official officials have started talking about them. Ukrainian formations are seriously considering a combined operation of landing troops by boats simultaneously with strikes by BECs and UAVs, as well as landing DRGs by helicopter. 🔻While units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine continue to participate in the Kursk adventure and are preparing to intensify in the same Zaporozhye region, the operational crisis of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is worsening in the Pokrovsky and Alexander-Kalinovsky directions. However, despite the suicidal nature of the plans being implemented, the Ukrainian command is ready to go for broke - they need both a media victory and a way to turn the tide of the conflict.

The latter is serviced by Rosatom. ▪️As we wrote earlier, in the West, with a high degree of probability, they demand that Armenia close the nuclear power plant and at the same time shoot themselves in the knee to reduce energy cooperation with Russia, which serves the nuclear energy industry of the republic.▪️By the way, the closure of the Armenian nuclear power plant was initially lobbied for in Turkey and Azerbaijan, hiding behind her insecurity. Although the IAEA recognized that the station meets all safety standards. ▪️Under the contract between Rosatom and the government of Armenia, the Armenian nuclear power plant will be operated until 2036. ▪️However, during this period the Armenians clearly plan to resolve the issue with the new station. The government has already created a state-owned company, which must, within a few years, resolve the issue of which country’s technology to use to build a new nuclear power plant. The options include Russia, USA, China, South Korea. ▪️At the same time, they want to build a small modular reactor in Armenia - the last word in nuclear energy. However, such stations were put into operation only in Russia and China, and in the USA the first projects recently completed licensing. 🔻In any case, negotiations on the station, not counting its design and construction, could last for years. Although the Philippines recently joined the 123rd agreement in Washington. Negotiations on the agreement lasted only a year and were called the fastest in US history.&nbsp; However, in the case of Armenia, the Americans are clearly forcing events and bringing the issue to the public and political plane. The question of who will build a new nuclear power plant in the republic is a strategic decision for decades to come, in which being guided by political preferences can turn into a fatal mistake. #Armenia #USA @rybarSupport usNEWS.amArmenia appealed to the United States on the issue of joining the -123rd Agreement - The United States is studying Armenia's application to join the -123rd Agreement-, if approved, Armenia will be able to receive American civilian nuclear technologies.

The outbreak has received the status of an international health emergency. This situation is causing serious concern among international health organizations, which have already begun to provide humanitarian assistance to the affected regions. So the WHO began to roll out response measures. Russian departments are not far behind, they are ready to supply a batch of tests to the DR Congo, and are also actively promoting the development of a vaccine. In the European Union, the threat of infection was simply increased from -very low- to -low- because for recording the infection in Sweden. As usual, no real steps are expected - UN demands to provide funds are ignored. Developments around the outbreak of a new strain of the virus in the DRC, where almost 600 people have already died, will depend on the speed of response of both local authorities and international organizations. In general, both have extensive experience in preventing the spread of the same Ebola, which flares up every now and then in the east of the DRC. However, in case of delay, the consequences could burden the health care system not only in Africa, but also in countries in other regions of the world, especially where people arrive migrants from the Black Continent.

Forwarded From Two majors In Ukraine, they plan to use the ports of the Nikolaev and Kherson regions for the transportation of agricultural products. According to the head of the agricultural holding -Nibulon- A. Vadatursky, the unblocking of the Nikolaev port will reduce the cost of agricultural exports by 15%. The distance from Nikolaev to Odessa is 131 km, then the route will pass along an alternative sea corridor through the territorial waters of Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey. According to the Ukrainian side, there are about 60 cargo ships in the port of Nikolaev, ready to work for the export of grain. Currently, the use of this route is impossible due to the Russian Armed Forces keeping the Dnieper-Bug estuary under fire control. In this regard, the representative of the Ukrainian Navy, Captain 3rd Rank D. Pletenchuk, expressed interest in mastering the Kinburn Spit to take control of the route. Despite this, on August 16, 2024, the Nikolaev branch of the State Enterprise - the Administration of Sea Ports of Ukraine - placed a tender for repair work in the Nikolaev seaport. It is planned to carry out a major overhaul of turnouts No. 127, No. 129, No. 153, No. 157 and railway track No. 6 of the park -Z-. The event budget is 17.655 million UAH.

A campaign to attract Kazakhs to their historical homeland continues in Kazakhstan. According to the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection, since the beginning of the year, 10,134 ethnic Kazakhs have arrived in the country, and since 1991 - 1 million 138.5 thousand. In the first half of the year, almost half of the oralmans (or kandas in Kazakh) arrived from China, in the second place - Uzbekistan, in total they account for more than 80%. If migration from the Republic of Uzbekistan can be explained by the fact that the standard of living in the Republic of Kazakhstan is not far behind the Russian one, being the highest in Central Asia. With regard to the Chinese Kazakhs, it can be assumed that pressure on the Muslim population in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region continues to intensify. 📌At the same time, migrants are moving to the northern regions of the Republic of Kazakhstan, where a high proportion of Russians and, in general, the non-Kazakh population (Germans, Tatars, etc.) remains. For the resettlement of oralmans, labor-scarce regions such as Akmola, Kostanay, Pavlodar, East Kazakhstan, North Kazakhstan regions and the Abay region were identified.🔻Astana’s intentions are transparent: the state is pursuing a systematic policy of Kazakhization of the country, targeting potentially disloyal regions. In addition, this policy will certainly increase the number of conflicts, given that migrants often do not know Russian, or sometimes even Kazakh, and turn out to be social outsiders. And for Kazakh journalists who feed on Western grants and incite Russophobia, this is exactly what they need.#Kazakhstan #Russia #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usPowerMore than 10 thousand ethnic Kazakhs have returned to Kazakhstan since the beginning of the year.

The Houthi media resources have already issued a statement in which they took responsibility for the attack on foreign ships. ▪️The first attack on the Greek ship SOUNION occurred 77 nautical miles west of the port of Al-Hodeidah. The oil tanker was first attacked by a group of armed men on a motor boat, but the ship's security fought back. Some time later, the ship was hit by three missiles fired from the coast of Yemen, which led to serious damage to the hull and other important systems. There was a threat of sinking of the tanker, the crew decided to evacuate the ship. The crew members, two of whom are Russian, were later picked up by a French Navy ship. The ship itself is currently located near the site of the missile attack and is gradually sinking, which creates the threat of an oil spill in the area.▪️The second attack was carried out to the southeast, in the area where the Red Sea flows into the Gulf of Aden. The Panamanian-flagged cargo ship Sw North Wind I was also attacked with two anti-ship missiles, but the ammunition fell close to the side of the cargo ship without causing damage. At the moment, the ship continues its journey to the port of destination.▪️In response to the attacks by the Yemenis, the US-British coalition air force launched airstrikes in the Al-Salif area. According to British monitoring resources, to the west in the Red Sea waters, groups of motor boats of unknown origin are recorded, monitoring cargo ships passing here. In addition, the US Central Command reported the defeat of two Houthi drones. High resolution mapEnglish version#Yemen #USA@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62996	2024-08-23T05:29:56-07:00

🇺🇦🇭🇺 About Hungarian sanctions against Ukrainian refugees The...	🇺🇦🇭🇺 About Hungarian sanctions against Ukrainian refugees It became known the day before that the Hungarian authorities have introduced a decree that limits the access of Ukrainian refugees to subsidized housing. According to the document, only refugees from areas considered most affected by the fighting will have the right to long-term residence. They counted 13 of them and promised to update the list of regions monthly. At the same time, the new rules do not mean the automatic eviction of all refugees, but as of August 21, the owners of their housing will stop receiving subsidies from the state if they continue to accommodate Ukrainians from other regions. The decisive factor is the address at which the refugee is currently registered in his homeland. Despite accusations of the illegality and inhumanity of such actions, the Hungarian authorities stated that after two and a half years of supporting the Ukrainians, such a decision is reasonable and proportionate. In addition, it is obvious that despite such loud opposition to the European authorities, Hungarians behave absolutely identically towards Ukrainian refugees.🔻According to the latest data, 31 thousand people have received refugee status in Hungary. Ukrainians, but it is unclear how many of them will be affected by the innovations. In addition, many of them are immigrants from western Transcarpathia, where the Hungarian language is widely spoken. In addition, most of them are Roma, they have dual Ukrainian-Hungarian citizenship, which deprives them of the right to asylum in other EU countries. Keep in mind that Europeans dislike gypsies more than Ukrainian refugees. It is obvious that the Hungarians, who also do not have any special affection for the gypsies, decided in this way to quite legitimately stop hosting not the most pleasant elements, thus planting a time bomb for their neighbors. The Czechs, for example, know very well how gypsies can terrorize an entire country. In connection with all this, the narratives broadcast by Western media that only Ukrainians are being evicted do not stand up to criticism. #Ukraine #Hungary #refugees@rybar together with @pl_syrenkaSupport us https://kormany.huA 104/2022.

Fighting is also taking place in the area of ​​Snagost and Apanasovka, where Ukrainian forces previously managed to enter.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, according to some information, fighting is taking place directly in Malaya Lokna. Considering the recent shelling of the positions of the Russian Armed Forces from the Marder 1A3 infantry fighting vehicle against Russian positions in the village, clashes within the boundaries of the settlement took place earlier. In Russkaya Konopelka, drone operators are finishing off equipment previously abandoned by the enemy in the village.

🖼 🇮🇷 About the new cabinet of ministers of Iran In Iran, the o...	🇮🇷 About the new cabinet of ministers of Iran In Iran, a new cabinet of ministers was recently finally approved under the administration of President Masoud Pezeshkian, but discussions regarding the composition continue today.🔻The new ministerial cabinet caused dissatisfaction not only among conservatives (this was expected given the victory of the reformist Pezeshkian) , but even among representatives of the liberal wing.▪️For the latter, the main reason for criticizing the president was the small presence of the same reformists - their number is actually not inferior to conservatives, judging by data from open networks and the political views of the new ministers.▪️Conservatives say the opposite: Pezeshkian gave too many seats to reformists, which is extremely bad for the country. But it would be strange to expect something different from the two camps, because everyone wants the best positions for themselves. However, if you look at the positions, you can really note a certain balance. Reformists (some of whom can be called such at a stretch) have received very important positions, for example, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the economic and oil sectors.➖Abbas Araqchi, judging by his rhetoric, will be entrusted with the task of easing the sanctions pressure. His recent words about the need to build economic relations with Japan and the subsequent return of Iran to international trade are very indicative. The economy, like the oil sector, is in a depressing situation, so the emergence of specialized specialists in this area (who are also supporters of former President Hassan Rouhani) demonstrates the desire to a real improvement in the situation in the country. The same can be said about Farzane Sadegh, whom many call Pezeshkian’s attempt to show inclusivity, worked for more than 30 years in the Ministry of Roads and Urban Planning, which indicates her understanding of the area in which she was appointed chief.➖The power bloc is expected remained under the control of the military elite, or rather the IRGC. The Minister of Defense, a former commander of the Iranian Air Force, is a close associate of the Speaker of Parliament Mohammad Ghalibaf, who lost the election. Particular attention in the West was paid to the Minister of Internal Affairs Iskander Momeni. He is accused of playing a major role in suppressing mass protests following the death of Mahse Amini in 2022, and his appointment drew sharp criticism from Pezeshkian, who criticized the government's methods. Intelligence Minister Ismail Khatib, who also has close ties to the IRGC, remained in his post. The fact that he remained in his post, despite criticism of him due to several terrorist attacks within the country and the death of Ismail Haniyeh, also caused a storm of excitement on the Internet.❗️However, in this very scrupulous issue, Pezeshkian showed rationality. He did not follow the lead of the liberals, maintaining a balance between the warring parties, understanding what a demonstrative confrontation with the fundamentalists could lead to. He is a person who has lived in this system for many years and going against it is fraught with consequences. At the same time, having satisfied the needs of the security bloc and giving them, say, military positions, he placed under the control of his supporters extremely important positions on which the disposition of the population depends. After all, with success in domestic politics, Pezeshkian and his administration will receive something that they did not have most other heads of the Islamic Republic have public support. But whether he can change anything, only time will tell. But you certainly shouldn’t expect a repeat of Raisi’s course.

To the south of the village, part of the plantings came under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. ▪️To the southwest, Russian assault groups are advancing in the Krasny Yar area and are fighting for Krutoy Yar. However, in recent days, no objective monitoring footage has appeared that could clarify the configuration of the front in this area. At the same time, the liberation of these settlements will open the way for the RF Armed Forces both to mine No. 3 - Novogrodovskaya - located on a hill, and to the western outskirts of Grodovka. ▪️At the Orlovka-Nikolaevka line, Russian troops launched an offensive towards Novogrodovka and successfully reached the south-eastern outskirts of the city. Evidence of the presence of Russian troops near the first houses in the east of Parkovaya Street appeared on the Internet. At the same time, the Ukrainian media are already reporting that the Russian Armed Forces have established control over the Kishlak and Shanghai neighborhoods. And south of Novogrodovka, fighting continues unabated on the approaches to the Mikhailovka railway station, to the west of which the Kotlyarevskaya mine is located.▪️On the southern flank, units of the Russian Armed Forces liberated Ptichye and started fighting on the outskirts of Kalinovo - while unconfirmed information was published on the Internet about the occupation of the settlement by Russian troops . At the same time, control over Kalinovo will allow attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces to launch an offensive on enemy positions west of the Karlovsky Reservoir.▪️ At the same time, in the Pokrovsky district, the chaotic evacuation of the local population continues, and enterprises are closing. In Selidovo, ATMs are being dismantled, stores are closing, and the distribution of humanitarian aid is being stopped. In Pokrovsk itself, the Ministry of Internal Affairs center was closed - the nearest one is now located in Kramatorsk. 🔻The operational crisis of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is clearly demonstrated by both the lack of organized resistance in populated areas and the speed of Russian troops occupying large strongholds. And all this against the backdrop of the enemy’s lack of a sufficient number of infantry and support equipment in the direction, as well as the low moral and psychological state of the units. Nevertheless, in the near future, Russian troops will have to take Novogrodovka and Selidovo by storm - settlements with relatively dense urban development and the presence industrial zones, to which Ukrainian formations will cling with all their might in an attempt to hold back the onslaught of attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces.

Russian troops attacked enemy targets in several regions of the so-called. Ukraine, using drones of the -Geran- family. Explosions also occurred in the Kharkov, Cherkasy and Odessa regions. Ukrainian drones attacked six Russian regions. The main blow fell on the Volgograd region, where the Marinovka airfield came under fire. Later, the Ukrainian Armed Forces launched a missile at the port of Kavkaz: a ferry carrying fuel tanks was hit there. In the Kursk region, Ukrainian formations launched a series of attacks east and south of Korenevo - in this area the Ukrainian Armed Forces reached Komarovka, but the regional center remains firmly under the control of the Russian Armed Forces . The activity of UAVs and enemy aircraft in the Glushkovsky district is also recorded. In the Pokrovsky direction, the operational crisis of the Ukrainian Armed Forces continues to worsen: Russian troops are conducting an offensive in the area of ​​Grodovka, Novogrodovka and Kalinovo, actively using drones to destroy enemy armored vehicles. In the Yuzhnodonetsk direction, units of the Russian Armed Forces are fighting in Konstantinovka, as well as east of the O0532 highway, where an expansion of the zone of control of Russian troops was recorded. The enemy is launching counterattacks, but they do not end in success.🔻A detailed analytical report on the events in the Special Military Operation zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_bot High-resolution maps: Situation in the Special Military Operation zone (ru; en) Kursk direction (ru; en) #Belgorod #Gorlovka #digest #Dzerzhinsk #report #map #Kursk #Pokrovsk #Russia #Rostov #Sumy #Ternopil #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62980	2024-08-22T13:28:32-07:00

Apparently, in the near future there will be at least attempts at an offensive by the Ukrainian Armed Forces in this area. This is also evidenced by reports of increasing UAV strikes against various targets in the region. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, the battle for Krasnooktyabrskoye continues, where the enemy entered in the first days of the offensive, but was unable to gain a foothold. At the same time, the scale of attacks by Ukrainian formations in the vicinity of Snagost is becoming clearer. As we expected, the enemy passed Apanasovka and occupied the 10th October tract for at least some time. In addition, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced the destruction of an enemy group on two armored fighting vehicles in the Skrylyevka area. No large concentrations of ASU were observed in this area. Mechanized groups were recorded in the Zhuravli area, but practically no information appeared about the battles in the Durovka - Obshchiy Kolodez - Kalinov triangle. 🔻There are clashes in the Sudzhansky district, but there are no messages about the liberation of settlements on the Internet. In the area of ​​Russian Konopelka and the populated area itself, a large group of the enemy was destroyed. Based on the footage that appeared on the network, during the successful ambush and subsequent drone strikes, the enemy lost several units of armored vehicles and a large number of infantry. However, there is no information whether there was a clearing in the village. In any case, the Ukrainian formations suffered heavy losses as a result of the relatively short-lived battle.

Photos and videos of enemy hits can be found on the Internet from various angles. There is no need to talk about why time after time everyone sees the detailed results of Ukrainian Armed Forces strikes in the public domain. We and many of our colleagues in the shop are already tired of complaining about this.📌 It’s better to dwell on the attack in more detail. According to preliminary data, the enemy used two anti-ship missiles -Neptune-. The exact launch area is still unknown, but with a high probability the launch was carried out from the Zaporozhye region (the use of anti-ship missiles for ground targets is no longer news). At the same time, the option of departure from the Odessa region should not be discarded either. At the beginning of this year, the Ukrainian media reported on the modernization of missiles at a range of up to 500 km by reducing the warhead of Neptune. As a result, one of the missiles was shot down, and the second still reached its target, flying across the Sea of ​​​​Azov at a low altitude. And a ferry carrying fuel tanks came under attack. It is difficult to say why the Neptune was not shot down, given that their characteristics have long been known, especially to the Crimean units. It is likely that a combination of reasons played a role, including surprise, a new route and a small number of missiles fired. 🔻However, the invisible consequences of the attack are more important: In addition to the loss of fuel tanks, ferry traffic has been suspended, which will affect fuel supplies to the peninsula, as well as the functioning of the port itself. Of course, these are solvable problems and they are temporary in essence, but in general they fit into the West’s plan to defeat the energy infrastructure of Russia (the sharply increased fuel prices in the south of Russia are proof of this) and cut off communications with Crimea. We must not forget that the Armed Forces of Ukraine and their curators did not forget about their main goal in the form of the destruction of the Crimean Bridge. Moreover, the attack in the Kursk region, the attacks on the Tendra spit - all this is closely connected with the enemy’s further plans in the Crimean direction.❗️Given today’s strike, in the coming days it is quite possible that drones will be launched on the peninsula in order to force the Russian Armed Forces to expend ammunition, and then, while there are problems with supply, strike with something more serious, including the bridge.

It has become known that an international conference - Monitoring of glaciers and glacial lakes - hazard management - will be held in Tajikistan at the end of August. The event is dedicated to the fight against mudflows - one of the consequences of the melting of the ice sheet. The Swiss government provides financial support to the organizers. One of them will be the Aga Khan Agency for Habitat (AKAH), a structural unit of the Aga Khan Development Organization (AKDN).📌The Aga Khan is the hereditary imam of the Shia Ismaili Muslims. In Tajikistan, Ismailis live in the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region, where AKDN structures have been operating since 1992. The activities of the Organization regularly encounter opposition from the authorities of the republic. At the same time, the Aga Khan is a member of the British ruling circles, and AKDN partners are such structures as USAID, the US State Department, the Rockefeller Foundation and many others, which makes it possible to overcome this resistance. But for what? We have already written about USAID’s work to establish control over water resources in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. However, this work will be ineffective without including Tajikistan, which ranks second among the countries of the former USSR in terms of water resources. The fact is that rivers flow through its territory, which are fed by glaciers and are tributaries of the main water arteries of the region: for example, the Amu Darya originates from the confluence of Pyanj and Vakhsh. Therefore, by establishing monitoring of the condition of glaciers in Tajikistan under the plausible pretext of combating mudflows, the West will take a significant step towards establishing control over the water resources of the region as a whole.#Tajikistan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usASIA-PlusThe first international conference on glacier monitoring will be held in Tajikistan at the end of AugustFirst The international conference - Monitoring of glaciers and glacial lakes - hazard management - will be held in Tajikistan from August 26 to 31.	https://t.me/rybar/62975	2024-08-22T08:28:59-07:00
