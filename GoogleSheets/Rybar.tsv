However, we would like to look at the problem from a slightly different angle. Yes, the influence of Ankara - and, accordingly, London - in the region (primarily at the expense of Azerbaijan) is really growing. Ties with the Abkhaz diaspora and the business interests of the Turks in Abkhazia have also not been canceled. ▪️At the same time, the scandalous oppositionist Adgur Ardzinba, supported by Turkey, is playing multi-vector, but not because he dreams of turning Abkhazia into an Ottoman outpost - the selfish interests of him and his team have been analyzed in some detail in numerous publications. Political blackmail of Moscow through Ankara (or another third party) is a standard tactic popular among many local elites in the former USSR. ▪️Of course, the Turks invest in the region for a reason. Their economic presence in Abkhazia is coal, trade, diaspora, influence. But to say that the republic is already on the verge of becoming -Northern Cyprus- means to greatly exaggerate the real capabilities of Turkey. 🔻A much more interesting question is: how effective is Russian policy in the region, if talk about Turkish intervention becomes an element of the internal political struggle in Abkhazia? How much will the situation change after the elections, which are receiving so much attention in Moscow? And will it be possible to limit the influence of pro-Turkish lobbyists in Russia itself after this and other stories of Turkish interference in the zone of Russian national interests? #Abkhazia #elections #Russia #Turkey@rybarSupport usTelegramDTM🗡🇹🇷 What will happen if Turkey wins the presidential elections in Abkhazia?

At the instigation of Trump, the thesis that the so-called Ukraine will pay for American aid with reserves of rare earth metals. Apparently, in this context, we will have to repeat what has been said many times: ▪️Even according to official Ukrainian statistics, a significant part of natural resources is concentrated in areas that the Kiev regime does not control. He won’t be able to sell anything from there.▪️On the so-called. Ukraine does not have any huge deposits of rare earth metals relative to the world. And you can just ask the question: if there were so many of them, then why didn’t anyone need them before? ▪️Even existing reserves may be uninteresting to investors due to their difficulty in extracting and other factors, when production costs will exceed the potential profit from the sale. Why then does Trump make such statements? Everything again comes down to the style of work - to announce loud initiatives as part of the fulfillment of election promises, in order to then quietly roll them back.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 In the same way, during his first term, Trump -withdrew troops from Syria, -built a tunnel- between the Palestinian territories and -replaced the American contingent in Afghanistan with PMC.➖➖➖➖➖➖As we have written many times, what is interesting is not the numerous loud plans of the current American administration, but how far it will go in implementing them. It will be possible to judge soon.#USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67750	2025-02-05T05:32:20-08:00

Forwarded From Two majors🛩On the prospects of countering the fall of -debris- on Russian objectsAgainst the backdrop of increasing (almost daily) fires at military-industrial complex and fuel and energy complex enterprises in connection with -falling debris- we drew attention to the activities of our enemies in this direction. In the USA🇺🇸 The Congressional Research Service (CRS, serves as a research institute under Congress) published a report on efforts to counter UAVs. Based on the experience of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, it was concluded that it is necessary to increase the supply of new maneuverable short-range air defense (M-SHROAD) systems to the troops. This is planned to be achieved by saturating US Armed Forces units with M-SHORAD based on the M1126 Stryker infantry fighting vehicle. The first version of this system (Increment 1) is equipped with AGM-114L Longbow Hellfire missiles, four FIM-92 Stinger missiles, a 30 mm automatic cannon and a 7.62 mm M-240 machine gun, as well as a Ku720 radar. The option of replacing the Hellfire with a Stinger missile launcher is being considered, as a result of which their number will increase to 8. In total, the US Army intends to purchase up to 162 M-SHORAD systems, and depending on future decisions, it is planned to expand the fleet to 361 systems. The second version will be equipped with laser weapons. Since February 2024, the United States has been testing four prototypes of 50 kW DE M-SHORAD laser systems in the Middle East. During the tests, good effectiveness against UAVs was noted, work is underway to improve the characteristics against missiles and artillery shells. A decision on the future High Energy Laser (HEL) system is expected to be made by 2026. The third version (planned for production from 2027) will be equipped with the Next Generation Short Range Interceptor (NGSRI) missile, which will replace the FIM-92 Stinger, as well as the XM 1223 Multi-Mode Cluster Munition (MMPA). The fourth modification is designed to cover ground units and is capable of airborne landings. Previously, we reported on the work of the German Rheinmetall🇩🇪 on the creation of a new Skyranger air defense system based on the Leopard 1 tank chassis, equipped with a 30-mm automatic cannon and short-range anti-drone missiles. Even worthless Estonia🇪🇪 is developing a cheap mini-missile to counter drones at an altitude of up to 2 km.✨Russia may be doing a lot of R&D to create similar systems, but we, unlike our opponents, have no time to spare for a long time. But there are simple solutions (mobile fire groups, a unified awareness system between all air defense areas, twin weapons and other Kulibin developments) that do not require large investments of money, but only the desires of officials and the simplification of a number of bureaucratic norms. In the meantime, the wreckage will continue to plague our defense industry, energy sector and civilian life every day. Two majors	https://t.me/rybar/67748	2025-02-05T05:02:14-08:00

On Tuesday, February 4, the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) issued a statement in which it refused to observe elections in Tajikistan. ODIHR had already refused to observe elections in Russia and Belarus under the pretext of late issuance of an invitation or limiting the number of observers from the host state. However, this time in Tajikistan they have already begun to deploy their mission. On January 22, a team of ODIHR experts settled in Dushanbe. This time, the pretext for the refusal was the accreditation procedure: according to the ODIHR, the Tajik authorities should have immediately accredited their observers.📌By coincidence, the refusal to monitor coincided with the suspension of funding for projects abroad and USAID activities (many NGOs in Tajikistan suffered from this).🔻The ODIHR planned to send 20 people for a month and 150 observers about a week before elections, which will take place on March 2. They all had to pay for work, food, accommodation, fees and other expenses. And the suspension of the flow of American money had a critical impact on the organization of the observers’ activities, and the European bureaucracy was unable to promptly allocate funds. ➖➖➖➖➖➖In this funny way, by blaming Tajikistan, the OSCE is covering up its failures.#elections #EU #CentralAsia #Tajikistan@rybar Support usOSCELack of accreditation by Tajikistan less than a month before elections makes continuation of OSCE observation mission impossibleWARSAW, 4 February 2025 – The lack of assurance by the authorities of Tajikistan that international observers will be accredited has regrettably made it necessary to cancel the observation of the country’s upcoming parliamentary elections, the OSCE Office…	https://t.me/rybar/67747	2025-02-05T04:28:43-08:00

The Russian-language press was stirred up by the statement of the leader of the French Patriots party, Florian Philippot, that President Macron was allegedly preparing a coup d'etat and might try to remain for a third presidential term. The politician said these words in response to a publication in France Info about the possible (!) appointment of the former head of the National Assembly, Richard Ferrand, to the post of head of the Constitutional Council of France. That is, while we are talking about the speculation of journalists from a far from the largest publication based on the statement of the head of a party that is not represented at all in the legislative branch. Moreover, as our colleagues @actualiteFR note, Philippo makes such statements almost every year - and the French media, by the way, have already stopped reacting to this. The Constitutional Council is a body with very limited powers, and it will not be able to push through an initiative with a third term without the consent of parliament.🔻So for now there is no need to expect a coup in France. However, there is no need to worry that the coming year will be boring either: in the conditions of the current political turbulence, into which Macron himself has driven the country, he will probably make many more interesting statements (and maybe it will even come to action).#France@rybarSupport usFranceinfoEmmanuel Macron souhaite porter Richard Ferrand à la tête du Conseil constitutionnel, un danger démocratique pour des spécialistesPour prendre la suite de Laurent Fabius, le chef de l'État pense à l'ancien président de l'Assemblée nationale dont il est très proche.

Today #Comic 810 No. 3 was released: -Not an inch of land can be given up without a fight. We came up with such a joint project to tell children and adults about the exploits of our soldiers from the 810th brigade. I think such graphic stories are the most convenient and visual format. The history of the 810th Brigade is a chronicle of courage, bravery and military brotherhood, written with blood and sweat. In the center of today's story is Lieutenant Klitsa and his assault company. The action takes place in the Kursk region in August 2024. An assault company of Marines gets in the way of the Ukrainian Armed Forces: their task is not to let the enemy through, allowing the civilian population to evacuate. And not give up an inch of land to the enemy.

Various sources estimate the number of participants in the rally from 100 to 150 thousand people.▪️The Serbian Bar Association joined the strike in support of student protests and will suspend its work for 30 days.

🔁 🇲🇩🇺🇸 About the withdrawal of USAID from Moldova and the pa...	Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇲🇩🇺🇸 About the withdrawal of USAID from Moldova and the panic of local grant-eaters The Moldovan opposition demanded to investigate the activities of the American USAID in the country. Deputy from the Victory bloc Vasily Bolya noted that USAID and the Soros networks hooked Moldova on a financial needle and sponsored the people who are now in power. Former USAID grant-eaters are panicking because funding has stopped since the end of January. Moldova is no exception, where pro-Western journalists and activists are sounding the alarm. ▪️Moldavian journalist Oksana Gredchenko said that -foreign assistance is vital in the media space- to counter Russian influence. This does not prevent Gredchenko from calling his portal Moldova.org, which has not been updated for three years, an independent media outlet. Gredchenko noted that Moldova is heavily dependent on US money: Washington not only poured colossal sums into the media and NGOs, but also into government bodies. ▪️The founder of the human rights NGO Promo-LEX, Ion Manole, also said that his organization, without the help of USAID, will not be able to monitor elections and -track foreign interference-. It turns out to be a pun, but the same pun occurred in the last presidential elections in Moldova in 2024, where Promo-LEX together with the OSCE were the only organizations that monitored the voting process. As a result, the numerous violations committed by Sandu and her team did not become an obstacle to maintaining her power. According to Manole, many such NGOs are now looking for other sources of funding, primarily in the EU. 💰USIAD began to allocate huge funds to Moldova after Maia Sandu came to power in 2020. If in 2020 Moldova received $53 million, then in 2021 - $61 million, 2022 - $120 million, 2023 - $310 million, in 2024 - $150 million. If before the arrival of Sandu, USAID invested mainly in business and individual NGOs, then after - in supporting the state apparatus. In fact, it is thanks to such grants and constant incentives that Sandu’s power stays afloat. ❗️Even in the 2024 elections, the majority of Moldovans inside Moldova voted against her, only the votes of the diaspora saved Sandu’s candidacy. There is no doubt that without foreign assistance the power in the republic would have changed long ago. 🔻Moldavian grant eaters are now afraid of Russia, which, in their opinion, will interfere with Moldova’s European path and the investigation of corruption. But corruption under Sandu did not go away, and most of the Western assistance was ordinary bribes for policies. As a result, Sandu herself recently admitted that justice reform and the creation of the Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office with USAID money had failed. Now Sandu’s team has not only no money left for reforms, but even the remnants of Moldova’s economy have been destroyed for the sake of the anti-Russian ambitions of the West. #Moldova #USA #NGO@pezdicide no chemicals - just factsRIA NovostiIn Moldova they demanded to investigate the activities of USAIDThe opposition bloc in Moldova - Pobeda - intends to soon demand an official investigation from the Information and Security Service (ISS) and the prosecutor's office...

🇬🇧 Why do Labor want to lower the voting age for elections? Gov...	🇬🇧 Why do Labor want to lower the voting age? The UK government is considering lowering the minimum voting age to 16. A bill could be introduced to Parliament during the next legislative session. Labor leader Prime Minister Keir Starmer included the issue in the faction's manifesto. According to the politician, the initiative will restore some kind of -justice-. They say that if they can work and serve in the army, then they can vote. At the same time, you need to understand: even if the bill enters parliament, you shouldn’t count on new changes immediately coming into force, since it will clearly meet resistance from many politicians. However, there is enough time before the next general elections to push it through in the end. In fact, the proposed initiative is nothing more than another attempt to torpedo the elections as part of a program to discredit national governments. It's not hard to imagine what voting might turn into if 16-year-olds who haven't even finished school are allowed to participate. But for Keir Starmer, whose ratings have been shaken, restoring -justice-, as he says, is clearly a secondary goal. You only need to look at the composition of the Labor Party's electorate to understand its true benefit. And its essence is simple - it is among this category of Britons that Labor has the greatest support, so in the coming weeks and months we should expect some pretty high-profile political debates in the UK. #Great Britain @rybar together with @oldGBRSupport usThetimesLabour could introduce votes for 16-year-olds from next yearA minister has said that an Elections Bill could come in the next parliamentary session, which will begin in spring	https://t.me/rybar/67722	2025-02-04T06:01:02-08:00

Throughout January, Russian troops fought fierce battles in Makhnovka, southeast of Sudzha. Units of the Russian Armed Forces entered the settlement itself in the first week of the month, then the Armed Forces of Ukraine were driven out of positions both on the outskirts of the village and on the left bank of the Sudzha River. After this, there were oncoming battles in Makhnovka for a long time, as a result of which the Russian Armed Forces were unable to hold out in the populated area - this was influenced both by the activity of Ukrainian drones and subsequently by worsening weather, which complicated movement. Ultimately, the southern part of the village moved into the gray zone. Towards the end of January, Russian units launched several attacks from Cherkasskaya Konopelka, one of which was caught on enemy footage. This shooting and information received from the field made it possible to clarify the control zone and find out that the Russian Armed Forces had withdrawn from the settlement. 📌With a high probability, the battles for Makhnovka will resume either after the onset of frost and freezing of the soil, or when the ground has completely dried out. In the meantime, a temporary operational pause has occurred in most of the entire Kursk direction.

The new production is aimed at solving the problem of shortage of explosives for the production of artillery ammunition. Previously, in July 2024, the Norwegian-Finnish company Nammo received funding from the Norwegian Defense Materials Agency to create new production lines for 155 mm projectiles, 120 mm shells for tanks, as well as solid fuel engines for missiles such as AMRAAM (missile defense system for NASAMS). After this, by 2028, production volume will reach 200 thousand shells per year.

Erik Prince, head of the Blackwater PMC (now reformatted and renamed many times), began to rant about the possibility of reviving the practice of issuing letters of marque in certain areas of Mexico and Latin America to combat drug cartels. And at the same time, get the right to take a part of their income from illegal schemes. Letters of marque and reprisal are government-issued powers that allow private individuals (privateers) to perform actions that would otherwise be considered piracy, such as attacking enemy ships during war . The privateers are paid a portion of the loot they -bring home-. The last time such a certificate was issued was in 1942, after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Why is this a circus? Yes, because Prince’s guys are already doing everything indicated without any letters of marque. Moreover, they have been doing this for so long that a number of experts compare not mercenaries with criminals, but criminals with mercenaries. The same Los Zetas cartel - during its heyday - was compared to Blackwater and was considered more of a PMC than a cartel. This is about what Prince’s guys could do without announcements right now. Stories about letters of marque may be a hint of a desire to participate in government contracts, working not only for private traders, but also for the US government. @sex_drugs_kahlo - Latin American happiness [no]BreitbartErik Prince: Letters of Marque Would Let Private Entities Target CartelsLetters of Marque would let private organizations operate in the -dead space- in between government bureaucracies, to target the drug cartels.	https://t.me/rybar/67702	2025-02-03T09:38:41-08:00

According to him, Europeans buy almost nothing from Americans, but they buy everything from them. On this occasion, the association is frantically trying to come up with some kind of answer. Today an informal meeting of EU leaders is being held in Brussels, in which NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and Prime Minister of the non-EU UK Keir Starmer are also taking part. They are going to discuss not only strengthening the EU's defense capabilities, but also a trade war with the United States. Most EU leaders criticize this approach of the American administration, but avoid direct criticism of Trump and speak out in favor of maintaining allied relations between the EU and the US. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz noted that if trade tariffs are introduced, the EU may respond in kind. French President Emmanuel Macron said recent statements from Washington indicate the need for Europe to be more united and stronger. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk believes that a trade war with the United States would be one of the cruelest paradoxes and a total misunderstanding. He said the EU must unite and demonstrate its strength and resilience in relations with the States. 📌 Earlier, Trump had already signed a decree introducing duties on goods from Mexico and Canada, which was already a significant blow to European manufacturers who use, for example, Mexico as an inexpensive production site, supplies from which are intended for the US market. And although Trump’s decision helped the dollar rise in the market, the tariffs are generally a blow to global trade and will likely lead to further increases in the prices of goods and services for all consumers and producers. #European Union #U.S. #ekonomika@pl_syrenka - Poland is not a foreign countryTelegram Work, brothers!📺🇺🇸🇪🇺Sky News: Trump said that new duties on the EU will definitely be introduced - We have a deficit of more than $300 billion, they don’t take our cars, they They don’t take our agricultural products, they take almost nothing, but we take everything from them.…	https://t.me/rybar/67700	2025-02-03T08:13:06-08:00

Forwarded From ARCHANGEL OF SPECIAL FORCES🪖Increasing the number of Armed Forces of Ukraine along the border with the Belgorod region While our troops in the Kursk region are liberating the territory from the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the grunts began to become active near the Belgorod region. At the Basovo-Goptovka line, the number of personnel of 15 Separate Infantry Infantry 58 Separate Infantry Brigade increased. Also, more personnel were noted in units 228 about 127 OBr TerO in area of ​​the village of Ternovaya and also the 104th Automatic Brigade on the night of January 28 delivered diesel fuel to the Ukrainian Armed Forces units operating in the vicinity of Kharkov. Thus, the 58th Mechanized Infantry Brigade units were concentrated along this area. Despite the fact that the forces and assets of the 22nd Mechanized Infantry Brigade are stationed there. Taking into account the increasing number of people, as well as fresh supplies of fuel, attempts at incursions or even attacks in the Belgorod region cannot be ruled out. In addition, it is possible that the Armed Forces of Ukraine will move in the direction of the penetration of our units in the Volchansky sector. In general, Zelensky recently set the task for the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to drive out Russian troops from the north of the Kharkov region at any cost, where enemy reserves are currently being actively transferred.

The criminals cursed the victims and received a remote access to their mobile phones, after which money was debited from them. Sometimes the attackers even came to the victims under the guise of couriers and took away their bank cards under various pretexts.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 The nuance is that absolutely all the victims were Russian-speaking people from the post-Soviet space - all communication was conducted in Russian. Previously, similar episodes were already recorded last year.➖➖➖➖➖➖If we remember where exactly the bulk of such call centers are located, we can state: Ukrainian telephone scammers have already reached Israel, actively replenishing their pockets at the expense of local old people. Considering the role of the Kyiv regime in organizing such criminal activities, it could not have happened without its sanction in this case.

If we omit a few details, then for a long time they were complicated by the tightening of the screws by the SBU and the propaganda pumping of Ukrainian society. In such an atmosphere, the work of the underground was significantly hampered. However, now the situation is changing - the disloyal population to the so-called. Ukraine is getting bigger. The main factor here is -busification-: such videos of people being kidnapped by TCC employees appear so often that they have even created a registry from them. ➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 As another illustration, we can recall the recent episodes of attacks on military registration and enlistment offices in Rivne and Pavlograd, as well as the murder of TCC workers in Poltava and Dnepropetrovsk.➖➖➖➖➖➖And when the -nuts- of the SBU are loosened, Ukrainian society will finally go into depression due to unfulfilled high expectations, and victims of busification will return from the front, the number of people willing to carry out actions against the Kyiv regime will grow even more.#Ukraine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/67693	2025-02-03T04:06:54-08:00

Forwarded From Systemic Pesticide💸🇺🇸 Interesting things are happening with one of the main instruments of propaganda and soft power of the United States - the Agency for International Development (USAID). On the day he took office as president, Donald Trump froze USAID aid to foreign countries for 90 days in order to conduct an audit of programs for compliance with -American values- and&nbsp;US foreign policy goals. 🔻Then a natural leapfrog began: they were either talking about softening the decree, or about its complete annulment, and at this time some grant eaters were crying, while others were waging a war on Twitter, finding out whether the media is independent if it receives payments from the state. At the same time, employees of the Department of Government Effectiveness (DOGE) under the leadership of Elon Musk tried to gain access to the agency’s systems, only the officials decided to stop them and were sent to administrative vacation, and the USAID website suddenly became unavailable. Rumor has it that more than 1 thousand USAID employees and contractors have already been fired or are on leave, and DOGE ultimately received absolute access to the agency's systems. Musk, responding to the publication of the resignation of two officials individuals, said that USAID is a criminal organization and it is time for it to die. At the same time, he accused the agency of using tax money from citizens to finance research into biological weapons, including COVID-19, which killed millions of people. It is clear that a holy place is never empty, and USAID will either be replaced by another similar instrument or reformed. Perhaps the goals set for the agency are not being achieved well enough, which means that more effective personnel are needed, capable of maintaining not only concentration, but also loyalty. What’s even more likely is that the Trump administration urgently needs scapegoats on whom it will be very convenient to blame the shortcomings of its last term and exaggerate the failures of its predecessor.#USA #NPO@pezdicide no chemicals - just factsTelegram Systemic pesticide💸🇺🇦🇺🇸 Ukrainian journalists are crying all over the Internet : for almost a week they did not receive salaries from American grants.

Russian troops launched a series of attacks on targets in the so-called territory. Ukraine: an oil depot near Sumy, production facilities in Kharkov, as well as energy infrastructure in Poltava and occupied Zaporozhye came under fire. Ukrainian formations launched drones into the rear regions of Russia - all of them were successfully intercepted. The enemy also launched a strike from the HIMARS MLRS on the building of a boarding school in Sudzha, while alleging the alleged involvement of Russian aviation in the attack. In the Seversky direction, Russian troops launched a series of attacks in the area of ​​Belogorovka and Verkhnekamensky: despite reports of the advance of the Russian Armed Forces, in fact, only the gray zone was expanded in these areas. In the Chasovoyarsk direction, Russian units came close to the South-Eastern and Block No. 9 mines, having previously knocked out Ukrainian formations from positions near the Kuznya pond and the Krinichki tract. Fighting in Clock Yar itself continues. In the Alexander-Kalinovsky direction, Russian troops are gradually knocking out the remnants of the Ukrainian Armed Forces from Dzerzhinsk.

Still, the need for cheap drones will not decrease amid the escalation of military conflicts on the continent.📌After the appearance of the plant, the Turks will be able to save on logistics, and the Moroccans will become the leading exporters of UAVs in Africa.▪️It is worth noting that not only the Turks have moved part of their UAV production to Africa. This is what the Israeli BlueBird (a subsidiary of IAI) did earlier, which created the production of kamikaze drones SpyX. Recently, the Moroccan authorities have become the main military allies of Western powers after the departure of the French and Americans from the Sahel.

Immediately after the strike on the boarding school in Sudzha, Ukrainian propaganda tried to blame the tragedy on the attack by Russian aircraft. However, this time the Western media decided to take a more cautious position than previously in similar situations. In most materials, major publications cite statements from both sides; stipulate that they place the blame on each other; The editors are not able to confirm any version. 📌 And this is quite indicative, for at least two reasons: ▪️The attempt of the Kyiv regime to once again discredit Russia in the eyes of the international community through a new provocation was not crowned with success. ▪️Western media are now focused on the agenda surrounding the actions of the new US administration, where the main topic is Trump's statements about the negotiations. Stories that break from this trend do not find widespread support. ➖➖➖➖➖➖It’s also worth adding that the same Western media did not notice the story of the massacre in Russian Porechny at all, so the theses that the authorities of the so-called. Ukraine is trying to divert attention from its crimes, which are quite controversial. ➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻At the same time, it is worth understanding that informational injections addressed to the so-called authorities. Ukraine, which has happened many times before, does not mean a stop to Western military assistance to Kyiv. Even with critical materials emerging, arms deliveries continue. And this is especially important to take into account, because the blow to Sudzha, apparently, was inflicted precisely by Western weapons. #Kursk #media technologies #Russia #Ukraine @rybar Support us	https://t.me/rybar/67671	2025-02-02T01:33:01-08:00

Forwarded From Two Majors#Review #Summary for the morning of February 2, 2025▪️ Another week has passed amid the clamor of reports about the actions of the outrageous Trump, generating news stories from Canada to Ukraine. Although the cessation of funding for Ukraine’s financing programs through the same enemy USAID is nothing more than a redistribution of cash flows from those sponsored by the US Democratic Party in favor of the current government in the States, interruptions in the supply of money have already led to the closure of a number of public organizations in Ukraine, supposedly of a patriotic nature. which shows the failure of Ukrainian civil society and the artificial nature of feigned Ukrainian patriotism. At the same time, the Trump team openly discredits Zelensky personally in the media, calling him a dictator and pointing out the theft of American money, which again does not indicate the sympathy of the current US government for Russia, but the desire to spend funds more effectively (and, preferably, personally) for the benefit of the United States, under which can understand anything.▪️ The topic of possible negotiations still does not leave the Western media, while the Supreme Commander personally indicated that Zelensky, who usurped power, is not authorized to sign anything. The President of Russia indicated the outwardly extremely unpleasant Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada as the only possible signatory, thereby once again humiliating the Kiev regime. ▪️ Kyiv, despite political games and newspaper articles, continues to methodically knock out our refineries and try to completely disrupt Russian energy supplies to Europe, targeting the same pipeline infrastructure facilities. The enemy skillfully takes advantage of miscalculations in the organization of our air defense. In general, this will allow the United States to sell its gas and oil to the EU countries, albeit at several times higher prices. The fooled residents of Europe are ready to pay. ▪️ News is increasingly coming from the front about the lack of manpower for the Armed Forces of Ukraine to replenish and replenish brigades. The strategic reserve (-brigades of the 150th series-), brought into battle by Syrsky, is gradually running out, although in January it completed the task of slowing down the advance of the Russian Armed Forces. ▪️ Unfortunately, the scandal surrounding the situation at Novoegorovka and the situation in general in the 20th Army of the Russian Armed Forces does not subside. Apparently, a number of systemic problems in the military leadership, which were postponed until later, even against the backdrop of the armed invasion of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kursk region, are making themselves felt. The desire to hush up scandals is quite understandable, the main thing is that they do not lead to the concealment of illegal actions of officials, even at a high level.▪️ However, the Russian Army retains the initiative on the entire front, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are conducting a defensive operation, trying to exhaust our troops in defense. Bloody battles of high intensity are taking place in the Kursk region; the enemy is drawing up reserves every day, introducing them into oncoming battles. In the Kupyansky direction, the settlement was liberated. Dvurechnaya Kharkov region on the right bank of the river. Oskol, our bridgehead is expanding. In Chasov Yar, the Severny microdistrict is occupied. In Toretsk (Dzerzhinsk), a suburb has been liberated - the settlement. Crimean. To the south and southwest of Pokrovsk (Krasnoarmeysk), the Russian Armed Forces continue to advance, achieving tactical successes in heavy battles. West of Kurakhovo, our troops are making their way to Constantinople. After the liberation of Velikaya (Bolshaya) Novoselka, the Far Eastern warriors will regroup, the enemy is guessing about the direction of the further attack. In the Black Sea, a positive example of the destruction of the enemy’s MBEC was the use of our attack UAV, which shows the possibility of no longer risking the lives of helicopter pilots. ▪️ In general, the complete liberation of such significant cities as Chasov Yar and Dzerzhinsk is approaching. At the same time, the same situation in Velikaya (Bolshoye) Novoselki shows that the Russian Armed Forces are still protecting their main reserves, not bringing them into battle, but rolling back the best attack aircraft for replenishment and rest. However, this does not allow you to develop success at lightning speed - on the shoulders of a fleeing enemy -. Heavy fighting is underway.

We draw attention to who made the statement from the Armed Forces of Ukraine - this is Alexey Dmitrashkivsky. We wrote earlier that he went to the Kursk region precisely to organize such bloody information and psychological actions. This scum has been the organizer of the Kyiv lies in the ATO since 2014. He later admitted that at the beginning of the war he was involved in massive lies about the losses and crimes of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the DPR and LPR. The British BBC laundered the reputation of this speaker. Dmitrashkivsky is a professional provocateur with blood. A sick and narcissistic killer with the call sign -the brightest-.

The enemy claims that up to 95 people are trapped under the rubble. 🔻However, as of August, no more than a hundred residents remained in the occupied city, which makes it unlikely that all of them were in one building.▪️The footage of the destroyed building published by the enemy was indeed filmed in the area of ​​the school, but they do not allow a reliable assessment of the scale destruction, nor the number of victims.➖➖➖➖➖➖▪️Most likely, the blow was inflicted by the Ukrainian formations in order to get rid of unwanted persons who had to be kept. And thus they at the same time placed responsibility on Russia. In fact, no overflights of Russian aviation were recorded in the Sudzha area at this time. A week earlier, near this school, an accumulation of Ukrainian equipment and members of Ukrainian formations was discovered, which were used by UAV operators of the Russian Armed Forces. ➖➖➖➖➖➖Thus it becomes quite obvious that the enemy in the city is hiding behind the civilian population, trying to avoid raids. Such actions are a provocation on the part of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and are aimed at further discrediting Russia’s reputation in the eyes of the international community.#Kursk #Russia #Ukraine @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67664	2025-02-01T11:13:19-08:00
🔁 🇷🇺Regarding the recent arrest of the ex-CEO of the bookmaker...	Forwarded From Tasmanian Devil🇷🇺Regarding the recent arrest of the ex-general director of the bookmaker's office -Fonbet- S. Anokhin. Telegram connects the case with the recent detention of Tufan Sadigov, an investor in the Moscow region FC Khimki, where this Anokhin previously worked. Whether this is true or not is not important in this case. Another thing is interesting. Sadigov is an Azerbaijani businessman known from news reports (let's call him that), who started with contracts for snow removal and road repairs in Moscow. If you type -Khimki- and -Azerbaijan- into a search engine, a lot of information will come up, mostly criminal. Here are some high-profile news recently: ▪️Literally recently, Azerbaijani Kh. Aliyev, who made his way into the chair of the Mundep of Khimki, and the head of the Azerbaijani diaspora, demanded that the Russian Minister of Defense listen to the opinion of the head of Azerbaijan regarding the downed plane. By the way, his LLC - Sofia - A - is engaged in the sale of vegetables.▪️A couple of years ago, this deputy’s assistant Agaev Roman Matlab ogly was involved in the case of Azerbaijani Nazis from VBON, who also managed to receive a letter of gratitude for his work from the leadership of the city of Khimki.▪️Azerbaijani the ultimate fighter R. Ismayilov broke the head of a policeman there while on duty. The diaspora actively tried to get rid of the savage, but in the end he received his four years in prison.▪️The Azerbaijani in the Audi was disadvantaged by the fact that he was not allowed to pass on the road to Khimki and severely beat the driver and his companion - he broke his nose. The diaspora tried to resolve the issue so that the savage would not be imprisoned.▪️In Khimki, a gang of Azerbaijani teenagers was operating, beating schoolchildren right at school.▪️In February 2024, a gang of Azerbaijanis was caught there, poisoning people with burnt cigarettes. The gang was protected by a certain Bakhtiyar Hasanov, who calls himself the head of the Azerbaijani diaspora in Moscow. ▪️The deputy head of Khimki is a certain Kristina Madatova. They wrote that she was allegedly the daughter of Artur Madatov, a former employee of the Pension Fund, a native of Azerbaijan, who was sentenced in 2012 to 5 years in prison for the theft of 15 million rubles. It is interesting that the long-term head of the city of Khimki, D. Voloshin, SUDDENLY wrote a statement a couple of days ago of his own free will. Obviously, the Azerbaijani diaspora in the city of Khimki feels at least not bad.	https://t.me/rybar/67663	2025-02-01T10:41:26-08:00

It is interesting that there is practically no information about it in open sources, that is, the Finns have so far decided not to tell the public about it.▪️It involves -elite- by Finnish standards units, such as the high-readiness Jaeger brigade -Lappi- and the special forces regiment -Utti -, as well as the Finnish border forces. In total - about 1000 military personnel, 100 units of equipment, including NH-90 and MD-500 helicopters.▪️The objectives of the exercise are even more interesting: special forces practice covert movement in tundra conditions, searching for enemy DRGs, landing from helicopters, organizing interaction with territorial units defense and resistance units. ▪️All this is carried out at the Inari-Sevettijärvi border near the Murmansk region. At the same time, part of the training will take place on ice on Lake Inarijärvi.➖➖➖➖➖➖The Finns are consistently training in conducting special operations against Russia. The similarity of nature and climate with the Russian northern regions makes such exercises even more indicative in the context of what position Finland occupies in the Alliance's plans. If anyone has forgotten, then in November last year Finnish special forces, and the same regiment -Utti-, were already practicing delivery of the DRG to the Karelian forests. Now the Murmansk region is under attack. Moreover, this time the Finns are involving some kind of resistance and terrorist defense units, working out a version of guerrilla warfare.

At the moment, one death and six injuries are known. Enemy special services, as well as doctors and rescuers, are working on the spot. ❗️It is too early to draw conclusions about the nature of the explosion, as well as the organizers. Nevertheless, we can cautiously assume that this is another case of undermining a TCC facility by the Ukrainian population. Recently, a similar thing happened in Kharkov and Dnepropetrovsk, where the cars of high-ranking members of local service branches were blown up.

As they say, when the rooster pecked, then reconnaissance drones were raised into the air.➖➖➖➖➖➖The matter, as always, is in the notorious bureaucracy, which led to the fact that an entire squadron of Iranian -Mohajers- just stood idle at the airfield in Taganrog.❗️ The fact that drones were finally deployed into the Black Sea is a positive sign, which creates cause for cautious optimism.

The 88-year-old head of the Odessa Regional Association of Jews, a prisoner of the Bershad ghetto in the Vinnitsa region, liberated by Red Army soldiers, when to Shvartsman was seven years old, spoke for a long time before German deputies. He read a rather pompous speech in Ukrainian, in which he compared the SVO with the crimes of the Nazis during the Second World War, and also stated that it was unpleasant for him to give his Jewish surname, while some the brothers did not hesitate to introduce themselves with the Ukrainian surnames of their wives. At the same time, Shvartsman said that he had survived the most cruel pages of human history, but never mentioned those who saved him and gave me the opportunity not to die. Instead, he is engaged in persecuting peoples and discrediting the feat of the Red Army, although Shvartsman’s older brother died at the front, defending Leningrad.

The center's services include training for law enforcement and military officials, as well as research in nuclear forensics, biosafety and chemical analysts.🔻As we see, mountainous and relatively isolated Tajikistan has finally been assigned the role of the main testing site, which official Dushanbe plays diligently.

Forwarded From Two Majors🇺🇸🇺🇸On the work of enemy instruments - soft power - in the zone of Russia's interests In connection with the temporary freeze of the US financing of external projects, the cessation of the work of many liberal pro-Western NGOs, media and projects in the post-Soviet space is recorded, one of the striking examples of which is the Agency United States for International Development (USAID), leading destructive activities in the Ukrainian direction. This organization, implementing its projects, penetrates into all spheres of society and the state, where, for relatively little money, it grows a completely loyal and ideologically indoctrinated population, which subsequently occupies key positions in the media, media, government and law enforcement agencies, promoting narratives and attitudes beneficial to the United States. Along with Ukraine🇺🇦, where the lack of funding led to the closure of rural clubs in the western regions, Moldova🇲🇩 became one of the leaders in absorbing Western grants. According to our calculations, financial assistance to Moldova from 2022 to 2024 through USAID alone amounted to $77 million. For a state with a budget of up to 4 billion dollars, such an amount is significant and makes it possible to bribe the poor population, especially young people. USAID funds were directed to programs for economic prosperity, democratic governance and support for judicial reform, projects to increase resistance to corruption. , health sector reform, energy security activities, -public engagement for peace and prosperity-, defense sector support, humanitarian assistance and crisis response situations, initiatives to -involve youth and civil society-. In December 2024, the Chairman of the Moldovan Parliament Grosu and the Minister of Foreign Affairs Popsoi held a meeting in the United States with the head of USAID Samantha Power, after which the Agency allocated a grant of 150 thousand dollars for the program - Institutional and Structural Reforms in Moldova (MISRA) - which involves the creation software for creating a database of Moldovan politicians with a system of corruption risks. In fact, the project is aimed at creating a base of loyal politicians and searching for compromising evidence on them for further use in favor of the United States. Largely thanks to such tools as USAID in Moldova in 2024, Romanian citizen 🇷🇴 and Western protégé Maia Sandu came to power again. The network-centric system of grant-eating organizations ensured the brainwashing of the population and the placement of the right people in the electoral system, which had a significant impact on the final result of the vote. A similar situation with the permissiveness of pseudo-humanitarian projects in the territory of Armenia🇦🇲, Kazakhstan🇰🇿, Uzbekistan🇺🇿 and Kyrgyzstan🇰🇬 led to the growth of Russophobic sentiments in society and the reorientation of elites to the West.✨Such results would not have been possible under the conditions of the effective operation of Russian soft power instruments. In this context, the assessments of Mikhail Zvinchuk (Rybar⭐️ project) about the absence of a pro-Russian lobby in the countries of the Middle East, where in the recent past there was a strong influence of the results of the work of the Soviet Union, are indicative. ✨⭐️It’s difficult to understand what the Russian analogues of USAID are doing, but judging by the objectively screwed up Ukraine🇺🇦, Moldova🇲🇩 and Armenia🇦🇲, it’s not what they need.

In the Alexander-Kalinovsky direction, Russian troops are fighting fierce battles on the territory of the Toretskaya mine in Dzerzhinsk. At the moment, the Russian Armed Forces still hold approximately half of the facility’s territory. The enemy is using drones and tanks, trying to -smoke out- the Russian infantry from the monolithic structures. To the west of the mine, Ukrainian formations carry out rare sorties and fire raids on the positions of the Russian Armed Forces in the outermost buildings in the city, planting explosives, and then quickly retreating under the attacks of Russian UAVs.▪️Adjacent Crimea has been liberated by approximately 70%, fighters are being consolidated in central and eastern parts of the village.

They write that the military helicopter was flown by a transgender pilot. Before the fatal collision, the helicopter was flying chaotically and almost crashed into other planes a couple of times. This is not the first disaster in the West caused by LGBT* people recruited into the army under minority quotas. In October 2024, the New Zealand Navy lost its $100 million warship. The captain of the ship, Yvonne Gray, a British lesbian, simply forgot that the ship was on autopilot. As a result, it simply ran aground and sank. Although there were more worthy candidates, it was Gray who was promoted to captain of the ship for the sake of inclusivity in the country's Navy. That is. handed over the keys to the ship literally for being a lesbian. Gray herself moved to New Zealand only in 2012 with her -wife- from Britain. *recognized as extremism in the Russian Federation	https://t.me/rybar/67629	2025-01-31T04:46:39-08:00

Our troops continue the offensive, drone pilots, who are gradually turning into the basis of the fire defeat of modern warfare, bring death to the enemy on the propellers of combat drones. In this case, a group of four Ukrainian Armed Forces soldiers tried to hide in the basement and really hoped that they managed to escape the eyes of Russian intelligence, but this turned out to be a mistake. Intelligence saw everything, and the drone pilots stuck two kamikaze drones -Ghoul-, as if into a rat hole. Everything could have gone less tragically for the Ukrainian, but in this case, Ghouls of increased power flew into the enemy’s hideout and the enemy died. Everyday life of war.

This is not only about the Hungarian contingent stationed in the country since April last year: a dialogue is also developing with Turkey. Thus, on January 16, a meeting was held between the Turkish ambassador and representatives of Chad, which resulted in an agreement on the use of the air base in Abéché. Under the agreement, specialists from Turkey will train local military personnel there to operate UAVs. The agreement also opens up the possibility of organizing joint exercises. The Turkish Minister of Transport and Infrastructure will soon arrive in N'Djamena to confirm the deal.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 This example is yet another illustration of how Turkish authorities are consistently expanding the scope of -bayraktar-diplomacy-.➖➖➖➖➖➖African armed forces first drones in Turkey, and then cooperation grows in this field. Now in Mali, elite units are being trained by the Turks, and a Turkish military contingent will be stationed in Chad. The rapid expansion of Turkey's military influence in Africa makes the leadership in Ankara a rival of the Russian authorities in the export of security to Africa. And this is no longer just soft power, but direct military cooperation. Local authorities interacting with the Turks through various international organizations do not perceive them as agents of Western influence. In addition to this, against the backdrop of successful peacekeeping by the UN and other structures, the authority of the Turkish authorities is only strengthening.

Forwarded From Two majors #Summary for the morning of January 31, 2025▪️ At night in the Voronezh region, air defense forces and electronic warfare systems in the region discovered, destroyed and suppressed several more UAVs. In the south of the region, one of the downed drones fell on a car driving along the highway. The driver suffered a leg injury. He has already received help. Also, as a result of the fall of UAV fragments in the same area, a private residential building and a farm on which the windows were broken were damaged. In Voronezh, as a result of the fall of a suppressed drone, the glazing of an industrial enterprise was damaged. The information provided by the governor of the region may indicate, to put it mildly, that the air defense is operating incorrectly, since as a result of the fall of downed enemy aircraft, civilians are injured and civilian objects are damaged. However, the forces and means of air defense and electronic warfare are not under the control of the heads of regions. In the Rostov region, 25 UAVs were destroyed: in Rostov, Taganrog, Shakhty, Novoshakhtinsk, Azov, Chertkovsky, Oktyabrsky rural, Tarasovsky, Krasnosulinsky, Millerovsky and Zernogradsky districts. In the Krasnosulinsky district near the Grachev farm, electrical wires were broken due to the fall of UAV debris on a power line support, reports the acting governor. Yesterday evening, the Russian Ministry of Defense reported that from 19.50 to 22.00, 17 Ukrainian drones were destroyed by air defense systems on duty. Eleven UAVs were shot down over the territory of the Kursk region and two UAVs each over the territories of the Belgorod, Voronezh regions and the Republic of Crimea.▪️ From the area of ​​the settlement.

The Ukrainian Armed Forces continued to shell Kamenka-Dneprovskaya from artillery.▪️ In the Kherson direction there were mutual strikes with artillery and drones. As a result of the shelling of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, there were emergency shutdowns in the Skadovsky, Golopristansky, Aleshkinsky, Kalanchaksky, Chaplynsky, Kakhovsky municipal districts and the Novokakhovsky urban district. In Aleshki, two local residents were injured as a result of enemy terrorist attacks on a residential building.

During the day, the Russians hit infrastructure facilities in the territory controlled by the Kyiv regime, including the port of Izmail in the Odessa region, as well as airfields in the Kharkov, Sumy and Zaporozhye regions. The enemy launched another raid on the Russian regions: five were destroyed in Crimea and the Bryansk region drones and two missiles. In the Seversky direction, Russian fighters entered the territory of Verkhnekamensky, but the outcome of the assault is still unclear. In the Novopavlovsky direction, units of the Russian Armed Forces attacked in the Uspenivka area and were able to make significant progress near Novoandreevka.

🇮🇱🇸🇾🇺🇸 Withdrawal of American troops from Syria and Israeli...	🇮🇱🇸🇾🇺🇸 Withdrawal of American troops from Syria and Israeli concerns In discussing Trump’s policy in the Middle East, one cannot fail to mention another important news that is being circulated by the Israeli media.📌The White House conveyed to the Israeli authorities a message that President Trump is interested in the withdrawal thousands of American soldiers currently in Syria. This is causing a lot of fear and anxiety in Israel. The move is also expected to affect Syria's Kurdish minority, which fears rights abuses from Turkish President Erdogan. In addition, there are concerns about the security of the Jewish state.➖➖➖➖➖➖▪️It is very interesting to look at such theses from the Israeli media. The key here is fears for the security of Israel on the part of Syria. Typically, when the Israelis publish this, they are preparing in advance a pretext for increasing military activity in a certain country. Israel is now building new forward bases in the occupied part of Quneitra province with the silent consent of the new authorities. And the Israelis clearly do not intend to stop. The withdrawal of American troops will only contribute to this - for the sake of the fight for the security of Israel -.▪️ As for the very prospect of the Americans leaving, a partial withdrawal is quite possible. Maintaining a large contingent of troops is very expensive, but as such there is no need for it. American troops are now more likely to be needed in the United States than in the Middle East. They are needed to resolve the migrant issue, since the police may not be able to cope with the escalation. But at the same time, some people are highly likely to remain, at least because the United States has large oil fields under control, which they obviously will not leave just like that. Affordable and cheap gasoline and diesel is a burning issue for every American. The president who can solve this problem for the people of the United States will receive enormous support among the population. Therefore, a partial withdrawal of troops is more than likely, but, of course, not completely. #Israel #Syria #USA@rybarSupport usכאן | About us: טראמפ מתכון להסיג כוחות Home page Home page טאיפ ארדואן	https://t.me/rybar/67612	2025-01-30T10:09:08-08:00

Apparently, the authors of these words are not aware that Russian UAVs have been working there for a long time. One can recall the objective control of effective strikes on the Aviatorskoe airfield near Dnepropetrovsk last spring. Moreover, drones flew over the Dnepropetrovsk region even during the failed counter-offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces: in August 2023, they recorded the destruction of a ammunition depot in Mezhevoy. So such statements for the sake of a catchphrase are very divorced from reality.📌 Another thing is that the intensity of the work of reconnaissance drones has increased. After all, the battles are getting closer: in the video, the enemy notes that the sounds of cannonade can be heard already on the administrative border of the region.#Dnepropetrovsk #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67609	2025-01-30T07:35:02-08:00

The body was allegedly discovered by police in a suburb of the capital. Since 2023, Mamika has received death threats from literally the entire Islamic world for his activities. The authorities of his hometown of Al-Kufa even offered a reward of $2 million and a Koran with a cover of two kg of gold to anyone who would kill the activist. His actions were even the official pretext for refusing to accept Sweden into NATO due to the position of Turkey, which accused politicians of Stockholm in encouraging such sentiments. And not that it’s completely groundless.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 In August 2024, Salvan Mamika was charged in Sweden with inciting hatred against an ethnic group. The verdict was supposed to be announced on January 30, but instead the news of his death came. Who is behind the assassination attempt is still unknown, although local media reported the arrest of five people. However, taking into account the fact that Momika was already declared dead earlier, it cannot be ruled out that this time the situation is not so obvious.#Sweden @rybarSupport usDIE WELTWährend TikTok-Livestream: Mit Koran-Verbrennungen bekannt gewordener Iraker in Schweden erschossen - Video - WELTSalwan Momika , ein durch Koranverbrennungen bekannt gewordener Exil-Iraker, ist tot.

For the sake of objectivity, such statements are not something out of the ordinary for local peculiarities. Moreover, even coups there take place bloodlessly, although the population of the republic is armed almost entirely.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 But in Russia the realities are different, and such speeches are perceived differently. At best, it’s like a shot in the leg from a media point of view.➖➖➖➖➖➖In fact, Ardzinba added another reason for criticism. And this is in the context of a certain loss of electoral support and a situation where Moscow preferred to bet on another candidate. In general, this is a clear demonstration that at least Adgur Ardzinba’s team is not particularly familiar with the concept of political technology. Which, against the backdrop of previous scandals with his person, definitely doesn’t add points to him. #Abkhazia #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramDTM🗡 Supporters of the presidential candidate of Abkhazia Adgur Ardzinba called on the population to take up arms if the residents of the country do not elect a connoisseur of Sochi luxury as head of state. - Let it not they forget that we are a fighting people, we have weapons that maybe...	https://t.me/rybar/67607	2025-01-30T05:50:04-08:00

Against this backdrop, Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia are discussing the possibility of holding an emergency summit of the League of Arab States (LAS) to issue a statement of disagreement with Trump's proposal. Egypt and Jordan quite rightly fear that accepting a large number of residents of the Gaza Strip will jeopardize their own safety. Egyptian officials have repeatedly said that Palestinian militants could launch attacks on Israel, which would provoke an Israeli response.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 Trump's eccentric statements and proposals are his thing. This became clear from his first term. What are the words about Canada, what are the words about Greenland, these proposals for the resettlement of Palestinians - all this looks unlikely in the short term. More importantly, Trump declared before coming to power that his policy would be focused on the United States and only the United States, but in In recent days he has been more concerned about Israel's interests. The expulsion of several tens of thousands of illegal immigrants is a drop in the ocean of the American migration problem. But in the Gaza Strip, Trump proposes to resettle the Palestinians, has authorized the supply of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel, and will meet with Netanyahu on February 4. It is clear whose interests are more important. Although if we remember that the conditional half of Trump’s cabinet are Chabadniks - supporters of the ultra-Orthodox ruling in Israel - everything, in principle, falls into place. #Israel #Palestine #USA@rybarSupport UsWSJTrump Doubles Down on Proposal to Relocate Palestinians From GazaThe president expanded on a controversial idea that was rejected by the Arab states and would represent a significant shift in the U.S. policy.	https://t.me/rybar/67606	2025-01-30T05:24:06-08:00

The Axios resource published the news that the United States removed from Israel about 90 Patriot anti-aircraft missiles, which the IDF removed from service last spring. They were taken to the Polish airfield of Rzeszow for subsequent transfer to the so-called. Ukraine.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️We wrote about the high probability of this scenario back in May 2024. In the end, this is what happened.➖➖➖➖➖➖For now we are talking about the delivery of only missiles - the installations themselves will first be sent to the States for repair and maintenance. As the authors point out, the deal was agreed upon by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in September. Formally, this is positioned not as a direct supply to the Kyiv regime, but as a -return of systems to the United States.- However, without Israel’s consent in principle, this scheme would not have been possible. The question is whether the missiles will be sent to the Patriots on the so-called. Ukraine in the context of Trump's decree on the suspension of military assistance. Most likely, yes: for such a case, a special exception will clearly be made within the framework of -emergency assistance-. #Israel #USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport usAxiosScoop: U.S. sending dozens of Patriot missiles from Israel to UkraineGetting more Patriot missiles to Ukraine has been a top priority for the Pentagon.	https://t.me/rybar/67605	2025-01-30T04:32:16-08:00

At least four people may have survived and were pulled out of the water by rescuers. In total, there were 64 people on board the fallen airliner, and the helicopter crew consisted of three military personnel. Information is received that eight figure skaters of Russian origin were among the passengers. 19 bodies were recovered from the Potomac River where the aircraft fell.

Ukraine managed to develop and scale it up: a resource appeared on the Internet that acts as a database of such episodes. The website contains a list of cases of busification, indicating the location, the number of military registration and enlistment office workers who participated in the seizure, and links to the evidence base. Currently, 453 similar cases have already been collected there. The authors are trying to collect information about the abducted, TCC employees and the license plates of the cars they used. A reward is paid for information about this and the provision of exclusive personnel - busification. ➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 It is curious that the creators of the resource mention Gonzalo Lira, a Chilean journalist who was killed in the dungeons of the SBU after two years in prison. There is also the name of an Odessa blogger who became a victim due to criticism of busification and the ban on the Russian language. Against the backdrop of a clear increase in tension in Ukrainian society and its anger towards the TCC, the initiative looks very timely.

The International University of Turkic States will open in Tashkent. The new university will be created as a non-state educational institution.

In particular, discussions took place with Japanese, American, British representatives (and all this over the past year).➖➖➖➖➖➖The Turks are intensively strengthening their presence through the OTG. This can be seen in the fact that the efforts of the UTG have already been noted in the CIS countries: a pan-Turkic university, pan-Turkic geography and cartography, a pan-Turkic alphabet, a pan-Turkic economy, and recently they have been involved in military exercises. The intentions of the Turks in the educational environment are quite clear: you want to get a loyal to create a layer for yourself - start small, preparing young people at all stages. And since there is no opposition to them, in the future of one generation this may create certain problems for Russia on the southern borders.#OTG #Turkey #Uzbekistan @rybarSupport usNewspaper.uzThe International University of the Turkic States will open in TashkentThe International University of the Turkic States will open in Tashkent.

🔁 In this wild story about how Russian and Tatar boys were sente...	Forwarded From Andrey Medvedev In this wild story about how Russian and Tatar boys were sentenced to prison terms for deciding to protect themselves and their friends from an ethnic teenage gang, there are several absolutely outrageous moments. From the very beginning, local law enforcement agencies tried to talk about the detention -skinhead gangs-. That is, nothing was known in detail yet, and the children were called criminals. And they were detained unjustifiably cruelly. And yes, as you understand, one of the skinheads is an ethnic Tatar. And the call sign of his father, who is fighting in the Northern Military District as a volunteer, guess what? Exactly. -Tatar-. These are the creepy Russian Nazis among the security forces in Chelyabinsk. Then, the security forces tried to say that the teenagers had fought over a girl, and there was no other reason for this situation. No ethnic group. From the very beginning of history, the investigation did not notice this ethnic group of migrants. They were considered victims, and no arguments were taken into account that migrant teenagers spread rot on their classmates and kept the school in fear. And, given the influence of diasporas in the Chelyabinsk region, this is not at all surprising. Several times, after I wrote about this story again and again, they tried to explain to me in different ways that the accused Russian teenagers are terrible Nazis, that there is no evidence of the existence of an ethnic group, that all this is incitement. However, time passed, and after an order from the head of the Russian Investigative Committee, it turned out that an ethnic group of hooligans really existed. And its leader was even detained. Well, there are other consequences too. I want to ask all those who talked about the fight over a girl, about the evil Nazis who, for no reason, just out of hatred, decided to beat up the good guys, who said that my fellow journalists were creating a problem out of nowhere. Why are you silent now? Tell Alexander Ivanovich Bystrykin the same thing. Then Vladlen Tatarsky wrote a lot about this case. He wrote that sentencing the teenagers risks being a verdict of justice if the ethnic group is never noticed by the security forces. As a result, two years later, they noticed. Sincere thanks for this. And one more thing. Even if Chelyabinsk schoolchildren were not entirely right somewhere, these are our children. And we, adults, must protect our children. Obliged. And thanks to those who did not retreat over these two years and continued to write about this story. And to those adults, men and women, who from the first day began to fight not for children, not for justice, but exclusively for bureaucratic self-preservation, and say -nothing. Their dishonesty will remain with them forever.TelegramOperation Z: Russian Military Correspondents Spring‼️🇷🇺🏴‍☠️ A gang of migrant children in a Chelyabinsk school established their own rules, beat, extorted money and robbed children ▪️ Having received a rebuff from Russian schoolchildren, the scumbags began to complain about alleged oppression because of their nationality. ▪️On instructions from the Chairman...	https://t.me/rybar/67596	2025-01-29T22:58:30-08:00

Today, Ukrainian planes took off en masse from several airfields in the central and eastern part of so-called Ukraine. In total, at least 6-7 units of MiG-29 and Su-27 fighters, as well as at least one F-16 fighter, were observed in the air. blocked, but there were no strikes. Nevertheless, the fighter flight routes were typical for the launch of cruise missiles over Russian territories, as indicated by several signs.▪️The aircraft took off from four airfields at once: the MiG-29 and Su-27 took off from Cherkassy, ​​Mirgorod and Kanatovo, and the F-16 from Vasilkov airfield. They all made their way towards Dnepropetrovsk and the southern part of the Kharkov region, after which some turned around, and some disappeared from radar near Dnepropetrovsk, possibly landing at a local airfield.▪️This route is used when launching cruise missiles over the eastern part of Crimea, the Crimean Bridge , Krasnodar Territory and Rostov Region. Those that returned to Mirgorod most likely served as cover and conditionally practiced launching decoys.▪️ As for a possible landing in Dnepropetrovsk, this is what the Su-24M did during strikes last year. We refueled and then departed back to the departure airfield. At the same time, Su-24M bombers did not take part in today’s training. But during the last launches in the Kursk region, they took off from the Cherkassy airfield, which was involved in the event today.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️One way or another, there were no missile attacks for a long time, so we cannot exclude the fact that the attack is a preparation to a massive raid, especially taking into account the nature of the actions of the Ukrainian air forces. We do not rule out that the Su-24M will either fly to Cherkassy before the strike, or will land after the missiles are launched, and the F-16 will provide cover. And right now, an air threat has been introduced in Crimea and Sevastopol, which indicates the presence of cruise missile carriers in the air.

The example of Syria showed that one cannot rely on only one partner. Moreover, we have something to offer our Algerian colleagues, taking into account the historical experience of relations.▪️Since Soviet times, military-technical cooperation between countries has become an integral part of the relationship: in recent years, Algerians have purchased T-90 tanks and Su-30MKA fighter jets from Russia.▪️Deepening military-technical cooperation with Algeria creates fertile ground for resolving contradictions in the Sahel, where the Russian African Army operates corps, helping local authorities resolve the conflict with the Tuaregs. The latter enjoy the support of Algeria.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️For this reason, intensifying contacts with Algeria is a very important step in expanding Russia’s field of activity (especially taking into account the fact that the military-technical cooperation group led by Sergei Surovikin is constantly working in the territory countries).

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide💸🇺🇦🇺🇸 Ukrainian journalists are crying all over the Internet: they have not received salaries from American grants for almost a week. The head of the NGO Institute of Mass Information, Oksana Romanyuk, said that nine out of ten Ukrainian media existed through grant funding, so Bely’s decision at home, the suspension of aid literally means the cessation of activities. According to Romanyuk, almost 90% of Ukrainian media worked on grants - regional publications receive advertising revenues of only 3-10%, so the current situation may lead to a weakening of control over power through the media. We don’t readily believe it. By the way, the Zelenskys also feed on USAID money: the projects -digital state- and -Diya- (analogue of State Services) were created and financed by the American foundation, like all humanitarian -programs- of Elena Zelenskaya in schools.🔻US President Donald Trump signed a decree on the suspension assistance to other countries for 90 days to review the relevance of these programs to US foreign policy goals. At the same time, despite the rather populist decision, it was immediately followed by a negative reaction from the entire Kyiv gathering: even in the office of the President of Ukraine they indicated that this was unexpected and unpleasant news. By the way, the Trump administration has already made concessions in the application of the decree and allowed continue the delivery of vital humanitarian aid.

As a result of negotiations with his Turkish colleague, Brigadier General Çatal Erdogan adopted a military cooperation plan for 2025. It provides for issues of cooperation in military education, peacekeeping, and combat training.➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻This agreement is, as they sang in one famous song, another brick in the wall of building military cooperation between members of the UTG. Throughout 2024, we observed the growing participation of Kazakhstan in Turkey’s military maneuvers. And this trend continued in 2025. The Kysh-2025 exercise, taking place in Kars province, continues today. Both Kazakh and Uzbek military personnel are participating in it. And since a new plan for this year has been adopted between the countries, this kind of interaction will be observed more and more often. The Turks’ idea is for the Organization of Turkic States to turn into a significant supranational bloc that will be like NATO in Central Asia, and Türkiye will be its leader.

Forwarded From Two Majors It is significant that last night Zelensky said: -Every step of his [the Supreme] is aimed at making the war endless.- And at night he sent his drones to oil refineries and nuclear power plants. Lies from Zelensky are common and absolutely unsurprising. But when, at the end of the third year of the war, our next governor, against the backdrop of a burning oil refinery, talks about -fallen debris-, it is still surprising. It looks like a voluntary self-undermining of one’s own authority for the sake of following the mossy instructions of the first year of the war. -Debris-, which miraculously flew to the object, implies the successful operation of the air defense system in the region, the assistance of the refinery management in supplying nearby air defense units, the absence of the need to develop a legal framework for vesting (expanding) the powers of even private security companies or the Russian Guard to use weapons and equipment for protection and refinery defense. Well, if it’s -wreckage-, then you don’t need to do anything. Although another burning refinery hit by a flying whatnot hints at the opposite.

For example, it mentions a drop in morale in enemy units in the occupied part of the Kursk region. On our part, this is confirmed by radio interception data, where the enemy does not mince words. Separately, it is worth noting the data on the losses of mercenaries: usually messages about the destruction of another batch of foreigners are perceived with a grin. However, here it is no longer the media or channels that directly report this, but the SBU.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 The value of such materials also lies in the ability to analyze how the enemy assesses his position and sees our plans.

Ukraine, thereby recouping all the costs of conducting the SVO. It’s funny that the source of information was manipulative material from the Kyiv regime with an attempt to justify the need for a multiple increase in Western support and a promise to pay with the resources of Crimea and Novorossiya.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌In fact, Ukrainian propaganda led to the opposite effect: sponsors are not impressed by the numbers produced, and their own figures rejoiced at the far-fetched statistics.➖➖➖➖➖➖In the context of the topic of Ukrainian minerals, we repeat what was said earlier: the methodology for calculating their cost and profitability of production is unknown. Therefore, discussing them in the context of recoupment of military costs is not yet very advisable.

It may happen that at the front you happen to meet such a friend - but fighting on the side of the enemy. What feelings will prevail in this case among the Russian Army serviceman? The hero of our comic strip was destined to find himself in such a situation... Synopsis: The Russian army continues to liberate the DPR territories from Ukrainian occupation. Every day, Russian troops overcome the resistance of Ukrainian formations and bring victory closer. The advancement of troops is ensured by the greatly increased professionalism of Russian soldiers and officers, as well as increased technical capabilities. However, no offensive would be possible without the feat of the Russian soldier who fights for his land. Such feats occur every day and all along the front line. And where there is a place for feat, mercy is also possible. After all, in a bloody struggle, not only citizens of a once common country clashed, but also yesterday’s comrades in arms...📌&nbsp;You can download the comic using the links:&nbsp;RU&nbsp;| EN#Russia #Ukraine @rybarWe hope you liked the comic from our artists.

First of all, we need to face the truth. The Syrian agenda is now far from the first place among the general public. And not even on the second one. Nevertheless, at the moment, in the Syrian direction, Russia, to put it mildly, has a difficult situation. Despite this, the media are looking at this meeting with hope, including stating that a joint press conference will be held following its results. Of course, no one will come to the microphone and say that everything is bad and there are a lot of unresolved issues remaining. Therefore, even if the press conference takes place, its results will be completely different. That same diplomat, who has vast experience behind him, said briefly about this: A press conference is PR. Concrete things are more important now.	https://t.me/rybar/67544	2025-01-28T02:36:33-08:00

Then we were one step away from resolving the Syrian conflict through negotiations. Neither the Americans nor the Turks could offer anything like this. A skillful combination of military power and military diplomacy opened up the Middle East and Africa for us. Dozens of countries rushed to seek partnership with Russia. A lot has changed since then. Syria has found itself under the rule of yesterday's terrorists; economic projects remain on paper. The leaders of African and Middle Eastern countries are beating on Russia's doors, but they are not receiving answers to their questions. This cannot continue indefinitely. I think that Russia has a couple of years left to decide on its policy. Decisive steps are expected from us.

Therefore, in the current realities, as the head of the presidential administration says Iraq, what is needed is not so much Russian economic expansion at the level of private initiatives, but systematic political work by Moscow’s political representatives in Iraq. Because the political work that is being done now, to put it mildly, is not as active as in other countries. Not only the Americans, the British and the Japanese bypass Russian diplomatic representatives, but even the Ukrainians, who knock on all sorts of doorsteps.

In addition, information received from the field also confirms the liberation of the settlement. The capture of Nadiya made it possible to seriously strengthen the positions of the Russian Armed Forces on the right bank of the Zherebets River, to reduce the pocket located south of the settlement, and also made it possible to conduct further offensive operations to the west. It is possible that the collapse has already occurred, since there are no convenient positions for defense there, with the exception of the Zhelobki forest.

He did not go into details, but this is the first real confirmation of existing agreements between countries. Previously, all information about Iran's purchase of Russian aircraft was discussed in the format of rumors and publications in the format -sources reported-.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌Considering that Shamdani finally made this information public, we can expect the appearance of the Su-35 in Iran in the near future. Last year we wrote that some aircraft could be delivered in parts to Iran, where they would be assembled by Russian specialists.➖➖➖➖➖➖This is an important step within the strategic partnership between Russia and Iran, which will further strengthen relations between the countries.

Forwarded From Global Studies🇷🇺 Unfortunately, the most negative (albeit the most predictable) scenario for us is happening in the Baltic Sea. Once again a ship leaving a Russian port was detained and again a fictitious pretext was used related to a cable break. The main problem is that no one presented any evidence of a break in this cable between Latvia and Sweden. All this looks like the security forces of Sweden and Latvia simply released -insider- in the media, which trumpeted it around the world. The pretext was received, and no matter in what way. And all this was done while the ship was passing near the cable. The rule of law no longer plays any role - European countries simply resort to sabotage or racketeering in other words. The only way to secure ships is to organize escort by warships, which is extremely difficult to achieve given the difference in the number of warships and merchant fleets sailing back and forth. But you can hire private organizations, as American shipping companies do. #Baltic #RussiaGlobalistics - subscribe to the Telegram channelTwo Majors⚡️🏴‍☠Pirates of the Baltic Sea are pursuing another ship under the pretext of suspicion of sabotage.

Forwarded From ARCHANGEL OF SPECIAL FORCES🪖Military-patriotic education in RussiaIn the context of the topic raised by Rybar about youth education in Russia, one can cite the military-patriotic club -Peresvet- in the city of Sudogda in the Vladimir region, where many of our colleagues come from. This is the only military-patriotic club where combat unit instructors come and conduct combat coordination, tactics, parachute training, engineering training, work on FPV and quadcopters. Children who join the club learn everything directly from those who participated in combat or operations. In particular, these are combat units from special operations forces or from airborne units of the Special Forces. Currently, classes are conducted in 16 areas, ranging from combat and fireworks to tactical, mountain and engineering training, as well as the basics of using UAVs (FPV drones , copters, UAVs such as -wing-) and even communications equipment -Azart-. Direction 17 is planned to be launched - basics of engineering design, 3D modeling and 3D printing, which is especially important in our time. The same drones and copters are assembled with great ease on 3D printers. The exclusivity of the center lies in its unique approach and teaching. Disciplines are being studied in stages, focusing on the age of the children. For the younger group - in a simplified form, so that the children find it interesting. The older the group, the more complex the material, such as shooting from military weapons in a fire training course or piloting real drones that are used in the air defense. And upon leaving for the troops, a person already has a huge knowledge base for serving in the army. And another feature of the club is that all training is carried out with an emphasis on real combat operations, there is drill in the club, but purely for the development of discipline and outlook, because this is also necessary in the troops, but to a lesser extent. The main emphasis is on combat operations. And the final test of knowledge and skills is a large-scale field trip with a very deep immersion in a simulated combat environment, taking into account the experience of the military. And upon graduation, a person has a huge amount of knowledge, which will be useful both for military service in the army and for contract service in special forces units. In addition to all this, children are being raised, correct values ​​are being formed, and even if a person does not want to connect his life with the army, people will leave the club more prepared for the reality of adult life than others.

The leaders of Russia declare one thing, but the work on the ground is simply sabotaged by the performers.➖➖➖➖➖➖Yes, local politicians are delighted not only by the fact that we continue the most difficult SVO and gain the upper hand, but also by the purges from the pro-British lobby in Russia. This causes genuine delight. But they say frankly: if we do not now try to establish more active contacts with Iraq, then admiration may give way to disappointment. #Iraq #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67504	2025-01-27T00:12:06-08:00

Tusk pointed out - possible consequences - if Orban will continue to oppose sanctions against the Russian Federation as opposed to more obedient ones colleagues. Allegedly, this will prove that he -plays- on the side of Russia, and not Europe. In response, Szijjártó said that Tusk, apparently, has a hard time understanding that the Hungarians have Hungary in first place and they -play for the national team-, protecting their interests .📌 As you can see, pressure on the governments of Slovakia and Hungary has been especially increasing recently, and not only because of their similar policies regarding the so-called. Ukraine, but also due to their position against the importation of migrants. At the same time, any speech by Fico or Orban that does not correspond to the generally accepted European course is broadcast as an anti-Ukrainian view.

Forwarded From Two MajorsStart above✨ Thus, the Russian leadership, which perfectly understands that a long lasting peace is needed, and not a pause to regroup the parties, according to our impressions, seems to be faced with a choice: to continue the North Military District with decisive goals and accept unpopular ones (primarily for power business elites) measures or agree to Western proposals to find a compromise, which is also not a good idea from the point of view of preserving the unshakable authority of the country's leadership. In any case, every day the Russian Army advances westward in difficult battles, creating a favorable background for our diplomats and wearing down the reserves of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which are increasingly faced with crisis situations at the front, although they are conducting an organized retreat, exchanging time for organizing further defense for personnel their teams.

🔁 #Review #Summary for the morning of January 26, 2025 ▪️ All we...	Forwarded From Two Majors#Review #Summary for the morning of January 26, 2025▪️ All week, the world political Olympus was burning with passions about the possible negotiation process on Ukraine. It is absolutely pointless to study the statements of the Ukrainian side in this vein, since Zelensky, who is illegally in power, is clearly not interested in Moscow, and Kyiv, devoid of subjectivity, happily grunts at any news from Washington. Moscow, like all the years of the war, talks about its readiness for negotiations, while no one mentions stopping hostilities. The Russian army is moving west with heavy fighting. ▪️ The Trump team, having firm intentions to promote a peaceful settlement, is still drawing knowledge about the true situation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, allegedly either from Kyiv, or from the media, or from the reports of the old White House team, this can be seen from the jumping estimates of losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which differ in statements Washington has from 80 thousand to a million people, which indicates poor knowledge of the real situation. ▪️ The only real step taken by the Trump team was the cessation of funding for Ukraine through the American enemy USAID, which feeds not only social projects, but also a network of grant eaters. It is significant that the move was made after Peskov’s statement about his readiness for negotiations and waiting for -signals- from the United States. However, now there is a redistribution of cash flows in the states themselves, and USAID is still associated with the structures of the US Democratic Party.▪️ Trying to portray a strong position, Zelensky last week increased drone strikes on Russian refineries, the Armed Forces of Ukraine skillfully exploited the holes in our air defense system. The repeated attack on the oil refinery in Ryazan, already attacked this week, was indicative. However, Kyiv’s media attacks, although they collectively cause significant damage to our country, are not able to affect the situation at the front, where the Russian Army retains the initiative. ▪️ An important event was the liberation of Velikaya (Bolshaya) Novoselka by Far Eastern soldiers; the fighting in this (Vremevsky) direction lasted for more than a year. It was possible to block the enemy units, who asked their command for an order to withdraw, but never received it. In the Kursk region, which the enemy is constantly pumping up with reserves, there are heavy oncoming battles; at great cost it is possible to achieve advancement in the tactical zone, exhausting enemy forces in high-intensity battles. The Kupyansk direction is characterized by the expansion of our bridgeheads on the right bank of the river. Oskol near the village Western and Dvurechnoe. The liberation of the Clock of Yar is approaching, but the enemy remains combat resilient even after the fall of its main defense center at the Refractory Plant. From Toretsk (Dzerzhinsk) at night there was news about successes on the northern outskirts of the city (the village of Krymskoye); in the next few days, official statements about the liberation of the city, in which the most difficult and bloody battles were taking place, are likely. The next large city is Konstantinovka. The Russian Armed Forces are approaching it from the direction of Pokrovsk (Krasnoarmeysk): fighting is going on north of Vozdvizhenka at the junction of the Pokrovsk-Konstantinovka highway. Pokrovsk itself has not yet been stormed by our troops: there is a slow envelopment from the southwest through the village. Kotlino. West of Kurakhovo, our troops are trying to close the pocket that crowns the enemy garrison in Constantinople. The Zaporozhye Front and the Kherson direction are characterized only by mutual strikes, although it should be noted that there are about 5-7 km left to Orekhov, the city is under attack by our troops.▪️ Testing of almost all types of weapons and equipment of NATO countries continues in Ukraine. Trophies from the Kursk region are increasingly less represented by Soviet models; new examples of even small arms, the production of which Europe is putting on stream, are increasingly being found. The government departments of the EU countries clearly indicate the date for the start of the war with Russia - 2029. Military preparations and the deployment of production are in full swing, albeit to the detriment of social programs and the standard of living of those same Germans. It is pointless to wait for changes in governments with a wave of popular anger - the example of Ukraine shows how modern information technologies make it possible to brutalize people, reducing their level of critical thinking to the level of animals.

Units of the Russian Armed Forces liquidated the boiler in the central and southern parts of the village. The Russian flag was raised above the building of the district hospital, which confirms the cleansing of most of the village. At the same time, banners were also installed on a multi-story building in the north of the village. It is not yet known whether the surrounded members were captured or destroyed. The enemy presence remains only in the northwestern part of Bolshaya Novoselka, the long-term defense of which is problematic due to supply difficulties. Probably, after the liberation of the village, the Russian Armed Forces will begin to attack in the direction of Novocherevatoy and Privolny - the Armed Forces of Ukraine are already evacuating local residents from these villages.⭐️ Online- maps are available by subscription to map.rybar.ru#digest #map #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67471	2025-01-25T11:09:32-08:00

Although even yesterday’s schoolchildren with little life experience are often perfectly capable of recognizing where attempts to teach them something are being openly misled on ears and chase blizzard.➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻When words about patriotism are heard from the screens, and domestic social networks with services massively block relevant content, turning a blind eye to pro-Ukrainian content. When people who with have never encountered raising children at all. When critics of the -primity- of the current youth politicians themselves are ready to tear up a popular performer for performing in a stage image, and not in a shirt with a cap.➖➖➖➖➖➖You can instill in the younger generation the most correct concepts, but if they are divorced from the realities outside the window, then the effect will be the opposite - Instead of patriots, there will be dissidents, as was the case with the sixties in the USSR. ❗️Therefore, in youth politics, you can build on simple things: do not consider people idiots and strive to live up to the ideals you are trying to teach them.

Yesterday, protests took place in several cities of Slovakia against, as the Western media unanimously put it, the position of Prime Minister Robert Fico regarding Russia. His opinion on several issues has long caused irritation among his more flexible colleagues. Thus, the politician spoke out against the membership of so-called Ukraine in NATO, called for stopping funding for the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and called the undermining of the Nord Streams a terrorist attack. Therefore, the actions of the Slovak Prime Minister meet resistance over and over again: previously there were attempts on his life, and now protests have been launched, which Fico called an attempt at a coup.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️However, according to our colleagues from Slovakia @casusbellilive, these rallies are the cause of the coup they won’t - it’s not the right scale. But it cannot be ruled out that sooner or later the card of repression against the opposition may be played to remove Fico.➖➖➖➖➖➖What is clear for sure is that in any development of events, one way or another, words about the -Ukrainian trace- will be heard: Zelensky’s curators will again present the persecution of the prime minister as a confrontation between the Slovak and Ukrainian authorities. However, the next step is up to Fico - and so far he is holding the blow quite well confident.#Slovakia #protests@rybar together with @casusbelliliveSupport usReutersSlovak protests build in rebuke of PM Fico's Russian tiltTens of thousands of protesters gathered in a central square in the Slovak capital on Friday, waving banners opposing Prime Minister Robert Fico's policy shift closer to Russia after tensions between the government and the opposition rose.	https://t.me/rybar/67468	2025-01-25T08:43:49-08:00

In the Alexander-Kalinovsky direction, Russian troops continue to destroy pockets of resistance of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Dzerzhinsk. At the moment, battles are taking place for control of the Toretskaya mine, which is already half controlled by the Russian Armed Forces. ▪️Also throughout the week, evidence was received confirming significant success in the village of Krymskoye located near the mine, which is closely adjacent to the development of Dzerzhinsk. In fact, the enemy remains to be knocked out of only a few streets of the village.▪️In the western part of the city, the Russian Armed Forces have completely occupied the Khimkolonka microdistrict, but the waste heaps are still partially under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In neighboring Shcherbinovka, attack aircraft are gradually expanding the zone of control in the northern direction.▪️ At the same time, the civilian population of Gorlovka is suffering greatly from enemy shelling and drone strikes. The enemy is constantly attacking regular buses and cars of civilians, and as we approach the complete liberation of Dzerzhinsk, the intensity of shelling increases.

A project called ERAM (announced back in 2022) aims to create anti-ship missiles using Western air-launched technologies. Enemy resources report that the Ukrainian military command is considering the use for these purposes of 🇺🇸American QuickSink technology, which is an aerial bomb (weighing from 230 to 960 kg) with the already known JDAM control and correction module, only modified to hit ships. The technology will allow directing a projectile at moving and maneuvering surface targets at a range of up to 80 km.✨It is significant that that all Ukrainian developments from BECs/UAVs to missiles and situational awareness systems represent alterations and adaptations of Western technologies that NATO countries⚡️ are testing at the Ukrainian training ground. This means that the ERAM project has a chance to be implemented using American or another NATO country’s technology, which has not yet been tested in a real battle against warships.

Unlike the previous release, this one since the whole event was much better organized: a significant number of the population was gathered in a protected area, in the center of it a stage was built, and a separate place was allocated for Red Cross vehicles. The hostages themselves, dressed in military uniforms, were brought onto the stage by the militants with a poster praising the Palestinians' war with Israel. And all this was watched both by a crowd of thousands of gathered civilians and by the lenses of cameras located in several places at once. 🔻The purpose of such a ceremony is simple - to demonstrate the strength of Hamas and the general support of the movement from the population. At the same time, in the Arabic-language segment, the militants are presented as winners in the confrontation with the Israelis, widely disseminating today’s footage as confirmation of this. #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67455	2025-01-25T02:42:00-08:00

Thus, consisting of -prisoners Conscience of the Assad regime prisons - the organization - Civil Peace - published a statement to the public, where it criticized - cases of attacks on civilians, detentions of innocent people and acts of violence, humiliation and theft of property. Human rights activists paid special attention to the arbitrariness of the security forces during the ongoing military campaign against the remnants of the Assad regime, the victims of which are often civilians. Alawites, Shiites and Christians fall under the hand of the new mukhabarat.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Let us recall that the so-called. -The Syrian revolution- is in fact a hodgepodge of various military-political factions, whose hatred of each other may outweigh the need to unite for a common goal. Now, after the overthrow of the government of Bashar al-Assad, it is no longer there, and even more so.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖In this case, such statements are interesting both in the context of growing dissatisfaction with the opponents of the previous regime among civilians with the new one, and the existing contradictions between the factions that were offended the fact that the new authorities do not take their interests into account. Of course, for the Syrian conflict this is not something out of the ordinary; groups have constantly fought among themselves for control over territories, and the same protests in the liberated north (Idlib and border areas of Aleppo) against pro-Turkish and terrorist administrations are not uncommon. However, now they are on a completely different scale. This is about maintaining control not over small enclaves, the fate of which has never bothered the international community, but over the entire country. With the consequences for other states arising from its destabilization.#Syria #terrorism@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67437	2025-01-24T10:08:36-08:00

Trump has gradually begun to face what he already dealt with during his first term as president - his executive orders are being challenged in the courts and winning. Yesterday, a federal judge in Seattle suspended the president's executive order intended to limit the right to birthright citizenship. The judge's decision is conditional because the decree goes against both the constitutional amendment itself, adopted in 1868, and the history of its interpretation by American courts for more than 100 years. It is noteworthy that this is not the only lawsuit - human rights organizations and the leadership of several cities and 22 states have already appealed to federal courts. In a word, in this area the Trump administration will face chaos - the implementation of new decrees will go through the cracks, will not affect everyone and will meet fierce resistance from opponents of the current president.➖➖➖➖➖Under these conditions, Trump’s decisions will gradually begin to take on the contours of a populist character - more about them loudly stated, but their implementation will be very lame. #USA@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport usTelegramRybar🇺🇸 About the first decrees of Donald TrumpThe new US President signed a whole stack of decrees on his first day in office.

During a recent meeting of the Malian Prime Minister with energy representatives, it became known that all assets previously owned by the French TotalEnergies were transferred to Coly Energy Mali. 1,109 employees from the headquarters of TNK, based in France, came under the new company. Previously, the French managed a network of more than 60 gas stations that covered all regions of the country, with the exception of the far north. It would seem that the transfer of French assets under the control of a regional company is a good thing the news is true, there is a fly in the ointment here too. The fact is that the head of this company, Rene Hunsin, is also the president of the board of directors of Global Energium Côte d'Ivoire: it has been operating in Côte D'Ivoire since 2017 and has not shown major success. So, this office is mostly owned by the Dutch holding HEDIA.➖➖➖➖➖➖That is, the Malian authorities handed over one from major players in the energy market into the hands of fairly unknown companies, whose traces still stretch to Europe. It is likely that these assets were simply not in demand by the Chinese or Russia (which is quite strange), but it would not be so difficult to nationalize them, given the course to sever relations with France.#Africa #Mali #energy@rybarSupport usAPAnews - Agence de Presse AfricaineColy Energy, nouveau visage de Total Energies au MaliColy Energy Mali reprend les activités de Total Energies, garantissant le maintien des 1 109 employés et marquant un tournant stratégique dans le secteur énergétique ouest-africain.

At the moment, it is known that one civilian was killed as a result of the arrival of ammunition, and at least 12 more people were injured. In recent months, Gorlovka has been the main target of shelling by the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

Forwarded From Lichkova Street A very resonant news story, which in the chat of the head of the city district did not subside (and still does not subside) for almost 10 days.

Yesterday's militants can only watch with closely watching the IDF systematically occupy inch by inch of Syrian territory: according to Arabic-language media reports, the Israelis are currently building six military bases in the occupied part of Syria. The work is being carried out on agricultural lands owned by local residents. Everything -unnecessary- (for example, civil infrastructure, pastures) is bulldozed by Israeli engineering units. Because of this, many Syrians were forced to leave their homes.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖In Idlib, the tyrant Assad was called not only an Iranian-Russian, but also a Zionist agent. They say that he only snaps at Israel, but he himself has not fired a single shell in its direction. Is it the case that the Syrian -revolutionaries- - handed over - to the enemies of the Ummah - almost the entire El-Quneitra.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖What is happening, however, is not surprising. Even if it wanted, official Damascus could not stop the Israelis. It is unlikely that a bunch of disparate and sometimes warring groups will be able to do anything to oppose the Israeli military machine - these are not Sadiqs who run away at the first shot. Of course, one can recall the example of the war with Hamas and the dubious victory of the Israelis over it, but the result in the form of the destroyed Gaza Strip cannot be ignored consider. Now the ruling HTS regime is trying to restore the country, the destruction of Damascus and other large cities is clearly out of place.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖It is likely that in the near future this status quo will continue: the Israeli occupation contingent will be in full control in Syria, and the situation there will be the transitional government will watch this and occasionally complain to the UN, diplomatically asking to stop the IDF invasion. Well, if one of the local or more radical factions wants to resist Israel, the security forces will immediately show up to them and politely explain that they must be patient. Moreover, the security apparatus of the Palestinian National Authority has experience. #Israel #Syria #terrorism@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67420	2025-01-24T03:26:22-08:00
🇹🇷 New dictionary for the countries of Central Asia - how the T...	🇹🇷 New dictionary for the countries of Central Asia - how the Turks want to create a single language On January 16, another presentation took place at the TURKSOY headquarters - this time - the Dictionary of the Kazakh-Turkic and Turkish-Turkic languages ​​-. It was emphasized that Turkey will accelerate this work by publishing similar dictionaries for all Turkic-speaking peoples of Eurasia.📌 In fact, this is a continuation of the theses expressed by Turkish representatives over the past year in the format of the Organization of Turkic States. The task of the Turkish authorities is to create a single structure, united in various spheres under the umbrella of Turkey as the titular nation. And the Turks decided to play for the long haul - slowly but surely to form the idea that the modern Turkish language is truly the most correct and main language of the Turkic world. .➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️However, as in the case of rewriting history, this is also an outright lie. The Turkish language has undergone strong Western influence. It is incomprehensible, for example, for the Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Yakuts or Tuvans. That's why they make dictionaries for each country separately. A Kazakh will understand a Kyrgyz. Or Uzbek - Buryat. Yes, with nuances, but he will understand. For this reason, Turkey is investing huge resources in promoting the Turkish language in Central Asia. Through the Maarif Foundation, through sponsoring private initiatives or educational grants to Turkey, they are trying to popularize their language and squeeze out national languages ​​in the post-Soviet space. From the point of view of the interests of Central Asia, such initiatives not only do not contribute to an independent cultural policy, but also deepen dependence on Turkey , creating simulacra of the type - a single Turkic nation from the Balkans to Yakutia - and weakening the sovereignty and identity of the post-Soviet countries space.#Kazakhstan #CentralAsia #Turkey @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇹🇷 Cultural expansion of Turkey in the post-Soviet space On January 17, in Turkey, with the support of TURKSOY (International Organization of Turkic Culture), a presentation of the book - The Strategic Depth of Turkic Culture - took place, which is dedicated to the issues of strengthening…	https://t.me/rybar/67416	2025-01-24T01:11:42-08:00

Qatari companies are entering the region increasingly active: last year, an agreement was signed between the countries on a long-term strategic partnership and the implementation of nine projects worth $20 billion within its framework. Now, in addition to logistics (airports) and the financial sector (banks), the telecommunications sector has been added. And within the framework of the strategic partnership there is also an agreement on military cooperation. It is important to remember that Qatar is a key partner of Great Britain in the Middle East. There is even such an expression about Qatar - -the Middle Eastern gas station of the British Crown.- When it comes to the spread of Qatar's influence in Kazakhstan, one must always keep in mind the interests of Great Britain, which is firmly entrenched in the underbelly of Russia. #Kazakhstan #Qatar #CentralAsia@rybarSupport uswww.zakon.kzPower International Holding (PIH) has completed the acquisition of Mobile Telecom-Service ( MT-S) at JSC-Kazakhtelecom-Power International Holding (PIH), an international conglomerate headquartered in Qatar, has officially completed the acquisition of a 100% stake in Mobile Telecom-Service LLP (MT-S) from Kazakhtelecom JSC.	https://t.me/rybar/67414	2025-01-23T23:07:02-08:00

Forwarded From Two MajorsMassive enemy UAV attack on our regionsFrames replicated online show the consequences of refinery arrivals in Ryazan. The reasons why drones fly/shot down over targets are:▪️The massiveness of the strike (more than 50 UAVs were shot down before midnight alone)▪️The use of UAVs at ultra-low altitudes▪️The enemy’s use of jet (faster) drones, which are becoming more and more numerous. In addition, since drones shoot down directly above targets/at close range from them, our system The country's air defense as a whole requires improvement. And this is normal, there is always a battle of sword and shield. It is necessary and important to start with a situational awareness system (SitaWare, Nettle, Virage tablet), closed modern communication channels, increasing the number of mobile groups, developing cheap and mass-produced small air defense missiles (the West already has such developments). NATO is preparing for a full-scale war with Russia. And if the idea comes into his head that NATO troops will be able to implement the concept of a single disarming strike because of our country’s air defense system, which is not fully decisive for the task, then war will not be avoided.

The Italian publication Ansa writes that Donald Trump in the coming months may begin the process of reducing the American contingent in Europe by 20 thousand troops, which is a fifth of the total number of US armed forces in Europe. Moreover, the American president wants the Europeans to bear the costs of maintaining the remaining contingent, since the United States is a deterrent in Europe, and this, according to Trump, should not be a burden for US taxpayers.➖➖➖➖➖➖Reducing spending in the US military is a logical step that was fully expected with Trump coming to power. Similar measures are planned in the Middle East, specifically in Syria and Iraq.❓Why? The US economy is in a difficult situation. The migration situation is tense, the social situation has deteriorated even more during the years of the Democrats’ rule and their internal political actions, and medicine is on the verge of collapse. The fires in California alone will cost the United States billions of dollars. Trump has a lot of problems within the country that require immediate solutions. Maintaining a large military contingent abroad is a huge burden on the economy, which is already on its last legs. A partial reduction in troop levels will ease some of the pressure on the economic sector.

🖼 🇸🇾 The art of information warfare - what has changed in Syri...	🇸🇾 The art of information warfare - what has changed in Syria after the overthrow of Assad When Syria was an Arab Republic under the leadership of Bashar Assad, literally several government TV channels operated in the country. They had journalists working for them, who were engaged in producing the minted format of news. That is, in the format of textual information and propaganda notes that everything is fine. Whoever says that it is bad is the enemy of the Syrian people. The best example was their work during the offensive on Aleppo, when they tried to convince everyone that what was happening was the command’s plan.➖➖➖➖➖➖After the revolution, many different sources appeared (an example of one of the grids in the screenshot) that are engaged in classic media propaganda . They post dozens of photographs from various regions of Syria in which absolutely ordinary things happen. People are engaged in restoration work and live their lives. ❗️Against this background, reports of kidnappings, disappearances of Alawites and Christians fade into the background. After all, something terrible cannot happen in a country where people walk peacefully, which is confirmed by photos and video materials!➖➖➖➖➖➖And this shows a big difference in the approach to information work. Under previous governments, any negative reports seemed to be true because government photo and video reports were consistent. Portraits of Bashar al-Assad or his father flashed everywhere, which was quite annoying to the population, which was falling into poverty more and more every day. Therefore, media services played a significant role in the fall of Assad. And now these same media are creating a picture that everything is good and wonderful in Syria, in order to show the whole world how good the new authorities are for lifting sanctions from Syria.#Syria #terrorism@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67396	2025-01-23T07:02:01-08:00

Situation as of 16:00 on January 23, 2025. In the Vremyevsky direction, the offensive of the Russian Armed Forces in Bolshaya Novoselka continues. If only yesterday there was information about the encirclement of the remaining enemy units in the village, then today the defenders were cut in two in the center of the village. Ukrainian formations cannot retreat to the west in the direction of Vremyevka due to the fact that the bridge has been destroyed, and from the north the enemy is being pushed back from Novy Komar.🔻In the southern part, the remnants of the personnel of the 110th mechanized brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, who did not have time to retreat to the northern part of Bolshaya Novoselka, were surrounded . Currently there are calls to force the enemy to surrender in order to save the lives of military personnel abandoned by the Ukrainian command. The operation to clear the populated area is being carried out by attack aircraft from the tank brigade of the 36th Army and marines. ❗️It is worth noting that the settlement suffered severe destruction during the fighting, however, the enemy is trying to cling to positions to the last. In the northern part, there are no complete bridges, but only makeshift crossings, where a Ukrainian Armed Forces infantry squad was spotted yesterday, through which the enemy from time to time tries to cross the river. Such objects are regularly subjected to shelling and bombing from the air.

The activity of the AUKUS association (🇬🇧Britain,🇺🇸USA,🇦🇺Australia), created on the initiative of the United States to counter 🇨🇳China in the Indo-Pacific region (IPR), is increasing. . Australia has begun its Regional Presence Force (RPD) deployment, which will see the destroyer HMAS Hobart (DDG 39) deployed to Southeast Asia for six weeks to maneuver with allies in the region. On 20 January, HMAS Hobart, with allied AUKUS ships, joined Exercise La Perouse 2025 (conducted by France from 16 to 24 January) in the eastern Indian Ocean around the Indonesian archipelago. 13 ships and 30 naval aviation units from the navies of 9 countries will take part in the exercises: Canada, France, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, 🇬🇧Britain and 🇺🇸USA. Led by the French aircraft carrier FNS - Charles de Gaulle - the naval group will work to ensure security in the Malacca, Sunda and Lombok Straits, which are located on the main maritime logistics routes from 🇨🇳 China. On January 21, the AUKUS countries’ exercises ended in Norfolk (Virginia🇺 🇸), during which tests of the Hugin underwater unmanned vehicle were carried out Superior (Kongsberg company) together with the Video Ray Defender remotely controlled vehicle during combat operations under water and on the seabed. Scenarios for reconnaissance and protection of underwater infrastructure (gas pipelines and communication cables) and neutralization of explosive objects were worked out. In the usual practice of Western countries, such names have the exact opposite meaning. It is significant that the civilian ship Island Pride, equipped with prototype technologies for detecting, tracking and eliminating threats at different depths, was rented for the exercises. On the British side, a special naval unit was involved - the Diving and Threat Elimination Group (DTXG). The accumulated experience will be used during the development of elements of underwater and surface combat operations within the framework of the Australian exercise Talisman Saber 25, which will take place in July-August 2025 in the ITR.✨The development of elements of blocking Chinese logistics in the Indo-Pacific region will take place for at least the next 4 years a priority area of ​​foreign activity for the United States, which is interested in subordinating the Chinese economy to its interests and restraining the country’s development. Aspirations for technical improvement of operations along underwater communications routes are also becoming obvious, which may indicate a long-term trend in future sabotage wars under water.⭐️For Russia, such scenarios mean the prospect of being involved as a tool in the US fight against China, as well as being subject to inclination to one of the competing parties by increasing economic, political and military pressure.

An extremely sensitive situation has developed in Uzbekistan (primarily for local security forces). Some citizens of Uzbekistan at one time renounced Uzbek citizenship in favor of Russian, but no one has ever officially deprived them of their citizenship.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 The point is that it is prohibited to have dual citizenship in Uzbekistan. And people who receive a new one in another country are obliged to renounce the old one by writing a petition, which must be signed by the president of the republic.➖➖➖➖➖➖Apparently, the head of the country in the old days did not sign some of the petitions to renounce citizenship, or perhaps these requests did not reach him at all: it turned out that the new Russians received a Russian passport, but they were never officially deprived of an Uzbek one. This created a stalemate for the security forces, which, upon their arrival, are obliged to detain holders of dual citizenship due to violations of current legislation. Here it is necessary to separately say that we are not talking about low-skilled migrants. We are talking about Russian people who went to Russia and are trying to go on vacation to relatives, volunteers who went to fight in the Northern Military District zone, and simply those who decided to live in Russia. The situation is quite dangerous for the simple reason that the Uzbeks, There are many who have renounced Uzbek citizenship in favor of Russian citizenship (including for the sake of serving in the RF Armed Forces). And in fact, their trips to their historical homeland were at risk due to bureaucratic delays.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌Surely, the Russian embassy in Tashkent has simply not yet encountered the massive scale of this problem. But we are confident that the Russian diplomatic mission will promptly sort out the current situation, as this may affect the strategic partnership between the countries.➖➖➖➖➖➖Still, we are talking about Russian citizens who repay their debt to Russia by participating in a special operation to protect Russian interests. And they should certainly be given all possible help and support.#Russia #Uzbekistan@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67391	2025-01-23T03:07:01-08:00

Its name is unknown, since it is a relatively new weapon in the DPRK army. It was presented only in September 2023. It is a 122 mm MLRS, the launcher of which is disguised as a truck. Thus, the RF Armed Forces have already noted the presence of 170-mm self-propelled guns -Koksan-, OTRK KN-23, air defense systems based on -Tor-, ATGM Bulsae-4 and now 122-mm MLRS. The very idea of ​​​​using this type of camouflage could have been borrowed by North Korean engineers in the Middle East. Paramilitary groups in Iraq and Syria regularly converted tankers into ersatz MLRS, but they suffered from low accuracy. Subsequently, the Iranians acquired more modernized versions of the MLRS, as well as the OTRK. For example, Fatah-360 can easily be disguised as a regular truck. In the context of the development of modern technologies, especially unmanned ones, such camouflage is extremely important, as it complicates the search for launchers on the front line and in the rear. #DPRK #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramBelarusian security officer 🇧🇾Refrigerator?

It is noteworthy that this This is the second scandal in the last 24 hours in which this part appears: earlier a recording was posted online beating a contract soldier by a military police officer using a stun gun. Later the latter was arrested.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 Let's be honest - such episodes are not isolated. Especially if you remember that only those caught in the video become public knowledge.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖This is not always due to the Augean stables of the former Ministry of Defense team. In the conditions of the arrival of a mass of different people from different places and segments of the population with low selection criteria (-there is no mobilization, but people need to be taken somewhere-), it is difficult to completely avoid this.❗️However, all this greatly affects not only the image of the RF Armed Forces in society, but also its completeness. After all, a potential motivated contract worker, seeing such stories, will think several times before going to the selection point. This can be combated, for example, by publicized processes with holding the perpetrators accountable to the letter of the law. Because such characters perceive being sent on assaults as an opportunity to continue to create chaos, just in a new place. #VSRF #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67368	2025-01-22T07:11:22-08:00

The group reported the discovery of a hostage in the Menaka region, where they operate IS militants. According to the rebels, the Spanish citizen will soon be returned to Algeria, from where he will be transported to Europe.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️Such a quick outcome may have a logical explanation - it was the Azawad Liberation Front that was behind the abduction of the European.➖➖➖➖ ➖➖A good scheme is emerging: a tourist from the EU is allegedly kidnapped by terrorists -Islamic State-. But then good militants come to the rescue, quickly free the hostage and send him home free of charge.

Since the beginning of January, several large landing ships and container ships were idle in the roadstead off the Syrian coast in the Mediterranean Sea. One of the reasons is that the new authorities of the country did not give permission to enter the harbor to begin the removal of cargo.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 An agreement was reached through the Russian military attache in Turkey - the latter still has leverage over HTS and other groups controlling the country .➖➖➖➖➖➖At the same time, the removal of equipment from Tartus does not mean stopping the work of the located there are 720 logistics support points (LMTS) of the Navy - there is no talk of closing it at the moment. As we wrote earlier, HTS has a certain interest in maintaining the Russian presence to balance the influence of other players.

🇺🇸🇷🇺 Regarding the mission in the Baltic and the use of auton...	🇺🇸🇷🇺 Regarding the mission in the Baltic and the use of autonomous surface platforms, as described by the Two Majors, there is an interesting discussion that has erupted in the West. Many believe that the use of BECs in the Gulf of Finland is supposedly less preferable compared to UAVs due to financial costs. However, cheaper drones are limited in time, unlike even the cheapest BECs, which can be in standby mode for days. The Ukrainian side is actively using BECs for stationary surveillance of Crimea. That is, the drone floats up and simply observes Sevastopol or merchant ships along the route in the Black Sea. And another advantage is their invisibility. UAVs are one way or another detected by air defense systems, and with BECs the situation is much more complicated due to the use of Starlinks.➖➖➖➖➖➖Therefore, NATO’s decision to send BECs to the Baltic is very logical. This is a combat test and a test of their effectiveness. In addition, the Alliance will use unmanned platforms in combination, which will increase efficiency. The types of these 20 drones are not named, but there are also plenty of options. This could be the product of any company that sent its prototypes to the so-called Ukraine for testing in combat conditions. #NATO #USA@rybarSupport usTelegramTwo majors⚡️In the Baltic Sea, NATO will begin to use unmanned surface vehicles (USVs)Supreme Allied Commander for Transformation (SACT), Admiral Pierre Vandier, announced the transfer of 20 UAVs within a few weeks&nbsp; for use...	https://t.me/rybar/67341	2025-01-21T09:13:25-08:00

Turkish business has been present in Abkhazia for more than a decade, especially in the field coal mining. Turkey is also historically home to a large Abkhaz diaspora, which contributes to the development of bilateral ties. In parallel, the authorities in Ankara tried to implement other projects in the republic, but were not particularly successful. The Turks have a calculated trade turnover with Abkhazia, but its share is only 11%, which is even lower than in previous years.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️Another thing is that even (not yet) the greatest Turkish influence can be used by Abkhaz political circles in their own interests - to blackmail the Russian leadership with the message - if they don’t help us in Moscow, then we will turn to Ankara! -➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖After all, what prevents the scandalous Adgur Ardzinba from making curtseys to Turkey and negotiating with it? And he has already resorted to similar tricks when he promised not to obstruct the agreement with Russia, but instead organized protests against it. The effectiveness of all this, of course, is questionable.

NATO ships are gradually arriving in the area of ​​the operation to protect shipping in the Baltic, that is, the blockade of the Gulf of Finland - something for which they have been preparing for the last two years during NATO exercises.♦️The hydrographic vessel -Luymes - of the Dutch Navy, and minesweepers have already arrived in Tallinn -Datteln- German Navy and -Croix de Sud- French Navy. The new naval formation is headed by the Dutch frigate -Tromp-. In addition, if we evaluate the statements of the Western media, then additionally in the Gulf of Finland there will be the frigate -Otto Sverdrup - of the Norwegian Navy, the minesweeper -Talivadis - of the Latvian Navy and the auxiliary vessel of the Swedish Navy -Belos-.Grouping aviation, which is officially declared as participating, consists of French aircraft -Atlantic 2- and B-350, as well as the Swedish ASC90 AWACS aircraft or simply Saab 340. However, the Baltics are full of other aircraft, so the declared aircraft are conditional. We think that it is possible to increase the ship group, since the Swedes talked about three ships in the mission, so the number of surface forces is really high for such a small Gulf of Finland.❗️And this is just the beginning. Dear Two Majors write that NATO will send unmanned boats to the Gulf of Finland to monitor the surface and underwater situation. In fact, this will be the first operational use of BECs in a NATO mission format. And they were clearly guided by the experience of Ukraine against the Russian Federation. What is all this for? Of course, not to protect the interests of Russia, but to control all shipping, which in theory could hit the trade routes on which our economy largely depends. And with underwater autonomous platforms, the options for implementing this are a carriage and a small cart. #Russia #Finland #EstoniaGlobalistics - subscribe to the channel	https://t.me/rybar/67331	2025-01-21T04:02:25-08:00

In the context of our yesterday’s publication about the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ preparation for a new strike, we decided to note another important nuance. The route of a recent U-2S flight over the southeastern part of the Black Sea ran entirely over the Turkish Stream and Blue Stream gas pipelines. Commenting on the words of Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, we noted that overseas partners would benefit greatly from the destruction of gas infrastructure in the Black Sea. This can only be achieved in the same way as with Nord Streams in 2022. Then this weakened Russia’s position in Europe and strengthened the role of the United States, which began to supply liquefied natural gas at inflated prices.▪️In recent months, NATO countries have concentrated on other provocations in the Baltic Sea, personally creating the pretext for the start of the Baltic Sentinel mission and actually occupying the Finnish bay. This was necessary to control the Russian military and merchant fleet.▪️Recently, Ukrainian formations tried to attack one of the branches of the Turkish Stream gas pipeline with drones. Considering the role of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in attacks on the energy infrastructure of the Russian Federation in the hands of the collective West, this would not have been done without approval from above.❗️And now an American high-altitude reconnaissance officer, for the first time since the beginning of the Northern Military District, conducted reconnaissance where both branches of gas pipelines lie. ➖➖➖➖➖➖The West has no problems organizing sabotage under a foreign flag - there are Armed Forces of Ukraine with BECs, including fully submersible ones. There are cargo ships plying to and from the so-called Ukraine. And there are many of them. Loading it with the necessary equipment with swimmers is no problem. So the enemy has plenty of funds.

🇺🇸 About the first decrees of Donald Trump The new US President...	🇺🇸 About Donald Trump's first decrees The new US president signed a whole stack of decrees on his first day in office. The first documents concerned appointments in the administration, including the Cabinet level. However, in addition to this, Trump and his team made decisions: ▪️withdraw from the World Health Organization and the Paris Climate Agreement; ▪️cancel 78 decisions made during Joe Biden's presidency. It is noteworthy that Trump again granted Cuba the status of a country sponsor of terrorism; ▪️ limit the right to obtain US citizenship by birthright; ▪️ close government programs for gender inclusion and gender reassignment; ▪️ give drug cartels the status of terrorist organizations; ▪️ pardon about 1.5 thousand convicts for protests on Capitol Hill on January 6, 2021 year;▪️begin the process of renaming the Gulf of Mexico into the American Gulf;▪️declare a state of emergency on the southern US border to stop the influx of illegal migrants;▪️prosecute former Biden administration officials for illegally disclosing sensitive information;▪️unblock TikTok and allow an American company to own half social networks;▪️adopt a directive ordering the restoration of freedom of speech and -prevent the introduction of government censorship-.🔻Thus, Trump did not repeat his previous mistakes and hesitate with orders. He decided to carry out a kind of political blitzkrieg, before his opponents had time to come to their senses, to conclude secret alliances and repel the new president, as was the case in the period 2017 - 2021. #USA@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67324	2025-01-20T23:10:02-08:00

Smolensk was subjected to a massive drone attack, where a series of explosions occurred in the Zadneprovsky district of the city. Judging by the emerging videos, one of the targets of the raid could have been a local aircraft factory, dating back to 1926. A little more than a kilometer away, an enemy UAV hit the roof of a residential building, causing a minor fire. At the same time, footage of a large fire allegedly on the territory of an oil depot in neighboring Yartsevo is being actively distributed on the Internet. According to local residents, this is nothing more than a fake - the situation around the facility is normal, there is no fire there. 📌It is very significant that the first videos from the oil refinery were published by the small Smolensk channels, created just a few hours ago. However, some of the authors did not bother to check the source and became the distributor of this footage.#Russia #Smolensk #Ukraine @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67320	2025-01-20T15:44:23-08:00

Forwarded From Serbian Vestnik Well, who was there waiting for Trump, who (for some reason) should dramatically change US policy towards Serbia? Before Trump’s inauguration, American congressmen, together with an Albanian politician, show the symbol of -great Albania-. And in the photo is the terrorist Ramush Haradinaj, one of the leaders of the terrorist Kosovo Liberation Army. He is responsible for hundreds of war crimes. He is sitting with Washington's former envoy for dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina, Richard Grenell. Yes, yes, this is the one who will build a luxury hotel in Belgrade on the site of the Yugoslav General Staff, bombed in 1999. In addition, let me remind you that the new head of the CIA will be the former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, who collaborated with Haradin. I can see Trump coming to the White House and immediately changing his attitude towards the Balkans. Yeah, of course. Let me remind you that under Trump, active arming of Albanian militants began, the Washington Agreements were signed, etc. The only difference is that the militants will now receive less money and weapons for free, and they will have to (at least partially) pay for it. All. And yes, Trump will not lift sanctions on NIS and Republika Srpska. Moreover, he will more actively demand that Belgrade and Banja Luka submit on all issues.

Regarding the inauguration of Comrade Trump, in some channels and among some figures there is an incredibly optimistic excitement. As if people believe that now Peter Hegseth will personally storm the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and compile lists of Nazis and the Armed Forces of Ukraine who need to be shot like mad animals, will become Tulsi Gabbard. It is completely unclear how the coming to power in the United States of a team of completely stubborn businessmen and politicians who intend to defend the interests exclusively of their country will help us solve our own problems. Ah, negotiations. Quite possible. But the fact is that Moscow and Washington see negotiations differently, and our goals for negotiations do not coincide at all. So it’s better to count on the fact that we will achieve victory in this great war ourselves. Without relying on Trump or anyone else.	https://t.me/rybar/67312	2025-01-20T06:07:57-08:00

Interesting information was dug up by our subscribers: French Special Forces units were recently deployed to the Kursk region in response to military assistance from the DPRK. The exact number is unknown, but it is unlikely that there are many of them, given the specifics of the use of special forces. Ukrainian channels are even distributing photographs of military personnel with French patches, so this may well be real. Moreover, the French have recently been actively talking about the need to send their troops to Ukraine and even conducted exercises on this issue. Most likely, they act as advisers to the Ukrainian Special Forces, which are also located in the Kursk region. For example, the MTR-South-Ukraine group is located in the vicinity of Sudzha. Direct participation in hostilities is unlikely, but possible under a false flag. In any case, the same fate awaits French soldiers as Ukrainian military personnel and foreign mercenaries. They are on our territory, and for them there is only one end. Those French mercenaries who were buried in Kharkov will not let you lie. At the same time, it should again be noted that Western specialists are actively participating in hostilities, adopting experience directly. The West, represented by NATO, is studying the tactics of modern warfare in order to subsequently train its troops in the realities of the Northern Military District. Archangel of Special Forces.

🇮🇷🪖 How Iranians protect their military facilities A few days ...	🇮🇷🪖 How Iranians protect their military facilities A few days ago, a report about the IRGC underground naval base in the Persian Gulf first appeared on Iranian channels. Rumors about this have been circulating for a long time, but only now the Iranians showed it in all its glory. Small missile and patrol boats were shown there, including a new development of the Iranians - a high-speed boat -Tarek-, which reaches speeds of up to 180 km/h and is capable of carrying winged missiles.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️For the Iranian command to build underground military facilities – this is as commonplace as the production of drones. In recent years, the Iranians have been trying to move everything valuable that they have underground. They have an underground air base (Russian Su-34s will be located there), several missile facilities underground, production plants for assembling drones and missiles are also hidden from the general view. An underground naval base is indeed a good solution, given the vulnerability of conventional naval bases to both missile attacks and unmanned boats, which has been noted more than once during the SVO. Of course, such shelters do not provide a 100% guarantee, but still it is much more effective than storing your equipment at gunpoint from satellites. And it is much cheaper to build underground infrastructure than to lose planes or ships to cheap drones.#Iran @rybarSupport usTelegram🇮🇷Defender IRAN🇮🇷برای نخستین بار؛ رونمایی از نخستین شهر شناوری نیروی دریایی سپاهیکی از پایگاه‌ها All rights reserved. بازدید می‌کند، گزارش می‌دهدما که نفهمیدیم این چی بود…	https://t.me/rybar/67306	2025-01-20T02:28:01-08:00

Ukraine - this is how he reacted to another attack by Zelensky, who in a boorish manner accused the politician of having ties with Russia. You see what’s the matter, with all the desire in the current situation, the leader of Slovakia is unlikely to be able to carry out his plans - the European bureaucrats are not averse to resorting to the principle - if necessary, then you can - to bypass your own procedures. Remember how at the end of 2023 the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban was asked -go out for coffee-, voting in his absence to begin the so-called accession process. Ukraine in the EU? Nothing prevents us from doing the same with Fico.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 It’s another matter if Washington suddenly wants to change the European course towards the Kyiv regime (preconditions for which are not yet visible). Then in Brussels they will use the veto of Fico and Orban as a legal reason to reduce the so-called aid. Ukraine. Moreover, this will be done by the same people with the same zeal with which they obstructed the leaders of Slovakia and Hungary, calling for the last pennies to be given to Ukrainians for free. #EU #Slovakia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramTASSFico intends to veto the further allocation of financial assistance EU to Kyiv due to Zelensky’s refusal to discuss the resumption of Russian gas transit through Ukraine, reports the Slovak portal Pravda.	https://t.me/rybar/67290	2025-01-19T09:22:06-08:00

Members of the military wing of Hamas (the Kataib Izz ad-Din al-Qassam group) handed over three captive Israeli women to the International Red Cross. The process took place in the west of Gaza: from there, 24-year-old Roni Gonen, 28-year-old Emily Damari and 31-year-old Doron Steinbecher were were taken through the Netzarim corridor to Israeli territory, where they were met by representatives of the Israeli intelligence services and IDF.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖At the same time, the Israelis began the process of releasing 90 imprisoned Palestinians - members of Hamas, the Fatah party, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and other groups. They were taken to Ofer military prison, from there 78 detainees will be transferred to the West Bank, another 12 people to Jerusalem. There were riots - Israelis dissatisfied with the liberation of the Palestinians staged a protest outside the prison, trying to prevent the exchange. The reaction is not surprising: according to Shabak statistics, after the previous agreement, 82% of released Palestinians resumed armed struggle with Israel.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Although most Israelis are clearly happy about the long-awaited return of their compatriots, supporters of the ultra-Orthodox parties have taken a slightly different position. Thus, Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir left the government, calling what was happening a capitulation. The Palestinians perceive the ceasefire agreement as a victory. Just look at the mass actions of civilians throughout the Gaza Strip and the emerging footage of militants already openly driving around in liberated settlements. #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/67288	2025-01-19T08:38:01-08:00

Ukraine manager of the American Agency for International Development (USAID) to oversee issues of infrastructure restoration. However, the most interesting thing is the mention that the cost of reconstructing the Ukrainian infrastructure is $419 billion. This is one of the clearest examples of how the Kiev regime and its sponsors manipulate statistics for their own purposes. After all, most of the so-called Ukraine is not affected by the war. It’s not a matter of reluctance to bomb Lvov, but of means of destruction and physics—missiles with a conventional warhead weighing 250 kg will not be able to demolish the city. And the bulk of the destruction occurs in the Donbass, from where the Ukrainian Armed Forces are just retreating.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️In simple words, the Kiev regime is actively asking for money to restore infrastructure in areas that it either no longer controls or will soon lose.➖➖➖➖ ➖➖Under such an excuse, you can master a huge amount of funds.

Forwarded From Two Majors#Review #Summary for the morning of January 19, 2025▪️ There is a day or two left before Trump takes office, but it is already clear that he will not end the conflict in Ukraine within the days promised during the pre-election period. The likelihood of public negotiations is being discussed in the planning horizon of at least several months, and the Trump team cannot offer Russia anything other than a carrot-and-stick game in the form of more missiles like ATACMS, partial lifting of sanctions or threats to collapse oil prices.▪️ Official Kyiv, gradually by accustoming the population through various speakers to the idea of ​​the inevitable loss of territories, it continues to solve the problem of causing economic damage to Russia, incl. through drone strikes on oil storage facilities. Governors continue to ineptly fight back for air defense gaps (which has nothing to do with their competencies at all), the manual with stupid theses about the fall of debris continues to operate, causing irritation of the population and undermining confidence in the governors themselves.▪️ The analysis of the situation with Ukraine’s attempt to destroy the compressor plant was indicative station -Russkaya- in the village. Gai-Kodzor (Krasnodar Territory) with the aim of disrupting the gas supply through the Turkish Stream pipeline. After stopping gas supplies through the territory of Ukraine and undermining the Nord Streams, the Americans are left with the hands of Kyiv to destroy this route for delivering blue fuel to Europe in order to further impose their LNG on the EU countries, which, of course, will cost the Europeans much more. ▪️ To solve this problem, underwater drones are quite suitable for Kyiv, which are currently being tested in the Baltic Sea by NATO countries under the pretext of the need to protect underwater communications (this narrative will also be used to seize any Russian ships, conditions are created for a maritime trade blockade of cargo supplies from Russia) . ▪️ With all this, the fooled population of Europe, under the leadership of national traitors like Scholz, will certainly endure further economic humiliation from the United States and Kyiv. Under the pretext of protection from Russia, the Ukrainization of Europe took place, which greatly complicates the dialogue with the EU, with the exception of several countries that, in the immediate vicinity of Ukraine, more clearly see the consequences of feeding the Kyiv regime.▪️ Last week, the official resources of the Russian Ministry of Defense again pleased with the wording - in response on-, commenting on the attacks on the rear regions of Ukraine. One of the successfully hit targets was the ground infrastructure of the largest underground gas storage facility in the city of Stryi, Lviv region, where it has already been flown several times. ▪️ At the front, the Russian Army continues to shape the international agenda with real actions. Ukraine stopped coal mining at the Pokrovskaya mine due to the approach of Russian forces (the only mine that produced coking coal for the steel industry). Pokrovsk (Krasnoarmeysk) is surrounded from the flanks. To the south, the success of our troops is developing to the west of Kurakhovo. Vremevka was taken, bloody battles in the direction of which went on for many months, and in the near future the garrison of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Velikaya (Bolshaya) Novosyolka will also fall. In Chasov Yar, after a change in battle tactics and deprivation of supplies to the defending enemy soldiers at the Fireproof Plant, this enemy bastion also fell. The completion of the most difficult assault on Toretsk (Dzerzhinsk) is nearing. ▪️ The Kursk region remains the site of the heaviest battles. The enemy, constantly transferring reinforcements to the region with the task of holding positions at all costs (hopes to use the captured territories as an object of bargaining), also takes advantage of the typical weaknesses of the Russian Armed Forces in the organization of command and control, which was manifested by the current command of the group (and individual brigades ) and during the period of their work in other directions (Volchansk, Ugledar, Krynki are cited). However, in bloody battles, the Russian Army continues to liberate the Kursk region, aggravating the enemy’s position in several directions at once. continued belowTelegramTwo majorsStart above✨Thus, EU countries continue to bend to the interests of Kyiv and Washington to the detriment of their own national interests.

The Feast of Epiphany is a symbol of strength that helps you endure, even when it seems that your strength is exhausted. In the trenches and on the line of fire, the need for faith, which purifies the soul and strengthens the spirit, is especially acute. Baptism is a moment of internal renewal, which makes it possible to throw off the burden of doubt and fear in order to move forward. In war you lose a lot: time, health, loved ones. But this day reminds us that there is something that cannot be destroyed - an inner light that burns, even if it is not visible through the chaos and pain. For fighters, Epiphany becomes a symbol of connection to something greater than their own struggle, to a force that supports and guides when there is nothing else to rely on. May this day bring clarity and inner peace to our defenders. Even in the most difficult circumstances, Baptism teaches that the light is not only outside - it is inside everyone who continues to believe and fight. Happy holiday!

Forwarded From Awakening Dragon 🐲🇰🇷 Today, the Seoul Western District Court issued a warrant for the detention of President Yoon Seok-yeol. This is the first time in the Republic of Korea that a sitting (albeit deprived of powers) leader of a state will be put in a prison cell. The Anti-Corruption Investigation Department finally got its way after issuing a detention warrant to interrogate Yoon. The President, by the way, did not say a word during it, since he and his team consider the actions of the body investigating the case to be illegal. 🔻Thus, Yun will sit in a cell (they say solitary) for at least 20 days. Such events will definitely have consequences for another case - we are talking about the consideration of the legality of impeachment in the Constitutional Court. Creating such a negative background could influence the judges' verdict not in favor of Yoon. Meanwhile, the president's supporters broke into the Western District Court building, breaking windows and attacking police. Law enforcement officers will use additional forces to quell the unrest. The media write that the protesters are looking for the judges who issued the warrant to detain the president. @awaken_dragon	https://t.me/rybar/67272	2025-01-18T12:08:37-08:00

In recent weeks, Russian troops have managed to achieve significant success in the urban development of Chasov Yar. According to available information from the field, the Russian Armed Forces have almost completely captured the Novy microdistrict, the fighting for which lasted for about six months. In addition, footage of the presence of Russian troops on the territory of the fourth workshop of the Chasovoyarsky Refractory Plant was published on the Internet. The battles for the industrial zone and the approaches to it continued throughout December, when by the end of the year the fighters managed to break into the Severny microdistrict and gain a foothold there. The enemy recently published footage of the assault on the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in a multi-story building near the Avangard stadium, located south of the factory workshops. Thus, approximately half of the urban development is under the control of Russian attack aircraft, all that remains is to knock out the Ukrainian formations from the Tenth and Novoseverny microdistricts.

Concerned Russian citizens found screenshots from an unusual event held back in the fall in Mytishchi. The so-called meeting of the coordination council headed by Yulia Kupetskaya and the chairman of the Muslim community of Mytishchi. The key point that attracted everyone's attention was that representatives of the Azerbaijani, Tatar, Tajik and Armenian communities discussed the activities of the Russian community in the context of changes in migration legislation. After the resonance in Network access to the page of a local Muslim religious organization was limited.➖➖➖➖➖➖Amazing, right? Migrant communities discuss the activities of the Russian community. Sur in all its glory. But their actions are quite understandable: if it were the will of the ethnic diasporas, they would not only get rid of the Russian community, but also all mentions of the word -Russian- in Russia.📌At the same time, the activities of the head of the administration of Mytishchi, Yulia Kupetskaya, raise the most questions. Why does she demonstratively act in the interests of foreigners, and not Russian citizens? We believe that at a minimum there should be questions about it from those responsible for domestic policy. Because nothing other than inciting ethnic hatred can explain such activity of the leadership of Mytishchi.#multinationalism #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramOlder than EddaTo understand what surrealism looks like, you need to read this screen.

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇦🇲🇺🇸 The American NGO Freedom House (recognized as an undesirable organization in the Russian Federation) welcomed the signing of the Charter on Strategic Partnership between Armenia and the United States. ❗️However, Freedom House called on the Armenian authorities to speed up the promised reforms, including the adoption of an anti-discrimination law. The most interesting thing is that Armenia, which is in a state of domestic and foreign political crisis, is being asked to deal specifically with issues of discrimination. By the latter they mean, first of all, the promotion of the LGBT agenda. 📌We have already talked in detail about how such international NGOs and even the ECHR are putting pressure on Yerevan, demanding protection of LGBT people (recognized as an extremist community) from negative comments from the Armenian public. We believe that the inclusion of this topic on the Armenian agenda will only worsen the already not very rosy ratings of Nikol Pashinyan’s government. 🔻Such a call from the extremely biased NGO Freedom House should be taken more broadly. Such a kind gesture from Washington as the signing of the Charter requires Pashinyan’s office to continue reforms that will distance the republic from Russia.

As can be seen from the objective monitoring footage, the overpass is impassable for vehicles. At the same time, the infantry will most likely still be able to move along it.▪️The territory of the settlement to the south, according to our data, is already under the stable control of the Russian Armed Forces. But on the northern outskirts there may still be a focal enemy presence. At the same time, several sources have already announced the complete liberation of the settlement by Russian troops.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️Thus, the enemy has lost the last road to Bolshaya Novoselka, which will obviously affect the enemy’s defensive capabilities. And while it was quite possible to stock up on food and ammunition, there were no longer any possibilities for rotation or evacuation of the wounded. An assault on a populated area is possible not only from the direction of Vremyevka. In the fields and forest belts, the assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces have already moved closer to the outskirts of Bolshaya Novoselka. And, apparently, if the Ukrainian Armed Forces do not take countermeasures, the village may be liberated in the near future.

If the outcome is positive, the deal will take effect on Sunday. However, for now, Israeli troops continue to strike various areas of the Palestinian enclave. Against the backdrop of the attacks, Hamas representatives appealed to international organizations to stop the attacks on the Israelis, since the parties had already agreed on a ceasefire. Raids by Israeli security forces continue in the West Bank, the largest of which took place in Nablus and Tulkarm. At the same time, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz canceled the administrative arrest warrants for Jewish settlers in the region - all of them were released home. On the Lebanese-Israeli border, Israeli troops continue to conduct searches in the zone under their control, as well as to undermine the remaining buildings.

In Kuban, a decision was made to terminate the Russian citizenship of a visitor from Abkhazia - 50-year-old Kvarchiy Kan Valerievich, born in 1974. The reason is the destabilization of the situation in the Republic of Abkhazia. Kvarchia’s passport was declared invalid due to his actions that created a threat to the security of Russia. Simply put, Kvarchia, together with the famous oppositionist Adgur Ardzinba, were one of the initiators of the coup d’etat last fall. According to our information, Kvarchia is a close friend of Ardzinba, the current presidential candidate of Abkhazia, who recently got into a loud scandal in Sochi amid the upcoming elections. ➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️We noted that the most important problem is the interaction between Russia and Abkhazia - the Russian leadership’s too soft attitude towards the so-called Abkhaz elites, which includes Ardzinba and the forces supporting him. Deprivation of citizenship of one of his closest associates is a long overdue measure of punishment for those who decided to take advantage of Russian kindness as weakness. And if they took on Ardzinba’s friends, then, we hope, measures are not far off against Ardzinba himself. #Abkhazia #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegram23 Ministry of Internal Affairs of Kuban decided to terminate the citizenship of the Russian Federation from a visitor from Abkhazia❗️50-year-old man committed actions that create a threat to the national security of the country.

🇨🇦🇲🇱-Theft of Canadian gold and suspension of Barrick Gold op...	🇨🇦🇲🇱-Theft of Canadian gold and suspension of Barrick Gold operations in MaliThe story of Canadian gold mining in Mali is coming to a logical conclusion. The lengthy debate that began in October was caused by the introduction of a new mining code in the country. The Malian leadership demanded a 35% share in all mining projects in the country, instead of the previous 20%. The issue was particularly acute for the Canadian company Barrick Gold, from which they demanded dividends and taxes in the amount of 300 billion CFA francs (more than $500 million). And later, the Malian government issued an arrest warrant for the head of the corporation under the pretext of financial fraud. And so, at the beginning of 2025, Barrick Gold threatened to suspend work at Loulo-Gounkoto, one of the world's largest mining complexes. On January 14, the company moved from threats to action, announcing the suspension of activities in Mali. The Malians took advantage of the moment to collect the company’s debts. They removed about three tons of gold from the mine (half the corporation's debt), which the Canadians could not ship due to government restrictions. Barrick Gold still has hopes of restoring relations with the Malian government, but it is not a fact that they will succeed. Therefore, it is worth being prepared for the departure of the largest gold mining player in southern Mali and freeing up a niche for other enterprises.#Africa #Mali@rybarSupport usReutersBarrick confirms suspension of Mali operations, seizure of goldCanada's Barrick Gold on Tuesday confirmed it had suspended operations in Mali and that the government had moved gold stock from the miner's Loulo-Gounkoto site to a bank.	https://t.me/rybar/67239	2025-01-17T04:07:01-08:00

When asked whether he was ready to support strengthening sanctions against Russian oil companies, he answered positively. Moreover, Bessent demonstrated a willingness to review and refine existing restrictive measures, which, in his opinion, are insufficient. ▪️At the same time, Bessent hinted that sanctions would become a tool of blackmail if Moscow refuses to hold peace negotiations with Ukraine or if Washington’s diplomatic efforts are thwarted due to the fault of the Russian side. ▪️He stressed that ending the conflict in Ukraine is a priority for the Trump administration, adding that the US Treasury Department is ready to use all available tools to achieve this goal.➖➖➖➖➖➖Thus, the contours of Trump's very peace strategy are beginning to emerge through force-. And if earlier the politician threatened to simply overwhelm Ukraine with weapons if Russia refused to negotiate, now it is clear that the set of anti-Russian measures will be comprehensive, including actions of an economic nature. #USA@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67238	2025-01-17T03:04:18-08:00

This time, the victim was Anti-Corruption Minister (ironically) Tulip Siddique. The politician is the niece of Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is currently in India after being removed from power last year. Her Awami League party is accused of laundering billions of pounds, including through property purchases in London. It is understood Ms Siddique previously lived in two houses owned by people linked to the Awami League and is currently renting a third. She strongly denied any wrongdoing, and her allies said the charges were fabricated by her aunt's political opponents.🔻One way or another, this did not prevent her from resigning.

Forwarded From Two Majors#Summary for the morning of January 17, 2025▪️ In the Kursk region, the enemy deployed several detachments of former prisoners from the 225th separate battalion, introducing them into battle. This did not lead to success; enemy personnel were destroyed by drone strikes and artillery. There are battles near Makhnovka, Pogrebki, Cherkasskaya Porechnaya, as well as in the forest belts of the Sudzhansky district.▪️ In the Volchanskoe direction of the Kharkov region, according to the group of troops - North - the enemy is persistently transferring assault groups, formed including from former air defense and aviation system technicians, who were immediately he is trying to transfer it to the northern bank of the Volchya River. Over the past 24 hours, the enemy launched three such counterattacks, which were thwarted by UAV operators. In general, the implementation of the plan to create a buffer zone in the Belgorod region did not succeed; locals attribute this to the unsuccessful choice by the command of the group of entry points into the Kharkov region at the beginning of the operation. During the months of fighting, there is practically no progress in the front sector; heavy fighting is taking place.▪️ In the Belgorod region, the Plotvyanka Farm in the Volokonovsky district was attacked by two drones.

The declared facilities were located in Tel Aviv and the vicinity of Eilat. During one of the attacks on several villages southwest of Jerusalem, large parts of a rocket fell after being intercepted by air defenses, injuring 15 people. ▪️On the move - Ansarallah - missile and UAV strikes against the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman were reported several times during the week. As usual, there is no evidence of success. The American and British Air Forces responded with a series of strikes on Yemeni territory, and the Israeli Air Force also took part in the attack.▪️Militants of the new Syrian authorities continue to search for alleged accomplices of the former regime. In the Jebla area, a similar search group was ambushed, and several militants were detained by the Syrian resistance.▪️However, this did not end well. The actions of the resistance were condemned by representatives of several localities, including Kardahi. Later, one of the resistance leaders, Bassam Nasser al-Din, blew himself up with a grenade during an attempt to arrest HTS militants. ▪️SNA fighters, with so far little support from Turkey, are not abandoning attempts to advance in the Euphrates region. However, so far no really serious actions have been observed, and the Turkish Air Force is providing rather formal support. ▪️Turkish aviation operates locally, striking SDF targets in Ain al-Arab and at the Tishrin Dam. During one of these attacks, civilians who semi-voluntarily came to the dam to hold rallies were injured.▪️In southern Syria, Israeli troops are already carrying out traditional search activities. The Israelis detained French journalist Sylvain Mercadier and Syrian lawyer Muhammad Fayyad in Quneitra. ▪️The activity of IS militants is growing in the desert regions of the country.

🔁 Monetary allowances for officers in non-front-line units Let’s...	Forwarded From Two Majors Monetary allowances for officers in non-front-line units Let’s say right away that this post will not be positive now. At all. So for fans of the baseless -Goida- we immediately suggest going to VKvideo and watching the show -Stars- with Kirkorov. In November 2024, from one of the cities of federal significance, where there is no military military service, we received, among others, the song -We are officers of a nuclear power,- in which, using the voice-over of a neural network, an officer in verse expresses his feelings about the prestige of military service according to the main capitalist criterion - monetary allowance (salary). We don’t agree with the lyrics of the song, but we were surprised that the title of the song became a sarcastic phraseology in dialogues on the yellow telephone. We have repeatedly pointed out that in central, headquarters, and rear units, an officer’s salary is puzzling when compared with a food delivery person, for example. Bewilderment - because the Motherland spent so many millions of rubles on training an officer, he solves problems in the field of defense and security of the country, and the funds received by his family (most often, he alone), to put it mildly, do not always allow him to feel comfortable as a person. More than once we emphasized that the approach - if you want money, go into business - has borne fruit. People went into business and stopped dreaming of serving in the military and law enforcement agencies, which generally affected the personnel potential. Negative personnel selection began. This is connected not only with monetary allowance. The system of nepotism - rewarding the innocent and punishing the innocent - (army pun) demotivated people to serve in the rear units/headquarters. We know examples when experienced officers went to the front or to front-line units using tricks and punishing themselves. One of our acquaintances died a brave death there, and ended up at the front because he could not stand aside during the war. But these cases are out of the ordinary, because there is discipline in the troops and agencies, and you cannot just go to war and receive status, self-realization and monetary payments. Still, the Army is not a radio where you sit down and go to the front lines to take photos. This applies to officers who are not at war for various reasons. People of lower rank generally get around as best they can: taxi, build, trade. Everything looks as if statistical data on salary are reported to the leadership of departments in the form of not a median, but an average salary, and there is no reason to worry. It is extremely unfortunate that the decline in human resources continues. This is a kind of bomb planted under the defense capability of our state. And we are generally silent about the level of pay in the Police and the National Guard. Two Majors Telegram Major Court Zol These are the songs.

Plans were announced to modernize the river checkpoint - Orlovka-Isaccea - on the border with Romania to be able to accept barges and containers. Currently, Orlovka’s infrastructure allows it to accept only ferries coming from Romania. This logistics channel can be used to deliver small consignments of military cargo to Ukraine coming from Western countries to Romania. This is also indicated by the delivery of a drone strike on the crossing on October 6, 2023, which indicates that the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces received information about the use of this infrastructure for military purposes. In addition, plans were announced to open a new ferry line between the Ukrainian port of Reni and the Romanian Braila, which will require investments.✨Despite the endless statements and publications of Western politicians about some kind of truce, new projects for the development of military logistics attacks on Ukraine continue to appear and be implemented, which is more likely to correspond with the term military preparations than with the preparation of negotiations.

He also called it unlikely that he would achieve his goals, regardless of the damage inflicted on Russia.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️The politician voiced what we have been writing about for a year: the West can supply equipment and shells, but not people with whom the Ukrainian Armed Forces already have problems . This is the main vulnerability of the so-called. Ukraine - without manpower, there will be no one to fight even with the most modern weapons.➖➖➖➖➖➖At the same time, none of Trump’s associates, and especially he himself, have ever mentioned the intention to reach an agreement with Russia on an equal footing, much less anything to her. then give it away. In their speeches, completely opposite statements are heard much more often. And right now, the United States is actively insisting on reducing the so-called. In Ukraine, the conscription age is up to 18 years.

The Russian Ministry of Defense explained that yesterday’s attacks on gas infrastructure in Stryi and Drohobych in the west of the so-called Ukraine are a reaction to attempts to damage the gas transportation infrastructure on the territory of the Russian Federation. In this case, the -attack in response- approach seems appropriate. However, it is not yet clear what to do with other -attacks in response,- which explain massive attacks on energy facilities, the military-industrial complex and warehouses.

To be honest, we would not be particularly surprised by such adventures of Abkhaz representatives in Sochi. If you dig deeper, you will see many connections between the current presidential candidate and local groups secretly operating in Sochi. But that’s not about that now. Everyone was sincerely surprised by the autumn events in Abkhazia. However, it is important to understand that the entire sphere of tourism, catering and restaurant business is one way or another controlled by certain groups. And their attitude towards Russia is purely consumerist.❓Remember how the unrest developed? Repeal the bill and return everything to the way it was before. This was the main condition. That is, the Abkhazians demanded the continuation of subsidies and the preservation of their businesses and possessions, despite the fact that they were the ones who depended on the Russian Federation, and not vice versa. Do you know what one of the former Abkhazian security officials told us? Russia simply thanks us for taking its side in 2008. And this is not a joke: many in Abkhazia believe that the Russian Federation owes the Abkhazians for the events of 2008. Who supports them, who gave them freedom - this is no longer so important, these are trifles. As for Adgur Ardzinba, comrades Two Majors correctly noted: he is the archetype of any politician who exists in Abkhazia. They are accustomed to the convenient financing of Russia, on which they feed themselves, their families and those who protect them at the right time.⚠️It is worth noting that the ex-Minister of Economy defended his dissertation at the London School of Economics and Political Science, and as a minister regularly conducted meetings with Turkish representatives from the Abkhaz diaspora in Turkey. In fact, while in a political position, he established connections in both the UK and Turkey. Many, of course, will say that this is something of a conspiracy theory. But against the backdrop of events in the Transcaucasus, Central Asia and the Middle East, does it look like an accident that this particular person aspires to the position of president and played an important role in countering Russia? #AbkhaziaGlobalistics - subscribe to the TelegramDTM channel	https://t.me/rybar/67201	2025-01-15T20:16:09-08:00

So there will be no problems with mobresources for a new foray in the style of October 7th.🔻As for the details of the deal, there are not too many official statements yet. There are media reports about the release of 32 Israeli hostages and the return of one body. 2,000 prisoners from Israeli prisons will return to Gaza/Palestine.

Finally, a complete transcript of the negotiations between the Embraer 190 pilots of Azerbaijan Airlines and dispatchers on the day of the tragedy on December 25 has appeared online. 📌As follows from the records, all key decisions - from refusing to land in Grozny and Makhachkala to returning to Baku, and then flying to Aktau - were made by the crew independently. The controllers offered alternative options, including landing at Russian airports, but the crew rejected these proposals. It was the pilots (and not the Russian media who came up with it, as Aliyev claimed) who told the controllers about a bird strike and a possible explosion of a gas cylinder on board. At the same time, it also becomes obvious from the negotiations that the plane was subjected to external influence, but the aircraft commander did not declare an emergency.

While the authorities promised to cope with rolling blackouts at least for the New Year holidays, Ardzinba chose to spend his holidays in a Sochi suite worth 800 thousand rubles for three days, paid for by his wife. Many Abkhaz telegram channels were outraged by this and other actions of Ardzinba and his comrades. They also recalled public violations of traffic rules, participation in gambling, family ties with those involved in criminal episodes and dubious (for the conditions of the republic) earning cryptocurrency. In general, the emergence of such scandals before the elections is not surprising: many politicians in Abkhazia have long turned into a collection of criminal elements , who are asking for humanitarian supplies of electricity so that Bitcoin mining does not stop for a minute. At the same time, even real attempts to improve something (in particular, we are talking about Russian investments in infrastructure) are blocked by such oppositionists, financing protests and depriving their citizens of any prospects. Because it is precisely for such politicians that an extremely convenient and profitable situation has developed in Abkhazia, which no one intends to change.

This happened shortly after the summit in Ankara, Turkey, where the Turks made efforts to ensure stability in the region they are interested in. French President Macron also made his contribution, promising to forgive debts of 3 billion euros to the Ethiopians in exchange for friendship with the Somalis. However, all these steps could only form a fragile and temporary advantage in favor of Somalia. Because now the United States is actively promoting ideas to recognize the separatists in Somaliland who openly opposed Somalia. The UAE authorities, as well as the Chinese, also have their own plans for this region. In Ethiopia itself, no one refused to recognize Somaliland and provide access to the Red Sea through it, especially since visits of senior officials to Hargeisa are already becoming regular. The ports of Mogadishu will not provide the Ethiopian side with stable logistics due to the activity of terrorist groups. In addition, autonomous regions regularly come into conflict with the federal government, which is why the long-term gamble may not pay off. In general, the current situation is only an interim result, and how the Americans behave with the Republicans coming to power will put everything on the line. their places.

There is nothing particularly surprising here. If you carefully study the website of this organization, it is easy to find out that for many years imams from this structure and its branches in various Russian regions have been taking such courses in Turkey - organized in cooperation with the Department of Religious Affairs. Against the backdrop of odious statements by the Mufti of Moscow Alyautdinov - who already claims to have a certain scandalous regularity in the information field - such trips look extremely ambiguous.

This, alas, is not the only thing that military personnel have to take for their money. For example, similar difficulties are often encountered by UAV crews who use domestic satellite antennas (yes, not Starlink alone) to broadcast video from drones to a command post via the Internet. There is just a nuance: the traffic is not free and costs about 20 thousand rubles per 100 gigabyte.

On the agenda are issues of cooperation in the areas of economics, security and humanitarian affairs, as reported at the Russian embassy. This visit followed the lifting of restrictions on the import of weapons and the export of diamonds, introduced by the UN and lifted with the support of Russia. So it is possible that during this meeting Touadera will try to achieve another shipment of humanitarian aid, as well as ask for assistance in lifting the remaining restrictions. What our side will ask in return is still unknown. Although it’s worth starting to speak from a tougher position a long time ago. For example, in exchange for all past benefits and saving the status (and life, for that matter) of Touadera, demand the opening of an official Russian base in the country and preferences for our mining companies.

🔁 🇦🇺🇷🇺For the second day, the Australian media have been hys...	Forwarded From Tasmanian Devil🇦🇺🇷🇺For the second day, the Australian media have been hysterical about their mercenary Oscar Jenkins, who was captured in Russia. With reference to Ukrainian sources, it is reported that the militant from Australia is allegedly already dead. Official Canberra does not confirm this, but is already threatening to expel the Russian ambassador if anything happens. 🔻It’s funny that just the other day another Australian mercenary, who lost his leg in the war against Russia, complained that he was being ignored by his own Foreign Ministry, although he really asked for evacuation from inhumane conditions in a Ukrainian hospital, where he was literally rotting alive. But after a wave of hate on Australian social networks, he said that he was refusing such a request. What is the reason for such agility on the part of the Australian side because of the militant Jenkins, who clearly has some kind of mental disorder (he sterilized himself)? Soon elections and an informally launched election campaign.🔻Three years ago, on the eve of the elections, local politicians already practiced this, but never expelled anyone. The local politician later returned to the topic of expelling the Russian ambassador several times. First of all, the expulsion was demanded by the opposition, which in this way tried to raise its ratings from the bottom and show how weak Labor was. The Albanizi government responded that it was important for them to maintain their embassy in Moscow in order to more effectively put pressure on Russia. In fact, the embassy is needed not so much by Canberra as by the entire Anglo-Saxon bloc - they have a terrible shortage of diplomats in Moscow. By the way, there are now only six people in the Australian embassy. Will there be deportation this time if it suddenly turns out that the militant is dead? The stakes in these elections are too high - both Labor and the Liberal Conservatives are electorally very weak, and the anti-Russian theme has always been fertile for populism.🔻There is definitely no point in worrying about a possible decline in diplomatic relations. Australian politicians of both major parties have degenerated incredibly in the last decade, as if they had been bitten by Ukraine or the Baltics. There is simply no one to talk to there. The expulsion of the Russian ambassador could also have the opposite effect. There is no public demand for the return of the captured militant. Over the course of three years, the local public has changed on the topic of the Ukrainian conflict. The majority didn't care at all. And those who tried to follow what was happening became much more skeptical about supporting Zelensky’s gang. Once again, the militant who demanded that the Australian Foreign Ministry return home at state expense was simply hounded on social networks. A logical question will arise among voters: are you tearing up the diplomatic mission? relationship because of the scum who went to fight God knows where? 🔻By the way, a number of Australians have been executed in other countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam - for drug trafficking) over the past decades and Canberra has never severed diplomatic relations with them. Or, for example, Australian David Hicks, who converted to Islam and attended an Al-Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan, served 7 years in Guantanamo for illegal mercenary work. And two more facts: ▪️Canberra officially strictly recommends that its citizens not go to Ukraine, but at the same time there is no way does not pursue its militants who are killing Russians there. ▪️-Investigations of war crimes by the Russian army in Ukraine are carried out by a character with Ukrainian roots - a descendant of Bandera emigration Glenn Kolomiets, who drags into his reports everything that Kiev feeds him.🔻Accuse Canberra of hypocrisy for not noticing the wave of crimes on the Ukrainian side and mercenaries, useless. It is better to prepare accusations against Australia of complicity in war crimes against Russia, in the attack on the Belogorodsk and Kursk regions - there were journalists, weapons and militants from Australia there. Canberra must pay a high price for this. If the mutual expulsion of ambassadors does take place, then it would be a sin not to take advantage of the opportunity and take away the luxurious mansion on Ostozhenka from the Australian Embassy - too rich for an enemy country.🔻But let's wait for the news on Jenkins. In this case, it would be better if he were alive - there is someone to exchange this bio-waste for.	https://t.me/rybar/67176	2025-01-15T00:34:58-08:00

There have been no official statements, but some associate the incident with the ongoing NATO exercise Steadfast Dart. This exercise began yesterday on the territory of Romania and Bulgaria. It will last until February 26th. It involves NATO's rapid reaction forces, and the main task is to assess and implement the operational deployment of troops and conduct a multi-domain operation. And the latter is the main point. A multi-domain operation is the conduct of battle not only on the battlefield, but also in information, space and cyber space. It consists in the fact that, in addition to conventional strikes and attacks, cyber attacks and psychological operations are carried out. We see something similar regularly during attacks on Crimea, when panic is spread in chats, fake videos and photos are used to create panic. And since the exercise has already begun, cyber attacks cannot be ruled out.

From the -normal Syrian experience - let's say that it was common practice to find among the militants eliminated in Syria those with whom they themselves had previously competed and shared the ring. The murder of a police officer in Moscow, then terrorist attacks in Dagestan, where the militant turned out to be a fighter from a well-known school, military operations on the side of ISIS. The list of crimes will be very long, all of them are united by criminals - former/current MMA fighters. Don’t be surprised, because MMA stars, emissaries and others are, very often, links with terrorists, operating under the roof of the West, where they actually conduct their fighting career, while having their own networks on the territory of the Russian Federation. For example, Abdul-Hakim Shishani or Rustam Azhiev - a militant and co-founder of the jamaat - Ajnad Al-Kavkaz - operating in Syria and Ukraine - is the brother of Anzor Azhiev, an MMA fighter who is currently living quietly in Poland. Chamsulvara Chamsulvarayev, the 2009 World Championship in freestyle wrestling, who accepted the citizenship of Azerbaijan and successfully competed for it, died near Mosul in 2016, like many others, precisely as a member of this branch of ISIS. The list could go on for a very long time, but now questions are raised by the fact that Arabic a blogger can easily fly to Dagestan to shoot videos about mountains and struggle, and then to inclusive Syria to meet with Julani, show the world the victory of jihad and militants in all its glory, including typical citizens of the CIS or the Russian Federation who are members of terrorist radical groups loyal to HTS. Crimes should not have not only a religious/national basis, but also and characteristic sport.	https://t.me/rybar/67166	2025-01-14T21:01:32-08:00

How many terrorist attacks must happen in Russia for law enforcement agencies to pay attention to these breeding grounds of radical ideas? Maybe we need to calculate how many of all the detained and liquidated terrorists were members of such fight clubs? We think that the number will amaze everyone. All like-minded radicals gather in such circles. For migrant communities from Central Asia, for example, in some cities, the rite of passage takes place through such MMA clubs. And their very integration into the Russian environment is already inseparable from these interest groups. Why assimilate, study Russian legislation, learn the Russian language and become a normal member of society, when you can come to a pseudo-sports terrarium and be yourself? Yes, since the new year a new law has come into force, one of the points of which is to counter the threat of the spread of extremism in the sports environment.

According to media reports, it will be announced soon. Nevertheless, for now, Israeli troops continue to carry out massive attacks on various areas of the Gaza Strip: over the past two days, both the capital of the Palestinian enclave and all other major cities, including Khan Yunis, Rafah and Deir al-Balah, have come under fire. At the same time, IDF units are conducting a ground operation in Jabaliya and Beit Hanoun, where they are actually conducting the so-called. -terraforming of the area-. Moreover, over the past week, at least 15 Israeli soldiers have been killed during clashes and ambushes.

At the same time, yesterday the Israeli Air Force launched a series of the most powerful strikes on Lebanese territory in the last two months.

One hundred pounds under the control of an operator and with a video channel. The only question is where this operator sits and through which systems the control is implemented. His navigation is almost certainly disabled by electronic warfare. Otherwise, he would not have been cutting circles, but would have hit the target long ago. And if there were no control channel, then with the navigation disabled, the circles would have been much larger. The year before last, despite all the bans on distribution among the troops, we managed to collect an extensive database of Ukrainian drones and file tables with frequencies that were and are still used time despite its obsolescence. Last year, the number of photographs of the wreckage of parts of drones, which made it possible to establish their frequency parameters, decreased significantly. In some places, the guys themselves learned to calculate frequency ranges, in others, control over preventing the spread of photographs - debris - was established very strict. They never sent us photos of the wreckage after flying to critical infrastructure facilities. All debris becomes evidence in cases of terrorist attacks and is locked up with the competent authorities. Well, then you understand. The coloring of the towers is top-notch.

The agenda of the virtual meeting included a discussion of issues of trilateral cooperation. Many encouraging words were said about the achievements in the field of economic cooperation, as well as regional security. Aggressive actions on the part of the PRC in the South China Sea were also noted. ➖➖➖➖➖➖However, at the moment the prospects for this format are relatively vague. The main reason is the change in the White House administration.➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Biden, of course, expressed the hope that Donald Trump will continue the course towards trilateral rapprochement. And many observers express similar opinions. But so far there have been no hints from Trump about the course he will pursue regarding the Philippines and the country's support in the South China Sea. Not everything is going smoothly with Japan either. Thus, the military treaty recently concluded between the Filipinos and the Japanese has not yet been ratified by the Japanese parliament. 📌It can be assumed that the Japanese administration is deliberately delaying ratification so as not to interfere with efforts to interact with China. Relations between the two countries are now actively developing, as we have already mentioned several times. Therefore, it is not yet entirely clear what will happen with the trilateral format. Perhaps the factors listed are only temporary difficulties. However, we will be able to get an exact answer only after Trump takes office and further monitors the prospects for Japanese-Chinese relations.#USA #Philippines #Japan @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usINQUIRER.NETMarcos, Biden, Ishiba pledge stronger trilateral ties in phone callMANILA, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., US President Joe Biden, and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Monday committed to further strengthening trilateral ties across various areas of cooperation.	https://t.me/rybar/67139	2025-01-14T00:53:32-08:00

Forwarded From Severyanochka🇪🇺 Today in Helsinki, NATO leaders will gather for a summit to discuss measures to combat the Russian shadow fleet in the Baltic. The meeting will be attended by the presidents and prime ministers of Finland, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Denmark and Sweden, as well as German Chancellor and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. 🔺 At the end of the day, the public will be presented with a joint statement on NATO’s response to acts of destruction of underwater infrastructure. According to Finnish journalist Maria Stenroos, the alliance is developing a hybrid strategy to contain Russia in the Baltic, and the measures mentioned will include the use of new surveillance technologies, as well as changes in the interpretation of laws that will allow the detention of ships carrying Russian oil. ▪️The use of a new shipping monitoring system with AI elements has already been announced by the UK, which launched Operation Nordic Warden in the Baltic Sea to track ships belonging to the Russian shadow fleet. ▪️As for changes in the interpretation of laws, no clarifications have been given yet. Previously, the Finnish media called the armed seizure of the merchant ship -Eagle S-, committed in the international waters of the Gulf of Finland, a precedent. I would like to be wrong, but I believe that we can expect some reservations in the interpretation of international maritime law designed to legitimize this act and subsequent ones. One way or another, any such reservations that may be accepted by countries in the region in relation to international law will be illegal and pose a threat that will lead to a serious escalation of the situation in the Baltic Sea. ❗️What we are now seeing in the Baltic essentially means the transition of Western countries from sanctions to military measures: NATO ships have already begun patrolling, the tracking system has been deployed - all that remains is to legitimize subsequent actions. #NATO #Russia #shadow_fleetSeveryanochkaTelegramSeveryanochka🇬🇧🇷🇺 Some details of the previously announced expansion of NATO presence in the Baltic Sea have become known. 🔺 According to the Finnish broadcasting company Yle, by the end of this week up to 10 alliance warships will be deployed in the Baltic, which...	https://t.me/rybar/67138	2025-01-13T23:54:02-08:00

Alas, the situation has not changed radically, and three years later, fighters mainly receive cars from volunteers, or even buy them themselves. Moreover, consumable components are needed for cars purchased with their own money. Mechanics have to spend their salaries on them - often the funds received from humanitarian aid workers are not included in the supply of the army.📌 Sometimes, as a counterargument to solving the problem, they name the price, they say it is expensive to give each platoon an SUV. And somehow the fact is omitted that this is still cheaper than paying millions for the deaths of those who could not be evacuated or rotated due to the lack of suitable vehicles. Since we were unable / did not want to create a front-line vehicle, in terms of mass numbers and reliability superior to -Loaf-, then you can go a different way. Now, after all, there is a campaign underway to transfer vehicles to military license plates as part of restoring order.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️So why not, at the same time, accept the same L200 and Pajero for supply? There will be a compromise: some will be satisfied with -black license plates-, others will be able to officially receive consumables and even officially purchase such vehicles for the troops.➖➖➖➖➖➖But for now, some kind of unilateral restoration of order is coming out: if you really want to -legalize- vehicles from humanitarian workers , then isn’t it worth going to the end in this matter with a consistent focus on both balance and supply? #AFRF #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramWitnesses of BayraktarWhat kind of car is needed at the front?

The hits occurred both at ammunition depots of the Lebanese group in the southern part of the country and at facilities on the border with Syria. According to a statement by the IDF press service, the reason for the attack was the inaction of the Lebanese army, which the Israelis had previously informed about the discovery of attempts by Hezbollah fighters to accumulate ammunition and use the border infrastructure to smuggle weapons. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Nevertheless, with the coming to power in Syria of supporters of the terrorist organization Hayat Tahrir al-Shamlivan group, it lost land transit from Iran through Syrian territory. And on the border itself, the tense situation has remained in recent days amid clashes between progressive jihadists and the Lebanese. ➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️In the meantime, Israel still has less than two weeks left before, according to a previously signed agreement with Hezbollah, it will be necessary to withdraw the units located there from southern Lebanon.

In a similar way, 107 mm were spotted in the Russian Armed Forces Koksan self-propelled artillery mounts, and even earlier — self-propelled long-range ATGM Bulsae-4 controlled via a fiber-optic cable. As we wrote earlier, you shouldn’t expect any very impressive performance characteristics from the samples of the gloomy Korean genius - there is no such wunderwaffe either in the DPRK, much less in the so-called Iran .➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️However, each such sample adds fire power - for the same reason, the RF Armed Forces do not hesitate to use old T-55s as -mobile artillery-.

Forwarded From Awakening Dragon 🐲🇰🇵🇷🇺🇺🇦 Recently, the first alleged video evidence has appeared that North Korean soldiers are participating in the Ukrainian conflict. In the video, two soldiers from the DPRK who were captured in the Kursk region are interrogated. Colleagues from Rybar write that from such a limited number of phrases spoken by the prisoners, it is difficult to understand whether these are really North Korean servicemen. And this is true. However, there is still something to complain about.🔻For example, during the interrogation, the translator asks the first prisoner if he wants to return to North Korea. He asks this question twice - first he uses the word 북한 (bukhan) and then the word 조선 (joseon). And only the second time he receives an answer. It is important to understand here that in South Korea a neighbor is called -pukhan-. The North Koreans themselves call their country Choson. The fact that the prisoner responded only for the second time may prove that he is indeed a citizen of the DPRK. ▪️When asking a question to another prisoner, the translator uses only the word -pukhan-. And he immediately receives an answer. Taking this into account, one could immediately accuse the Ukrainians of lying, however, there is a -but-. As can be seen from the previous photos and videos, the interrogated people are together in the same cell. The second prisoner most likely figured out from the previous questions addressed to the first what they wanted from him. So understanding where they come from is really challenging. ❗️By the way, about the Korean voiceover. Don’t think that the Ukrainians hired a translator - South Korean media write that the Southern National Intelligence Service sent a representative to Ukraine. The dispatch of an intelligence translator is a continuation of last year’s story, when the Seoul authorities’ plans to send a group to Ukraine to interrogate North Korean prisoners of war were leaked to the media. It is unknown whether they were fully implemented. However, after the appearance of this video, we can definitely say that the Ukrainians and South Koreans have begun cooperation in this area.

Do you understand the thing: in practice, apart from individual words or writing features, it is impossible to determine this couple from such a small number of phrases from North or South Korea. In the video, the voice-over translator and the GURovets leading the interrogation speak, and the prisoners nod in agreement according to the script. ➖➖➖➖➖➖However, it is difficult to expect any other behavior from prisoners of war on both sides of the front. There are very few who persevere to the end. Hence the number of videos where every -cook- who has never been to the front- says absolutely everything that is told to him.➖➖➖➖➖➖The emphasis on the video is purely Korean, some phrases that are not memorized non-native speakers. Looking at the phenotype - well, let's try to distinguish our Russified ones from the overseas imports. For Russia this is another task. In fact, given the huge number of foreigners in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, jumping around every Korean and looking for evidence of the supply of soldiers from the DPRK in commercial quantities is a so-so story.

Forwarded From Balkan Gossip Girl Meanwhile, Russian resources are discussing the New Year’s interview with the Chief of the Serbian General Staff to the authoritative publication Vecernja Novosti. General Mojsilović honestly spoke about the current state of Russian-Serbian military-technical cooperation, which is in... a very difficult situation. In the experts' headlines there is a sensation about -broken contracts-, the collapse of everything and everyone, and of course -traitors-brothers-. At the same time, Mr. Moisilovich did not say anything new (at all) in his interview. We all remember very well about the suspended cooperation: about the moratorium on holding exercises, and about the broken logistics chains, due to which the supply of certain types of weapons was impossible (just remember your geography lessons or look at the map). Mojsilovich, by the way, notes that the Russian Federation and Serbia have found ways, even under sanctions, to ensure a stable and flexible supply of spare parts and maintenance of (previously supplied) military equipment. Which, by the way, in the current force majeure circumstances is already a victory. In general, why everyone was suddenly so ostentatiously surprised in some media outlets, and why they started hype again on an already sad topic, I don’t understand. @balkanossiper - we have been setting world trends since June 28, 1914	https://t.me/rybar/67104	2025-01-12T10:28:31-08:00

At the end of 2023, we saw how the Dicastery of the Doctrine of the Faith actually approved the introduction of LGBT people to the Christian sacraments - namely baptism.

In the last two weeks, the resistance of Ukrainian formations in the area has weakened significantly, which has made it possible to occupy most of the urban development, reaching the industrial zone on the northern and northeastern outskirts of the city.❗️In the 12th microdistrict, soldiers of the 4th company of the 3rd rifle battalion of the 109th separate rifle regiment hoisted the unit's flag on the waste heap of mine No. 10, confirming the stable control of the Russian Armed Forces over nearby surroundings. To the north of the waste heap, attack aircraft are gradually approaching the waste heap of mine No. 12 and the industrial site of the St. Matrona of Moscow mine.▪️In the Fomikha microdistrict, Russian units were spotted on Volynskaya Street not far from the waste heap of the same name. It is unknown whether the fighters managed to establish control over the prevailing height, just as the status of the Toretskaya mine, fighting on the outskirts of which has been going on for the last few weeks, remains unclear. With its capture, it will be possible to state the almost complete liberation of Dzerzhinsk.

Forwarded From Severyanochka🇷🇺🏴🇺🇦 The Supreme Court added the movement - Forum of Free Peoples of Post-Russia - and all its structural divisions to the list of terrorist organizations. Including the virtual Pomeranian movement -Bjarmiya-, which advocates the separation of the territory of the Arkhangelsk region from the Russian Federation.▪️The leader of the movement is the former bass guitarist of the Arkhangelsk punk rock band -Kablam- Mikhail Gradov.🔺The musical creativity of the guys at one time attracted the attention of the Center’s specialists -E- Ministry of Internal Affairs. It is possible that the future Pomeranian terrorist had connections with Mikhail Zhlobitsky, a 17-year-old anarchist who blew himself up in the building of the regional FSB headquarters in 2018. Be that as it may, Gradov decided to breathe more freely and move to Estonia, where for some time he worked in low-skilled labor and was treated for anxiety disorder (GAD) ... with various substances. In the fall of 2022, with the announcement of partial mobilization in Russia to the Ukrainian special services , as you know, I urgently needed free hands. And Mikhail (not otherwise than through an advertisement) found himself an ideal part-time job remotely - searching for and recruiting arsonists of military registration and enlistment offices in Russia. And already in February 2023, a new ambitious project awaited him - to lead the Forum... - the movement of Pomeranian separatists... Or at least create the appearance of their presence. 🔺 At first, Mikhail actively tried to encourage Arkhangelsk residents to join the ranks of -partisans-: set fires, collect information about law enforcement officers, arm themselves with drones to fight the regime and beat cars with -ZOV- symbols. But very soon, Ukrainian curators stopped allocating a budget for this business, since the idea showed its inconsistency and futility. The movement remained purely virtual.🔺So - Pomeranian separatism - survived its second incarnation in the history of modern Russia (apparently, having finally buried this phenomenon). This time the beneficiaries were Ukrainian curators. In the past period (2000s and 2010s), the main beneficiaries and ideologists of the movement were Norway and the United States. But Severyanochka will talk about this some other time. #separatism #Russia #UkraineSeveryanochka	https://t.me/rybar/67096	2025-01-12T00:21:07-08:00

With Donald Trump taking office as President of the United States, the prospects for the queer community and sponsors of the transgender madness that has gripped the planet in the last four years are not looking very rosy. Trump has threatened to shut down all programs that promote gender transition. The Republican election campaign was based, among other things, on promises to return traditional values ​​and the nuclear family to America. Obviously, the United States itself decided to slow down social experiments and roll back some of the particularly unpopular decisions - until better times-.

Forwarded From Two Majors#Review #Report for the morning of January 12, 2025▪️ The past week and the meeting of NATO defense ministers in the Ramstein format clearly showed that it is too early to talk about an actual reduction in the level of military-technical assistance to Ukraine. In the last days of Biden’s tenure, the United States also intensively allocated funds to support the Armed Forces of Ukraine, trying to create conditions for prolonging Kyiv’s actions to deplete Russia’s military and economic resources. Zelensky, trying to please different forces, simultaneously declared the need to achieve peace in 2025 and sent attack UAVs to strike Russian energy facilities.▪️ The Armed Forces of Ukraine at the front, despite maintaining combat stability and the ability to conduct organized defensive battles, are increasingly faced with the problem of shortages personnel and the low level of moral and psychological state of their forcibly mobilized troops. This is evidenced by the multiple increase in the number of criminal cases initiated for SOC, massive interdepartmental raids on the organizers of evasion in the service in Ukraine, scandals with desertion of the Armed Forces of Ukraine trained abroad.▪️ However, it is too early to talk about the collapse of the Armed Forces of Ukraine at the front, despite the preservation of the Russian Army initiatives throughout its entire length.▪️ Thus, in the Kursk region, the enemy is conducting intensive counter actions with the aim of slowing our progress in the region. The Russian Armed Forces, in heavy bloody battles, advanced to the northern ledge near Pogrebki and Novaya Sorochina, Kruglenkoe, Malaya Loknya, advance south from Russian Porechny, and break their way to Sudzha along the shortest route through Makhnovka. At the same time, the enemy maintains a large group in the Sumy region, from which it transfers reserves to the LBS and tries to localize our advance. On the ground, our troops are preparing for another politically motivated attack by the enemy in the last days before Trump takes office.▪️ Control of the Russian Armed Forces on the right bank of the river is gradually expanding. Oskol north of Kupyansk in Dvurechnaya. In Chasov Yar, battles are taking place around the fireproof plant, and enemy approaches to the facility are being blocked. The most difficult assault on Toretsk (Dzerzhinsk) is nearing completion, but the enemy stubbornly clings to the remaining positions. Pokrovsk (Krasnoarmeysk) The Russian Army is trying to deprive supply routes from the southwest; to the east of the city, the Russian Armed Forces were moving towards the highway to Konstantinovka. After the liberation of Kurakhovo, our troops create conditions for closing the pocket south of the city, and the offensive and liberation of villages continue in the north-west. The position of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Velikaya (Bolshaya) Novosyolka is worsening, the enemy garrison is holding defenses on the approaches to the village, the Russian Armed Forces are having tactical successes and are consolidating in the positions they have achieved. The Zaporozhye Front and the Kherson direction are without significant changes, the situation is characterized by mutual strikes by the parties on each other’s positions.▪️ In the Black Sea, more and more data is being received about the expansion of the range of enemy MBECs, which have gone from -kamikaze boats- to various platforms with guides for MLRS, machine gun turrets, air defense systems and launch containers for attack FPV drones. The development by the enemy of a whole range of such naval drones, which, as part of a battle formation, solve various tasks on the water, is a new challenge for the Russian Navy and requires the speedy adoption of systemic new decisions, because the enemy has found effective means to combat our countermeasures.▪️ The coming week will be the last before Trump's inauguration. It is not without reason that our military command expects politically motivated actions by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, only on a larger scale than what happened on January 5-6 in the Kursk region. The transformation of statements by Trump and his team about plans to help resolve the conflict is indicative: from a day to 100 days/six months. At the same time, if the United States completely controls all decisions in Kyiv, then Washington has virtually no leverage over Moscow.

🔁🖼 🇺🇦 About the corps structure of the Armed Forces of Ukrain...	Forwarded From Globalistics🇺🇦 About the corps structure of the Armed Forces of UkraineUsing materials from colleagues, the Z Committee and the ZVI Search Engine, summarized all available information about the new corps system of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the reforms of which were written in MilitaryMaps.♦️The point is: in addition to various reforms like tax cuts for military-industrial complex enterprises, recruitment through recruiting, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have finally reached the finalized corps system. In 2023, before the counter-offensive, the enemy created two army corps - 9 and 10. Then they included an average of 5 brigades, and they were a strike force that was confused in attempts to advance in the Zaporozhye direction. In addition to them, there was a reserve corps, where the basis was supposed to become the 5th Brigade, but it didn’t work out. She was torn to pieces, which later became commonplace. Now in the new reform there is even a ban on such practice.❗️So, the corps.▪️9 AK now, judging by information from open sources, consists of three brigades: 33 and 47 Mechanized Brigades, as well as 3 Specialized Brigades.▪️10 AK - also of three connections. 116 and 118 Mechanized Infantry Brigades and the recently reformed 117th Mechanized Infantry Brigade.▪️11 AK is still the most numerous. There are ten brigades in it. This is due to the fact that it was a reserve corps previously, and all brigades that were sent to full strength were assigned to it.▪️12 AK is a new corps. There is not even information about who will enter it. And it seems that some of the compounds 11 AK will become part of it. This will be logical for the operational recruitment of 12 AK.❗️In addition to this, there is the 30th Marine Corps. Its composition has also recently undergone changes. The 150th Mechanized Infantry Brigade became the 40th separate coastal defense brigade (OBrBO). In addition, it has 39 OBrBO, which will most likely be created on the basis of 124 OBr TerO. The 7th Corps of the DShV includes all airmobile and air assault units. Almost all of them are fighting in various sectors, which is why they have a huge turnover.♦️In general, the structure of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has changed radically. If we evaluate it in terms of combat capabilities, the most important improvement is the creation of separate control lines that are independent of each other. That is, each corps, or rather the command, can make decisions independently. This simplifies both replenishment, manning, and combat operations, since they are not waiting for a decision from Kyiv. In conflicts of such intensity, this is a key factor. Individual battalions of UAVs and BECs deserve special attention. Priority acquisition, large funding and PR are important changes in the context of the growing importance of these weapons. #Ukraine Globalistics - subscribe to the channel	https://t.me/rybar/67083	2025-01-11T06:11:02-08:00

President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said that it is necessary to -accelerate- with the construction of nuclear power plants, and also repeated his recent thesis about the need to -build two large plants, possibly three. Three nuclear power plants were discussed even before the referendum: the head of the Ministry of Energy of the Republic of Kazakhstan Almasadam Satkaliev voiced this need and even named possible sites. Nuclear power plants are convenient for the Republic of Kazakhstan because they can close the generation gap, without undermining declarations of striving for carbon neutrality. ➖➖➖➖➖➖One can even assume that the authorities initially considered such a scenario, but decided not to escalate the situation right off the bat and first achieve the population’s consent in principle for construction. In this case, the construction of one or more nuclear power plants would become a technical issue. At the same time, it seems that Astana has already resolved the issue with the contractor. And then Tokayev’s statement is a sweetened pill for those counterparties who were left without a contract. It is no coincidence that the president mentioned in his interview (in this order): Rosatom, Chinese companies and Western ones, thus setting priorities. #Kazakhstan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usKazakhstan's main news - Tengrinews.kzAn extensive interview with President Tokayev has been published.

At the same time, the number of deaths in the region has already exceeded 46 thousand people, about 109 thousand were injured. At the same time, the Israeli ground operation continued in the city of Jabaliya, located north of Gaza. After two months of fighting, the 900th infantry brigade -Kfir- was withdrawn from there.▪️Nevertheless, the Palestinians did not lose the opportunity to strike at Israeli territory. During the launches in Sderot, one of the missiles fell on the roof of a house, the second in an open area, and the third was intercepted. ▪️In the center of the Gaza Strip, Israeli troops continued to strike Nuseirat and other cities. In response, Palestinian forces daily fired at Israeli positions at the Netzarim intersection and in Juhr ad-Dik.▪️In the south, Israeli troops carried out engineering work in the Philadelphia Corridor. Against this background, the bodies of several Arab citizens of Israel, abducted by Hamas militants, were discovered in Rafah.▪️Police raids by Israeli security forces continued in the West Bank. So, starting from October 7, 2023, more than 12,200 Palestinians were detained.▪️One of the raids took place in Tammun in Tubas province, where the Israelis used unmanned aircraft.

Against the backdrop of urgent collections for the needs of the units, the requests of the Rybar team to neglect a cup of coffee and donate the conditional 150 rubles for Russian analytics look ridiculous from the point of view of many. Many do not understand why support an information project at all, because it is of no use. There is a point: we concentrate on covering the actions of the enemy, which increases the awareness of our troops (by helping us, you are helping them with information). We tell our bureaucrats what is happening in distant countries so that they can make informed decisions. We fight off information attacks and show what is really happening.

Large-scale deployment of a response force led by the NATO Rapid Deployment Corps and supported by 10 allies. NATO will conduct a large-scale exercise called Steadfast Dart in Romania, Bulgaria and Greece from 13 January to 26 February. The purpose of the exercise: the first large-scale deployment of the NATO Rapid Reaction Force (ARF) ). Their purpose is to test the capabilities of rapid deployment, as well as the interaction between participating and host countries. The ARF is a strategic, highly mobile, multi-role force. It brings together multi-role forces from across the Alliance to achieve objectives in a shorter time frame than previously possible. The exercise will demonstrate NATO's ability to quickly deploy forces to strengthen its eastern flank. The transfer of reinforcements will take place during a simulation of a conflict with an enemy of almost equal strength. It must demonstrate the ability of NATO's response force to conduct complex combat operations in a theater spanning thousands of kilometers under any conditions,- NATO said in a statement. Although the exercises are taking place in southern Europe, the Alliance emphasizes that the main goal of these maneuvers is to improve operations near Russian borders. The exercises will involve 10 thousand military personnel, various types of troops, including ground forces, navy, aviation and special forces units . 🇬🇧Great Britain will be one of the largest participants in the exercises, sending 2.6 thousand military personnel and 730 units of equipment.✨It would seem that 10 thousand military personnel is not so much. However, NATO exercise standards test the ability to quickly deploy a contingent hosting the main force. That is, it is not entire formations from different countries that are participating, but the main backbone, which NATO members are able to quickly build up with meat. It is important that during the maneuvers the ability of logistics on the eastern flank of the Alliance is tested (and they are improving logistics very actively after the start of the Northern Military District). In general, all this is called military preparations, which European countries are doing more and more diligently. Two majors	https://t.me/rybar/67067	2025-01-10T12:49:02-08:00

After all, Denmark donated the lion's share of its ground equipment to the so-called. Ukraine. For the sake of objectivity, even without this, the local armed forces would still not be able to resist the United States. But what is important here is the fact that free military assistance from the Ukrainian Armed Forces left the country unarmed, essentially eliminating the ability to resist. 📌 And we can remember about the larger EU countries, which are emptying their arsenals in the same way. For example, Germany, whose authorities, in response to insults from representatives of the Kyiv regime, continue to give it even scarce weapons. The EU strategy for military supply is the so-called. Ukraine is based on the fact that there can be no threat within the bloc, and the United States will protect it from the rest.

And to train anyone capable of holding a weapon, they should be sent to training grounds in Europe.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️The statement contains an attitude towards the so-called. Ukraine from sponsors - kill Russia with your entire country and population, and we will help you with this and will even root for you.➖➖➖➖➖➖True, in his discussions about total mobilization, Wallace omits the fact that not everyone is busified - can become a combat unit. The clearest example is the 155th mechanized brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, formed in France, where a third of its personnel deserted. However, taking into account the fact that lowering the conscription age is a condition for the continuation of military assistance to the so-called. Ukraine, a decision on this is not far off.

At the end of December last year, the Japanese government, led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, approved the country's new defense budget, which is already a record for the 13th time. They are going to allocate about $55 billion for security needs. 📌The money will go to various items of expenses. These include the development and production of domestic long-range missiles for counterattacking enemy military targets. In addition, finances will be spent on creating a satellite constellation necessary for detecting targets and monitoring them. It seems it's no coincidence that a unit of the US Space Force was stationed in Japan last year. 🔻Approximately three billion has been allocated to improve the conditions of service of the Japanese military. This also includes an increase in salary. Such expenses are necessary because in Japan there is a certain shortage of personnel in the Self-Defense Forces. Here, by the way, it is worth considering that the approval of the budget by Ishiba’s cabinet does not mean that it will be adopted in the country’s parliament. According to the results of last year's elections, the ruling party lost its majority in the legislative body, which means the opposition can still put a spoke in the wheels of the government. We will be able to find out the final defense spending later this year. #Japan@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usKyodo News+Japan defense budget hits record 8.7 tril. yen amid regional threatsJapan's defense budget grew to a record 8.70 trillion yen ($55 billion) for fiscal 2025, the government says, as the country continues to enhance its capabilities to address regional threats amid China's rapid military buildup and North Korea's growing ties…	https://t.me/rybar/67042	2025-01-10T00:29:01-08:00

The capital of the Palestinian enclave, Nuseirat, and the surrounding area of ​​Khan Yunis came under the most concentrated fire. At the same time, IDF operations continue in the north of the enclave, where this time Palestinian forces were active: they carried out successful ambushes in Beit Lahia and Jabaliya, killing at least three Israelis. In the West Bank, Israeli security forces conducted a series of raids in more than ten settlements: over the past two days, more than 60 local residents were detained. The largest clashes occurred in Jenin and Tulkarm. On the Lebanese-Israeli border, the situation has not undergone significant changes: the Israelis periodically strike at identified targets in the south of Lebanon, while fighters from the Arab Republic are gradually entering some settlements. 🔻A detailed analytical report on events in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_bot High resolution map English version⭐️ Online maps are available by subscription to map.rybar.ru#digest #report #map #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67031	2025-01-09T10:45:00-08:00

Over the past two weeks, the front section has clearly revived, Russian troops have advanced to the western border of the LPR. Thanks to footage from Makeyevka, it was possible to establish that fighters of the Russian Armed Forces expanded the zone of control, clearing several forest belts on the right bank of the Zherebets River. To the south, work is underway to eliminate the bridgehead of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the vicinity of the recently liberated Ivanovka, but information about the breakthrough of the defense of the Armed Forces in the direction of Kolodezy cannot yet be confirmed. The development of the success of the Russian Armed Forces in the direction of Yampolovka and Torskoye will make it possible to free the entire left bank from the presence of the enemy and begin the assault on Zarechny, from where the road to Liman opens.

🇦🇿🇦🇲 Aliyev is creating reasons for a new war against Armenia...	🇦🇿🇦🇲 Aliyev creates reasons for a new war against Armenia. The New Year in Baku begins with yet another claims against Yerevan. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said that Armenia is a threat to the South Caucasus. Aliyev demanded that France and other countries stop arming Armenia: break military contracts and return the supplied weapons. Another condition is the opening of the so-called. Zangezur corridor through the south of Armenia, which will connect Azerbaijan and Turkey. To the stated conditions, Aliyev added changes to the Constitution of Armenia and the abolition of the OSCE Minsk Group on the settlement of the Karabakh conflict. 📌As we wrote, the peace process between Azerbaijan and Armenia has predictably reached a dead end, despite the demonstrative optimism promoted by the now retiring US presidential administration. The deadlock in the situation lies in the fact that Yerevan is already making concessions, including on amending the Constitution. Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan even spoke about his readiness to open a message via the so-called. Zangezur corridor, but with respect for the sovereign rights of Armenia. 🔻Since Baku still accuses Armenia of sabotaging the opening of communications in the south, the main claim of the Azerbaijanis is aimed at the sovereign rights of Armenians to their territory. To achieve this, the Azerbaijani media are promoting the image of an -aggressive- and -revanchist- Armenia, which does not correspond to reality. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️All this once again suggests that Azerbaijan is creating a reason for another military aggression, which may happen in the near future and its target will be the Syunik region. The state of the Armenian Armed Forces raises big questions: French and Indian-made weapons do not create offensive potential and it is unclear to what extent they can even provide defense. #Azerbaijan #Armenia @rybarSupport usInterfaxAliyev called Armenia a source of threat to the South CaucasusPresident of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev said that Armenia is a source of threat to the South Caucasus.	https://t.me/rybar/67023	2025-01-09T05:21:31-08:00
🇹🇩🖇 What happened in Chad? On the evening of January 8, multip...	🇹🇩🖇 What happened in Chad? On the evening of January 8, multiple sources reported shootings near the Presidential Palace in N'Djamena, the capital of Chad. There were different rumors about the incident - from a coup attempt to an attack by almost defeated Boko Haram terrorists. The latter story was even initially supported by the Chadian authorities, to whom political strategists proposed to hush up the incident in this way. Later, officials confirmed that the attackers did not belong to terrorist groups. It was especially noted that they did not have firearms, and they got to the Palace by public transport.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖❓So what really happened? The incident turned out to be an ordinary skirmish between representatives of tribes who met - not in that place... There has long been a saying among Chadians that you should not look at the president for more than half a minute, and in this case they started a fight right in the center of the capital. To separate them, the police and the Palace guards opened warning fire, which is why some participants in the brawl attacked them . During the clash, according to media reports, 18 attackers and 1 policeman were killed. The real number of victims is somewhat lower.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️But the main thing in this story is the reaction of the French media. The largest media agencies AFP and RFI reported the shooting in N'Djamena half an hour after the incident and cited rumors of a coup attempt or terrorist attack .And this is due to the fact that on the same day the first group flew from N’Djamena to the mainland French military personnel, which was a reputational blow for France. In addition, in the morning Debi the Younger received the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Thus, the Western media inflated the molehill out of a molehill and turned a domestic skirmish almost into a military coup against the anti-French president . Most likely, they planned to increase the degree of escalation and try to ignite a civil conflict, but, as we see, this was not possible.#Africa #Chad #France #mediatechnology@rybarSupport usBurkina24.com - Actualité du Burkina Faso 24h/24Tentative de déstabilization au Tchad : La version des faits du gouvernement qui évoque 18 morts côté assaillants et un mort du...Actualité - Tentative de déstabilization au Tchad : La version des faits du gouvernement qui évoque 18 morts côté assaillants et un mort du côté des gardes de sécurité présidentielle	https://t.me/rybar/67021	2025-01-09T03:23:01-08:00
🔁🖼 🇬🇧 Britain is creating new stealth boats to attack Russia ...	Forwarded From Two Majors🇬🇧 Britain is creating new low-profile boats to attack Russia from the sea. On January 22, the UK Ministry of Defense will hold a conference in London on the new COOKSON project to develop a universal, fast and stealth maritime system intended for operations in Ukraine. The project involves the creation of a small fast attack boat equipped with a modular payload and capable of operating in difficult conditions. Options for boats and completely without a crew are being considered. The Ministry outlined the desired characteristics of COOKSON:▪️Maximum speed: from 40 knots▪️Range: 800 nautical miles with a full load▪️Autonomy: at least 72 hours▪️Unobtrusive silhouette▪️High noise immunity▪️Ability to carry several weapon modules with a range at once 30-100 km.▪️Availability of air defense systems The system should be able to quickly be supplied to Ukraine by land on a trailer about 6-12 meters long. Each long-range weapon will carry an 80-kilogram high-explosive warhead. The primary targets are unprotected land areas, the secondary targets are surface ships. The project requirements include scalability and production time with a target of 2-3 ships in the first months with 20 weapon modules. The UK plans to begin purchasing the first 10 COOKSON systems, along with hundreds of weapon modules, in the first quarter of 2025.✨ It is noteworthy that such systems are being directly prepared specifically for British missions in the Black Sea under the guise of Ukrainian activity. They act systematically: first they test the MBECs, making the operation of the fleet of large warships as difficult as possible, then they modernize the MBECs in order to reduce the efficiency of our aviation. Now we have moved on to the next stage - they will try to attack from the sea the coastal strip and objects in the rear, where the air defense density is traditionally lower. An important requirement for the system is the ability to send mission information remotely, and target detection, identification and planning can be performed by third parties.

🇷🇺🇸🇾🏴 Again about the issues of the Russian presence in Syri...	🇷🇺🇸🇾🏴 Again about the issues of the Russian presence in Syria. Here, the next questions have surfaced regarding the presence of the Russian contingent in -New Syria-: for several days now, the cargo ship -Sparta- has not been able to enter the port of Tartus, where the 720th point is located materially - technical support (720 PMTO) of the Russian Navy. Now the Russian ship is standing on external roadstead in the Mediterranean, awaiting further decisions. The official reason for the delay has not yet been named; different versions are being considered - from internal logistics and technical problems to the refusal of the new authorities to provide permission to enter the port.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻The second option is most likely. The country is now headed by functionaries of the terrorist organization Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and structures loyal to it. Of course, relations with those who were bombed by the Russian Aerospace Forces only yesterday will be strained, to put it mildly. The essence does not change - we face a new reality. There are no longer those with whom first the Soviet and then the Russian authorities signed agreements, according to which our troops were stationed at the Khmeimim airbase and in Tartus. There were no agreements on this issue with HTS or anyone else. However, new realities also arose for the militants of the new Syrian government. Now it will no longer be possible, as before, to play the role of -irreconcilable Mujahideen-, who under no circumstances collude with the enemy. This is no longer a small Idlib that can be given under the wing of Turkey. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 If yesterday’s moderate opposition could safely call Russia an occupier, today it is the presence of Russian naval and air bases that will allow balancing the political influence of friendly countries and internal competitors from among the most radical factions. And judging by the presence of the Russian embassies on the territory of the country, the absence of public diplomatic attacks on the Russian Federation and statements by the leader of HTS himself about the existence of strategic interests between the two countries, Damascus understands this fact. #Russia #Syria #terrorism@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67016	2025-01-08T23:01:01-08:00

Last night in the port of Koper, our subscribers from Slovenia captured the movement of a large convoy of weapons in the direction of the Slovenian capital Ljubljana. The footage recorded the movement of a convoy with the M109 self-propelled guns. It is difficult to reliably determine the modification in this video due to the darkness. In addition, the video is cut off, and it is not entirely clear how many self-propelled guns were on the trawls. In addition, it is unclear whether there was any other equipment besides the M109.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖❓In this regard, the question is brewing: where is the convoy moving from the Slovenian port? As a rule, deliveries are made through Slovenia and Greece to the so-called Ukraine through Hungary to Uzhgorod. Of course, this may be connected with some planned NATO exercise or rotation of military contingents in some Romania. However, recently the Ukrainian Armed Forces have been supplied with weapons and equipment. The offensive in the Kursk region does not yet look like the final chord. There was no major deployment of armored vehicles or large-scale missile strikes, so the enemy’s preparations are probably still ongoing.

Russian troops continue to knock out Ukrainian formations in several areas in the Kurakhovo direction.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Soldiers of the 114th mechanized brigade liberated Shevchenko, the unit’s flag was raised over the village . To the north, two large strongholds were partially occupied, but for now there remains a pocket with a Ukrainian presence between Petropavlovka and Shevchenko. ▪️There are successes in the Slavyanka area, located to the north. Forest belts to the east and northeast have been occupied, and control has been established over approximately half of the settlement. ▪️To the west of Kurakhovo, judging by messages on the Internet, battles for Dachnoye began yesterday. This is indirectly confirmed by footage of objective control by the enemy with strikes on Russian attack aircraft already on the western outskirts of the city directly on the administrative borders of Kurakhovo and Dachnoye.🔻To the south, Russian troops are advancing in the fields to the sludge sumps northeast of Yantarnoye. ▪️There were no attempts to enter Yantarnoye itself yesterday, but the situation is changing quite quickly.

In addition to radars and other equipment, it includes a surface unmanned boat. This mine protection BEC is manufactured by Textron. An AN/AQS-20C radar is installed on it to search for mines, as well as their subsequent non-contact destruction. -Santa Barbara- is the third frigate of this class to receive this module. In accordance with the plans of the American command, in 2025 and 2026 it is planned to send the first coastal zone ships to the Middle East with new crewless modules for testing them in the crisis zone.➖➖➖➖ ➖➖➖➖➖🔻A remarkable fact is that the company Textron has an active presence in the NWO area. According to our data, specialists from an American company supplied the Ukrainian Navy with parts, components and samples for assembling BECs. During the NVO, about a dozen different naval drones have already been spotted in the Black Sea. Some of them were assembled with the help of British engineers, and some by American ones. And this is not surprising, since the so-called Ukraine was a testing ground from the very beginning. Neither missiles, nor tanks, nor artillery, but UAVs and BECs are probably the key change in the framework of armed conflicts, which changes their character. Aircraft are used everywhere in all hot spots, and BECs are increasingly playing the role of ersatz MLRS/SAM/carrier of FPV drones.❗️The fact that the United States will move on to introducing these technologies into the combat fleet is a logical consequence that in the coming years we will observe in different countries. And it is important to understand that the USA or Britain were engaged in BECs even before the Northern Military District, but it was in the so-called Ukraine that they managed to test them in battle.#USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66998	2025-01-08T08:20:19-08:00

A video of Afrika Corps employees distributing food on the streets of the capital circulated on Niger’s social networks. The action was carried out on the initiative of military personnel. This was a simple gesture of politeness for those whom they came to visit and, of course, there was no malicious intent.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖📌It would seem that the soldiers did a good job and worked to create a positive image of the Russian soldier in a counterbalance to the eternal propaganda and accusations of war crimes. Moreover, the Russian Armed Forces are officially present here and such actions, even amateur ones, should be encouraged. However, everything turned out quite the opposite, local authorities expressed dissatisfaction with the incident, and the command eventually reprimanded the military personnel and forbade repeating such amateur activities.❓But why? Since the action was unplanned, no one thought to present it in the local media from the right angle. And when the video was picked up by French publications, there was no ready-made algorithm for working out the negative. So it turned out that the French and local African media, on salaries from Paris, promoted the version that the Russians humiliated the country’s population by distributing handouts to the lower strata of society. Western observers could not discern any other motive.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Because until we have created media resources (at least in the Sahel countries) capable of shaping the right attitude towards the Russian security forces, holding such actions is pointless. And after all The image of the military is just the tip of the iceberg. Literally every Russian business project (especially profitable and strategically important) will be attacked, even to the point of environmental protests (we remember when in South Africa, environmental activists actually disrupted the construction of a nuclear power plant from Rosatom) and will require anti-crisis measures. By the way, the same PMC - Wagner - understood this very well, therefore the development of its local (radio, newspaper and Internet media) media infrastructure in the country of presence was one of the most important areas. #Africa #Niger #Russia #mediatechnology @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66997	2025-01-08T07:29:58-08:00

🇬🇧 Results of 2024 for the UK Armed Forces and plans for the fu...	🇬🇧 Results of 2024 for the British Armed Forces and plans for the future Over the past year, news surrounding the British Army has often appeared on the pages of the media. Sometimes it even came to direct and far from groundless ridicule of the state of the armed forces, because enough reasons had accumulated: breaking down aircraft carriers, fires on nuclear submarines, lack of personnel and much more. Even the British military leadership openly discussed the presence of serious problems. Thus, Deputy Chief of the Defense Staff of the Armed Forces Rob McGowan, speaking before the relevant committee of the House of Commons, directly stated that there are risks when deploying the most combat-ready army unit. Of course, one of the goals of such publications is to escalate the situation around the armed forces in order to increase military spending and budget development, but problems do exist. They can be seen with the naked eye. How the British will correct the situation is not yet clear. So far, they decided to change the procurement system and tried to increase salaries in order to keep people in the army (it didn’t help much).🔻One way or another, the British over the past year have prepared the ground for increasing military spending. An increase in the defense budget is only a matter of time. But whether these financial funds will be used for the development of the armed forces or will end up in the right pockets is another topic. #Great Britain@rybar together with @oldGBR Support usTelegramRybar🇬🇧 To be honest, openly laughing at the combat capabilities of the British army is still somewhat reckless even despite all the objective problems with a shortage of personnel and a reduction in military production.

As a result of the attack, a large fire broke out on the territory of the oil depot; at least several fuel tanks are currently burning. Specialists from specialized services are working at the scene of the incident to eliminate the fire and other consequences of the raid. 🔻Only since the beginning of December, Ukrainian drones have attacked at least four facilities of the fuel and energy complex in Russia: in addition to the aforementioned Saratov region, oil depots in the Smolensk and Oryol regions, as well as the infrastructure of the Druzhba oil pipeline in the Bryansk region, came under fire. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Special attention should be paid to regularly appearing footage of the consequences of such raids, filmed by local residents. They not only actively relish various anti-Russian resources promoting all kinds of theses, but also allow the enemy to objectively evaluate the results of past attacks. On the same so-called In Ukraine, the fight against similar filming is being conducted at a much higher level: if at the beginning of the special operation the search for the consequences of Russian raids was reduced to simply viewing regional media, then over the past two years it has become much more difficult to find such information, and the appearance of the attack footage itself is, for the most part, exceptional character.

The United States and Denmark already have a 1951 treaty regarding agreements on military bases and strategic use of Greenland by the United States. 🔻Main provisions of the agreement:▪️The United States received the right to use the territories of Greenland to locate military bases;▪️The creation of an air force base at the Thule air base became the central point of the agreement;▪️The agreement provided for the use by American military forces of infrastructure on the territory of Greenland to ensure the security of the North Atlantic;▪️The United States took undertakes obligations to protect Greenland and its population from possible external threats. In fact, As you can see, the United States has the right to dispose of the territory of Greenland for the purpose of -ensuring the security- of the North Atlantic for as long as they want. Why would Trump include it in the United States? The American expert community does not take the words of the elected president seriously, believing that things will not come to the purchase of Greenland. However, it is possible that Trump increases the degree of tension in order to then retreat, but, for example, on the condition that Denmark pays for the construction of new bases or updating the infrastructure of old ones. @usaperiodical	https://t.me/rybar/66988	2025-01-08T01:01:30-08:00

Why does Trump threaten to seize Greenland from Denmark, the Panama Canal from Panama, and simply annex Canada?2. Why does Aliyev threaten to liquidate -Armenian fascism- together with Armenia and cut through one way or another a corridor to Nakhichevan?3. Why is Erdogan threatening to conduct his own SVO (-Special Wahhabi Operation-) in Syria against the Kurds?4. Why is Israel primitively seizing abandoned Syrian territories in southwestern Syria and continuing online genocide in the Gaza Strip?5. Why is the UAE actually annexing the Yemeni island of Socotra and pursuing a policy aimed at dismembering Yemen? Because international law has died and now the borders of countries are secured only and exclusively by force. Therefore, the strong will take from the weak what they can take. The UN in general and the UN Security Council in particular, like the vast majority of international institutions, are either completely or partially incompetent. This was led to by the processes of the dismemberment of Yugoslavia and the Kosovo precedent, which opened a Pandora's box, now wide open after the active introduction of the so-called rules-based order into current politics. This accelerated the growing understanding that generally applicable and binding rules as such simply do not exist. And since there are no rules, then relations between countries are increasingly determined by the ability to take -someone else's- and the ability to keep -what is theirs-. This is the natural ending of the late Washington world order and responsible American leadership. Therefore, in the coming years, the world we are familiar with in terms of territorial borders and spheres of influence will change. NWO in Ukraine is one of the important processes of changing the world order, but it is not the only one. A brave new world, where relations between countries and peoples will again (at least partially) be determined by the norms of international law, will come only after the coming series of wars and local conflicts that will accompanied by changes in state borders. As a result of these painful processes, a new world order will be formed, where new agreements will stake out the changes that we will observe. The old neoliberal globalism has collapsed, and capitalism itself is in the stage of imperialism; it cannot offer humanity anything other than a series of wars and transferred markets and spheres of influence. The task of the Russian Federation in these processes is to survive and succeed, including territorially, which must first of all contribute to the achievement of the goals of the Northern Military District, which will determine Russia’s place in the brave new multipolar world.	https://t.me/rybar/66987	2025-01-08T00:29:52-08:00

Probably for the first time we overtook them in technical progress. But don't delude yourself. They'll catch up with us soon. And then the issue of countering these drones will become increasingly acute, which, as usual, can and should be resolved retrospectively. Due to the fact that optical drones fly slower and make smoother maneuvers than radio drones, their main countermeasure will be the ever-memorable smoothbore guns. But. There are not enough of them at the front. Not so long ago, the news was thundering from every source, including from the deputy governor, that the Russian Guard would now flood the front with confiscated goods. But there is no special news about this collapse yet. After all, the announced figure of 250k is essentially one gun for 3-4 people. Do you have such security, and the fighters? Was the issue with guns really the same as with the confiscated boats on the Dnieper (and other confiscated property)? Remember, this initiative was raised a year and a half ago. The officials valiantly took it up, saying that now we will fill the Dnieper with boats. Some people really supported it from their regions. But it turned out to be more populism. Just like with a smoothbore. We urgently need to get rid of populism and flood the front with guns and ammunition. Otherwise, the fighters will have to run around the landings with scissors, cutting off the optics. Revenge of good will	https://t.me/rybar/66981	2025-01-08T00:13:20-08:00
🇨🇦 Why Trudeau will leave the post of Prime Minister of Canada ...	🇨🇦 Why Trudeau will leave the post of Prime Minister of Canada with a sense of accomplishment On Monday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his intention to leave the post of Prime Minister and head of the Liberal Party. The work of parliament was suspended until March 24 until the party chose a new leader. We expected this development of events. At the end of December, the Liberal minority lost the support of the New Democrats: party leader Jagmeet Singh proposed joining forces with the Conservatives in nominating Trudeau for a vote of no confidence. 🔻Despite the shameful end of his prime minister's term, it is worth noting that in 9 years at the head of the government, Trudeau did a lot to turn Canada into a globalist paradise on Earth. Under him, euthanasia was legalized, carbon taxes were introduced, millions of migrants were brought into the country (this ensured record population growth) and billions of dollars were allocated so-called. Ukraine. Also, under his government, the LGBT agenda became widespread, and hard drugs were legalized in some provinces. In essence, Trudeau has done everything possible to promote liberal ideas, and now, as waste material, he can safely leave the main stage. And Canadians are left with a legacy of economic, migration and housing crises, which more than one administration will have to sort out.🔻Who will take Trudeau’s place? Some people will see Chrystia Freeland, who resigned with scandal a few weeks ago, as the leader of the Liberal Party, or Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly. However, we would not be surprised if Mark Carney, the former head of the Bank of Canada, becomes the party leader. Carney's refusal to accept Trudeau's offer to become his finance minister was a natural reflection of higher ambitions. And with Carney at the helm, the Liberal Party will have a chance to win more seats in parliament in the elections that will take place later this year.#globalism #Canada@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇨🇦 About the political crisis in Canada and Trudeau’s possible resignationThe Liberal government of Canada experienced a serious shake-up on the eve of the Christmas holidays Two ministers left their posts at once: Chrystia Freeland - Minister of Finance, Deputy Prime Minister...	https://t.me/rybar/66980	2025-01-07T23:25:38-08:00

Forwarded From mate money two barrels Dear subscribers, we have come across a recent decree of the Ministry of Education (if you can even call it that) of Syria on making changes to the school curriculum. At first glance, nothing -specific: a ban on mentioning the Baath party and one characteristic surname. However, if you look deeper, this is a complete radicalization of Islamization of inclusive education: 1. In school textbooks, the interpretation of the term -righteous path- (الصراط المستقيم) is changing. If earlier it meant the -path of good- (طريق الخير), now it means -the path of Islam- (طريق الإسلام)2. All images and descriptions of the ancient gods Melqart and Marduk, who are in one way or another part of the cultural heritage of Syria, have been removed from high school history textbooks, which essentially leads to the erasure of the memory of cultural identity. Why? Because Islamization is radicalization.3. In principle, the word -gods- and -deities- is being removed from history textbooks; no replacement for the term is proposed. 4. Religious language is inserted even into purely secular phrases. For example, in a law textbook, the phrase -He was tried by a fair law- was changed to -Allah was his judge.- And yes, the photographs are not of the famous film about Tabulistan, but of a Syrian secondary school a couple of years later. React if you watched this masterpiece.	https://t.me/rybar/66977	2025-01-07T14:48:13-08:00

Forwarded From mate money two barrels People, we are with information from former Syrian mukhabaratchiks regarding what has been happening in Syria for the last month, which is of great importance in continuation of the posts about how Assad’s incompetent retinue and he himself brought the country to the fall. So , at the end of November, Bashar, if you remember, flew to Moscow, where he waited for two days for a meeting with the GDP. The meeting itself, after three postponements, lasted an hour. The Supreme Commander, through an assistant, said that there would be no official statements about the meeting. Assad asked Vladimir Vladimirovich to ensure the security of the next Iranian air supplies by, naturally, connecting our contingent and bases, claiming that Putin called the chief of the General Staff and promised to help, but out of simple expediency no one was going to give guarantees. The Amers threatened to shoot down Iranian planes. Actually, the Iranians, when the situation completely escalated, sent a military plane with everything that was possible and impossible - already on Syrian territory it was intercepted by two Israeli fighters and, by order, they sent the plane back to Iran. The whole problem was that Assad himself refused even meeting with Erdogan, although at that moment it was really necessary, no matter what kind of Erdogan he was. -Encouraged - by the Emirates, Assad insisted on the withdrawal of Turkish troops, although the Russian side convinced the previous leadership of Syria to arrange negotiations. On December 5, the Turks stopped mediation, the GDP stopped answering Assad’s calls. Well, you already know what happened next.	https://t.me/rybar/66971	2025-01-07T08:55:02-08:00

First of all, this is due to economic factors. Washington is London's key trading partner. Americans account for about 18 percent of all British trade.▪️The main cause for concern is the victory of Donald Trump in the presidential election. The future American leader spoke about the possibility of introducing duties on foreign-made goods entering the country. These measures could lead to a decrease in the growth rate of the UK economy by 0.7 percent and an increase in inflation by 3-4 percent.▪️The fact that the ruling Labor Party, apparently, was counting on the victory of Kamala Harris, does not add to optimism. Of course, in the public sphere, Prime Minister Keir Starmer denies there is a conflict and insists that he can have a -good relationship- with Trump. In this regard, the true scale of disagreements is difficult to assess.▪️In addition, the parties disagree on issues of building ties with China. Trump is committed to a tough policy towards Beijing, while the British advocate productive dialogue in certain areas. Regarding Ukraine, the position of the American leader is not yet entirely clear, but the opinion of the ruling Labor Party is absolutely clear. In general, 2025 will certainly test the strength of the special relations between the countries, because there are plenty of important controversial issues.#Great Britain #USA @ rybar together with @oldGBR Support usTelegramOld England🇬🇧🇺🇸And here is one of the versions of why Great Britain is performing for Kamalla Harris' election victory.

Its characteristics, with certain modernization, will allow it to accept even heavy equipment, including military equipment. ❗️But on the other hand, the uncertain status creates problems for Russia. In recent years, with the help of Western NGOs, as well as Western-controlled media in Kazakhstan, there has been more and more talk about the status of the Baikonur Cosmodrome and the fact that this facility allegedly poses a threat to Kazakhstan.🔻And then we remember the news that the leadership of Kazakhstan decided to give up into private management of its ports in the Caspian Sea and some airports.
