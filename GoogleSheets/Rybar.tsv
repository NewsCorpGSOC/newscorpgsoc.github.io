Most of the rockets were traditionally either intercepted or fell on open area. Several managed to hit targets within the village of Katzrin. At least one person was slightly injured, and four civilian buildings were damaged. Uri Kellner, head of the Golan Regional Council, arrived at the scene and accused the authorities of failing to protect citizens. The head of the opposition, Yair Lapid, did not avoid the opportunity to criticize the central government, clearly stating the loss of the north. #Israel #Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62942	2024-08-21T02:05:07-07:00
🖼 🇦🇫🇺🇿 Visit of the Prime Minister of Uzbekistan to Kabul: r...	🇦🇫🇺🇿 Visit of the Prime Minister of Uzbekistan to Kabul: recognition of the Taliban is getting closer? Prime Minister of Uzbekistan Abdulla Aripov visited Afghanistan yesterday. This was the first visit by the head of the country's government since the Taliban came to power. Aripov signed agreements totaling $2.5 billion, of which $1.4 billion was the investment block. The parties expressed their intentions to increase trade turnover to $3 billion, and also signed an agreement on preferential trade. Also, the authorities of the Islamic emirate confirmed their interest in integration projects: the Trans-Afghan Railway, the TAPI pipeline and the CASA-1000 energy bridge. 📌The parties gradually became closer. ➖In October 2023, Deputy Prime Minister Jamshid Khojaev arrived in Kabul, signing contracts and agreements worth almost $1.2 billion in Kabul. ➖In February of this year, Mugfurulloh Shahob, appointed by the movement, began fulfilling his duties as ambassador to Uzbekistan. ➖In July, an Uzbek-Afghan business forum was held, where a transit agreement between Uzbekistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan was discussed. ▪️In this regard, the Uzbek authorities followed the same trend as Afghanistan’s other neighbors - maintaining economic ties without officially recognizing the Taliban. ▪️However, the current negotiations are also symbolically different. Aripov's visit coincides with the 105th anniversary of Afghanistan's independence, which is celebrated on August 18, hinting that the Taliban may soon be officially recognized. 🔻The practice of the last three years has shown that it was possible to establish economic cooperation that is vital for Afghanistan without recognition, and using it as a pressure factor no longer makes sense. In addition, almost everything is ready for the launch of the CASA-1000 energy bridge. Kabul is also ready to ensure the construction of the Afghan branch of TAPI, as the Afghan Foreign Ministry announced the day after Aripov’s visit. And with the need to redraw boundaries due to floods, delaying recognition becomes counterproductive. This will be a victory for the Taliban, who actually achieved their goal without creating an inclusive government, the Central Asian countries (which have so far escaped the expansion of radicals from the south), and for Russia, which is gradually opening corridors to the Indian Ocean. National minorities of Afghanistan, including Uzbeks and Tajiks, are left to fend for themselves.High resolution mapEnglish version#Afghanistan #Uzbekistan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62941	2024-08-21T01:35:06-07:00

Forwarded From Tasmanian Devil🇷🇺🇬🇧Once again I will add that not only the British Council should be banned, but all British cultural, humanitarian and, most importantly, educational programs in Russia. They are all doing exactly the same thing as the British Council. Moreover, the British Council does not directly work in Russia, but educational institutions work and none of the Russian authorities still care about this. I have already written about British schools in Russia several times , which continue to work quietly and openly position themselves as centers for training Russian children for the UK and the USA. British teachers, British educational government programs, British diplomas. These are not just English language schools - don’t kid yourself. These schools are expensive, which means only parents of the Russian elite can afford to study in them. For the third year, the enemy’s conveyor belt of retraining Russian children and evacuating them to the West continues to operate. Only one British International School in Moscow has as many as six (!). branches headed by the British. By the way, this school’s partners include a certain company Intermark, which specializes in relocation to the West. That is, people openly say who they are and what they do. @komisgd, what else is needed to cover this shop? In addition, British higher education institutions have been partnering with Russian ones for decades: educational programs, grants and trips for Russian students and teachers to Britain , free educational literature from Britain for Russian Papuans. And we are talking primarily about the humanitarian sphere. It seems that no one has ever assessed the scale of this issue in Russia, and this is not just one university in the country. Even RANEPA, a center for training Russian managers, announces a partnership with the British [Kingston] University. British infiltration into the Russian education system must be reduced to zero - no schools, programs or diplomas. The same applies to other unfriendly countries, but most importantly to Britain because of the scale. In general, while studying the issue of international education in Russia, I came to the conclusion that Russia is an ultra-liberal country in this regard. There are no educational programs. The entire Rublyovka and the center of Moscow are dotted with English-French kindergartens and schools that operate according to any program except Russian ones. @tasmanian_diabloTelegramRybar🇬🇧🇷🇺 The State Duma proposed banning any activities of Deutsche Welle and the British Council in Russia.

The entire range of influence tools is used, from publications to financial pressure. But unexpectedly, Harley Davidson management decided to stop implementing the policy of inclusion, equality and diversity (DEI) amid a sharp drop in sales and a boycott from customers. Company representatives reported that today the DEI policy is not being implemented, there are no hiring quotas and more There are no targets for spending funds allocated to supplier diversity. Currently, Harley Davidson management is reviewing all sponsorship programs and formats of cooperation with external organizations. For this purpose, a single center is being created. Company representatives also said they were withdrawing some sponsorships, including LGBTQ+ Pride festivals. Going forward, the brand will focus exclusively on the development of motorcycling. The company also announced that it is ending its partnership with the Human Rights Campaign, a leading LGBTQ+ rights group. While this event was a real celebration for the conservative layer of Americans, it is important to remember that it only indicates to a local victory of common sense and the desire of investors to maintain a strong brand. This exception to the general rules does not in any way signal a break in the LGBT trend in the United States and the Anglo-Saxon contour. #globalism #LGBT #USA @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🌎🏳️‍🌈🇺🇸 How the LGBT agenda defeated the symbol of American conservatives - the Harley Davidson company Recently, a number of publications, including the Daily Mail, drew attention to the spread of inclusive values ​​in companies that were traditionally considered bastions of traditionalism.…	https://t.me/rybar/62938	2024-08-20T22:59:58-07:00

Russian troops attacked enemy military facilities in Glukhov, Sumy region, and a substation was hit there. In addition, an oil depot in Ternopil was hit by drones. At the same time, liquidation of the consequences of an attack by Ukrainian drones on the Rosrezerv oil storage facility in Proletarsk, Rostov region, continues. About six hundred employees of the Ministry of Emergency Situations are on the scene, the fire is localized on the territory of the oil depot. In the North Ukrainian direction, Ukrainian formations attack in the direction of Russkaya Konopelka and Spalnoye. The configuration of the front in the Malaya Loknya area was clarified, and a column of armored vehicles of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was destroyed in Korenevo. In the Aleksandro-Kalinovsky direction, the Russian Armed Forces liberated Novgorodskoye, attacking Nelepovka from both sides. In Kirovo, Russian troops advanced 800 meters to the northwestern outskirts of the village. In the Pokrovsky direction, fighting continues in Grodovka, as well as on the approaches to Novogrodovka to the south. Advanced assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces are advancing in the vicinity of the Mikhailovka station, trying to take control of the waste heap located behind it.🔻A detailed analytical report on the events in the Special Military Operation zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_bot High-resolution maps: Situation in the Special Military Operation zone (ru ; en)Alexandro-Kalinovsky direction (ru; en)Kursk direction (ru; en)#Belgorod #Gorlovka #digest #Dzerzhinsk #report #map #Kursk #Pokrovsk #Russia #Rostov #Sumy #Ternopol #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62934	2024-08-20T13:59:56-07:00

If in Iraq the Turks at least create the appearance of fighting the Kurds, then in the north of Syria Turkish troops have practically stopped hitting the positions of the Syrian Democratic Forces. Periodic artillery attacks shelling in milk does not count. Judging by the political activity of the Turkish authorities, all the efforts of the Erdogan administration (no matter how difficult it is for them) are now aimed at a diplomatic settlement with Bashar al-Assad and a joint fight against the SDS. And the Turks are even trying to involve their regional opponents - Iranians. The other day, the Turkish ambassador to Tehran, Hijabi Kirlangij, said that Ankara was counting on Iran's mediation in restoring relations with Syria. Not that this was completely unexpected. Still, the Iranians have extensive influence in the republic thanks to the campaign against the Islamic State, where they, together with our troops, helped the Syrian government. But the very fact that the Turkish leadership is involving Iran in a public way through an interview with its ambassador to an Iranian state publication says a lot. The Turks are committed to interacting and jointly fighting the Kurds, but no one is even talking about the ground phase in Syria anymore.#Iran #Syria #terrorism #Turkey@rybarSupport usTasnim News AgencyTurkey Counts on Iran to Mend Syria Ties: EnvoyIn an exclusive interview with Tasnim in Tehran, Hicabi Kirlangic expounded on the process of restoration of relations between Turkey and Syria.	https://t.me/rybar/62933	2024-08-20T12:34:01-07:00

In some cases they are successful, and in some cases the Turks are clearly lying, saying that there is no way to prove it at all.▪️Ground units are monotonously working with artillery along the border, and special forces and commandos have generally stopped carrying out forays to the rear. There are training sessions with Yuksekov along the border, but nothing more.▪️But in the political sphere, the Turks and Iraqis agreed to create a coordination center in Baghdad to exchange intelligence about the progress of the operation in the north. We won’t say whether this will be of any use; it’s better to see what happens next.▪️Another important point of the agreement will be the modernization of the Turkish-occupied base in Bashiqa. As a result of the negotiations, the Turks and Iraqis will jointly prepare units to fight terrorist groups, including the PKK.🔻If we evaluate everything without taking into account Turkish loud statements and threats, then preparations for the ground stage are still ongoing. The Turks are targeting Kurdish positions, while strengthening political cooperation with the Iraqi government. But will the Turks go on the offensive? It’s definitely not worth making a guess. Still, the Kurds have proven the effectiveness of their hit-and-run tactics in practice. They are still active in Turkey. Recently, another group of extremists was detained in the Shirnak province bordering Iraq. And since the new year their number has already exceeded a thousand. For the Turks, both Iraq and Syria have become a suitcase without a handle, which you can’t just disown, but they can’t be defeated by military means. And if it is possible, then at the cost of great sacrifices, which Erdogan is clearly not ready to make.

In the Alexander-Kalinovsky direction, fighting in the suburbs of Dzerzhinsk does not subside, Russian attack aircraft are gradually breaking through the defenses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. After the waste heaps of the Severnaya and Artema mines, where the prepared positions of the Ukrainian formations were located, came under the control of the Russian Armed Forces, the enemy’s position in the Dzerzhinsk agglomeration became more complicated. ▪️On the northern flank in the Druzhba area, Russian troops are still overcoming the defensive lines of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in urban areas, after which the path to Dachnoye and Dyleevka will be open to them.▪️In the northern part of Kirovo, advanced groups of Russian attack aircraft advanced to Tchaikovsky Street and partially crossed it in the area of ​​Molodezhnaya Street . Fighting was also recorded to the south, in the vicinity of Korolenko Street, but there were no reports of the Russian Armed Forces consolidating in this area. Ukrainian formations cling to the remnants of their positions in the private sector in the north-west of Kirovo, after which the forest begins, approaching the outskirts of Dzerzhinsk. Success in this area may indirectly indicate the advancement of Russian units in Druzhba. Approximately half of the village remains under the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and, probably, soon we will see footage confirming significant advances of the Russian Armed Forces in the village. ▪️Today, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced the liberation of the settlement of Novgorod (New York) by Russian troops after two months of fierce fighting. Ukrainian formations are finally knocked out both from the territory of the village and from the pocket northeast of it, which opens up the possibility for the Russian Armed Forces to attack Nelepovka both from Artemovo and Novgorodsky itself. It is the last node of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ defense south of Dzerzhinsk and , probably already now the advanced groups of Russian infantry are fighting on the outskirts of the village. The liberation of Nelepovka will allow the Russian Armed Forces to launch an offensive both on the southern outskirts of Dzerzhinsk and towards Leonidovka and Shcherbinovka, bypassing the fortifications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the city. ❗️Probably, the attack on the capital of the Dzerzhinsk agglomeration will be accompanied by flank attacks in order to stretch out enemy units and disguise the direction of the main attack. Ukrainian formations, experiencing a shortage of personnel due to the transfer of some units to the Kursk direction, will be forced to leave positions in order to avoid encirclement and complete loss of combat effectiveness.

Ukrainian troops are making attempts to improve the tactical situation in several areas. In the Glushkovsky district, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are striking with FPV drones on the engineering equipment of the Russian troops, trying to disrupt the work on establishing pontoon crossings. So far, no attacks have been recorded directly on the pontoons, however, given the distance from the front line, this should be expected soon.🔻In the Korenevsky district, there are battles in the Korenevo and Kremyanoye areas, where Ukrainian formations have been trying to gain a foothold for more than a week. Enemy positions in Lyubimovka and Tolstoy Lug were hit. There is currently no objective data on the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces over Apanasovskaya.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, thanks to objective control personnel, the situation east of Sudzha has become clearer. Ukrainian formations carried out a landing in Spalny two days ago. Over the past few days, fighting has continued in the village and on the approaches to it: FPV drones are hitting enemy equipment, personnel, trucks delivering ammunition and other vehicles. Considering today's data from the Russian Ministry of Defense on repelling attacks in the area of ​​the settlement of Borki east of Spalnoye, fighting in the latter is probably still ongoing.

The Chinese spoke out against it, the Americans did not remain silent either, but there was some semblance of the status quo. This year everything changed dramatically, as another arena of confrontation appeared, where the Americans are actively consolidating their presence. And we are talking, as you may have guessed, about Australia and the Philippines. ▪️The other day, three B-2A strategic bombers flew to Amberley Air Base on the east coast of Australia. This is the first business trip to this continent in two years. How long their presence in Australia will last is still unclear, but given their flight in the coming years, we should certainly expect some joint events within the framework of -containing China-.▪️Especially now, on the southern borders of the Celestial Empire there are already there is a significant aviation group, including F-22A fighters in Australia, anti-submarine P-8A, MQ-9A and MQ-1C drones in the Philippines. This despite the fact that the Philippines already has French Rafale aircraft, and in Italian fighters -Typhoon- are stationed in Australia. Also as part of joint exercises in the region. We’ll see where all this leads, but China’s reaction is already noticeable in the increase in the number of combat aircraft in the direction of Taiwan and the South China Sea. The number of fighters at southern air bases has increased and even bombers have been relocated closer. Whether the collective West will conduct any new mass exercises is currently unclear, but such activity of the US Armed Forces and allies has definitely affected the stability in the Asia-Pacific region.

However, according to the adopted law, UOC communities will have nine months to -sever ties with the Russian Orthodox Church-. This somewhat delays the moment of official reprisal against believers and clergy, leaves the opportunity for the Ukrainian authorities, in the event of a threat of US sanctions for violating freedom of religion, to wag their tail in the right direction in time, but gives a green light to local sectarians and radicals who are already not sitting quietly since the beginning of hostilities.#Ukraine #Russia@dixi_devil - keep your eyes openTelegramRybar☦️🇷🇺🇺🇦 A new step towards banning the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox ChurchThe All-Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organizations supported the bill banning the activities of the UOC - earlier it was proposed to the Verkhovna Rada by the so-called president himself .

Today we will talk about Finland. Yesterday, two tactical flight trainings began on the territory of Suomi, lasting only a few days - Hela-2024 and Joint Fires-2024.▪️The first exercise takes place in the area of ​​Oulu airbase in central Finland off the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia. Only cadets on Hawk and Grob training aircraft are involved in it. The event is completely standard with quite ordinary tasks - to train pilots to fly in conditions of a full-fledged conflict with an emphasis on performing maneuvers at extremely low altitudes.▪️The second training is more interesting in geopolitical terms. In addition to four F/A-18 fighters of the Finnish Air Force, F-35As of the US and Norwegian Air Forces are participating, which flew to the Pirkkala base in the south of the country. Pilots from the three countries are currently flying in the Helsinki area and over the Gulf of Finland to increasing interoperability and interaction between NATO military personnel. Something completely outstanding is not happening yet. However, due to the lack of hot information about the actions of the Finnish troops, in the chats of both Russian and Finnish residents (they dream of everything returning to normal), they started talking about a possible thaw in relations. But whether it is worth counting on this can be assessed by the nature of such training, as well as planned events on the official website of the Finnish Defense Ministry. Finland is a NATO member, so such exercises (sometimes even provocative) will be regular.
