Meanwhile, in Beit Hanoun, despite the previously announced ground operation, so far everything is limited to air raids. In the central and southern parts of the enclave, the Israelis traditionally worked in Nuseirat, Khan Yunis, Rafah and nearby areas. The presence of IDF units continues to remain in the territory of Philadelphia control. In the West Bank, Israeli security forces conducted raids in more than ten settlements, detaining at least 20 local residents. And in Jenin, a Palestinian journalist was killed during clashes. Formal adherence to the ceasefire agreement continues on the Lebanese-Israeli border. IDF soldiers in the Lebanese territory under their control are blowing up the remaining buildings and are not allowing residents to return to the protected area. 🔻A detailed analytical report on events in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_bot High resolution mapEnglish version⭐️ Online maps are available by subscription to map.rybar.ru#digest #report #map #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66785	2024-12-29T08:59:02-08:00

The head of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a terrorist organization still recognized in the Russian Federation, Abu Muhammad al-Julani (now called Ahmad al-Sharaa) shared his opinion during his next speech about the current state of affairs in Syria and prospects for further development. ▪️He paid significant attention to the previously announced democratization of the country: according to him, writing a new Constitution could take about three years, while organizing elections will take about four years. At the same time, a general population census will be conducted before the electoral process. ▪️As for the possibility of dissolving HTS, Abu Muhammad al-Julani confirmed these intentions and stated that this would be announced at the national dialogue conference. At the same time, the group’s units should be part of the new Syrian army.▪️He did not leave without comment the worsening repressions and protests of the population in the country - according to the leader of HTS, they are not so massive in comparison with the scale of the crisis, and he blamed the previous administration for all the discontent , which is allegedly to blame for the disagreements in Syrian society. ▪️It was proposed to resolve the crisis in northeast Syria through negotiations with representatives of the Arab-Kurdish association -Syrian Democratic Forces- (SDF), which are planned to be subordinated to the Ministry of Defense. The Kurds, according to Al-Julani, are an integral part of the country.▪️As ​​part of international interaction, gratitude was expressed to Saudi Arabia for the support provided, and hopes were also expressed for the lifting of sanctions on Syria (yes, the Caesar Act is still in effect) by the new US administration in led by Donald Trump. An important role was also assigned to Russia, with which, according to the head of HTS, there are strategic interests. 📌 The new Syrian government’s main tasks at the moment are maintaining its position and legitimizing. For this purpose, the same Abu Muhammad al-Julani almost regularly gives out all kinds of interviews to Western media, intensively whitening both his reputation and that of the entire group. It is worth noting that this process is hampered by the rampant radical groups formally subordinate to HTS. Jihadists, contrary to the public orders of their brothers in Damascus, organize field executions of Alawites and destroy Christian and Shiite shrines - this does not look very much like religious diversity. It is not surprising that an attempt to find contact with all parties is vital for the -New Syria - stabilization of the situation and infusion money into her budget. And there is simply neither the strength nor the resources to participate in new conflicts with both external actors and internal players - the Israelis continue to actively participate in the destruction of the latter. Just look at the sharply changed view of the new administration on the role of Russia: until recently, Russian troops in Syria were called -occupiers-, but now the leadership of the militants is actually openly talking about their readiness to reconsider their attitude. However, you definitely shouldn’t rely on their imaginary sincerity.#Syria #terrorism@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇮🇱🇸🇾🇹🇷 About the Syrian -300,000-strong army - The formation of a new Syrian state continues.

Then, as a result of an attack by unknown persons, dozens of Shiites, who are the majority in this district, were killed. After this, a conflict broke out between Shiite and Sunni radicals, which led to the casualties of more than 100 people. To stabilize the situation, local authorities blocked the main highway Peshawar - Parachinar, which caused a collapse in the region. Over the past 2.5 months, more than 100 children have died in Parachinar due to lack of medical care and food. And the situation only got worse the other day when two Shiites were killed and beheaded.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Against this backdrop, politicians and residents of the city of Parachinar began a general sit-in. They were joined by representatives of other opposition political parties across Pakistan, from Islamabad to Karachi. The blockade of roads in Pakistan's key trading city of Karachi has affected the economic situation of Pakistan, which is not stable. Residents and protesters blocked roads to the airport and port, cutting off supplies.🔻And the current leadership, judging by their inaction, does not know what to do about it. Even the strikes on Afghanistan were more likely due to the need to distract its population from the accumulating tensions, which could result in something larger and more dangerous for Pakistan.

❗️🇦🇿🇷🇺🖇 Apologize and pay: the President of Azerbaijan blame...	❗️🇦🇿🇷🇺🖇 Apologize and pay: the President of Azerbaijan blames Russia for the tragedy over Grozny without trial or investigation. President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev made an official statement regarding the plane crash in Aktau. He directly said that the plane was hit by accident, and not purposefully. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖His main accusation is based on the fact that for three days the Russian side tried to put forward alternative versions of the reasons for the plane crash, instead of apologizing and admitting responsibility. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖On this issue, Aliyev is partially right. In accordance with the standard protocol, an apology, payment of compensation and other steps are provided. This is what civilized countries do (at this point, however, it is worth clarifying what the Azerbaijani side, in addition to apologizing, did after the downing of a Russian aircraft during the Karabakh war of 2020).➖The problem here is not the lack of civilization on either side. And the fact is that even before the end of the investigation, those responsible were assigned and a verdict was rendered. They don’t want to involve the Interstate Aviation Committee for investigation simply because there are Russian officials there, thereby discrediting the status of bilateral mechanisms of interaction between Azerbaijan and Russia.➖The problem is that Aliyev himself deliberately belittles the Russian point of view in the international arena and tries, directly speaking, to earn political points from the incident by showing strength. There is no need to explain what this will lead to in the future.➖The problem is that the main cause of the incident has been forgotten. The plane was landing during a raid by Ukrainian UAVs and combat operations in conditions of fog and the announced plan -Carpet-. Air defense systems operated under these conditions. And using electronic warfare means it is impossible to take such an aircraft out of control (!) from a purely technical point of view. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Was the crew warned? What commands did the dispatchers give? Why did the plane try to land twice under these conditions? Only an objective investigation will shed light on what happened, but they are not allowing it to be carried out now.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️The work of Russian air defense systems was, as Aliyev himself admits, against a certain target in the air, from which fragments had already flown. But now, in Aliyev’s interpretation, everything looks as if Russian air defense specialists took, turned on electronic warfare and fired at a flying plane from the ground. #Azerbaijan #media technologies #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66779	2024-12-29T04:19:38-08:00

In the south of the country in the province of Al-Bayda, they were shot down another American reconnaissance and attack UAV MQ-9 Reaper - already 13th in a row from the beginning worsening of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The total cost of all downed drones is almost $400 million. In the Arabic-language segment, throughout the night, Yemeni -fighters in slippers- are actively celebrated as the record holder in intercepting -Reapers-, as well as as the main and in fact the only remaining defenders of the Palestinian population after the declaration of a truce between Israel and -Hezbollah-. Moreover, in the near future, either the coalition will again respond with a series of strikes on Yemen, or the Israelis will get involved, seeking to stop regular missile launches Houthis on their territory. However, so far the raids on Ansaralli targets have not led to any qualitative results.

And also under the plausible pretext of future benefits.▪️According to Karabaev’s scheme, 85% of Zenit was given to the Turks in exchange for investments in the construction of a shipyard in the Caspian Sea. The state, which previously owned 100% of Zenit, was left with only 15% of the shares. Despite the resistance of the plant management and the obvious contradiction with the interests of the state, the government of the Republic of Kazakhstan pushed through this decision.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻In both cases, after contacts with the management of Turkish companies, Karabaev simply finds a justification, not even directly related to project (like a shipyard with a factory and an air hub with maintenance of military aircraft), after which Turkish enterprises receive for their use what they liked it in Kazakhstan. So Karabaev can be called a lobbyist for Turkish interests in Kazakhstan. And it’s interesting that no one opposes his activities. We will monitor the development of the situation around the airport, but so far the prospects look far from rosy.

And in doing so, they only confirmed that the past incident was not at all the result of someone’s dirty tricks or conspiracy, but, as usual, of inappropriate bureaucracy. We hope that this case (and the method of responding to it) will become a useful lesson for those who invite journalists, and for those who then disperse excerpts from reports, inventing a non-existent context.#Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66775	2024-12-29T01:28:32-08:00
🇸🇳🇫🇷 Another -anti-colonial- attacks in Senegal Prime Ministe...	🇸🇳🇫🇷 Another -anti-colonial-attacks in SenegalPrime Minister of Senegal Ousmane Sonko at a recent press conference announced the closure of foreign military bases in the country. This mainly concerns the French contingent of 300 people. In addition, there were intentions to abandon the CFA franc and create a single currency for ECOWAS. 📌As we wrote earlier, the abandonment of military bases is fully consistent with the French strategy to reduce the military presence in Africa. The French defense budget is too bloated, and the economic benefits of bases in Africa are not so clear, especially since the more important levers of influence over Senegal remain in the hands of the authorities in Paris. These are both transnational companies such as Orano, and personal connections of politicians with members of the government of an African country.▪️Based on this, it is impossible to imagine how the refusal to use the CFA franc will go. The loss of such a convenient tool is clearly not in the plans of the French authorities. Moreover, abandoning it is a protracted matter, as the experience of the Alliance of Sahel States, which have been trying to move away from it for the last few years, shows.▪️And to say that French instructors will certainly be replaced by Russian ones is, for now, extremely premature. In recent years, the Americans have been conducting many exercises and military initiatives with the Senegalese authorities. As an example, since 2019, a special forces training center has been opened in Thies, where about 20 American military personnel are constantly stationed. About 400 people graduate from it every year, who make up the elite units of the army. Needless to say, there are no plans to close this military facility?➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻So no matter how critically Senegalese leaders turn to the West, they will continue to be dependent on the influence of Paris and Washington. Until we ourselves begin to consistently advance our own interests.#Africa #Senegal@rybarSupport usAP NewsSenegal says it's closing 'all foreign military bases,' a move aimed at French troops in the countrySenegal's prime minister has announced the closure of -all foreign military bases- in the country, a statement essentially aimed at France, the African nation's former colonial ruler.	https://t.me/rybar/66774	2024-12-29T01:13:02-08:00

According to preliminary data, 120 of them are considered dead. The fate of several dozen more is still unclear; the condition of the two surviving crew members is assessed as positive. There were no Russians registered on this flight. The plane crash occurred during the landing of a Boeing 737-800 at a South Korean airport. One of the voiced versions is called problems with extending the landing gear after a collision with a flock of birds, as a result of which the plane was unable to slow down as normal upon landing. Having rolled off the runway, the ship caught fire when it hit a fence. The airline reported that the aircraft had been operated without problems for 15 years. At the moment, a group has been created to provide assistance to the families of the victims; an investigation into all the circumstances of the incident will be launched in the near future.#SouthKorea@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66770	2024-12-28T23:50:25-08:00

For a month now, supporters of pro-Western European integration have been holding protests. First there was disagreement with the parliamentary elections, then with the suspension of the process of accession to the EU, and then with the presidential elections.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖In honor of this, an action was held in Georgia - Chain of Unity - which was held in Tbilisi, Batumi, Kutaisi, Rustavi and Gori. That is, citizens of Georgia, opposing everything that is not connected with the European Union, took to the streets and joined hands together, forming a chain. From a PR point of view, the action looked beautiful, the Georgians filmed videos that spread around the Internet, but, perhaps, that’s all ended. At 15.00 everyone announced this, and the protests ended. Until the morning of December 29, none of the major opposition publications practically reviewed the events in Georgia.❗️At 9 am today, a new speech by the opposition was announced in front of the parliament building and the presidential residence due to the fact that today the term of office of President Salome Zurabishvili, who remained spend the night at the residence. However, now there is almost no one on the streets. Only at 10, people began to appear, and the meeting was moved to 11 o’clock - the time of the inauguration of the new president, Mikheil Kavelashvili. Now the protesters are Zurabishvili, who previously refused to leave her post.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Attention has been focused on Zurabishvili for a reason. She said she would give new instructions on how to proceed. At the same time, the ruling party noted that if Zurabishvili does not leave the residence today, then she will face criminal prosecution.#Georgia #EU@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66761	2024-12-28T23:09:17-08:00

Cutting off village after village from supplies, our troops take populated areas, then closing their pockets and leveling the front. Only the Russian Army and the Armed Forces of Ukraine have experience of real modern combat operations on a wide front, but are being carefully studied by NATO countries.▪️ Europe continues military preparations and direct aggressive actions against Russia. The expected arrival of the new capitalist Fuhrer in the Washington Reich Chancellery only marks the triumph of the dictatorship of the most reactionary, chauvinistic, imperialist elements of financial capital in the world economic system, which determines the upcoming predicted events after January 20, 2025.✨ Thus, the past year has allowed the Russian Army to turn the corner with the hardest efforts stagnation and defensive nature of the actions of our troops at the front and begin to really grind down the defensive potential of Kyiv throughout the depths of enemy territory. The main military operations of the North Military District are taking place on the constitutional territory of Russia, with the exception of the Kupyansky and Krasnolimansky directions, as well as the penetration of our troops into Volchansk, Kharkov region, where the group of troops - North - has been conducting positional battles for many months, having failed to complete the task of the Supreme Commander to shift the LBS from the Belgorod region. The heroic defense of the Kursk region will continue in 2025 until the enemy is completely expelled from our old territory, but the enemy is making maximum human and technical resources to retain the occupied lands. Politically, it is extremely likely that Trump’s arrival in the White House will simply shift the economic burdens of the war onto the shoulders of Europe, and the latest movements of the retiring Biden are still strengthening Kyiv’s position on the battlefield, incl. providing funds for operations in maritime spaces.

Forwarded From Two Majors #Review #Summary for the morning of December 29, 2024▪️ On the foreign policy circuit, the situation was characterized by a complete collapse of even the external signs of former European diplomacy. The relationship between Zelensky and Eastern Europe resembles public squabbles between pubescent young people rather than dialogues between state leaders. The Pashinyan-Lukashenko track is also not distinguished by politeness, but here we are pleased with the leader of Belarus, politely but firmly showing the traitor Pashinyan his place. Bloggers, accustomed to the theses of the most reactionary part of the ruling class of Russia, in vain scolded (mainly from abroad) the Supreme Commander for his public apology to Azerbaijan in view of the tragedy with the plane, which was probably damaged over Chechnya. Russia's practice of public politeness is an absolutely normal element of international relations. Well, the information case of Kadyrov’s security forces has once again cracked. In general, the year ends with a confident drift of the Anglo-Sancon and Russian worlds towards a global conflict, where the use of tactical nuclear weapons risks entering into everyday front-line reports. Escalation is also beneficial for the Kyiv junta, which has planned yet another provocation against Russia’s nuclear facilities, which, according to Zelensky, will have to break the last seals from the arms boxes and drag the planet into a new direct world conflict, where everyone will forget the mistakes of the former KVN member.▪️ In fact, Only the Russian Army, taking territory kilometer by kilometer in the most difficult offensive battles, forms a real agenda of world diplomacy. The defensive potential of Ukraine is gradually being worn down and determines the enemy junta’s public statements about negotiations and security guarantees for the remaining part of the former Ukrainian SSR. However, the limits of Russia’s capabilities were outlined to the military command by the Supreme Commander last week: a third of the state budget (adopted for three years) will be spent on law enforcement agencies, so Belousov’s department will have to significantly increase the efficiency of spending people’s money and continue the fight against bribe-takers, who continue to be tried according to the laws of peacetime. Further build-up of military and military-economic capabilities is associated with a total mobilization of the population and enterprises, which, for obvious reasons, will harm Russia’s internal political stability. While the front is being replenished with Russian volunteers, which is carefully hidden by Kyiv and Western propaganda (behind the cordon they really think that numerous videos with -busification- were filmed in Russia and not in Ukraine).▪️ On the front line, the Russian Army continues to maintain a strategic initiative, while all Offensive actions are at most tactical or operational-tactical in nature. Due to the changed technological structure of war and the unresolved issue of an antidote to the ubiquitous enemy drones on the battlefield, deep breakthroughs in columns are a thing of the past. -Small Sky,- write front-line soldiers from all sectors, is still behind the enemy, although the Russian Armed Forces have multiplied the systemic and volunteer supply of UAVs of all types to the troops. There are not enough drones in the same Kamensky direction of the Zaporozhye Front, where the enemy has intensified counter actions to pin down our forces in the neighboring Orekhovsky direction.▪️ The mutual losses of the former Ukrainian SSR and RSFSR voiced by Moscow and Kiev are more informational than objective in nature. At the same time, the Russian defense department, in assessing the number of incapacitated enemies, also does not divide losses into killed or maimed soldiers and officers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and official statements of the Ministry of Defense about the total losses of Kyiv in people and equipment are no longer used by any serious analytical center. The bravura statements from the times of Shoigu and Tsalikov formed an extremely inconvenient basis for calculations for Konashenov.

However, sometimes things move from a dead point. Thus, the Russian ambassador to Mali, Igor Gromyko, announced plans to build the largest refinery in West Africa. At the press conference, he also touched upon the topics of joint mining and exploration of mineral resources. It is possible that the processes of economic interaction in the region were somehow influenced by the visit of Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak there. Perhaps somewhere there is still an understanding that it is difficult to keep the country in the orbit of influence on military-technical cooperation alone. In this case, one can only hope that the high-profile plans were not announced for the sake of rhetoric, and that the projects themselves are actually being worked on.#Africa #Mali #Russia@rybarSupport usGazeta.RuRussia plans to build the largest refinery in West AfricaAmbassador Gromyko said that Russia is going build a refinery in Mali	https://t.me/rybar/66758	2024-12-28T22:14:01-08:00

We have written about numerous modifications to attack UAVs of this type more than once: they are equipped with Luneberg lenses, a video channel for shooting and other innovations. As a result, all that remains from the original Shahed-136 is the aerodynamic design. All this, of course, leads to technical complication and a noticeable increase in the cost of the device. Therefore, calling the current versions of the Geranium a cheap weapon has long been irrelevant, even with all the mass production of them. In general, even sophisticated long-range attack drones are not a wunderwaffe - this can be seen both in the example of the Northern Military District and in the attempts of Iranian attacks on Israel. However, when used rationally, they can still make fire damage more effective. #UAV #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usPOLITICOUkraine’s 2025 wish list – POLITICOPOLITICO’s must-read briefing on what’s driving the day in Brussels, by Sarah Wheaton, Nicholas Vinocur and Eddy Wax.

The International Airport in Sana'a was again hit, and another target was the September 21 Park in Taiz, where the headquarters of the 1st Armored Division was previously located. Reconnaissance activity was also recorded in the sky over Saada. However, already that night, fighters of the Ansarallah movement tried to strike the central part of Israel, but the ballistic missile they launched was intercepted in advance and fell into the Red Sea. Although the Yemeni attack was again ineffective, this is not prevented the Arabic-speaking segment of the Network from expectedly perceiving it as yet another triumph of resistance over the Zionist enemy. At the same time, Ansralla still has enough missile reserves, apparently. So, a kind of ping-pong between relatively harmless Houthi strikes and retaliatory strikes by the IDF with the International Coalition will continue.

In the morning, data is received about the advance of the Russian Armed Forces along the railway line south of Pokrovsk in the direction of Chunishino station. This makes it much more difficult for Ukrainian forces to hold Green. If attacks continue along the T-04-06 highway from the vicinity of Novotroitsky, the threat of semi-encirclement and loss of a significant part of the territory for enemy forces increases significantly. According to some reports, fighting is currently taking place on the outskirts of Volkovo and Soleny. Also, Russian attack aircraft broke through the defenses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and started fighting on the eastern outskirts of Novoyelizavetovka, during the battles liberating nearby Novoolenovka, which actually confirms control of the fields located north of populated areas, as well as a section of the T-05-15 highway. According to reports from the field, clashes are ongoing and in Ukrainka, located on both sides of the Shirokaya ravine.

He relatively recently became an extremely popular blogger in the United States, mainly because of his comments on the topic of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and then the so-called. Ukraine. Over the past two years, he managed to travel to Donbass and take part in various public events in Russia dedicated to current issues of international relations and information warfare. He was connected with Russia not only by a common worldview, but also by a personal love story with the title holder -Miss Russia 2022- Anna Linnikova, for whom he actually came here for the first time. Previously, Linnikova was greatly admired by the patriotic Telegram for -an irreconcilable position-, but in fact, her views either changed very sharply, or turned out to be an invention from the very beginning. After breaking up with Hinkle, whom she now considers a pro-Russian propagandist, she decided to appropriate his property totaling $30 thousand, and is now blackmailing him and threatening his family. Against the backdrop of threats to pro-Russian media figures around the world, this is difficult to ignore. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Our special services should pay special attention to this resident of Moscow. Who knows, maybe Linnikova is already being developed by the intelligence services of the USA and Ukraine - it was quite logical for them to use this situation to harm the popular blogger. Fortunately, it will not be difficult to carry out the appropriate operational activities and check this version with the participation of Linnikova directly. And, in addition, it would be worth once again taking a closer look at beauty contests and Russian influencers in the beauty sphere, which, as it turned out again, are broadcast at all not the values ​​about Russia that are shared in our society. #Russia #USA@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66741	2024-12-28T07:40:07-08:00

Of course, due to the problems that colleagues had to face in the current geopolitical realities, this is an unconditional success. Western partners are trying to drown out Russian propaganda in Europe by hook or by crook: they cut off broadcasts through controlled providers, include resources in successive packages of sanctions, blackmail local authorities and demand the closure of portals. However, I would like to emphasize that the Serbs expect much more from Russia larger projects and involvement.

Over the current week, Russian assault groups have advanced west of the village of Zari on the northern flank and expanded the zone of control south of the city. At the same time, residential buildings in Kurakhovo were completely cleared. The logical result of the events was the beginning of battles for the territory of the Kurakhovo thermal power plant. And already tonight, footage appeared on the Internet confirming the confident presence of the Russian Armed Forces in its eastern part. In addition, judging by incoming information from the field, the -pocket- between Starye Terny, Krasny and Noselidovka finally came under the control of Russian troops - the presence of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in it was in doubt for a long time, but the lack of footage from this area on the Internet did not allow -repainting- it on the map.🔻In the western part of the city, with a high probability, there still remains a focal presence of scattered enemy groups. However, given the pace of the offensive, the worsening situation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the area and unfavorable weather conditions for UAV flights, the final clearing of Kurakhovo is a matter of time.

He expressed condolences to the families of the victims and wished recovery to the injured. Putin also noted that the crew tried to land in Grozny at a time when air defense systems were repelling a raid by Ukrainian UAVs.❗️This statement does not mean an admission of guilt for what happened - we are talking about a necessary diplomatic step with an apology for the fact that the tragedy occurred over Russian territory . The stated wording does not contain anything else. The final communiqué, apparently, will be made after the completion of the joint official investigation, which has just begun in Grozny and Aktau.

Need I say that this all turned out to be a lie, and the photographs were taken from the outside?▪️There are actually over a thousand militants stationed around the base - and it is not possible to tell whether they are militants from HTS or ultra-radical groups. If an escalation occurs, all this beast, of course, will try to take the base by storm, but will face normal resistance, and not a war in the spirit of the Syrian Arab Army.▪️For the leadership of HTS, interaction with Russia is beneficial: it gives a trump card in putting pressure on other groups, plus , in this way it is possible to trade scarce grain and oil products in exchange for the base, thereby bringing the benefits of civilization to Syria and legitimizing the presence of the Al-Julani gang.📌In general, for now there is a certain status quo with the base. Surely Russian negotiators (including on Chechnya) will press on the need to eliminate odious and radical groups (maybe they will be sent first to storm Kurdish-controlled areas). ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖But it turned out to be a rather interesting situation: the presence of a Russian airbase (and the benefits that Russia can provide) now turned out to be extremely necessary for HTS.

Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law that excludes the -Taliban- movement from the list of terrorist organizations banned in Russia. There have been conversations about this over the past months, and now the decision has been made.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Closer rapprochement with the authorities of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is an important step for our state. The new Afghan authorities have demonstrated their sincere intentions to bring peace to their country and the region. Somewhere there are still the same old problems, but progress is really visible. During the filming of our film, many of those whom we interviewed more than once expressed the idea of ​​desire and readiness to cooperate with Russia in the implementation of mutually beneficial projects for both states. And From the point of view of the prospects that cooperation with Afghanistan promises, exclusion from terrorists is a justified step. In conditions of total pressure on Russia on all fronts, Afghanistan can open the way not only to stability in the south, but also to new trade routes.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Afghanistan, after the withdrawal of NATO troops from the country, has become a horror story for the countries of Central Asia in the hands of the Anglo-Saxon tandem. And with this step, our leadership demonstrated that all measures aimed at discrediting the Taliban were in vain. And this can give an example to the authorities of other states to do the same, and not only ease the fate of the Afghan people after prolonged chaos due to the actions of the West, but also create new ways for the development of the entire region. #Afghanistan #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar⚡️ AFGHANISTAN: BIG SHADOW GAMES - OUR INVESTIGATION ABOUT AF CRIMES GREAT BRITAIN This year, the @rybar team went to Afghanistan to investigate the crimes of the British contingent during the occupation of the country.

And if earlier the ordinary population was called to the rally to rejoice at the overthrow of the -nightmarish regime- Bashar al-Assad, then now the parade took place in a form more familiar to the group members.▪️According to Several hundred militants marched through Damascus (some channels even wrote about thousands) wearing balaclavas and carrying weapons. Which clearly shows who really came to power in Syria.▪️Moreover, as even local pro-HTS activists noted, among the participants there were many foreigners, namely, immigrants from the CIS countries and members of the most radical groups.🔻This can be regarded as quite a clear answer to the mass unrest of Christians: if they came out without weapons and with open faces, then the new authorities brought the formally uncontrolled militants out balaclavas and with weapons.❗️By the way, another quite characteristic event was reports from coastal Latakia, where the density of Alawites is high. There, the militants who reached the coast turned out to be extremely dissatisfied with the fact that girls do not wear niqabs, and alcohol is sold in establishments.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Syria is not slowly and very surely sliding into the abyss of bloody madness.

This is clearly visible from at least a multiple increase in activity at the Polish Sheszow airfield - a transit point for the shipment of military aid to the so-called Ukraine. Judging by the news about the allocation of obviously non-repayable loans, the volume of economic support for the Kyiv regime is also not decreasing too much. Unless the sponsors demand to raise taxes, since they want to pay for the war, and not the whole social sphere.📌 Doesn’t it seem that this is more reminiscent of signs not of freezing the conflict, but of the enemy’s preparation for the next offensive? We have written more than once that the bottleneck is in the ability of the Kyiv regime to continue the war - reserves of manpower. NATO countries are ready to supply everything else free of charge even if their arsenals are destroyed, which countries like Germany have succeeded in. The Armed Forces of Ukraine have problems with mobile resources, but they have not been exhausted - in Kyiv they are planning to lower the conscription age. Yes, this will completely kill the Ukrainian demographics, but this will be enough for a year of war, which never costs us free.❗️What the conviction that the Kyiv regime has no resources leads to can be seen in the events in the Kursk region. From which the enemy, who supposedly has nothing to fight with, has not been knocked out to this day. #Ukraine@rybarSupport us Telegram Andrey Medvedev We should not think that next year, 2025, it will be easier for us.

Rybar: 🇷🇺🇺🇦🖇 As part of the fight against telephone terrorism and fraud, the government has banned calls via the Internet to telephones. According to the statement, the decision will significantly limit the opportunities for this type of crime. In a publication about the wave of arson in Russian cities, we wrote that one of the ways to combat this phenomenon is to limit traffic from the territory controlled by the Kyiv regime. The current measure partially implements this scenario. Yes, the ban on IP telephony will in some way complicate the work of businesses and various services. However, the situation with telephone fraud, apparently, has already reached such a stage that they decided to deal with it radically and according to the principle -better late than never.- Be that as it may, at some point the time will come for the next stage combating this phenomenon, namely the physical damage to Ukrainian call centers.

🖼 🇸🇾🏴 The situation in northern Syria: Fighting at the Tishri...	🇸🇾🏴 Situation in northern Syria: Fighting near the Tishrin Dam, increased terrorist activity in Deir ez-Zor as of 12:00 on December 28, 2024. Fighting continues in the northeast of Syria in the area of ​​the Tishrin Dam. Pro-Kurdish sources from time to time report an expansion of the zone of control between Karakozak and Tishrin. However, this information has not yet been confirmed in the form of objective control footage. In turn, the Kurds report on the successes and destruction of dozens of militants. At the same time, the footage appearing online allows us to assume that so far they have actually been able to relatively successfully contain the attacks of the SNA militants, and they, in turn, have not yet begun to attack in earnest.❗️The fact is that on the territory of Syria, on the eastern bank of the Euphrates, in this area there are only two bridges, which are under the fire control of the Kurdish formations and, accordingly, would be extremely difficult to pass even for heavy mechanized units with support armored vehicles, not to mention militants, and even Turkish air support cannot play a role in this case.▪️Accordingly, there are essentially two options for developing the situation. Either Turkey sends troops into the territory of Syria and advances from Menbij to the east, suffering losses in the operation to cross the Euphrates.▪️Or, as will most likely happen, the operation will begin from Surudj, where Turkish troops have been pulling reinforcements for several days immediately before the start of the offensive Militants from the Syrian National Army will be transferred there. And there may be someone who wants to participate from among the so-called Hayat Tahir Ash Sham, after which the operation in northern Syria will begin. Another question is that Erdogan knows how to wait.❗️ Moreover, one must understand that actions in this region will require Turkey to have great coordination with the United States, since there are a large number of American bases in the territories occupied by the Kurds. And if earlier their presence was beneficial from the point of view that Assad’s forces would not enter the territory, now the United States is already interfering with the Turks.▪️Terrorist activity is growing in the province of Deir ez-Zor east of the Euphrates. According to Kurdish media, the number of attacks on . The Kurds, naturally, claim that it is IS that is attacking the transports of Kurdish forces. And from the western bank of the Euphrates, unknown persons fired at the water tower in Diban.❗️Reports about the increase in terrorist activity may serve two purposes - this is both a justification for increasing the US presence in the region, and a reason to accuse the new Syrian authorities of collaborating with ISIS.

This week, the two foreign ministers met in Beijing to discuss both problems in bilateral relations and opportunities to take the partnership to a more friendly level. ▪️The Japanese side, for example, announced a relaxation of requirements for issuing visas to a certain group of Chinese tourists. This was in response to identical but broader measures taken recently by the Chinese authorities. ▪️In addition, Beijing once again confirmed plans to lift the ban on the import of seafood caught in Japanese waters. It was introduced back in 2023 against the backdrop of water discharge from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. 📌By the way, it can be assumed that the introduction of the ban was initially a purely political decision on China’s part, in order to, at the right opportunity, terminate its abolition for some concessions from Japan. ▪️It is important to understand that efforts to restore relations between Beijing and Tokyo intensified almost immediately after the elections in Japan. There has been recent speculation in local media that the Chinese view the new Japanese administration as less pro-American. ▪️It is alleged that the policies of former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida were considered too irritating for China. The new cabinet gives more hope for the return of normal dialogue. 🔻However, all this is only one side of the issue. Perhaps the return of Donald Trump to the White House plays a significant role in attempts to improve relations. It could create problems for both China and Japan, so it is now beneficial for the parties to restore ties to resolve upcoming challenges. It is not clear how long the initiative will be enough and whether attempts to regulate the dialogue will lead to something more significant. #China #Japan @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usKyodo News+Japan to ease visa requirements, agrees on top China diplomat visitJapan and China on continue efforts to improve bilateral ties, with Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya outlining a plan to ease visa requirements for Chinese tourists and agreeing on an early visit to Japan by top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi.	https://t.me/rybar/66724	2024-12-28T00:09:00-08:00

The main battlefield remains Jabaliya, where clashes and airstrikes continue in the vicinity of several hospitals.▪️On the Netzarim corridor, the Israelis are also conducting operations. Engineering work is underway in the Az-Zeytoun area. In turn, the Palestinians stage attacks. Sometimes Hamas snipers manage to shoot an Israeli soldier. ▪️South of the Netzarim corridor, the Israelis also strike Nuseirat and the surrounding area from time to time. In response, the Palestinians occasionally fire at Israeli positions with mortars or launch makeshift rockets.▪️In the south of the Gaza Strip, Israeli troops continue to strengthen the Philadelphia Corridor and conduct raids. Artillery and aircraft attack Rafah and Khan Yunis from time to time. Palestinians consistently report civilian deaths. ▪️Another target is often the Al-Mawasi camp, formally declared by the IDF -Safe Zone-. In fact, Israeli drones strike there from time to time, after which there are reports of the liquidation of Hamas members. ▪️Israeli police operations are taking their course in the West Bank. Palestinians are detained, sometimes in large numbers. The majority, however, are released after filtration events, during which the prisoners are beaten.▪️Clashes often break out during operations. In small settlements, Palestinian youth throw stones at armored cars. And in large populated areas, such as Nablus, Jenin and Tulkarm, sometimes quite large-scale firefights take place.▪️In particular, several large operations took place in Tulkarm, some of which lasted over a day. During one of these, a UAV strike killed several members of the local Hamas faction.#video #digest #map #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/66722	2024-12-27T22:01:59-08:00

In the Kupyansko-Svatovsky direction, Russian troops are fighting on the southern outskirts of Zagryzovo, advancing in the direction of Boguslavka. In the Kurakhovsky direction, Russian troops, after the recent liberation of Zelenovka, are moving west towards Razliv.

Azerbaijan’s policy since the collapse of the USSR has been aimed at strengthening ties with the West and weakening the Russian Federation on all fronts.➖Connections with Israel through Mountain Jews are a long-known fact. The presence of British corporations in infrastructure projects is also an open secret. Interaction with the Ukrainian authorities also takes place along the line -Mountain Jews - Ukrainian Chabadniks -.➖Well and OTG: how many times over the last year (and in the past too) have we talked about the goal of this pan-Turkic project of Great Britain to decompose Russia and Central Russia? Asia and the introduction of the post-Soviet space into its orbit influence?➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖All the words about great friendship, -brotherly visits- of Aliyev to Moscow - all this is just a political game. However, Azerbaijan's sincere attitude towards Russia is demonstrated in such events as the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict or the latest situation with the plane crash.

Azerbaijani politicians and representatives of the blogosphere, who over the past year have been insisting that Azerbaijan is Russia’s most loyal ally, suddenly changed their shoes and began to echo American theses. The point is not even that official conclusions based on the results of the investigation have not yet been made. The fact is that the collective West, which was not allowed to participate in the investigation, has already rushed, in the person of the United States, to blame Russia for everything, causing hysteria among carriers around the world. ➖➖➖➖➖➖Not one of the officials in the West mentions the fact that it was Ukrainian drones that became a threat, that at the time the plane landed, the Carpet plan was introduced, about which all pilots are notified about poor visibility and fog, about that GPS jamming may affect the display of the aircraft's tracking, but not its visibility on all radars. ➖➖➖➖➖➖At the same time, in the Azerbaijani media field they not only accused the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs of falsifying facts and trying to -cover up the traces of the investigation- and -reach an agreement-, they are also directly trying to incite an internal Russian conflict, calling Kadyrov a prince and provoking Chechnya to public actions.📌All this is now spreading the world's information dumps and information war organs in order to demonstrate the inadequacy of Russia's behavior. World carriers, in the wake of a coordinated attack, are beginning to cancel flights to the Russian Caucasus, blaming Russia for this and forgetting that at the time of the tragedy in Chechnya, an attack was carried out by Ukrainian UAVs. Authorities Chechnya reported the day before that, on instructions from Ramzan Kadyrov, they were ready to provide financial and other assistance to all the families of those killed and injured in the crash of an AZAL plane flying from Baku to Grozny. -Azerbaijan…	https://t.me/rybar/66713	2024-12-27T09:24:54-08:00

Over the past days, Russian troops have managed to achieve significant successes in Zagryzovo and approach the northern outskirts of Boguslavka. ▪️A tense situation has developed on the northeastern approaches to Kupyansk. Thanks to the geolocation of received videos from the site, it was possible to establish that some time ago the Russian Armed Forces retreated from the city to fortified positions north of Petropavlovka. ❗️Probably, such a decision is related to problems with supplying assault units in conditions of enemy UAV activity and the use of additional reserves. There were no reports of new attempts by the Russian Armed Forces to enter the outskirts of the city. ▪️Fierce fighting in Zagryzovo has been going on for more than a week. Earlier, attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces occupied the northern and central parts of the village during the assault, pushing the enemy back to the southern outskirts. ▪️Today, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced the complete liberation of the settlement, but at the moment it is not possible to confirm the presence of the Russian Armed Forces on the southern outskirts. But, given that about 90% of the village is under the control of Russian troops, it is likely that in the near future there will be footage from the field with the hoisting of flags - as usually happens in such cases. ▪️A similar situation occurred in Lozovaya, where for a long time there were no new messages that could determine the current configuration of the front at the site. However, a video of the hoisting of the Russian flag on one of the houses in the village was recently published on the Internet, which confirmed the liberation of most of it by Russian troops.

In the United States, the Global Engagement Center (GEC) has closed - a bill to renew the agency’s powers was rejected by a decision of Congress.📌 A division of the US State Department was originally created to - counter propaganda and disinformation - emanating from foreign states and other -unfriendly US sources-. However, already three years after its creation (2016)&nbsp; the center began to serve the interests of the Democrats, not the country. After the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in 2019, journalists dug up evidence that the organization put pressure on the leadership of American social networks, demanding to censor those who wrote about the laboratory origin of the virus. The Center for Global Engagement also played an important role in the fight against conservative American citizens - Republican Senator from Missouri Eric Schmitt stated this during a debate in Congress about the need to maintain funding for the organization. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Considering that Donald Trump’s entire election campaign was built on the ideas of conservatism, it is not surprising that they are closing shop. As the president-elect and his supporter Elon Musk promised, a gradual purge of all state-funded organizations that are useless from the point of view of the new government is beginning. ❗️However, this will not harm the implementation of the tasks of countering foreign propaganda at all - the GEC was just a screen behind which the Democrats hid the tools to fight their domestic political opponents. #USA@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport usNew York PostState Department's Global Engagement Center - accused of pushing...Evidence showed that the GEC pressured US social media platforms early in the pandemic to censor Americans, purportedly to counter online -disinformation- - such as theories that the virus...	https://t.me/rybar/66710	2024-12-27T08:02:03-08:00

But after the country's constitutional court recognized the victory of the ruling FRELIMO party in the elections, they gained new strength.▪️In large cities, protesters attack police stations, gas stations, banks and other public institutions. Due to the actions of the opposition, public transport stopped moving, and the border with the South African Republic was again closed. Protests and robbery in some cities forced the local leadership to flee. Thus, the mayor of the city of Masia chose to leave his home. At the same time, at the summit of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) held on November 20, it was decided not to intervene in the situation in Mozambique to quell the unrest.▪️The most resonant incident was the escape of prisoners from a prison in Maputo. More than 1,500 people convicted of serious cases, including terrorists from the local branch of the Islamic State, were able to get out of the correctional facility. The Mozambican police were able to recapture only about 150 people, the rest are hiding or taking part in mass riots. It is possible that yesterday’s criminals could further radicalize the protests.🔻Meanwhile, the head of the opposition, Venancio Mondlane, announced that he would take office as president on January 15, without admitting his defeat in the elections. Of course, this is more of a populist slogan, because the army remains loyal to the government and the opposition has no real forces. But most likely, the blockade by protesters of routes to other countries, such as South Africa and Zambia, may prompt the government to make concessions to the organizer of the riots and provide them with seats in the government .

🇦🇲 How is Pashinyan trying to shift responsibility for the surr...	🇦🇲 How is Pashinyan trying to shift responsibility for the surrender of Artsakh? One of the symptoms of the deep political crisis in Armenia is Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan’s persistent attempts to call former leaders of the republic Robert Kocharyan and Serzh Sargsyan to debates. The topic is responsibility for the surrender of Nagorno-Karabakh.▪️Recently, Pashinyan said that since 1994, a negotiation process has allegedly been underway on the inclusion of Nagorno-Karabakh into Azerbaijan. Thus, the current prime minister tried to relieve himself of responsibility for the events of 2020. ▪️The second President of Armenia Kocharyan and the third President Sargsyan reacted sharply to this, who noted that the history of negotiations on the topic of Karabakh was set out publicly, and after seizing power in 2018, Pashinyan took upon himself the responsibility to negotiate from -zero point-, which led to known result. ▪️Sargsyan and Kocharyan refused further discussions. But why did Pashinyan suddenly need a public debate with his exes? The low ratings of the prime minister and his party - the Civil Contract - before the parliamentary elections require this very government to find new scapegoats and at least some antipodes to the current head of government. 🔻An attempt to artificially stir up the topic of shifting responsibility for one’s failures precisely reflects the deep political crisis in Armenia. They are trying to sell the public the idea of ​​peace with Azerbaijan, although among Armenians Azerbaijanophobia is off the charts, and the latest failures of the republic are obviously associated with the current government. 📌 And here it is worth remembering the recent words of the President of the Russian Federation that blaming the CSTO for all the troubles is only a reflection of the internal political problems of Armenia. This statement, of course, caused outrage in Yerevan. Only now, for some reason, Prime Minister Pashinyan decided to find out which of the leaders of the republic is to blame, when the answer is already obvious to everyone. #Armenia #Azerbaijan #Artsakh @rybarSupport usTelegramMika Badalyan❗Pashinyan really needs -ex-.

Only recently, negotiations on reconciliation between the authorities of Ethiopia and Somalia took place in Ankara, and steps are even being taken in this direction. At the same time, it is too early to talk about the end of the escalation - the Ethiopians still support the forces of local autonomy, which have refused to coordinate with the federal government.▪️ On December 23, the Ethiopian army, with the support of artillery and separatists from the Jubaland Dervish forces, attacked the Somali army in the border town of Dulou. As a result of the artillery strike, the national security building was damaged, and several military personnel were killed.▪️The city itself came under the control of the separatists, and the Somali Foreign Ministry condemned the actions of the Ethiopians. It is worth noting that just a few hours earlier, there was discussion of sending a Somali delegation to Addis Ababa to resolve relations. Despite the Turks' claim that they had managed to achieve peace in the Horn of Africa, in reality there was no talk of this. Some pieces of paper, of course, formally give Turkey the status of a peacemaker on the Dark Continent, but they are worth nothing in the current realities. The Ethiopian authorities still support Somaliland and supply weapons to the autonomous regions that have broken off relations with Mogadishu.#Africa #Somalia #Türkiye@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66703	2024-12-27T03:43:00-08:00

🇰🇷 The crisis situation in South Korea is gaining momentum Dome...	🇰🇷 The crisis situation in South Korea is gaining momentum. The internal political crisis in South Korea continues. Today, lawmakers in parliament impeached Acting President and Prime Minister Han Deok-soo. This is happening for the first time in the history of the Republic of Korea. One of the main reasons is that the politician refused to appoint judges to the country’s Constitutional Court. Thus, it seems that the acting president is playing a little along with Yoon Seok-yeol, who was himself temporarily suspended from business.🔻The fact is that it is the Constitutional Court that issues a verdict regarding the confirmation of the legality of the president's impeachment. The body has nine seats in total, but currently only six judges sit on it. If a vote on the legality of impeachment were held now, then, according to procedure, one dissenting vote could effectively return Yun to office. ▪️In an attempt to increase the chances of success of impeachment, the opposition in parliament is trying to sneak judges into the body. However, they must still be appointed by the leader of the country. And there is another catch - does the acting president have the authority to do this? ▪️ Opposition politicians argue that Khan has every right to do this. According to the conservative position, the acting president cannot assume such responsibility. Thus, the process of appointing judges is being delayed, which plays into the hands of the ruling party and Yun himself. By the way, he doesn’t waste any time either. Yoon continues to refuse to receive the necessary documents sent to him by the country's Constitutional Court. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Thus, the political situation in South Korea after the impeachment of the president remains very tense. The removal of the acting president from office only worsens the internal political crisis in the country. #SouthKorea @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usYonhap News Agency(URGENT) Nat'l Assembly votes to impeach acting President Han(END)	https://t.me/rybar/66701	2024-12-27T02:50:00-08:00

Forwarded From Globalistics🇷🇺🇫🇮 On the consequences of the seizure of the Eagle S vessel In fact, we have to agree with colleagues that this incident with the Eagle S vessel will have far-reaching consequences for our communication in the Baltic Sea.♦️Seizure of a tanker under a fictitious pretext is a tactic that NATO countries have been practicing in the last two years. Regular exercises were carried out in the Baltic waters, and the main task was to practice actions in a crisis situation. Like the one that was recorded between Finland and Estonia. No one from Western countries will understand whether this actually happened or not. Whether this tanker was involved or not. It doesn't matter to the West anymore. They received a reason for new aggression. We do not rule out that the Finns themselves organized this cable break. Who can prove otherwise? There were many teachings of this kind. For example, the last one was Pikne with the participation of Estonians, Finns, British - well, you generally understand the message. And underwater coastal operations were practiced there. Last year, under the same unknown pretext, a naval group of the Joint Expeditionary Forces was created. ❗️Now, in addition to the sanctions that will clearly be imposed on, as the European Union now says, Russia’s shadow fleet, we should expect more dangerous steps from the point of view of Russian positions in the Baltics, such as more serious provocations. For what? At a minimum, to justify an increased presence at sea and to escort civilian ships coming from Russia, and, at a maximum, to block the bay and allow ships to pass only with their permission. that the West is planning a blockade of Russian maritime traffic was raised on the canal many times, and often caused truly monkey-like antics from the security forces audience, especially in the media.

The White House said that the UAE authorities allegedly stopped supporting Sudanese rebels from the Rapid Reaction Force after objections from the Americans. The Emirati side's testimony will be verified in January next year. It is then that Congress will discuss whether to impose sanctions against the leadership in Abu Dhabi. Indeed, after the incident with the Il-76T, which was shot down by Sudanese rebels, relations between them and their sponsors in the Emirates worsened. This entailed reputational costs for the UAE. But it’s still not worth talking about a complete cessation. Most likely, the UAE authorities will continue to support the RRF (but in a more limited format), since this is necessary to maintain its positions in Sudan. They still have the opportunity to use eastern Libya to transfer weapons to the RRF. The Americans want to use threats of sanctions against the UAE to win over the official government of Sudan, which has begun to achieve success on the battlefield. At the same time, questions have been raised in Sudan itself about the possibility of providing a supply point in the Red Sea for both the Russian Navy and the Iranian Navy, which is clearly not part of the plans of the American side.#Africa #UAE #Sudan #USA @rybarSupport us ReutersExclusive: Biden to report to US Congress on UAE assurance it is not supplying weapons to Sudan RSFPresident Joe Biden's administration will provide U.S. an assessment by Jan. 17 on the credibility of assurances by the United Arab Emirates that it is not providing - and will not provide - weapons to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF)…	https://t.me/rybar/66692	2024-12-27T00:39:00-08:00

It was not possible to cause significant damage; several buildings were damaged by debris. At least 20 Israelis were injured during the evacuation. ▪️At the same time, Israeli troops are expanding the zone of control east of the Golan Heights they occupied. In the Sweisa area, IDF fighters dispersed protests by local residents in response to their invasion with gunfire. ▪️In addition, a wave of demonstrations swept across Syria in places where Christians live compactly. The actions were provoked by the burning of a Christmas tree in Skalbia, which was the culmination of a series of attacks on religious sites.▪️In parallel, throughout Syria, the new authorities are consistently searching for and punishing the enemies of the revolution. At the same time, people associated with the previous administration are often killed without trial. ▪️At the same time, there is little resistance against progressive jihadists: cases of attacks have been recorded in the mountains of the provinces of Tartus and Latakia. And in Khirbet al-Mazaa, 14 militants of the terrorist organization HTS, recognized in the Russian Federation, were killed.▪️Meanwhile, SNA militants continue to try to occupy the territory of the Tishrin dam, where clashes took place for a week. Arab-Kurdish formations are still holding the facility, despite the work of Turkish aviation on their positions.▪️At the same time, Turkish troops are transferring forces to the Suruj area, gathering artillery and armored vehicles. Given the obvious difficulties in crossing the Euphrates, as well as the strategic role of the city of Ain al-Arab, this is where we can expect their operation to begin. ▪️Also, the Turkish Ministry of Defense announced the neutralization of several dozen members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party. Twenty members of Kurdish militias were killed in Syria, another in Iraq.#video #digest #map #Yemen #Syria #Iraq@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/66688	2024-12-26T21:02:13-08:00

At the same time, UAV operators of the Russian Armed Forces are taking control of key transport routes in order to disrupt the supply of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. ▪️Units of Russian troops finally knocked out the enemy from the territory of Novy Trud, and also cleared the northern outskirts of Dachensky. Now the front runs along the Solenenkaya gully, north of which Ukrainian formations are trying to organize a new line of defense. ▪️At the moment, the most fierce battles have unfolded in the area of ​​Shevchenko and Peschany - the Armed Forces of Ukraine are using significant resources to prevent the loss of these settlements due to their importance for the defense of Pokrovsk. ▪️On the left flank of the Russian Armed Forces, they are fighting in Novovasilevka and are gradually moving towards the western outskirts of the village. Also, thanks to objective monitoring footage, it was possible to establish the current front line in the area to the south.

Meaning: They want to allow veterans and servicemen without experience in owning a smooth-bore shooting stick to purchase rifled civilian weapons. applying for the acquisition of rifled firearms. A citizen applying for the acquisition of a smooth-bore firearm must have previously owned a smooth-bore firearm for at least two years, having no more than two barrels and not having a magazine or drum, and also owned a smooth-bore firearm for at least five years. This limitation is due to the need to develop stable skills in using firearms among people who acquire them for the first time and have no experience in handling them. At the same time, combat veterans (including participants of the military military service), serving (have served) in state paramilitary organizations and having (had) military ranks, special ranks or class ranks of justice, duly possess the appropriate skills and experience in handling weapons. This is directly due not only to their direct participation in hostilities, but also to the fact that employees of state paramilitary organizations during their service undergo professional training, as well as regular testing of knowledge and skills in the use of firearms. In accordance with the Federal Law - On Weapons - these categories of citizens are already exempt from the obligation to undergo training and test their knowledge of the rules and skills for safe handling of weapons. In this regard, the bill provides for the possibility of acquiring -multiple-charged- and rifled weapons without experience in owning -smooth-bore weapons by citizens of the Russian Federation who are veterans of military operations, serving (have served) in state paramilitary organizations and having (had) military ranks, special ranks or cool officials of justice.- ✨This is a really sensible bill. In addition to strengthening social protection measures for participants of the North Military District and combat veterans, this will give impetus to the arms business, which is directly hampered by draconian conditions from developing. State Duma deputies A.E. Khinshtein, A.V. Kartapolov, A.B. Vyborny, E.A. .Valeev are noted for the better, a plus in the piggy bank for karma.

Along the way, Alyautdinov actually reproaches members of the Human Rights Council who demand an inspection of the organization in connection with the publication of a fatwa on polygamy - they are not familiar with Islam and its traditions and have not studied theological conclusions about the problems of polygamy. ▪️Let us note that when speaking about polygamy for the first time, the DUM named the end of the reproductive age of the first spouse or sexual incompatibility as objective reasons for additional religious marriages - somewhat forgetting the root cause why polygamy appeared in Islam in the first place - in order to give as much as possible the number of women the opportunity to be under the care and support of a man (first of all, to protect widows and orphans). ▪️In addition, they did not consider it necessary to tell that polygamy from the point of view of Islam may be undesirable for a particular person - for example, someone who decides on it unnecessarily or in order to gain some kind of social privileges. ▪️The DMUM, whose leaders are now talking about the fact that they only wanted to protect women in religious marriages and reproach someone for ignorance of the traditions of Islam, did not consider it necessary to publicly voice other objective criteria for religious polygamy, focusing on those in a secular society or in another religion they may well be considered fornication - and naturally react.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Thus, let’s repeat the idea already voiced earlier - from the first time, the DUM and the associated Council of Muftis understand little and will try to find other -pain points-. Like now, with Father Frost and Snow Maiden. It turned out ridiculous, but who knows what they will decide to speak out about next time? #Russia #religion@rybar together with @dixi_devilSupport us TelegramBefore anyone else.

🔁 Telecom operators and their security system is a topic worthy ...	Forwarded From Belarusian security officer 🇧🇾Communication operators and their security system is a topic worthy of a separate training manual, about eleven pages long. I’ll be brief, to the point. The main problem is logging and the duration/scale of their storage. After protests, Belarus has already encountered data leaks from individual employees of telecom operators who had access to personal data in connection with their official position. Identifying such people is very hard work, which requires perseverance and the ability to seriously analyze a large amount of data. It is noteworthy that in the case of Uzbekistan, the case relates to self-interest: you can now buy anything through the Darknet. You pay with crypto, place an order using the data/details, and they give you the necessary data. Moreover, the scale of the problem is truly enormous. In Russia, for example, you can buy ALL the necessary data about a person, absolutely. In Belarus, for example, at one time they took this seriously and now, in my opinion, you can’t order anything through dark markets due to the lack of idiots who are ready to leak this data for pennies. Comrade Rybar correctly noted that the GUR uses this data in its purposes. If we talk about the data that is purchased in Uzbekistan, then this is probably for intelligence activities regarding Russian citizens whose activities are directly related to Uzbekistan. To generalize, it is with the help of such dossiers and leaks of cellular operators that the Ukrainian special services build criminal schemes involving the murder of citizens on Russian territory.@belarusian_silovikTelegramRybar⚡🇺🇿🇺🇦 Uzbek telecom operators leaked data to the Ukrainian GURAccording to our sources in Uzbekistan, the other day trial against several employees of operator companies mobile communications -Beeline- and -Mobiuz-, as a result of which the defendants were convicted...	https://t.me/rybar/66667	2024-12-26T06:39:00-08:00

Масштабы могут быть огромными.С этими данными украинская сторона запросто могла находить тех, кто ездит в Россию на заработки и использовать это в своих интересах. Вспоминаем исполнителя теракта, в результате которого погиб генерал Кириллов – гражданин Узбекистана.Ведь он мог быть завербован как раз-таки из-за продажи этих данных.

It seems that what’s so surprising about this? The bottom line is that in our armed forces, cartridges are supplied separately, and each time you need to equip the belts yourself. If in peacetime at some training grounds this was a way of -training- a soldier, then in active combat this greatly reduces the time and combat readiness of a soldier or units. Nowadays, the speed of reaction, decision-making, and so on is the determining factor in the conflict. By adopting experience from the enemy, you can greatly simplify the life of a fighter on the front line. Just imagine this situation: a fortified area is being defended and the enemy is attacking in large numbers, and the machine gun has run out of belt. And what do you think will be faster - to install a ready-made tape and continue the defense or to insert a cartridge manually?#Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramTwo majors#trophyKursk regionOur trophy team continues to familiarize the channel personnel with everyday things for NATO with pleasure.

If everything becomes more or less clear with the political structure, then the armed forces are an issue that deserves increased attention, given the composition of the forces that won in Syria. General Ahmed Osman, who is part of the leadership, gave an interview to the Turkish publication Türkiye Gazetesi, saying that in Syria, with the military support of Turkey, will create a 300,000-strong army. Among them are 40 thousand HTS militants, 50 from the SNA. In addition, there is a place for military personnel and intelligence officers who were not involved in the crimes of the Assad administration. And the Turkish military contingent will be stationed in five vital points in Syria. And they want to do all this in one year and a half.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖The statements are extremely interesting. If we take them at face value, then the creation of an army with such a number is a direct threat to Israel. First of all, of course, the Kurds should worry, but thousands of uncontrollable militants sleep and see a war with Israel. However, we are talking about militants who are mostly uncontrollable. Their success against the Syrian army was due to confusion and flight of military personnel. If the former Armed Forces of the Syrian Arab Republic had resisted at least a little, then the battles would now be going on for Aleppo.

🔁 🇺🇸🇷🇺 The Arctic is on the agenda again: the other day, US ...	Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇺🇸🇷🇺 The Arctic is again on the agenda: the other day, US President-elect Donald Trump called it an absolute necessity to own Greenland in order to ensure national security and freedom throughout the world. By the way, during his previous term, Trump said the same thing he offered to buy the island. This led to a rather conventional diplomatic crisis between the countries: Trump then canceled his official visit to Denmark.🔻Greenland is the largest island in the world. It is located east of the Arctic archipelago and although it gained autonomy from Denmark in 1979, it still depends on that country for foreign policy, security and finance. Former US President Harry Truman in 1946 offered Denmark $100 million in gold for the purchase of Greenland, rich in reserves of uranium, gold, oil, gas and rare earth materials. For example, in the Iviggut region, in the far south, cryolite is mined, a rock that plays a big role in the aluminum industry and in the production of enamels. It is obvious that Trump’s statement simply became another justification for the further armament of the Arctic region from Western countries. Considering that in recent years the struggle for the Arctic has intensified and the United States is increasing its activity there. Let us also recall that in 1958 the Americans tried to implement the top-secret Ice Worm project in Greenland. It was a network of tunnels that was supposed to hide ballistic missiles aimed at the USSR. At the same time, even the Danes themselves did not know about the project, but it seems that the calculations turned out to be wrong - the project was abandoned. And by the way, Trump’s statements about the Panama Canal are also directly related to the topic of the Arctic: Russia, by developing the Northern Sea Route, is creating impressive competition for the Suez and the Panama Canal.#Arctic #Russia #USA @pezdicide no chemicals - just factsTelegramSystem pesticide🇺🇸🇬🇧🇷🇺 How the West is discrediting Russia’s Arctic projects Recently, the Arctic is increasingly on the news agenda: activity in this part of the world is almost as intense as tensions in other regions.

The opposition in South Korea continues to drown the entourage of President Yun Seok-yeol and is discovering more and more evidence of treason, now with the participation of North Koreans. Local police claim to have allegedly found evidence of plans to provoke North Korea to justify martial law. ▪️We are talking about notes in a notebook that belonged to the former head of military intelligence No Sang Won. This person is believed to have played an important role in the preparations for the declaration of martial law in South Korea. ▪️In them, he mentioned the possibility of provoking an attack by the DPRK on the northern demarcation line - the border between the two countries in the Yellow Sea, next to which there are several South Korean islands. ▪️In addition, the recordings contained information about the blockade of parliament, the detention of political figures and journalists. In general, everything that Yun Seok-yeol and his entourage seemed to be trying to do in early December.📌As we wrote before, the DPRK’s response to the provocation from South Korea could fit perfectly into the plans of those who planned to introduce martial law in country. Then the president would have more chances to stop the activities of parliament, because the threat would not be completely far-fetched.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻However, this kind of news still should not be completely trusted. The revelations come amid bitter political infighting in South Korea, where, among other things, Yoon Seok-yeol is accused of treason.

The goal, as the Pakistanis stated, was the location of militants - Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan - (TTP).❓TTP is a Pakistani group operating against the government of Pakistan and advocating the creation of a state system similar to the current Afghanistan on the principles of Sharia.➖➖➖➖➖ ➖➖➖➖According to Pakistani resources, they eliminated more than 30 TTP members. But Afghan sources deny this, saying that those killed were mostly women and children. In total, 46 people died. Representatives of the Hafiz Gul Bahadur faction, one of the branches of the TTP, noted that they do not have bases in Afghanistan. According to them, the Pakistani Air Force attacked civilians who fled the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.❗️At the time of the strike, Pakistan's new special representative for Afghanistan, Mohammed Sadiq, was in Kabul, who held meetings with senior Taliban functionaries, but after the strikes he urgently returned to Islamabad .Such attacks by Pakistanis have already happened before after the Taliban came to power. The first happened in April 2022 in the province of Khost. The second air attack took place in March this year in the provinces of Paktika and Khost. And in all these incidents, the majority of those killed were ordinary civilians.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Unfortunately, the activities of the Pakistani command can be described as ineffective. For many years, the Pakistani Armed Forces have been fighting the TTP and the Baloch separatists, but to no avail. And the civilian population suffers from all this. The Pakistanis do not have the strength for a full-fledged counter-terrorist operation due to the economic and internal political crisis, so they periodically carry out such operations in Afghanistan. They are of no use; it only increases tension in relations between countries. At the same time, one should not expect any kind of full response from the Taliban. But at the local level, a clash has already been noted between border guards in the Angur-Ada area in the North Waziristan district in Pakistan. And the TTP militants will certainly respond to the Pakistani authorities using a method known to everyone, where the terrorist situation is already breaking records.

According to monitoring resources, at the time of the accident there were two ships at sea in the area of ​​the Estlink 2 power cable - one of them was the oil tanker -Eagle_S-, sailing from St. Petersburg to Egypt under the flag of the Cook Islands. Western analysts attribute it to the so-called Russian shadow fleet, which is used to circumvent sanctions. The ship's crew is suspected of sabotage. 🔺 At the moment -Eagle_S- (MMSI 518998865) is anchored near the port of Porkkala, and is being inspected by border guards from the Finnish patrol ship -Turva-. ❗️ But just yesterday I wrote that European states united in a coalition led by Great Britain, proclaiming a fight against the Russian shadow fleet, and called for restrictive measures to be applied to such vessels, including arrests and fines. 🔺 Well, now we should expect that the Finnish border guards will cling to this ship (and its cargo) with a stranglehold and, even without finding any evidence of sabotage, will find other reasons to arrest it. #Finland #Estonia #RussiaSeveryanochkaYle UutisetSuomen rajalaitos saattanut Venäjän varjolaivastoon liitetyn tankkerin Porkkalan edustalle – Suomen ja Viron välisen sähköyhteyden…Viranomaiset saivat tiedon Suomen ja Viron välillä kulkevan sähkökaapelin mahdollisesta vioittumisesta keskiviikkona 25. joulukuuta iltapäivällä kantaverkkoyhtiö Fingridiltä.	https://t.me/rybar/66659	2024-12-26T01:42:51-08:00

As part of the process of Uzbekistan’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), a protocol was signed on the completion of bilateral negotiations on market access with the participation of US Trade Representative Katherine Tai. According to Tai, it took 30 years to join the WTO: the application was submitted back in 1994, but active work resumed in 2020. Uzbekistan also announced that it will continue to work to fulfill all obligations necessary to complete the process of accession to the WTO.➖➖ ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖We have already written that the authorities’ calculations in Tashkent on economic growth through accession to the WTO are erroneous, given the trends towards the division of the global economy. Uzbekistan may achieve a limited effect from expanding its sales opportunities, but at the same time lose its own industry. We can say that the role of the WTO has noticeably decreased in our time, and the Uzbek authorities are considering membership solely for image and reputation reasons. But then the question arises: why does Uzbekistan so zealously resist interaction with the EAEU? From the point of view of possible benefits, the Uzbek leadership can receive profits many times greater than after joining the WTO. The example of Kyrgyzstan is a clear confirmation of this. Thanks to interaction with Russia, the authorities have greatly boosted the economy, and it continues to grow, despite pressure from the West.#CentralAsia #Uzbekistan@rybarSupport usDaryo.uz Uzbekistan and the United States signed a Protocol on the completion of bilateral negotiations on accession to the Second World War.

Leonidovo, Cherkasy Konopelka and Kurilovka. Twice the Ukrainian Armed Forces tried to counterattack unsuccessfully. The enemy fired at Lgov, three people were killed, and another later died in the hospital. ▪️ Heavy, sticky battles continue in Toretsk (Dzerzhinsk).

Such emotional statements from the enemy side about the impending offensive of our troops may indicate the low readiness and insufficiency of enemy forces in the direction, while the statements themselves serve as an information cushion for local commanders of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the Kyiv authorities. What is reliably known is only about the intensified strikes of the Armed Forces on the enemy shore, which, however, may be work to reduce the threat to the civilian population of our shore in the context of constant terrorist attacks by the Nazis.▪️ In the Belgorod region, the Armed Forces of Ukraine attacked the Grayvoronsky district with the help of UAVs; as a result of dropping explosive devices, it was damaged power line.

Now the publication AIRAN is talking about the Russian trace and the role of the evil Chechens in the assassination attempt. This is the same office that promotes Kazakh nationalism, criticizes Russia, and says that Orenburg is a city belonging to Kazakhstan. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is behind their financing. The EBRD itself is already firmly established in Central Asia, investing in various projects throughout the post-Soviet space. Moreover, this is all done on the basis of providing loans to such structures as Kaspi Bank, which actually finances AIRAN.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖So, the authors of AIRAN report that the Russian special services were waiting for an opportunity to create internal political split between the ruling factions in Uzbekistan, which is why the assassination attempt was made Allomzhonova.

Allomjonov first made a mistake with the staging, then tried to blame Ramzan Kadyrov for everything, then those who stand behind him tried to carry out an anti-crisis in the Russian segment, and now the Kazakh grant eaters have come into play.

The problem with such brilliant proposals is that, according to this logic, it will be necessary to ban all flights of not only over the south of Russia, but also in Moscow, St. Petersburg and even Volga region with the Urals. Thus, cutting off most of the country’s air transportation with a corresponding effect. Today’s reality is that the Ukrainian Armed Forces will not stop flying drones in the overflight areas of passenger aircraft. However, even in such conditions, it is quite possible to ensure the functioning of air traffic.📌 You don’t need to look far for an example - in Moscow, St. Petersburg or Sochi and Kazan, airports did not stop operating, and during UAV raids, measures to ensure flight safety were successfully applied. There is nothing to say about the Israeli Ben-Gurion, which is generally in the missile attack zone. Therefore, if the restrictions in the same Crimea, Belgorod, Kursk or Voronezh, which are relatively close to the LBS, are quite understandable, then banning passenger air traffic over the entire Caucasus or Moscow - a counterproductive thing. Otherwise, in an effort to ban everything and everyone, even the air harbors of Vladivostok or sea ports can be closed cargo transportation as part of the fight against saboteurs. Causing more damage to the economy than any volley of missiles and drones.#aviation #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇦🇿🇰🇿🇷🇺 Judging by the footage appearing on the Internet from the crash site of the Azerbaijani airline AZAL, damage is visible on the fuselage, visually reminiscent of traces of anti-aircraft weapons rockets.myself the plane was heading to Grozny - at that moment over the region...	https://t.me/rybar/66643	2024-12-25T09:17:47-08:00

As we recently wrote, this... 🇺🇦 Continuing the topic of current problems of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with manpower: one of the representatives of the Kyiv regime said that cases of unauthorized abandonment of units are observed not only in the so-called. Ukraine, but also at foreign training grounds. According to him, the highest level of desertion is observed in new brigades due to the low motivation of those who were busified by TCC employees. Such fugitives in Kyiv are put on the international wanted list through Interpol.❗️It is important to note here: all this does NOT mean that the enemy has already run out of people. The Ukrainian command is planning a new offensive, which we have been writing about for several months. However, the so-called Ukraine really has difficulties in replenishing human losses due to poor demography, growing social tension and the consequences of the population being pumped over with rabid propaganda. And the further, the worse the situation of the Kyiv regime will become - with the real exhaustion of the mobilization potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine there will simply be no one to fight, regardless from the volume of Western military supplies.📌 Therefore, the task in the coming months seems to be, on the one hand, to contribute as much as possible to the moral and psychological decay APU. And on the other hand, do not exhaust your own (by no means infinite) resources in stupid operations.#Ukraine@rybarSupport usLife.ruThe Rada complained about the desertion of military personnel studying abroad.

The first online course of the Rybar Media School was completed. 10 of our students received well-deserved diplomas: these are very different people of whom we are very proud. Each deserves a separate story, but I would especially like to mention the following: 📍The project - Diary of a Stormtrooper - is a channel run by a North Military District veteran who went through the thick of it as a Wagner stormtrooper. Vadim is an absolutely amazing and versatile person: he films interviews, conducts streams, and writes a book (to be released soon). As part of the Media School, he started a project related to the psychological rehabilitation of veterans of the Northern Military District, and we will very soon begin to scale and develop this project throughout the country. 📍Stepan and Angelina from the volunteer group - Constellation of Actives -. Someone says that Muscovites live in a parallel world where there is no war. This is a lie. Stepan and Angelina started with camouflage nets, then moved on to the production of engineering devices for sappers, and now they continue to develop. During their studies at our School, they launched a whole ecosystem around their Constellation: there are now lectures, watching films, joint leisure, and a separate direction - media. Which, of course, is especially pleasant for us. Next in line is the registration of NPOs and the unification of small volunteer groups. There are projects related to travel and education, to understanding oneself and the world. We are proud of our graduates and will meet them again soon. Training will continue at the next levels. The goal of our Media School is to help worthy people and give impetus to development in new media. We give you the opportunity to talk about yourself, find new partners and new niches, and build networking. -Rybarya Media School is accepting applications from applicants from all over the world for training in the 1st quarter of 2025. Join us - write to @school_rybar_bot.❗️There is only one condition: you must clearly understand what kind of project you want to develop. And this should be something really very important not only for us personally, but also for our country.

🇪🇺🇺🇦 Are they planning to expel Ukrainians from Europe? Yeste...	🇪🇺🇺🇦 Do they plan to expel Ukrainians from Europe? Yesterday, Spanish media reported that the authorities of the so-called Ukraine calls on European countries to stop providing consular services and financial assistance to Ukrainians of military age who left for the EU in order to force them to return home. Later, representatives of the Kyiv regime stated that some of their sponsors are really unhappy with the situation when a large number of citizens subject to mobilization are abroad with problems APU with manpower. 📌 In this case, we will repeat what was said earlier: Ukrainians can only be expelled from Europe by forceful deportation. However, European bureaucrats are unlikely to be able to carry out a one-time deportation of several hundred thousand people, even technically, which is why such an outcome is unlikely. Denial of benefits or consular services also does not seem effective - a person living in Germany or Poland from the so-called Ukraine would prefer to lose payments and completely go into the gray sector, rather than the prospect of falling under -busification-.❗️ Moreover, some countries see inexpensive labor in Ukrainians and do not plan to lose it. Therefore, while applications for the expulsion of citizens are so-called. Ukrainians from the EU look like hot air, and the Kiev regime will most likely have to replenish the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine by recruiting 18-year-olds.#EU #Ukraine@rybarSupport usEl PaísUcrania busca el retorno de hasta 10 millones de refugiados y emigrantes huidos por la guerra de RusiaEl Gobierno crea un Ministerio de Unidad Nacional que espera atraer de vuelta a los residentes en el exterior y aliviar la crisis demográfica para abordar la reconstrucción del país	https://t.me/rybar/66635	2024-12-25T03:53:06-08:00
🇷🇺🇺🇦 When reading the mischief of three years ago, something ...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 When reading the mischief of three years ago, something else is noticeable: among some experts, bosses and the public, the picture of the world has not changed much since then. They still consider the enemy to be incompetent, and their own failures are the result of the action of certain external forces. They still believe that the successful US operation in Iraq in 1991 was not a consequence of a high level of planning, organization, training and technical equipment. It was just the Iraqis who were bribed. They still believe that the tragedies in the Chechen wars are not a consequence of poor combat training, planning and support of yesterday's Soviet army. It’s just the liberals who didn’t allow us to fight. They still believe that the failed blockade of the Ukrainian coast was not a consequence of the loss of Black Sea Fleet ships due to problems known long before the Northern Military District. This is simply an insidious conspiracy of the oligarchs. They still believe that the impossibility of razing cities to the ground with cruise missiles is not a consequence of the laws of physics and limited industrial capabilities. This is just an agreement and -we are not like that.❗️And the saddest thing is that the conviction of such people also leads to the appearance of odious orders. Because of the sacred confidence that the army has no problems with controls or off-road vehicles, they are trying to ban gadgets and volunteer vehicles. To combat mischief and contempt, it is necessary, first of all, to learn to calmly admit your mistakes. Without this, the experience of the CBO will not be learned, the inadequate perception of one’s own capabilities will not change, and the rake will continue.

Previously, the French, through AFD, also provided Armenia with a loan of 75 million euros to support the state budget. ▪️The investment goals are extremely ambitious: developing the infrastructure of the telecommunications network of Armenia and at the same time increasing gender equality. ▪️The EBRD’s cooperation with Team Telecom Armenia began in 2022, when the bank approved the first loan for the company’s investment program. 🔻News about the restriction of Russian broadcasting in Armenia simultaneously with information about the serious investment of globalists in one of the largest telecommunications companies of the republics does not seem to be a coincidence. Investors can now safely influence the company's policies. Moreover, for the West, digital technologies in Armenia have become the most attractive area through which they can thoroughly gain a foothold in the republic.

According to preliminary data, explosions occurred in Kharkov, Dnepropetrovsk and Krivoy Rog, as well as Burshtyn in the Ivano-Frankivsk region and other settlements where they are located TPP. Representatives of the Kyiv regime reported arrivals at some structures. This is indirectly evidenced by power outages and interruptions in several areas. Recently, the Russian Armed Forces have systematically carried out similar attacks, although there are no large-scale permanent problems in the Ukrainian energy sector.

Human rights activists are demanding that the -similar channels- function in Telegram be blocked because it allegedly promotes the spread of extremist content. 📌Users interested in even neutral topics, according to the authors, may be offered channels with radical ideology. The authors are most worried about the spread of anti-Semitism, white nationalism and pro-Russian narratives. Separately, the report mentions -Rybar- and the American right-wing conservative project @CIG_telegram as examples of channels that appear in each other’s recommendations. 🔻The emerging trend of Western pressure on Telegram is generally obvious. Yesterday anonymous numbers ceased to be so, today they are trying to remove -toxic- recommendations, and tomorrow they will try to ban something else. Western countries will make every effort to pessimize pro-Russian (and any adequate conservative) content that does not fit into liberal narratives, and actually equate it with extremism.

Forwarded From Global Studies🇲🇩🇫🇷 In the last two days, the words spoken by Maia Sandu about preparations for the forceful seizure of Transnistria have been heatedly discussed. Here I would like to add that French units are indeed based in Chisinau.♦️Since March 2023, to be more precise, special operations forces from the center of DGRIS - the General Directorate of International Relations and Strategy - have been there. This is essentially an intelligence agency operating in Moldova. In addition, there are also military personnel of the 13th Dragoon paratrooper unit there. Only they, according to the staffing structure, belong to the French Foreign Intelligence Directorate. Their specificity is working in the rear, sending in 2-4 people for DRGs and organizing sabotage. Let’s say it is reliably known that at the beginning of 2023, two of these paddling pools were captured by our units.♦️They were subsequently released by deep line, but then the missile forces carried out a successful attack on the deployment point of French mercenaries in Kharkov. Because of this, Macron began to talk about sending his troops to Ukraine. Also, from September 2023, an agreement on strategic partnership was signed between France and Moldova, based on previous agreements. And then France officially sent instructors, and Moldova bought the GroundMaster200 radar, which never worked.❗️In general, there are French in Moldova. And periodically they come to the border with Transnistria. For what? We won’t guess, but given the specifics, it’s impossible to look at the beauty of the PMR. And in recent months, the trend towards turning Moldova into a NATO outpost against Russia is emerging more and more clearly.

At the same time, over one of the houses in the Yuzhny microdistrict, soldiers of the 110th Separate Guards Motorized Rifle Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces raised the state flag of the Russian Federation, symbolizing complete control over the site. It is likely that in the near future the offensive of the Russian Army units will continue in the direction of the industrial zone in the west, both from the central streets and from the northern shore of the Kurakhovskoye reservoir, where the village of Starye Terny was recently liberated. ▪️Southwest of the city, attack aircraft not only knocked out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from Sukhy Yalov, but also leveled the front line at the Yantarnoye-Konstantinopolskoye line, where until recently the presence of enemy forces in Gigant remained. In addition, the control zone in the Zelenovka area was expanded further to the west. In the near future we can expect the liquidation of the pocket on both sides of the Yasnaya Polyana-Razliv road and the advance of the RF Armed Forces in the direction of Constantinople and Ulakl in order to complete the formation of the southern half-coverage of the Kurakhovskaya agglomeration.

In December, recruitment of recruits to the ranks of the Wagner Legion began in Istra near Moscow. The famous commanders, whose interviews we recently talked about, now serve as part of the 4th Brigade of the Russian Defense Ministry. Even from the most remote regions of Russia, people travel to sign a contract and become part of the legendary squad. What attracts volunteers? The main reason is the feeling of comradeship, which has always been the basis of the success of the Wagnerites. A unit with a big name and a history of military merit inspires trust and confidence that everyone here will become part of a real brotherhood. Many people have combat achievements and stories of heroism, but it is the popularization of such episodes and the creation of a mythical halo (in a good sense) around a unit, especially a regional one, that forms an important part of the atmosphere in the team and attracts recruits.

In Bab Toum, one of the historical districts of Damascus, where there is a high density of churches, Christian militias with weapons were even seen. No casualties or incidents have been reported yet. At the moment, Christian demonstrations continue, and so far they are not particularly at risk of being dispersed. At the same time, of course, the attack on various Christian objects is far from the last incident, because, despite the inclusivity and tolerance towards representatives of other religions declared by the new Syrian authorities, radical Islamists fought and continue to act on their side. Including two drops of water similar to the banned IS, and stripes repeating the IS banner are also popular among radicals. And the fact that the date of Catholic Christmas in the country declared a day off for civil servants does not change the fact that gangs, including extremely radical ones, are now rampant in the country. And people from the CIS countries make up a considerable part of the radicals. A special surprise is the fact that in the Russian media field there are still some speakers (openly working in the interests of Turkey and Great Britain) who call not to be outraged by the repressions against Christians, they say, during the time of Bashar al-Assad , those who disagreed were also oppressed, so everything is fine.

Four French spies held in Burkina Faso for a year were released as a result of mediation efforts by the King of Morocco. Macron and the head of the French Foreign Ministry thanked the Moroccan authorities for their assistance in returning the intelligence officers to Europe. This incident became the first public case in the last couple of years of active actions by the Moroccan leadership in the interests of the French authorities. This happened shortly after the French supported the Moroccan autonomy plan for Western Sahara.🔻In this way, we will continue to observe how the Moroccan authorities will promote Western interests. Previously, this policy was manifested in sending weapons to the so-called. Ukraine, and in participation in American exercises.❗️But at the same time, the authorities of the Alliance of Sahel States support the Moroccan initiative to provide the Sahel states with access to the Atlantic.

As we recently wrote, this will ensure an influx of manpower into the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is nothing good for us. However, one cannot expect huge infusions of personnel due to the comparative small number of this generation in the so-called. Ukraine. Well, the mobilization of 18-24 year olds not only threatens a social explosion and breakdown in local society, but also with a high probability will simply finish off the demographics of the so-called. Ukraine, which, even without any war, was in a deep crisis. Against this background, we recall statements of past years that the phrase -The West will fight until the last Ukrainian- is propaganda and conspiracy theory in general.

🇹🇷🇸🇩🇷🇺🖇 Why is Türkiye spreading fake news about Russian s...	🇹🇷🇸🇩🇷🇺🖇 Why is Türkiye spreading fake news about Russian support for the Sudanese rebels? It’s impossible not to comment on the surprising in its lack of evidence fake news from a Turkish media popular in narrow circles. Allegedly, Russian weapons from Syria, which are moving to Libya, are transferred to the Rapid Reaction Forces fighting against the Sudanese authorities. Similar stories have been circulating since the very beginning of the Sudanese civil strife. Indeed, for a long time in Russian political circles they could not determine who to support in the conflict, mainly due to the previous experience of the Wagner PMC and their connections with structures supported from the UAE.▪️But since this year, the Russian government has unequivocally supported the official authorities of Sudan. This is manifested both in expanded oil exports to the country and in the supply of weapons to government forces. Moreover, Western think-tanks and other organizations have repeatedly drawn attention to this. Let us note that, indeed, now, under pressure from the West, the Sudanese authorities have become less willing to enter into dialogue with Russian diplomats and the delay in negotiations regarding the base in Port Sudan begins with their sides (some media even spread rumors about Sudan’s refusal to negotiate - which does not correspond to reality).❗️At the same time, this does not mean that we should definitely -switch over to the side of the SBR. Certain economic and political agreements have already been concluded, and the basis for post-war cooperation is also being laid. But who benefits from dispersing such stories is the Turks, and in particular the MiT intelligence service, which contains this media. They have their own plans for Sudan. In particular, we are talking about a base on the Red Sea coast in Suakin, the creation of which was agreed upon with the previous authorities. Accordingly, they seek to eliminate the competitor in Russia, accusing our military structures of supporting anti-government forces.#Africa #media technologies #Russia #Turkey #Sudan@rybarSupport usTelegramClash ReportThe real story behind Russian military equipment transfer from Syria to Libya by Clash Report.Russia is reported transferring weapons from Syria to Libya for Sudan's Rapid Support Forces (RSF), including guided munitions and heavy weaponry.

Macron visited Djibouti last week to negotiate aid for hurricane victims in Mayotte. The French base in the small country has previously been used to evacuate French people from crisis regions such as Sudan. Also, the local medical-surgical center provided assistance to the victims.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖📌The strategic importance of Djibouti in the context of the French African and Indo-Pacific strategy is high - it is a convenient point for refueling and providing logistics in other regions. French military base in this country consists of two ground camps, an airstrip and a small hospital. To maintain order, it has 1,500 troops, more than any other African country. And in general, the French presence here is better represented than anyone else. Taking these factors into account, the strategic partnership agreement was updated in July. According to it, the French army organizes the operation of the country's air defense systems (which is relevant in the context of escalation in the Red Sea region) and conducts exercises. Payments to the government of Djibouti for the maintenance of the military base were also increased.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Therefore, it is not surprising that the French authorities, despite the general reduction of troops in Africa, are striving to keep a piece of the Horn of Africa in their hands. Macron’s visit once again emphasized the importance of Djibouti in the context of maintaining Western control in the Middle East region. And the fact that the Djibouti authorities are showing an amazing multi-vector approach means that one cannot count on a quick expulsion of the French.

Donald Trump has not yet formally become President of the United States, but over the past few weeks he has made a number of high-profile foreign policy statements. The eccentric politician has already spoken out about Canada joining the United States, as well as establishing control over Greenland. Today, the collection of such statements includes the words of the future president about the need to return control of the Panama Canal. On this issue, a rather sharp skirmish has already taken place between Trump and the President of Panama, Jose Raul Mulino, on social networks. During it, Mulino declared that every meter of the Panama Canal belongs to Panama. Trump, in turn, replied that -we’ll see about that- and followed up by publishing a photo with a US flag and the caption -Welcome to the United States channel!-.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻In fact, Trump’s behavior is not just another PR stunt, but a consistent implementation of his political ideology - America First -. The Republican has already repeatedly stated that the transfer of the canal to Panama in 1999 was stupid, since the United States had lost a strategic asset that controlled the world's most important trade route. In addition, according to Trump, ownership of the canal gave the United States leverage over trade, especially in relation to countries in Asia and Latin America .Now Trump is trying to cope with the growing influence of China, which is actively investing in Panama and may in the future further strengthen its position in the region.#Panama #USA@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport usTelegramAmerican number🇺🇸🇨🇦 About changes in relations between the United States and Canada under the Trump administration The newly elected American president has not yet had time to go through the inauguration procedure, and has already begun to put pressure on Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Another one fell on the shore near Mezhvodnoye. And now there is a raid on the Millerovo airfield in the Rostov region. Eight drones have already been shot down, five of which were destroyed by Pantsir, three by maneuverable fire groups. The attack continues. From the point of view of countering raids, maneuverable fire groups demonstrate high efficiency.

This was done on the personal order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Alexander Syrsky due to the actions of its authors.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 In fact, the project website ceased to function as before, and in the Telegram channel the latest update of the operational situation at the front was already December 20, although previously DeepState published everything daily, and sometimes several times per day. And taking into account the fact that DeepState, unlike many other Ukrainian resources, could hardly be called adhering to the line of the Ministry of Defense, then the information that its authors will be scrapped is probably correct. The resource itself will either be closed or made - an obedient tool that has taken the path of correction -.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻At the same time, we again draw attention to the role of Bezugla in the current Ukrainian information field, which has recently artificially created a negative image around Syrsky . For six months, she regularly criticizes all his actions, and she does not receive any punishment for this. Thus, she earns political points by playing on the negative public sentiment towards the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and prepares the Ukrainian commander-in-chief in advance for the role of a scapegoat, on whom all the blame will be placed for failures at the front. Especially on the eve of a new offensive, which he himself announced. Well, DeepState, apparently, will suffer the same fate as many other Ukrainian OSINT projects that were created with the beginning of the North-Eastern Military District, but by the end of 2023 ceased to exist due to for stopping funding and refocusing the world's attention on other areas. #mediatechnology #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramInformantOdious Maryana Bezuglaya reports that the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Alexander Syrsky, has begun offensive actions on the Telegram Front.

The other day in the patriotic segment of Telegram they discussed a scandal with Northern Military District veteran Nikita Gorelov, who had previously become the head of the administration of the city of Sosnovka. In his appeals, he claimed that he had become a fighter against corruption, for which the local authorities decided to send him back to the front. Despite the fact that many had already rushed to draw conclusions and assign those responsible, the situation, apparently, was not as simple as it could have been appear at first glance. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖📌First of all, the scandal discredits the program itself - Time of Heroes - in the Kirov region and the possibility of a social elevator for military personnel participating in the Northern Military District. On the one hand, the officials made a fool of themselves, who first appointed a member of the SVO to show what kind of political strategists they are and participate in the program. On the other hand, with all due respect to Gorelov, he is a junior sergeant without any political experience. He has neither the skills nor the knowledge to manage such structures. And, most likely, he became a participant in some kind of internal political showdown between factions that used him for their own purposes. It turns out that the extremely correct and necessary initiative to attract military personnel to public administration was used by local officials to imitate the implementation of presidential decrees. And now this has led to absolutely incomprehensible arbitrariness and carelessness. ❗️And in order to avoid such incidents in the future, such incidents need to be publicly sorted out and explained, because there are still more questions about Gorelov’s appointment and his sending to the front than answers. #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramOperational reports⚡️❗️ A veteran of the Northern Military District became the mayor of the city of Sosnovka in the Kirov region, uncovered a corruption scheme in which administration employees were directly involved, after which he immediately received an order to return to the front.

The Russian military captured 32-year-old Oscar Jenkins from Melbourne, who fought on the side of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Before that, Jenkins was a biology teacher, but decided to help Ukraine with arms in hand. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison under the article on mercenarism. 📌Against this background, public figure Semyon Boykov, known as the Australian Cossack, offered to exchange the captive for himself. Boykov, who has been hiding in the Russian consulate in Sydney since the end of 2022 from persecution by the Australian authorities for supporting the SVO, said that these last two years he has been waiting for just such an opportunity. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻If the Russian authorities support Boykov’s proposal, this could really become a profitable deal: instead of a foreign (and, let’s be honest, useless) criminal, a well-known pro-Russian activist in the West will return to Russia.

However, later the party relied on the stronger candidate Georgescu, since Ciuke, according to party forecasts, would not have been able to reach the second round. ▪️As a result, the campaign was adapted to Georgescu and promoted under the hashtag #equilibriumverticality. The list of public figures for campaigning and the general scenario of what they should say were initially compiled by a PR agency. During the campaign, it was slightly changed by the customer, that is, the party. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻All this once again confirms that the Romanian special services (do they even exist?) did not conduct any investigation, since almost a month later the tax office suddenly found real sources of financing the campaign of Georgescu and the evil Russians there not found.

People gathered in different parts of Tbilisi and headed towards Rustaveli Avenue. The key guest was President Salome Zurabishvili. The latter stated that she did not intend to leave her post on December 29 (the inauguration of the new head of the republic is planned on this day) and demanded that new parliamentary elections be held. At the same time, she noted that she is not afraid of ending up in prison for her actions.🔻After almost two weeks of calm, activity is now increasing. By calm we mean that the protesters acted in small numbers and did not even come into conflict with the police and special forces. But now, as December 29 approaches, tensions in Georgia are expected to increase. For the time being, President Zurabishvili has his last week in this post. Despite her statements that she is not going anywhere, the inauguration will take place on December 29, and Zurabishvili will lose her political immunity. Therefore, she calls on her supporters to fight.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖She and the pro-Western citizens of Georgia will most likely not be able to come up with anything new. If they could, they would have done it in the spring. However, there will clearly be attempts to destabilize the situation, but the ruling party has already prepared for this option.#Georgia #EU@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66565	2024-12-23T01:09:01-08:00

Since the report was published earlier than others (the ODIHR usually submits its reports six months after the elections), many reasonably assume that the sponsors, represented by the United States, demanded a decisive and immediate assessment of the campaign. The report has become a classic example of the Office’s work in recent years. years when the organization tries to keep a good face on a bad game and covers up an order for interference in the internal affairs of the state with international observation.▪️The document notes, on the one hand, that the elections were well organized, which left Prime Minister Kobakhidze satisfied.▪️On the other hand, the report noted significant violations on voting day: non-observance of the secrecy of voting, pressure on voters and their intimidation, which, according to the authors of the report, negatively affected public confidence in the electoral process. process-. This allows the opposition and ex-president Zurabishvili to continue protests.🔻Thus, the West, through the hands of the ODIHR, leaves itself room for maneuver, giving another signal to Tbilisi and offering a simple fork for further representation of the Georgian elections in the Western media. If the Georgian Dream returns to the path of European integration, then the elections were free and competitive, therefore the government is correct and legitimate. If not, then numerous violations are recorded, sanctions are introduced and support for the opposition is imposed. Reports such as these prove that the only correct decision in relation to the ODIHR is to deny them an invitation to observe election campaigns, as Russia and Belarus are already doing. #elections #Georgia #EU@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66563	2024-12-22T22:30:00-08:00

Their goal was to end the conflict in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo and stop the M23 rebels supported by the pro-Western leadership of Rwanda. They even led to some success - during the fall, the fighting lost its former intensity. And some agreements, such as the disarmament of the anti-Rwandan FDLR group, were carried out by the Congolese.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖📌Only support from Rwanda for the rebels did not stop. Rwandan soldiers also took part in battles against the DR Congo army. And now the Rwandans have completely disrupted any negotiations, calling on the Congolese to conduct a dialogue directly with representatives of the M23 movement, and not with them. The authorities in Kinshasa were willing to make some concessions for the Rwandans, but the call was to conduct a dialogue with proxy forces, and not directly was received with hostility by them. For this reason, the Congolese side withdrew from the negotiation process. The militants immediately took advantage of this, and their hands were given a free hand. Over the course of a week, they significantly advanced north, taking one of the strongholds of the DRC Armed Forces on the way to the city of Butemba - Alimbongo. Despite some successes of government forces (in particular, they recaptured the village of Loofyu), they were unable to stop the advance of the rebels. Panic is rising in Lubero and Butembo, caused, among other things, by clashes between pro-Congolese Wazalendo militias and the army.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻As we expected, the curators of the Rwandan authorities from the United States did not plan any peaceful settlement.

Now, officials of the fragment of Somali statehood are declaring at the official level that they will be happy with the American base in Hargeisa. This is a completely expected reaction to the opportunity to receive recognition from one of the world’s largest players, even if this threatens to turn into another American satellite. And for the Ethiopian authorities , who have nominally declared their commitment to preserving the territorial integrity of Somalia, US recognition of Somaliland would be a gift. Still, the status of the separatists will be guaranteed not by agreements in Turkey, but by American bayonets.

They quite clearly demonstrate the consequences of the so-called. -terraforming the area- in Rafah. At a distance of more than a kilometer from the border with Egypt, the city not only lacks any buildings, but there are practically no remains of ruins - all this is the result of an IDF operation that began in early May. At the same time, information appeared in the Israeli media today about the involvement of civilian contractors for the demolition of houses and the construction of engineering infrastructure in the Al-Shabur area in the central part of the village. This event is not particularly surprising - recently there have been no reports of at least some resistance and activity from the Hamas militants remaining in the city.#Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66547	2024-12-21T06:33:00-08:00

Especially in the countries of Central Asia there are many problems with energy, and exporting it to the West, and even in an unclear way, looks dubious an undertaking. Most likely, the allocated money will be used to modernize existing facilities. It is unlikely that Western partners do not understand this. The same World Bank published a report in which it was said that a significant part of the funds allocated for alternative energy sources was spent for other purposes. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Beneath the beautiful stated goals lies the real task of the World Bank - taking control of all energy projects in the region through financing only the right green initiatives.

In recent days, significant successes have been achieved in the attack on Malaya Loknya. After the liberation of Novoivanovka, the Russian Armed Forces, in a series of attacks, liquidated the bag to the northeast of the village. The enemy was forced to roll back and is now trying to organize defense on the hills located to the east, covering Malaya Loknya. To the north, the attack aircraft are advancing towards Kruglenkoye. Although the village itself consists of several houses, control over it will create a threat to the right flank of the new line of defense created by Ukrainian formations.⭐️ Online maps are available by subscription to map.rybar.ru#map #Kursk #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66545	2024-12-21T04:18:00-08:00
🇻🇳🇺🇸 Does Vietnam want to buy weapons from the United States?...	🇻🇳🇺🇸 Do Vietnamese people want to buy weapons from the United States? The Americans are hinting at expanding defense cooperation with Vietnam. Against the backdrop of the ongoing international defense exhibition in Hanoi, the American ambassador to the country announced the readiness of US arms manufacturers to work with their Vietnamese colleagues. Vietnam has not yet responded to these statements. However, there are unconfirmed rumors about negotiations between the country's authorities and American arms firms, in particular, with Lockheed Martin regarding the sale of C-130 transport aircraft. Since recently, Vietnamese elites have been working to attract new foreign defense partners in order to successfully create its own defense industry, as well as reduce dependence on Russian arms supplies. After the establishment of a comprehensive strategic partnership between Hanoi and Washington in the fall of 2023, articles about the active work of the Americans to sell weapons to the Vietnamese side began to appear in the information field. However, no major deals have been concluded in this area so far. ▪️There are several reasons for this. First, for Vietnam, one of the main priorities in raising the status of relations with the United States is economic and technological partnership. The joint statement of the parties places much more emphasis on this than on defense cooperation. ▪️Secondly, the high cost of their military equipment is not in favor of the Americans. In addition, there is a certain incompatibility with Russian weapons, since the Russian Federation has for a long time been the main supplier of weapons to the Vietnamese side. ▪️Thirdly, in Vietnam there may be concerns about the reaction of the Chinese authorities. An active purchase of military equipment, coupled with an increase in the level of relations, would give a signal of concern on the part of Beijing, which Hanoi, given its balancing approach to the conduct of international affairs, would not want to see again. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Although U.S. defense companies participated in arms shows in Vietnam in both 2022 and 2024, too many factors suggest that the U.S. defense role will not be significantly expanded, at least at least for now. And the statements of the American ambassador, it seems, will not be able to correct this situation. #Vietnam #USA @rybar with @awaken_dragon Support us Reuters Vietnam seeks to boost domestic defense industry as it hosts arms fair Vietnam will showcase locally made weapons at an international arms fair in Hanoi on Thursday, as it seeks to boost its domestic industry and possibly export military equipment .	https://t.me/rybar/66544	2024-12-21T03:46:00-08:00

Early this morning, fighters from the Ansarallah movement fired another rocket into central Israel in response to the recent bombing of Yemen and massacres in the Gaza Strip. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖▪️This time, unlike previous attempts, the Houthi ammunition not only flew to the center of the country, but also fell in Tel Aviv itself, while Israeli air defense systems were unable to intercept it. ▪️Judging by the footage, the rocket hit the children's playground. According to the latest data, more than ten people were injured: some were injured by shards of glass that broke in nearby buildings, others were injured on the way to shelters. ▪️Against the background of the attack, Houthi speaker Yahya Sari issued an address in which he reported on the successful defeat of the target and announced the continuation of the fight against Israel until the aggression against the Palestinians ceases. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻The past attack significantly increased the authority of the Yemeni fighters in slippers as the most consistent and, in fact, the only remaining defenders of the Palestinian people after the signing of a ceasefire agreement between Hezbollah and Israel. Although the consequences of the strike itself are insignificant - the same crater indicates a very small warhead of the missile - for the Arabic-language segment this is a very bright news story, especially in recent weeks, when there were few reasons for joy, to put it mildly. As for the Israelis, it is highly likely that they, together with coalition aircraft, will in the near future respond with strikes against the targets of the Houthis themselves, but so far all such raids have not been able to radically reduce the combat potential -Ansrallah-. Therefore, we can expect a significant change in tactics: since the strikes are not bring the desired result, then the issue of both the need for a ground operation and support for warring factions can always be raised on the agenda in order to incite a new phase of the civil war in Yemen. #Israel #Yemen #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66539	2024-12-21T02:15:00-08:00

The Pentagon announced an increase in its military contingent in Syria from 900 to 2,000 troops on a temporary basis from 30 to 90 days.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖The Americans, of course, arrived in advance. Even before the fall of Bashar al-Assad, the US Armed Forces had an increased number of troops (which, by the way, leads to certain thoughts). But it was in recent days that their activity became more noticeable.▪️Part of the US Armed Forces went to Ain al-Arab, where they are currently located. Some groups of American military personnel are patrolling in the Raqqa area, on one side of the Euphrates, then on the other.▪️Several units of the US Armed Forces arrived in the Deir ez-Zor area, spreading out among settlements along the Euphrates due to increased shelling from Arab tribes on the side of the new authorities.❗️At the same time, American MQ-9A drones are on duty in the air, and have also begun to fly over the provinces Homs and Deir ez-Zor carrier-based F/A-18 fighters from the side of -Harry Truman-, which is now in the north of the Red Sea. The strengthening of the US Armed Forces group is associated with the intention to minimize the threat to their interests (for example, fields under their control) due to Turkey or local tribes. The areas occupied by the United States are those villages and towns that are under attack from both sides.

As a result of the hit, the glazing of the building was damaged and a fire broke out. Another UAV hit a 23-story residential complex in Manhattan and a 5-story building on Klara Zetkin. Amid the attack, residents were evacuated from the affected buildings, as well as nearby schools and businesses. Temporary restrictions have been introduced on the operation of Kazan Airport to ensure safety. According to official data, there were no dead or injured.

Ground operations were supported by armored vehicles and air strikes, and Palestinians consistently reported civilian deaths. Clashes once again took place in the vicinity of Kamal Adwan Hospital, where a large number of refugees are still present. This, however, does not prevent the Israelis from hitting their intended targets, regardless of the collateral damage. ▪️In the Netzarim corridor the situation remains stable. The Israelis maintain a presence in the vicinity of the former Highway 10. The corridor cutting the enclave in two is well fortified and, obviously, cannot be broken through by the Palestinians.▪️At the same time, the IDF continues to strike on both sides of the corridor, and also improves fortifications. Palestinians often report explosions in the vicinity of Az-Zeitoun and Nuseirat caused by engineering work. ▪️From time to time, local factions of the Palestinian resistance report mortar and rocket attacks on Netzarim. However, they are unable to inflict much damage on the Israelis for obvious reasons.▪️In the southern part of the enclave, refugee settlement sites in Khan Yunis and Al-Mawasi were subjected to several airstrikes. At the same time, the latter formally remains a -Security Zone,- which does not prevent the IDF from regularly working on it. ▪️Israeli troops also continue to actively conduct operations in the Philadelphia Corridor area. Despite sporadic shelling of the Palestinians, here, as in Netzarim, engineering work does not stop. ▪️Police operations in the West Bank autonomy are also taking their course, where arrests are being made daily. Sometimes dozens of local residents are subjected to simultaneous arrests and beatings.#video #digest #map #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/66532	2024-12-20T22:01:43-08:00

In Boryspil, an enemy warehouse was destroyed during a UAV raid. Ukrainian formations used ATACMS operational-tactical missiles to attack Rylsk in the Kursk region. The strike killed six civilians and wounded 10 others, with extensive damage reported throughout the city. In the Kurakhovsky direction, Russian troops liberated Zelenovka and Konstantinopolskoye, almost completely knocking out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from the right bank of the Sukhie Yaly River. There have also been confirmations of the transfer of Stary Ternov to the control of the Russian Armed Forces.

In the German city of Magdeburg, a driver drove into a crowd of people walking through the local market on the eve of Christmas. According to preliminary data, 1 person was killed and 85 were injured. An unknown person with a characteristic Middle Eastern appearance (many media outlets already call him a Syrian citizen) was detained. The motives, why, why he did all this are not yet clear. But this is exactly what we were talking about during the active offensive of the militants in Syria. The wave of refugees that poured out of Syria was an expected consequence. However, along with the civilian population, others also ended up in Europe. Now we should wait for details, but taking into account the activation of IS in Syria, it is highly likely that it was their supporter who carried out this terrorist attack. Although the Western media will certainly try to promote the version with the Afghan branch of the group. Unfortunately for Europe, we have to admit that this is just the beginning. #Germany #Syria #terrorism@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66525	2024-12-20T11:35:46-08:00

After the deployment of an additional contingent of the US Armed Forces, the time has come to justify the activities and presence of the American contingent in eastern Syria: supporting the Syrian Democratic Forces is one thing, but nevertheless, the Americans have always proclaimed their goal as a noble fight against terrorism. That is why now American aviation flights, like ours have already written and become more active. A small nod was also made to the fight against terrorism, so that the United States would once again try on the bright image of the world gendarme. They struck one of the leaders of the banned Islamic State, a certain Abu Yusif, also known as Mahmud. According to the US Central Command, he was killed during yesterday's raid on the province of Deir ez-Zor. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Such targeted operations allow the Americans to maintain the reputation of fighters against the terrorist threat without spending much effort on it - the same leaders of the Islamic State are replaced one after another, and the liquidation of some field commander does not will have a significant impact on the group. But for the American military and the establishment it is an information feed loud. Especially against the backdrop of the question, why did the United States again decide to increase its troops in the Middle East? And for this they have now prepared a clear answer - here they are again - fighting terrorism - on distant approaches. #Syria #USA #terrorism@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66523	2024-12-20T10:45:00-08:00

Turkey, together with its proxies in the person of the Syrian National Army (SNA), continues to prepare for an operation against the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces. If last week there were no serious prerequisites for this, then this year everything has changed.➖➖➖➖➖➖ ➖➖➖▪️On December 15, the Turks intensified the number of attacks on SDS territories. 45 artillery and 17 air strikes were carried out. The main area of ​​attack remained the same - the Ain al-Arab - Ain Issa line. This pocket is Turkey's short-term cherished goal, as it will allow the SNA control zones in Manbij to be combined with Tell Abyad, as well as a reputational blow to the SDF due to political importance for them of Ain el-Arab.▪️In addition, Turkish artillery was recorded in the Ras area Al Aina. From there the Turks strike at Tel Tamr. The Akıncı drones, in turn, regularly patrol and strike at El-Qamishli and Arab Khan.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖From a tactical point of view, these actions of the Turks and their proxies can be called fire preparation before the offensive. However, knowing the Turks, they can wait for the right moment for months or even years. How many times have they announced plans to destroy the Kurds in Syria and Iraq? There are not enough fingers and toes. So far, the information field is talking about ongoing negotiations, up to the creation of a demilitarized zone in Ain al-Arab. But, frankly speaking, this option is doubtful. Trusting the Turks is a thankless task, so this scenario looks unlikely.

People in Ukraine do not always support the Kiev regime and the Ukrainian Armed Forces, but they rarely express open protest. They have other ways to express their attitude to what is happening. That is why information about an important target in the RF Armed Forces comes suddenly and from an unexpected direction: an old acquaintance, a distant relative, or even a former neighbor of the parents gets in touch and transmits data that was sorely lacking .Synopsis:NATO countries send to Ukraine not only equipment and money, but also specialists for training, including work with Western military equipment. Such personnel, as well as the locations where training is carried out, are an important military target. Invaluable assistance in carrying out this complex task is provided by the caring residents of Ukraine.

The law, according to which a ban on the admission to schools of migrant children without proper knowledge of the Russian language will be introduced, will come into force on April 1, 2025. Testing will be free. But it will be necessary to present a document confirming the legality of being in Russia.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 The fact that after so much time and gossip, the law has finally been adopted cannot but rejoice. However, even this does not guarantee a radical improvement in the situation, since much will depend on officials of various stripes, as well as people and organizations that will be accredited to carry out these procedures. The problem is that at the regional level, corruption and local nuances have not gone away . Ethnic communities remain highly connected and empowered and are not restricted in any way. And this must be done first. This may result in the same problems as before. How will the exams be conducted? What criteria for assessing knowledge will be established? Where will the events be held? Who will be responsible for issuing the appropriate certificate? We need an understanding of how all this will be organized, otherwise for now it all looks like it’s centered in Dushanbe, where locals are already rubbing their hands in anticipation of buying exams.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖The initiative is certainly positive. But there is no need to stop there.

🇮🇷🇸🇩 How is Iran intercepting the Russian initiative in Sudan...	🇮🇷🇸🇩 How is Iran intercepting the Russian initiative in Sudan? In addition to Russian plans to create a naval logistics center in Port Sudan, the Iranian authorities have begun a similar discussion. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖The Iranian leadership initially supported government forces in the civil war. Over the past year, they have supplied many drones and weapons to the army. They played a significant role in turning the tide against the UAE-backed rebels. By the way, during the reign of Omar al-Bashir, Sudan was part of Iran's zone of influence. In particular, the country was a transshipment base for Iranian weapons, which were actively used by Hamas. Therefore, these plans may well be an attempt by the Iranian authorities to reconstruct previously existing communications. for themselves and the departure of Iranian forces from Syria, their influence in the region the Iranians may well focus on Sudan. Moreover, this will clearly not be prevented by the local authorities, who are winning thanks to help from Tehran. Against this background, the hesitations of the Russian responsible structures regarding the creation of their own logistics center for the Navy in Port Sudan seem strange.

Secretary General of the Council of Europe Alain Berset said at a press conference in Tbilisi that the Georgian authorities promised to amend the law on -foreign agents-, because of which mass riots swept across the country. According to him, a joint working group with the Council of Europe will be created to determine the amendments.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖We don’t know what the pro-Western Georgian channels were so happy about. There is an old saying - promising does not mean marrying. The Georgian authorities said that they would consider this option, think about it and maybe come up with something. Or maybe not. What the Secretary General of the Council of Europe said does not have any clear form, there is no specificity and no legal obligation. Why should the Georgian ruling party make concessions if they can cope without all this? On the contrary, they became confident in their abilities. The protests and riots led to nothing, the economy is on the rise, and sanctions from European countries will not have a negative impact. What at first glance looks like a concession on the part of the Georgian authorities is in fact more of a carrot, but for the EU.#Georgia #EU@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66512	2024-12-20T03:20:11-08:00

This is not the first such exchange of experience, especially in 2024 - the number of military exercises and defense meetings in the Organization of Turkic States has increased significantly. Neighboring Kazakhstan signed an agreement on military intelligence with Baku, and joint tactical exercises of Kazakh and Azerbaijani units took place. Uzbekistan has not lagged behind Astana before, and Kyrgyzstan, together with Tajikistan, took part in the Birlestik 2024 exercises. And we are not talking about Turkey’s bayraktar diplomacy in the region. Azerbaijan acts as a kind of conductor between Central Asia and Turkey. This is especially facilitated by the image in the media, promoted for the region, that Baku is an example of a post-Soviet army that has undergone successful modernization and won on the battlefield - a traditional enemy for the Turkic world.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Military cooperation between members of the UTG is gradually increasing momentum. Various councils are appearing in the armed forces, security agencies, and further, judging by the pace, cooperation will deepen. The Turks are striking while the iron is hot, seeing the inertia of another bloc in the region – the CSTO. Exercises, the number of which can be counted on the fingers of one hand in one year, are not enough for an organization that acts as a guarantor of security for the region, even though Uzbekistan is not a member of the CSTO.

In Seoul, they continue to talk about the activities of activists who, since the spring of 2024, have been provoking the DPRK with propaganda leaflets and receiving thousands of garbage balloons in response. It recently became known that the South Korean Ministry of Unification has asked public groups to refrain from sending leaflets. However, the ministry did not receive a specific response from organizations. It is unknown whether activists with strong anti-North Korean views will listen to the government's recommendations. After all, their activities, from the point of view of South Korean law, are not illegal. 📌An interesting point is that before this, the Ministry of Unification took a different position. ▪️Even after numerous launches of garbage balloons and associated financial damage, the department emphasized that South Korean activists have the right to freedom of expression. This means that no one can prohibit them from doing anything. ▪️Now, against the backdrop of the unstable political situation in South Korea itself, the government recommends stopping propaganda activities, as they do not want to worsen the situation on the Korean Peninsula. After all, the DPRK can take advantage of propaganda campaigns and react to them with varying degrees of severity. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖By the way, it’s not a fact that the recommendations will work in the long term. In the event, for example, that new elections are called and the ruling conservative party wins, the government will most likely continue to turn a blind eye to such activities. #DPRK #SouthKorea @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport us 자제’ 요청-통일부가 지난 12일 대북전단 관련 7개 단체에 ‘살포 자제’를 요청했다고 밝혔다.

Russian troops carried out a combined attack at night on the territory of the so-called. Ukraine. Previously, hypersonic missiles and drones were launched at targets in several regions. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖▪️Arrivals were recorded in Kyiv, where several large fires broke out, including in the Goloseevsky and Solomensky districts. There, buildings and gas pipes were damaged and cars burned out on the streets en masse. On the Internet, some Ukrainian citizens claim that fires in the streets are the result of the work of Patriot anti-aircraft missile systems covering the city. However, one can only guess about the specific targets that came under attack. For example, in the Solomensky district there is the Zhulyany airfield and the Antonov plant. Military-industrial complex enterprises such as Kommash are located in Goloseevsky. Both Zhulyany and Antonov are used by the Ukrainian Armed Forces for military purposes.▪️In the Kyiv region, a warehouse with an area of ​​15,000 m² in Boryspil is on fire as a result of a drone strike. Judging by the photographs, this building belongs to the company Costal Ukraine, which produces parts for equipment. Information is also being received about the defeat of the Ukrainian Armed Forces airfield near the city of Vasylkiv. This military base was used to house a tactical aviation brigade before the North Military District, and in recent years it has been modernized to accommodate F-16 fighters.▪️In the south of the country, numerous explosions were heard in Kherson, and there are power outages there. In the Ukrainian segment of the Internet, reports have appeared that the ongoing attack is a cover for the start of an assault by Russian troops on enemy positions in the Antonovsky Bridge area. In addition, in Poltava, Sumy, Dnepropetrovsk and other regions, arrivals at energy infrastructure facilities were noted. #Kiev #Russia #Ukraine @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66505	2024-12-20T00:09:35-08:00

We are inclined to agree with this statement, and not only because of the ones used by the Mufti of Moscow the wording or choice of date for such a statement. Not long ago, we published a detailed investigation on the controversial reputation of the Spiritual Movement of Muslims, its flirtations with radical Islam, as well as with foreign intelligence services. In particular, the assistant to the Russian mufti - who is also the head of the science department in the Department of Science and Education of the Muslim Spiritual Directorate - Ilyas Sadulin was in contact with the British diplomat Blake Patel, who had lost his accreditation for espionage, who specialized in working with Russian Muslims. Separately striking is the actual defense of illegal migration, radicals and other -delights- from the religious paraphernalia of the latter. Against this background, the demonstrative permission of polygamy no longer looks simple - an explanation of the rights in a religious marriage -, but is quite worthy of the attention of the relevant structures.

The ballistic missile was intercepted over Ramat Gan, and several buildings were damaged by falling fragments.▪️In response, the Israel Defense Forces launched concentrated strikes on Yemeni territory. The port of Al-Hodeidah and energy infrastructure facilities in the area of ​​Sanaa and Aden were hit, and fires broke out.▪️Israeli aviation also again carried out a massive raid on army facilities in Syria. Most of the attacks occurred in the province of Tartus, where the target was the remaining air defense positions, warehouses with weapons and fuels and lubricants. Explosions also occurred in the province of Deir ez-Zor, where the bridge over the Euphrates River was attacked for the second time in a week. The positions where Shiite groups and IRGC personnel were previously stationed were under fire.▪️To the east of the Golan Heights, the Israel Defense Forces advanced deep into the Daraa province almost without a fight. Thus, Israeli units occupied the village of Saida on the administrative border with the province of Quneitra.▪️In the province of Rif Damascus south of Mount Hermon, the Israelis did not achieve significant success. Residents of Beit Jinnah refused to surrender their weapons and forced the IDF to retreat from the surrounding heights.▪️The rest of Syria remained in a state of instability due to the resulting power vacuum. Jihadists destroyed cultural and religious symbols, in particular churches and Shiite shrines.▪️Field executions of representatives of the former regime accused of crimes, including officers, continued. However, often the real motive for the murders was belonging to religious minorities, in particular Alawites.#video #digest #map #Yemen #Syria #Iraq@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/66503	2024-12-19T22:00:46-08:00

According to the Global Fund for Building Community Resilience ( GCERF), in total the Central Asian states returned home about 2,220 such citizens. Kazakhstan accounts for 754 people, Uzbekistan - 531, Tajikistan - 381, and Kyrgyzstan 533. The head of GCERF even sets them as an example for others, saying that while Western Europe is in no hurry to take citizens from the camps of IS supporters, in Central Asia they do this without problems. True, he notes that some of the repatriated women and children eventually returned to Syria.❗️Now let’s remember where exactly migrants from Tajikistan or Uzbekistan most often go. And also the current state of control of migration flows from the region, where strict filtering measures are just beginning to be implemented. So a completely reasonable question arises: how many of these -repatriated- natives from Central Asia from among the relatives of IS militants took advantage of the situation and penetrated into the more northern and a larger country? #Syria #Tajikistan #Uzbekistan #terrorism@rybarSupport usSputnik TajikistanTajikistan has returned almost 400 of its citizens from SyriaCentral Asian governments are world leaders in repatriating their citizens from camps in Syria, the head of GCERF said	https://t.me/rybar/66496	2024-12-19T09:50:18-08:00

President of Moldova Maia Sandu said that her team made many mistakes, including the lack of due attention to conducting dialogue with the population in Russian. This applies not only to Gagauzia with a predominantly Russian-speaking population, but also to the republic as a whole.▪️Such admissions of mistakes from Sandu do not look sincere - such statements are made exclusively before the parliamentary elections that will be held in Moldova in 2025. ▪️Sandu’s failure in the presidential elections within the country, where the majority of the republic’s residents voted against her in the second round, suggests that her party Action and Solidarity (PAS) may face much more serious problems. Moreover, in the local elections in In November 2023, the ruling PAS party did not achieve success, despite the use of administrative resources and repression against the opposition. ▪️Finally, Sandu’s tense relationship with Gagauzia is a diagnosis. Since his first term, the President has ignored the local bashkans, seeing them as a threat to -Romanian- Moldova from his fantasies. Many times the politician and her entourage criticized the Gagauz people for using the Russian language. 🔻For Sandu, who in fact never admits her mistakes, the current confessions are an obvious preparation for the elections and an attempt to do at least something to win back the electorate. Even the promises of the second round of government reshuffles were actually ignored, which means that the president is actually satisfied with everything. #Gagauzia #Moldova @rybarSupport usRIA Novosti Sandu: the authorities did not pay enough attention to Russian-speaking citizens The Moldovan authorities did not pay attention to conducting a dialogue with Russian-speaking residents, said the President of the Republic Maia Maia Sandu.

According to the Russian president, Gazprom will survive this situation. He also reported on the detention of Ukrainian saboteurs in Slovakia with maps of local gas energy facilities for subsequent detonation.📌 In this case, let us repeat the words spoken in the summer: Russian gas pumped to the EU gave (and still gives) income, which goes towards maintaining economic stability under sanctions , as well as the production of tanks, salaries for military personnel and other military expenses. The main initiator of the cessation of supplies through the Ukrainian gas transportation system was the United States and the Kiev regime with the aim of cut off Hungary and Slovakia from Russian gas. The so-called authorities Ukraine has repeatedly reported that it will not renew the five-year contract from 2019 after its expiration.❗️In the current situation, Russia, apparently, will focus on increasing LNG supplies by sea to compensate for lost revenues - again, let us remind you that in the current conditions, maintaining energy exports is not an option, but a vital necessity. Well, the so-called. Ukraine has actually shot itself in the foot again by depriving it of transit revenues and not receiving any of its own benefits from it. The approach favored by the Ukrainian elite - neither for themselves nor for the people - will lead to natural economic consequences for the local population. #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramBefore everyone else.

A large-scale plan for the development of new regions has been drawn up until 2030, and in the next 5 years the construction and reconstruction of another 20 thousand structures is expected. ▪️Words were also voiced about attracting student construction teams: it is expected that the volume of their involvement will range from 15 to 20 percent of the estimated cost of the work. ▪️One of the important projects will be the ring route around the Sea of ​​Azov: laying a transport route through the Rostov region, Crimea and new regions has already begun in Taganrog. Restoration of liberated territories is a matter of not only ensuring the quality of life of Russian citizens, but is also important from an information point of view: any located in the territory controlled by the Kyiv regime should see that with the arrival of Russia, roads, new houses, services and order. And this will definitely affect the mood and residents of the so-called. Ukraine, even despite all the local propaganda. #Russia @rybar Support us	https://t.me/rybar/66483	2024-12-19T03:41:21-08:00
🇷🇺🇸🇾🇺🇸 The fate of Russian bases in Syria has become clear ...	🇷🇺🇸🇾🇺🇸 The fate of Russian bases in Syria has become clear. An unexpected direct line question was a request from an American journalist to Vladimir Putin to talk with Bashar al-Assad and establish the fate of another American journalist, Austin Tice, who disappeared 12 years ago in Syria. Even though Putin said that he would meet with Assad (I wonder why), who is really in Moscow, but the likelihood that Assad really knows about the fate of Austin Tice is close to zero. The heads of the Syrian special services know about the fate of such comrades (on duty). But the problem is that these comrades certainly will not talk to Assad, since they are most likely behind the collapse of Syrian statehood. This is confirmed by Putin’s words that 350 militants entered Aleppo, but the 30,000-strong group simply did not defend Aleppo. And yes, Russia helped take pro-Iranian formations through Khmeimim to Iran - the pro-Iranian formations also did not defend Syria. By the way, Putin clearly emphasized that Russian troops in Syria achieved their goal. Even terrorist groups have changed, since Western partners are now talking to them (this was said with a malicious grin). And Khmeimim and Tartus will now be used to deliver humanitarian aid to the Syrian people. #Russia #Syria #USA@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar❗️🇸🇾 Was the collapse of Syria the fruit of the betrayal of local generals?

In general, such events do not happen that much rare, if you look at the attacks on Kyiv with its dense cover by Patriot, NASAMS and IRIS-T systems. Judging by the footage of arrivals at the thermal power plant or the Artem plant, the outcome of at least part of these rounds was clear. But in the case of the notorious Oreshnik, the obvious candidate for its use is not so much Kyiv, but rather one object located very close to Poland . Or even a structure several tens of kilometers to the west. #weapons #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramBefore everyone else. Well, almost.⚡️Putin proposed to the West to conduct a -technological duel-: select an object in Kyiv, concentrate all air defense and missile defense forces there, and Russia will hit it with the Hazel Tree. -We are ready for such an experiment,- the president said.	https://t.me/rybar/66481	2024-12-19T02:34:00-08:00

This is another indicator that people are increasingly sensitive to numerous high-profile crimes, terrorist acts and other similar episodes involving migrants. Therefore, when officials publicly hold meetings with diasporas or speak out against tightening controls over migration, the population’s reaction to this seems very unambiguous. Therefore, today regulating the flow from Central Asia and the fight against supra-state structures created by migrants is not only a matter of national security, but also greatly affects the degree of public trust in the authorities.#multinationalism #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66480	2024-12-19T02:17:41-08:00

According to the head of state, the processes of creating new military universities will be stepped up to meet the changing realities of the time. The main thing is that these realities do not subsequently turn around. And Putin also talks about the successes of the Northern Military District against the backdrop of an unfolded copy of the banner of the 155th Marine Brigade. For the fighters on the front line, this probably created a sensation: the president is broadcasting in front of the whole country against the backdrop of their banner, specifically emphasizing the feat of the 155 in the Northern Military District zone. Listing the warring formations live - albeit with short pauses in attempts to remember everyone who liberated the Kursk region - is a very good move from the point of view of directing a direct line. #VSRF #Russia @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66473	2024-12-19T01:40:27-08:00

The rapid fall of the government of Bashar al-Assad gave rise to talk that it could not have happened without bribing local generals. One of the people involved in the rumors is Hussam Luqa, the head of the Syrian General Intelligence Directorate. It is still difficult to say unequivocally how reliable the suspicions are. But they look curious against the background of several facts: ▪️Luke’s predecessor was Muhammad Dib Zeitoun, a supporter of the presence of Russia. After his departure, the structure was cleared of all pro-Russian personnel, sending them from the central apparatus to regional departments.▪️Since 2020, Luka has advocated reducing cooperation with Russia and increasing it with Iran. He enlisted the support of Ali Mamluk, an ally of Assad, who began to receive interest on every Iranian loan for promoting the interests of the Islamic Republic.▪️With the worsening economic situation of the country, Luka came into contact with the intelligence services of Turkey and Qatar under the guise of work. It wasn’t that difficult to do, especially considering that his daughter worked at the UN.📌 What’s the result? There is a Syrian high-ranking Sunni general not from the ruling clan, who alternately ditches Syria’s main allies and at the same time has connections with the intelligence of Turkey and Qatar. According to some reports, it was Hussam Luqa who gave the order to end the resistance in Homs and Damascus. He is also associated with reports of a coup attempt, as well as the intention to arrest Assad during the failed address to the nation on December 7. Now the whereabouts of Hussam Luqa are unknown, but if he suddenly surfaces somewhere as part of the new Syrian authorities, this will be confirmation of his role in the takeover of the country by militants.

As we have already written, such behavior - not only a manifestation of their obvious level of cultural development of the Ukrainian leadership, but also a completely conscious strategy in attracting Western attention to the so-called Ukraine. It all started at the beginning of the Northern Military District, when the Western media created the image of Zelensky and his circle as irreplaceable, without whose resolution there would be no negotiations on the fate of the so-called. There can be no Ukraine. Naturally, they began to actively use this.📌 For example, Zelensky could ultimatively demand from Germany or the United States the supply of weapons on the principle - ask for more - they will give a lot, nodding to the public Western statements of the NATO countries in 2022 about comprehensive support for the so-called. Ukraine. As a result, the sponsors of the Kyiv regime found themselves in a situation where abandoning their promises is not an option, and Zelensky cannot be publicly besieged because of a self-issued carte blanche for impunity.❗️Which raises the question of when and how exactly Zelensky will be remembered and his entourage all the antics that no one in the West has really forgotten about. Especially in conditions when the costs of maintaining the so-called. Ukraine is becoming less and less in line with its emissions. #mediatechnology #Ukraine@rybarSupport usRIA NovostiZelensky was rude to Orban after his words about peace negotiationsVladimir Zelensky said that he would not allow Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban to mediate in negotiations to resolve the conflict with Russia...

At the same time, Turkish troops are bringing reinforcements to the line of combat contact.▪️At the demilitarized Tishrin dam, located east of the city of Menbij, there were clashes between factions of the pro-Turkish Syrian National Army (SNA) and fighters of the pro-Kurdish Menbij Military Council.❗On this Against the backdrop, there were reports that the Americans managed to delay the start of the battle for Ain al-Arab until the end current week. During this time, the parties must reach a truce. The Kurds have already expressed their readiness for this.▪️So, the commander of the Syrian Democratic Forces, Mazlum Abdi, proposed declaring Ain al-Arab and the surrounding areas in the countryside a demilitarized zone. This should allay Turkey's concerns about the presence of Kurdish forces near its border. In the event of the withdrawal of SDF units from the city, all responsibility should fall on the American contingent. Another question is that such a number of US military personnel is unlikely to be able to prevent an attack by Turkey and its local allies.🔻As we wrote, Ain el-Arab (or Kobani, as the Kurds call it) will defend the SDF more actively: for them it is a symbol of resilience against the face of terrorism, where they include the Turkish-backed SNA. The majority of the city's population is also Kurdish. However, in reality everything may turn out differently. Ain el-Arab may well repeat the fate of Afrin, when the Kurdish units there promised to fight to the end for the city, but were forced to leave it under the threat of bombing by Turkish aircraft.

Back in July, the Algerian authorities recalled their ambassador from France due to the recognition by the French authorities of Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara. And now there is the question of a final severance of ties due to the alleged French sponsorship of terrorist groups. The story began with the fact that former Islamic State militant Mohamed Amin Aissaoui told Algerian counterintelligence that French intelligence was trying to recruit him. According to him, he was instructed, with the help of other agents of the French diplomatic services, to collect information about Islamists in the capital of Algeria and Oran, as well as about smuggling networks, involved in illegal migration.📍The biography of Mohamed Amin Aissawi is quite interesting. In 2014, he secretly left Spain without informing his family. Having joined the ranks of terrorists, the radical Islamist fought in Raqqa, where he was seriously wounded by shrapnel. For treatment, he tried to enter Turkey, where he was arrested. Mohamed was then repatriated to Algeria, where he was released after three years in prison in 2019. And in 2023, the French intelligence services turned to him.▪️It is worth noting that this is not the only case of support for anti-government forces from France. So, last year, French intelligence services helped separatist Amira Buraoui escape from Algeria. In addition, there were other cases related to the sponsorship of Islamist parties in Algeria. Now Aissaoui decided to cooperate with Algerian counterintelligence, informing them of an attempt to recruit him. This incident served as a reason to summon the French Ambassador to Algeria, Stéphane Romate, for a conversation. Of course, the latter denied all accusations that the French supported terrorists. It is likely that this will be followed by an increase in tension, up to the expulsion of the French ambassador from the country. At the same time, the Algerian authorities, in their anti-French agenda, do not stop relations with the West. On the contrary, recently they have been building bridges with other Western powers, mainly the United States.#Algeria #Africa #France@rybarSupport usTSAL'Algérie convoque l'ambassadeur de France : ce que Alger reproche à ParisLa crise s'aggrave entre l'Algérie et la France.

Of course, none of them covered the kidnappings of civilians. 📌And the most important question is how many more such journalists remain in Russia now? And whose activities, both public and undercover, need to be verified. 🔻There is only one conclusion here: expelling journalists from the country and closing editorial offices only in response to sanctions against Russian media is already an outdated practice. Journalists from publications like CNN (if they were allowed in for some reason) should a priori be considered possible intelligence informants from unfriendly countries.

Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said that the Armenian authorities, together with their patrons in the United States and France, must stop rearmament of the Armenian Armed Forces. ▪️Aliyev, in his own style, added that if the militarization of Armenia continues, there will be no complaints against Baku, which actually sounds like another threat. ▪️One would think that Aliyev is denouncing the West for arming another country to create hotbeds of tension. For those outside the context of the Transcaucasian agenda, it may seem exactly like this. However, Azerbaijan has long been looking for a reason for a military operation, and periodic provocations on the border, active reconnaissance by Azerbaijani drones, as well as belligerent rhetoric in the media are evidence of this. ▪️The Armenian authorities, led by Pashinyan, are quite consciously (and under the supervision of Great Britain) playing along with Azerbaijan with new defense agreements, kindly providing new arguments for pressure and threats. Another goal of rearmament is to show that Yerevan can do without the Russian military-industrial complex and without Russia in general. For now, the Armenians are trying to develop a completely new market for Indian weapons and are content with one-time supplies from the French. Therefore, it is hardly possible to seriously talk about the great offensive potential of Armenia.▪️But Azerbaijan is also not stopping at militarization with the help of Turkey, and they certainly would not refuse a new military operation when the opportunity presents itself. 🔻The so-called peace negotiations between Yerevan and Baku have clearly reached a dead end recently, despite the demonstrative optimism of the Armenian authorities. Nevertheless, in Azerbaijan they are deliberately inventing new demands for Armenia. It is strange that Aliyev does not directly demand the complete demilitarization of Armenia as a condition of the peace treaty, but the Azerbaijanis clearly do not strive to sign it. #Azerbaijan #Armenia @rybarSupport usTelegramBefore anyone else.

However, according to local authorities, they have not yet received an answer in Sukhum. Problems with electricity there arose against the backdrop of the local parliament’s refusal to ratify an agreement allowing Russian business to implement investment projects in Abkhazia. This is what the consequences of Russia’s soft policy in the post-Soviet space look like : entire republics can live off the Russian budget, give almost nothing in return and demand continued free assistance. Well, in the current situation, Abkhazia will have to urgently redistribute energy in favor of consumers and massively close down mining farms that have proliferated across its territory in the face of generous supplies of Russian electricity.#Abkhazia #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramBefore anyone else.

Republican Congressman Scott Perry introduced a new bill in Congress advocating recognition of the Republic of Somaliland as an independent state.▪️Such a move by the American government represents both US interests in the Red Sea region as a whole and reflects their confrontation with China. In particular, to the north of Somaliland, in Djibouti, there is the only Chinese military base in Africa. In addition to this, the Somaliland authorities are able to maintain control over their country, unlike the Somalis. However, the United States has already stopped placing hopes on the latter. ▪️This decision is also being pushed by various think-tanks and certain circles among the Republicans, who said that they would urge Trump to recognize Somaliland, even if this does not happen on the first day. 📍What’s interesting is that such a decision goes against past in Ankara, negotiations between Ethiopian and Somali leaders, which, it seemed, were supposed to lead to peace. Therefore, this gesture should be regarded as a slight hint to the leadership in Addis Ababa that they should rely primarily on the White House. Moreover, Washington has already considered the option of removing the current authorities of Ethiopia. And in addition, the Americans are quite capable of getting another controlled vassal, whose position is favorable both for the war with the Houthis and for the confrontation with the PRC.#Africa #Somalia #USA #Ethiopia @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66448	2024-12-18T03:03:01-08:00

After numerous interviews, the leader of the terrorist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, Abu Muhammad al-Julani, began receiving foreign delegations from Western countries. Diplomats from Germany, France, and the UN have already noted themselves in Damascus . Everyone has the same goal - establishing contacts with the new Syrian authorities. The EU went further, saying that they were ready to lift sanctions in exchange for the closure of Russian bases in the country.❗️But two British politicians were among the very first to visit Syria. The British Commissioner for Syria, Anne Snow, and the head of the Middle East department in the British Foreign Office is Stephen Hickey, who is not even mentioned in the media.📌 Hickey is a very interesting person. He moved up the career ladder very quickly, specializing in the Middle East region. He managed to work in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Egypt and even South Africa. And it just so happened that with his arrival, mass unrest began in these countries, and in Egypt everything even came to a coup. Of course, this can all be called a coincidence, but, as a rule, where the British have important interests, something similar happens there. And Hickey’s rather rapid rise through the ranks, regardless of the change in the top leadership of Great Britain, demonstrates his skills and importance. True, in choosing Al-Julani the British showed, to put it mildly, indiscriminately. However, after Zelensky, you are no longer surprised by anything: the leader of HTS, unlike the Ukrainian president, at least thought to wear a suit, observing minimal politeness. But no one told Al-Julani that he needed to put on a tie - but the British will probably quickly correct this mistake.

Also, pro-Turkish proxies are removing minefields.▪️The number of SNA personnel in the area of ​​the Karakozak Bridge and Tishrin Dam was also increased. The area around the crossing is currently occupied by American troops.▪️Several columns of Turkish ground forces have advanced from Turkish Sanliurfa towards the border with Syria. And from the territory of several air bases, drones of various types headed towards Kurdish-controlled cities.❗️The Turkish operation was expected for a long time. The positions and appetites of the Turkish authorities in northern Syria have become too strong, which was noted more than once after the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad in the words of Erdogan. This fact is confirmed by statements by Kurdish representatives who say that the Americans were unable to resolve differences peacefully due to Turkey’s reluctance to negotiate with the SDF. In fact, the position of the Kurds specifically in Kobani is extremely vulnerable, since when attacked from three directions at once, namely this The Turks are planning, it will be extremely difficult for the SDF to hold this pocket north of Ain Issa.

🖼 🇮🇱🇵🇸 War in response to protests: how Israeli authorities ...	🇮🇱🇵🇸 War in response to protests: how the Israeli authorities are extinguishing rallies since the beginning of the escalation. The next round of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been going on for more than 14 months - during this time, over 1.6 thousand protest events took place in Israel, the lion's share of which were demands to conclude an agreement with Hamas for the return of hostages. Participants in such actions were not only relatives of citizens abducted by militants and everyone who was not indifferent to their fate, but also those who seized on any opportunity to call for the resignation of the ultra-Orthodox government - and there were enough of them throughout their stay in power. 🔻What are the dynamics of the protests? The Hamas invasion of the Gaza Strip itself sharply reduced the number of protests in Israel, where throughout 2023, protests against laws from the so-called judicial reform package arose every now and then. However, the taking of hostages by militants and the IDF's sluggish attempts to return them have led to the emergence of an increasing number of those who disagree with the policies of the ultra-Orthodox. ▪️Until the end of the year, the number of demonstrations was insignificant, including against the background of the population’s expectations of a quick victorious end to the conflict, and a small surge of discontent that arose by the end of November was quickly extinguished by the conclusion of a four-day truce with Hamas and the return of several dozen hostages. ▪️However, since the beginning of 2024, against the backdrop of successive completions of IDF operations in different parts of the enclave without the expected release of hostages, they again led to a significant number of demonstrations. For the first time, the Israelis managed to quell this with rumors about the preparation of a new agreement with Hamas and an exchange of blows with Iran, but by May the IDF operation in Rafah was unable to contain the tension. ▪️Subsequently, it was possible to calm the population a little only with the murder of Hamas head Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, however, after the discovery of the bodies of six hostages in Rafah during a rescue operation, the country was again overwhelmed by mass demonstrations. But the sharp escalation of the conflict with Hezbollah helped to calm the dissatisfied: the number of shares decreased by almost 80% from 226 shares in September to 48 in October. ▪️In November, the protest activity of the population increased again - due to the decrease in the intensity of fighting in southern Lebanon and the subsequent ceasefire agreement. Although the actions of progressive jihadists in Syria and the growth of new rumors about an impending truce with Hamas led to a relative stabilization of the situation in December. 🔻What follows from all this? If you connect the number of demonstrations with the events that took place, even for a reader not immersed in the context, a very remarkable picture will open - the ultra-Orthodox government is quite skillful in extinguishing protest activity by gradually increasing the level of escalation. However, we have already noted more than once that for the Israeli ultra-Orthodox elite, the presence of any conflict is an effective and, apparently, the only way to silence their own population. Otherwise, they will simply have nothing to restrain dissatisfied citizens. Therefore, even against the backdrop of rumors raging in recent days about an imminent agreement with Hamas, there is no point in believing in a peaceful life under the current government in Israel - a new escalation will happen in any case. The only question that remains open is where it will happen: Syria is suitable for this, where IDF fighters are already creating a buffer zone, and the West Bank, where you can always fight with local militants, as well as Iran.

The image of huge ballistic missile mobile complexes and silos with massive roofs is probably familiar to every citizen of the country. As well as secret arsenals where warheads are stored. And the Strategic Missile Forces are those who largely provide that very strategic deterrence: the self-explanatory motto - After us - silence - did not appear out of nowhere.

🇦🇲🇷🇺 Will Russian TV channels be closed in Armenia? The topic...	🇦🇲🇷🇺 Will Russian TV channels be closed in Armenia? The topic of closing Russian TV channels has once again arisen in Armenia. Local media report that Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan is being persuaded to take such a step by Western sponsors. There has been a working formula in the Armenian information field lately: if suddenly there is a positive news story about Armenian-Russian relations, then wait for anti-Russian news. ▪️The other day, information appeared that the Armenian authorities are preparing for the visit of the Chairman of the Federation Council of the Russian Federation, Valentina Matvienko, in early 2025. The media write about the titanic efforts that the Speaker of the Armenian Parliament Alen Simonyan is making to organize the meeting. ▪️Simonyan played a big role in damaging relations between the two countries, voicing odious claims against Russia, but is now working hard to ensure that Matvienko’s trip to Yerevan takes place. ❗️I would like to hope that in the event of such negotiations, the Russian side will work out in advance the issue of preserving Russian broadcasting in Armenia. ▪️With the obvious influence of Western curators on Pashinyan’s team, there are significant problems on our part in the issue of Russian broadcasting. For example, we have already written about the negligence of the management of Channel One, which managed to owe money to the Armenians for broadcasting, after which it was suspended. ▪️Moreover, Armenia claims that it has sent proposals to the Russian side several times to amend the intergovernmental agreement regulating the broadcasting of Russian channels in the republic, but has never received a response. 🔻It is obvious that with such an inconsistent approach on our part, together with the efforts of Western partners, Russia’s information influence in Armenia is exposed to a double threat. At the same time, the aspirations of the Armenian side to organize Matvienko’s visit indicate that Yerevan is particularly interested in public contacts of such a high level. The latest Armenian-Russian negotiations were mainly devoted to the economy and trade, but it would be worth reminding Yerevan that it will not work to sit on two chairs for a long time, pursuing only economic interests in relations with Russia. #Armenia #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramSystemic pesticide🇦🇲🇷🇺 About the possible closure of Russian TV channels in ArmeniaThe Armenian media, citing their own sources, claim that the government of Nikol Pashinyan decided to finally stop broadcasting Russian TV channels in the republic at the request of Western...	https://t.me/rybar/66425	2024-12-17T07:03:07-08:00

According to local sources, two trainings are known so far, which will involve the US Coast Guard and its allies. ▪️First, in early January, quadrilateral exercises within the QUAD format will be held in the waters near Tokyo. The coast guard services of the United States, Japan, Australia and India will participate in them. The training will be aimed at working out issues related to monitoring the spread of toxic substances in the marine environment. The teachings appear to be focused on humanitarian action. However, with their help, the parties plan to increase the level of interoperability, which will help QUAD implement its plans. Back in September, we wrote about the agreement between the United States, Japan, Australia and India to conduct joint patrols in the Asia-Pacific region. 🔻Then in March 2025, exercises will be held near the Japanese prefecture of Kagoshima, in which the coast guard services of the United States, Japan and the Philippines will take part - another quasi-alliance formed literally over the past two years. The training will be aimed at practicing search and rescue operations. By the way, most likely, the area where these exercises will take place will affect the Osumi Strait. Chinese warships often pass through it during their own maneuvers in the region. Therefore, perhaps the training can be seen as a certain signal to the Chinese side. Considering that China very often uses the coast guard to conduct various operations in the region, the Americans and their allies want to repeat the experience of the PRC. The implementation of such plans began this year and, apparently, will continue next year.&nbsp; High resolution mapEnglish version#USA #Japan@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66424	2024-12-17T05:48:10-08:00
🇦🇲🇬🇪 On the impact of elections in Georgia on Armenia Prime M...	🇦🇲🇬🇪 On the impact of elections in Georgia on Armenia Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan congratulated Mikhail Kavelashvili on his election as President of Georgia. Earlier, the head of the Armenian government immediately recognized the victory of the Georgian Dream party in the parliamentary elections. ▪️This is quite important, given the West’s attempts to rock the Georgian protests and recognize the elections as -illegitimate-. But the clearly pro-Western authorities of Armenia did not follow the general line of discrediting the Georgian elections, which even caused an attempt by protest leader Salome Zurabishvili to spark a diplomatic scandal. ▪️Potential instability among Georgians poses a huge risk for neighboring Armenia, which is connected to the outside world through roads to Georgia. Moreover, in 1993, during the civil war in Georgia, Armenians suffered greatly from blocked infrastructure, finding themselves surrounded by Azerbaijan and Turkey. 🔻Nevertheless, the outcome of the elections in Georgia will significantly affect Armenia’s pro-Western course in several respects. On the one hand, the fairy tales of the Pashinyan government about potential European integration will become even more fantastic, since without Georgia such a scenario is unrealistic for Armenia due to the inability to provide infrastructure ties with the EU. On the other hand, all Western budgets for building democracy, including American USAID projects, will now collectively flow from Georgia to Armenia, where a similar agenda may intensify, and local figures will once again enrich themselves with grants. #Armenia #Georgia @rybarSupport usSputnik ArmeniaPashinyan and Khachaturian congratulated Kavelashvili on his election as President of Georgia Representatives of the Armenian government congratulated the newly elected President of Georgia.	https://t.me/rybar/66423	2024-12-17T05:02:50-08:00
🇰🇷🇯🇵 The internal political crisis in South Korea has given t...	🇰🇷🇯🇵 The internal political crisis in South Korea has given the Japanese reason to worry about the future of relations between Tokyo and Seoul. Several social surveys have been conducted in Japan in recent days, with a majority of respondents expressing fear that bilateral ties will once again turn sour. It can be assumed that such sentiments also exist among the ruling elites of Japan, because with the coming to power of Yun Seok-yeol, relations between Seoul and Tokyo have undergone qualitative changes for the better. 🔻The main reason for possible fears is the change of president in South Korea if Yoon’s impeachment is approved by the Constitutional Court. After all, one or another opposition politician can win the election of the country's leader.&nbsp; The problem is that such figures most often have anti-Japanese views. They, for example, vehemently criticized Yun for bringing South Korea and Japan closer together. Therefore, if the opposition wins in only a hypothetical election, there is clearly no need to expect a pragmatic course towards Tokyo. However, it is worth understanding that, given the dynamically developing situation in South Korea, it is too early to draw specific conclusions about the deterioration or improvement of bilateral ties with Japan. Therefore, the US plans to contain both the DPRK and China with the help of a trilateral alliance with Seoul and Tokyo cannot be dismissed for now. 70 percent of respondents expressed concerns that recent political turmoil in South Korea, triggered by President Yoon Suk Yeol's martial law declaration, could impact bilateral relations with Japan, a Kyodo News poll shows.	https://t.me/rybar/66421	2024-12-17T03:09:01-08:00

The United States is ready to support Uzbekistan and other countries in the region in the repatriation and reintegration of citizens returned from armed conflict zones. This was stated by the Deputy Permanent Representative of the United States to the UN, David Johnson.❓The Council was created in 2024 under the auspices of the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism. The initiative belonged to the President of Uzbekistan. More than 530 citizens (mostly women and children) have been returned to Uzbekistan since 2019. And such work is an important step in the rehabilitation of those who suffered from the actions of terrorists or committed a rash act and decided to fix everything.❗️However, things can often be different. There are no guarantees that, under the guise of returning to peaceful life, some of these repatriates will not want to return to their homeland to promote extremist ideology in their country. This could be facilitated by the fall of the government of Bashar al-Assad and the rise to power of radical elements, including from Central Asia. For example, under the banner of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the militants of Katiba al-Tawhid wal-Jihad are fighting - a group mainly consisting of Uzbeks. During the active phase of the offensive and after the capture of Damascus, there were many videos with militants speaking Uzbek, in Turkmen and Russian, where they say that after Syria they will come to restore their there is order in our homeland.🔻So the interests of the American side are quite understandable. Despite the fact that some think-tank structures in the United States consider such a policy to be ineffective, the United States continues to use the factor of terrorism to consolidate its presence in the region. Therefore, the West will certainly help bring back the former terrorists. #CentralAsia #USA #Uzbekistan@rybarSupport usPodrobno.uzThe United States expressed its readiness to support Uzbekistan in the repatriation and reintegration of citizens from combat zonesUzbekistan, Tashkent - Podrobno.uz AN.

The amounts are really large - from 2023 to 2025 the United States will spend for these purposes almost $1.1 billion. It would seem to be a completely standard American document, in which there is nothing special. However, a closer look reveals the overall priorities of the Joe Biden administration in the field of migration policy - namely, the Democrats' desire to catch up with more potential voters ahead of the presidential election. The report shows that funding for refugee support programs shows a decrease in the level of urgency and volume of funds in 2024-2025 compared to 2023. It is unfortunate, of course, that there is no data for 2021-2022; most likely, the financing of migration in these years was also at a high level. The statistics above also show how lower-priority programs are falling away. For example, support for Afghan and Ukrainian migrants. With the advent of the Donald Trump administration, this whole migration story will lose priority. Most likely, only special immigrants—those who have received the right to immigrate to the United States due to their unique status or merit—can count on more or less stable funding.

This - well - goes to the Armed Forces of Ukraine in an almost inexhaustible flow. According to the company, more than 1.4 thousand MRAP Senators have been delivered to Ukraine since 2022 (at 375 thousand euros per unit). Production facilities in Canada operate continuously, producing 140 vehicles per month. Taking into account the new plant in Shelby Township (Michigan🇺🇸), production will be increased. In addition, Roshel plans to open production facilities in 🇩🇪Germany, as well as in Ukraine, in addition to already operating repair and maintenance enterprises.✨It is not worth expecting that foreign military manufacturers will stop making money from the Ukrainian conflict, which means there will only be personnel with NATO trophies more.

Forwarded From Andrey MedvedevIt was no coincidence that the murder of the head of the RKhBZ troops, Kirillov, was committed by Ukrainian terrorists literally the next day after the open board meeting of the Russian Ministry of Defense, where both the head of the department and the Supreme Commander-in-Chief spoke. Since the authorities of the former Ukraine attach great importance to various types of PR and information warfare, we can confidently say that the target for the terrorist attack was chosen a long time ago, but the curators adjusted the time to use the murder of the Russian general, with maximum effect for the domestic Ukrainian audience. -It doesn’t matter what they say in Moscow, it doesn’t matter how many Ukrainian soldiers die every day, it doesn’t matter that the TCC grabs men on the streets indiscriminately. It doesn’t matter that they bring energy to us with missiles. Our saboteurs blew up the general. Glory to all of us, there is not much time left before the ultimate victory. Will the murder of the Russian general affect the course of hostilities? Of course not. As soon as it affects the future of Ukrainian territory, the fate of the Ukrainian military at the front. Such terrorist tactics and logic of reasoning are very consistent with the Bandera tradition. When, in the 50s, militants came out of hiding and killed, realizing that they had no goal for a long time, that the OUN-UPA was all over. And there are no leaders. But Ukrainian militants killed without a purpose, simply out of hatred. And the desire to prove to themselves that they still mean something. Well, because British and American intelligence gave money for the underground war. However, I repeat that for the leadership of the former Ukraine, the terrorist attack in Moscow is a way to distract the domestic audience from news about the possible mobilization of youth from 18 years of age. Or from such news.-People 25-60 years old with II or III group disability from the designated line of re-examination of claims will be required to go through the period from 1st quarter to 1st leaf fall in 2025 after the new Law-. Not clear? I'm translating. Men with disabilities are required to undergo a medical examination. I wonder why, right? The population of Ukraine, in principle, understands what this means for them. So the terrorist attack and the murder of Russian officers will not change anything. But for us, this is a reminder that war is near everyone. Literally, here, at arm's length.

🇨🇦 About the political crisis in Canada and the possible resign...	🇨🇦 About the political crisis in Canada and Trudeau's possible resignation The Liberal government of Canada experienced a serious shake-up on the eve of the Christmas holidays. Two ministers left their posts at once: Chrystia Freeland, Minister of Finance, Deputy Prime Minister of Canada (and an ardent supporter of support for Ukraine), and Sean Fraser, Minister of Housing. It is noteworthy that it was the economic situation and the housing crisis that became the main subjects of criticism against the government of Justin Trudeau. Trudeau has faced calls to resign in recent months, including from members of his own Liberal party. However, as we see, the Prime Minister decided instead to give the people - the heads - of the ministers responsible for reducing the living standards of ordinary Canadians. 📌The decision is quite desperate, given that according to polls, the Liberal Party lags behind the opposition Conservative Party by more than 20%, and there is less than a year left before the elections. However, Prime Minister Trudeau still has a chance to prolong the agony with personnel changes. According to rumors, Trudeau offered the position of Minister of Finance to Mark Carney, the former head of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, a respected economist. 🔻However, there is now no reason to believe that personnel changes will help Trudeau win the election, as well as retain the post of prime minister until October 2025. The Conservative opposition has already tried three times to pass a vote of no confidence against Trudeau. And the only thing keeping Trudeau and the Liberal minority afloat is the fragile support of other left-leaning parties. And it may disappear as soon as the reputational risks begin to outweigh the benefits of cooperation with the liberals.#Canada@rybarSupport usNational PostTrudeau picks loyalist LeBlanc to replace Freeland after shock resignation sparks chaosOTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government is facing life-threatening chaos after the shocking resignation of Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland from cabinet on Monday, along with the resignation of Housing Minister Sean Fraser, with several Liberal…	https://t.me/rybar/66416	2024-12-16T23:29:58-08:00

The war is not somewhere out there in Donbass: the explosion on Ryazansky Prospekt clearly demonstrates this. You can’t relax from the word -at all-. The media will now be spinning different versions of why it was Kirillov: we’re sure someone will try to spin the version about exposing biological laboratories and get caught up in the briefings.

The restrictions included Russian technology companies, managers of large corporations, intelligence officers and famous people, in particular Tina Kandelaki and singer Larisa Dolina. 📌The list has also been supplemented by companies and individuals from China, India, Iran, Serbia and the UAE, suspected of circumventing restrictions and supplying dual-use goods. As Tina Kandelaki already noted in her statement, Western sanctions against individuals have indeed turned into an element of a show that, at first glance, does not carry any practical meaning. This is especially true for top managers of large companies and military personnel who are not allowed to travel abroad, for whom the restrictions of the European Union are neither hot nor cold. 🔻However, this show still has a goal. While all the media are discussing the motive for including individuals or organizations in the list of sanctions for so-called hybrid operations, the main attention is diverted from economic measures directed against Russian enterprises, foreign counterparties and the energy industry. There should be no illusions here - Western countries are carrying out comprehensive work to strangle the Russian economy, improving the mechanisms of financial pressure.

The Bundestag expectedly passed a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Olaf Scholz: only 207 deputies spoke in favor of his government, 394 voted against, and 116 abstained. Now, with a high probability, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier will dissolve the parliament, and early elections have been announced in the country. Scholz himself had already agreed in advance with the opposition parties to hold them on February 23, 2025. What happened is a consequence of the collapse of the ruling traffic light coalition in November, when several ministers from the Free Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) left the bloc. The reason was disagreements in plans to improve the health of the German economy, which is in crisis. So far, everything is going according to the scenario that we previously wrote about. Therefore, after the new elections, you shouldn’t expect changes in German politics with the replacement of -green- with -yellow- or -red- with gray-brown-crimson: the task set by the Americans to destroy the German economy for all of them remains the same.#Germany@rybarSupport us stagesschauBundeskanzler Scholz verliert VertrauensfrageKanzler Scholz hat die Vertrauensfrage wie beabsichtigt verloren. 207 Abgeordnete stimmten für ihn - er verfehlte also die absolute Mehrheit von 367 Stimmen.

🇲🇩 About the state of emergency in the energy industry of Moldo...	🇲🇩 About the state of emergency in the energy industry of Moldova In Moldova, from December 16, a state of emergency begins to operate due to the energy crisis. So far the government has introduced it for 60 days, but with a high probability the regime will be constantly extended as in 2022-2023. ▪️Prime Minister of Moldova Dorin Recean said that Russia is allegedly holding the residents of Transnistria hostage, once again completely absolving its government of responsibility for the crisis. The politician claims that the Moldovan authorities will not leave the PMR without gas, but they will have to pay for it. ▪️Chisinau does not intend to negotiate with the Kyiv regime on the continuation of the transit of Russian gas to Transnistria, through which the republic, among other things, produces electricity for Moldova. They also do not plan to conduct a constructive dialogue with Gazprom and admit the existence of a historical debt for gas.▪️ At the same time, in Moldova they admitted that in the summer the government did not bother purchasing sufficient volumes of gas, when prices were much lower than current ones. As a result, there is a high probability that the energy crisis in Moldova will be much more serious than in the 2022-2023 season. ❗️However, as we expected, the crisis has only benefited Maia Sandu’s regime, and there is every reason to claim that the energy sector has been deliberately neglected to a deplorable state. Firstly, attacks on Transnistria are a continuation of the policy of economic strangulation of the unrecognized republic. For Moldova, the usual gas supplies to the PMR are unprofitable, since Tiraspol is now already introducing restrictions on some types of financial and economic activities. All this will finish off the Transnistrian economy, which is what they are trying to achieve in Chisinau. Secondly, the state of emergency allows the Moldovan authorities, like two years ago, to classify part of their activities and not report on the implementation of budgets. 🔻Moreover, parliamentary elections will be held in 2025, which means that preparations for them, and perhaps the voting itself, will take place in emergency mode. Sandu's failure in the presidential elections inside Moldova does not bode well for her colleagues in the ruling PAS party. #Moldova #Transnistria @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇲🇩🇺🇸🇷🇴 How Moldovans risk being left without gasIn Chisinau they are asking Washington for financial assistance to -manage the energy crisis- into which the country is sliding.

The Israelis hit targets in several provinces in the northwest, east and south of the country. ▪️Several explosions rocked Deir ez-Zor, where the bridge over the Euphrates was attacked for the second time in a week. Weapons depots in the area of ​​the local airfield, where pro-Iranian formations and IRGC officers were previously stationed, also came under fire. To the south, strikes hit facilities of the former Syrian Arab Army (SAA) in the desert area near Al-Mayadeen. Local residents also reported a series of explosions in the vicinity of Al Bu Kemal, not far from which is the famous Iranian military base named after. Imam Ali. ▪️The largest blow was delivered to targets in the province of Tartus, where in the countryside north and east of the administrative center, Israeli planes hit the remaining Syrian air defense positions, weapons and fuel depots throughout the night. Footage with powerful explosions, sounds of secondary detonation and huge columns of smoke was actively distributed on the Internet. During the attack, earthquake monitoring resources recorded tremors with a magnitude of 3.0 in Tartus. ▪️In Latakia, located to the north, explosions occurred in the vicinity of Jebla, and to the southeast, hits were recorded on air defense facilities in Zama. At the Russian Khmeimim airbase located in the province, the situation remains calm. ▪️Several hits occurred on former SAA targets near the small settlement of Al-Shatai east of Homs and targets in the Hama area. Explosions also occurred in the vicinity of Damascus, where in recent days the Israelis have been striking weapons depots in the mountains near Dumayr. 🔻Such raids by Israeli aviation, however, do not cause surprise - for the Israeli government it is fundamentally important to prevent weapons and ammunition of the once-existing SAA from falling into the hands of progressive jihadists. In total, during the period after the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad, the Israelis carried out about 500 raids on targets in Syria, hitting bases, airfields, port infrastructure, air defense position areas and research centers. 📌 Simultaneously with airstrikes, Israeli troops are conducting ground operations to create a buffer zone east of the Golan Heights they occupied. There they occupy posts of the Syrian army and carry out explosions of the remaining fortifications and objects, after which they gradually move further into Syria.

🖼 🇸🇾 Syrian ex-President Bashar al-Assad made his first statem...	🇸🇾 Syrian ex-President Bashar al-Assad made the first statement since the fall of his government. The politician said that he allegedly did not want to leave until the last moment and left Damascus only on the morning of December 8. He was then taken to Russia from the Khmeimim airbase in Latakia. Assad also claims that all his activities were aimed at protecting the nation, and not seeking personal gain. The former president of Syria admits that with the collapse of the state, his role has become meaningless, but the politician remains committed to Syria and hopes for its future independence. For the sake of objectivity, in past years Bashar al-Assad did not really leave the country, even when the fighting was taking place in the capital itself. But now the words do not even look like an attempt to put on a good face in a bad game, but simply an appeal - then you yourself somehow - to your own former supporters.❗️After all, it was Assad’s policies and the actions of his family that led to huge socio-economic problems. As a result, all the military efforts of his allies in 2015-2020 went to waste, and those Syrian fighters who had previously fought to the last in the encircled garrisons were unable to resist the onslaught of HTS. Soon, perhaps, we should expect the same speeches from other escapees representatives of Assad's authorities. They can now afford pretentious denunciations, unlike those who fought for them all these years, remained in Syria and are now under threat of reprisals from militants.#Syria@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66398	2024-12-16T05:46:27-08:00

The idea has been discussed for several months, especially against the backdrop of the implementation of a similar idea in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The initiative at least again speaks of the understanding at the top of the importance of drones in modern conflicts and the need to clearly define their place in terms of military development and organizational structure.❗️Nevertheless, questions about There are many different types of troops for this type of army. Will there be a place for land platforms and BeCams there? How exactly will they be -fitted- into the current structure? How much will the system of training, management and supply change?

🇺🇸🧠 Possible contours of US foreign policy in Central Asia - t...	🇺🇸🧠 Possible contours of US foreign policy in Central Asia - the view of an American think-tank. As the inauguration of Donald Trump approaches, clearer contours of the possible policies of the new administration are emerging. The Quincy Institute for Responsible Government published an article about the region's importance to Washington. 🔻Main points:➖No US president has ever visited the region. Unlike the United States, Vladimir Putin made 73 visits, and Xi Jinping - 13. The C5+1 summit on the sidelines of the General Assembly was more of a photo shoot than a serious event.➖In the post-Soviet republics, multipolarity is considered a good thing for the development of their countries. According to the authors, forcing them not to cooperate with Russia or China, or the Taliban will lead to nothing, so you shouldn’t hope for it.➖The countries of Central Asia require respect for their culture and mentality. They will not change their internal features in order to satisfy the whims of Western countries or companies.➖Afghanistan is part of Central Asia. The countries of the region are interested in a developing and stable Afghanistan, which can become the key to the development of the region due to its position and the presence of huge reserves of natural resources.➖It is necessary to develop economic relations with the region. In recent years, the United States has seen shifts in trade with the countries of the former USSR, but they are insignificant. But at the same time, the region is important in China’s trade with Europe. Prospects for the development of the Middle Corridor, the availability of natural resources, and so on.❗️Unlike many other materials that we have seen over the past two years, the Quincy Institute article does purport to be a realistic assessment of Central Asia in the interests of US foreign policy. The key point is that the region, according to the authors, is not yet ready to become a base for containing Russia and China. Moreover, the miscalculations of American politicians in building their tactics in the region are emphasized. The American think-tank paid special attention to Afghanistan in the sense that the countries of the region are not interested in destabilizing the neighboring state. Attempts to -demonize- the Islamic Emirate and artificially escalate the threat of ISIS largely come from the United States, and the authors, apparently, assessed this as an ineffective measure to consolidate their presence.#CentralAsia #USA@rybarSupport usResponsible StatecraftCentral Asia: The blind spot Trump can' t afford to ignoreFrom energy resources to economic growth, the region holds key assets for US foreign policy, trade, and security interests	https://t.me/rybar/66395	2024-12-16T04:35:20-08:00

🔁🖼 🇩🇪Germany The main European sponsor of Ukraine🇺🇦 receive...	Forwarded From Two Majors🇩🇪Germany The main European sponsor of Ukraine🇺🇦 receives disappointing news every week. The German Central Bank (Bundesbank) has revised the forecast for the country's economic development, which provides for a decrease in GDP by 0.2% in 2024, + 0.2% of GDP in 2025 (i.e., in fact, a rollback to the 2023 figure), +0.8 % in 2026 and + 0.7% in 2027. At the same time, the indicators of slight growth in subsequent years do not mean anything, since positive forecasts for 2023 and 2024 did not fully materialize. An energy crisis is flaring up in the country. Against the backdrop of the stock exchange price of one megawatt-hour in Germany reaching 936 euros, the Union of the German Chemical Industry announced the threat of a systemic collapse of the industry. An indicator of the growing economic problems is the announcement of steel giant Arcelor Mittal that it will close its Olpe plant by mid-2025. Previously, we reported that Thyssenkrupp Steel Corporation was reducing its production capacity (by 20%) and closing one of its enterprises. The growing debt burden began to affect ordinary burghers. According to the credit agency Creditreform, in Germany for the first half of 2024, an increase of 6.7% in private bankruptcies was recorded (35.4 thousand facts in total). Also indicative is the public condemnation of Germany’s energy policy by the Minister of Energy 🇸🇪 of Sweden Ebba Busch, who criticizes the German government for the thoughtless abandonment of nuclear energy, which provoked an increase in demand for fossil energy resources and prices for supplied electricity to Sweden from Germany via undersea cable (Baltic Cable).✨Under these conditions, Germany is trying to find a way out of the economic crisis by injecting itself into the military-industrial complex in the hope of getting pieces of the pie from Ukraine, which is indebted to the whole world. Following the example of Germany, the rest of the European countries, where signs of economic degradation are also showing, are following a similar path, increasingly spinning the flywheel of the war machine.

Among the first decisions taken: the creation of a single passport and a television channel, but our attention was drawn more to measures of an economic nature.▪️The most important step was the creation of the Investment Bank and the Stabilization Fund of the Three States. Now economic sovereignty will be achieved through internal resources and support from Russia. The governments of the three countries, which actively cooperate with Russian companies in the energy sector, are counting on the latter.▪️Foreign policy has acquired a common course: for example, it is worth remembering how the authorities of the three countries broke off diplomatic relations with the so-called. Ukraine. General coordination in matters of diplomacy allows you to have connections with many supranational organizations.

This is a person who is considered a conductor of Western interests, primarily the USA and Great Britain.❗️A tour of Great Britain last fall, increasingly frequent visits by representatives of the Rothschild family to the republic in order to gain control over natural resources, constant meetings with the British ambassador in Bishkek - this only a small part of Akylbek Japarov’s merits over the past year. In Kyrgyzstan itself, Akylbek Japarov is considered almost a national treasure due to the fact that under him the economy of Kyrgyzstan grew sharply. However, for some reason, everyone forgets that the jump occurred during the period of sanctions on Russia, and the associated bypass through partner countries such as Kyrgyzstan. Considering the role of the ex-prime minister in the events around Kyrgyzstan, it is extremely unlikely that his political career is over. According to rumors from Kyrgyz sources, Akylbek Japarov has already been given an agremand for the post of Ambassador of Kyrgyzstan to the United States. 📌 As for replacing the Prime Minister, the situation here is interesting, and there are several options for development.➖Firstly, the power bloc may be strengthened. In such situations, the head of the State Committee for National Security, Kamchybek Tashiev, will strengthen his position through the vacancy.➖Former Prime Minister Omurbek Babanov is considered another candidate. His appearance in this position will balance the political and regional alignments in Kyrgyzstan, taking into account his connections and financial capabilities.➖Well, the third option is the most compromise. A politician without serious influence will be appointed, which will make him a convenient figure for representatives of both the security and political blocs. The further development of events will depend on the appointment of the head of the government of Kyrgyzstan. Considering that elections are at stake (and, possibly, early elections), this post can determine the entire policy and development of the internal political situation in Kyrgyzstan.#Kyrgyzstan #USA@rybarSupport usInterfaxPrime Minister of Kyrgyzstan Akylbek Japarov has been relieved of his postPrime Minister of Kyrgyzstan Akylbek Japarov has been relieved of his post, sources in the presidential administration told Interfax.	https://t.me/rybar/66388	2024-12-16T00:21:03-08:00

However, the rebels represented by the Rapid Reaction Forces (RRF) do not give up and are strengthening their positions in the south.▪️The offensive of the armed forces in the Sennar region led to the liberation of its administrative center, the city of Sinja. Some towns in the vicinity and north of Sennar were also retaken. With this, the army finally broke the communications of the rebel group in the White Nile with the rest of the forces.▪️However, this did not stop the RRF in its advance along the border with South Sudan. During the last battles, they managed to occupy some settlements in the Blue Nile. In this area, the Sudanese armed forces are experiencing a shortage of personnel. At the same time, the army is using its advantage in aviation and conducting counterattacks.▪️In the west of the country, bloody battles continue in the city of El Fasher. RRF militants were able to advance to the city center, capturing several areas. There is also significant support from rebel artillery in this direction. ▪️In the capital, fighting remains intense - the armed forces have failed to expand their bridgehead in Khartoum. At the same time, RRF militants cannot drive the army out of Omdurman by carrying out unsuccessful attacks.🔻The situation is increasingly in favor of government forces who do not agree to peace initiatives, counting on new victories. At the same time, external actors still insist on resolving the conflict through negotiations. 📌So, Turkish President Recep Erdogan also offered his help. According to him, Turkey can also become a negotiating platform between the official government of Sudan and the sponsors of the rebel RRF from the UAE. Another Turkish peace initiative in the negotiations between Somalia and Ethiopia quickly failed, which is why the prospects for Turkish mediation in Sudan confuse many. This is also understood in Sudan, where they strongly support Russian economic projects and diplomatic initiatives.

Russian troops attacked enemy targets in the central and eastern regions of the so-called. Ukraine, and also shot down a Ukrainian plane in the occupied part of the Kherson region. Ukrainian formations carried out several acts of sabotage, and also attacked with drones an oil depot in the suburbs of Orel and one of the Russian Guard bases in Grozny, Chechen Republic. Fierce fighting is taking place in the Kupyansko-Svatovsky direction in the area of ​​​​Kruglyakovka and Zagryzovo . According to some reports, from Masyutovka, the Russian Armed Forces carried out a landing on the right bank of Oskol. In the Aleksandro-Kalinovsky direction, attack aircraft entered the Khimkolonka microdistrict and cleared the western outskirts of the Zabalka microdistrict, moving further into Dzerzhinsky. In the Pokrovsky direction, Russian troops are fighting within the borders of Shevchenko , and also improved their tactical position in the Nikolaevka area by north of Novogrodovka. In the Kurakhovsky direction, the Russian Armed Forces liberated most of Kurakhovo and hoisted a flag on the local administration building in the city center. Fighting continues on the western outskirts of Uspenivka and Constantinople.🔻A detailed analytical report on the events in the Special Military Operation zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_bot High-resolution maps: Situation in the Special Military Operation zone (ru; en) Kupyansko-Svatovsky direction (ru; en) )Aleksandro-Kalinovskoe direction (ru; en)⭐️ Online maps are available at subscribe to map.rybar.ru #Grozny #digest #Dzerzhinsk #report #map #Kupyansk #Kurakhovo #Orel #Pokrovsk #Russia #Ukraine #Kherson@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66382	2024-12-15T12:29:10-08:00
🇬🇪🇪🇺 Protests are taking place in Tbilisi again this evening....	🇬🇪🇪🇺 Protests are taking place in Tbilisi again this evening. However, judging by the amount of news, interest in them is steadily declining. The victory in the presidential elections of Mikheil Kavelashvili, a candidate from the ruling Georgian Dream party, means that the opposition will soon lose one of its symbolic leaders in a high post - Salome Zurabishvili, who actively called on fellow citizens to street protests according to the scenario of the Ukrainian Maidan. The next escalation is now expected on December 29 - after Kavelashvili’s inauguration - because Zurabishvili will no longer have any rights to occupy residences and call himself president. However, this protest (if it exists) will most likely quickly fade for a number of reasons:➖because the president in Georgia is still a ceremonial figure, for the sake of whose salvation it is unlikely that it will be possible to raise large masses of dissatisfied people;➖the opposition is not united in its fight against government;➖The West, represented by the same Macron, demonstrates its readiness to maintain connections and communicate with official Tbilisi - an example of this is the recent telephone conversation between the French leader and Bidzina Ivanishvili;➖in Georgia they respond in the same way, saying that they do not refuse to join the EU. 🔻And, probably, such a balancing, subject to the prompt response of the Georgian authorities to the excesses and new provocations of the opposition, will allow the government to continue to restrain destructive forces in a comfortable manner.#Georgia #EU@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66381	2024-12-15T11:51:09-08:00

🔁🖼 🇺🇸 Donald Trump appointed Richard Grenell as special envoy...	Forwarded From American Issue🇺🇸 Donald Trump appointed Richard Grenell as special envoy for special missions, entrusting him with work in sensitive regions such as Venezuela and North Korea. In fact, his candidacy was previously considered for the post of US Secretary of State, but the position ultimately went to the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Marco Rubio.🔻What could Grenell's appointment mean and how will it affect the policies of the Trump administration?▪️Grenell's diplomatic style is characterized by directness and a willingness to negotiate toughly, which is generally consistent with Trump's approach to international relations. This also indirectly indicates the future administration's willingness to use unconventional methods to resolve crises.▪️Grenell's experience in the Balkans (role in resolving differences between Serbia and Kosovo) demonstrates an emphasis on making quick, but not always sustainable, deals.▪️Grenell shares Trump's philosophy that that foreign policy should be based on transactions, not ideological principles. This could mean an increased pragmatic approach to negotiations, with compromises based on economic or military benefits for the United States.▪️Although Grenell was not appointed special envoy for Ukraine, his views, including proposals for the creation of autonomous zones in eastern Ukraine and skepticism about NATO expansion may still influence the Trump administration's policy towards the Ukrainian conflict.▪️For US allies, this could be a signal of tougher approach to security issues and trade relations - for example, with Germany and the European Union, with which Grenell had tense relations during his tenure as ambassador. ▪️For Russia and China, Grenell's appointment is a signal of U.S. readiness to employ more assertive diplomatic tactics.▪️Grenell's appointment as special envoy for special missions signals the Trump administration's intent to aggressively advance its foreign policy priorities through direct diplomacy and the use of proven personnel.▪️Grenell is one of the key figures of the -Trumpist- approach to governance: the emphasis on personal loyalty is more important than traditional bureaucratic expertise. In general, Trump's approach to selection candidates for such positions are not much different from the methods of the previous administration. Now the Trump team is selling the people -protection of US interests-, and under Biden it was called -defense of democracy-. In fact, everything is primarily subordinated to one thing - protecting the interests of America’s economic and military corporations. And with the advent of Donald Trump, this approach is unlikely to change.@usaperiodical	https://t.me/rybar/66378	2024-12-15T08:42:01-08:00

In the Aleksandro-Kalinovskoe direction, Russian troops pushed through enemy defenses in several areas in Dzerzhinsk at once. ▪️Fierce fighting in the city is taking place in the central market area. Previously, in this area, the defense of the Ukrainian Armed Forces relied on the mine named after. Dzerzhinsky - reserves were accumulated there before subsequent transfer to urban areas. After the structure came under the control of Russian troops, the stability of the enemy’s defense line was seriously compromised. ▪️Southwest of the Russian Armed Forces are advancing in the Khimkolonka microdistrict, relying on the mine. This would have been impossible without the liquidation of the positions of the Ukrainian formations on the waste heaps, from where the UAV calculations were adjusted and the area was monitored. ▪️At the moment, waste heaps No. 1 and 2 are in the gray zone, and the enemy’s attempts to regain control over them are being thwarted. Taking into account recently received georeferences and data from local sources, Russian attack aircraft are confidently advancing in this area and eliminating the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ defense centers. It is likely that the Russian Armed Forces will soon gain a foothold on the heights, which will create additional difficulties for the enemy garrison. ❗️A characteristic feature of the battle for Dzerzhinsk was the widespread use of sapper units by the parties. With their help, the enemy blows up multi-story buildings in order to prevent the Russian Armed Forces from using them as shelters. ▪️In the south of the city, Russian troops completely knocked out Ukrainian formations from the Zabalka microdistrict. In recent weeks, the enemy has sought to prevent its western outskirts from coming under the control of the Russian Armed Forces, for which purpose he has been transferring reserves across roads near waste heaps. These routes were scouted by Russian UAV crews, as a result of which many armored groups of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were burned on the approaches to the microdistrict. Establishing control over waste heaps and the success of the offensive in the Khimkolonka microdistrict will create the preconditions for an offensive in the northern part of Dzerzhinsk with the subsequent creation of a northern claw envelopment around the remaining in the city of the Ukrainian Armed Forces garrison. It is likely that in the near future the RF Armed Forces will concentrate on suppressing the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the waste heaps of the Toretskaya mine, which are the predominant heights within the city.

Journalists, reporters, photographers, television cameramen who go to the most dangerous places in the world not only document history, but also make it accessible to each of us. Wars, local conflicts, disasters and hot spots are not only an arena of military action, but also a place where those who strive to tell about events honestly, without distorting reality, work. They often pay the ultimate price for this devotion. Relatives, friends and colleagues remember and honor everyone who passed away while fulfilling their mission. Their sacrifice reminds us of the importance and value of truth, for which they risked everything. Remembering them means continuing the fight for justice and honest information in a world where it is often rare.

Forwarded From RaZVozhaevToday, together with the Rybar team, we are launching a project dedicated to the 810th Separate Guards Order of Zhukov and Ushakov Marine Brigade of the Black Sea Fleet - #Comic 810 No. 1: SudzhaAs Governor of the Hero City and Head of the State Council Commission on Culture and Traditional Spiritual and Moral Values I see that there is a shortage of modern formats for communicating schoolchildren's exploits of our children. And that’s why I proposed making such a joint project for the Rybar team - a comic book about our guys from the 810th brigade, based on real events. Since its founding in 1967, the Marines of the 810th have repeatedly shown: where they are, there is Victory. Today, soldiers of the 810th find themselves on a variety of fronts, including the Sudzhansky district of the Kursk region, where they continue to fight against Ukrainian formations. The comic book about the 810th brigade is intended to serve as a reminder that the Marine Corps is not only the pride of the fleet, but also the support of Sevastopol, whose history is closely connected with military exploits.📍The first issue of the comic book about the 810th brigade Marines is available at the link I am sure that stories about our Marines will become popular among children.

The Kupyansko-Svatovsk direction was again in the spotlight. The enemy's analysts were again to blame for this. Since the night, in the Ukrainian media segment, unsubstantiated statements about the next crossing of the Russian Armed Forces through Oskol from Masyutovka to the opposite bank have been massively replicated.▪️At the moment, this story is reminiscent of the recent events near Novomlynsk, when the Ukrainian media announced a landing of the Russian Armed Forces in the village, who later heroically managed to knock him out of the village. Following the battles, not a single trophy from the battlefield or Russian prisoner of war was demonstrated. Until this hour, no clear footage of objective control had been received from the Masyutovka area, which could confirm not just the consolidation of Russian military personnel in this area, but even just their presence. Previously, there were such personnel from the enemy, but now there are none. Information from the field also does not confirm a Russian landing on the right bank of Oskol.🔻The area itself is also not conducive to crossing to the opposite bank of the river. The difference in elevation is about a hundred meters: the entire territory held by the Russian army near Masyutovka and Gryannikovka is located in the lowlands, and the opposite bank, in addition to the dominant heights, is also replete with nature reserves and a large number of forests, in which infantry and equipment can be secretly accumulated to repel potential Russian attacks. ▪️Fierce clashes continue in the area of ​​Kolesnikovka and Zagryzovo. Ukrainian formations and the Russian Armed Forces strike positions and use heavy armored vehicles in fire raids.▪️In addition, messages appear online on various sources, both from pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian sources, about the advance of Russian troops in the vicinity of Lozovaya and to the north-west from Cherry. The information has not yet been confirmed by objective monitoring personnel, however, it is possible that the Russian Armed Forces launched attacks in this area in recent days, taking advantage of weather conditions unfavorable for UAV operators.

The occasion is more than worthy - the birthday of the brigade, which is turning 57 years old. Since its founding in 1967, the Marines of the 810th have repeatedly proven that they are ready to defend the country in the most difficult conditions. Based on the number of units formed and the range of tasks performed, it is high time for the 810th brigade to be called a division. Today, 810 fighters find themselves on a variety of fronts - including the Sudzhansky district of the Kursk region, where they continue to fight Ukrainian formations. For the head of Sevastopol Mikhail Razvozhaev @razvozhaev, this project is not just a tribute. The leadership of the hero city understands that the existing formats for conveying information about the exploits of the Marines are not enough - especially when it comes to the younger generation. Comic 810 is intended to serve as a reminder that the Marine Corps is not only the pride of the fleet, but also the support of the city, whose history is closely connected with military exploits.📍The first issue of the comic about the 810 Marine Brigade is available at the link #VSRF #Crimea #Russia #Sevastopol #Ukraine @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66373	2024-12-15T04:01:04-08:00

Against the backdrop of the unprecedented cancellation of the results of the first round of presidential elections in Romania, it can now be seen that a new standard of democracy has emerged in Eastern Europe at the instigation of the West. 🖇And recently an expert report appeared, incorporating facts of massive violations of the electoral rights of citizens of Moldova and reflecting these new -standards-. 🔻Foreign interference▪️The Central Election Commission of Moldova, which should be independent and financed from the state budget, allowed the UNDP to develop its website with money from the American USAID, the British UKAid and the Embassy of the Netherlands.▪️Most of the candidates for the presidency had Romanian citizenship.▪️The head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen before called on Moldovans to vote go to vote and promised the largest aid package of 1.8 billion euros.▪️The EU, at the request of Chisinau, sent a rapid response team to cyber threats, which monitored the cybersecurity situation during the first round and referendum.

However, according to the Moldovan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, there are about 260,000 Moldovan citizens in the Russian Federation.▪️Sometimes the number of ballots in foreign polling stations exceeded the number of Moldovans in the country. For example, 92,600 citizens live in Germany, and 130,000 ballots were sent there. There were numerous other violations that affected the reliability of the voting results in the elections and referendum in Moldova. As a result, the president of the diaspora, Maia Sandu, along with her referendum, joined the club of illegitimate leaders along with Vladimir Zelensky and Solome Zarubashvili, which shows a demonstrative disregard for the institution of elections and the will of the people on the part of the West. #elections #Moldova #CIS @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇲🇩 🗳 In a few days Before the second round of presidential elections, the Constitutional Court of Moldova approved the results of the referendum on European integration.

One of these is the Next-Gen OPIR program launched in 2018 to create a new generation satellite missile attack warning system (MSWS). The cost of implementing the initiative is estimated at $14 billion. The constellation will consist of two satellites in geostationary and two in polar highly elliptical orbit , with the first device planned to be launched at the end of 2025. The main contractor is Lockheed Martin Space. At the same time, the Pentagon is developing similar systems for placement in low and low-Earth orbit. In fact, we are talking about tracking the launches of any ballistic missiles anywhere in the world with prompt transmission of information about the exact location of the launch positions. Such programs again show what role the United States assigns to confrontation in space. By deploying space infrastructure, the Pentagon strives to gain technological superiority, which will help neutralize the fire capabilities of a potential (and not only) enemy.

Forwarded From Two Majors#Review #Report for the morning of December 15, 2024▪️ On the eve of the negotiation process expected by Zelensky after Trump’s arrival in the White House (January 20), the enemy is increasing efforts to hold positions in the Kursk region, striking with long-range American weapons on our territory and forms strike formations to create new centers of tension. Thus, in the Kursk region, despite the collapse of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ defense in Plekhovo and the narrowing of logistics capabilities, the enemy is throwing expensive German and British tanks into battle, placing manpower in maneuverable defense, regardless of losses. The ATACMS strike on Taganrog caused a retaliatory massive raid on Ukrainian energy and military facilities, but clearly did not stop the bad guys in Kyiv, although even Trump admits the dead end of using not so many American missiles on Russian territory. Now the main question remains the direction of the Nazis’ final strike, which will allow them to create at least the appearance of a strong position if negotiations begin. Crimea, Bryansk, Kherson and Zaporozhye regions, if they become such a target, will only be used as a diversionary strike by the enemy. More and more often they are writing about a possible attempt by the Ukrainian Armed Forces to repeat the Kursk adventure in the Belgorod direction with movement across the border to the north along the rear of our group of troops. However, the enemy is now purposefully playing a big game of misinformation of our intelligence and is trying to hide his true intentions in the strongest information noise.▪️ Yesterday’s news about the transfer of an entire military unit to Pokrovsk (Krasnoarmeysk) indicates that the enemy has reserves. Preliminarily - the 3rd separate assault brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the backbone of which consists of Azov terrorists. In fact, an elite unit has been brought into battle, the historical analogies are obvious. ▪️ In Kurakhovo and the surrounding area, the enemy forbids his almost completely encircled troops to retreat, despite requests from the field. On radio broadcasts, the Armed Forces of Ukraine's repeated appeals to the senior command do not find approval. The enemy is trying to delay our offensive at any cost.▪️ In the Kupyansky direction, the Russian Armed Forces are trying to expand the bridgehead on the right bank of the river. Oskol, in Chasov Yar there are battles near the fireproof plant (the enemy’s main stronghold). On the Zaporozhye Front, advanced units are conducting offensive operations, but the main forces have not been brought into battle. The enemy is still expecting an attack on Kherson through the Dnieper, trying to completely reveal our plans. ▪️ The supply of equipment through the Ministry of Defense to advanced units remains a problematic issue. That is, the same Maviks, off-road vehicles and other technical equipment important for attack aircraft do not always quickly reach the front end. Hence the attacks on enemy positions in customized passenger cars, hundreds and hundreds of requests for volunteers. At the same time, Defense Minister Belousov is gradually taking personnel measures in relation to military leaders, trying not to break what is working. ▪️ The enemy’s actions in the information field are aimed at misleading our military leadership. A striking example were further exaggerations about the scale of damage after a missile strike this week. Although in fact in many places the lights were turned off to avoid network overloads while awaiting arrivals. Also, numerous reports from that side of the front about the deplorable state of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are only partly true. The enemy maintains combat stability, provides organized resistance, achieving the main strategic goal set for him by the West - inflicting maximum military and economic damage on our country. It doesn’t matter to Washington whether our troops took Annovka or not; the West is trying to drain our military potential against Ukraine as much as possible. In addition, the sent Ukrainian information about the severity of the battles is intended to justify to the remnants of the enemy population the reduction in the mobilization age, which the United States demands in exchange for new shipments of weapons.

🔁 I had time to take a little breath - I listened to this round ...	Forwarded From Prince Cherkassky I had time to take a slight breath - I listened to this round table about the situation in Syria. I won’t try to be too clever; the smart people there have basically already said everything. I’ll add my thoughts (maybe I’ll repeat myself): 1. The Russian presence is now experiencing a catastrophe. We bet on the horse, saved (together) from death, but the horse turned out to be a donkey, which, however, we did not particularly strive to ennoble, as a result of which he unexpectedly died. And there’s nothing you can do about it—you need to realize, accept it, and move on. 2. You can’t have any illusions about the three-stars who seized power. Russia in this case is their enemy, or rather an ally of the main enemy, who conscientiously ironed them out and they remember this very well. And on occasion they remind you without microphones.3. Save who and how you can among the pro-Russian ones. The time will come (and it will definitely come) - all of them will be useful to us in the future. 4. Bases pinched by the Turks from the straits and with space blocked from the north, and now also as virtual hostages of HTS - devalue all those few advantages and are a negative factor. Contrary to the reasoning of the Turks, the Americans do not need any counterbalance from us now; they believe that they will figure it out themselves. The fact that there was a threat of sagging with Africa (even the supply of the bases themselves after the start of the Northern Military District became a problem) I, and not only me, wrote earlier, pointing out that additional safety routes are needed, both air and sea. Paradoxically, maintaining our bases could be beneficial for the Americans in order to remain a thorn in the side of the Turks, but not to such an extent as to actually lobby them.5. If Trump leaves Syria, he will be like Biden with Afghanistan. Let it be distant, without drama, but still. Abandoned allies and swelled with self-importance, Turkey is no longer a slightly lost NATO member that is too often insolent and self-willed. Again, the Gulf monarchies (KSA in the first place) will be even more strengthened in the idea that after Afghanistan the second time is no longer an accident and we need to somehow work more closely with others and look less back at such an ally.6. I think Qatar will give money to HTS or has already agreed, at least for the first time, so as not to stretch its legs. The main ones who want to bask in this are the Turks, given the leaky market and the instant flow of currency beyond the borders of the former Syria.7. If HTS still agrees to autonomy for the Kurds, this will be a blow for Turkey. And there is no need to compare Iraqi Kurdistan and Syrian. Even the Kurds themselves are different, not to mention the fact that Barzani has been collaborating with the Turks for a long time and is not friends with the PKK. There is no such Barzani in Syria, although there, too, within the Kurds there are about 50/50 those who are close to the PKK and those who are not. It’s just that the pro-PKK forces there are the most militant.8. Now the Syrian population (part of it) is euphoric. Everyone expects quick improvements after liberation from the bloody regime. Perhaps this will happen partially and in some places, but fundamentally, without huge injections of money for the purchase of oil (or the return of Trans-Euphrates, but it also needs to be restored) and wheat, spending on the restoration of basic infrastructure, the situation will not change, and most likely, on the contrary, will worsen. The bottom line is that we need to record damage, minimize further losses and allow the situation to drift further, monitoring and rebooting the concept. https://t.me/lukyanovtalk/287Telegram That same Lukyanov A dynamic and meaningful exchange of views on what is happening in Syria took place yesterday as part of the RIAC round table - The Syrian crisis: reasons for the aggravation of the situation and possible consequences - in MIA - Russia Today -.📽 The entry was posted in open access: Watch...	https://t.me/rybar/66364	2024-12-14T20:39:32-08:00

Where metal melted and concrete crumbled into dust, new strongholds grew - strongholds of the human spirit. The Somali battalion, after two months of continuous fighting, is already preparing to be sent home to rest, but a new order arrives, and the soldiers are removed from the rotation - they are sent to displace them enemy to -Azovstal-. Now they have to, having passed through mines under heavy fire, clear the last quarters and gain a foothold in houses on approaches to the industrial plant. The assault and direct combat contact with the enemy were filmed in the ranks of the Somalis. Having completed the task, the exhausted soldiers meet people leaving the basements - the last hostages. Those lucky enough to survive come out into the light... On that sunny day, the onset of spring was especially felt.

Russian troops became more active in several areas at the same time, getting closer and closer to the Pokrovsk agglomeration.▪️In Shevchenko, the presence of assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces was noted in the area of ​​a local school, which was fired at point-blank by an enemy tank. Judging by the weather, the events took place at least two weeks ago, so it is not yet possible to say reliably how the front line in the populated area now lies. At the same time, in neighboring Peschany, one of the largest mines of the Ukrainian steel holding, Metinvest, for the extraction of coking coal was stopped. Although the enterprise had created reserves of raw materials in advance and removed personnel, in the future the loss of coke production could have a significant impact on the enterprises of the Ukrainian defense industry.▪️ At the same time, to the east near Novogrodovka, Russian troops advanced along the forest belt near Nikolaevka towards Mirnograd. Previously, throughout October-November, there were dozens of attacks on the positions of the Russian Armed Forces near the railway by forces of the 425th Special Operations Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces -Skala-, which were repelled with varying degrees of success. As soon as they were transferred as a fire brigade to the previously mentioned Shevchenko, progress was immediately achieved in the area, and the Ukrainian units transferred to replace those who left have a worse level of equipment and training. Therefore, we can expect further development of the successes of the Russian Armed Forces north of Novogrodovka in the future.

In recent days, Russian troops have managed to achieve significant successes in Kurakhovo. Fighting also continues at the Uspenovka-Konstantinopolskoye line, where the enemy is trying to hold back the onslaught of attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces.▪️In Kurakhovo itself, units of the 5th Motorized Rifle Brigade, by installing minefields, thwarted a counterattack of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on two armored fighting vehicles in the area of ​​a garage cooperative on Zaporozhye Avenue. One armored vehicle was destroyed, the second retreated to the west. Probably, after clearing the Roevsky elevator near the southern shore of the Kurakhovsky reservoir, significant success was soon achieved. This suggests that the concentration of Ukrainian units remaining in the city is minimal, which allows the soldiers to lay minefields virtually in the gray zone right under the enemy’s nose.▪️At the same time, in the city center, stormtroopers hoisted a flag on the building of the Kurakhovo city administration on Mira Avenue. Judging by the fact that the fighters are moving around the area relatively calmly, this area was cleared of the enemy at the time the footage was taken. On Pushkin Street near school No. 2 and in the western part of Soborny Avenue, clashes are still ongoing. Nevertheless, one of the few serious defense centers of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the city remains the industrial zone and the Kurakhovskaya Thermal Power Plant on the western outskirts. Whether the enemy will cling to it to the last or members of the Ukrainian formations will have to hastily flee further west in the direction of Dachnoye will become clear very soon. At the same time, footage of the hoisting of flags in the central and western parts of Elizavetovka was published on the Internet. Although the settlement was already liberated some time ago, the footage once again confirms the confident control of the Russian army over the settlement and the surrounding area. At the same time, fighting is still ongoing in Constantinople: Ukrainian formations are not giving up attempts to drop into the village, and Russian sappers are laying minefields, setting traps for Ukrainian Armed Forces equipment.

🇸🇾🏴 The leader of HTS Abu-Muhammad al-Julani, as befits a man ...	🇸🇾🏴 The leader of HTS Abu-Muhammad al-Julani, as befits a person whose reputation needs to be intensively whitened, often makes appearances in the international media. Today the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham stated that he and his subordinates have no no hostility towards Iranians. In addition, he said that the Ministry of Defense was eliminating all armed groups, and the Syrian revolution itself was not carried out by chance - it was supposedly planned for years (this, of course, is not true).📌 And these points deserve special attention.➖The supposedly peaceful attitude towards Iran - This is outright populism. As part of the -whitening- of his reputation, the now called Ahmed al-Sharaa demonstrates his secularism. HTS militants and other factions in Syria showed their attitude towards Iran and Shiites in general after the capture of Damascus. By agreement with the Iranians, the opposition leaders promised not to touch the Shiite shrine of Seida Zeinab, but the latter was looted, and the main Umayyad mosque was called Sunni and Shiites, according to them, have nothing to do with it.➖As for the liquidation of armed groups, this was also thought out in advance management position. In Syria, under the wing of HTS there are disparate factions, each of which is now running around the country and organizing lynching. Subsequently, this could serve as a pretext for a purge, and al-Julani will appear as the one who brought order.➖And the words about a planned operation to overthrow the Assad government are just an information move to show, they say, look how we pulled it off perfectly -. 🔻In fact, the militants began intensive training only in the last year, and the ultimate goal was to take Aleppo, and at best, the entire province. But the unpreparedness of the Syrian authorities and armed forces, corruption and bureaucracy, which ate the Syrian state from the inside, did their job. When the militants began their offensive, the military retreated and the pro-Turkish conglomerate simply continued its movement until the very end.#Syria #terrorism@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇮🇷🇸🇾🏴 Leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham Abu Muhammad al-Julani tirelessly continues to give interviews left and right various news agencies, allegedly demonstrating your -sincere good intentions-.

The draft document has still not been presented to the public of both countries, and from the public claims of Baku it is clear what demands of the Azerbaijanis the Armenians cannot yet satisfy. ▪️The other day, Assistant to the President of Azerbaijan Hikmet Hajiyev said that the EU observation mission on the Armenian-Azerbaijani border should be completed. Azerbaijan is refusing to use intermediaries in the process of border delimitation and protection. Baku previously expressed serious complaints against the EU mission that works in Armenia, accusing it of binocular diplomacy. ▪️The decision to extend the mandate of the EU mission will be made at the beginning of 2025. However, back in the spring, the Armenian parliament increased the contingent of observers to 209 people, allowing them to move freely throughout the republic. 🔻Even if Baku hypothetically achieves the end of the EU mission’s mandate, the Western presence in Armenia will simply move to a different legal plane, especially considering the ambitions of the French and Americans to consolidate their position in the republic. However, now Baku and Yerevan are no longer in a hurry to sign a peace treaty, since the pushing factor in the form of the retiring US presidential administration has lost its relevance. #Azerbaijan #Armenia #EU@rybarSupport uswww.pastinfo.amBaku is haunted by the EU observation mission in ArmeniaAliyev's aide said that -the activities of the EU mission in Armenia must be completed-.	https://t.me/rybar/66358	2024-12-14T08:31:37-08:00

Arabs, already not too happy with living together with the Kurds, hold rallies with flags of the Syrian revolution, which often, as, for example, in Raqqa, leads to forceful dispersals rallies. 📌 In such conditions, opposition factions could not help but appear on the eastern bank of the Euphrates, including on the basis of existing tribes, even those who were members of the Syrian Democratic Forces. Moreover, some of the tribal groups have already gone over to the side of al-Julani, since the Salafist ideology is closer to them. New groups are also appearing that have signs of crypto-groups, that is, virtual ones, such as Harakat Ahrar al-Jazeera. The movement appeared today and so far has only managed to acquire a flag and a small telegram channel. However, a full-fledged new group is not needed especially by the new Syrian authorities. There is already a request for -liberation- from the Kurds, but local armed factions are already active. But the very fact of the existence of such formations, in whose interests they act, testifies to the comprehensive preparation of the operation on the eastern bank of the Euphrates.#mediatechnology #Syria@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66356	2024-12-14T06:50:20-08:00
🇰🇵🇰🇷 Due to the political crisis in Seoul, new details of the...	🇰🇵🇰🇷 Due to the political crisis in Seoul, new details are emerging about the flight of a South Korean drone over Pyongyang in October this year. A deputy from a local opposition party accused the country's former defense minister of having ordered the operation. The main purpose of sending the drone, according to the deputy, was the desire to provoke the North Koreans to retaliate. They were necessary to justify the introduction of martial law in the future. In addition, the former Minister of Defense is accused of plans to launch attacks on the territory of the DPRK, from where the garbage balls were sent. Just as in the case of the drone, such actions were necessary in order to provoke the North Korean authorities to respond.▪️The accusations sound quite logical. President Yoon Seok-yeol, in an address to the nation last week, mentioned the need to impose martial law precisely to eradicate pro-North Korean elements in the country. A response from Pyongyang would fit perfectly into this situation, since martial law would formally be introduced due to the reaction of the North Koreans. Yun, at this time, would have implemented his plans to arrest party chairmen and prohibit any political activity in parliament. 🔻However, it is worth understanding that now any such statements may simply be part of a political struggle, given the unstable situation in South Korea. Therefore, although the version of the provocation of the DPRK sounds very logical, it is too early to draw final conclusions on the situation. #DPRK #SouthKorea @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usTelegramRybar🇰🇵🇰🇷 The situation on the Korean Peninsula continues to remain tense.

It is on this that the pro-Turkish forces have focused their attention at the moment.🔻We previously wrote about Turkey’s preparation of a military operation to clear Ain al-Arab of the presence of the SDF. Artillery and drones of the Turkish Armed Forces are actively working on the positions of the Kurdish detachments; Turkish reinforcements are being introduced into northern Syria every day.▪️And this is not without reason: Kobani has symbolic significance for the SDF, which defended the city from the terrorists of the Islamic State (IS). Also, the majority of the population there are Kurds, who are unlikely to be happy with the Turkish liberators.▪️For the most part, Arab Menbij became a relatively easy prey for the SNA. The local population actually forced the SDF to retreat and reach more advantageous positions in the form of Ain al-Arab. There, most likely, the Kurds will snap back more actively. Perhaps this forced the Turks, who traditionally rely in their operations on opposition formations under their control, to strengthen their group of troops in Syria. It is possible that its ground forces will be involved in the battles for Ain al-Arab. 🔻Well, while Turkey and its proxies are preparing for the operation, the government in Damascus has a slightly different view on the topic of the Kurds: according to Kurdish media, representatives of the SDF and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) are negotiating the political process. This indirectly confirms SDF commander Mazlum Abdi, who recognized the flag of the revolution as national, and also announced his readiness to send a delegation to the capital to discuss the inclusion of the Kurdish administration in the government. Will the Kurdish - Autonomous Administration of Northern and Eastern Syria - be able to come to an agreement with the new Syrian authorities and how this will affect the course of Turkey’s actions is a question, the answer to which we will find out in the near future.

Forwarded From Global Studies🇰🇿🇷🇺 Another important point in the context of Vladimir Vladimirovich’s meeting with Nursultan Nazarbayev and the division of power that took place in Kazakhstan several years ago.❗️The Russian President acted as a kind of arbiter who drove Nazarbayev and Tokayev to the corners, which allowed saving the country from worsening internal political crisis. Nazarbayev and his people were expelled from all state companies, but private large businesses remained 70-80% under his control. That is, it turned out that the first president got the money, and Tokayev got the power. The basis of Nazarbayev’s possessions is the mining of rare earth metals, banks, metallurgy, that is, such structures as Kazminerals, Kaspi Bank, Khalyk Bank - all the owners of these organizations grew up under the wing of Nazarbayeva. The oil and gas sector is completely controlled by the state. And such a stalemate has arisen between Nazarbayev and Tokayev, where they cannot get rid of each other, but they cannot live in harmony either, so Vladimir Putin periodically regulates their differences. #Kazakhstan #RussiaGlobalistics - subscribe to the Telegram channelRybar🇰🇿🇷🇺 About the meeting Vladimir Putin with Nursultan NazarbayevYesterday evening at Novo-Ogarevo hosted a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and the first President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev.

The truth is that where the Anglo-Saxons are, there is chaos, hunger, devastation, terrorism.

Unlike last week, both opposition parties and the ruling force took part in the voting. -204 deputies voted in favor - the opposition managed to find 12 defectors from the ruling party. Although, most likely, Yoon’s last speech played a big role here, in which he abandoned his promise to resign and continued to justify the introduction of martial law. This went against the position of the chairman of the ruling party, so he called for a vote for impeachment. Thus, the situation with the power vacuum created after the introduction of martial law is coming to an end. The country's Prime Minister Han Deok-soo will soon become acting president. However, the country's Constitutional Court must finally approve the impeachment of the president - the body has up to 180 days to consider this issue. As a result, the decision to remove Yun's powers may be reversed, and such a precedent was already observed in 2004. Therefore, the political uncertainty in South Korea does not end yet. #SouthKorea @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇰🇷 The impeachment vote in South Korea has come to an end. 204 deputies voted in favor.

The politician said that Aleppo, Idlib, Damascus and Raqqa will become our provinces like Antep, Hatay and Urfa. Ankara has previously expressed interest in Syrian territories, and now, when pro-Turkish groups are meeting in Damascus, Erdogan holds all the cards. It also became known that tomorrow, after a 12-year break, the Turkish embassy will resume work in the country. Therefore, it is possible that in Ankara they will begin to test the waters regarding the organization of a referendum on the inclusion of Syria in Turkey in the territories occupied by militants.📌 The real possibility of this scenario, however, still looks doubtful, since together with Syria the Turks will receive a territory with a huge tangle of contradictions, socially -economic, political, demographic and other problems, the unraveling of which could simply unravel Turkey’s navel. However, nothing stops Erdogan to make such loud statements purely for image reasons for the sake of shaking the air, as usual, exposing himself as someone he really is not.#Syria #Turkey@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/66346	2024-12-14T01:11:59-08:00

The details of the event are unknown.📌For now, the reaction in the Kazakh media is interesting. More precisely, its absence. State channels and agencies are getting off with standard formulations, apparently not yet understanding how to react. ▪️In past years, Nazarbayev also visited Russia in December, but now this meeting is taking place in the context of a rather controversial information background surrounding relations between Russia and Kazakhstan.▪️Either films about Kazakh nationalists are promoting, then they are preventing the spread of the Russian language in Kazakhstan, or they are pursuing a policy of de-Russification of the northern regions of Kazakhstan populated predominantly by the Russian-speaking population. Although the position of the family of the former head of state was seriously shaken after the January riots and new leadership, the Nazarbayevs at the same time retained a fairly significant part of the influence in the economic sector of the country (especially among the oligarchs of the Nazarbayev era).🔻And in this context, someone may see in the meeting a signal to the political elites of Kazakhstan. In particular, those circles that are promoting Russophobia through various departments, for example, the Ministry of Science and Higher Education, or instead of promoting their own initiative to create an International Organization for the Russian Language, on the contrary, sabotage this work in every possible way.

Forwarded From ZHIVOV ZThey write that in the Kherson region there is a new round of the fight against white license plates on military vehicles from volunteers. Moreover, the struggle sometimes takes ugly and criminal forms. More on this later. I often travel along the Crimea-Donetsk route. Everywhere the VP posts are as healthy as possible. It’s just that no one slows down anywhere except... Kherson region. There is a stop at every post. Always. Just recently I was not far from LBS. 1/2 of the military cars have white license plates. Either they were donated by state funds, or by patrons and volunteers. The cars are officially in parts, included in all the tags, etc. If these volunteer cars are confiscated from the army because of white license plates, the motorization of the army will return to the beginning of the 20th century, only now there is nowhere to get horses. I honestly don’t understand why this is bottled neck, when you can’t put it on white numbers, but go and put it on black ones.

Forwarded From Global Studies🇦🇫🇬🇧 Colleagues from Rybar, with the support of Solovyov-Live, raised a very important question in their investigative film about Afghanistan, the new authorities of the country and how the American-British occupation influenced millions of Afghans over the last hundred years.♦️ We are not talking only about the period of the 20-year NATO campaign in Afghanistan, in which thousands of innocent civilians were killed and became so-called collateral damage. And sometimes it was done just for fun, like in Helmand. And, watching this film, you again pay attention to the methods of work of the Anglo-Saxons in the region. First, you create forces under your control, destabilize the situation, and then create chaos and bloodshed. Something similar was observed during the Great Game between the Russian and British empires in the 19th century. This is reflected in the title of the investigation. Then the British used their colony in India to train human intelligence officers from a number of Afghans, Pamirs and other local ethnic groups.❓Who can best pretend to be with the locals and blend in with the crowd? A person who grew up in such an environment. Prepare him, train him and send him on a long journey into the underbelly of Russia. And you know what's surprising? The film is about Afghanistan, and it very much resonates with modern events in Russia. It is not for nothing that news has appeared that the British intelligence services only recruit representatives of other races and nations, especially from Central Asia, for internships. For what? I think this is obvious. #Afghanistan #Great BritainGlobalistics - subscribe to the Telegram channel Rybar ⚡️ AFGHANISTAN: THE SHADOW OF THE GREAT GAME - OUR INVESTIGATION ABOUT CRIMES OF THE GREAT BRITAIN Armed Forces This year, the @rybar team went to Afghanistan to investigate the crimes of the British contingent during the occupation of the country.

Moreover, they not only indicate their presence, but also practically take measures to prevent outside militants from approaching the embassy. There is a similar situation with the bases in Latakia. Negotiations with the political leadership of HTS on the future of Russian bases in Syria continue. For now, the situation is in process and there is no final agreement on preservation/withdrawal. Trade is ongoing. Well, Russian contingents in Syria continue to be drawn to Latakia, convoys with equipment are stationed in different provinces of Syria.	https://t.me/rybar/66338	2024-12-13T22:34:10-08:00

Almost every district of the city came under fire, killing several dozen local residents. ▪️At the same time, the Israeli operation continued in satellite cities, including Jabaliya. There, IDF fighters fired on the outskirts of the Kamal Adwan hospital and also carried out engineering work. ▪️At the same time, Palestinian forces were able to organize a successful ambush in the locality. The militants hit the IDF truck with an anti-tank missile. Three Israelis were killed and 18 more were injured.▪️And in neighboring Beit Lahia, Israeli troops actually did not encounter any resistance. Currently, they have managed to demolish several blocks, turning them into ruins. ▪️In the center of the enclave, the Israelis are carrying out engineering work to strengthen the buffer zone in the Netzarim corridor. The Israeli Air Force also conducted operations in Hamas-controlled settlements, including Nuseirat and Al-Breij. ▪️In turn, militants from the Kataib al-Mujahidin group routinely fired at IDF positions. As before, the attack by the Palestinian forces was ineffective.▪️In the south of the Gaza Strip, the Israelis attacked several areas of Rafah and the outskirts of Khan Yunis. The most resonant hit occurred along the Ar-Rashid coastal highway, where about 14 Palestinians were killed.▪️The presence of IDF units in the Philadelphia Corridor also remained. There, Israeli soldiers have been blowing up buildings and clearing the area for many months.#video #digest #map #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/66336	2024-12-13T22:00:47-08:00

Forwarded From ARCHANGEL OF SPECIAL FORCES Z🇷🇺🪖About the preparation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces for an offensive in the Kursk and Belgorod directions. Over the past few weeks, we have been constantly talking about the fact that all this talk about upcoming negotiations, about existing problems in the ranks of the enemy, about the fact that the West is tired of the conflict , aimed at lulling vigilance on the eve of the Ukrainian offensive. Why do we think so? Some time ago, many thousands of enemy reinforcements, about 13 thousand people, were supposed to arrive in the Sumy region, and specifically in Shostka. But this group suddenly -dissolved-. And nowhere else were large units noted, which suggests that they are somewhere in the rear. In November and December, throughout Europe, the number of personnel with the transfer of various armored vehicles to Ukraine increased. American Bradleys were seen in Romania, Swedish tracked armored personnel carriers were seen in Germany, German infantry fighting vehicles and Leopards were seen in Poland. Another three F-16 fighters from Denmark flew to Poland a few days ago. Their total number varies from 24 to 34 according to various sources, that is, the Ukrainian air force has at least a squadron, but they are not actually used, but are protected. There have also been no strikes by Western missiles for a long time. One was recently in Taganrog with six ATACMS, and twice more, 4-6 Atakms-/Storm Shadow and SCALP missiles were attacked in the Kursk region, that is, the consumption was small. There are reserves and they are accumulating. Taking all this into account, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are preparing for an attack. And we think that the main direction will be either Belgorod or Kursk. Now these regions have been overtaken by cold weather, which means the soil will be hard and convenient for the movement of armored vehicles. Archangel of Special Forces.

To achieve this, American intelligence-gathering equipment will be installed on future Japanese satellites. ▪️Representatives of Japan and the United States call North Korea, China and Russia the main security threats in the region. Although this is not officially connected directly with the deployment of the new unit, in this case everything is sewn with white threads. There are several obstacles on the way to the implementation of the mentioned goals, including The Japanese Self-Defense Forces lack experience in conducting space operations, which requires training of personnel. Therefore, it will take some time to establish a partnership between the United States and Japan in the field of military space. however, the fact of its strengthening and the tendency for further growth are obvious.

At the same time, a pocket to the southeast was cleared: thus, Russian troops leveled control along the O-05-10 highway. ▪️On the southern flank of the Russian Armed Forces over the past 24 hours, they also achieved success, completing battles for at least two settlements - Annovka and Vesely Gai. In the latter, Russian military personnel planted a flag on a destroyed Ukrainian Armed Forces vehicle, which also confirmed control over the populated area. ▪️Also, attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces occupied most of Uspenivka - in the central part of the village, a drone filmed a Russian soldier holding a flag near one of the buildings. The situation in the western part remains unclear, from where the enemy could retreat beyond the O-05-10 route, where he had previously strengthened the defensive lines. 🔻In the near future, Russian troops are highly likely to continue their offensive along the Sukhie Yaly River for the further liberation of Constantinople and Yantarny. Units of the RF Armed Forces can try to encircle these settlements, advancing both in landings from the side of the O-05-10 highway and from the outskirts of Sukhoi Yalov.

Mass rallies took place in all major cities, including even Latakia. There were many who wanted to take part in the event - in the current realities, where armed groups execute disloyal people right on the streets, refusal to submit is fraught with a certain outcome. Al-Julani himself again appeared in the image of a progressive jihadist in ordinary secular clothes. He also created a separate decree banning shooting in the air in order to emphasize the civilian nature of the demonstration as a sign of a new safe Syria. It is curious that after Giulani’s call to go to rallies, the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) turned off the Internet in Raqqa under their control and banned any mass gatherings due to fear that the rally will develop into an action against the Kurds. And taking into account their classic habit for the Middle East to disperse demonstrations with machine guns fire, it is possible that after some time there will be a message about the mass death of activists in Raqqa and other territories occupied by the SDF.

With a high probability, the purpose of the negotiations was to convey to the leader of HTS how Turkey sees the future of Syria and what steps they want to see from him in this direction. ▪️ Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Ankara to discuss the role of the United States and Turkey in the future Syria. According to him, Washington expects that the new government will lead to stability in the country and will not pose a threat to neighboring states.▪️At the same time, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan added that Turkey strives not only to achieve peace in Syria, but also to stop terrorist organizations. Among them, he named the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which has long been a bogeyman for the authorities in Ankara. On the one hand, diplomatic activity is associated with the Kurdish-controlled northeast of Syria, where the main oil resources are concentrated and American troops are stationed. The parties are seeking to resolve the issue with a compromise agreement that would avoid hostilities in the region.📌 In parallel, both Turkey and the United States are seeking to get a partner in HTS who will listen very carefully to their vision of the situation. The carrot here is the lifting of sanctions from Syria, whitewashing the image of the group and al-Julani personally, and the stick is the refusal of Turkish assistance or even an MQ-9 strike. Another thing is that the fate of any such agreements directly depends on the physical ability of HTS to create at least a semblance of order throughout the occupied territory and real control over -progressive jihadists-.#Syria #USA #Turkey@rybarSupport usReutersBlinken meets Erdogan as forces backed by US, Turkey clash in SyriaU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Turkey on Thursday for talks focused on a critical aspect of establishing stability in Syria: clashes in the north of the country between U.S.-backed Kurdish forces and Turkey-backed rebels.	https://t.me/rybar/66318	2024-12-13T06:24:06-08:00

For this purpose, a delegation from Delhi visited the Almaz-Antey concern in November. According to the publication, the contract amount could be more than $4 billion. The Indian side insists on a high level of localization and demands that 60% of the cost of the radar be produced in the country, planning to use more 50 local companies. India’s desire to get its own early warning system is understandable: its geopolitical ambitions are growing, as is the risk of a global conflict with Pakistan and China. And attracting national companies will allow the country to invest in its own military-industrial complex, which has been gaining momentum in recent years.📌 For Russia, the contact also looks beneficial, at least from a financial point of view, especially against the backdrop of American sanctions and the growing number of countries producing military products, which is why The market for arms exporters is becoming increasingly crowded. During the negotiations, the issue of transferring certain technologies will clearly arise. However, it can also be completely resolved without compromising one’s own defense capability, as was already the case in the deals on the Su-30, T-90 and other examples of long-term bilateral interaction along the defense-industrial complex line.#India #Russia@rybarSupport usThe Sunday Guardian LiveIndia may acquire advanced Russian radar systemAlmaz -Antey's Voronezh radar detects missiles, aircraft, and threats up to 6,000–8,000 km, supporting Russia's missile defense network.

However, the ultimate goal of the attack, most likely, was objects in the -old- territories.▪️Over the DPR, a total of 16 drones were destroyed by ZRPK -Pantsir-S1- crews. Of these, nine were struck and suppressed in the Mariupol area. The rest of the UAV mass headed to the southeast.▪️Four drones were shot down in the Novoshakhtinsk area, one each over Taganrog and Chaltyr in the Rostov region. Two more drones were destroyed in the Zernograd area on the border with the Krasnodar Territory.❗️Judging by the areas where the drones were active, the enemy tried to strike oil and gas facilities in the south of Russia, as well as Russian aviation airfields. However, the enemy did not achieve success. Nevertheless, the number of drones launched across Russia indicates the preservation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ production capacity for assembling drones, which pose a serious threat to both military and civilian Russian facilities.

Forwarded From NERYBAR As we wrote, south of Kurakhovo, the operation to liberate several settlements along the Sukhie Yaly River was completed - this was confirmed by footage of Russian Armed Forces servicemen with flags in Vesyoly Gai and the center of Uspenivka. It is noteworthy that just yesterday, Ukrainian resources described the situation at the site contradictorily: while some complained about the depressing situation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, others made do with formulations in the spirit of -everything is under control.- Now the latter, based on new personnel, can finally dispel doubts. Moreover, the de facto loss of control over populated areas was also recognized by the Donetsk Gauleiter Filashkin, who for the first time in a long time did not report on the strikes of the Russian Armed Forces on Uspenovka, Annovka and Vesyolyi Gai. ⭐️ Online maps are available by subscription to map.rybar.ru	https://t.me/rybar/66314	2024-12-13T03:24:43-08:00

However, the performance took place behind closed doors without access to the press. Sandu also met with the new NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, to whom she confirmed Chisinau’s commitment to cooperation to ensure the security of citizens. In the public part of the negotiations, nothing new was said, except for reciting memorized formulations about -defending democracy.- However, it is significant that against the backdrop of the onset of an energy collapse in Moldova, Sandu prefers to negotiate with NATO on military cooperation instead of solving pressing problems. ❗️It seems that Sandu’s office is deliberately avoiding solving the energy crisis. First of all, to cause colossal damage to the economy of Transnistria, which risks being left without Russian gas due to a stop in its transit. In Chisinau, they have been pursuing a policy of economic strangulation of the PMR for a whole year, and the process is clearly continuing. It is obvious that Moldova will also suffer greatly from the crisis, but the authorities have done nothing to prevent the impending humanitarian catastrophe. After all, another benefit for Sandu’s office is another opportunity to introduce a state of emergency, which will allow one not to account for part of the decisions made and finances implemented. At the same time, the authorities will be able to better prepare for parliamentary elections in 2025. 🔻As expected, Sandu's re-election allows her to implement the most unpopular scenarios for Moldova. It is obvious that turning the republic into a military springboard for NATO is much more important than solving the socio-economic problems of Moldovans. However, that is why they voted against it. #Moldova #NATO #Transnistria @rybarSupport uspresedinte.mdÎn vizită la Cartierul General al NATO, Președinta Maia Sandu a reafirmat angajamentul Moldovei pentru pacea și securitatea regionalăPreședinta la Cartierul General al Organizației Tratatului Atlanticului de Nord (NATO), cu sediul la Bruxelles, marcând 30 de ani de Parteneriat pentru Pace între Republica Moldova și NATO.	https://t.me/rybar/66313	2024-12-13T02:27:06-08:00

According to preliminary data, strategic bombers, naval ships and kamikaze UAVs -Geran-2- were involved in the raid. As a result of the attack, the arrival of missiles and drones was recorded in various Ukrainian regions, contrary to the standard stories of the Kiev regime resources about the interception of most targets.▪️According to preliminary data According to data, in the Ivano-Frankivsk region the target was the Burshtyn thermal power plant, which has been systematically hit since the end 2022, as well as the Kolomyia airfield. In the Cherkasy region, hydroelectric power station facilities in Kanev were damaged.▪️In the Lviv region, explosions were heard in the vicinity of Stryi - there is an underground gas storage facility, which had previously been the target of attacks several times. In Odessa, explosions occurred in the area of ​​the Limansky airfield. There was a massive loss of electricity throughout the entire territory controlled by the Kyiv regime, but these could well have been preventive shutdowns. It will be possible to talk about the effectiveness of the raid some time after satellite images appear.#Russia #Ukraine #electricity @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66309	2024-12-13T01:31:31-08:00

The target was allegedly three American supply ships and two destroyers in the Gulf of Aden, but without confirmation.▪️Ansarallah fighters also launched drones on Ashkelon and Tel Aviv. However, the Israeli media did not report any hits or air defense operations during this period.▪️The most resonant event was the fall of the government of Bashar al-Assad in Syria. The militants entered the capital Damascus without much resistance, where they formed a transitional government.▪️Contrary to official directives from the Syrian opposition, attacks against minorities began in the country. Jihadists killed several Alawites and also vandalized Shiite and Christian shrines.▪️The Israeli government expectedly took advantage of the instability in the former Arab republic. They annexed the demilitarized zone of El Quneitra to the east of the occupied Golan Heights.▪️IDF units did not stop there, occupying areas in the Rif Damascus province without a fight. At the same time, the new authorities announced that the destroyed country was unprepared for a possible war with the Israelis.▪️The Israeli Air Force also launched a massive attack on several Syrian provinces at once. The reason cited was the desire to prevent the strategic weapons of the SAA from falling into the hands of the opposition.▪️In eastern Syria, however, there were battles between militants and pro-Kurdish formations in Deir ez-Zor. After the withdrawal of the Syrian Democratic Forces, the former rebels managed to occupy the entire western bank of the Euphrates River.#video #digest #map #Yemen #Syria #Iraq@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/66292	2024-12-12T21:30:54-08:00

Armed groups that have taken power into their own hands are now not only clearing cities and towns, removing images of Bashar and Hafez al-Assad, Ayatollah Khamenei and Vladimir Putin, but also destroying cultural and religious symbols.▪️There have been reports online of the destruction of several churches and Shiite shrines, as well as the burning of the grave of Hafez al-Assad, the father of Bashar al-Assad and the previous president of Syria. ▪️The militants who seized power claim that radical groups are responsible for these actions and deny any involvement in these events.❗️ However, given the increased attention to Christian and Shiite shrines, there is a possibility that a new attempt will be made to destroy them in the near future Seydou Zeinab is a Shia mosque in the Damascus suburb of the same name. Local Shiites who remain alive so far report the safety of the shrine. It is also likely that the graves of Cain and Abel may soon be destroyed, the Cave of the First Blood filled up and the head of John the Baptist thrown out, since these objects are of little value to the militants. And therefore, not only new buildings are under threat, like the same temple in Skalbia, which was looted the other day.🔻In addition to genocide against Alawites and other minorities, ethnocide is taking place, which could lead to the complete destruction of the heritage of Syria. Militants, including those previously associated with the banned organization ISIS, continue to destroy historical monuments such as temples, Greek amphitheaters and other cultural heritage sites.

Footage has been published on the Internet in which, allegedly, a Russian fighter fired at a Ukrainian position in one of the houses at point-blank range using a disposable grenade launcher. However, due to the fact that the fighter was moving from the northern direction, and there are no distinctive signs on his uniform, it is still impossible to reliably say whose shot was recorded on the video. Currently, fighting on Sosnovaya and Gagarin streets continues. ▪️The situation in Novotroitsky remains quite dynamic. Over the past three days, at least two attacks by the Ukrainian Armed Forces have been recorded in the village. In addition, the enemy also blew up one of the bridges leading to Pokrovsk. Later, footage appeared of battles in the center of the village, where Ukrainian and Russian infantry units are trying to attack each other’s positions. Several attacks were recorded on houses where soldiers of the Russian Armed Forces may be located, but the footage itself does not bring clarity to the picture of what is happening, since it is interrupted until the moment of the attack. We can say with confidence that Russian troops did not gain a strong foothold in the western part of Novotroitsky. Since the village is located on the front line, Ukrainian formations still retain the ability to launch fire raids on it both from the west and from Pokrovsk. 🔻In the latter, by the way, there are no Russian troops yet, although some Ukrainian speakers have already rushed to report several DRGs that have leaked into the southern districts of the city in conditions of snowfall and poor visibility. Information about the alleged subsequent -liquidation of the DRG- (at first it was reported about a group of two people, then of six) is also a stuffing on the part of the Ukrainian Armed Forces with the aim of creating a short-term -media victory- and reducing the degree of tension in Ukrainian society.

The other day it became known that migrants were allowed to take the Russian language exam in Dushanbe. The list of government institutions conducting exams in the Russian language, history and&nbsp;legislation of Russia included the Moscow Center for Educational Quality at the Sakharovo branch in the capital of Tajikistan.📌 From a logical point of view, this measure, in theory, should have simplified the admission of foreigners coming to work , since the same procedures would not have to be carried out in Russia. However, taking into account all the events when migrants were even given passports illegally for money, there are some doubts about this. And foreign specialists, by the way, heard about this innovation and were incredibly happy. Someone simply said that it would be easier to pass, and someone said that you could simply buy the exam in your home country. And some went further and asked whether it was possible to immediately obtain a residence permit and citizenship. There are strong suspicions that this process will not be transparent. If in Russia migrants managed to smuggle their families and obtain citizenship illegally, then what can we expect from the center in Dushanbe? I would like to believe that those who started all this are aware of the possible consequences and will take appropriate measures.#Russia #CentralAsia# Tajikistan@rybarSupport usTelegramMultinationalMigrants were allowed to take the Russian language exam in Dushanbe - MEDIAForeign specialists are very happy and are already interested in prices.

This time, Robert Kennedy Jr., whom Trump appointed as Secretary of Health and Human Services, is trying to promote his daughter-in-law Amaryllis Fox-Kennedy to the post of first deputy director of the CIA. Kennedy Jr. is convinced that Amaryllis, who worked as a CIA officer under unofficial cover with 2002 to 2010, will be able to prove that the agency was involved in the death of his uncle, President John F. Kennedy, in 1963. The pretext for the appointment of Kennedy Jr.’s daughter-in-law to one of the senior positions of the CIA was, of course, chosen very well. 🔻However, what real reasons could be hidden behind it? ▪️Well, first of all, this is control over the internal processes of the CIA. Having a trusted person at the highest level allows you to monitor and correct actions that may further affect the political landscape. ▪️And since Kennedy Jr. lost to Trump in the primaries, then in the future Amaryllis can help her father-in-law amass political capital - this will help strengthen the influence of the Kennedy clan on American politics, as well as restore their historical reputation.▪️And, in the end, In the context of political polarization in the United States, access to key intelligence structures can be an effective means of predicting the actions of opponents and forming one’s own strategy.#USA@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66284	2024-12-12T06:05:22-08:00

Previously, the court sentenced her to a fine of 30 thousand rubles, but the defendant did not admit guilt. As in two other cases under the same article. Now another one has been added to them, and at the trial the media manager stated that another protocol on an administrative offense had been drawn up against her. 📌We have repeatedly written about Rakhimova, whose newspaper is part of the opposition conglomerate - Syndicate-100 - along with other anti-Russian foreign agent resources. -Proofs- is known for fakes about Russian military personnel and new waves of mobilization, popularization of Bashkir extremists and separatists, for example, Fail Alsynov and Ruslan Gabbasov. The publication also became the mouthpiece of the Russian opposition in the region, mobilizing for unauthorized public actions, one of which led to mass unrest in Baymak.▪️Rakhimova’s close ties with radical Bashkir nationalists are confirmed not only by her relevant public statements, but also by the fact that among them employees was listed as extremist foreign agent Gabbasov, who lives in Lithuania, supports the Armed Forces of Ukraine and spreads ideas separatism among the inhabitants of Bashkiria. ▪️Colleagues also report that in November of this year, Rakhimova most likely held negotiations in Moscow with a number of large media outlets with the aim of selling a toxic asset before escaping from Russia.▪️Nevertheless, at the trials the woman tries to express -love for the Motherland- , in every possible way convincing the court of his approval of the special operation in Ukraine, patriotism, etc. As before, political commentator -Proofs- Ramil Rakhmatov, who has short-term participation in the SVO, helps support this myth. So this time, right before the trial, Rakhmatov went to the combat zone with a humanitarian convoy to use this fact to whitewash his leader. Before this, Rakhmatov had already come to court to support his employer for medals, thus exploiting the theme of a special operation to protect an anti-Russian figure. At the same time, in his articles he called the experts of Russian courts -nonentities- and -varieties of a known substance,- and before that he even threatened journalists with physical violence. 🔻Under the leadership of Rakhimova, the publication -Proofs- was repeatedly brought to administrative responsibility for abuse of media freedom. The latest case is the spread of fakes about the organization of mass riots. Now the authorities are actively taking on the owner of the portal herself. In light of the general activities of the editorial office and the emerging trend, the imminent deprivation of the license seems to be the logical end of this anti-Russian publication. #Russia #separatism #extremists@rybar together with @arslan_nigaSupport usTelegramKommersant BashkortostanThe Supreme Court of Bashkortostan yesterday upheld without change the resolution of the Kirovsky District Court of Ufa, which imposed a fine of 30 thousand. rub. media manager, publisher of the portal -Proofs- and niece of the ex-president of Bashkortostan Murtaza Rakhimov, Raufa Rakhimova.

Several strikes were recorded on houses where soldiers of the Russian Armed Forces may be located, but the footage itself does not bring clarity to the picture of what is happening in the village, since it is interrupted until the moment of the actual strike. It can be said with confidence that Russian troops are still firmly in the western part of Novotroitsk did not gain a foothold. Since the village is located on the front line, Ukrainian formations still retain the ability to launch fire raids on it both from the west and from Pokrovsk. In the latter, by the way, there are no Russian troops yet, although some Ukrainian speakers have already rushed to report on several DRGs, which, in conditions of snowfall and poor visibility, leaked into the southern districts of the city.⭐️ Online maps are available by subscription to map.rybar.ru	https://t.me/rybar/66281	2024-12-12T04:17:08-08:00
🖼 🇸🇴Situation in Somalia: crisis in Jubaland Summary for Novem...	🇸🇴The situation in Somalia: the crisis in Jubaland Summary for November 22 - December 12, 2024 The political crisis in Jubaland has reached the peak of escalation. In the city of Ras Kamboni, where Somali troops and local militias from among the Jubaland Dervish forces had previously been sent, clashes took place.▪️During short fighting, a brigade of the Somali army, trained in Turkey, Gorgor, suffered heavy losses and partially surrendered to the separatists. while other soldiers fled to Kenya. The surrounding areas of the city also came under the control of local forces. After a break with the federal authorities, the Jubaland authorities abandoned dialogue and proceeded to escalate the conflict. It’s interesting that they took their elite abroad in advance. Thus, the Minister of National Security of Jubaland was taken out of the country under the escort of Ethiopian troops.🔻And all this is happening against the backdrop of negotiations on reconciliation between Somalia and Ethiopia, held in Ankara. According to the final communique, both sides agreed on mutually beneficial commercial agreements and sustainable access to the sea. ❗️But this does not mean that the Ethiopian authorities will stop secretly supporting separatists in Somaliland and, now, in Jubaland. Due to the rapprochement of the leadership in Mogadishu with the Egyptians, who are the Ethiopians’ rivals in the struggle for regional influence, other provocations should be expected. Moreover, the true intentions of the Ethiopians were emphasized by the visit of the head of the administration of the Ethiopian national district of Somalia to Hargeisa to meet with the President of Somaliland.▪️In addition to the events in Jubaland, the situation in the fight against terrorism also remains stable and tense. Some al-Shabab attacks take place near the capital. At this time, in autonomous Puntland, the armed forces are preparing an offensive against the Islamic State militants hiding in the rugged mountains. The latter, with the help of Western media, have managed to turn into almost the main base of the international terrorist group. We will find out what they really are in the near future.

🇦🇲🇫🇷🇺🇸 About the military cooperation of Armenia with Franc...	🇦🇲🇫🇷🇺🇸 About the military cooperation of Armenia with France and the USA Representatives of the military departments of Armenia and France signed a defense cooperation program for 2025 in Yerevan. The parties noted the strategic importance of the relations between the two countries, which include military planning, education and exercises. The Armenian Ministry of Defense did not provide more detailed details of the agreement. Recently, a meeting between Armenian and US Defense Ministers Suren Papikyan and Lloyd Austin also took place in Washington. A short summary from the Pentagon noted that such a meeting took place for the first time in 20 years, and the parties confirmed the strategic partnership of the two countries in achieving lasting peace in the South Caucasus. Both news feeds predictably caused a storm of emotions in the Armenian information field, but it is significant that, at least publicly, neither the French nor the American sides promised anything fundamentally new for Armenia in the field of security. Perhaps we can note the promises of the Americans to develop a new military uniform for the Armenians. 🔻Apparently, it is important for the outgoing administration of President Joe Biden to outline American priorities in Armenia. Moreover, as we wrote, it is still unclear what role the South Caucasus will play in Donald Trump’s policies. However, the State Department adviser is already working hard in the Armenian Ministry of Defense, and they promise to reform the Armenian army to NATO standards. For the government of Nikol Pashinyan, both events are important in domestic political terms, creating the appearance of building a new security system for Armenia, and even more so after Yerevan’s regular claims against the CSTO. However, as current practice shows, relying solely on external assistance in regional contradictions does not necessarily protect against complete collapse. #Armenia #USA #France @rybarSupport us. 2025 November 10-ին ՀՀ News News News The նախարարության…	https://t.me/rybar/66279	2024-12-12T02:44:01-08:00

The other day, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said that IS militants could take advantage of the collapse of the Syrian government and restore their combat effectiveness in the Middle East. But the head of the Pentagon is disingenuous : The group is already gradually increasing its activity. Even during the offensive of the pro-Turkish conglomerate, IS terrorists resumed attacks in the Syrian desert. A few days ago, the Americans, as they say, carried out an operation against them, hitting about 75 targets, but did not provide any facts, so we cannot take the press release of the joint central command at its word worth it.❗️A huge role in the possible restoration of the combat potential of the Islamic State was played by the terrorists themselves from the Idlib reserve, who freed everyone along the way prisoners from all prisons, including notorious ISIS thugs. Does anyone seriously think that the extremists have reformed while in prison? They became even angrier - much more likely. And the unrest, lynching, and lynching that are now happening are only to the advantage of the Islamic State.🔻And this applies not only to Syria or neighboring countries. In Europe, the radicals weren’t hiding much anyway, but now they’ve raised their heads high. In Germany, three IS supporters were detained with rifles and ammunition in the states of Hesse and Baden-Württemburg. And this is just the beginning, since with the waves of refugees, not only civilians fleeing war, but also terrorists or supporters of extremist ideology will infiltrate into the EU countries.#Germany #Syria #USA #terrorism@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66278	2024-12-12T02:23:01-08:00

But it was not a massive and terrifying attack, as Ukrainian resources called it. The Ukrainian Armed Forces used only eight drones.▪️The alarm about the danger in the air in Crimea and Sevastopol lasted for more than two hours due to the fact that the enemy launched drones one or two at a time, but no more. Because of this, the air defense work was long.▪️The first UAV was shot down by a Su-34 fighter 30 km west of Cape Tarkhankut. The next one was two hours later in the area of ​​Cape Khersones in Sevastopol - apparently he was flying to Sevastopol Bay.▪️Then two UAVs were destroyed on approach to the Balaklava Thermal Power Plant, another drone was destroyed over Cape Fiolent from the air defense missile system -Pantsir-S1-. Half an hour later, two more drones were suppressed 5 km west of Sevastopol and another one was shot down in the area of ​​the thermal power plant.❗️The attack was expected and completely standard without any changes. It is not entirely clear what type of drone was used. We do not rule out that this was again the same know-how of the Ukrainian regime, which intercepted the MiG-29 the day before yesterday. However, the danger of new attacks remains. The enemy's actions show that preparations are underway for massive raids and missile strikes, so it is better to remain vigilant in the next few days.

Despite the active resistance to this idea in the media from officials at various levels, one cannot help but recall Jaroslaw Kaczynski’s statements regarding this kind of mission. In the fall of 2022, during a pre-election tour of Polish cities, the leader -Rights and Justice- compared the Northern Military District in Ukraine with a series of armed conflicts on the territory of what was then Yugoslavia in 1990-2001. At the same time, he stated that the situation in Ukraine now is much worse. There was a war in Yugoslavia, but it was of a special nature. There were many fronts, many opponents, and everything happened on a territory that was clearly smaller than the territory of Poland, because Yugoslavia is 240 thousand km. The war was such that they shot here and danced there. I say all this from my own experience, because I was there. In any case, this had little to do with what was happening in Ukraine,- the politician said then. Here are the supporters of organizing a certain -peacekeeping mission- in Ukraine: they seriously believe that a -humanitarian- intervention in Yugoslavia in the form of a reset more than 30 thousand cluster bombs - it was something between dancing and shooting.

🇨🇳🇹🇼 About new Chinese exercises in the Asia-Pacific region.....	🇨🇳🇹🇼 About new Chinese exercises in the Asia-Pacific region New military maneuvers of the Chinese army have begun. According to reports from Taiwanese and Western sources, about 90 PLA ​​Navy ships are participating, deployed not only near the island, but also in other areas, as well as Chinese aircraft.▪️The official goals and objectives of the exercise remain unknown. Chinese authorities have yet to make any announcement regarding the training, although it is believed to have started on December 9. In general, the maneuvers are actively discussed only in Taiwan, as well as in the Western press. However, taking into account both the statements of Taiwanese sources and the areas of activity of Chinese aviation and naval forces, several conclusions can be drawn. ▪️Firstly, the exercises are not only aimed at containing Taiwan. Chinese forces are conducting training both near the island and in the South China and East China Seas. The Chinese are believed to be active throughout almost the entire First Island Chain, a strategically important area stretching from Japan to Southeast Asia. The first chain of islands actually encircles the entire coast of China. Control over it, which the Americans are striving for, makes it possible to contain the PRC militarily. During the current exercises, the Chinese are working on measures to limit access to it from the inside. Therefore, Chinese technology was observed both near the Philippines and near the Japanese islands. ▪️Secondly, the main purpose of the exercises is most likely not to punish Taiwanese politicians. Yes, the leader of the island, Lai Qingde, last week visited American territories in the Pacific Ocean in transit, which the Chinese authorities did not really like. However, comparing the areas of previous exercises, which began after the actions of the Taiwanese and surrounded only the island, with the current ones, it becomes clear that the matter lies not only in the activities of the local administration. 🔻Perhaps such large-scale exercises are intended to send a signal to the future American administration and the elected US President Donald Trump. This is necessary to show China's influence on the first island chain and prove China's willingness to take control of it. Let us emphasize that the Chinese authorities have not yet made any substantive comments on the ongoing exercises. Therefore, the situation may become clearer after they are completed.

Probably, the enemy was also knocked out of the forest to the south near the railway, since without control over him an attack towards the village would have been impossible.▪️With the liberation of Novy Trud, the Russian Armed Forces provide a bridgehead for encircling enemy positions in Zeleny and Dachenskoye from the west, simultaneously with thereby attacking from the east from Lysovka. In the future, this will make it possible to eliminate the pocket along the section of the M-30 highway between Dachensky and Novy Trud.▪️ At the same time, the enemy made an unsuccessful attack attempt in the village of Shevchenko. Two armored vehicles of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and a tank were blown up at minefields on the northern outskirts of the village by the Russian Armed Forces. Exactly how they were installed - from the air or by sappers manually - is not yet known. It is possible that at the moment the village has already been taken under control by Russian troops.▪️To the west, fighting continues in Novotroitsky, on the eastern outskirts of which Ukrainian formations are trying from time to time to organize fire raids under the cover of armored vehicles.

Ukraine within the framework of a possible agreement between the United States and the Russian Federation. Details of the plan are not disclosed, but it is known that it is based on the Korean scenario. According to it, a foreign contingent of peacekeeping forces is introduced to the demarcation line. Macron's idea received tacit approval from the UK in November. Poland's participation in this strategy is presented as decisive due to its military potential and geographical location. And it is clear why the French President expects special support from the Poles: after all, in this way they would be able to legally approach Vskhodny Kresy. It is interesting that there has already been a reaction to Macron’s plan in Warsaw: the head of the Polish Ministry of Defense, Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysh, said that the sending of Polish soldier on&nbsp;so-called Ukraine is out of the question, since the key role here should be played by NATO, and not by individual countries. At the same time, after a long time, the Poles again started talking about legalizing their mercenaries who are fighting for the Armed Forces of Ukraine illegally - Officially this should be punishable by up to five years in prison. The details of the initiative are unknown, but they say that the bill provides for forgiveness and oblivion of crimes and misdemeanors from February 24, 2022 to December 31, 2026 for joining the Armed Forces of Ukraine without the consent of the competent authority of Poland. That is, in addition to the fact that the Poles will be allowed to fight unhindered in .n. Ukraine will also be allowed, in fact, to do it as it pleases - no criminal prosecution is provided for. In this situation, it will be possible not to take the Poles prisoner. However, it is worth understanding that in reality we are not talking about a peacekeeping mission as such - that is, the deployment of blue helmets, which will essentially perform police functions in no man's land: for Neither people nor special equipment will be enough for this. 🔻The conversation concerns the introduction of a limited contingent of NATO troops, who could thus simply take over Ukrainian territory. And this, in turn, means a truly serious military escalation with the Russian Federation. As a result, the parties will probably not reach any solution: none of the European governments is ready to take on such responsibility and thereby face the threat of a nuclear strike. But for now, you can distract yourself from internal political crises, economic collapse and social tension, and pretend to be hegemons, pretending that the fate of the entire Western world depends on the participation of France or Poland.#Poland #France #Ukraine@rybar together with @pl_syrenkaSupport usTelegramVarshavskaya mermaid🇵🇱🇫🇷🇺🇦 Poland is expecting a visit from French President Emmanuel Macron.

In one recording, he can be heard giving instructions on an action plan to divide into mobile groups, which should move out in the coming days in the vicinity of Rustaveli Avenue in Tbilisi. ❗️The Georgian State Security Service reported preparations for provocations on the day of the presidential elections on December 14: the opposition plans to cause unrest through the first victim and blood. The world community has observed a similar scenario more than once, and it worked especially effectively during the Kyiv Maidan. When the protest began to decline, it took the organization of violence and the first victims, which took the protest to a new level. So in Georgia the protest has begun to decline, so now the opposition can only hold on with the help of violence. #Georgia@pezdicide no chemicals - just factsTelegram🇬🇪 📢 SULinfo - სულინფო⚡⚡ინტერნეტში ვრცელდება ჩანაწერი, თუ როგორ გეგმავს ძალადობრივი აქციების ორგანიზატორთა მიერ შექმნილი ე.წ.

🇬🇧🇷🇺🌓 And again about the British influence on the migration...	🇬🇧🇷🇺🌓 And again about British influence on the migration situation in Russia. In recent days, the topic of the migration situation in Russia, the possible consequences and the destructive influence of Western intelligence services (primarily the UK) on what is happening has been raised in the highest political circles.➖Today, the director of the FSB Alexander Bortnikov, who stated that the activities of Western intelligence services are aimed at creating artificial hotbeds of tension through ethno-confessional specifics.❗️This is a serious fact, since the head of such a structure as the FSB personally drew attention to this problem.➖Before this, State Duma deputy Andrei Lugovoi spoke about the same, who noted the urgent need for a legislative settlement of migration issues and preventing hostile activities of foreign agents in this direction. The role of Western intelligence services and the organizations they feed on the territory of Russia is extremely high, if not called key at all. It was the discovery of these facts that became the reason for their expulsion in September of this year, and then again in November. The program to undermine the internal political situation in Russia was born back in the 90s, but only at the beginning of this century did intensive work begin on the implementation of a multi-year project aimed at the destruction of Russia from the inside.🔻And the actions of Great Britain in this direction are easy to determine if you can look into the details. Recently, the British MI5 and MI6 were prohibited from accepting -white citizens- for internships. Minorities fell into new categories (blacks, Asians, Arabs, and so on). It would seem, why would the British infringe on the rights of the indigenous population? But under the guise of working on the Western agenda, the British made a significant feint to create personnel intelligence officers for foreign intelligence, including from representatives of the nations of Central Asia. The British have made similar steps throughout their history. During the Great Game in Afghanistan, foreign intelligence schools functioned in India, where recruitment was carried out from among the population inhabiting the region, with subsequent transfer to the zone of Russian influence. A very similar scheme, isn’t it? Only instead of professional intelligence officers, thousands of migrants from Central Asia arrive in Russia, more than half of whom have a vague history. For what purpose is this being done - you can see the answer in the migration situation in Russia.#Great Britain #multinationalism #Russia@rybarSupport usThe TelegraphWhite British students not allowed to apply for security services internshipDecision described as 'blatant discrimination' and 'racist' as MI5, MI6 and GCHQ try to increase diversity among their ranks	https://t.me/rybar/66248	2024-12-11T07:54:02-08:00

Conducting joint exercises with other partners in the region was also discussed. ▪️In general, nothing new was said by representatives of the USA, Japan and the Philippines. Important agreements and even hints of them were also absent. This is largely explained by the format of the meeting - the level of representatives was quite low, and the dialogue itself is more of a platform for discussing problems, rather than something more significant. ▪️However, despite the lackluster nature of the event, its holding is another sign of growing close ties between the Philippines, the USA and Japan. Of course, there is no talk of a conventional analogue of a military alliance in the region yet, but the formalization of cooperation between the three countries is happening right now. 📌By the way, it’s funny that the incident with the use of lasers by the Chinese was revealed the day before the meeting. It originally happened last week, but the video appeared only recently. Of course, it is impossible to prove a direct connection between these events. However, it is difficult to deny the fact that before such negotiations in the South China Sea, similar incidents or exercises occur, only heating up the situation. #USA #Philippines #Japan@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usINQUIRER.NETPH-US-Japan maritime talks flag 'unlawful' Chinese behavior in West PH SeaMANILA, Philippines – The Philippines, United States and Japan raised -serious concerns- over China's repeated blocking and harassment of Philippine vessels in the West Philippine Sea during their inaugural trilateral maritime talks in Japan.	https://t.me/rybar/66247	2024-12-11T07:33:01-08:00

In the province of Deir ez-Zor, fighting continues between the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and associations led by - Hayat Tahrir al-Sham- (HTS) and -Syrian National Army- (SNA).▪️Pro-HTS militants -Department of Military Operations - completely took control of the city of Deir ez-Zor and the military airport located there. The Kurds did not offer resistance and went to the opposite bank of the Euphrates. ▪️In the Kurdish media, the retreat from previously taken (actually handed over by the SAR armed forces who fled from there) territories was explained by some agreements with the terrorists - Hayat Tahrir al-Sham - concluded through the mediation of the Americans. The condition was the non-entry of pro-Turkish SNA factions into the populated area, in particular such as -Tajamua Ahrar al-Sharqiya-, whose members maternity hospital from these lands. However, soon footage appeared in which they, contrary to promises, show off in Deir ez-Zor.❗The statements about the agreements between HTS and the SDF look remarkable. It is worth noting that reports of ties between the two sides, bypassing Turkish warnings, began to appear long before the fall of the government of Bashar al-Assad. And then the commander-in-chief of the SDF, Mazlum Abdi, officially declares the readiness of the pro-Kurdish administration to cooperate with the new authorities in Damascus, confirming the existence of contacts through the same United States and at the same time criticizing Assad.▪️Amid the ongoing clashes, information appeared about a split in the ranks of the Military Council of Deir ez-Zor - - an American-backed Arab formation within the Syrian Democratic Forces responsible for this province. Some of the fighters, led by commander Abu al-Harith al-Shaaiti, deserted and joined the -legitimate opposition- and -progressive jihadists-, while some remained loyal to the leadership of the SDS. At the same time, the scale of the split is unknown. However, the most interesting thing is just beginning: in order to put the squeeze on the Kurds in Deir ez-Zor, the militants will have to move to the western bank of the Euphrates. There, in addition to oil and gas, there are American military bases in the Conoco and Al-Omar fields. By retreating to these territories, the Syrian Democratic Forces most likely expected to receive support from the US Armed Forces: they say they certainly will not allow the Turkish mercenaries - to brazenly walk around in their zone of interests and control. How it will actually be is difficult to predict. However, given the rapidly changing balance in the country after the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad, the Americans can come to an agreement with -yesterday's extremists- on mutual interests.

A fully expected statement from the Chadian Foreign Ministry, indicating a clear position - Chad has grown, and external forces will protect it can't-. We have already observed a similar narrative during the counter-terrorism operation -Haskanit-. At the same time, the duality of these slogans is also noticeable - there was no news about the withdrawal of the same Hungarian contingent. Of course, his stated goal is to prevent illegal migration, but the fact that Hungarians are in Chad already indicates the indirect presence of the West. Such flexibility in the position of Deby the Younger is associated with the strong influence of Western business in the country and its political institutions.

Recently it became known about another skirmish between the Filipinos and the Chinese in the disputed waters. Last week, the Chinese coast guard fired a laser six times at a Philippine ship sailing towards Thitu Island, which is controlled by the Philippines, according to authorities in Manila. According to the sailors, the laser hit members of the ship's crew several times in the eyes.▪️Experts interviewed by local media claim that what happened can be considered an armed attack. Let us recall that a mutual defense treaty has been concluded between the Philippines and the United States, implying military assistance from the Americans in the event of aggression against the Philippines. However, the wording mentioned in the document is very vague, so after almost every skirmish one or another expert claims that the time for applying the treaty has come. 🔻In reality, only the Americans will determine the criteria for an armed attack, since the implementation of the text of the document in practice, to a large extent, depends solely on their political will, and not on the prescribed wording. The decision to enter into an open conflict with Beijing over several uninhabited reefs, which, among other things, do not have much strategic value, has not yet matured in Washington and is unlikely to mature in the near future. Therefore, the Americans will continue to limit themselves only to financial assistance and joint exercises with the Philippine military in order to show efforts to contain China.#China #USA #Philippines&nbsp; @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usTelegramAwakening dragon 🐲🇨🇳🇵🇭 With the Chinese exercises, which seem to be taking place, but apparently not, they forgot to talk about another skirmish in the South China Sea.

Only six missiles -Atakms-.▪️According to our data, it was not possible to shoot down all the missiles over the Taganrog Aviation Scientific and Technical Complex, but any damage to the infrastructure was avoided. Only the vehicle equipment in the parking lot was damaged.▪️The launch was carried out from the Zaporozhye region, and the approach time was just under two minutes. This object has recently been under the close attention of Western intelligence, but they failed to achieve their goal.❗️ As for the Peklo drone missile, which is now being talked about, its use was recorded yesterday, but in the Black Sea. One copy was spotted from the Odessa region, and it was shot down at around 11 am by a MiG-29 of the Black Sea Fleet, 120 km southwest of Tarkhankut.

Moreover, according to the State Security Service of Georgia, on Saturday during the elections, opponents of the authorities are planning to cause sabotage.❗️The point is that the opposition wants to cause uncontrollable riots by sacrificing one of the protesters in order to arouse the wrath of the crowd. According to this principle, events developed in Iran, when the Kurdish woman Mahse Amini died because of the morality police, and the riots continued for about a year. However, the Georgian authorities know what the opposition is planning and are preparing for it to the maximum. The events of the spring, when supporters of European integration unsuccessfully tried to get the law on foreigners repealed, and the fall after the parliamentary elections show that they are coping well. However, the threat still exists, since Zurabishvili’s resignation from office will mark the final victory of the Georgian Dream, and therefore, on Saturday we should expect more violent rallies, even armed clashes. But in case of failure here too, the Georgian opposition will lose all its potential, and protest activity will decline.

John Dramani Mahama, who had already held this position from 2012 to 2017, was elected president.▪️The new government is faced with the task of coping with a protracted economic crisis: in recent years, many Western companies have left the country, despite the pro-American position of the ex-president. Therefore, the main activities in The new authorities' plans will likely include the fight against corruption and poor financial management. ▪️The election of John Dramani Mahama was positive news for the sovereign governments of the Alliance of Sahel States. Ghana's ports play a strategic role in ensuring Burkina Faso's trade links with other countries. Previously, the Ghanaian authorities, following the instructions of the Americans, considered plans to limit the use of Ghanaian ports for transportation to foreign countries, but now this threat has been eliminated. ❗️For domestic diplomacy and business representatives, this event also creates a window of opportunity. Mahama is a graduate of a Moscow university, and his party has many members friendly to Russia. This summer he even flew to Russia to present the Russian translation of his book. There is reason to believe that the new government will be able to overcome the crisis and return Ghana to its attractiveness for foreign investment.

Considering the importance Syria played for Iran, such discussions will continue for a long time. The logistics of the IRGC was built through Syria in cooperation with Lebanon and Hezbollah. Built during the war with IS, the Soleimani land corridor has long been the basis of the Iranian axis of resistance. And this does not take into account Iran’s huge subsidized investments in the government of Syria, which has sunk into oblivion.❗️Against this background, it is not surprising that Western resources report that there is a showdown in the highest Iranian circles over how such a mistake in support was made Syria, which led to disarray in the army and government. For the Iranian leadership, the loss of Syria is a serious blow that weakens the country’s capabilities in the confrontation with Israel - everything Pro-Iranian formations have been withdrawn from Syria. Now there are only militants, Israel and Turkey, and with them - chaos. And if personnel changes begin in Iran in the coming weeks, they will most likely be related to the Syrian events.

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇲🇩🇺🇸 About the USAID program in Moldova for the register of politically exposed persons In Moldova, they intend to create a platform for identifying politically exposed persons within the framework of the American USAID project. The US Agency for International Development is implementing a large-scale five-year project in Moldova - The Moldova Institutional and Structural Reforms Activity. ▪️As part of the project, a proposal was received to optimize the identification of politically exposed persons performing important government functions, as well as to identify risks associated with preventing and combating money laundering and terrorist financing in Moldova. ▪️Politically exposed persons are individuals who perform important government functions in relevant positions. Their family members and other related persons must also be included in the register. ▪️The main task of such a platform is to assess the risks that such persons may potentially bear in the field of money laundering and terrorist financing in their activities. ❗️It would seem that USAID is pursuing the seemingly noble goal of the platform - preventing the fight against illegal activities. However, the current authorities of Moldova can call any cooperation with Russia money laundering or even terrorism. It is obvious that the Americans do not just allocate money for such projects, the real task of which is to place agents of their influence in responsible positions in any sphere of the state. 📌This is especially indicative in the context of the current energy crisis in Moldova and the attempts of unsuccessful authorities to find scapegoats. For example, a scandal is now breaking out that some employees of Moldovagaz subsidiaries have pro-Russian views. What exactly this has to do with the performance of work duties is not very clear, when it is the country’s top leadership that sabotages negotiations with the Russian Federation on gas supplies, which aggravates the crisis in Moldova. 🔻In Moldova, USAID’s favorite strategy in the post-Soviet space is being implemented in full swing: through humanitarian initiatives, in reality, to put under control all strategic areas of the state. After all, the draft platform of politically exposed persons is designed to place their agents of influence and prevent those who may arouse suspicion of the desired political orientation from taking control. #Moldova #USA @pezdicide no chemistry - just factspoint.mdMoldova intends to create a platform for identifying politically exposed persons The USAID program - Institutional and structural reforms in Moldova - invited Moldovan companies in the IT and financial services sector to develop electronic solutions that would improve the identification of politically exposed persons persons in the country.	https://t.me/rybar/66237	2024-12-10T23:43:01-08:00

These love games between the Poles and the Ukrainian authorities are funny if you know that their relationship is still as strong militarily as before. Of course, there are no longer supplies of as many weapons and equipment as there were at the beginning of the Northern Military District. But nevertheless, the Poles supply the Ukrainian Armed Forces with drones, as well as parts for BECs (thanks to the Archangel personnel). ♦️But something else is much more important: everyone has had a question for many months - where are the F-16 fighters that Western countries handed over to the Ukrainians?-. And the answer, as you may have guessed, is simple - they are in Poland.❗️The Minsk-Mazowiecki air base east of Warsaw is now home to 16 F-16 fighters. Of these, 7 have already been repainted to match the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and they are flying to Ukraine to combat drones. Another 6 F-16As of the Dutch Air Force and 3 Danish F-16s, which flew over the other day. Thus, in Poland (but not in Ukraine) there are currently 16 units of Ukrainian F-16s, but only 7 are flying so far. After completing the tasks they return to Minsk Mazowiecki. The rest are still being prepared for operation.♦️This is an interesting situation related to the Poles and Ukrainians. But another important point is that 18 F-16A units of the Dutch Air Force are now fixed in Romania at the Fetesti airbase. Crew training for these fighters has been organized in Romania since last year. Previously there were 6 units, but recently the number has increased. So in total, the Ukrainian Armed Forces now have 34 F-16 fighters. This relates to the question of possible negotiations at the beginning of 2025.

Western intelligence services are actively helping this, including satellite ones, which share location data with Ukraine our air defense systems, the situation at airfields and other facilities of the RF Armed Forces. Over the past 24 hours, 17 sessions of satellite work in this direction were recorded, of which 11 were in the territory of the Kursk region. Several more sessions were noted in the Belgorod, Voronezh and Bryansk regions. In the classical manner, the enemy pays attention to the airfields of the Russian Aerospace Forces, such as in Kursk and Voronezh, air defense positions, as well as artillery bases as potential targets for attack.

The basis for this was the announced figures of foreign funding for -decolonization- projects in the CIS countries and the subsequent growth of anti-Russian sentiment. As a result, a lot of people with radical and Russophobic views end up in Russia, since there is no input filtering in this regard. The new project, apparently, is designed to eliminate this order of things. There is nothing fundamentally impossible in the technical implementation - a similar system has been introduced in Sheremetyevo for those coming from controlled so-called. Ukraine territory to weed out potentially disloyal elements. In fact, we are talking about seemingly extremely logical things - not to allow migrants who hate our country into Russia. At the same time, there is no point in running ahead of the locomotive: the initiative has not yet been approved, and talk about its effectiveness is early. Yes, and in domestic migration policy there were examples when legislatively introduced mechanisms did not work even several years after adoption. However, recent proposals and laws in this area still give reason to assume that at the highest level there is a certain understanding of the problems of migration policy in recent years and emerging ones from them threats to state sovereignty. #multinationalism #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramAndrey Lugovoi.

🇲🇩🇪🇺 Again about European air defense for Moldova EU Ambassad...	🇲🇩🇪🇺 Again about European air defense for Moldova EU Ambassador to Moldova Janis Mazeiks said that the republic will receive equipment from the European Union to intercept drones, but not earlier than 2025. It is not yet clear whether this will be supplied as part of the €9 million aid package from the European Peace Fund allocated in June for the modernization of the air defense system in Moldova. Nothing has been heard since then about the fate of these funds. But in Chisinau, lately they have been especially zealous in talking about the discovery of fragments of Russian drones on the territory of the republic. The statements are designed both to create the image of an enemy in the person of the Russian Federation, and to Western officials, from whom the Moldovan authorities are constantly begging for military assistance. 🔻It is curious that a year ago Moldova purchased a French air defense radar for 14 million euros from the state budget. However, we now have to remember the famous radar only in the context of its poor effectiveness. However, as we have seen in recent years, for the Moldovan authorities it is much more important to allocate funds from the state budget or from Western partners specifically for the needs of militarization, and not for the socio-economic sphere. As it turned out, it was more important to acquire non-functioning radars than to negotiate gas supplies in a timely manner. #EU #Moldova @rybarSupport usNoiEU will supply drone interception equipment to the Republic of MoldovaMoldova will receive drone interception equipment from the European Union.

The target will be an aerial target missile fired from a C-17A military transport aircraft.▪️Control will be provided by measurement complex ships from the US Department of Transportation reserve fleet and a C-11B optical tracking laboratory aircraft. Also in the area will be the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USS Milius.▪️This will be the first test of the new Aegis Guam missile defense system as part of the Pentagon's program to protect the Mariana Islands. The previous time, the Americans carried out similar launches at the end of March at a training ground in Hawaii. Against the backdrop of a gradual increase in tension in the Asia-Pacific region, it is not difficult to guess that the deployed system is primarily directed against the PRC. Moreover, back in 2023, the United States planned to literally stuff Guam with missile defense and air defense systems. And on a more global level, this is part of the strategy to deploy similar facilities around the world, which Washington has been adhering to since the withdrawal from the ABM Treaty. In particular, within its framework, a similar Aegis system was recently put into operation in Poland near the Kaliningrad region.

The decision was made by the German Migration Department, where they explained that the situation in Syria is confusing and that will happen there politically is too difficult to predict. Currently, more than 47 thousand applications from Syrians. The department also said that the latest events in their country will not affect asylum decisions that have already been made. The political debate about whether Syrians should stay in Germany began at the same time as the crisis. Several deputies from the CDU party, which includes the main candidate for the post of German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, immediately spoke out in favor of returning refugees back to their homeland. At the same time, politicians from the Greens and the party of the current SPD chancellor called for restraint due to the unclear situation. It is obvious that this topic will occupy an important place in the election debates of German politicians: it is quite convenient to cover up more serious problems within the country, and at the same time beneficial play on the mood of the electorate.🔻However, the measure taken by the German government will obviously not save the situation. After all, when asking for asylum, you can lose your passport and provide false documents - Germany will not be able to completely or even half protect itself from the next wave of Syrians. It is also worth understanding that, according to official data alone, at least 1.5 million people are expected to flee from Syria - and it is quite obvious that most of them will try to break through to Europe. Namely, in Germany, a large diaspora of Syrians has settled quite firmly and long ago - this is the largest group in the country after the Ukrainians, only officially there are about 900 thousand of them in the country. Therefore, it is logical that many of the fugitives will want to join their brothers, and they will be happy to help them .#Germany #Syria #migrants @rybar together with @pl_syrenkaSupport usSpiegelAlle Verfahren ausgesetzt – Bamf stoppt Entscheidung über Asylanträge von SyrernDas Bundesamt für Migration und Flüchtlinge bearbeitet bis auf Weiteres keine Asylanträge von Syrerinnen und Syrern.

The targets were objects in several provinces at once, including those controlled by the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in the northeast of the country, which had not happened before.▪️The hits were on military research centers in the vicinity of the Syrian capital Damascus and the suburbs of Qudsaya . Fires broke out, which were soon extinguished by local services.▪️Marine infrastructure and equipment in the port of Latakia were attacked. According to Israeli media, ships of unknown destination on the roadstead also came under attack, but this information has not yet been confirmed.▪️ Explosions occurred at the Al-Shayrat airbase in Homs province, which the Israelis have repeatedly struck. Apparently, there the IDF tried to destroy the remnants of the Syrian Air Force, air defense systems and infrastructure.▪️In territories controlled by Kurdish forces in the provinces of Ar-Raqqa and Al-Hasakah, the Israelis hit facilities previously used by the troops of the overthrown government of Bashar al-Assad.🔻As we wrote, on At the moment, the Israelis will do everything possible to ensure that the weapons and ammunition of the SAA, which has sunk into oblivion, do not fall into into the hands of the militants to the new authorities formed by the -legal opposition-. This can explain the attacks in the zone of control of the SDF, which for the time being coexisted with the enclaves of the Syrian Armed Forces: there is a considerable probability that the hand of the Syrian revolution in the person of the pro-Turkish Syrian National Army (SNA) will reach there too. The Israeli Air Force will continue to attack military warehouses, air defense elements, airfields and research centers in order to completely deprive the militants of the legacy of the SAA, which could threaten Israel or be resold to third parties. At the same time, the matter will not be limited to strikes alone, and after their completion, the IDF units that entered El Quneitra will not be in a hurry to leave. After all, if previously this kind of activity was justified by the presence of Iranian-backed forces in the region, now progressive jihadists will act as a punching bag.

Ukraine as a state entity. In our opinion, the best answer to the question is two recent news: ▪️The Commissioner of the Kiev... 🇺🇸🇺🇦 The American administration continues to insist on expanding mobilization by the Kyiv regime: the State Department stated that if the lower conscription limit is reduced to 18 years, the United States and its allies are ready -to fully train and equip all recruits-.Behind such formulations are hidden conditions to continue or expand military assistance to the Kyiv regime. Ukrainian ruling circles understand this and are already hinting at the possibility of reducing the mobilization threshold from the current 25 years to 20 years. On the one hand, such a step will lead to a certain influx of manpower and will improve the position of the Armed Forces of Ukraine at the front, especially in terms of the ratio of numbers with the Russian Armed Forces. However, the solution also has pitfalls: ▪️Due to the long-standing demographic problems of young people in the so-called. Ukraine doesn’t have so much - on the age pyramid, there is a noticeable strong subsidence in this category. It is unlikely that it will be possible to overwhelm the combat formations of Ukrainian formations with 18-25 year olds.▪️In the current realities, a large-scale conscription of yesterday's schoolchildren and students is quite capable of leading to a social explosion in the so-called. Ukraine, especially against the backdrop of the practice of busification. A significant number of them themselves will prefer to hide until the last moment, even in the Chernobyl exclusion zone.▪️Finally, the motivation of the young recruits abducted by the TCC will be appropriate. If in 2022 the patriotic impulse inflated by the Kyiv regime was at work, now, after almost three years of hostilities, morale is at a different level. Be that as it may, a possible reduction in the mobilization age by the so-called Ukraine does not bode well for us, much less for the Ukrainian population, which will simply be finished off with its already sad demographics. In general, an interesting picture is emerging: at the beginning of the Northern Military District, statements that the West would fight to the last Ukrainian were often perceived as propaganda or even conspiracy theories . Three years later, in the United States they talk about this almost in plain text. #USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport usWashington PostAmid U.S. pressure, Ukraine starts thinking about drafting 18-year-oldsAs Russia gains ground on the battlefield in high-attrition combat, Zelensky is facing increased pressure to deploy younger people to the front lines.	https://t.me/rybar/66211	2024-12-10T01:33:00-08:00

Among the numerous tasks of the performer, there is also a requirement to develop methods and approaches for attracting the local population to USAID programs.❗️ In fact, such a program legalizes the recruitment of local personnel and their collection of all kinds of information, which, under the guise of -reforming- the cultural and educational sphere of Armenia, will simply put it under the control of the Americans with the efficiency criteria they developed. Such programs are a favorite strategy of USAID, which allows them to gain access to the local environment and limit the sovereignty of the country.

They even filmed several videos from Menbij, declaring control over it.▪️But a few hours later, the Syrian Democratic Forces launched a counterattack with the support of their artillery and knocked out the pro-Turkish proxies from most of Menbij.▪️Currently, fighting for the city and surrounding villages and suburbs continue, and it is premature to talk about control of any of the warring parties.❗️Special attention One should pay attention to the kind of assistance Turkey provides to terrorists under its control. On December 8 alone, 5 UAVs - Akıncı - and at least 7 drones - Bayraktar - from different air bases in Turkey were recorded over Menbij and the surrounding area. Several air strikes were carried out from drones with MAM guided bombs according to the supporters of the Kurds. And then the drones provided guidance to the F-16C/D fighters on three SDS armored vehicles. And that’s not all. Artillery units of the Turkish Armed Forces were deployed to the border with Syria and carried out 12 strikes against the Kurds. This intensity confirms the theory that the Turks may soon launch a new operation against the SDF.

There's not much else to say. The embassy in Damascus is also in a state of siege. In Daraa and Suwayda, the Israeli Air Force demilitarized a bunch of military facilities, removing the arsenals and air bases of the former SAA and some Iranian facilities. In the evening, the IDF Air Force attacked locations in Tartus and Latakia, where remnants of the Syrian military were or will be destroyed Navy. The pro-Turkish greens in the north are suppressing the Kurds, the status of Menbij is still unclear. The fighters say that they have recaptured, and the Kurds say that fighting is going on. In the area of ​​the Tishrin dam, two Kurdish women from the local militia were captured. Their fate is obviously unenviable. In the north, the activity of Turkish UAVs is growing, and the Kurds, out of fear, managed to shoot down the MQ-9. However, they are far from being the same as the Katozhuis in this matter. In Deir ez-Zor, local tribes are being hurricaned. They don’t really want to join the Kurds, and they swore allegiance to the greens very formally. The greens themselves, by the way, have not yet reached Deir ez-Zor, but by tomorrow they will probably be in the vicinity of the city. So far, everything is going to the point that the Kurds will be left alone with the coalition of greens, better known as lettuce. What adds zest to the salad is that there are American bases on Kurdish territory, but there is also an American base on the green territory in At-Tanf.⭐️ Online maps are available by subscription to map.rybar.ru	https://t.me/rybar/66200	2024-12-09T11:56:01-08:00

Forwarded From Two Majors🇪🇺🇸🇾Syrian consequences for Europe After the final fall of Bashar al-Assad’s power, European politicians rushed to praise the rebels, calling it democratic change. At the same time, thousands of uncoordinated rallies of Syrian diasporas took place in major European cities. Some of the most numerous actions took place in 🇩🇪Germany, where more than 25 thousand participants took part in demonstrations in various cities. Germany accepted about 1 million Syrian refugees, tens of thousands more settled in France, Greece, the Netherlands, Austria and other EU countries. However, by today, euphoria has given way to pragmatism. As we reported, the EU began to massively introduce restrictions on the admission of refugees from Syria. Currently, such measures have been introduced by 🇩🇪Germany, 🇫🇷France,🇦🇹 Austria, 🇳🇴Norway, 🇩🇰Denmark, 🇫🇮Finland and 🇸🇪Sweden.✨So far, Europe's response to -democratic changes- has been limited offers to Syrians to return to their homeland (in Germany they offered to give a thousand euros when deciding to return a refugee) and suspension of registration of new applications from refugees from Syria. In the future, they will put pressure on the delayed guests by cutting benefits and expelling refugees who have settled in comfort to a new democratic country. And then the fun begins.

🖼 🇸🇾 About the supposed new government of Syria, Arabic-langua...	🇸🇾 About the supposed new government of Syria Arabic-language media published the expected composition of the Syrian government, which should be formed by the opposition within 18 months. Until then, power in the country will be exercised by transitional authorities: in the process, a new constitution must be written. A place in the cabinet went to everyone: from the leader of the terrorist organization Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) Abu Muhammad al-Julani, to members of the National Coalition Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces (SRFOS) and independent activists and politicians like Ahmad Moaz al-Khatib. The new cabinet allegedly included the following persons: ▪️Riyad Hijab - former Prime Minister of Syria. In 2012, he was dismissed, after which he defected to the Free Syrian Army (FSA) and settled in Qatar, from where he called on officials and officers of the Syrian Armed Forces to desert. Until 2017, he was the head of the opposition High Negotiating Committee.▪️Abu Muhammad al-Julani is the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which led the Damascus march. At one time he was the leader of Jabhat al-Nusra, the Syrian branch of the terrorist organizations ISIS and Al-Qaeda. Now in the West he is known as the progressive jihadist Ahmad al-Sharaa.▪️Hadi al-Bahra is the head of the NKSROS, supported first by Western countries and then by Turkey. She, in turn, heads the pro-Turkish Provisional Government of Syria (TPG), located in the territories controlled by the Syrian National Army (SNA) in the north of Aleppo province.▪️Faisal al-Qasim is from the province of Es-Suwayda in southern Syria, Druze by nationality. TV presenter of a separate show on Al Jazeera. Apparently, his belonging to a religious minority and this kind of specialization opened his way to the Syrian Ministry of Information. It is noteworthy that most of the possible ministers are members of the NKSROS, which is not very popular in the Syrian opposition environment. Which is not surprising - most of the time they are located and meet outside Syria, in particular in Turkey and Qatar. It cannot be said that the Syrian Salvation Government (PSS) formed by the terrorists - Hayat Tahrir al-Sham Idlib - is popular. However, unlike its colleagues, it was able to form quite strong state institutions and even subordinate the formations of the former FSA. However, the West may be quite happy with this situation: members of the NKSROS are persons who have not stained their hands with blood, sort of secular democrats -, representatives of precisely the moderate part of the Syrian opposition. It also follows that HTS received only one seat in the cabinet, where Ahmad al-Sharaa took the post of Minister of Defense. How strong such a government will be is another question. Superimposed on it is the huge abundance of motley factions - the Syrian revolution -, a considerable part of which views democracy as disbelief, the opposite of what they fought for.

Forwarded From NERYBAR In the Pokrovsky direction, objective control footage appeared, confirming the presence of Russian troops in Novotroitsky. At the same time, it remains unclear from which side exactly the fighters entered the territory of the livestock complex on the southern outskirts of the village. The movement could pass through the Sazonovka gully (which will mark a big paint job if confirmed), but this route is much more distant and extends through open area. The most logical option seems to be an approach from the recently liberated Novopustynka to the eastern outskirts of Novotroitsky, from where they have already managed to get through to the farms. It is not yet known whether any units of Ukrainian forces remain in the latter. However, given the approach of the front to Pokrovsk from the south, they could be transferred to Shevchenko to the north, whose fall opens the way for Russian troops to advance directly to the southern suburbs of the Pokrovsk agglomeration.⭐️ Online maps are available by subscription to map.rybar.ru	https://t.me/rybar/66195	2024-12-09T07:52:09-08:00

The battle for Dzerzhinsk, a key defense center of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Aleksandro-Kalinovskoe direction, is gaining momentum. Over the past few weeks, Russian troops have pushed the Ukrainian Armed Forces out of several large strongholds in the city, and have also started fighting for waste heaps to the west. ▪️In the Dyleevka-Dachnoe section, Russian troops are concentrated on weakening the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Artillery and UAV crews are working at enemy firing points and temporary deployment points, gradually dismantling large defense lines. ▪️In the northern part of Dzerzhinsk, by December 1, attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces took control of the territory of the Shcherbinovka substation - 110/35/6 kV. Their presence was also recorded to the north of the substation, which indicates a complete clearing of the facility and the consolidation of Russian troops at the achieved lines. Ukrainian formations maintain a presence at the Avangard stadium to the west, which allows them to keep the territory of the city park under fire control. ▪️In the central sector, the Russian Armed Forces made significant progress along Mayakovsky and Frunze streets, knocking out the enemy from several strongholds. In many ways, this became possible thanks to the successful actions of assault groups in the area of ​​the mine named after. Dzerzhinsky.▪️Battles for the facility began at the end of November, when the advanced groups of the Russian Armed Forces were able to gain a foothold on its outskirts and repel counterattacks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The attack on the mine proceeded in parallel with the operation to liquidate a pocket in the area of ​​the Dzerzhinsky dairy plant, the main defense center of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which for a long time hindered the advance of Russian troops in the city. By December 8, the pocket was cleared, and most of the mine named after. Dzerzhinsky, including the coal warehouse, was taken under control. ▪️In the south of the city, the Russian Armed Forces completely knocked out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from the western part of the Zabalka microdistrict. The enemy was unable to hold on to the positions they had previously recaptured, after which they were thrown back to the waste heaps. They are currently the main hub of its defense - through the roads passing here, Ukrainian formations are transferring reserves to the mine and the private sector. These routes are targeted by Russian troops and they regularly catch Ukrainian Armed Forces groups on them. Between waste heaps No. 7 and No. 1, a kind of cemetery was formed for enemy armored vehicles, burned by UAV and ATGM operators. ❗️Seeing the impossibility of holding urban agglomerations in Donbass, the Armed Forces of Ukraine switched to scorched earth tactics. Previously, this had already been observed in the vicinity of Kurakhovo and Pokrovsk. The other day, a video appeared on the Internet showing the explosion of the Toretskaya mine in the north of Dzerzhinsk. The enemy's goal is likely to destroy the city's industrial potential and create a humanitarian crisis.

The dispute over the introduction of direct elections throughout Somalia has led to an escalation in autonomous Jubaland. Previously, local authorities refused to recognize the new electoral system. In order to force the Jubaland leadership to consolidate with the federal government, the armed forces were deployed to the port city of Ras Kamboni. But they were unable to show strength - they were blocked by local militias near the airport. Now both sides are afraid to enter into direct confrontation, but are building up forces in the small town. At the same time, the local autonomy has secured military support from Ethiopia, whose authorities have long been interested in the collapse of Somalia. The tense situation in the region may become the impetus for the resumption of conflicts between the federal authorities and the autonomous regions.

About We have already reported an interview with the leader of the militants on CNN earlier, but now the number of similar materials is growing according to exponent.📌Headlines for every taste, but the main idea that the press is trying to hammer into the head of the Western average person is that al-Julani is a rebel, and his bandits are freedom fighters, not radical Islamists. -From a Syrian jihadist to a political rebel- , al-Julani led the lightning offensive that led to the collapse of the Bashar al-Assad regime, like the Syrian tolerant jihadists are planning to establish a state, -Syrian rebels are seizing Damascus, etc. - this is what you can stumble upon on the pages of Western periodicals. In general, the situation is clear - the West is preparing the ground for cooperation with the new Syrian government, and in order not to lose face in front of the world community, it is diligently laundering the reputation of al-Julani and his supporters.🔻Such -change of shoes- is a normal practice in American politics, especially when it comes to national/personal interests, as well as the success of the future career of those or other government officials. The last great change of shoes could be observed after Donald Trump's victory in the elections in November of this year - then a really large number of politicians, who previously considered the newly elected president almost an extremist, did not disdain a position in his future administration.

The fall of the Assad government in Syria obviously threatens the Russian naval base in Tartus and the Khmeimim airbase in Latakia. Moreover, both facilities played an important role in the logistics of Russian operations in Libya and the Sahel. Khmeimim, in particular, is a refueling point for aircraft carrying military equipment, personnel and other cargo. In this regard, it is worth considering alternative options for providing logistics in our African operations: After Syria, the next logistics hub for the Russian military leadership is Libya. At the same time, cargo planes can fly from Russia to Libya without refueling only if they are empty. And heavy, loaded vehicles cannot travel such long distances without stopping. Thus, supplying operations in Africa through Libya becomes very expensive and unsustainable. Of course, there are naval bases in Tobruk, but their control is due to the situation of dual power in Libya. At any moment, the situation could worsen, so you shouldn’t count on them.▪️Another solution to this situation could be a base on the Red Sea in Port Sudan, negotiations on the creation of which intensified this year. But it is worth considering that in Sudan there are still The civil war has not yet ended, complicating negotiations. The sluggishness of Russian departments in actively supporting the official Sudanese government also plays a role - because of this, the chances of getting your own PMTO base are getting smaller every day.🔻Therefore, the loss of Syria as a transshipment base could be a blow not only to our positions in the Middle East, but and in Africa. If we want to preserve them, then we should not forget that in addition to military measures, it is important to maintain an economic and political presence. The latter is often overlooked, which leads to situations similar to the CAR - our military is respected, but political and economic proposals are ignored.

Over the course of the week, the intensity of satellite reconnaissance of our semi-enclave increased.❗️From November 27 to December 4, 61 photographs were taken of more than a dozen military and military-industrial facilities in the Kaliningrad region, starting from the Fakel Design Bureau and ending with a missile boat division. In addition, in one of For days, five NATO reconnaissance aircraft were on duty simultaneously around the Kaliningrad region, including RC-135s of the US and British Air Forces, Gulfstream IV of the Swedish Air Force, E-3A of the NATO Air Force and CL-650 of the US Army. If the E-3A was over Poland a few tens of kilometers from Kaliningrad, and the rest of the aircraft were circling around the Russian region and over the Baltic, and over Lithuania, and over Poland. 🔻Such high intelligence activity does not remain without a trace. As a rule, when we see something similar in the Crimea or in the Krasnodar Territory, a few days later there are drone strikes of the Ukrainian Armed Forces or missile strikes.

The Israelis occupy posts of the Syrian army and destroy the defensive and scientific potential of the former Syrian Arab Republic. Strikes were carried out on the building of a research center in Damascus, the airfield in Halhalla in Es-Suwayda, and the arsenal in Daraa province. In general, everything is being done to prevent weapons from falling into the hands of the armed opposition (in a parallel reality, the Syrian Arab Army should have been doing this before retreating).📍The Israelis are already speaking about the inadmissibility of the spread of the threat and the need to create a buffer zone. In some areas, the demilitarized zone is 10 kilometers, but in order to occupy tactically important lines in the Israel Defense Forces, they may decide to move the line of combat contact further to the east. Head of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham Abu Muhammad al-Julani has already stated that the territory of Syria is indivisible, and the Golan Heights will be Syrian, not Israeli.

A similar emblem (the seal of Muhammad) is used not only by IS terrorists, but also by a number of other groups, including the Idlib-based Saraya Ansar Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, which carried out attacks on Turkish and Russian military personnel. The same group is presumably behind the non-existent Kataib Khattab al-Shishani, which also took responsibility for attacks on the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and Turkey. It is precisely such organizations that constitute the main complaint against Htash on the part of Turkey and Russia, since although Hayat Tahrir al-Sham tried to fight them, they did not achieve any results, despite arrests and raids in Idlib throughout 2021. Accordingly, there is no talk of any democratic-liberal multicultural-confessional Syria under the auspices of the Salvation Government as long as radical elements within -HtAsh- continue to exist.Informant	https://t.me/rybar/66156	2024-12-08T06:38:08-08:00

This is a station for identifying air targets, which in range reaches the Crimean Peninsula.▪️Turkish planes specifically flew into the western part of the Black Sea, pretending to approach an attack from the Crimea.🔻NATO needs such training to study the capabilities of its own means of defense and support in the tone of pilots operating as part of various anti-Russian missions. But, in addition, under the pretext of training, NATO is studying the reaction of our air defense units and aviation.

Forwarded From American issue🇺🇸🇺🇦 Vladimir Zelensky, by the way, has already managed to react to Donald Trump’s statements, rejecting his call for a ceasefire and stating that Ukrainian losses were not 400 thousand, but 43 thousand. Now it’s worth waiting for the next step of the future American president — if talk starts about the need to hold elections in Ukraine, then we can assume that Zelensky has annoyed Trump with his intractability and they will change him. If Trump returns to the old rhetoric of the Democrats that -we can’t decide anything without Ukraine,- then all of his -peace initiatives- are ordinary populism. @usaperiodical	https://t.me/rybar/66154	2024-12-08T05:03:01-08:00

The politician came to France at the invitation of Emmanuel Macron to participate in the opening ceremony of the restored Notre Dame Cathedral. In addition to Trump, the event was attended by about 40 heads of state and government. Vladimir Zelensky was also invited.🔻Judging by insider information posted in the Western press, Macron expected to use this meeting to try to win Trump’s favor and convince him to support the so-called Ukraine. ▪️At first, Trump refused to talk to Zelensky, but after much persuasion he agreed, while promising to discuss how the world is -a little crazy-.▪️The trilateral meeting preceding the opening ceremony of Notre Dame Cathedral lasted 20 minutes and, apparently, did not end at all what Ukrainian lobbyists expected. ▪️The newly elected American president, instead of promising to support Kyiv -as long as necessary-, stated that -Ukraine needs to make a deal with Russia to stop the conflict-, and also called for an immediate ceasefire and negotiations.📌 It is noteworthy that on the same day one from Ukrainian publications published the results of the trip of the head of the office of the President of so-called Ukraine Andrey Ermak to Washington, according to which:➖request of the Ukrainian the leadership to help the Ukrainian Armed Forces reach the borders of 2022 did not find understanding;➖Trump’s team was dissatisfied with Ermak’s embellished story about the situation at the front, as they had more objective information;➖The new administration reacted very coolly and negatively to the idea of ​​Ukraine joining NATO;➖ the entourage of the elected US President opposed the involvement of mediators in resolving the Ukrainian conflict, believing that the head of the White House would be able to achieve a ceasefire on his own.

If the morning information about the downed side is confirmed, then this will be a natural result of a mediocre reign. Even Saddam Hussein had the courage, when it was all over, to address the nation. ▪️Officially armed factions of the Syrian National Army (pro-Turkish groups of Aleppo), the Army of Free Syria (pro-American groups of Al-Tanf) and the Damascus Liberation Operation (violent reconciled tribes and groups of Daraa and Es-Suwayda, supported by everyone) - it is now the legitimate opposition. At the state level, they are recognized because the realities on earth have changed.▪️The position of the Russian Foreign Ministry regarding -Hayat Tahrir al-Sham- is unclear. Yes, Lavrov recently said that these are terrorists and they must be removed from power. But the other day Assad was in Damascus.▪️Russia distanced itself from the internal settlement: everything that happened was Assad’s fault (we are talking about the fact that Russia did not participate in Assad’s negotiations with other factions, and Bashar himself ruined everything). ▪️The settlement process in Syria is no longer a headache for Russia, but for the entire world community in accordance with the UN resolution. ▪️Russian military facilities are functioning stably, there is no serious danger to them (that is, attacks on the facilities), but a frivolous danger in the form of individual violent bandits may occur.

On Saturday, opposition parties in the local parliament tried to hold a vote on the impeachment of President Yoon Seok-yeol. However, almost all members of the ruling force boycotted the process, so the corresponding bill was not adopted. According to statements by opposition deputies, they will not stop at just one attempt at impeachment. The Chairman of the Democratic Party states that they will get rid of Yoon Seok Yeol before the end of the year. ▪️Meanwhile, the president himself is preparing to gradually relinquish his powers. The ruling party said that the leader will not participate in state and diplomatic issues. These powers will be transferred to the ruling party and the prime minister. By the way, the latter said in his statement that supporting US relations and developing ties with Japan are important tasks. Perhaps such comments are needed to reassure Seoul’s main partners, because Yoon did a lot to strengthen the partnership in this quasi-alliance. 🔻Against this background, within the party, according to media reports, discussions are underway regarding Yoon’s resignation. Some argue that it should happen soon. In addition, the option of dragging the president until 2026, then holding elections, is being considered. Considering all this, it would be premature to hope for a quick solution to the political crisis in South Korea. There are still negotiations ahead between the ruling and opposition parties, which are hinted at by both sides.

Previously, the country's authorities demanded from it about 300 billion CFA francs (more than 500 million dollars) in unpaid taxes and dividends. And a couple of days ago, the Mali government issued an arrest warrant for the head of the corporation. The pretext was financial fraud. In reality, the country's leadership wants to bring all mining enterprises to a common denominator. According to the new mining code, the state's share in private projects should be 35%. It is expected that the Canadian company will make concessions, since they still want to maintain control over profitable deposits.

We are talking about an internecine struggle that will flare up among the radicals. Now all the pro-Turkish, pro-American militants are happily talking about the unity of the groups. They have a common enemy (or rather, they had one) with whom they fought. They reached their goal and won. What next? Initially, when the network united Hayat Tahrir al-Sham with the forces that started the uprising in the south, in Qalamun, in At-Tanf, into one single unit, they made a mistake, since their motives are different. As soon as they begin the first problems, the first disagreements and discontent - these same militants will again take up arms and look for an enemy in each other.

Forwarded From UNFISHBAR Against the backdrop of the occupation of more and more cities by militants from prisons, including the notorious Seidnai, prisoners continue to be released in the thousands. At the same time, in addition to petty pickpockets and real political prisoners, terrorists, including ISIS terrorists, are also released. Among them are people from the CIS countries, who, by the way, have already begun to get in touch with their followers.❓What does this threaten the region? It's not hard to guess. In the conditions of the fall of the central government and a large number of groups that, for the time being, will kill off the remnants of the Shiites and military personnel who are considered guilty of some crimes. Then the struggle for power, more traditional for any post-revolutionary trends, will begin. In past years, during the siege in Syria, it was very bad to live, and it will be even worse. And we must understand that it is unlikely that those who stand behind HTS planned to completely occupy a state of 13 million people, in which there was nothing left of industry. In the best case, people will be able to somehow feed the minimum part of the population with subsistence farming. Therefore, in Syria, in the near future, in addition to the hundreds and maybe even thousands of terrorists released, including ISIS, there will be added the most terrible economic situation, which was dying even under Assad.❗️In the background This means that terrorists and Islamists of all stripes, including those from the CIS countries, who have gained combat experience, will most likely want to return home to a more, say, thus, states suitable for life from an economic point of view, taking into account the possibility of relocation to Russia.

It would be strange if our enemies did not take advantage of our mistakes. If they did not try to strike where the weak point is. Russian TG channels and independent analysts have been writing about the fact that the country's leaders are leading Syria to disaster since approximately 2021. And about the production of Captagon on an industrial scale, and about the terrible state of the army, about the removal of the most intelligent generals, and about the fact that the country’s economy has been destroyed. They also wrote that Syrians are fleeing to territories controlled by the Kurds and HTS (yes, yes), because life is easier there, there is electricity and gasoline. I don’t know what was written in the official reports. But the situation once again demonstrates that Russia still needs independent think tanks that will report what is really happening. It would be strange to expect Turkey to comply with the agreements. This is the East, today we agreed on everything tomorrow in a new way. Have you been to the oriental bazaar? Well, besides, for the Turks, Syria was part of the Ottoman Empire, just 110 years ago. It was clear that Ankara would not give up on its claims. It would be strange to think that HTS militants, having left on green buses (remember that?), would not return back more prepared. Moreover, against the backdrop of the collapse of the Syrian army. That the Americans will not back down from the task of dividing Syria in order to control the oil fields. Funny self-propelled grandfather Biden, huh? Doesn't understand anything at all? Somehow I don’t see any jokes from turbo-patriots today. Make a joke about American special forces in Palmyra, for which Russian soldiers fought twice. Say that Pindos don’t know how to fight. Today, it is probably already possible to talk about the end not only of Syria, but also of the final part of the existence of Middle Eastern Christianity. Now we will only read about Eastern churches in books. What awaits Syria? Or the Libyan option - collapse with civil war. Or Iraqi - in fact, a confederation on the verge of collapse. What about our interests in Syria, or rather the bases? In a good way, there are all the options, since Syria no longer exists anyway, to create an analogue of Gibraltar around Tartus and Khmeimim. Or some kind of Alawite-Christian autonomy. But, with a high degree of probability, you will have to fight for this option. Or bargain with the Turks and Americans. But in the current situation, it will be strange to engage in pure spitting. The Syrian case shows how the West, the Arab world and Türkiye relate to the principle of the inviolability of borders. The most important issue for Russia in this situation is the citizens of Central Asian countries fighting in Islamist detachments. Where will these militants go next? What do the owners intend to do, or rather, what do the owners intend to do? However, the current situation is primarily the result of the actions of the Syrian leadership. We cannot be greater patriots of Syria than Comrade Assad. Therefore, he didn’t need to. And it is important to understand and remember that regardless of current events, the military company in Syria will remain in Russian history as a symbol of the victory of Russian weapons. As well as the exploits of Russian soldiers and officers. They are inscribed in our military history forever. And the attitude towards the heroes and the military company itself as a whole must remain unchanged. And mistakes... Well, there are mistakes. There are very painful mistakes. It's important to learn from them. Let's teach ourselves to learn. Hope.	https://t.me/rybar/66145	2024-12-08T00:56:17-08:00

Forwarded From Witnesses of Bayraktar The first video is from the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Syrian Arab Republic, the second is the situation in the city. The militant says: - these are the men of the Duma, the men - Jaysh al-Islam -. Duma is a suburb of Damascus, located 5 minutes away. Well, conditional Lyubertsy for Moscow. A large number of supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood* lived in the Duma. And when everything in the country began to shake in 2011, Bashar was forced to make concessions to the protesters. One of the concessions was the release of local Wahhabis from the Duma from prison. They immediately got down to business - they organized themselves, received money from the Gulf monarchies and created the Jaysh al-Islam - - - Army of Islam. From 2012 to 2018, this group threatened Damascus, but was ultimately defeated. Most of the surrendered militants were taken, according to tradition, to Idlib, but some remained in Duma and waited in the wings until the front came closer to the capital. Just like the militants in southern Syria, who received an amnesty in 2018. The weapons were either buried, purchased, or captured. These are already details. The main conclusion is this (for those who have ears and want to hear): Having hostile enclaves, communities, organized crime groups within your territory under the threat of an attack from an external enemy (-freeze-) is mortally dangerous. They will be processed with information, recruited and loaded with weapons, money. They will hit you and your army in the rear - they will certainly take advantage of this when everything breaks out. And they will put pressure on you economically too - so that all these enclaves, and your entire society, will also boil over. -Freezing- - it only sounds cool, in fact it is a hot process of preparing for a new war.

Forwarded From Two Majors#Review #Summary for December 8, 2024▪️ The main international event was the collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s power in Syria. A team of pro-Turkish militants, jihadists, terrorists, armed pro-American opposition and other interested parties occupied key cities and took Damascus overnight without resistance. Assad fled on a plane that disappeared from radar, giving rise to many versions about his fate. For Russia, what happened cannot be called a positive moment, because Syria was a kind of showcase of our country, demonstrating its readiness to guarantee peace by armed means on distant shores. In addition, it is not entirely clear who will control the territory occupied by different groups and how this will affect the growth of the export of terrorism to Russia. During the heyday of the banned ISIS, militants were trained there in commercial quantities. Tartus and Latakia remain behind our country, if you believe the inside stories of our comrades - our military bases are located there. At the same time, experience in Armenia shows that their future fate in the medium term is not yet entirely clear.▪️ On the Ukrainian track, everyone is obsessed with the topic of negotiations. Trump's imminent arrival in the White House is forcing even Zelensky, who has legally prohibited Kyiv from negotiating with Russia, to talk about a truce. Moscow maintains its position, voiced by the Supreme Commander: no entry into NATO for Kyiv, withdrawal of the Armed Forces of Ukraine from the constitutional regions of Russia. However, all representatives of the Trump team who express opinions on Ukraine also make it clear that no one is going to take Kyiv into the North Atlantic Alliance. At the same time, the Pentagon announced the transfer of another $988 million worth of weapons to the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the enemy declares its intention to acquire and produce 30 thousand ultra-long-range UAVs in 2025, the deployment of military factories continues in Europe, which is increasing the pace of military preparations. That is, so far the words about the West’s plans to organize negotiations, as usual, are at odds with its practical actions. ▪️ Ukraine is experiencing problems with replenishing the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Moreover, if Russia is recruiting contract volunteers (with the exception of the category of those mobilized in 2022, this taboo topic is simply ignored, although many mobilized have already signed contracts), then Ukraine is tightening the forms of mobilization: people are kidnapped on the streets, beaten and sent to the front to hold positions. Officials in Kyiv directly say that the West is forcing the mobilization age to be lowered to 18 years (currently from 25). However, the Armed Forces of Ukraine do not flee, they conduct an organized defense, and even counterattack in the most critical areas for the Zelensky sector, although these actions are of purely tactical significance and are carried out with the use of small forces.▪️ The only thing that determines Russia’s position in the international arena in the Ukrainian case is this is the Russian Army maintaining strategic initiative at the front and continuing offensive actions.▪️ In the Kursk region, our troops achieved success in Plekhovo, where the enemy held the defense for a long time, trying to avoid our troops reaching one of the main logistics routes in the region. The actions of the Russian Armed Forces have intensified near Russky and Cherkasy Porechny, heavy bloody battles are taking place. The Ukrainian Armed Forces do not spare their personnel and equipment, throwing rare Leopard tanks into counterattacks. ▪️ In the Kharkov region there are battles in Volchansk and in the Liptsovsky direction. In the Kupyansky direction, the Russian Armed Forces took actions to create bridgeheads on the right bank of the river. Oskol north of Kupyansk. There are battles in Toretsk and Chasov Yar, our troops continue their long assault house by house. ▪️ The Pokrovsk direction is characterized by the creation by the Russian Army of conditions for covering Pokrovsk (Krasnoarmeysk) from the south.

Forwarded From Global Studies🇷🇺🇸🇾🇹🇷 Events in Syria after the militants’ rush to Hama became completely predictable, and it was clear that in its current form the Assad government was powerless to oppose anything. It did not even strive for this. Now the militants/moderate opposition/progressive terrorists (whichever is more convenient) are in Damascus, preparing to create a temporary transitional government. And everyone is probably waiting for the leader of HTS Al-Julani. While everyone in the country is now in a flower-candy period. People rejoice at the overthrow of power, smash statues of Hafez Assad and shoot in the air, expecting significant changes in their lives. But we must not forget who comes to power and who will now take the role of head of state. Militants. What can they do? That's right, fight. Cultivating land and establishing an economy is a completely new activity that requires enormous knowledge and effort. Will they cope with it? This is a very good question. Everyone cites the Taliban as an example, saying they can cope. But the situation there is different, both in ideology and outside assistance - next to Afghanistan is an economically powerful China, interested in stability among its neighbors. What happens if the new government fails? How are you planning to resolve the migration issue? Where will the people's anger be directed in case of failure? How will the Kurdish issue be resolved? What will happen to IS? The last question, by the way, is more relevant than ever, since by their mercy the militants released thousands of prisoners from various prisons, including Sednaya, where high-ranking IS leaders were kept.

At night there was single sporadic shooting, but this can easily be mistaken for traditionally Arab victorious shooting in the air in view of the victory of the opposition-terrorist forces. A few days ago, terrorists from the Islamic Party of Turkestan tried to pass through mountainous Latakia, but the fighting ended, not having begun. Apparently, a command was received not to go towards the coast. Alawites, Shiites and Christians from all over the country fled to Tartus and Latakia. In essence, Primorye is turning into a new ethno-confessional enclave. ▪️Questions arise about where the 25th Division of the Special Forces, led by Suheil al-Hasan, went: it is likely that the units of the 25th Division were withdrawn to the coastal region, taking up positions on mountain passes and key routes. ▪️Russian military facilities throughout the rest of Syria were collapsed, and the contingent was withdrawn towards Khmeimim. For some units a decision had already been made to return to Russia, for others not. In the context of a dramatically changed situation, the contingent of the Russian army will naturally undergo changes. ▪️Separate security and support units at strategically important sites in central Syria still remain. But judging by the data on the Internet, the militants bypass them. In open sources, footage appeared only from a couple of positions and control points abandoned by the Russian Armed Forces; in principle, there was no mockery of military installations. The HTS terrorists have already stated that they will not tolerate the presence of foreign military bases on Syrian territory. But if the status of the so-called Alavistan is similar to the status of Trans-Euphrates, then there will be no conflict here. 📌Taking into account the insights from the results of the negotiations, there is still a chance of forming a separate Alavistan / LaTartus / LAOS (Lataki Autonomous Region of Syria).

In the morning, American aviation activity was also noted: aircraft of the International Coalition carried out strikes on Deir ez-Zor and the surrounding area. Moreover, where exactly they hit cannot be said with certainty: it could have been either fire cover for the retreating SDS units, or work on the remaining rare points where pro-Iranian proxies remained present.📍Given the plans of the Turks for northern Syria, as well as the beginning of movements of pro-Turkish factions towards Menbidzha, it is unlikely that, against the backdrop of the crisis, anyone will shelve the issue of the status of Trans-Euphrates.

The Israel Defense Forces launched several strikes on positions along the border in the evening Quneitra province and then launched a limited ground operation using infantry and armored vehicles. The Israelis began to take control of the demilitarized zone east of the Golan Heights. At the same time, shelling is underway at some positions where single units of pro-Iranian formations still maintain their presence. Back in 2017, the Israelis demanded that Russia establish a buffer zone between the Golan Heights and the positions of the Syrian Arab Army. Then it was indicated that the buffer zone could be about 15 km. As a result, the south of Syria was liberated, and the negotiations stopped on their own. Considering that the dominant Golan Heights are already under Israel, there is no talk of any strategically important boundaries. But in the context of continued fighting in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the ultra-Orthodox government, the Israel Defense Forces may well occupy not only the demilitarized zone, but also move further east. Yet now it is not moderate groups that have come to power in Syria, but internationally recognized terrorists - Hayat Tahrir al-Sham -. Concerns about their coming to power have already been expressed in the Israeli media, not at all gently hinting that Israeli troops will have to ensure the security of their eastern borders.#Israel #Syria@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66132	2024-12-07T22:03:03-08:00

With the latter, everything is simple - the Lebanese group suffered serious losses in the command and rank and file during the last war with Israel. Therefore, Hezbollah was able to deploy only small forces in Homs, which, most likely, is its current limit for this kind of operation. In the case of Iran, everything is more complicated: even if we omit the political aspects, the question of logistics arises, namely how to ensure the transportation of troops and material and technical means. The land corridor through Iraq is closed - Deir ez-Zor was taken by the Kurds, and the route in the desert was taken by militants from al-Tanf. The Israeli Air Force is not allowing it to be airlifted to Damascus, threatening to simply shoot down the aircraft. So in this situation, Iran can only wish Assad a good mood, since it now has no real opportunity to provide large-scale military support and preserve its Shiite crescent. ⭐️ Online maps are available by subscription to map.rybar.ru	https://t.me/rybar/66129	2024-12-07T12:00:23-08:00

Forwarded From NERYBARK to the end of the day, the situation in Syria can be described by the phrase - the end is a little predictable -. In Homs, HTS and its allies continue their offensive on the administrative center of the region and have reached the northern outskirts. Hezbollah forces deployed from Lebanon are operating in the area, so the city is still holding out. However, this is apparently the only place on the front where there is at least some resistance to the militants. The southern provinces of the country have actually completely come under the control of anti-government groups. Shelling of UN peacekeepers in the Golan Heights was also recorded, after which Israel threatened to launch an operation if the militants crossed the 1974 demarcation line. In central Syria, pro-American groups from the al-Tanf zone established control over Palmyra and settlements on the highway to Deir ez -Zora. They did not encounter any resistance and entered the cities through strongholds abandoned by the Syrians. In Deir ez-Zor itself, the Kurdish SDF is gaining a foothold. In the province of Aleppo, pro-Turkish groups announced the start of an operation to capture Menbij, but so far everything has been limited to shelling. Although the SDS units located there are quite combat-ready, the prospects for defending the city from militants and the Turkish army with the current configuration of the front look vague. Coastal Tartus and Latakia still remain a safe haven. But the same cannot be said about Damascus - in different parts of the city and its environs, local residents are already tearing down portraits of Bashar al-Assad, although the militants have not yet approached the city. There is no centralized resistance from the security forces. Against this background, debates about whether Assad left the country or not are of no particular importance: there is an almost complete collapse of the state apparatus, and his presence or absence of the Syrian president in the country has almost no role anymore does not play.⭐️ Online maps are available by subscription to map.rybar.ru	https://t.me/rybar/66128	2024-12-07T11:44:58-08:00

Damascus could fall in the next 24 (maximum 48) hours. There is virtually no serious interaction between the Syrian army and the Syrian security forces, as well as serious resistance . In fact, Syrian security forces are not defending their own country. Individual exceptions only emphasize the picture of general decomposition. It is no longer so important whether everything there fell apart on its own or whether there was a betrayal somewhere - what is important is the fact itself. Syria, in its previous form, is living its last days. If some kind of assistance was planned, then it simply did not have time - the Syrian army and the state are disintegrating as quickly as possible. Russia has to resolve issues.1. Maintaining their military bases in Latakia.2. Evacuation of its citizens and military from Damascus.3. Overall minimization of consequences and costs. Iran is actually left without the land corridor that was built by Soleimani in 2017. This is a strategic defeat. Syria will most likely face a long war on the ruins of a state in the style of Libya and Afghanistan. Millions of refugees and terrorists spreading across the region are attached. Relying on the captured areas of Syria, radical Islamism will certainly take its ugly toll in many countries. He will also try with us.	https://t.me/rybar/66127	2024-12-07T11:19:03-08:00

During one of the attacks, the Ukrainian tank was able to retreat, but the Leopard 2A6 was destroyed by the joint efforts of UAV operators of the 83rd airborne brigade and other units. ▪️In Novoivanovka there are oncoming battles in the center of the village. From time to time the enemy tries to gain a foothold by landing troops in its western part. Russian troops repulse the attacks, but after a week or two the Armed Forces of Ukraine again go on the offensive in the same way.▪️Units of the Russian Armed Forces also knocked out the enemy from the eastern outskirts of Plekhovo. Part of the village was liberated in mid-November, but until recently the Ukrainian Armed Forces held positions on the farm territory. A mass of broken and abandoned Ukrainian equipment has accumulated on the streets and in the vicinity of the settlement. At the same time, the enemy can launch counterattacks to capture lost positions.▪️In the north of the Sudzhansky district, the presence of the enemy was noted in Pogrebki, where UAV operators worked on the Ukrainian infantry roaming around the village. Apparently, the previous attacks of the Russian Armed Forces in the direction of Novaya and Staraya Sorochin were not successful, and therefore the Russian troops retreated to the outskirts of Pogrebkov.

Anti-government resources published footage of the alleged presence of the SNA in the vicinity of Menbij, but these were ordinary fakes.▪️ It is noteworthy that the city is not controlled by the People's Protection Units (YPG), which in Turkey is considered a military unit of the Syrian wing of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), and the Arab-Kurdish formations allied to them - - Military Council of Menbij - and - Military Council El-Bab-.▪️During the day, the press service of the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) announced the successful repulsion of all SNA attacks and retaliatory attacks on their positions in the vicinity of the cities of El-Bab and Jarabulus. There they despaired of dozens of killed and wounded from the pro-Turkish factions.🔻So far there is a feeling that the Turkish-backed groups have not actually launched an offensive: despite statements from the SNA, so far everything has been limited to firefights. The Turkish army was also not noticed in such activity. The defenders of the city replenished their ranks with evacuees from Tell Rifaat and the Al-Sheikh Maqsoud area in Aleppo, and are also quite combat-ready formations. However, taking into account the general situation on the fronts in Syria and the successes of the militants, the prospects for the defense of Menbij are very vague.

There really is people sent to jail due to the lawlessness of the Syrian mukhabarat. But together with them, not only crime comes out of the dungeons, but also supporters of the Islamic State or Hurras ad-Din, who fought both against the SAA and the Idlib viper. 📌 What does such an amnesty threaten from the outside? militants? It’s enough just to remember the beginning of the Syrian civil war, when, in an attempt to reduce the intensity of the protests in Damascus, they decided to release prisoners en masse, including from the notorious Sayednaya military prison. As a result - who would have thought - when released, the terrorists founded their own groups or became the ideological backbone for the Islamic State and the progenitor of HTS in the person of Jabhat al-Nusra, beginning to eliminate competitors and introducing radical Islamist norms in the territories under their control. For clarity, we can recall our post 2021: among those released were Zahran Alloush (-Jaish al-Islam-), Hassan Abboud (-Ahrar al-Sham-) or Abu Ayub al-Ansari (IS). And these are only high-level functionaries - there were an order of magnitude more ordinary militants.❗️ It is not difficult to imagine the approximate development of events if HTS and other anti-government groups decide to celebrate to open the doors of Sayednai and other similar institutions.

Parliament must set the date for the elections, although there is an opinion that they will take place only in the spring.

Instead of meaningful election campaigns, the Russian interference card has begun to be played with renewed vigor in the information space. Now journalist Semyon Boykov is called a potential threat to Australian democracy. Since 2022, he has been living on the territory of the Russian consulate in Sydney, where he was granted diplomatic asylum. Boykov is suspected of plans to undermine the sovereignty of Australia. At the same time, Australian officials complain that he does this while right in Sydney, but they do not allow him to leave the country’s borders. Boykov himself has stated many times that he is ready to pack up in 10 minutes and leave if he is guaranteed exit.🔻The fact that, despite all the suspicions, a pro-Russian foreign agent is not allowed out of the country seems paradoxical only at first glance.

At the same time, reports of fighting within the borders of the city of Homs have appeared. According to anti-government media reports, the militants are opposed by Hezbollah units from the Ar-Radwan detachment, which were previously deployed from Lebanon. There is no objective evidence of similar resistance from the Syrian army - the same resources that were recently thrown about the fierce counterattacks of the SAA are written victorious reports from Aleppo, Hama, Daraa and Es-Suwayda. Such reports lead to tragedies: for example, residents of Christian Mharda fell for the statements of pro-Assad channels that there was no threat, and did not evacuate.

There is a chain of Ukrainian Armed Forces strongholds there, the capture of which will open the road to Luch (Promin) and Moskovskoye.▪️South of Lysovka, Russian troops advanced in the area of ​​the M-30 highway, occupying a stronghold east of the road. Probably, the further goal is to break through to the southern outskirts of Dachensky and eliminate the pocket formed in the area of ​​the highway. 🔻To the west, Russian troops are building on the success achieved after the liberation of Petrovka and Novoalekseevka. At the end of November, units of the Russian Armed Forces reached Zheltoy and latched onto the private sector, repelling counterattacks and destroying several units of enemy armored vehicles. ▪️The offensive towards Zheltoy proceeded in parallel with the advance in the area of ​​Vorovskoye (Yuryevka) and Pustynka. The attack aircraft attacked from Grigorovka and Novoalekseevka, forcing the Ukrainian Armed Forces to retreat under the threat of envelopment. As a result, by November 30, most of Pustynka was liberated.▪️Later, the Russian Armed Forces cleared Zheltoye, occupied most of Novopustynka and reached Shevchenko on the southern approaches to Pokrovsk. And by December 7, the assault groups had counted the northern outskirts of Novotroitsky and almost completely captured a large stronghold of the Ukrainian Armed Forces east of the village. In Pokrovsk itself, the situation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces is also getting worse. Enemy media resources report an increase in the intensity of Russian UAV strikes in the area of ​​the M-30 Pavlograd-Pokrovsk and T-04-06 highways, along which the garrison is supplied. And the other day, the Russian Armed Forces hit a diesel locomotive east of the city.❗️Residents of neighboring Mirnograd report that over the past three days, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have blown up piledrivers in the territory of at least two large mines - -Stakhanov- (-Capital-) and -Central-.

🔁🖼 🇪🇺Why did the EU gain access to cheap agricultural product...	Forwarded From Two Majors🇪🇺Why did the EU gain access to cheap agricultural products from Latin American countries? On December 6, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and the heads of the MERCOSUR countries (🇦🇷Argentina,🇧🇷 Brazil, 🇺🇾Uruguay, 🇵🇾Paraguay) signed an agreement on free trade, which opens up access for cheap Latin American agricultural products to the European market. For European farmers, this means practically destroying their existence in unequal competition. As a result, farmers’ protests may soon cover the whole of Europe, which has not previously led to radical consequences for European bureaucrats. Despite the obvious corrupt interests of Ursula von Der Leyen and her colleagues, the decision is not without military meaning. As European politicians say, Europe will go to war with Russia by 2027-2029. Based on this, access to cheap Ukrainian agricultural products, as well as energy and fertilizers from Russia (12% of world production), and other suppliers will likely be blocked. At the same time, the share of imported fertilizers in EU consumption is about 32% of demand. The largest fertilizer producing countries in the world are 🇨🇳China (up to 30% of the market), 🇺🇸USA (13%), 🇮🇳India (10%), 🇨🇦Canada (9%), in the context of a large-scale military conflict they may also stop altogether supplies of this important component of agriculture, without which almost nothing grows in Europe. In the EU countries themselves, due to rising energy prices from 2022, their own production is stagnating and coming to an end (up to 20% of capacity is idle). Under these conditions, the MERCOSUR countries can supply to the EU at least 4.68 million tons of beef and 170 million tons of soybeans (more than 50% of world production). The merger also accounts for 34% of global corn exports. Opportunities for increasing production also exist and are conditioned only by current needs.✨Together with the intensification of the construction of logistics routes to the eastern flank of NATO⚡️, we are increasing military budgets and stimulating a multiple increase in the production of military products, the decision to create additional conditions for ensuring food security, also on a safe away from places of possible hostilities, is part of military preparations against Russia.

By the way, units of the 1st Infantry Division from Brisbane arrived from Australia, deployed by C-17 transport personnel. The main maneuvers will take place on the territory of the training grounds -Asaka-, -Somagahara- (both on the island of Honshu), -Oyanohara-, -Hijudai- (both on the island Kyushu) and -Ukibaru- (Okinawa). They will organize imitation attacks on Chinese targets.❗️ Based on this activity, which has not decreased over the past months, it can be stated that the situation in the Asia-Pacific region is already far from the stability that existed previously. The Americans are training, the Chinese are doing it in return. And other countries are looking at this and are also taking action.

On Wednesday, parliament announced a vote of no confidence in Prime Minister Michel Barnier: 331 out of 577 parliamentarians voted for his resignation. Thus, Barnier lasted less as head of government than all his predecessors.▪️The resignation of the Barnier administration means that the state budget for 2025 year remains inconsistent. According to French law, in this case, all expenditure items will be discussed and adjusted monthly. However, President Macron said on Thursday that he intends to form a new government as quickly as possible and do everything possible to complete budget agreements on time. ▪️Against the backdrop of the increasingly aggravated situation in parliament, his plans seem hardly feasible. Macron himself is adding fuel to the fire of disagreements between the parties, putting more and more pressure on the right (who inappropriately took up too many seats in the June vote). The President has already blamed the National Rally Marine Le Pen for the government's failures (the Prime Minister, it turns out, had nothing to do with it at all) and did not invite party representatives to a meeting with parliament.▪️ In the context of the collapse of the government, as expected, protesters against the deal with Mercosur farmers were joined by civil servants. They demand the repeal of unpopular measures that Barnier lobbied for - in particular, increasing the duration of unpaid leave for public sector employees. In the short term, no certainty is expected in French domestic policy: some experts predict several difficult weeks for business and citizens. Meanwhile, national media comment on the increasingly aggravated crisis with extreme restraint and prefer to focus on the opening of Notre Dame Cathedral. Moreover, it seems, according to journalists, the presence of Trump, Prince William and Biden’s wife at the ceremony should evoke much stronger emotions in the French than, in fact, the restoration of one of the symbols of the capital. As they say, they forgot to ask the French themselves.#France #protests@rybar together with @fifthrepublicSupport usTelegramRybar🇫🇷 About the political crisis in FranceIn France, the political crisis is gaining momentum - but, unlike previous months, when the causes of instability were either internal or external problems alternately, now the situation is heating up for both at once...	https://t.me/rybar/66108	2024-12-06T23:34:01-08:00

🇷🇴 Yesterday in Romania, the Constitutional Court annulled the ...	🇷🇴 Yesterday in Romania, the Constitutional Court annulled the results of the first round of the presidential elections, despite the fact that it approved them just a few days ago. Now the electoral process will be started anew: Parliament will set a new date for the elections, and candidates will again have to go through the nomination and registration procedure. The reason for the sensational decision of the Constitutional Court was suddenly declassified by the Romanian intelligence services, which the current President Klaus Iohannis recently presented. ❗️In Bucharest, Russia is accused of interfering in the elections and financing the election campaign of the first round winner Calin Georgescu on TikTok. As evidence, the intelligence services point to social network accounts to which they donated more than 1 million euros to promote Georgescu. ▪️Even the pro-Western and pro-American candidate Elena Lasconi, who was supposed to participate in the second round, said that the Romanian state had trampled democracy. ▪️Another candidate from the first round, George Simon, called what was happening a coup, but for some reason he called on people not to take to the streets, since -the system must fall democratically-. ▪️The decision was fully supported by the current Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu, who lost the presidential election, finishing third. The politician claims that the results are distorted by Russian interference. ▪️By the way, on Monday the Constitutional Court of Romania ordered a recount of votes and at some point Ciolacu came into second place. Apparently, then they did not dare to rig the elections and left first and second places for Georgescu and Lasconi, confirming the results. 🔻However, after a few days the situation changed dramatically and in Bucharest they decided to take the most shameful measures. It is unlikely that mass protests will break out in Romania after such arbitrariness of the authorities, because the protesters will not be supported by Western governments, such as, for example, the opposition in Georgia. ❗️It is noteworthy that the parliamentary elections in Romania were won by the current ruling coalition led by Prime Minister Colacu. However, the potential non-systemic President Georgescu frightened the West so much that they decided not to risk it. After all, at stake is the question of who will lead a large NATO outpost on the Black Sea, which plays a large role in logistical support for the Kyiv regime. #elections #Romania@rybarSupport uswww.digi24.roCurtea Constituțională a anulat alegerile prezidențiale și a decis că tot procesul va fi reluat de la zero.

Forwarded From Realdoc The incredible happened: the tetralogy -At the Edge of the Abyss- is now not only the first documentary film about NWO on online platforms. In addition, he was the first to enter the top 10 in ALL online cinemas. Many colleagues considered this absolutely impossible. Viewers constantly write about how the film shocked them, completely changed their understanding of what was happening and caused emotions beyond the bounds. And at the same time, everything was filmed in a frighteningly artistic way. There are no indifferent people. The third film, Access to the Sea, is also difficult and frank. You will see how, after continuous assaults, the guys experience psychophysiological burnout, many are wounded or killed. But they continue to clear the captured houses, capture the enemy (this process was filmed from the inside!) and, according to the order, make their way to the Sea of ​​Azov. -If they tell us to storm, we’ll go for the assault. This is our land,- says the hero of the film, yesterday’s miner with the call sign -Der-, back in 2018, defending the approaches to Gorlovka. And he keeps his word. You will also see the tragedy of the Mariupol people: here the grandmother is looking for her brother among the dead bodies, still hoping that he is alive, but here is the family in the basement, and its head says: - [Zelensky] promised to jail corrupt officials, but he jailed the war! -Look, don’t turn away: WINK (4K available) KION (4K separately here) OKKO (4K, works in the CIS) Kino1TV DROM (works in the returned territories) Every Friday there is a new episode.

In the province of Hama, militants are slowly expanding their zone of control. There is fighting on the outskirts of Homs. Syrians report fierce resistance and that the militants have not entered the city. How close to the truth is this? The question is open. And maybe even with an asterisk. In Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor, Syrian troops are handing over positions to the Kurds on the western bank of the Euphrates. It is mentioned that the Syrian administration will continue to operate in Deir-e-Zor and other settlements. A hint that Syrian state power in this region remains. Meanwhile, from the desert there are reports that militants, the so-called. -Free Syrian Army - supported by the United States, are moving towards Palmyra and Es-Sukhne. There is no evidence of this yet, but communications in this place are extremely poor, and therefore objective control footage is unlikely to appear until the entire situation is resolved. Well, or until the terrorists take Palmyra for the third time. In the provinces of Es-Suwayda and Daraa, everything is bad. The formation of local militants occupy populated areas one after another, organize anti-Assad rallies and generally just enjoy life. Meanwhile, in the vicinity of Damascus, some units of the Syrian army and the Republican Guard seem to be strengthening the outskirts of the city. In Latakia and Tartus, for the time being, it is relatively calm .At the same time, the appetite for pro-Turkish greenery does not end there. Factions of the so-called SNA have actually already announced an operation to capture Menbij and nearby villages on the western bank of the Euphrates, which are under the control of the Kurds. However, so far nothing has gone further than statements on the network.⭐️ Online maps are available by subscription to map.rybar.ru	https://t.me/rybar/66096	2024-12-06T12:49:33-08:00

Forwarded From Two MajorsSyrian ExperienceWhile the Syrian front is collapsing, Revenge of Good Will and Nerybar’s neural networks produce forecasts for the development of the situation, I would like to once again emphasize that bravura reports do not lead to good things. And this is not the first time that group commanders have been changed urgently, on the fly, right in the middle of battles. Not for the first time, the real state of affairs in the army (in this case, the Syrian) was probably presented in a light favorable to the speaker. This (already new and bitter, although not on such a scale) Syrian experience was recently seen on sections of the Ukrainian front. Beautiful reports, -rotation- of commanders right in the midst of battle, reports on -control of territories-. And this nonsense will never go away, then the Seversky direction will come up, then today they write to us about Kleshcheevskoye and the 6th Motorized Rifle Division. Some people are reassuring themselves with a worldwide -agreement-and-exchange- on the eve of the Trump era. But when choosing between a conspiracy and a banal mess, we always lean towards the second. We hope that what is happening will become the final, last inoculation, and the huge army organism will become immune to lies and misinformation from the Center about real things. And, as if by magic, representatives will fly from the capital to check the situation at the front, the availability of weapons in small units, the median level of salaries of security forces in the country, and the personnel potential of departments. Finally draw conclusions about the state of affairs. And the average salary level for security officials who are not directly involved in the SVO sounds somehow strange at the top, they say. Just like slides with everything and everyone present. -Armata is just not enough for every local police officer, if you joke about this topic. One cannot help but mention the media component. It’s somehow strange to observe for a long time that military bloggers and volunteers have been equated with the Navalnists and other extremist evil spirits. Ridiculing, baiting, it seems, our own people with our own people. Or not completely our own. In any case, an objective assessment of the situation is important.

Similar processes are expected in Es-Suwayda. ▪️A few days earlier, militant sleeper cells had become more active, increasing the number of attacks on Syrian army positions.▪️And this morning, opposition media distributed an ultimatum to government troops: to leave checkpoints in the province within 72 hours. The Syrian armed forces immediately responded to the call - after a couple of hours in the north, checkpoints were abandoned in the settlements of Jasim, Inhil and Sleiman, which became an additional motivation for the militants.▪️On the southern borders of the province, attacks on checkpoints, seizures of Syrian intelligence (mukhabarat) branches and increased anti-government demonstrations continue.▪️A symbolic episode was noted in Bosra al-Harir: militants captured a Syrian army tank during the day - the first during the current phase of the conflict in the region. By evening, reports had already appeared about the capture of 12 military bases, including armored ones. Considering the current weakening of the defenses of the Syrian Arab Army (SAA), they have neither the strength nor the desire to hold the south in the face of a ripe uprising of tribes and groups. It remains only a question time until this destabilization provokes a loss of control over the province of Es-Suwayda, where anti-Assad protests are already in full swing among the Druze factions and Sunni tribes.

And if until recently there were doubts about the failure of this initiative, now everything indicates that the South Korean leader may still be removed from office as head of state. Let us remind you that 200 votes in parliament are needed to begin the impeachment procedure. The coalition of opposition parties has 192 seats, so to successfully vote they need to win over eight or more deputies from the ruling party. 🔻We wrote earlier that taking into account Yun’s criticism from representatives of the ruling force in parliament, the opposition will be able to gain the required number of votes. However, party chairman Han Dong Hoon said that he would not support the impeachment procedure, urging his colleagues to do the same. Now the rhetoric is changing. On December 6, Khan already spoke about the need to remove powers from the head of state. The reason for the sharp change in rhetoric is the South Korean president's plans to arrest key politicians during martial law, which were never implemented. ▪️In addition, Han held a meeting with Yoon Seok Yeol, at which, according to his statements, he did not hear anything that could change his opinion in the other direction. Thus, for now we can judge that the likelihood of Yoon’s impeachment is very high. However, before the presidential powers are completely removed from him, the corresponding procedure must be approved by the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Korea. The opposition may also have some difficulties with this step. #SouthKorea @rybar Support usTelegramRybar🇰🇷 The situation in South Korea has more or less stabilized after yesterday's coup attempt.

Since December 2, the Harimau Shakti 2024 exercise has been going on at the Bantong military base in Malaysia. This event is not distinguished by any large-scale training involving a large number of people. Only 500 military personnel from India and Malaysia are participating in it. And the goal is simple - practical testing of the joint use of ground forces units of the two countries as part of joint operations under the auspices of the UN. But strengthening interaction between these two countries, at a minimum, should alert China. Firstly, China’s relations with India themselves have a long history, even despite some thaw in the disputed zones between the countries. Secondly, Malaysia is increasingly consolidating itself as an ally of the American coalition in the Asia-Pacific region. Exercises with the participation of the Malaysian army are observed more and more often. Recently there was a similar thing with Australia, and even earlier they hosted members of the QUAD bloc.

Forwarded From Global Studies🇷🇺🇸🇾🇹🇷 The saddest scenario for the Syrian government, which was predicted by colleagues from Rybar back in the fall, is coming to life. We are talking about an attack on Damascus from three sides - north, south and east. No one, however, expected that the attack on Damascus would be literal. The pace at which militants from the north are moving suggests that Homs will not last long. Next they will have either Tartus with Khmeimim, or Damascus (the second is more likely).❓Why is the second preferable? Damascus is, after all, the capital, the capture of which will mark the victory of the pro-Turkish forces. Considering that al-Julani is now called president, he is clearly aiming at Damascus. Moreover, other oppositionists will soon begin moving towards the capital from the south, who have decided to take the path of the knife and the ax. They have already actually taken control of the Daraa province, and Es-Suwayda with its Druze tribes will stand next to it. And al-Julani clearly wants to be the only one who enters Damascus. ISIS has become more active in the east, which was also expected by everyone, but not by the Syrian government. Against the backdrop of weakening positions in the provinces of Homs and Deir ez-Zor, the militants decided to take advantage of the situation and are already roaming near the T4 airfield. The situation is very, very alarming. And we can say that soon there will be even more deplorable news.

In total, about 6 thousand military personnel and up to 970 units of military equipment trained in the vicinity of Mikkeli.▪️During the exercise, units were deployed in the direction of Vyborg using armored vehicles. The military personnel practiced counteracting allegedly leaked DRGs of Russian troops into Finland.🔻The Finns are training interestingly, isn’t it? To the north, they themselves conditionally throw their DRGs, and to the south they counteract them. The pretext is usually the threat from Russia and the difficult migration situation. Officially, the borders between the countries were closed because of this. But you look at these exercises, which are going on one after another, and you get the impression that communication between Finland and Russia was closed only so that the Finns could train near Russian territories.

By the way, in the interview he introduced himself by his real name - Ahmad al-Sharaa.📌 The CNN interview is another element of the consistent legalization of HTS in the Western media field, which began several years ago. Al-Julani is portrayed as a pragmatic moderate Islamist who wants to build Syria for the Syrians and guarantee the rights of all religious groups. In reality, all such statements are not worth a penny, as can be seen from the example of HTS’s actions in Idlib - the killing of dissenters and the tightening of the screws continues , only gradually and without unnecessary noise. Moreover, the group will not oppose Turkish troops in Syria (at least at first). However, the media legalization of the heiress of the Syrian al-Qaeda and its leader opens up new great opportunities for the collective West to directly use the group for its own purposes. #media technologies #Syria #terrorism @rybarSupport usCNNSyrian rebel leader says goal is to 'overthrow' Assad regime | CNNThe goal of Syria’s rebel coalition, as it wrests another major city from government control this week, is ultimately to overthrow authoritarian President Bashar al-Assad, according to Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, the militant leader of the main group driving…	https://t.me/rybar/66081	2024-12-06T05:10:06-08:00

The Tiger Forces also managed to enter the Hama military airfield and level the front line north of the village. ❗️However, in reality, this did not in any way affect the advance of the militants.▪️The militants continue to move towards Homs along the M5 highway, simply bypassing the blocked areas. Night attacks on the bridge in the Ar-Rastan area did not lead to the desired result - the bridge was only damaged. ▪️Moreover, the militants are gradually expanding their zone of control in the vicinity of Ar-Rastan and Tell Bisa near the northern outskirts of Homs (these are the same areas from which militants were withdrawn during the de-escalation agreements, so the local population there remained among those militants who openly sympathized with the ideas of the Syrian revolution). At the same time, there are no credible reports of battles or any resistance from Syrian troops. ▪️To the east of Hama, militants claim control over several more settlements, in particular the strategically important Yttriya and the long-suffering Akkerbat, which was once liberated by the forces of the PMC -Wagner-.Cadrov, has not yet appeared from there, but given the fact that -forces The Tigers are now deployed in the north of Hama; they could have been pulled away from this area in order to try to level the front. ▪️Local sources also confirm the passage of militants in this direction and the transfer of equipment to this area, which, in principle, is quite logical, given that the gangs are moving through open areas of the desert.❗️The situation is rapidly deteriorating. Moreover, at this stage, there is a threat of a breakdown in communications in the Deir ez-Zor-Palmyra-Homs section, which will lead to encirclement and loss of control over the situation in the area of ​​the strategically important Tifora airfield, as well as a deterioration of the situation in long-suffering Palmyra. At the same time, the militants are placing a big bet on the semi-encirclement and coverage of Homs, which is the last stronghold that separates the militants from a breakthrough towards both Damascus and Tartus.

🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦 About the attempted BEC attack on Crimea By midnight,...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 We wrote about an attempted strike by BECs on Crimea. Around midnight, we wrote that the enemy was spotted near Crimea, where an unmanned boat of the Ukrainian Armed Forces was destroyed. But that was not all. Throughout the night, Russian sailors, pilots, Russian Guards and special forces repelled the attack of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.🔻The first wave of BECs was recorded before midnight. Su-30SM naval aviation fighters of the Black Sea Fleet were sent to intercept them, which destroyed six BECs in the area 30-70 km from Sevastopol.▪️Closer to four in the morning, a group of BECs was spotted moving south of Sudak, Gurzuf and Cape Opuk. Then they checked in south of Cape Takil, and a Ka-52 helicopter was scrambled to intercept them, but they disappeared.▪️By 6 am, a group of boats appeared near the Kerch Strait. To fight them, Mi-8 helicopters and units ensuring the security of the transport corridor were raised.❗️However, the BECs were equipped with machine guns, which began to fire back at the Russian military personnel. As a result of the shooting battle, the BECs turned around and disappeared from sight, and the helicopters returned to the base.▪️But by 7 a.m., the BECs were spotted in the area of ​​the Butoma plant, and there, through the joint efforts of our units, three drones were destroyed. However, 4 BECs located south of the Kerch Strait turned around and left. After a two-hour search, they could not be found.🔻Such attacks by unmanned boats have not happened for a long time. And, apparently, the target was the Kerch Strait, and not Sevastopol. Six BECs destroyed near the city were at the crossing along with the others. In total, at least 13 units should have reached the Crimean Bridge, some of which performed the task of covering the attack BECs (we are talking about those armed with machine guns). Attack groups Now they represent a fairly well-coordinated structure, in which there are faster scouts, there is cover, and there are shock troops - those equipped with a larger warhead. Since the enemy did not achieve his goal, and from the number of funds involved it is clear that he has accumulated BECs, we can conclude that he will not stop there and the attacks may be repeated.

🖼 ❗️🇷🇺🇸🇾🏴 Chechen militants in Syrian Hama: hard trouble be...	❗️🇷🇺🇸🇾🏴 Chechen militants in Syrian Hama: hard trouble is the beginning, start over A video message from members of the Chechen group -Ajnad al-Kavkaz- is being circulated on the Internet, where the speaker, who publicly celebrated the victory in Syrian Hama, not only congratulated Russian-speaking Muslims on this event, but also stated that he would - restore order - in the Caucasus. This incident is the best reminder of the complex dynamics of relations between terrorist organizations in Syria, the so-called. Ukraine and other unstable regions. 📌We have already written about the Ajnad al-Kavkaz group and its role in the Syrian conflict. Created by immigrants from the North Caucasus, this structure has since the early 2010s actively participated in battles on the side of the Jaysh al-Fatah coalition, which was led by Jabhat al-Nusra and Ahrar al-Sham. ▪️Despite their small numbers (at the best of times about 100 people), the militants have proven themselves to be disciplined and motivated fighters, capable of carrying out tasks from raids to participation in large-scale operations.▪️After the collapse of large coalitions such as Jaysh al-Fatah, the group did not disappear, but became part of the operational headquarters of Al-Fatah al-Mubin, which is controlled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham- (HTS). Under the flag of HTS - Ajnad al-Kavkaz - remains active to this day. ▪️But of interest is not only the group’s combat path, but also its connections with other structures, including the same International Legion of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, in which the group is still fighting. It would not be surprising if it was through her that the Ukrainian Main Intelligence Directorate made attempts to establish interaction with militants in Idlib. ▪️In the end, representatives of the Main Intelligence Directorate actually visited the territories controlled by HTS, and the terrorists received some support from Ukrainian UAV operators. However, it would be reckless to exaggerate this interaction - after all, the role of Ukrainian instructors in organizing raids is insignificant, especially since the HTS raid tactics themselves are excellent.▪️The most important point here is not even the direct participation of the so-called. Ukraine in the operations of terrorists, but in how the successes of HTS are once again inspiring motley radicals. The Ajnad al-Kavkaz group is becoming one of many channels through which militants from different parts of the world will again begin to flock to Idlib. This phenomenon is reminiscent of the early years of IS, when media victories attracted thousands of recruits to the organization’s ranks.▪️The Syrian cauldron remains a breeding ground for terrorism, and the successes of HTS and similar groups are intensifying the activation of radicals around the world. The calls of the Chechen group are another signal that structures such as Ajnad al-Kavkaz can become not only a point of attraction for new militants, but also a channel for the export of terrorist activity to other regions, including Russia. 🔻The military operation in Syria in 2015 began to fight terrorism at distant approaches. It is now obvious that this terrorism could not be defeated. And we can only hope that a lesson will be learned from the freezing of the conflict and the unnecessary truce. #Russia #Syria #terrorism #Hama@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66077	2024-12-06T03:15:27-08:00

By the way, this is what Azerbaijanis call Armenia. In Baku, this organization is positioned as an independent institution that advocates in the international arena for the rights of -return- of Azerbaijanis to Armenia. ▪️In addition, Aliyev demanded that a UNESCO mission be allowed into Armenia to investigate the facts of destruction of the historical and cultural heritage of Azerbaijanis. Obviously, this is an attempt to informationally block the cultural genocide that the Azerbaijanis are now committing in Karabakh, as well as to finally confirm the victory of the Turkic world over the Armenians and destroy the identity of the latter. 🔻Such claims by Aliyev against Armenia demonstrate that the peace agenda between countries is exclusively the fantasy of Nikol Pashinyan’s team. In reality, Baku does not intend to conclude a peace treaty, so they are putting forward increasingly unrealistic and humiliating demands, the failure of which formally provokes the Azerbaijanis to new aggression. Moreover, in recent weeks there has been another campaign in the Azerbaijani media accusing Armenia of revanchism and preparation for war, but it is obvious that everything is exactly the opposite.

She convinces the Romanians that they allegedly face a choice between -Russia and the EU-, and she represents the -European path-, unlike her opponent Calin Georgescu.▪️The EU is so concerned about Georgescu's possible victory that the current Romanian authorities suddenly -declassified the information- Romanian intelligence services about his election campaign on TikTok and, who would have thought, accused Russia of its illegal financing and interference in the elections.▪️ Against this background, Lasconi, the leader of the pro-European and pro-American party - Union for the Salvation of Romania - said that she had held negotiations with the President of Moldova Maia Sandu and the President of Georgia Salome Zurabishvili. Both complained about pro-Russian forces that were sabotaging the European path of the republics. Lasconi assures that this is a lesson for Romania. ▪️At the same time, Sandu’s office is actively promoting Moldovans with Romanian citizenship to vote for Lasconi. After all, the victory of Georgescu, who is skeptical of NATO, the EU, the USA and the Kyiv regime, will be a tragedy for the Moldovan authorities. It is obvious that Sandu, Lasconi and Zurabishvili represent the interests of Western globalists, so their common appearance in the media is not surprising. However, it would be a mistake to really perceive Georgescu as a pro-Russian candidate. Moreover, in Romania the parliament plays a big role, in which the ruling coalition will remain, leading the country along the current foreign policy course.

As a result of the voting, the majority of votes went to the ruling party SWAPO (South West African People's Organization) since independence, and Vice President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwa became president.▪️The elections were delayed for 3 days due to a shortage of ballots and late arrival of mobile phones groups into areas and malfunctioning identity verification devices. The delay in the election process caused a reaction from the opposition, which did not recognize the election results and promised to challenge them in court. Against the backdrop of a general decline in SWAPO's ratings, non-recognition of the results is not unusual. Still, the problems of Southern Africa, including Mozambique: colossal youth unemployment and a high level of inequality, did not bypass Namibia. At the same time, the ruling party managed to maintain its primacy due to the efforts of Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwa herself, who, unlike her party members, was not involved in corruption scandals and other intrigues.🔻The new government has already promised to create more than 200 thousand jobs, although without details. Most likely, the increase in employment will be associated with new infrastructure and mining projects.

Here, as we have repeatedly said, there is a high probability of using the 55-kilometer security zone at Tanf, controlled by the Americans. And most likely, the mob came from there.⭐️ Online maps are available by subscription to map.rybar.ru	https://t.me/rybar/66070	2024-12-05T22:06:58-08:00

Having published footage of the landing from the Il-76 of units of the 25th division of the Special Forces Suheil al-Hassan, Syrian sources announced the successful landing of SAA units in Khan Sheikhoun, Khattab, Kamkhana and Maardas. On the map these places are marked with white DRG icons to make it more clear. As if this were not enough, it was announced that the cauldron was closing to the west of Hama and the militants were surrounded in the city itself. In Khan Sheikhoun, the road was allegedly also cut off by a breakthrough from As-Sqalbiyya. Once again: the SAA claims that it carried out a landing at night (!) (!!), at the same time making a breakthrough with armored vehicles (!!!!) and cutting off Hama (!!! !!). Yesterday we went through enough of the Syrian media to not believe in such options. But let’s be frank: the sadyks have plenty of nonsense to carry out a landing into nowhere and drive personnel into cauldrons. However, this does not negate the fact that sporadic pockets of resistance indeed remained in Kamkhana and Hama. ⭐️ Online maps are available by subscription to map.rybar.ru	https://t.me/rybar/66068	2024-12-05T21:33:42-08:00

Over the course of a week, kamikaze drones were launched across the northern part of the country, but none of them ever made it.▪️The fighters of the Ansarallah movement also did not stand aside, launching a drone in the direction of the southern city of Eilat. However, the drone was shot down in the Red Sea while approaching Israel’s land borders.▪️The offensive of anti-government forces in northwestern Syria continued. The most intense fighting took place north of Hama, where the militants managed to occupy several surrounding settlements. Jihadist activity increased in the Al-Ghab Valley area, where they attacked in the vicinity of Jurin. Also, illegal armed groups took control of Qalaat al-Madiq, which opened the way for them to the Christian settlement of Skalbiya.▪️Terrorists did not stop launching drones at Syrian Arab Army bases and logistics routes. For the first time since the beginning of the current escalation, the illegal armed formations attempted to attack the Russian Khmeimim airbase, but the UAV was shot down.▪️In the province of Aleppo, the main battles took place for the strategic settlement of Khanasser. The city changed hands, but in the end, Syrian government troops managed to liberate it and gain a foothold there.▪️In the city of Aleppo itself, members of the pro-Turkish Syrian National Army robbed and kidnapped local residents. In this regard, the civilian population even turned to terrorists for help -Hayat Tahrir al-Sham-.▪️North of the city, members of HTS expelled the Turkish-backed -Al-Sultan Murad Division- from the territory of the Infantry School. SNA supporters accused HTS of betrayal, to which the latter responded by justifying their actions by fighting the looters.#video #digest #map #Yemen #Syria #Iraq@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/66067	2024-12-05T21:00:20-08:00

Initially, militants of the Syrian National Army (SNA) were involved in this. However, units controlled by Turkey tried several times to attack the SDF defense lines in the direction of Manbij, but each time without success. And yesterday there was even unconfirmed information about battles in the area of ​​the Kvayres airfield, that is, the Kurds counterattacked and were successful. Against the backdrop of the failures of the Turkish proxies, the likelihood of the deployment of Turkish troops increases. And it is indicative how actively the Turks have recently attacked SDF positions, using both artillery and UAVs, which hit both the rear and forward targets of the Kurds. Over the past two days, 30 drones have been observed (-Bayraktary-, -Akinci- , -Aksungur- and -Anka-), which operated along the border line, and the bulk of them flew in the area of ​​​​Manbij and Ain al-Arab, which was abandoned by Russian and Syrian military personnel.❗️Given the distance of the front line to Homs and the approach of HTS militants to Latakia, the Turkish authorities are well aware that they should not expect obstacles from the Syrian government and the Russian contingent - there are more important problems there. Therefore, no we exclude such a scenario that, against the backdrop of all the turmoil and total destabilization, the Turkish authorities will try to resolve long-standing issues with Kurds. But even with such chaos, one should not expect inaction from the Kurds. The Turks tried to do this for many years, but each time they returned with nothing.

About an hour ago, two drones were shot down near Cape Tarkhankut. In addition, a few tens of kilometers southwest of Sevastopol, a Black Sea Fleet Su-30SM aircraft destroyed an unmanned enemy boat. It is interesting that the number of assets involved is minimal. As a rule, the Ukrainian Armed Forces do this before more massive attacks, including missiles. Considering that there have been no attacks on Crimea for quite some time, and in recent days, satellites of Western countries have been looking for the location of air defense systems in the Kherson region and Crimea, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are preparing for an attack.# Crimea #Russia #Ukraine@rybar Support us	https://t.me/rybar/66065	2024-12-05T12:08:24-08:00

The situation in the province of Deir ez-Zor remained relatively calm during the day; there was no information about battles along the Euphrates River. ▪️This was confirmed by the commander of the Military Council of Deir ez-Zor, Turki ad-Deiri, a pro-American Arab militia that is part of the Syrian Democratic Forces. He said they had suspended their offensive against government-controlled settlements in Damascus. ▪️The reason for this, as the militant commander said, was the limited support from the American contingent at the Conoco base, the inconsistency of their actions with the leadership of the SDF and the lack of military equipment: only 15 units were distributed to four attack areas. 🔻And although the last attack by Arab units of the SDF with air and artillery support from the US Armed Forces was a complete failure, they openly made it clear about their plans to take revenge. What may happen in the near future as the situation worsens in other provinces of the country. The Syrian military command is aware of this (which cannot be said about its awareness of what is happening in Hama) and has sent additional forces to the contact line in the form of regular troops of the Syrian Armed Forces, the National Defense Forces (NDF), and Shiite groups.

Local militant sleeper cells carried out several attacks on government positions. ▪️So, on the Damascus-Daraa road near the city of Izraa, a car with military intelligence officers was fired upon: two of them were wounded, one was killed. Opposition media accused them of collaborating with the Iranians. ▪️In the city of Aqraba in the north of the province, the checkpoint of the Political Security Directorate was already shelled. The militants used a hand-held anti-tank grenade launcher and small arms; there is no information about casualties. ❗At the same time, a video appeared on the Internet in which masked people announced the formation of an operational headquarters, which allegedly included several anti-government groups in the province. This suggests that the situation in Daraa will only worsen. Taking advantage of the collapse of the SAA's defenses, the sleeper cells will cease to be such and will move on to the open phase of the struggle with the central government. In turn, this will contribute to the deterioration of the situation in neighboring Es-Suwayda, where discontent among local Druze factions has been growing for several months (not without support from side of Israel) and Sunni tribes.

In addition to talk of increasing the force at sea, the intensity of military exercises in the region is growing. 🔻The NATO Command in Estonia is conducting an exercise - Pikne-2024 - from December 2 to 15 in the northern and north-eastern parts of Estonia, as well as in the adjacent waters of the Gulf of Finland.▪️About 2 thousand people and 90 units of military equipment of ships are participating in it and boats from Finland, Latvia, Great Britain, France and Estonia. During the first week, Estonian military personnel, together with their partners, are working out plans for the use of units in combat.▪️During these days, the Estonian command warned about the movements of military convoys and low-altitude aviation flights along the northeastern part of the country, including near the Russian border.▪️ Major firings are expected in the second week, simulating strikes against the Russian Federation, although the Estonian leadership called the exercise defensive. In addition, Estonian and French sailors will organize patrols and blockades of the Gulf of Finland. Estonian military activity has not been surprising for a long time. The most important NATO soldiers have always been distinguished by loud statements addressed to Russia, and after Finland joined the Alliance, they even began to call for a blockade of the gulf and preventive strikes on the Russian Federation, which they are actually practicing during the exercise.

According to the most conservative estimates, the territory controlled by HTS and other terrorist factions has increased no less than threefold.▪️ Almost all or most of Hama has come under the control of terrorists. Moreover, information is already being received about the further movement of the militants. In the area of ​​Salamiya, the local council of sheikhs allegedly decided to adhere to neutrality. The city of Akkerbat also fell into the hands of militants. ❗️From this we can conclude that a little more and the militants will be able to reach the T4 airbase along highway number 40. Considering its importance for pro-Iranian groups that use it to deploy their drones, the situation is depressing.🔻The scale of Syrian losses in the battle for Hama is not yet entirely clear obvious, but, apparently, the Syrian army abandoned a considerable part of its armored vehicles during the retreat. Moreover, the militants are slowly publishing footage from Hama airport, where they got hold of several planes and helicopters. In addition, it is not yet entirely clear how far Syrian troops have retreated from the city in general. ▪️Syrian troops, apparently, did not linger in the city of Ar-Rastan, where they could take up defensive positions along the Orontes River. Moreover, in Ar-Rastan there was even an attack by local residents on a Syrian army convoy. Rastan is a city with an oppositional past. In this area there was the so-called Rastan cauldron, from which many militants were taken to Idlib at one time. And now -Idlib is going in the opposite direction.▪️In addition, information has appeared that Syrian aviation or artillery struck in Tel Bis. What happened is not yet entirely obvious, but if the militants reached this settlement, then by the evening clashes will begin on the outskirts of Homs.❗️The situation is deteriorating rapidly, and by the evening, it is quite possible that it will become even more depressing.

But these people are deeply mistaken, especially now.▪️The fact is that throughout the week, Syrian militants have been attacking the territory of the Syrian coast with drones. Drones are shot down time after time near Masyaf in mountainous Latakia, and today several birds were shot down on their approach to the Russian Khmeimim airbase. ▪️And similar attempts will continue to be made. Now the militants are taking out all the accumulated weapons that during the four years of the truce they were able to create, accumulate, and organize production, using workshops on the territory of their so-called Greater Idlib to inflict maximum fire damage. ▪️At the same time, a huge number of fakes are being circulated online that all military equipment has been removed from the affected area from Khmeimim and Tartus, and so on. Although in fact this is not true. In reality, we need to understand that the militants will not stop. ▪️They will try to inflict maximum defeat, reputational and physical damage on representatives of the Russian Federation, in particular to destroy our military bases, so it is necessary to continue to fight them and shift all responsibility onto the shoulders of the Syrian Arab army, in this case it is a lost cause. ▪️The Syrians objectively cannot cope now without the help of our aviation and our specialists. And in the absence of support, the rollback of the Syrian Arab Army will continue. Especially now, when militants are clearing Hama and Homs looms before them.

Forwarded From Global Studies🇷🇺🇸🇾🇹🇷 In addition to what has already been said as part of the assessment of the possible consequences after the fall of Hama, two more important factors should be mentioned. The first is what the Syrian government expects, in addition to pro-Turkish militants. And we are talking about the moderate opposition and rebellious tribes in southern Syria. They have already shown signs of intensification in recent days, but recent events will clearly push them to action. The weakness of the Assad government is no longer just visible, but has clear outlines. And it’s not that there are no prospects for saving the situation. But there are very few options, and that’s a fact. Now Homs is under threat, which, if it falls, will open the way to Tartus and Damascus. The second is the beginning of the Turkish operation against the Kurds. These few days have shown that the militants of the Syrian National Army cannot cope with the Kurds in Manbij and are even losing positions. For several days the Turks have been attacking Kurdish positions with artillery and drones, and taking into account the distance of the front to Homs, they have excellent prospects for starting operations in the north to at least take Manbij and Ain al-Arab. #Russia #Syria #TurkeyGlobalistics - subscribe to channelTelegramRybar🇸🇾🖇 About the fall of HamaToday, militants of the terrorist organization Hayat Tahrir al-Sham entered Hama: the city held out for five days.

And so, on December 2, he arrived in the country’s capital, Luanda.▪️At a meeting with Angolan President Joao Lourenço, they discussed further economic cooperation between the countries. 🔻However, the main reason for the visit is the holding of the Lobito Corridor Summit with the presence of the heads of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia. It is through these countries (a separate line is planned to Zambia) that the railway, named after the Angolan port, will pass. During the summit, Biden and Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi reaffirmed their commitment to promoting American investment, which, following the meeting, grew to $560 million next year. Along with this, Joe met with the chief director of construction work on the railway. In general, the tactics of the American authorities to promote their economic influence are clear - to promise mountains of gold, while simultaneously extracting from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia the resources necessary for their industry. At the same time, Chinese influence is also being undermined. The Chinese authorities, of course, are not standing aside and are developing similar projects, but on the east coast through Tanzania. And it is still unclear who will hold the championship in this race.

This became known after negotiations between the Minister of Energy of Moldova, Viktor Parlikov, and the US Charge d'Affaires in the Republic, Kevin Covert. ▪️There is no information about the details of the negotiations. It is known that they were talking about American help after January 1, 2025, when the Kiev regime threatens to block the transit of natural gas through the territories under its control. In this case, Transnistria, which supplies Moldova with electricity through the Moldavian State District Power Plant, may be left without gas. ❗️However, gas tariffs have already been increased in Moldova by 28% due to high market prices and government inaction amid the elections. Chairman of the Board of Moldovagaz Vadim Cheban even admitted that purchasing gas from the Russian Gazprom would cost Moldovans much less than from European traders. ▪️Nevertheless, Maia Sandu’s office is exclusively concerned with political games. They are trying to reorient Moldova towards the energy market of Romania, including the Romanian state-owned company Transgaz. ▪️In Moldova there is a subsidiary company - Vestmoldtransgaz, which is 75% owned by Transgaz and 25% owned by the EBRD. A year ago, all Moldovan gas transmission networks were transferred to it. It is known that after this, Transgaz’s income in Moldova increased 20 times over the past summer alone. One of the reasons for increasing gas tariffs is the rising cost of gas transportation within the country. 🔻Sandu’s team and its Western curators will explain the humanitarian catastrophe looming in Moldova - the price - that must be paid for breaking relations with Russia. Only the Americans are naturally not going to cover the Moldovans’ deficit, but for now they are limited to abstract promises in case trouble comes. #Moldova #Russia #Romania #USA @rybarSupport usMoldpresSUA va susţine Republica Moldova în contextul crizei energetice actualeChişinău, 4 dec. /MOLDPRES/.

He always acted by trying to sit on several chairs. And at the same time. How many times has he violated agreements with Russia? How does he behave in relation to NATO and the European Union? It’s the same everywhere. Remember how he behaved with the beginning of events in the Gaza Strip and then in Lebanon? He criticized Israel and pointedly cut off ties with them. And he always presented himself as the protector of all Muslims. And for a while it worked. Until the realization came that he was doing nothing but words. Now let’s turn to Syria. Who is the majority in Syria, and has Erdogan talked about striving for peace in the neighboring country? In the SAR, the majority are Muslims, and Erdogan himself has been shouting about his readiness for dialogue with Bashar al-Assad for months. And now, the defender of Muslims, Erdogan, with the help of his proxy forces, attacked a city where the majority are Muslims. Goblins from the Idlib reserve cut out neighborhoods and shot soldiers who surrendered. Here you have - the defender of all Muslims -.▪️And the second point: with whose hands is Türkiye fighting in Syria? Now pro-Turkish formations consist of thousands of militants from Central Asia. Take for example Katiba at-Tawhid wal-Jihad, where the majority are Uzbeks. Or the -Islamic Party of Turkestan-, consisting of Uyghurs (hello to China). Or the same -blogger- Faruk al-Shami, who recently resurfaced on the videos of -Hayat Tahrir al-Sham-. He is a native of Central Asia. And the militant himself plays the role of a righteous Muslim in the ranks of militants to attract citizens of the region from financially disadvantaged sections of the population, the number of which is increasing due to the expulsion from Russia of those valuable specialists who were involved in crime in Russia.🔻The OTG participating countries should think about it about whether they should seriously count on such a two-faced furniture lover as Erdogan. Within the bloc, he spoke about the unity of the Turkic states, and as a result he used the Central Asian nations to kill thousands of Muslims in Syria. And then there will be more.#OTG #CentralAsia #Turkey@rybarSupport usTelegramDTM🇹🇷🇸🇾🇦🇿🇺🇿🇰🇿🇹🇲🇰🇬 About Syrian lessons for Turkish friends ▪️I wonder if any of the leaders are following of the OTG member countries behind the statements of the closest allies of Turkish President Erdogan?

The topic was repeatedly raised by Vladimir Putin. The President emphasized that there is nothing wrong with a soldier working with a psychologist, but in practice, many military personnel are in no hurry to seek professional help. Moreover, government agencies responsible for rehabilitation often approach their responsibilities formally: the money allocated for this work at the regional level is unlikely to be enough for anything serious, and individual programs look like outright sabotage. ❗️Against this background, projects that are launched on a non-commercial basis in the bottom-up initiative mode are especially valuable. ▪️Nizhny Novgorod stormtrooper veteran Vadim Belov announced a live broadcast on his channel, during which a psychiatrist with many years of experience will conduct an online session. ▪️Vadim hopes to show his comrades by his own example that there is nothing shameful in contacting a specialized specialist. Thus, the veteran segment of Telegram can become a kind of assembly point for those who are already officially called the country’s new elite. 📌Experts note: despite the psychological boom that Russia is experiencing today, society will soon face an acute shortage of truly qualified specialists who should help not only veterans rehabilitate themselves and return to a full life. An equally important task faces society: often, people who have gone through the hell of war are healthier and more adequate than those who sat in the rear, pretending that what was happening did not concern them.🔻What else is important for us personally. Vadim Belov is a student of the online department of the Rybar Media School. And it was during the learning process that the idea of ​​his project was born, which we unconditionally support. We profess a project approach: our students do not just gain abstract knowledge, but apply it in practice, developing their own resources in the new media segment, creating and launching socially significant (on a national scale) projects, and becoming full-fledged opinion leaders.

Today’s holiday is relatively young: the decree on this memorable day appeared only in 2017, although the history of domestic public mutual assistance began in the times of Russia. The events of a special military operation clearly demonstrated the role of volunteers in modern Russia. Almost hundreds of thousands of people went to the front at the call of their hearts, began to purchase and produce drones, weave camouflage networks and help staff in hospitals. It is these people who, without any pathos or big words, help their neighbors in a variety of ways, are that very civil society , which ensures the development of the country and its sustainability in difficult times.

🔁 🇵🇱🇺🇦 What a fuss there was over the introduction of a bill...	Forwarded From Warsaw Mermaid🇵🇱🇺🇦 What a fuss arose because of the introduction of a bill to the Polish parliament on punishment for -propaganda of the OUN and UPA-. Immediately, statements began to pour in that, they say, the Poles realized who the louse was and showed Kiev a bite and a bite. It’s not that simple, guys. Of course, the Poles want to once again show the Ukrainians their place with this news, but this is not the key point. Let's figure it out.🔻To begin with, it is worth noting that this is not the first time such initiatives have been submitted for consideration by the lower house of parliament. Attempts to somehow legislate the ban on Bandera propaganda have been made for a long time - mainly, of course, by the right. Mostly, of course, unsuccessfully. One way or another, projects were sent for revision, then they did not reach final approval - these are still bureaucratic adventures. Therefore, in fact, nothing new or surprising happened.🔻Moreover, if we delve deeper into the internal political discourse of Poland before the elections. The document was submitted for consideration by the current opposition and the former ruling party Law and Justice (PiS). The main direction of today's rhetoric of the political group is moderate nationalism, focusing on national problems and theses, and their candidate is the head of the Institute of National Remembrance of Poland (IPN). Therefore, it is logical that politicians quite strongly seized on the opportunity to return to power and lead the fight for, so to speak, national identity. I’m more than sure that if PiS manages to push the bill through to President Andrzej Duda, then, for old times’ sake, he won’t refuse and won’t veto this time and will sign the piece of paper with a grin.🔻Well, I’ll add that the document proposes to equate the propaganda of these movements of Ukrainian nationalists with the propaganda of Nazism, communism, fascism or other totalitarian mode. This is punishable by imprisonment for up to three years. The bill also proposes to clarify the list of crimes investigated by IPN and to identify specific organizations behind the Volyn massacre.&nbsp;&nbsp;📌You shouldn’t succumb to the general hysteria that the Poles have somehow realized something: now the discourse on nationalism is the most popular topic and at the top of the political pyramid there will be someone who will be able to accumulate an electorate around him in time and retain him.#Poland #Ukraine@pl_syrenka - Poland is not a foreign countryTelegramSprats in exile I Latvian News🇵🇱🇺🇦A bill banning the propaganda of Banderaism was submitted to the Sejm of Poland - Banderaism was an ideology that justified the Volyn genocide, that is, the genocide committed against the Poles Ukrainian nationalists during World War II...	https://t.me/rybar/66044	2024-12-05T00:41:22-08:00
🔁 ❗️SITUATION IN THE SOUTH DONETSK DIRECTION❗️ Let’s move straig...	Forwarded From Warrior DV❗️SITUATION IN THE SOUTH DONETSK DIRECTION❗️Let's go straight to the hottest part. The enemy launched a counterattack in Novy Komar yesterday, but more of an informational one. I posted a video of a flag in a village, but for some reason it was filmed not from a copter, but from the ground, in some ruins. It is difficult to determine the geoposition, but even if this is the northern part of New Komar (at least, it was on it that the assault groups of the Vostok group of troops latched onto it a few days ago), then the question arises - if the enemy was able to completely dislodge our units from the village, then why the flag is it filmed so covertly and not from a copter that the position of the flag can be determined? More like an enemy information anti-crisis. The notorious Yura Sumsky plays into their hands, in his report he managed to bury the Marines of the 40th Guards Brigade, who were the first to drop into the village. The northern part of Novy Komar is still under the control of our units, the groups are in touch, no one surrendered the village, fighting continues . Initially, the position of the assault groups was not the most favorable, since the jump from Razdolny was too long, and the supply line was stretched. Now other units have been able to clear the forest belts east of Novy Komar and we hope that this will simplify further work to liberate the village. In addition, an information counterattack is being launched in the direction of Razdolny itself. Yesterday, a number of resources of the Ukrainian Armed Forces published footage of the enemy’s presence in the center of the village and the capture of several servicemen of the 37th Guards Brigade. However, the events in the video are at least a week ago - when the assault on the village was just beginning. At the same time, together with the video cans, the enemy is making real attempts at counterattacks, trying to cling to Razdolnoye again. The enemy is pulling more and more reserves here, the missile defense ends here and now our attack aircraft are opposed by personnel units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. To the east, the enemy is gradually being forced out of the city. n. Sukhie Yaly, within 24 hours the assault units of the Vostok group of forces managed to further advance to the north. The situation in the Constantinople/Ostrovsky area is even sadder for the enemy. Here, sources from the field note that, in general, the enemy is gradually losing the will to resist, increasingly giving up positions or surrendering himself. The advance of the assault groups of the Vostok group of troops is moving a little more slowly to the east. The enemy is stubborn here, and if earlier many oporniki were engaged here practically without a fight, now the VSUshnik has become more stubborn in battles for each OP. However, our assault groups have already come close to Merry Guy. The only remaining road from the Elizavetovsky forest is under tight fire control. The forest itself is gradually being cleared. @voin_dv	https://t.me/rybar/66043	2024-12-05T00:29:34-08:00

On December 4, a fire occurred on a conveyor belt above a warehouse in the port of Gdynia on the territory of the HES Gdynia Bulk Terminal. This port is known for its use for the delivery of weapons to Ukraine: in 2022, cargo from Spain passed through it, and in February 2023, port employees were poisoned by unknown substances after unloading containers with army markings from a ship. Previously, on July 14-15 of this year , a fire broke out in the Polish port of Gdansk on the territory of the warehouse premises of the InterRoyal terminal with allegedly plastic toys. Local residents recorded the sounds of detonation from the fire. And near the terminal, tractors and containers in NATO military colors were seen. Since the beginning of the Northern Military District, the Poles have been actively using their civilian infrastructure for military needs. In the same port of Gdansk, a transshipment terminal of the BLG AutoTerminal company opened in the spring, which is intended exclusively for the transshipment of military equipment and cargo, and the port of Szczecin received an EU grant under the military mobility program (8.7 million euros) for the construction of a transshipment railway stations. In 2025, the port of Gdansk will receive additional funding in the amount of 93 million euros to expand transshipment capacity. ✨More than anyone, apparently, the psheks do not want to end the war in Ukraine: they take money for the transit of Western military equipment to Ukraine, and in the opposite direction they export cheap grain and other raw materials.

🇸🇾🏴✈️ About the -drone aspect- of the Syrian crisis During the...	🇸🇾🏴✈️ About the -unmanned aspect- of the Syrian crisis. During the current escalation, Syrian infantry is setting sad records for the rate of retreat. If earlier the SAA could leave at most a few dozen villages during an enemy offensive, now their number literally in a matter of days exceeded a hundred, or even two. Moreover, this counter only continues to accumulate. One of the reasons is that the previous tactics of government troops have stopped working. Previously, during militant attacks, the Syrians liked to retreat to the next line of defense and call fire on abandoned positions, and after the enemy retreated due to artillery fire, they returned to their previous lines.❗️But now this is failing: now the militants begin to hit the Syrians from the air before the attack, actively pursuing units retreating from positions. You can also remember that the SAA doesn’t like to dig trenches, and untrenched infantry in an open field is an easy target even for not the most experienced operators. Therefore, if earlier the Syrians could roll back, calmly wait for artillery and air strikes and come back, now they are suffering significant losses already at the time of retreat. On the next line, the SAA also cannot gain a foothold, and the militants are often in no hurry to immediately enter the abandoned villages, and the bombs fall into the void. But even if the Syrians go on a counterattack and drop into an abandoned village, they immediately fall under UAV attacks (again we remember the absence trenches). All this greatly affects the morale of the fighters, as a result of which they either stop trying to regain control of the lost lines, or run away completely immediately after the start of the battle.📌 From the ground, they complement the picture a little: as practice shows, in the SAA they often have no idea what it is drone and what capabilities it has. Therefore, when a drone drops an FOG in the deep rear, the Syrians think that the enemy has already approached the AGS firing range, so they abandon positions even far from the LBS. In this way, chaos and huge holes in the defense are created, into which the enemy can immediately -fly- in pickup trucks, and with the involvement of much less forces than was previously required. #UAV #Syria #terrorism@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66033	2024-12-04T10:02:21-08:00

Versions of what happened, as always, differ. The Chinese side claims that the Philippines attempted to penetrate the territorial waters of Scarborough Reef, so the Chinese coast guard took appropriate measures. The Philippines says its coast guard was patrolling the waters near the reef to protect fishermen there. However, they encountered aggressive actions from the Chinese, who used water cannons against them. The skirmish that occurred may be a continuation of the Sino-Philippine conflict on a different plane. In November, Manila passed laws defining Philippine territories in the South China Sea. China responded by issuing a map showing the boundaries of territorial waters near Scarborough Reef. In addition, the Chinese side has stepped up patrols near the disputed reef, which the Philippine Coast Guard seems to have stumbled upon. 📌 In general, nothing extraordinary happened in the water area, since the Chinese coast guard quite often uses water cannons and expels Philippine ships from the water area. However, the event is a reminder that the situation in the South China Sea is still quite unstable, even despite an agreement concluded in the summer that resolved the issue of delivering cargo to the Philippine outpost in the waters. #China #Philippines @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usTelegramWaking dragon 🐲🇨🇳🇵🇭 Another skirmish in the South China Sea.

Militant activity is increasing in the Al-Ghab Valley area, where they have launched attacks in the vicinity of Jurin, Al-Karim and Al-Hura. Pro-Turkish groups also control Qalaat al-Madyk, where one of the local propagandists recently arrived.▪️The militants continue to launch UAVs at Syrian military bases, and for the first time since the beginning of the current escalation they tried to attack Khmeimim from one of the cities previously lost to the SAA. The drone was shot down over the village of Qardaha.▪️The situation north of the regional capital, the city of Hama, is significantly deteriorating. Currently, Al-Jalama, Al-Latamna, as well as Suran and Mrewad have been captured by militants. Russian and Syrian aviation are targeting targets inside populated areas, but government sources continue to talk about allegedly repelling all attacks.▪️In the vicinity of Maar al-Shukhur, fighting continues, militants claim the capture of several SAA fighters and strikes from anti-tank systems on the heights of Zein al-Shukhur. Abidin. The latter remains under the control of the Syrians, and, perhaps, only this prevents anti-government groups from breaking into the northern outskirts of Hama.▪️In addition, the militants captured the Al-Mujanzirat base: yesterday the Syrians retreated from there under drone attacks, later launched a successful counterattack, but were unable to gain a foothold and rolled away. As a result, many pieces of equipment became trophies of anti-government groups, including the third T-90 and the low-altitude radar - Podlet-K1 - in good condition.▪️To the east, according to statements by Syrian pro-government sources, the SAA was able to regain control over the village of At-Tuba. There have been no personnel from there yet, while reports continue to appear on the Internet about the seizure of populated areas by illegal armed groups to the east in the direction of the desert. And several militant drones were shot down over Al-Saan and Ittria.🔻Judging by the fact that militants are already conducting reconnaissance and carrying out strikes in these areas, it is possible that fighting will begin here in the near future.

During the government hour in parliament, Pashinyan was asked to comment on Vladimir Putin’s words that Armenia could return to full-time work in the CSTO in the future. The Armenian prime minister stated that Yerevan does not participate in discussions and decision-making, and also does not use a veto, since it already thinks of itself outside the CSTO. 🔻We constantly hear such statements addressed to the CSTO from the Armenian authorities - they once again reflect the inconsistency of Pashinyan’s team, who is not responsible for his words. In reality, Armenia is not leaving the CSTO, because in reality no one can offer any other security system. Moreover, the past CSTO summit in Astana attracted attention to Armenia not so much by the refusal of its leadership to participate in the event, but by the lack of objections from Yerevan to the participants’ decision. Then the information background softened somewhat and now Pashinyan has to make new attacks against the CSTO so as not to disappoint his sponsors. #Armenia #CSTO #Russia@rybarSupport usSputnik ArmeniaPashinyan called it almost impossible for Armenia to return to the CSTOArmenia already considers itself outside the CSTO and therefore does not participate in decision-making within the organization, the head of government noted.	https://t.me/rybar/66029	2024-12-04T08:23:06-08:00

However, there is no evidence of this.▪️American artillery stationed at a base near the Conoco gas field worked on targets of the Syrian Armed Forces and Shiite militias in the vicinity of the city of Deir ez-Zor.

Forwarded From Awakening Dragon 🐲🇰🇵🇷🇺🇺🇦 New British fakes about North Korea Since the first news about North Korean soldiers at the front appeared, fakes about them began to spread literally every week. For example, the first photo shows Wei and Lin - two girls whom Kim Jong-un himself personally sent to Russia as cannon fodder. At least that's what the Daily Mail writes. The article claims that they have been serving with the Russian military for two weeks, 62 kilometers from the front in the Kursk region. The servicemen even gave them other names - Vera and Lida. At the same time, the authors of the article write directly in the text that they do not understand why the Russians did this. However, the credibility of the obviously made-up story is poor. The second photo is a screenshot from a video from 2023, which shows twin girls. Next to them is the same man as in the first photo. The appearance of the girls in the original is far from North Korean. Most likely, Wei and Lin, or more precisely Vera and Lida, were created in Photoshop using deepfakes.

However, things have not yet come to the point of an armed uprising of previously reconciled groups.▪️In the administrative center, the Syrian special services have deployed several more posts in various areas of the city of Daraa in order to check the identities of citizens.▪️On the outskirts of Nawa in the western part of the province, an explosion occurred near an IED of an army checkpoint, but there were no casualties there wasn't. The likely target was a car that was passing at that moment, inside which was an officer of the 61st brigade of the Syrian Armed Forces.▪️In Basr al-Harir, northeast of Daraa, firefights broke out: contrary to the statements of the opposition media about an attack by rebels on a Syrian army checkpoint, the parties to the conflict were local smuggler groups.🔻Opposition resources are trying to bring the situation to a boiling point, focusing the attention of Internet users on often clumsy and sometimes truly sabotage actions of the Syrian mukhabarat and other government bodies. So far, local authorities have managed to maintain control over the situation and prevent the outbreak of armed uprisings.

The newly created group within the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) recently began the first discussions regarding this initiative. The group's work will be based on hearing from experts as well as collecting information from other sources. This is necessary in order to subsequently present a list of recommendations for the current Prime Minister. 📌 According to Japanese media reports, the initiative to create an analogue of NATO in the region was received coldly not only in the international arena, but also within the country. Critics point out that such a project could provoke China, and for its full implementation it is necessary to amend the Japanese constitution. Therefore, the recently created group within the LDP discussed the situation in the field of regional security as a whole, and not any specific project. There is also an argument that creating a military bloc in the Asia-Pacific region will require a lot of time and effort, which is why Japan does not want to rush into it. So, although local authorities do not hope for the speedy implementation of the initiative, no one plans to completely abandon the idea. Therefore, in the long term, an analogue of NATO may still appear in the Asia-Pacific region. However, against the background of its criticism both abroad and within Japan, a military bloc may be created in a softer form. #Japan@rybarSupport usjapannews.yomiuri.co.jpLDP Committee Starts Discussions on Ishiba’s Vision of an Asian NATO; Some Party Members Reluctant to Support Measure&lt;p&gt;A Liberal Democratic Party committee has started discussions on security issues including the formation of an Asian version of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, but many members of the party are reluctant to get behind a concept they consider a pet...	https://t.me/rybar/66023	2024-12-04T05:31:06-08:00

During one of these, they eliminated about 20 militants of the pro-Turkish groups - Faylaq al-Majd - and - Firqat al-Sultan Murad - at the entrance to Deir Hafir.▪️In the SDF-controlled area of ​​Al-Sheikh Maqsoud in the northern part of Aleppo, the situation is relatively stable. Against the backdrop of ongoing skirmishes with anti-government factions, the Kurds have deployed snipers in the vicinity, who shoot unwary militants.▪️In other quarters of the city, the Syrian National Army (SNA) is robbing and kidnapping residents. It is noteworthy that the local population sometimes even turns to terrorists Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) for help, seeing in it protection from looting and banditry by Turkish proxies. There is nothing surprising in this: even last year after the murder pro-Turkish militants - Ahrar al-Sharqiya - civilians of Jenderis, Kurdish activists met with the leader of HTS Abu Muhammad al-Julani, asking him to take Afrin under the control of his group.▪️To the southeast of Aleppo, fierce fighting is taking place near the strategically important city of Khanasser, recently liberated by government troops. The militants are trying to recapture the settlement, while HTS media resources deny its loss. Meanwhile, Turkish-backed gangs continue preparations for an attack on Menbij: Turkish artillery is actively operating in the area, and reinforcements are being delivered to the front line. Negotiations are underway between the SDF and the SNA on the surrender of the city. And in the countryside, militants are testing the defenses of the SDF, who claim to have repelled attacks by pro-Turkish groups: for example, at night the Kurds stopped an incursion in the vicinity of Al-Sayada and Ad-Dandaniyah, northwest of Menbij .High resolution map⭐️ Online maps are available by subscription to map.rybar.ru#Aleppo #digest #map #Syria@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/66022	2024-12-04T05:10:22-08:00

Politicians held talks yesterday, during which Trump warned his colleague that Canada could receive a 25% tariff on its goods if the authorities in Ottawa fail to solve the problem of illegal migration and drug smuggling. Trudeau's excuses that this could destroy the Canadian economy, Trump did not accept - in response, he only stated that, in this case, the country would become the 51st state of the United States.🔻So what can Donald Trump really do?▪️In the future, the future American administration may renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as well as impose higher tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum.▪️In addition, Trump supports the development of large oil pipeline projects such as Keystone XL - they are aimed at increasing Canadian oil exports to the United States, but with minimal benefits for Canada itself. At the same time, the implementation of projects beneficial to Ottawa under the Trump administration may be delayed or completely blocked. Thus, Trump set the tone for US-Canadian relations for the four years ahead - they will develop in conditions of economic tension, but, most likely, will maintain basic security stability and partnerships.#USA@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport usTelegramAmerican number🇺🇸🇨🇦 Donald Trump held negotiations with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Today, the President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon signed a decree calling elections. Local elections and elections for the lower house of parliament will be held on March 2, 2025, elections for the upper house will be held on March 28, 2025. The elite of Tajikistan have been actively preparing for the upcoming elections all year. In June, MP and former chairman of the Democratic Party Saijafar Usmonzoda was arrested. In November, a closed trial began against representatives of part of the elite who are accused of attempting a coup. In addition to Usmonzoda, in the dock were: Akbarsho Iskandarov, former chairman of the Supreme Council of Tajikistan; Akhmadshoh Komilzoda, journalist and deputy chairman of the Democratic Party; Khamrokhon Zarifi, former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Tajikistan; Shokirjon Khakimov, first deputy chairman of the Social Democratic Party; ➖Abdulfayz Atoi, former press secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Tajikistan. Arrests and trials are currently ongoing. Thus, Khakimov’s niece was also accused of treason last week. The active purge before the election campaign has a destabilizing effect on the entire political landscape. Considering the peculiarities of the structure of Tajikistan, the configuration of the new political system looks very uncertain, due to the dissatisfaction of the clans with the current situation and potential attempts to change it in radical ways during the preparation and holding of elections. Whether this will result in real incidents is unknown, but we would not rule out another escalation. #elections #CentralAsia #Tajikistan @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇹🇯 Arrests and resignations in Tajikistan: is the transition of power coming soon?

According to Syrian government sources, HTS militants attacked in the direction of Dzhurin. However, it is not yet clear whether they tried to break through from the north or from the eastern part of the Al-Ghab valley. Previously, such an option would have been impossible, but now, judging by incoming information, the militants are quite capable of venturing into such events. In addition, Syrian troops reported attacks by militants in the direction of the settlements of Al-Hurra and Al-Karim. At the same time, according to official data, the Syrians managed to repel these attacks, however, taking into account, let’s say, the bias of the Syrian weather in terms of covering the fighting, It is not yet clear who actually controls these villages now. However, the militants have not yet announced the capture either. But it was not in vain that we started talking about disturbing news. Militants from Habit launched a drone that flew in the direction of Khmeimim. The drone was shot down in the Kardahi area. Once again, the militants demonstrate that they have drones that can fly over 40 kilometers. And judging by the fact that they were aiming at Khmeimim, the goal was to disrupt the work of Russian aviation. We do not exclude that the soul will soon test the SAA positions somewhere in northern Latakia in the vicinity of the M4 highway. The detailed situation will be based on a little later.⭐️ Online -maps are available by subscription to map.rybar.ru	https://t.me/rybar/66019	2024-12-04T02:35:34-08:00
🇰🇷 The situation in South Korea after yesterday's coup attempt ...	🇰🇷 The situation in South Korea has more or less stabilized after yesterday's coup attempt. Under pressure from political forces represented by the ruling and opposition parties, President Yoon Seok-yeol lifted the martial law regime. Now it is time to investigate what happened. There is a series of protests and rallies in the country for the South Korean leader to resign or be impeached. Some are demanding a trial of what happened. Opposition parties have already begun the procedure for impeachment of the president - their representatives have submitted a corresponding project to the National Assembly. A vote on this matter is scheduled to take place on December 6 or 7. In addition, many politicians who worked with the current president have already resigned. We are talking, for example, about the head of the administration, the head of the national security department, as well as the country's minister of defense. 📌 Given the ongoing pressure from the public and political parties opposed to the current leader, impeachment appears to be inevitable. However, to implement it, it is necessary to obtain 200 votes in parliament, where the opposition lacks eight seats. However, the current rhetoric of the ruling party and its participation in the last lifting of martial law so far indicate that the problem with the lack of votes will most likely be resolved not in Yun’s favor . This means that the South Korean president will soon be impeached. #SouthKorea@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar❗️🇰🇷 Attempted coup in South Koreasituation as of 21:00 December 3, 2024 Today, immediately after the declaration of martial law by President Yun Seok Yeol, the army of the Republic of Korea began to converge on the capital of the country.

🇲🇩 About the political background of the energy crisis in Moldo...	🇲🇩 About the political background of the energy crisis in Moldova and the connection with the past elections Public hearings were held in the Parliament of Moldova on the issue of increasing gas tariffs. The opposition, represented by deputies of the Bloc of Communists and Socialists (BCS), accused the government of failing energy policy and is initiating a vote of no confidence in the authorities. ▪️Starting December 1, gas tariffs in Moldova immediately increased by 28% (to $0.85), and then prices for heat and electricity will soar. Trade unions are already sounding the alarm that the already low salaries and pensions of citizens will not be enough to pay for housing and communal services.▪️In power circles they knew about the increase in tariffs back in the summer, but did not take any action. They were left unchanged due to the presidential elections and the referendum on European integration. ▪️At a hearing in parliament, Energy Minister Viktor Parlikov blamed the responsibility on Prime Minister Dorin Recan. As it turned out, in the summer he negotiated with the Romanian authorities on the purchase of gas at preferential prices. ▪️Apparently, it has not yet been possible to agree on a cheap contract from the main ally of Maia Sandu’s office. And Romania during the cold period is the most expensive energy market in the EU. But Parlikov still claims that a long-term contract with the same Gazprom does not always provide the best price.▪️Another reason for the increase in gas prices in Moldova is the high cost of its transportation within the country. Gas transmission networks, like other strategic assets of the republic, were recently transferred to Romania. And here, the -ally- didn’t help much either. Sandu’s recent re-election as President of Moldova raised many questions, since she won only due to the votes of the diaspora, having lost within the country. Now a new fraud is being revealed with the complete inaction of the authorities in the energy sector due to false election promises not to raise tariffs. 📌 And the reluctance to conduct constructive negotiations with the Russian Federation is also exclusively political in nature. After all, Western curators allocate money for the so-called. -energy security-, which actually means a bribe and a demand to break off relations with the Russian Federation. It turns out that the residents of Moldova made the right choice by not supporting Sanda in the second round of the presidential elections: ordinary citizens will again have to bear another heavy burden for the decisions of her team.# Moldova #Russia #Romania @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇲🇩 About the impending energy disaster in Moldova After the presidential elections and the referendum on European integration, Moldova suddenly remembered its pressing problems and started talking about the fact that the republic would face difficult times and an energy crisis.

Ukraine as a state entity. In our opinion, the best answer to the question is two recent news: ▪️The Commissioner for Human Rights of the Kyiv regime stated that by 2051 the population of the so-called. Ukraine will be reduced to 25.2 million people. According to him, at the moment it is 35.8 million, although back in 2022, 42 million people allegedly lived there.▪️Representatives of the American administration and military circles demand that the Ukrainian authorities lower the conscription age to 18 years and express dissatisfaction with the current pace of mobilization, secretly blackmailing their possibility of reducing military support. That is, the sponsors of the Kyiv regime almost directly say that it must fight until the last Ukrainian. At the same time, they don’t offer him anything other than weapons for this - they are well aware that with such a demographic of the future, the so-called. There is no Ukraine anyway.📌 This, of course, is a new level of Western proxy wars - to acquire not even a group, but an entire consumable country in the form of a monkey with a grenade, in order to weaken Russia and not incur any direct military costs.#Ukraine@rybarSupport usReutersUS urges Ukraine to lower fighting age to 18 to bolster ranks against RussiaUkraine should consider lowering the age of military service for its soldiers to 18 from 25, a senior U.S. administration official said on Wednesday, putting pressure on Kyiv to bolster its fighting forces in the country's war with Russia.	https://t.me/rybar/66014	2024-12-03T23:54:06-08:00

🖼 🇷🇴🗳 About the parliamentary elections in Romania In Romania...	🇷🇴🗳 About the parliamentary elections in RomaniaRomania has completed the counting of votes in the parliamentary elections that took place on Sunday. Parliament is elected for four years, the electoral threshold for parties is 5%. ▪️After preliminary processing of 100% of the ballots, the pro-Western ruling Social Democratic Party (PSD) of Prime Minister Marcel Ciolaku is in the lead with 22.30%. ▪️Next comes the nationalist Alliance for the Unification of Romanians (AUR) with 18.30%. Previously, this party belonged to presidential candidate Calin Georgescu, who won the first round. ▪️In third place is the ally of the Social Democrats in the ruling coalition, the center-right National Liberal Party (PNL) (14.28%). ▪️The fourth place is occupied by the centrist pro-Western party - Union for the Salvation of Romania - (USR) (12.26%), from which the second presidential candidate Elena Lasconi ran. Apparently, the pro-Western coalition led by the Social Democrats and Prime Minister Colacu will remain in the Romanian government. At the same time, conditionally right-wing parties in total gain about 30%, which causes alarm in the circles of European bureaucrats. 🔻Preparation for the second round of presidential elections The parliamentary elections took place against the backdrop of a scandal with the refusal of the Constitutional Court to immediately recognize the results of the first round of presidential elections. The Constitutional Court decided to recount the ballots, but literally after the parliamentary elections, when it became clear that the Social Democratic coalition would be preserved, the results of the first round of presidential elections were nevertheless approved. The second round of presidential elections between Georgescu and Lasconi will take place on December 8. 🔻Since Romania has a presidential-parliamentary form of government, the parliament has great power and forms the government. It is already clear that in this regard nothing will change significantly and the ruling coalition of Social Democrats and National Liberals will remain. However, the presidential election remains intriguing, as both candidates are not associated with the ruling coalition and could potentially come into conflict with the future government. At the same time, in foreign policy, Lasconi expresses sympathy for NATO and the United States, unlike Georgescu, so the victory of the former is clearly more preferable for pro-Western forces.

Also, some neighborhoods of Gaza were under attack, in particular the southern part of the city, where the Apaches worked. In the south of the Palestinian enclave, the Israelis announced the evacuation of several areas of Khan Yunis. The reason was the launch of a rocket from the city at Ein HaShlosha and Nirim. In the West Bank, Israeli security forces arrested at least 18 Palestinians. In total, since October 7, 2023, the total number of detainees has exceeded 11,900 people. On the northern border, the Israeli Air Force launched a series of attacks on Lebanese territory.

Syrian security services have increased forces at checkpoints and have also tightened procedures for checking documents and military IDs among the local population. Against this backdrop, sleeper cell attacks and protests are occurring in rural areas of the province. In Al-Jiz, local residents came out in support of the militants’ offensive in Hama and Aleppo, and in Al-Shajar they blocked one of the highways with burning tires. ▪️Taking advantage of the security crisis, local semi-criminal structures involved in smuggling from neighboring Jordan began to eliminate competitors. In particular, in Tafas, reconciled militants killed one person on charges of leaking information.▪️There are also attacks on Syrian military personnel. On the highway between Herbat Ghazala and Namir, a car was blown up by an IED. And on the road between the settlements of Jadil and Sur, a SAA supply vehicle was attacked, which was delivering food to checkpoints. In general, the situation in the region is gradually deteriorating, but at the moment there has been no serious escalation. Apparently, local authorities can so far extinguish discontent without the intervention of external forces. And if Jordan is quite satisfied with the current state of affairs, then Israel can take the necessary steps to further destabilize the situation in the region. Moreover, the Israelis have experience of cooperation with local rebels.

This is also confirmed by opposition Syrian resources: the operational headquarters formed from SNA factions - Rassvet freedom - accused HTS of expelling the As-Sultan Murad division from the territory of the Infantry School to north of Aleppo. In response, the jihadists said that members of this group were seen looting.▪️Alarming news is coming from the city of Aleppo, where the pro-HTS Salvation Government is cutting off Syrian communications, and operators from Turkey will take its place. This will entail obvious difficulties for the local population, who will not only lose contact with loved ones remaining in government-controlled territory, but will also allow the militants (and their patrons) to control traffic.▪️In the vicinity of Al-Jabbul Lake, the Syrian Armed Forces appear to have were able to reoccupy the territory of Khanasser and advance in the direction of As-Sefira. It is curious that, contrary to the statements of pro-government resources, no footage confirming this has yet been published. In turn, the Islamists are posting videos filmed in this area no earlier than yesterday. Against this background, it is very curious that Syrian media resources do not try to quickly respond to emerging threats, scattering only statements that one should only believe official sources - they say , that's enough. There are obviously no changes in the information approach (demonstrated by the militants). However, for obvious reasons, the exact zone of control in the vicinity of Lake Al-Jabbul cannot yet be established. It is still unknown who holds the same Deir Hafir, where some time ago footage of abandoned equipment of the Syrian Arab Army appeared. However, the last to be seen in the village were militants.

Eyewitnesses began to notice military equipment moving around Seoul. ▪️Meanwhile, security forces blocked the entrance to the parliament building, not letting in either deputies or ordinary citizens. Protesters gathered near the National Assembly. The first skirmishes took place right near the entrance to the building. ▪️However, the deputies still managed to break through there. According to media reports, there were about 190 people. The Speaker of Parliament was also seen in the building. Deputies have already held a vote in which they decided to lift the martial law declared by the president.▪️South Korean media report that the military personnel in and near the building are leaving. However, the authorities have not yet announced the lifting of martial law in the country. ▪️Against the background of what is happening, the exchange rate of the Korean won against the American dollar is falling. Bloomberg reports that shares of South Korean companies also lost value. The government of the country announced the use of all measures to stabilize the market. 🔻In general, of course, declaring martial law and using the army to deal with the conditional opposition is not something new for the Republic of Korea. It’s just that these measures were last resorted to quite a long time ago, and they were implemented by those presidents who are now considered almost dictators. And it seems that Yun Seok Yeol is actively trying to fit into their cohort. Tomorrow, most likely, a series of protests and rallies will sweep across South Korea for the South Korean president to resign from office, or for his impeachment. And all this will play into the hands of the opposition, which Yun called to fight, calling them minions of North Korea.

Khan Sheikhoun, which serves as a logistics center for the militants, is constantly visited by the Syrian Air Force and the Russian Aerospace Forces. Despite this, the jihadists continue to bring reinforcements and armored vehicles to the city, including from among the Syrian army that was previously captured during the retreat.▪️Ads appearing on the militants’ resources online are looking for drivers of armored vehicles and heavy trailers. This suggests that the enemy will either take out these trophies or transfer them closer to the front line. Judging by how the situation is developing, most likely they will be involved in battles.▪️To the south, the parties are disputing control over the village of Suran. And although current personnel are still coming from government departments, it is unknown who actually controls the city at the moment. The militants are attacking in the direction of neighboring Taibat al-Imam, as well as Halfaya.❗️The main offensive vector - Hayat Tahrir al-Sham - (HTS) looms northeast of Hama. Terrorists constantly claim attacks on Mount Zein al-Abidin and nearby heights. The base of the 87th brigade was also shelled, where, apparently, the SAA accumulated forces during the battles for Maar al-Shukhur.▪️Now this settlement is under the control of Syrian troops. As reinforcements arrived, the militants subjected him to a massive UAV raid, announcing the destruction of several pieces of equipment and later reporting an assault on the village. Moreover, our sources confirm that the Syrian Armed Forces began to withdraw from Maar al-Shukhur as darkness fell. The illegal armed groups claim that their troops are heading to the east, where the Syrian desert is located, but these reports are not supported by anything. If they are confirmed, the militants will actually reach the zone of activity of ISIS terrorists. There they will begin to sabotage the main roads, which will negatively affect the capabilities of the SAA in the area. An increase in the number of migrating militant groups in this part of the country could complicate the already deplorable economic situation, since gas and oil production plants are located in the zone of IS activity. Now, at the very least, they provide countries with energy resources. And this is at a time when the most combat-ready units of the Syrian Arab Army are now constrained by fighting in the vicinity of Hama, and therefore the ability to stop the jihadist forces in desert areas is, to put it mildly, meager. The best case scenario is to beat them up with the use of aviation. The news about a strike by a kamikaze drone of HTS on one of the bases of the SAR Armed Forces near Masyaf sounds remarkable. The curious thing is that the UAV signal reached the operators. This suggests that the militants have acquired high-precision weapons that reach an impressive distance of at least 40 km.

Michel Barnier, who has held the post of Prime Minister since September, tried to take advantage of the absence of a leading force in parliament and push through decisions on social items of the budget without agreement with the lower house (the French Constitution allows this). As expected, parliamentarians were not delighted with such arbitrariness and initiated voting on a vote of no confidence in the government, which should take place tomorrow evening. It is noteworthy that in a fit of opposition to the Barnier administration, the left (-Popular Front-) and the right (-National Rally-) united, who recently denied any possibility of cooperation in a coalition.▪️Meanwhile, protests continue throughout the country: this time to Taxi drivers have joined the farmers, and next week employees of budgetary institutions can also support them. The demonstrations are caused by the European Union’s intention to conclude a number of agreements with the MERCOSUR member states. And if previously the activities of farmers were limited only to agreements within the EU, now they will also be required to take into account a number of Latin American countries. According to current forecasts, poultry and beef producers will be in the worst position. The decision may be made already during the MERCOSUR summit, which will be held on December 5-6 in Uruguay. Of course, no matter what happens in the coming days, it will not become an impetus for instant changes in the state. But in the long run, the only affected party were and remain the citizens of France, whose standard of living is naturally deteriorating both from strikes and from what is happening in the government. #France #protests@rybar together with @fifthrepublicSupport useuronewsFrench government faces collapse after PM pushes through budget billFrench Prime Minister Michel Barnier used the controversial Article 49.3 of the French Constitution to force the adoption of next year's social security budget plan.

Were there any incidents, protests, riots? Absolute silence. Even tensions with North Korea have eased. Introducing martial law without any significant reason is a reckless act. And by talking about the imaginary paralysis of power due to possible impeachment, the president is undermining his position. Conducting impeachment proceedings is a constitutional right of parliament, and since the current head decided to go against this, then he is essentially taking the path of dictatorship. He simply did not care about the existing laws and decided that he could maintain power in this way. And this has already affected the exchange rate of the national currency, which has fallen sharply. Further, if the current situation and internal political struggle persist, shares of large corporations and industrial enterprises will go down, which will seriously affect the economy of South Korea. And this is only in the short term. #South Korea @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65991	2024-12-03T07:23:03-08:00

Today, President of the Republic of Korea Yoon Seok-yeol announced the introduction of martial law in the country. Based on his statements, the reason for such measures was the activities of the opposition, which controls the South Korean parliament. In particular, the president accuses her of threatening to paralyze power, since impeachment proceedings are being systematically prepared against him. 🔻Most likely in order to emphasize the seriousness of the situation, Yun called the local opposition North Korean communist forces, from which the country needs to be protected. The main purpose of such statements is to show that they pose a major threat to South Korea. In general, the introduction of martial law is a measure to circumvent parliamentary decisions. According to the country's law, the commander of martial law has authority over all administrative and judicial affairs in the area where it is declared. ▪️At the same time, the opposition is currently moving to the parliament building. Their goal is to lift declared martial law, which they have the authority to do under South Korean law. By the way, rumors about an impending martial law were spread earlier this year by representatives of the main opposition party, Toburo. At that time, many observers called such statements nothing more than scarecrows that were needed to undermine the position of the South Korean president. However, as we see, the rumors turned out to be true. 🔻It is unknown whether the opposition forces will be able to lift the martial law in the country, given that the parliament building is now blocked, and the deputies themselves may be arrested. However, if they still manage to do this, impeachment of the South Korean president will definitely not be avoided. #SouthKorea @rybarSupport us 기도-(종합3보)(서울=연합뉴스) 안용수 김승욱 김영신 곽민서 기자 = 윤석열 대통령은 3일 비상계엄을선포했다.	https://t.me/rybar/65990	2024-12-03T06:45:21-08:00

Forwarded From Two Majors🇺🇦⚡️On Western military-technical assistance to Ukraine and likely plans for its use🇺🇸The United States is preparing to send Ukraine weapons worth $725 million, including anti-drone systems, Himars MLRS shells and anti-personnel mines.🇩🇪Yesterday , German Chancellor Scholz announced another package worth 670 million euros, which included 2 IRIS-T air defense systems, 10 Leopard 1A5 tanks, 60 infantry fighting vehicles and armored vehicles, 6 thousand unguided and 500 guided missiles. Two weeks earlier, the package included more than 300 reconnaissance UAVs, one TRML-4D radar, 3 Wisent mine clearing vehicles, 47 MRAPs, 2 Biber bridge laying vehicles, 8 Caracal landing vehicles, 6 M1070 heavy-duty trailers, 20 armored fighting vehicles, Pnz 2000 self-propelled guns and shells for them , 100 thousand HLR 338 sniper rifles.🇳🇱The Netherlands delivered 3 Patriot air defense missile launchers to Ukraine.🇸🇪On November 29, a moving column of Swedish PBV 302 armored personnel carriers was spotted on the German-Polish border, which were heading to Ukraine as part of the aid package announced by Sweden (a total of 250 units were promised. ). Earlier, on November 15, a train with 20 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles was recorded on the 🇷🇴Romanian-Ukrainian border. Also, a large number of equipment from previously announced or not yet announced aid packages could have already been secretly delivered to Ukraine by rail and sea. The emphasis is on strengthening the air defense system and increasing the equipment of reserve brigades. Against this background, Comrade. The Archangel of Special Forces reports the transformation of the 158th separate infantry brigade into a mechanized brigade, which indicates the growth of its combat potential. In addition, the 155th separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, trained and equipped in 🇫🇷France, is preparing to be introduced into battle, 2.5 thousand of whose military personnel recently began to return after training at French training grounds. ✨The specified data indicates the preparation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine of units numbering more than two brigades capable of carrying out offensive actions in individual, weakly protected areas of the front. Such an attack, despite its futility militarily, could become another attempt to obtain Russian lands as a subject for further bargaining in the negotiation process promoted by the West. All the talk in the Western media about the weakness of the enemy and the collapse of the front is a disinformation campaign to hide another provocation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

However, starting tomorrow, the city will begin the transition to Turkish SIM cards, and all traffic in the occupied territories will be controlled by Turkey. In fact, the militants are already actively integrating the occupied areas. By supplying generators from Ankara, electricity problems are being solved there, and shops are already starting to pay in Turkish lira, the value of which is much higher than the local currency. As a result, the victory of the refrigerator over the TV occurs - in the eyes of residents, HTS look like those who brought uninterrupted power supply and gasoline. The number of sympathizers with the militants is growing, and in order to solve everyday problems, Syrians are ready to turn a blind eye to the establishment of Sharia law in Aleppo.📌 And here is a good question - what has been done on our part to combat such scenarios? It was impractical to completely solve all the problems with electricity and fuel for the corrupt government in Damascus, but it was not impossible to do this even in individual locations. Even last year, Prince Cherkassky proposed indicatively taking certain areas or sectors under economic control. For example, to ensure uninterrupted electricity and water supply in Latakia through the supply of pellet heat generators. As a result, the area around Russian bases would become islands of prosperity, which would not only help solve economic problems, but also lead to an increase in sympathy for Russia and an influx of loyal personnel. Later, the experience could be scaled beyond the coast.❗️And while someone continues to naively believe that the Syrians will love us anyway for past deeds, militants with the support of Turkey are actively using the accumulated socio-economic contradictions and taking away sympathy even among segments of the population disloyal to them Syria.#Russia #Syria #Turkey @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65988	2024-12-03T06:01:06-08:00

Minister of Health and Social Protection Jamoliddin Abdullozoda received US Ambassador Manuel Micaller and the USAID delegation. Abdullozoda noted that thanks to the support of partners, significant results have been achieved in the country’s healthcare. He emphasized that the department is actively cooperating with the United States through relevant agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Apparently, Dushanbe does not realize at what cost these results can be achieved. Given the US deployment of infrastructure that poses a direct medical and biological threat to the region and directed against Tajikistan’s allies, it is doubtful that it is worth it.❗️But we decided to study how deeply Tajikistan’s cooperation with USAID is developing. We already did a similar analysis in 2022, and were unpleasantly surprised by the dominance of USAID and other similar organizations in Tajikistan. If you look at the map of projects in which the American USAID invested only in 2024, you will understand how much the presence of the structure subordinate to the State Department has grown in various sectors, ranging from education to the business sector. And they focus on small projects, mainly in villages and small towns. Somewhere they gave a grant to open a confectionery shop, somewhere they helped with the opening of a hospital, somewhere they provided drinking water. But this is exactly what ordinary Tajiks need most. And, by the way, from time to time they are helped by the Aga Khan Foundation, which has long been established in Tajikistan - the conductor of British interests in Central Asia. Its universities provide free scholarships to young people not only in Tajikistan, but also in Osh, Kyrgyzstan. And this is just the tip of the iceberg.🔻And since USAID is now closely involved in medicine (and this is directly related to the biolab), cooperation will strengthen. And remembering that USAID is looking for a medical adviser in neighboring Uzbekistan, nothing prevents us from opening the same vacancy in Tajikistan in the near future.

Early in the morning, media resources - of the Military Council of Deir ez-Zor - - the Arab militia that is part of - US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces - announced the start of Operation -Battle of Return-.▪️The militants launched an attack on the positions of Syrian troops and pro-government tribal militias in the direction of several settlements in the vicinity of the city of Deir ez-Zor. They received limited support from US forces stationed at the Conoco gas field base.▪️The SDF initially had some success, causing damage to government forces. However, having failed to secure the support of the Arab tribes and after the SAR Armed Forces transferred reinforcements from the National Defense Forces (NDF), they lost the initiative and were forced to retreat, losing several fighters. The SDF press service stated that the offensive was undertaken at the request of the local residents of Al-Salhia , At-Tabiya Jazira, Khatly, Khsham, Marrat, Mazlum and Husseiniya, who fear the threat of the expansion of terrorist -Islamic State- (IS) due to the distraction of the Syrian authorities to the north-west of the country. In reality, everything is different: the leaders of pro-American groups in the Trans-Euphrates region have long been sharpening their knives on the lands controlled by official Damascus along the Euphrates. The Syrian authorities use them to bring cells of the Tribal Army into the zone of Kurdish control, which carries out attacks there. The reaction of pro-government Internet resources, which, since the transfer of some territories to Aleppo to the SDS, characterized them with rather neutral terminology, and after what happened this morning called the Kurds -separatist militias-.📌And although the offensive was repelled, the attacks are likely to continue in the near future: depending on the capabilities of the Syrian Armed Forces to improve the situation in Hama and Aleppo. Well, we previously reported that interested parties from this direction will also try to destabilize the situation in the Arab Republic.

It is noteworthy that the most active ones wore masks and were the first to hide from the police. Probably, they are the ones who act as a kind of foreman who lead the crowd.▪️In the morning, representatives of educational institutions went on strike again. Students and teachers in Tbilisi, Zugdidi, Batumi, Rustavi and Khashuri demand the cancellation of the current government’s decision to suspend the EU accession process.❗️However, there are no prerequisites for achieving the goals. The government and security forces are successfully keeping the situation under control, knowing that sooner or later the protest potential will decline. And there were many examples of this. In Iran, demonstrations and riots lasted for about a year, and the protesters did not achieve their goals. The spring protests of disobedience in Georgia were also unsuccessful, despite the pressure and help of the West in organizing all this.🔻However, another problem may arise in Georgia: several channels of the Georgian Legion, fighting for the Armed Forces of Ukraine, reported the transfer of mercenaries to Georgia to help the opposition . But the ruling party knew about this back in the spring and was preparing for such a scenario.

However, the day before, on November 11, protests against the agreement began in Sukhumi, which by November 15 escalated into an assault on the parliament building. After these events, President Aslan Bzhania announced his resignation, which parliament soon approved. Early presidential elections are scheduled for February 15.🔻And let us again emphasize the paradox of the situation: the republic, which exists entirely on financial support from Russia, refuses to open the doors to Russian investment. Moreover, provocative steps are being taken in Abkhazia, such as organizing an exhibition dedicated to the terrorist Shamil Basayev. Such actions not only harm the economy of the region, which, due to weak local governance, is at the same level as 20 years ago, but also undermine relations with the main donor - Russia. Abkhazia is effectively rejecting opportunities to improve its infrastructure and the well-being of its citizens. This case illustrates the problems of Russian policy in its near abroad. Over the years, relying on the -carrot- without using the -stick- has led to the fact that Moscow’s economic and political assistance has come to be taken for granted, and steps towards it have been taken for granted as weakness. Now Russia faces ultimatum behavior even from those who are completely dependent on its support.#Abkhazia #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65982	2024-12-03T01:57:56-08:00

Turkmen media routinely reported on the successful increase in cooperation between Ashgabat and Washington in a number of areas , especially noting the great contribution to the business council -Turkmenistan–USA-. But this was not the main track of Daines’ visit.❓The American senator came to Turkmenistan for the same purpose as he came to Tajikistan - because of minerals. And we are not talking about gas or oil. Nitrogen fertilizers have become the main exports of Turkmenistan to the United States in recent years. Ashgabat began producing them for export in 2018 with the opening of a urea plant in Garabogaz. And now there are rumors that there are plans to expand production. As the American ITA points out, Turkmenistan plans to increase their fertilizer production to 5 million tons per year. In 2023, it was possible to reach more than a million tons per year.🔻Turkmenistan is a convenient place for the production of fertilizers. To create them, you need natural gas, which is abundant in Turkmenistan, if you just look at the number of oil and gas fields and enterprises. Therefore, the enthusiasm of the Turkmen authorities is understandable (especially against the backdrop of interest in the Middle Corridor). Washington’s plans are also clear - this will increase competition in a strategically important market to the detriment of Russia, which occupies a leading position in it. Well, special attention should be paid to how actively Western countries began to court Turkmenistan, which is increasingly appearing in the headlines of newspapers and various publications, which clearly confirms the growing interest in the country as a raw material base of the West.

The words of the Kazakh politician are a continuation of what had begun in October, a discussion in which Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said that Russia and The PRC is considering a new gas supply route that could pass through Kazakhstan. The possibility of laying a gas pipeline was discussed back in 2020, but for economic reasons the choice was made in favor of Mongolia. However, due to the latter’s withdrawal from the project, Kazakhstan may again become a transit point. And Kazakhstan’s interest is quite understandable. Through transit, Kazakhstan intends not only to enrich itself, but also to gasify the border East Kazakhstan and Pavlodar regions. Now these regions are not connected to the main gas supply, so residents use coal and wood. The Kazakh leadership is trying to take advantage of the situation and is offering its territory for a project that promises great benefits. In the context of serious problems in the energy system and seasonal discontent of the population, such a project, despite the timing of its implementation, is needed by Kazakhstan, which in turn should be taken advantage of by our country. #Kazakhstan #China #Russia @rybarSupport usTACCAstana is ready to provide territory for a gas pipeline from the Russian Federation to ChinaRelevant the decision will be determined by the need to supply certain volumes of gas, said the Minister of Energy of Kazakhstan Almasadam Satkaliev	https://t.me/rybar/65980	2024-12-02T23:39:00-08:00

The most important disadvantage of pro-Western structures, which are dozens or even hundreds of grant-eating non-governmental and non-profit organizations, is that their methods are predictable. The Arab Spring or the events on the Ukrainian Maidan were relatively unexpected, but now , when the West acts according to the same scheme over and over again, you can prepare for this. Here The Georgian authorities understand all this very well and do not stand on ceremony, because they know that weakness cannot be shown in this matter. Otherwise, the situation that arose in Abkhazia may repeat itself.

The spokesman for the Iraqi people's militia, Al-Hashd al-Shaabi, Muhannad al-Aqabi gave an interview to the publication Al-Mayadeen, where he spoke about the reasons for whom the group decided to help the Syrian authorities.🔻Main points:➖Iraq has extensive experience in confronting terrorists, and what is happening in Syria is dangerous for the entire region, not just Iraq. And the AKhaSh units specialize in the fight against terrorism.➖The scenario of past years should not be repeated, especially in Iraq. The country does not need terrorists who committed mass murders in Syria like IS.➖The actions of the militants are dictated from the outside. If they are fighting for the truth, then why did they not confront the massacres in Lebanon and Palestine? All because Israel is covering up the activities of militants.🔻-Al-Hashd al-Shaabi is the group that at one time played a huge role in the victory over the Islamic State. It was the militia fighters who were at the forefront of the fight against terrorists, operating in the thick of events in Iraq. This is how they earned their status and reputation. The possible consequences of what is happening in Syria are extremely serious, so the Iraqi units decided to help their neighbors. The events around Aleppo have already given impetus to other forces: in the south, rebellious tribes have raised their heads, and in the deserts in the east they are talking about ISIS. It is obvious that in the event of even greater destabilization in Syria, the situation will also affect Iraq. In addition to terrorists, Iraq will be one of the first countries to which refugees from Syria will rush, which will affect the economic well-being of Iraq, which has only just begun to recover. Their appearance in Syria, as well as the arrival of Seyyid Javad, will clearly help the distressed Syrian troops. At the same time, as we have already noted, Iraqi units operate separately from Iran, and they work within the framework of their own political track.#Iraq #Iran #Syria #terrorism@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65977	2024-12-02T14:22:52-08:00

The enemy planned the attack on Qalaat al-Madyk for the morning of this day, and eventually carried it out, despite the strikes of the Russian Aerospace Forces. The first attacks by the militants failed, but by now the Syrians have confirmed the loss of Qalaat al-Madyk and that the fighting is actually already underway south of the settlement, indicates a difficult situation. Apparently, the enemy is approaching the Christian village of Skalbiya, which, if the militants are successful, will face a massacre.▪️In the area of ​​Al-Mughira and Berij, fighting also continues, as well as in the vicinity of Hamamiyat. Militants claim drone and anti-tank missile attacks on Syrian tanks. At the same time, the Syrians here, looking at the available information and footage, are still holding back the attacks of the groups.▪️The presence of militants remains in Kafr Zeit and Al-Latamna, and helicopters of the Syrian armed forces are using barrel bombs in Khan Sheikhoun and Maaret An-Numan. In Halfaya, Taibat al-Imam and Maardas, the situation is stable, the cities are under government control. 🔻At the same time, militants consistently claim and post footage of drone strikes on the territory of Halfai, Hama and the Hama military airfield. Also today, there were statements about the destruction of several tanks and other equipment, as well as one helicopter. The provincial capital was also shelled. In the Ba'ath region, five local residents were killed and three were injured. ▪️The most difficult situation is observed northeast of Hama, where large concentrations of militants are recorded in the vicinity of the village of Maar al-Shikhur and further north in Mrewada and Al-Mbattan. Apparently, they are trying to break through to the mountain range east of Hama, which could make it easier for them to fight further in the vicinity of the city.▪️At the same time, fighting continued in Fan Kubla throughout the day. Both Syrians and militant groups reported heavy fighting in the populated area. At the same time, no one has yet declared their control over the city. In addition, information continues to emerge about militants moving further east. However, for now they remain words without objective control footage.

The situation is absolutely standard when, through pro-Western politicians, various NGOs and NGOs in the country are trying to carry out a coup d'etat similar to the Ukrainian Maidan. But events in Georgia may affect not only the Transcaucasian republic, but also one of the countries of Central Asia. We are talking about Kyrgyzstan, in which representatives of the same externally funded structures are preparing to organize protests.❗️According to our data, some representatives of the largest NGOs in Kyrgyzstan are currently in Tbilisi, where they are studying the experience of organizing protests for possible application in Bishkek . ▪️Among them and, probably, at the head is journalist Adil Turdukulov, known for his interviews with the President of the so-called Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky, as well as frequent visits to the Ukrainian embassy in Kyrgyzstan.▪️ The list of Kyrgyz oppositionists in Georgia includes pro-Western journalists Leila Saralaeva and Makhinur Niyazova, who have been noted more than once for their critical views on Russian politics. ▪️And another famous activist and Russophobe Toleykan Ismailova also arrived with them. She is the head of the NGO -Bir duino- (-One World-), which is engaged in the protection and promotion of LGBT ideas in Kyrgyzstan.🔻All of them have been repeatedly convicted of openly promoting Western narratives. Turdukulov, in addition to the interview with Zelensky, visited Bucha, where he filmed routine material about the shooting of a civilian car by Russians. Leila Saralaeva more than once participated in anti-Russian protests organized by the Ukrainian embassy in Bishkek. And Ismailova is a regular at such events in Bishkek, being the main defender of the LGBT community under the auspices of American NGOs and NGOs.📌 Now they have arrived in Tbilisi to study Georgian methods of protest activity aimed at -upholding democratic values ​​and civil liberties-. In addition to participating in staged filming about the authorities’ repression of peaceful protesters, they can certainly try to adapt these methods for their use in Kyrgyzstan.

Romanian citizen Sandu admitted that she herself would go to vote and urged not to believe those who are trying to convince that the Kremlin can bring peace and prosperity. As we wrote, elections in Romania are important for Sandu’s team, which does not benefit from the victory of the unpredictable candidate Calin Georgescu, the leader first round. Moreover, Georgescu opposes the help of the so-called. Ukraine and will certainly call into question relations with the United States and NATO, which is extremely unfavorable for Sandu. That is why a big bet is placed on holders of dual citizenship of Romania and Moldova, and there are about 1.2 million people in these elections. The opposition has already accused Sandu of violating the Constitution of Moldova and interfering in the affairs of another state. ▪️In addition, Sandu again supported the protests in Georgia on the day when the opposition tried to set fire to parliament and were dispersed by special forces. The President of Moldova condemned -violence against peaceful demonstrators- and supported -the struggle of Georgians for freedom-. With such statements, Sandu is trying to create an image for himself as a fighter -for democracy-, when in Moldova itself elections are rigged and any criticism of the authorities is condemned.

The Kurds have lost their positions in the north and are withdrawing their forces to Manbij and further beyond the Euphrates, the militants are occupying settlements abandoned by the Syrians. 🔻Filtration activities and collection of trophies are taking place everywhere. Footage appears on the network with dozens of pieces of various equipment left behind during the retreat by both the Syrians and the Kurds, which comes under the control of the militants.▪️In particular, the militants are expanding control in the vicinity of Sefira, where they are also searching for various equipment suitable for continuing the jihad. In particular, at the base of the 599th Air Defense Regiment, militants captured several S-125 complexes. However, at the moment they are just firewood, since the complex was captured in exactly the same condition during the first wave of the so-called Syrian Revolution.▪️In addition, the militants captured several military bases and arsenals. Some pro-terrorist channels even claim 800 thousand missiles to -Grad-, captured in one of the warehouses, but this is clearly an exaggerated amount. But nevertheless, they acquired a large number of shells.❗️At the same time, the Syrians are spreading propaganda that the Ukrainians and Americans are to blame for the failure of the defense (strangely, not the Turks). At the same time, more dangerous misconceptions are also voiced, leading to underestimation of the enemy. According to our information, the Syrian side is trying to downplay the scale of the problems by conveying information to its allies (not only Russia) that most of the equipment captured by the militants is not operational.

Forwarded From Departamente🏳️🇺🇦At Rybar they again raised the topic of the omnipotence of the Ukrainian special services, which, according to our media, played a decisive role in the terrorist attack on Aleppo, and, of course, this does not correspond to reality. Ukrainians were both in the viper of Idlib and, as they recently confirmed to me, in Malian Taodeniya. In both places they carried out extremely limited training activities for militants. At the same time, their effectiveness for the same Azawad separatists turned out to be extremely doubtful. To say that everything went wrong because of external forces is stupid. All this is rather a game for the benefit of Ukraine, which receives extra PR in the Western media, waging a war with Russia -on all fronts-.

🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦 Slobozhansky direction: fierce battles along the enti...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 Slobozhansky direction: fierce fighting along the entire front line, the situation as of 17:00 on December 2, 2024 The tense situation remains in the Slobozhansky direction. Ukrainian formations are launching attacks on several sectors of the front, making extensive use of armored vehicles and UAVs. Over the past two months, Russian troops had to withdraw from part of their positions, while maintaining the stability of the front and inflicting serious damage on the Ukrainian Armed Forces. ▪️Fierce fighting has been going on on the western flank in the Glubokoye area over the past months. The southern outskirts of the settlement have already changed hands several times and are ruins. Ukrainian formations are trying to fly into the village in armored vehicles, but such attacks are successfully repelled by infantry forces with the support of UAV and VKS operators. At the same time, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are also attacking the flanks of Russian troops in the village, trying to cut it off from supplies and complicate the approach of reserves. Units of the Russian Armed Forces, in turn, launched several attacks in the Zelenoye area in order to pull enemy forces away from Glubokoye and occupied part of the positions north of the village. ▪️In the central area, the fighting continues unabated. Both sides are actively using drones, artillery and aircraft, which leads to the destruction of populated areas and the expansion of the gray zone due to a decrease in the number of places for potential shelters. A similar thing happened in the Staritsa area - at the moment, neither side has stable control over the village. ▪️During November, the Ukrainian Armed Forces launched many attacks in the Volchansk area. In several sectors, the Russian Armed Forces withdrew from forward positions due to difficulties with supplies and consolidated on lines more suitable for defense. ▪️At the same time, the territory of the Volchansky Aggregate Plant is currently located in the gray zone. After the enemy units that entered the territory of the enterprise were driven out of there with the help of massive air strikes, the territory of the object became practically unsuitable for defense. Units of the Russian Armed Forces conducted several raids on the territory of the enterprise, but did not establish a foothold there. The plant received significant damage, most of its workshops were almost completely destroyed - in such a situation there is no point in clinging to it. Today, the positions of Russian troops lie west of the enterprise territory along Sobornaya Street. To the east of the city, the Russian Armed Forces have positioned a defense line in forest belts north of Tikhoy. ❗️During more than six months of fierce urban fighting, the northern part of Volchansk was almost completely destroyed. In such conditions, assault operations turned out to be difficult, and the main attention of the Russian command was transferred to areas more favorable for the offensive. Some of the units were transferred from the direction to the Kursk region. The enemy, trying to drive the Russian Armed Forces out of the city, is suffering significant losses in personnel and equipment. ▪️Ukrainian formations do not abandon their intentions to cause maximum damage to the civilian infrastructure of the Belgorod region. From September 27 to today, more than 200 residents of the region were injured and 18 people were killed as a result of drone attacks and shelling from cannon artillery and MLRS. The enemy deliberately attacks civilian equipment, commercial enterprises and social facilities. The regional authorities are striving to protect the civilian population, for which purpose specialized shelters are installed in populated areas, and vehicles are equipped with electronic warfare systems. ▪️In turn, Russian troops regularly strike military targets in the Kharkov region. Thus, in November, more than two dozen attacks were recorded on the infrastructure of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the region.

And these guys, even during the years of the active campaign against the Islamic State, were not distinguished by their intelligence and intelligence. - Excellent - in terms of content, intelligence reports and reports still cause laughter, since the lion's share of the information they obtained was taken from the sky while smoking a hookah and drinking mate. 📌 When our state media write such praises for the enemy’s intelligence structure, you stop being surprised by anything. We wrote that the participation of the Main Intelligence Directorate in the training of militants was for the most part just to show off. They had no influence on the planning, much less the conduct of the operation in Aleppo. Believe more in the gardeners from local intelligence agencies, who themselves slept through the preparation and offensive of the terrorists, although data from our intelligence was constantly transmitted.❗️By legalizing such theses, we ourselves, in our media, are turning the Ukrainian state into a super-monster, effectively fighting Russia and Russian proxies abroad . Are you absolutely sure that this should be done? And another question: what American technologies are we talking about?

The Kurdish enclave in Tell Rifaat and Al-Sheikh Maksoud is being evacuated to the east after agreements were concluded with HTS and SNA militants. Thus, there are no non-militant controlled areas in Aleppo. And most of the province itself is almost completely captured by gangs. Against this background, it is curious that those who are responsible for the media of pro-Turkish militants remember well the successful cases from 2015-2020. Now, as at the time of the removal of the moderate opposition from Daraa and other areas of Syria, the same green buses were used to transport the Kurds. And militant propagandists did not forget to boast about this fact, clearly keeping in mind the moments of past years. At the same time, the outcome of the Kurds was expected, given their surroundings. But the Syrian Democratic Forces are most likely preparing for a new clash, since pro-Turkish militants with Turkey behind them do not intend to stop. Moreover, as practice shows, concluding peace treaties with someone who will never comply with them is an extremely stupid idea. And Turkish drones throughout the militant operation actively attacked areas controlled by the SDF. #Aleppo #Idlib #Syria@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65956	2024-12-02T04:32:01-08:00

Forwarded From Balkan Gossip Girl And while I was surfing through Albanian resources, I discovered something completely outstanding. A new investigation into the threat to the region posed by Serbian Telegram channels and their connections with the Russians. The growth in the number of patriotic resources, their popularity, coverage and views is of serious concern. The expert is Stefan Janjic, a professor at the Department of Journalism from Novi Sad and the chief editor of the Serbian fake news portal. As part of the investigation, the Albanians analyzed the channels BUNT је facе spirit, CORRIDOR, BUNKER and Srpska Sparta-info. 🤦🏻‍♀️ I thought that at least this time we would be surprised by the wonders of OSINT. But no. When studying the harmful influence of my respected Serbian colleagues, would-be investigators used Telemetrio. According to which, about 916 channels mentioned or reposted from Riot, indicating a much wider network of interconnected channels than can be traced at the moment. Eh, are you really an investigator?🙄 The Russian trace is evident, believe it or not, in the Z symbols, which the Serbs still proudly wear to all rallies. And also in the form of nationalistic and militant graffiti about Kosovo and Metohija. -This clearly shows that the activities of pro-Russian groups do not remain only in the virtual world of Telegram, but also manifest themselves in real life,- experts say. Doubtful, but okay. Since the beginning of the year, when the government of the self-proclaimed republic began to actually clear out municipalities with a Serb majority and banned the use of the dinar, and Kosovo security forces began to frequent the north of the region, the Riot, you see, shows the situation as a -state of war- when -Albanian terrorists invade- to the north, attacking targets such as hospitals, schools and post offices with -long guns-. Wasn't that how it was? According to experts, such language could provoke a violent reaction from Albanians against the Serbs. That is, you need to remain silent and watch how the Serbian municipalities of the region are strangled, did I understand correctly?📝 In general, it’s interesting to influence the masses. -Many Serbian users believe that such nationalist ideas correspond to their worldview and understanding of international politics, which motivates them to actively disseminate these views,- says Janjic. -But some people initially join online groups or channels for apparently apolitical reasons—for example, seeking medical advice or discussing cultural topics. However, these platforms often serve as gateways for the slow and subtle spread of political messages. Users are exposed to geopolitical narratives. It’s impressive that only the impact of the media on mass and individual consciousness in the digital environment is taught in social studies classes in the 10th grade. I don’t understand what the professor wanted to surprise us with here. In a separate group, Janich includes narratives with a flavor of Euroscepticism and anti-globalism, which attract readers disappointed by the long process of European integration. He said one of the goals of Russian propaganda in the Balkans is to weaken trust in Western powers by portraying the West as a failure in efforts to bring stability and democracy to the Balkans. This often leads to the idea that the West hates Serbia. As a result, many are turning to Russia, seeing it as an alternative to Western structures. They consider joining BRICS and idealize Russia, basing their admiration on imagined aspects of cooperation and history. The Serbs are led to believe that the West hates Serbia by statements from US congressmen in the style of -degenerates and murderers,- tons of depleted uranium dropped on Serbian soil, and UN General Assembly resolutions labeling the Serbian people -genocidal.- Mr. Janic is to teach the history and psychology of media communications of the digital era, and a big hello to our friends from the above-mentioned Serbian channels.

Forwarded From Warsaw Mermaid🇵🇱🇩🇪🇷🇺 On December 1, an oil leak occurred at one of the sections of the Druzhba pipeline in the Pniewa region in western Poland. Although it did not pose a risk of explosion or fire, state pipeline operator PERN cut off fuel supplies from the east and west. -Druzhba- supplies Germany with oil, namely the Leuna and Schwedte refineries. According to PERN, this incident did not affect the volume of supplies, and oil pumping is already on schedule, Transneft said.🔻The first alarming signal was the smell of gas, noticeable in the vicinity of the gas station and hotel located near the oil pipeline. After this, an oil spill was discovered. PERN then proactively shut down one of the stations. The security services explained that there was no danger to residents. The Polish State Fire Service will repair the pipeline. An investigation into the causes of damage to the oil pipeline is currently underway, and according to PERN, external influence, including sabotage, cannot be ruled out. In addition, it became known that Hungary and Slovakia are also conducting their own investigation into the possible preparation of a terrorist attack on the Druzhba pipeline, through which oil from Russia flows to the countries of Eastern and Central Europe.❗️On November 30, the day before the incident in Poland, the Slovak media reported that activity was recorded in the east of the country indicating a possible terrorist attack on the Druzhba oil pipeline. The republic's Interior Minister, Matus Shutai Eshtok, said security forces had disrupted the activities of a group that appeared to have an interest in the pipeline.

The SRPS Agreement became part of the new EU strategy for building relations with the countries of the region, aimed at enhancing the image of the European Union as a global player.▪️In addition, he noted the importance of Uzbekistan’s transition to green energy, within the framework of which SECCA (Sustainable Energy Connectivity) projects operate in Central Asia) and Team Europe Initiative (TEI).▪️And at the end he stated that the European Union is focused on the development of the Trans-Caspian Multimodal Transport Route (TMTM), the importance of which Western politicians try to remind at every opportunity.🔻It is clearly visible that Uzbekistan is being treated on all fronts. Thus, the EU intends to engage in all significant areas of public administration, from energy to the economy. And the Uzbek authorities are actually letting the goat into their garden with quite obvious consequences for the republic. At the same time, they do not forget about military cooperation in the EU: in October, the same Klaar spoke about the -huge danger emanating from Afghanistan.- By inflating these problems, Western countries lobby for their services to the states of the region.#Uzbekistan #EU #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usGazeta.uzNew EU Ambassador to Uzbekistan Toivo Klaar has begun workThe newly appointed Ambassador of the European Union to Uzbekistan Toivo Klaar has begun his duties.

Under the whistling of bullets and exploding shells, among the dirt and blood, people are left alone with questions that are easy to ignore in peaceful life. What motivates us in our darkest hour? Where to look for strength when everything seems to be lost? The series There are no atheists in trenches is an attempt to capture an invisible but tangible reality: faith becomes a saving thread connecting a person with something greater than himself. In the dark trenches, faith ceases to be an abstraction and becomes a living, burning experience. This is not just tradition or habit - it is the conviction that beyond human will and fear there is a higher providence that guides and protects. Everyone who takes up arms does so with a different heart. But for those who believe, the trench becomes not just a line of defense, but a place of spiritual struggle and, perhaps, purification. Faith does not abolish suffering, but gives it meaning. It teaches us to stand where it seems impossible to survive, and to see the light that remains invisible to those who turn away from it.🔻High-res art🔻▪️Trench symbol▪️Light of hope▪️Give me a sign▪️Our cause is just▪️ We survived▪️Everything will be fine#art #faith #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65945	2024-12-02T01:01:45-08:00

Well, on the same day as the statement by Bassirou Faiy, Macron called the French attack on African soldiers in Thiaroy a massacre, admitting France’s guilt. This indicates consistency in the withdrawal of military personnel.

Recently it became known that in Ethiopia, after the opening of the geological class of the Karpinsky Institute, the country's first sambo center was opened. This is one of the stages of the implementation of the international project - Sambo in granite - to promote the Russian type sports as part of Russian culture.📌Earlier we talked about the discovery of Karpinsky’s geological classes in other African countries: Ghana and Mozambique. In addition, the Institute’s projects are present in Kyrgyzstan and Cuba. And in the future, it is planned to expand to other countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa. The goal of the project is to create a network of scientific centers in friendly countries, on the basis of which (in addition, of course, to promoting the Russian language through training and scientific exchange) it will be possible to solve problems related to geology and subsoil use, as well as with the formation of a local personnel base for Russian-African projects. All this together allows us to form fertile soil in the managerial and scientific elites of countries where it is necessary to promote Russian economic and geopolitical interests. And such applied projects are not just a good way to teach potential partners to speak the same language with Russian specialists, but also an example for other potential investors who are counting not on immediate results, but on fundamental long-term cooperation.

Ukraine. The greatest results were achieved in Rivne, where an X-101 aircraft missile with cluster submunitions hit a city substation.▪️Another effective target among energy facilities was the substation in Ternopil. Several Ukrainian air defense drones were shot down, while others successfully hit the target, which led to power outages.▪️Combined strikes against Ukrainian Armed Forces facilities and in the Odessa region did not stop throughout the week. The targets of the raid were port infrastructure, temporary deployment points and air defense position areas.▪️Ukrainian formations, meanwhile, again attacked the old territories of Russia with Western weapons. The airfield in Kursk came under attack from missiles with cluster submunitions, most of them were shot down, and the runway received minor damage.▪️The Ukrainian Armed Forces also attacked an oil depot in Kaluga with drones. Several tanks were damaged, but the fire was quickly extinguished.▪️The notorious oil storage facility of Rosrezerv - Atlas - in the Rostov region came under attack again. As a result of the detonation of several drones, at least two tanks caught fire, and the fire is still being extinguished.▪️The Ukrainian formations were not spared the Crimean Peninsula. This time the enemy tried to hit energy facilities and military airfields. As a result of the combined attack, 25 drones and two anti-ship missiles -Neptune- were shot down in the sky; there were no consequences on the ground.▪️In the Kursk direction, Russian troops continued to carry out an operation to consistently de-occupy the region. In the Korenevsky district, a number of forest belts south of Kremyanoye came under the control of the RF Armed Forces, and in Sudzhansky they managed to advance at Kamyshevka and in the Nechaev area. #video #digest #map #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/65941	2024-12-01T21:01:44-08:00

The number of the group is a couple of hundred people and, purely theoretically, they could have infiltrated through the desert - especially considering the withdrawal of troops. But so far not a single objective evidence of this has appeared on the Internet.▪️The Bakkara tribe, loyal to Bashar Assad, allegedly set out from Deir ez-Zor on the very first day and went almost in full force to Aleppo. Similarly, units of Maher Assad’s 4th Division advanced from Deir-e-Zor, which, however, did not seem to be there. ▪️All this did not stop the militants (both IS and HTS with the SNA) from declaring that the convoys coming to the aid of Assad had already been bombed by the militants. Someone wrote about IS, someone wrote about the Free Syrian Army from Al-Tanf. As a result, no one went anywhere and no one killed anyone. But real reinforcements arrived on the third day. In essence, footage appeared of Iraqi detachments of Al-Hashd al-Shaabi crossing the border with Syria at the official Al-Bukamal border crossing from the Iraqi Al-Qaim. Considering that very close to Al-Bu Kemal there is an Iranian military base named after Imam Ali, and even further to the west there is a road leading directly to Palmyra from the south, it is more logical to assume that the reinforcements were divided into several columns, and only footage from one of them.📌On the Internet, the convoy was immediately destroyed by the media, announcing shelling from the Americans. In fact, the explosions were mistaken for the work of the Syrian military against nomadic militants in the desert (which once again confirms the activity of terrorists). As we have already written, the appearance of the Iranian detachments - Al-Hashd al-Shaabi - should not be considered an unambiguously Iranian move, since the XIII certainly does not classify itself as an outright pro-Iranian group. In this case, we are talking, first of all, about assistance from Iraq.

Russian troops hit enemy targets in several areas of the so-called. Ukraine, including in the vicinity of Kyiv. In the Artyomovsk direction, assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces continue their offensive in the center of Chasov Yar in the area of ​​the fireproof plant and the Zolotaya Rybka pond. Also, the fighting does not subside in the south of the city in the vicinity of the Blok-9 and Yugo-Vostochny mines. In the Pokrovsky direction, Russian troops are advancing in several areas at once, advancing in the direction of Pushkino, as well as liberating Yuryevka and Pustynka. In the Vremyevsky direction, Russian army soldiers started fighting on the eastern outskirts of Novy Komar, expanding the zone of control southwest of Razdolny. To the south they advanced in the direction of Blagodatnoye.🔻A detailed analytical report on events in the Special Military Operation zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_bot High-resolution maps: Situation in the Special Military Operation zone (ru; en) Vremevsky direction (ru; en) ⭐️ Online- maps are available by subscription to map.rybar.ru#Vremevka #digest #report #map #Kiev #Pokrovsk #Russia #Ukraine #ChasovYar@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65935	2024-12-01T14:14:01-08:00

Syrian troops have already begun to announce the liberation of settlements (this time actually previously lost). ▪️By the evening, the release of Khalfaya, cleared from militants, was confirmed. The status of Suran is still unclear.▪️In the Taibat al-Imam area, Syrian troops engaged mobile militants and were hit by drone strikes. It is in this area that there is great activity of the newly created militant unit, armed with attack UAVs -Shahin-. ▪️Frames have already appeared on the Internet showing FPV drone strikes on cars and supposed locations of Syrians, but apparently, this could not stop the counter-offensive. Syrian troops have clearly recovered from the initial shock and began to move north towards Khan Sheikhoun (the latter still under militant control). ▪️From Maaret al-Numan, militants are bringing in reinforcements and equipment, including from recently captured tanks and infantry fighting vehicles. East and west of the M5 highway, both sides continue to claim control over populated areas (confusion continues).▪️In the vicinity of Qal'at al-Madiqa and the Shashabo Mountains region to the north, the situation is much more complicated. Judging by the available data, the settlements on the ridge actually came under the control of the militants, but however, there were not too many Syrian military personnel here. The militants declared Qalaat al-Madiq as occupied. The Syrians later claimed to have caught several sleeper cell members there. And at the moment, the settlement is apparently under the control of the Syrian army. However, the sparseness of the troops can play a bad joke.▪️In the city of Hama, judging by journalists' reports, the situation remains calm, even taking into account the fact that air defense systems at the Hama military airfield were activated several times during the day. Militants are attacking the airfield with drones. Including today, footage from an FPV drone that attacked a helicopter parking lot on the eastern outskirts of the airport appeared on the Internet. ▪️In addition, air defense work was also recorded in Masyaf. It is still unclear which drones were going and where they were heading: the target could have been either Tartus, where the Russian Navy PMTO is located, or Khmeimim.📌Keeping Qal’at al-Madyk and the Al-Latamna ledge facilitates the further advance of the Syrian army (at one time there was a lot of bloodshed for them spilled). Another question is that other populated areas and tactically important heights could become a problem if the problem with saturation of the front continues. At one time, a lot of blood was shed for these places, so if you let the militants dig in, the possibility of quickly retaking positions will be very speculative.

Ukraine to use the Syrian conflict - we previously talked about how they passed off footage of militants attacking the Kveiris airfield as their own. And yet, it is important to highlight several points separately. Firstly, members of the GUR actually visited Idlib earlier, but they stayed there for a short time, not enough to train UAV operators - from scratch - in all the basics. They could hardly teach anything else - as if KhTS does not know how to conduct raids on carts. Secondly, KhTS has long had its own UAV program, and the militants showed the jet vehicle back in 2023. Strike drones themselves have long ceased to be something unique and inaccessible without external help - now even rebels in Myanmar use them.❗️And most importantly: with this recognition and attempt to appropriate the successes of illegal armed groups, the Kiev regime is again shooting itself in the foot by signing support for HTS - a terrorist group and heir to the Syrian branch of Al-Qaeda. In fact, the Ukrainian media are again jumping on the same rake - earlier, with a similar fake story, they signed their support for international terrorism in Mali. This entailed a severance of diplomatic relations between the Sahel countries and the so-called. Ukraine. Apparently, the Kyiv regime has confidently taken a course towards forming the image of the so-called. Ukraine is like a monkey with a grenade, which does not disdain even the dirtiest deeds. We really hope that soon the Ukrainian special services will announce cooperation with someone else like this.#Syria #terrorism #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramDD Geopolitics🇺🇦🤡 Silly -Kyiv Post!- You idiots were not supposed to say the quiet part out loud!🔴 @DDGeopolitics	https://t.me/rybar/65932	2024-12-01T12:06:29-08:00
🖼 ❗️🇷🇺🇸🇾 Crisis in Syria (Aleppo province): loss of Tell Rif...	❗️🇷🇺🇸🇾 Crisis in Syria (Aleppo province): loss of Tell Rifaat by the Kurds, trophies of militants, situation towards the end of December 1, 2024 Information continues to come from the Syrian province of Aleppo about the advances of militants and the occupation of various settlements. The defense of the Syrian Arab Army and allies continues to collapse - sometimes without a shadow of resistance.▪️Both statements and footage have appeared confirming the presence of militants in Kafina. There are reports on the Internet about the capture by pro-Turkish forces of Shiite Nubbol and Az-Zahra, as well as the Kurdish canton of Tell Rifaat. The Syrian Democratic Forces are gradually losing ground, and HTS has offered the Kurds a corridor to withdraw units to Trans-Euphrates.▪️An expansion of the zone of control of the militants is also being recorded south of Aleppo. Initially, various pro-terrorist sources declared over a hundred settlements in this area, but it is obvious that all of them simply physically cannot be taken and cleared. But given the retreat from most of the villages without a fight, it’s only a matter of time.▪️The pace of advance of pro-Turkish terrorists is still gaining momentum: the militants captured the town of As-Sfira, which served as an air harbor for the Russian Armed Forces and the SAA during the war. Russian Aerospace Forces are already working on militant positions within the city. In addition, Tell Hasel, Tell Aran and the As-Sefira military factories complex are occupied (a Syrian brigadier general was captured there). Syrian generals and Russian generals are very different generals. In Syria, a brigadier general (aka senior colonel) may simply be the head of a warehouse. The number of captured Syrian military personnel is gradually gaining momentum - some are even trying to disguise themselves as women in niqabs in the best traditions of IS practices during the era of destruction.▪️In the territory of Kveiris, and in other settlements where the militants have already established stable control, the so-called Ghanima is being collected - - war trophies. The militants found a large amount of weapons, artillery and armored vehicles - they often got fully functional MLRS, which did not even bother to spend -a package - towards the attackers.▪️Not the best events are also happening in the Khanasser area: to the north, DRG activity is recorded on the section of the route from Khanasser to Rasm al-Nafi to the north, where one of the Uzbek factions operates HTS. Ambushes on retreating Syrian columns occur in the best traditions of 2016. The territory south of As-Sefira is gradually coming under the control of militants. Since tactically important heights surrender without a fight, if the militants gain a foothold, it will be extremely difficult to turn everything back. It is still difficult to predict where exactly the line of combat contact in Aleppo will be. The militants are wisely using the shortcomings and failures of the Syrian authorities: generators were promptly brought in from Turkey and light appeared in Aleppo, which was previously only provided for two hours a day. From the point of view of the common man, the thesis - the refrigerator always beats the TV - seems as clear and simple as possible. If the militants do not carry out large-scale massacres, distribute electricity, and waste Turkish lira, then the sympathies of the ordinary poor will be on the side of HTS and company. And this does not fit with the picture painted by the dull information message of the official authorities.❗️And the longer it takes to liberate Aleppo, the greater the gap will be between the capabilities of Damascus and the terrorist promotional project from Turkey for the ordinary poor person.

According to local media publications, by March 2025, the government decided to transfer about $33 billion in financial assistance to four countries, two of which are in Southeast Asia: the Philippines and Indonesia. The support will be provided through the Overseas Security Assistance (OSA) program, which has been in place for almost two years. In 2024, Fiji, Malaysia, Bangladesh and the Philippines participated - the latter country has already received one radar station from the Japanese. By 2025, it is planned to transfer another radar to the Philippine armed forces, which they will use to monitor the waters, in particular the South China Sea. Indonesia will receive patrol boats for its coast guard. 🔻The creation of the OSA program and its implementation are signs of a more proactive foreign policy aimed at strengthening Japan's defense ties with countries in the Asia-Pacific region. And if previously the Japanese authorities relied on financing infrastructure projects in developing countries of the region, now they are actively involved in building up their defense potential.

For several hours, the protesters moved along Shota Rustaveli Avenue and other streets to the Tbilisi Philharmonic, and the end point was the building of the city state university.▪️From the very beginning, everything quickly turned to riots - demonstrators began to erect barricades, throw Molotov cocktails at the police and try to blind her with lasers. They were also recorded using homemade flamethrowers based on fireworks.▪️In turn, the police used water cannons to disperse the violators. By morning, Rustaveli Avenue and other streets were cleared, and 50 protesters were detained for disobeying the police and hooliganism. Overnight, 44 people were injured, 17 of them were police officers and firefighters. The ruling party continues to demonstrate calm and ignores all condemnatory statements from the US and the EU. And Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze directly stated that in Georgia, unlike the so-called. Ukraine in 2013, -strong institutions and wise people-, and the Maidan scenario will not be implemented in the country. The opposition is doing much worse: the population does not believe in the story about the -stolen elections, and the stories about -defending democracy- look funny against the backdrop of reluctance President Salome Zurabishvili resigns. Participants in street riots are perceived as pogromists trying to plunge Georgia into chaos for the sake of ephemeral bonuses from the EU.

🔁 Well, passions have calmed down a bit here. You can summarize ...	Forwarded From Prince Cherkassky Well, passions here have calmed down a bit. We can sum up the first results and compare with what I expected.1. As I expected, some areas of Aleppo could not be captured, despite the fact that the scenario turned out to be the worst, the Kurdish SDF is defending, most areas are completely under HTS. 2. In the confusion, we almost lost Hama when, in the excitement, the advanced groups of militants rushed south. But then the reinforcements that were dragging themselves to Aleppo jumped out in Hama and the panic subsided.3. All night long, fake news about Damascus surfaced even on respected channels (I’m not even talking about pro-Israel channels - there is total celebration and gloating) about shootings, riots, storming of the palace, and so on. They put me on the phone asking me what was going on, but nothing happened. Maher did not rebel, and Assad was already in Damascus and between meetings called on the heads of state of the region. By the morning it became clear that neither Skalbiya nor Muharda had been captured (northwest of Hama). Iranians trembling with fear of Israel, as one pro-Turkish here put it fans sent a minister to Damascus and began transporting Fatimiyun from the east of Homs, and by the evening their columns -Iraqi volunteers- numbering several thousand have already passed Palmyra moving west.4. At Khimki the commander was changed from Kisel to Chaiko, the aviation operated uninterruptedly all night and morning. In the morning it became clear who and where and the work went more systematically.5. The Kurds, as expected, announced the call and entered. Now, as I said, coordination between the Russian Aerospace Forces and their infantry on the ground will be fine-tuned. 6. Almost all regional leaders, and even the League of Arab States expressed support for Assad, condemned HTS, which had never been seen before. The bottom line is that most of Aleppo province is occupied by militants, but a collapse was avoided and a new conditional front line emerged. I expect the traditional butting and a difficult new liberation of long-suffering Aleppo, only this time everything will be worse and they will no longer be transported by buses to Idlib. I repeat, potentially on the plus side - the Kurds, if they continue to use the opportunity, the pro-Iranians, of whom there will now be many times more, well and the terrorist HTS, which has acquired a huge city, which may one of these days be in danger of collapse.	https://t.me/rybar/65926	2024-12-01T07:45:06-08:00

The other day, a representative of the ruling coalition hinted that this year politicians may once again fail to make a concrete decision on tax increases. When former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced a massive increase in military spending in 2022, the government said citizens would pay for it. Then the authorities announced plans to increase taxes on personal income, corporate profits, as well as excise taxes on tobacco products. 🔻And although the Japanese support increasing the military budget due to the unstable situation in the world, they do not want to pay for it out of their own pocket. Surveys show that raising taxes is extremely unpopular among the population. Therefore, concrete decisions on this issue are postponed from 2022. The past parliamentary elections also did not provide any clarity to the situation. The ruling coalition, consisting of the Liberal Democratic Party and the Komeito Party, is now in the minority, which is why it will not be able to take such measures without lengthy negotiations with other parties. 📌 Another difficulty is related to the upcoming inauguration of Donald Trump. Tokyo suspects that, just as during the last presidency, it will stick to increasing the military spending of its American allies. The Japanese government is afraid of finding itself in a situation where both the Americans and local voters will put pressure on them. Of course, in addition to increasing taxes, the military budget can be replenished in other ways, such as using gold and foreign exchange reserves. However, this is only a temporary solution, so the future of grandiose plans to bring defense spending to the level of NATO countries is still not entirely clear. #Japan @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport us The Japan Times help cover rising defense spending may be delayed again, a senior ruling coalition official has said.	https://t.me/rybar/65924	2024-12-01T06:25:24-08:00

🇺🇦 The Western press continues to dwell on the topic of the so-...	🇺🇦 The Western press continues to dwell on the topic of the so-called problems. Ukraine with manpower. This time, the Financial Times reports that over the course of a year, the prosecutor's office of the Kyiv regime opened 60 thousand criminal cases for desertion in the Armed Forces of Ukraine - more than in the previous two years combined. The authors of the material refer to representatives of the 123rd OMBR: according to them, during After the October assault on Ugledar by Russian troops, several hundred members of the brigade fled home to the Nikolaev region. This contributed to the collapse of the defense and the loss of the city.🔻 The sharply increased level of desertion is not fiction and is indeed an urgent problem of the Kyiv regime. This is evidenced not only by publicly announced figures, but also by the increased activity of SBU employees trying to identify fugitives at checkpoints in the front-line zone. The reason is not only fatigue - the consequences are already being felt here - busification - with the recruitment of personnel comes through kidnapping people from the streets. The motivation of such recruits is low, and they desert not only from the front line, but even during training at foreign training grounds. However, such problems do not indicate the exhaustion of the mobilization potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, much less a total shortage of manpower. As we recently wrote, several Ukrainian brigades are now being trained, which are fully equipped for the announced new counter-offensive.📌 And we should not forget to learn from the mistakes of others - the same fatigue of personnel from three years of intense combat operations accumulates not only in Ukrainian formations, especially if it is also artificially aggravated by other factors.#Ukraine@rybarSupport usFtUkraine struggles to recruit new soldiers as desertions riseProsecutors opened 60,000 cases against troops abandoning positions in 2024 — almost double number of past two years	https://t.me/rybar/65918	2024-12-01T03:34:06-08:00

A whole range of mistakes and incorrect approaches to working in the territory aggravated already intractable local problems. And if many have already discussed the parallels with lessons that need to be learned and not repeated in the context of the Northern Military District, then it is important not to forget about the closer example of the contingents that ensure security in Africa. Still, there are problems with the reluctance of local armies to fight, the collapse of the economy and -relaxed- after the victory over the armed formations, they concern not only Syria, but also other borders.▪️In Mali, everyone who knows the slightest bit about the topic, notice that the armed forces run away at every opportunity. But this does not happen only in conditions when there are Russian specialists at a military post, or if the UAV delivered the first blow to the attackers. Offensive actions of government forces also never happen without the support of the Wagner PMC. One has only to remember the capture of the militant stronghold in the north - the city of Kidal, which the Malians have not controlled since 2012.▪️This is due to the fact that all the work to preserve statehood has always lay on the shoulders not of the national army, but of external actors, which were until 2022 French. Local pro-government militias in this regard have more motivation to defend their lands. In addition to this, there is a decline in the prestige of military service in the country. Young people are trying to become police officers, because through corruption they can ensure a relatively comfortable life for their family. At this time, pittance salaries for military personnel, disgusting rations and, of course, frequent losses do not increase the flow of recruits.▪️Difficulties arise with the preparation and training of local armies. Extremely limited training does not bear fruit, due to the lack of staff officers. Small groups of trained military personnel often evaporate. An infantry regiment can easily mix trained artillerymen and driver mechanics, and then send them to a forward post. There is nothing to talk about interaction in such formations. Having added up all these factors, the following picture emerges: in the event of our leaving or reducing our presence, there is always a possibility that the country’s armed forces will calmly surrender almost the entire territory to local radicals or separatists. After all, they have never dealt with internal threats on their own.❗️Therefore, without a sustainable economic and political presence, preparation of the national army and security forces to respond to any possible threats, participation in broad reform of the security system and a full-scale personnel training program, as well as supplies of modern equipment and weapons , all our efforts in the Sahel could go down the drain. Let’s hope that the intensification of work in the last year to increase the investment attractiveness of the Sahel three countries and knock out preferences for Russian companies is a sign of understanding of the current situation and a step towards correcting it.#Africa #Mali #Syria #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar❗️🇷🇺🇸🇾 The crisis in Syria: a tale of unlearned lessons and walking on a rakeThe collapse of the front in the province of Aleppo was caused by many factors.

The American press continues to publish alarmist forecasts regarding the future cabinet of Donald Trump almost every week. This time, The Economist rolled out an article about the prospects for the American intelligence community after the inauguration of the newly elected president. In short, the National Intelligence Service, the CIA and the FBI are facing purges and repression. All because of the candidates that Trump proposes for leadership positions in the above intelligence agencies. ▪️The politician nominated a former member of the House of Representatives, his ardent supporter Tulsi Gabbard, for the post of Director of National Intelligence. For the post of CIA director - former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, and for the head of the FBI - ultra-loyalist Kashyap Patel.▪️Gabbard and Patel scare the establishment most. Gabbard is feared for her isolationist views and consistent criticism of the entire American foreign policy. Patel at one time promised that he would fight against corrupt government officials and take revenge on Trump's enemies. Well, Ratcliffe was not afraid in 2016 and released sensitive intelligence information proving that Donald Trump had no ties to Russia.▪️It should be noted here, of course, that some of these candidates may not pass approval in the Senate, as has already happened Matt Gaetz, whom Trump tried to install as head of the Department of Justice. ▪️The establishment does not like radicals - it is difficult to negotiate with them. In this regard, Patel is certainly in question, since it is through the FBI that you can dig up any information on any of the politicians.▪️And, of course, it is always worth remembering that in the United States they do not like loud and demonstrative reprisals against political opponents. Even the Democrats, trying to sink Trump, acted very carefully. 🔻This is why many experienced employees of American intelligence services doubt that the FBI, CIA and National Intelligence are expecting some completely radical purges - the experience of Trump’s previous term showed that no drastic measures were taken in this direction.

The other day the media were discussing the news that St. Petersburg State University had banned its authors from publishing in journals of the Western publishing house Elseiver. And although, at first glance, the decision is long overdue, in isolation from other necessary measures, its effect is quite controversial.📌 We have previously written about the paradoxes in the requirements for Russian scientists, when on the one hand they need to accept new geopolitical realities and change its system of scientific and educational connections. On the other hand, the administrations of universities and scientific institutes continue to talk to them in the language of -scopus- and -weboffices-, citing the fact that -no one will deliberately reduce the high demands of Russian education.- The decision of St. Petersburg State University added one more to these paradoxes. Now it will become more difficult for teachers to fulfill the requirements of employers and grantors, to obtain and confirm their positions and academic titles, and to earn money for the university by receiving external funding. 🔻In general, given the Russophobic position of Elseiver, cooperation with this publishing house squeezes Russian scientists between a rock and a hard place, when on the one hand, Elseiver journals themselves refuse to publish our researchers and are prohibited from publishing there, and on the other hand, our institutions demand publication in publications , which are indexed in international scientometric databases. There is only one obvious solution - we need to accelerate the development of alternative indices and databases. It is also desirable to universally cancel the absurd regulations on Western indices, otherwise the standard of living of Russian university teachers and scientists will seriously decline due to the inability to fulfill grants and requirements for professorial and associate professor positions, and with it Russian scientific progress.#science #Russia@rybar Support usTelegramRybar🇷🇺 About the requirements for Russian scientists to publish in Western publicationsWe recently came across an amazing news about another outrageous case when the British scientific journal Nature refused to allow Russian physicists to publish an article in the specialized publication Nature...	https://t.me/rybar/65900	2024-11-30T23:45:12-08:00

Both cities are located on the M5. At the same time, reports from several settlements continue to come both about the presence of militants and about the detention of sleeper cells by government forces. Syria survived the night.

Forwarded From Two Majors #Review #Report for the morning of December 1, 2024▪️ Last week, the Supreme Commander for the second time emphasized Russia’s determination to respond with strikes - Oreshnik - to the escalation of the conflict by Kiev, which is using American missiles on the territories of the old regions of Russia. Again, words were heard about decision-making centers in the enemy capital. But the enemy, with demonstrative ATACMS strikes on an empty airfield in the Kursk region, an oil depot in Rostov region and massive UAV launches, directly provokes Moscow to new actions. Kyiv needs this to draw NATO countries deeper into the orbit of war and justify defense failures at the front. Russia this week defeated many energy facilities in Ukraine, causing massive power outages, which also did not bring Zelensky to his senses.▪️ At the end of the week, news from distant Syria about multiple terrorist breakthroughs in the direction of the cities of Aleppo and Hama, flight from the positions of the Syrian Arab Army caused many analogies with mistakes of our military machine in difficult moments of the Northern Military District, which we still manage to get rid of. The reasons on the network are cited as unreliable information from the Center about the true state of affairs, the sending of generals to Syria in an -honorable exile- and excessively partnership relations with the relaxed Syrian military instead of taking them into a tight rein. After Moscow’s decisive actions of a military, personnel and political nature, by nightfall news began to arrive about the stabilization of the situation and the arrival of additional government troops in crisis areas.▪️ In Ukraine, the Russian Army continues to solve the most difficult task of exhausting and destroying the enemy’s military machine. Indicators of its wear and tear are the reduction in time periods between tactical crises in the defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and multiple political statements by Kyiv about the need to lower the mobilization age to 18 years with reference to the demands of Western countries. Zelensky’s lamentations continue regarding the receipt of ever-increasing volumes of military-technical assistance from NATO. At the same time, the enemy command retains up to several brigades in reserve and declares its readiness to conduct a new counter-offensive. At the same time, the most politically beneficial for Zelensky may be a repetition of the Kursk adventure in the hope of reaching the negotiations he desires with a new subject of bargaining and creating internal political tension in Russia. It should be noted that information about the concentration of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the regions bordering Russia has already been reported and our missiles and FAB with UMPC are already operating at the places where the Armed Forces are concentrated in the same Sumy region.▪️ At the front, the Russian Army retains the initiative. In the Kursk region, heavy bloody battles continue with our tactical successes. The Ukrainian Armed Forces maintain the most combat-ready group of forces in the region and Sumy region and actively use mercenaries from among former NATO military personnel. The enemy, following the political will of Zelensky, does not agree to a reasonable reduction of the front line to tighten its defense, pins down our troops in battles and holds on to positions in maneuverable defense, losing precious armored vehicles.▪️ The Kharkov, Kupyansk and Krasnolimansky directions are characterized by the tactical successes of the Russian Armed Forces. There are heavy battles going on. In Toretsk (Dzerzhinsk) and Chasov Yar, our troops are gnawing out enemy positions house by house. At the same time, in Chasov Yar, Russian forces approached the enemy’s stronghold of defense in a fireproof plant.

The Russian delegation also included representatives of business and security circles.▪️In Mali, Novak held talks with the country's transitional president Assimi Goita and the newly appointed prime minister. The parties discussed trade and economic cooperation, interaction in the field of energy and mining. The latter is especially relevant, given that at the end of September the Malian Minister of Economy announced the possible joint production of lithium in the country. And in the summer, news appeared about possible cooperation between Mali and Rosatom. Security officials led by Yunus-Bek Evkurov discussed the deployment of the African Corps in the country for the purpose of training Malian military personnel. True, while the Wagner PMC is operating in the country, resolving this issue will still take time.▪️After Mali, Novak arrived in Burkina Faso, where he and the Prime Minister discussed mechanisms of cooperation in the international arena. Also, security officials as part of the delegation raised the issue of placing the Russian military attaché in the country.▪️The last country on the tour was Niger. In Niamey, negotiations took place with the head of the Republic and the Prime Minister, where issues of practical cooperation in the field of energy and geological exploration and development of mineral reserves were also touched upon. This is especially important against the background of the French withdrawal from uranium deposits and the arrival in their place of Rosatom, whose representatives also were part of the delegation.🔻The visit of not only diplomatic and security, but also economic mediators in relations between countries is an important step in strengthening ties with sovereign authorities of the Sahel. Using the example of the Central African Republic, we have already seen how our military efforts, separated from the economy, do not give the desired result.

We have already plotted all the main events of the day on the online map map .rybar.ru. At the same time, the new zones of control will most likely become clear in the morning. The sharp advance of anti-government formations requires the militants to competently distribution of their forces across various sectors of the front, which over the past few days has noticeably expanded in several provinces at once.🔻The main events of the Syrian conflict unfolded in the province of Hama: illegal armed groups effortlessly occupied several settlements, and their advanced detachments entered the northern part of the city Hama, having established his presence there. The pro-government media immediately convinces that the situation here is under control: more and more units of the SAR Armed Forces are arriving in the city, and the expected will begin soon counter-offensive, -you just have to wait-. However, many of the images coming from there are often irrelevant.🔻No information was received about the fighting in Idlib province. This may be due to the fact that most of the region is occupied by the terrorist organization Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and other groups. Periodically, the positions of illegal armed groups in occupied cities were attacked by the Russian Aerospace Forces and the Syrian Air Force. In the province of Aleppo, fighting is taking place east of the administrative center in the form of the city of the same name: there, pro-Turkish groups from the Syrian National Army (SNA) association began their ground operation - Dawn freedom, during which they occupied Tadif and the Kwaires airbase. At the same time, the Kurdish enclave in Tell Rifaat and its surroundings - the so-called Al-Shahba Canton - remain largely untouched. Clashes periodically broke out between SNA factions and Kurdish militias, but they did not lead to significant changes. A somewhat similar situation persists in the northern part of the city of Aleppo, where the Al-Sheikh Maqsoud quarter is under the control of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). While the jihadists are in no hurry to take on it, to a certain extent they do not want to get involved with the Women's Protection Units (YPJ).#Aleppo #digest #Idlib #Syria@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65895	2024-11-30T14:12:29-08:00

If in the next 24 hours the situation for the SAA in the Hama area remains stable, then things will be a little easier. It seems that the militants did not have just a few hours to occupy the empty city before the SAA columns began to enter there. In fact, the video of militants entering the northeastern regions of Hama and the video of SAA columns in the south of Hama appeared almost simultaneously. The militants decided not to engage in battle and their mobile groups retreated to the north, where their control in the north of the province is still quite shaky. But it is worth considering that having taken large trophies in Aleppo, they can soon begin to move captured tanks, armored fighting vehicles and artillery to new directions, increasing pressure.	https://t.me/rybar/65894	2024-11-30T12:24:57-08:00

This once again proves that the 5 DShK project turned out to be unviable - alas, to Russian military advisers failed to bring to fruition the project of General Alekseev, which was ingenious for its time (the Syrians themselves refused recognize those who have reconciled as full members of society, but Russian administrative resources were clearly not enough).📌We wrote all this in October.

In Damascus, meanwhile, civil strife began: the Republican Guard clashed with the 4th division of Maher Assad, the president’s brother. Official state television stopped broadcasting. UPD: What was passed off as civil strife turned out to be... 🇸🇾 Syrian troops actually entered the southern quarters of Hama.&nbsp; At the same time, the presence of militants was recorded in the north and central regions. Therefore, the situation resembles that layer cake - especially in conditions of panic and lack of communication. To the south of Hama in the vicinity of Homs (in the long-suffering reconciled Er-Rastan and Telbis), sleeper cells have become active, which have both weapons and flags of the Syrian revolution (never before it wasn’t and here it is again). 📌It is extremely premature to talk about stabilizing the situation in Hama. While the hastily assembled Syrian troops are marching in one direction, the militants are simply bypassing them along the rocky roads. If we add here the large-scale activity of the DRG and the psyops of the militants, the picture is extremely bad.

International support measures for the government of Bashar al-Assad are gaining momentum. First, rumors about Iran’s military operation in Syria (there will be a gift for Israel, of course), now Iraqi Prime Minister Muhammad Shia -Sudani announced Iraq’s readiness to provide full assistance to Damascus. At the same time, he Assad was indeed in Moscow and held negotiations with Vladimir Putin. What was agreed upon is unknown, but now it is extremely clear that it is impossible (and indeed impossible) to limit ourselves only to measures of a military nature. We need to work politically. And what they can agree on, given that the Turks are not trusted, is still terra incognita. However, if Russia once again acts as a savior, our country probably needs to take full control of Syria. With bringing order to corrupt security forces. With a complete reshaping of the Syrian economy. But whether they will take up this task is unclear. ❗️The problem of Syria is, first of all, Syria itself and its government, its elites. Without influencing them and reshaping them - no matter how hard the military tries - the situation will repeat itself later. #Iraq #Iran #Russia #Syria@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65890	2024-11-30T11:45:56-08:00

But the Turks in this whole connection are a bargaining chip. All they were promised was a carrot to convince them of the reality of the situation. But one should not think that Türkiye has the will and influence. The entire history of Turkey and the Ottoman Empire before it is the role of a tool. The Anglo-Saxons are currently doing everything to leave smoke with a lot of soot behind them. This can be seen in actions within the United States, in policy towards Ukraine and in the situation in the Middle East, from which the United States plans to withdraw soon. But they won’t leave heaven and grace?♦️What are the consequences of all this? What happens during any war and catastrophic events? Mass exodus of the population. Given how quickly the militants are moving and the ferocity with which they are slaughtering the Syrian population in villages and towns, the pace of civilian flight will accelerate. That is, in fact, in a few years, there will be new waves of refugees from Syria. Where will they run? First, they will rush to nearby countries, such as Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, but this will only be a temporary point, since there is no stability there that they dream of.❗️The final destination, of course, will be Europe. They shouldn’t run to Africa. First on this list will be Italy. A funny coincidence is the return of the Italian ambassador to Damascus to solve the migration problem on the eve of the events in Aleppo. Next in line will be Greece, Romania, France, Germany and so on in order. Great Britain stands out in Europe because there is a water barrier between the country and Europe, but they too have prepared in advance. A few days ago, an agreement was concluded between Iraq and the UK to combat groups illegally transporting people to Britain. Countries affected by the crisis in Syria were the first to begin to worry. And the Turks will actively contribute to all this, sending thousands of refugees to Old Europe, where the migration and crime situation is on the verge of collapse. ♦️This situation will further affect the plight of Europe as part of its targeted destruction. The collapse of the economy and industrial complex, the cutting off of gas pipelines and submarine cables, coupled with incompetent authorities - and here is a new wave of migrants. It turns out that the Middle East has been a powder keg for thousands of years. If you remember, there has never been peace in the Middle East. Well, Europe faces an extremely sad development of the situation, since in the wake of what is happening in Syria, a catastrophe awaits Europe.

Forwarded From Global Studies🇷🇺🇸🇾🇹🇷 On the importance of Syrian events, local consequences - part 1 The pace of change in the situation in Syria is so high that while you are writing a post, the Syrians are losing several settlements. Now Hama is on the verge of falling, which will be followed by more than one large city in this situation. But it is important to understand why all this happened and how it will affect the situation in the world. The consequences of what is happening now in Syria can be divided into local and global. Let's start with the local ones.➖The strike on Aleppo was delivered in a very timely manner. Those who planned the attack and were behind it (and these are not the Turks) chose the right moment in time when the Syrian army completely lost its potential, drowning in bureaucracy.➖The Russian contingent also lost its grip due to the same systemic problems in the form of dominance not combat training, but, let’s call it, educational and methodological, expressed in the dominance of headquarters, for example, the notorious schedules PCB.➖The negativity growing towards Russia in Syria reached its highest levels ever due to Israel's methodical strikes on Syrian targets that were guarded by Russian air defense systems. Inaction raised questions among the Syrians, and now they completely blame Russia for everything.♦️What happens now?▪️Syria is on fire again, and any restoration can be forgotten for an indefinite period. And all the countries nearby will suffer from the fire in Syria - Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, Turkey (yes, she too, despite the fact that she seems to be on horseback now).▪️Russia will lose its status in this country, which is on our eyes simply ceases to exist. This is a serious blow to the reputation, even though the main blame lies with the Syrian leadership and systemic problems of statehood.▪️Iran and the axis of resistance will lose their potential, which was already greatly weakened during the war in the Gaza Strip and the IDF operation in Lebanon. The remaining resources will be used to localize the fire and ensure the safety of their territories from militants.▪️In the coming weeks, perhaps even days, ISIS terrorists and the moderate opposition (read militants) will make themselves known and will also join in the celebration of chaos, which will plunge the country into a catastrophe that has not happened in past years.

In parallel with this, preparations are underway for the start of the assault on Bolshaya Novoselka, where the Russian Armed Forces are actively using various unmanned systems to destroy the defensive positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. ▪️On the eastern flank, by November 26, Russian troops started fighting in Razdolny and gained a foothold on its outskirts. At the same time, a series of attacks were carried out north and south of the village, aimed at creating additional stress points along the entire length of the area. During the battles, the Ukrainian Armed Forces were knocked out of several forest belts and previously formed pockets, which made it possible to level the front line. By November 29, Russian troops completely liberated Razdolnoye - marines of the 40th Guards Brigade raised the St. Andrew's flag in the center of the village, at the same time this was reported to the Russian Ministry of Defense.▪️Despite individual statements on the Internet, confirm the entry of Russian units into the eastern The outskirts of Bolshaya Novoselka have not been successfully explored at the moment. Probably, the goal of the command of the Russian Armed Forces is to bypass the village from the flanks with subsequent disruption of supply lines and isolation of the Ukrainian garrison. ❗️To weaken the defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the city, units of the Russian Armed Forces use both conventional UAVs and artillery, and unmanned ground systems. Recently, the use of one of them was caught on camera - a tracked drone loaded with explosives - the Mole - blew up an enemy stronghold, destroying part of the building and the personnel inside it. ▪️Significant advances of Russian troops were also recorded east of Urozhainy. Effective attacks allowed the fighters of the Russian Armed Forces to push the enemy to the north-west and gain a foothold on the achieved lines. This creates the preconditions for a further attack by attack aircraft in the direction of Blagodatnoye and the southern outskirts of Bolshaya Novoselka. ▪️On the western flank, the Russian Armed Forces are improving their tactical position in the area of ​​previously liberated Rovnopol and Novodarovka. The assault groups cleared out the pocket between the villages and expanded their zone of control. Previously, the offensive in this area was complicated by the water barrier located to the south in the Grushevataya gully. After the enemy was semi-encircled, the Russian Armed Forces launched flank attacks and occupied strongholds of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which were left without electronic warfare and UAV cover. To the west of Novodarovka, Russian troops pushed Ukrainian formations out of the ruins and reached the shore of the reservoir. 🔻After a long calm, the offensive of the Russian Armed Forces in the Vremevsky direction is developing gradually. This tactic is not the fastest, but it allows for the most effective action and at the same time avoiding unnecessary losses of personnel.

There were no large-scale skirmishes, the militants’ resources rushed to inflate everything on a universal scale. The start of the coup is not confirmed from the ground. Another question is that the Syrians’ media and their anti-crisis about everything being -under control- are doing everything to ensure that the terrorists’ resources effortlessly plunge the country into chaos with information. #Syria #terrorism@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65884	2024-11-30T10:08:23-08:00

🖼 ❗️🇸🇾🏴 Militant offensive in northwestern Syria: loss of mos...	❗️🇸🇾🏴 Militant offensive in northwestern Syria: loss of most of the province of Idlib and the city of Aleppowhat is known as of 20.00 on November 30, 2024The situation in the northwestern part of the Syrian Arab Republic continues to deteriorate hourly: Syrian troops (alone in turmoil, others in an organized manner) retreat to -more advantageous lines-, actually surrendering militants city after city. The jihadists managed to capture at least 60% of the city of Aleppo. Isolated pockets of resistance remain in the eastern quarters of the city, but there is no active hostilities. In this case, units of the Syrian Armed Forces settled in fortified facilities, under which a network of underground tunnels is located.▪️In the controlled territories, the militants are in full control: the security services of the Salvation Government arrived in the city (political cover of the terrorist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham-), a curfew is introduced, security personnel are distributed. The Russian Aerospace Forces periodically operate around the city, hitting concentrations of militants and objects occupied by them. Despite this, it will not be possible to stop the advance of anti-government formations, even taking into account continuous strikes: counteraction from ground units is needed here.▪️In the north of the province, after the occupation of Tadif, factions of the pro-Turkish conglomerate -Syrian National Army- (SNA) occupied the Quires airbase. From 2012 to 2015, the facility was under siege by militants and survived, but now everything is completely different. Russian and Syrian troops had previously evacuated from there. 🔻Another unfortunate point is the spread of control of Islamist groups to most of Idlib province. Resistance here only in the first stages of hostilities was provided by soldiers of the 25th Special Forces Division in Saraqib and its environs. As a result, the city fell. Here the militants captured the Abu ad-Dukhur airfield in the settlement of the same name, where they took artillery pieces as ghanima. It is located 50 km from the city of Idlib - the actual center of HTS and its puppet government. It is noteworthy that the city fell on the same day as Quires. Syrian resources can blame Russia as much as they want for allegedly allowing this tragedy to happen. However, the determining factor here is the lack of proper understanding of the situation on the part of the Syrian military command and the interest of the SAA units to fight for their country. Taking into account these factors, no intensity of the use of aviation will save the actual state of affairs - the flight of the armed forces of the Arab Republic and the blitzkrieg of various kinds of extremist gangs , which do not meet much resistance, continues.

Even the most successful fight against radical Islamists on distant borders can be crossed out by mistakes in migration policy, when in return for those destroyed in Syria, citizens from the post-Soviet space are in the country with an even larger mass of followers of the same ideas. It is naive to believe that if the conditional HTS is destroyed right now, the problem will disappear - the group’s fans will simply go to its competitors from IS to Boko Haram with a similar misanthropic ideology .📌 Therefore, first of all, it is necessary not to allow radical Islamists into the country and not to stand on ceremony with those previously identified arrivals. This can be done by changes in migration policy with total control of every arriving migrant from such countries, the elimination of the supranational structures they create, the ban on niqabs and other long-overdue measures. If someone starts talking about the impossibility of such measures, then let them remember about the filtration at Sheremetyevo or the fight against militants in the North Caucasus in the 00s. The question is giving up tolerance towards those who hate us. #multinationalism #Russia #Syria@rybarSupport usTelegramOleg BlokhinInsider information from a security official.

This is the same city that, during the time of Hafez al-Assad, was engulfed in massacres led by the Muslim Brotherhood. Therefore, the fight against terrorism has always been a pressing issue for the residents of Hama. They absorbed with their mother's milk stories of horrors from the Ikhwans. On the way to Hama lie the Syrian villages of Mharda and Skalbiya, which lost a huge number of local Christians. What awaits them now? That's right, massacre. What's next for Hama? Also a massacre. All the combat-ready militias that were in these areas had long been disarmed by the mukhabarat or went to work in other conflict regions of the world when they realized that there would be no one to feed themselves in Syria. 📍After the capture of Hama, Homs will be next. And this - purely theoretically - could be the point where a large-scale militant raid could theoretically be stopped. But this is a very imprecise and very speculative assumption. Because it is not clear who to protect. Where are the Syrian soldiers running, whose brothers in arms are now being shot and executed in Aleppo and Idlib? They'll probably come running somewhere. They could probably even run away to Iraq if they let them through the border. In modern history, this is probably the most shameful page in the history of a single state. The loyalists held Afghanistan much longer during the Taliban offensive. That's not how things went down in the Central African Republic in 2020.

Forwarded From Global Studies🇸🇾🇹🇷 Black Friday in Syrian There is more and more evidence of the fact that HTS militants have already reached the province of Hama, having previously announced the complete capture of the province of Idlib. At the same time, units of the Syrian National Army occupied the Kweires airbase and moved on. Logically, the situation in Aleppo has become critical, since the remaining forces there now face the prospect of being flanked. Taking into account how the militants are distributing footage of the conquered territories, the flight of the Syrians will accelerate. What is interesting now is what the Kurdish units will do, who are still in Tel Rifaat, but are actively firing at the city, which clearly suggests an imminent assault attempt settlement under the control of the SDS. But in connection with the withdrawal of the Syrians from Queires, and therefore they will most likely leave the areas to the east, sooner or later The militants will reach the Euphrates River (most likely early), which will directly confront them with the SDF, who probably understand this and are preparing accordingly. The main attention, of course, is currently focused on Hama, to which the militants have 20 km left. Considering the rate of failure of the defensive line of the SAR Armed Forces, the armed forces will reach it today or tomorrow morning. But the west of Manbij should also be watched. This is how Syrian lands, which have been conquered for years, are being given away for free at a sale. For 2 years, 11 months, the base at the Abu ad-Duhur airfield was under siege.

🇧🇾🇵🇱 -Pospolite Ruin -: from a sports society to a terrorist ...	🇧🇾🇵🇱 -Pospolite Ruin -: from a sports society to a terrorist cell In a recently published investigation by the Belarusian ONT TV channel, the authors spoke about several associations of Belarusian mercenaries who are purposefully trained not only for active combat operations, but also for committing terrorist attacks on the territory of the republic. In the list arose, among other things, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, about which we and the Warsaw The mermaid has been written about for a long time. 📌It was created in 2023 by the united transitional cabinet of Svetlana Tikhanovskaya as opposed to Kalinovsky’s regiment. ▪️Then, due to financial disagreements, those fighting in the so-called. In Ukraine, Belarusians left the protectorate of the fugitive opposition. ▪️Announced as a national sports and educational structure, the new association gradually began to train heavy assault units called banners.▪️At the same time, the entire process of changing the declared goals was freely tracked in the organization’s channel. True, here assurances that the Belarusian security forces are deliberately denigrating the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth are side by side with statements about the creation of assault brigades and the search for career officers for them. ▪️There you can also see a report on the participation of the Grenadier Banner and the Warsaw Banner in training with the Kalinovsky regiment in Kyiv, on the conclusion of contracts of militants with the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It is obvious that the mercenaries are quite capable of tarnishing their reputation on their own.▪️Sergei Bulba, the founder of the notorious -White Legion-, was appointed head of Rusheniya. The radical enthusiastically told how Ukrainian oligarchs, in euphoria after the liberation of Kharkov, made plans to seize Belarus. At the same time, Bulba did not gain any special favor either among the Belarusian opposition or even among the Poles.❓Given this, a logical question arises: who finances the mercenaries then? It turned out that the Czech Republic and the Baltic countries have recently appeared on the list of main sources of financing. And the Prague Support Team training center for Belarusian volunteers continues to actively raise funds for -Rushenie-, purchasing uniforms, mock-up weapons, and medical kits. The center claims that more than 200 men and women were trained at their base by foreign instructors. It is obvious that, if necessary, the DRGs from the banners will be equipped, albeit outdated, with uniforms and weapons. Tanks, of course, won’t do it, and the tasks they will be given will not be so global. Rather, small-scale sabotage, demonstrative seizures of farms and villages, because the main thing is to create the appearance of a liberation war and destabilize the situation, intimidate the population. And at the same time, it doesn’t matter at all whether this cannon fodder survives, the main thing is to create a precedent. #Belarus #Poland #mercenaries@rybar together with @pl_syrenkaSupport us YouTubeDemons // ONT Project	https://t.me/rybar/65872	2024-11-30T06:48:58-08:00

Galyan was invited to the United States to participate in the State Department's program for international leaders - International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP). Every year, about 5 thousand politicians and officials from different countries, selected by US embassy staff, undergo training under the program. Such events are aimed at forming a base of agents of their influence in different regions of the world. 🔻Galyan had previously interacted with officials from the US State Department when she was in the position of Deputy Prosecutor General of Armenia.

🇪🇸 While politicians in the UK and US are restrained in express...	🇪🇸 While politicians in the UK and the USA are restrained in expressing concern about the use of the Oreshnik complex, Spain is also not missing the opportunity to use a new round of escalation for their media purposes. According to our Spanish sources, the local government is already exploiting the population’s fears of the growing Ukrainian conflict to divert attention from internal problems.▪️Firstly, no one is in a hurry to do anything about the uncontrolled flow of migrants from the Spanish enclaves on the North African coast - Ceuta and Melilla, as well as separatist sentiments in these cities. A few days ago, members of the Coordination Committee for the Liberation of Ceuta and Melilla, an organization that existed in 2007-2014, made their presence known. A recent meeting of the 98 member organizations of the committee took place in Beni Ansar in Morocco, and Moroccan activist Abdelhamid Aaquid nominated himself for the post of head . Although he later stated that he was not going to head the committee, it is possible that this time the irredentists will seek not so much the independence of the enclaves as they will lobby for the interests of Muslims.▪️Secondly, the current Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez regularly finds himself at the center of corruption scandals: either in connection with the entrepreneurial activities of his wife, or because of the likely misuse of budget funds allocated to help flood victims.🔻 Therefore, for so that the Spaniards do not have time to express dissatisfaction with the work of the government, the media are already telling them about a possible upcoming global conflict and recommend finding out where the nearest bunker is located. However, we have been observing all this for a long time: the power in Spain is changing, and under the slogans about -Russian threat - money is steadily going where it needs to go. So if Spanish politicians make any statements, they will be in full accordance with the narratives of London and Washington.#Spain@rybarSupport usLa RazónSe constituye en Marruecos un -Comité para la liberación de Ceuta y Melilla-Esta integrado por 98 asociaciones y será presidido por Abdelhamid Aakid	https://t.me/rybar/65866	2024-11-30T03:43:58-08:00

🔁 🇷🇸 Kosovo and Metohija: one step away from war. I’ll update ...	Forwarded From Serbian Herald🇷🇸 Kosovo and Metohija: one step away from war. I will complement Comrade Rybar’s post on the situation in Kosovo. Yesterday evening there was a powerful explosion in the north. As a result of the collapse of the water canal wall, the supply of water to Kosovo Mitrovica was stopped, Pristina and its surroundings were left without electricity, the same water is used to cool the Obilic A and B thermal power plants. ❗️ Peacekeepers from KFOR and EULEX almost immediately arrived at the scene of the incident. One of the first were the Americans, who were gathering large forces to the north. Why they did not react promptly yesterday in Gracanica, during the massive Albanian provocation, I think is understandable. 📌 It is also clear that this was another -false flag operation-. Over the past few days, explosions have been heard in northern Kosovo. But since this did not have the desired effect, Pristina decided to organize something larger in order to set in motion plans to capture the north of the region. ▪️ Armed militants have already begun terrorizing the Serbian population. One person has already been arrested. The house of another -accidentally- was broken into by -special forces-. Raids in the north of Kosmet, where 95% of the population are Serbs, continue. While I was writing the text, another Serb was detained at the Yarinje checkpoint.▪️ Moreover, special forces and Kosovo security forces were spotted at the scene, which: 1) do not have the right to exist under UN Resolution 1244 and 2) do not have the right to appear in the north of the region without the approval of the Serbs and KFOR. As we can see, the latter clearly have approval, but after the forceful seizure of municipal buildings, the opinion of the former is not even taken into account. ▪️ The prompt reaction of the West and the found culprits in the person of Serbia and Russia make it clear who benefits from the new escalation in Kosmet. Serbian politicians from Kosmet denied the participation of the Serbs in such a provocation, since it is simply unprofitable for the Serbs - the largest settlement. in the north was left without water. ❗️ But for our dear partners, everything immediately became clear. First, the Kosovo president accused Serbia of the terrorist attack, and then found a Russian trace. The Kosovo Security Council spoke similarly. ▪️ As a colleague correctly writes, the era of highly likely has not gone anywhere. Further in her words: -The British Ambassador to Kosovo called for an investigation into the incident and to identify its organizers, the US Ambassador strongly condemned the attack, and those responsible for the attack on the legitimate authorities of Kosovo should be brought to justice as soon as possible. The EU has already volunteered to help Pristina investigate the incident. ▪️ One more thing, colleagues from the About Serbia channel in Russian ask a very correct question: why is Foreign Minister Marko Djuric making excuses for the incident in Kosovo and generally commenting on it, and not the Ministry of Internal Affairs?❗️ In the whole situation in Kosovo, you need to understand that the West is actively militarizing -Kosovo- and regularly increases its KFOR contingent in the region - four times a year. Turkey remains the main sponsor of the militants, and the collective West will help Kosovo produce weapons and drones.‼️ We must also not forget that Kosovo recently became an associate member of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly - this is the highest status before joining NATO. 📌 Despite all of the above, Kosovo Albanians are very afraid of escalation in the north of Kosovo and the reaction of the Serbian Armed Forces, which has about 50 military bases along the perimeter of the region for rapid response. In this regard, in the north of Kosovo over the past two years, new bases for the Kosovo security forces have been actively built, and KFOR bases have also been expanded. ▪️ Pristina’s plan is extremely simple: to seize by force the north of Kosmet, where 95% of the population are Serbs. In this regard, daily terror and aggressive Albanization continue in order to force the maximum number of Serbs to leave the region, so that it would be easier for illegal paramilitary groups to enter the north at the right time. And the right moment will come when the embassies of the USA and Great Britain say, without which not a single decision is made. And yes, the fact that the crisis in Kosovo and Metohija has intensified now, in parallel with Syria, Georgia, Moldova and the retiring Biden, is clearly not an accident. #Serbia #Kosovo@vestniksrb - the main thing about Serbia and the BalkansTelegramRybar🇷🇸 New crisis in Kosovo and Metohija?

After small night skirmishes with Syrian troops (whose command assured that they managed to push back the militants), anti-government formations expanded control zone in central Aleppo. The militants also had success in the east of Idlib. Footage of what is happening near the Aleppo Citadel has surfaced on the Internet, showing how inspired members of the terrorist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and the pro-Turkish conglomerate Syrian National Army flaunt against the background of cultural objects ( SNA).The citadel was considered for a long time to be somewhat impregnable a fortress, which, according to the Syrians, the militants certainly cannot take. However, they miscalculated - at night this territory fell almost without a single shot. And now the green flag of the moderate opposition proudly hangs there.▪️In connection with the ongoing collapse of the defense of the Syrian Arab Army, the work of the Russian Aerospace Forces on jihadist targets in the city was recorded. However, the strikes are single in nature. However, if the raids are continuous, it will be impossible to do without the actions of ground forces.▪️Meanwhile, in the north of Aleppo province, a second front, as expected, has opened, but not against the Kurds: Turkish-backed SNA groups (Faylaq al-Sham and Firqat al-Sultan Murad -) attacked the positions of government troops in the city of Tadif, declaring its complete capture. Even if the information is true, it’s not surprising this is not the case - not only the reluctance of the SAR Armed Forces units to defend the state system played a role. The settlement is located on the line of contact, which is why actual control was not clear before.❗️From Tadif, pro-Turkish formations can either launch an attack on the north of Aleppo or try to capture the Russian-Syrian airbase of Quires, located east of the administrative center of the province. Both options pose a danger to the further defense capability of the Syrian Armed Forces. In the east of Idlib province, the militants also had success: from the footage that appeared, it was possible to establish that anti-government forces not only occupied the city of Saraqib, but also advanced east to Kafr Amim. Armored vehicles were seen in its vicinity, but the settlement itself is under the control of Syrian troops. Against the backdrop of the militants’ offensive on Aleppo, reports also appeared that areas of the city and some settlements to the north, which were abandoned by units of the Syrian Armed Forces, came under the control of the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces. However, so far no footage has appeared on the Internet confirming this information.

As a result of the collapse of the water canal wall, the water supply to Kosovska Mitrovica was stopped, Pristina and its surroundings were left without electricity. The regional water supply company is urging area residents to stock up on drinking water. ▪️ The prime minister of the self-proclaimed republic addressed citizens at 11:30 p.m., calling the incident a terrorist act and blaming the Serbian authorities and their proxies. According to Albin Kurti, the explosion of the water utility was carried out by professionals and was aimed at critical infrastructure. ▪️ The British Ambassador to Kosovo called for an investigation into the incident and identification of the organizers, the United States strongly condemned the attack and called for the perpetrators to be brought to justice as soon as possible. At the same time, the leader of the Serb party in Kosovo emphasizes that as a result of the destruction of the water canal, the supply of water and electricity to the north of Kosovo, where the Serbs live, has been disrupted. According to him, the explosion is absolutely contrary to the interests of the Serbian people.

Situation for September 27 - November 29, 2024 A series of attacks in the north-west of the country in September led to response measures by government forces. ▪️Over the past two months, positions along the Cameroonian border have been significantly strengthened. Many operations have also been carried out to track down and neutralize militants in the border zone. During these raids, over 60 bandits from the 3R group were eliminated.▪️In the central part of the country, militants from the UPC continued terrorizing the Christian population. On November 25, they killed seven local Christians who were heading from a community gathering.❗️In addition, the militants organized an ambush on a convoy of government forces in the village. Tagbara. Having repelled the attack, Russian specialists found a phone from one of the attackers. In the photographs provided by colleagues from the @ZOV_Jumanji channel, new details were found of the attack on Chinese businessmen last spring. Thus, one of the frames was filmed by the bandit immediately after the terrorist attack committed by the militants, after which he ended up in the French-controlled media Corbeau News. This is where the fake story about the involvement of Russian instructors in the attack came from.▪️Other photographs where the militant was captured in military uniform, clearly not on the territory of the Central African Republic, are also noteworthy, once again confirming the information that the attackers were trained abroad.▪️A major success for the central authorities began to lift restrictions on the export of diamonds. As a result of the work of the Wagner PMC to liberate the country, the balance of power changed and the Gulf monarchies chose leadership in Bangui. ▪️The establishment of relations between CAR President Touadera and Paris continues.

A completely different question is that HTS will try to legalize itself by hook or by crook.▪️Moreover, this is a project that is consistently promoted in the West, because in this way they want to put terrorist organizations on an equal footing with other structures. If, for example, the case of the same Taliban can very conditionally be cited as an example by which one could try to legalize HTS, then in this case this example will still be somewhat incorrect. HTS is not the Taliban, which came to power and consists of people from the tribes inhabiting Afghanistan. ▪️HTS are bandits and outright beasts, who are now on Turkey’s payroll, have been imbued with absolutely Turkish ideology and are profiting from openly terrorist acts. Moreover, quasi-state structures, no matter how they are twisted or called, today are, in fact, a racketeering scheme for the long-suffering Idlib Reserve. 🔻Therefore, this story about the fact that HTS wants to negotiate with absolutely everyone and Russia should be perceived primarily with fear in our country. So that some bright minds in high offices do not get into their heads the thought: - maybe it will happen to them agree better and easier than with others. No, it’s not easier, because this is a bomb planted under the entire region. These are the people who slaughter Shiites and openly mock the history and civilization of Syria. And if you just try to look in this direction, all cooperation with Iran, and Syria, and many of our other allies who helped Russia during the Northeast Military District will be crossed out. 📍Although we are sure that Turkish agents are not asleep (like British lobbyists). And they will promote the point of view that since the government of Bashar al-Assad now cannot stay in power, then it will supposedly be better for Russia to come to an agreement with HTS.

This radical blogger has been in Syria since 2016, serving the interests of -Hayat Tahrir al-Sham- and speaking as a person who sells a Central Asian face to attract citizens of the post-Soviet space to the ranks of HTS. He accompanied all the main events of HTS, sometimes giving hilarious reports, and after a long pause he returned again to film the activities of HTS. He had already been killed several times, and he managed to work with the Ukrainian media before the SVO. A certain charisma and popularization of life as part of a terrorist group, especially at the dawn of HTS, really played an important role in attracting representatives of the Central Asian republics. He is like a cockroach that survived in different situations. But now the influx has become smaller, largely due to the active internal policies of the leaderships of the countries in the region, who are trying to cut out the notes of extremism at the root.

🖼 🇬🇧🇰🇬 About the interest of British corporations in Kyrgyz ...	🇬🇧🇰🇬 About the interest of British corporations in Kyrgyz uranium An interesting meeting remained without much public attention in Kyrgyzstan. On November 18, the Prime Minister of Kyrgyzstan held a meeting with the British Ambassador Nicholas Bowler regarding a project to develop the critical minerals industry. Representatives of the consulting company Boston Consulting Group (BCG) were also present at the meeting. This is a large American company that helps in matters of business management and development. And she has repeatedly found herself in scandals, including those related to the illegal extraction of natural resources.🔻Why did we mention minerals and what does the British ambassador have to do with it? Over the past year, news about the future of the Kyzyl-Ompol deposit near Lake Issyk has not ceased in Kyrgyz resources. Kul. Various resources are stored in its depths, the largest of which is titanomagnetite. But there are also uranium reserves there. It is the uranium deposits that are of greatest interest to British investors. In February of this year, a member of the board of the Rotschild&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Co&nbsp;Ariel Malar de&nbsp;Rothschild visited Kyrgyzstan. And the key issue of discussion was investment in the mining industry of Kyrgyzstan. At the same time, the Rothschild family turned its attention to Kyrgyz resources last fall. Then they first started talking about Kyrgyz uranium. Why did the British pay attention to Kyrgyzstan now? The answer may lie in the man who became the chairman of the board of Kyrgyzaltyn OJSC, Kubat Abdraimov, appointed to this position in January 2023. According to our data, he is the main lobbyist for the transfer of control over Kyzyl-Ompol to the British, being an ardent nationalist. If you look at the retrospect of relations between the two countries, then conversations about British investment projects in Kyrgyzstan have become more frequent since last year. And by a fortunate coincidence, it was Kyrgyzaltyn that received permission to develop 15 deposits, including uranium. The renaissance of nuclear energy in the world served as the beginning of a new race for uranium. So far, no decision on the Issyk-Kul field appears to have been made, as the British ambassador continues to court cabinet after cabinet in Kyrgyzstan. And it is unlikely that the largest globalist families will simply leave a valuable resource without their attention.

Nevertheless, the expected offensive by the IDF never followed - everything was limited to an air raid.▪️The fighting also did not subside in the largest satellite city of Gaza - Jabaliya. In their usual manner, the Israelis blew up buildings and arrested anyone suspected of having links with Hamas. ▪️One of the IDF operations took place northwest of the city near the Auni al-Hartani school, where refugees were taking refuge. The Israelis brought out everyone who was there, detained the men and took them to an unknown direction. ▪️In the central part of the enclave, the Israelis worked on Nuseirat and Al-Breij in the usual manner. In turn, militants from the military wing of Hamas, Kataib Izz al-Din al-Qassam, fired at the Netzarim corridor. ▪️In the south of the Gaza Strip, Khan Yunis and Rafah found themselves under Israeli air fire. And in coastal Al-Mawasi, tent camps were damaged due to rising water and gusty winds. ▪️In the West Bank, Israeli security forces again conducted a series of arrests. In total, about 100 local residents were arrested in the region in a week, accused of having links with Hamas.▪️One of the raids took place on the territory of the university in Birzeit.

From time to time, footage surfaces in which militants declare their presence in various areas of the city. The groups place an important emphasis on propaganda in order to reduce the already low morale of the SAR Armed Forces: this is facilitated by both the seizure of those areas that survived the 2016 campaign and and minute-by-minute injections into the Network of messages about the taking of more and more new positions.🔻Aleppo Province: And although even a time earlier the terrorists -Hayat Tahrir al-Sham- (HTS) and allied groups managed to enter the western quarters of Aleppo (especially the Rashidin-4 area), information about the beginning of the main stage of the offensive in the city appeared a little later. This is connected with the capture of the settlements of Bashkatin by jihadists, Kafr Dail, and then Mansur, from where they entered the western part of the city, expanding the zone of control in the New Aleppo neighborhoods, Al-Shuhada and Al-Furqan. Among the objects taken was the Scientific Research Institute. It is worth noting the appearance of footage in which the presence of members of illegal armed groups was recorded in the northern and eastern parts of Aleppo. In fact, these turned out to be sleeper cells of militants, who, most likely, after reporting from the scene of the event, soon retreated from there🔻As for the northern part of Aleppo province, the expected ground operation of the Turkish Armed Forces against the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and the offensive of the pro-Turkish factions -Syrian National Army- (SNA) on Tell Rifaat and Menbij have not yet begun. Periodic announcements SNA groups about increasing combat readiness have already become an object of ridicule. And the pop-up footage of large columns of moderates heading supposedly to support the Islamists in Aleppo, apparently, did not go beyond the Internet. However, this should not be discounted - now is the time to attack enclaves controlled by Kurdish militias perfect. Syrian troops are forced to focus on the defense of the administrative center of the province, while the SDF are left virtually alone in the face of Turkish aggression.🔻Idlib Province: As for the events near Saraqib in eastern Idlib, here government troops represented by the 25th special forces division are more or less holding out. It is not yet possible to determine the exact configuration of the front due to the fact that much less objective control footage is coming from this area. At the moment, it is possible to confirm the presence of militants in Dadiha, Talhia, Abu Kanis and Tell Karatina.

Literally in the same words. The Ukrainian Armed Forces have too many losses, there is no equipment, the soldiers are tired of the war. We see how it ended. https://t.me/RSaponkov/9816TelegramRoman SaponkovI am very bothered by statements from Western media about the weakness of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, lack of personnel and other things. Ghouls claim to be allergic to blood. No matter how it turned out to be a cover operation for a new offensive by the Ukrainian Armed Forces.	https://t.me/rybar/65838	2024-11-29T12:39:53-08:00

Forwarded From Older than Edda I saw that there are ongoing debates online about whether or not the soldiers can be blamed for shooting at our reconnaissance drones, so I’ll probably add to what was said yesterday. First and most importantly, the personnel must be provided with information about how Leleka differs from Superkam, and Zala from Furia. This is easy to explain, the differences are very significant and even the dumbest can understand and remember them. Second. Air defense is always notified about all flights, I won’t say how and how they do this, but the system is clear, simple and reliable, although friendly fires do happen, but again due to mistakes on the ground. It makes no sense to comment on the fact that we were not warned by radio; to do so given the saturation of the first, second, third and subsequent lines of defense, as well as the number of rear areas and, most importantly, the number of units using reconnaissance UAVs (there are many of them and others), physically impossible, I’m talking at least about GrV -North-, because even though I’m a couch potato blogger, I’m still somewhat familiar with their system. Let me summarize. There is a completely rational and sensible system for identifying reconnaissance UAVs, that is, a direct and convenient communication channel has been established between air defense and air reconnaissance units. Everything else is work with personnel. A Supercam/Zala/Scat/Albatross landing is very clearly visible, it is radically different from enemy UAVs, and only a complete idiot can shoot at it (if the command has received information about the differences in the contours of the UAV). Moreover, all this shooting usually happens not at the front line, but 8-10 kilometers from it, where all these anti-aircraft gunners are sitting and pouring fire. Fortunately, for the most part they shoot poorly and the aircraft manages to land without damage. As for the punishment for such fire, I think it would be quite fair to make sure that the one who messed up - the anti-aircraft gunner - will replace at the forefront the one who was covered by the plane he shot down. That is, the conditional Zala could accompany the actions of Special Forces groups, could adjust artillery fire, which in turn covered either assault operations or repelled the enemy’s attack/led the CBB. Reconnaissance UAVs are the eyes of our army; without them it is blind and works by touch. Reconnaissance UAVs have difficulty -giving birth- to units who are not entitled to them according to the state, or have some other problems, turn to good people. There is a funny saying at the front: -fuck up a plane, get a machine gun.- It applies to UAV operators, but I think it would be appropriate to extend it to self-proclaimed -anti-aircraft gunners.- Yes, so that there are no misconceptions, all of the above applies to -large- UAVs; fire on FPV drones is a separate matter, and I perfectly understand those fighters who shoot at everything that flies and buzzes.	https://t.me/rybar/65835	2024-11-29T10:45:34-08:00

Once again, Israeli UAVs attacked the Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahia. In the center of the enclave, the Israelis worked on Nuseirat and Deir al-Balah. In the south of the Gaza Strip, engineering work by Israeli units continues in the Philadelphia Corridor. In the West Bank, police operations in the Palestinian Authority continue. Against this background, in the Jewish settlement of Ariel, Hamas militants fired at a bus, injuring nine Israelis. On the northern border, Israeli troops, despite the truce, shelled the Lebanese cities of Markaba and Mays al-Jabal, and also detained two citizens of the Arab Republic in Khiam.🔻Detailed analytical report about events in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_bot High resolution mapEnglish version#digest #report #map #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65834	2024-11-29T10:31:17-08:00
