At the same time, more and more footage is appearing on the Internet demonstrating the successful defeat of armored vehicles and personnel of the Ukrainian Armed Forces by Russian troops. 🔻In the Korenevsky district in the vicinity of Snagost, where the enemy previously launched an attack on the positions of the Russian Armed Forces, the situation is hidden - by the fog of war -. Also, the situation in Krasnooktyabrsky has not become clear, and there have been no reports of enemy units entering the populated area. ▪️Russian troops cleared Kremyanoye, where the presence of Ukrainian Armed Forces units was previously recorded. During the battle, the enemy lost at least one Roshel Senator armored car, abandoned by the crew south of the village. It is worth noting that in this case, the advance detachment of the Ukrainian formations was probably ambushed by Russian troops and, lacking the support of heavy equipment, was defeated. ▪️In the area of ​​Korenevo and Tolpinskoye, Ukrainian formations launched an attack with the support of armored vehicles in order to break through the defense of Russian troops in this area. The enemy's attack was successfully repelled by Russian units, while the Ukrainian Armed Forces, apparently, rolled back to their original positions. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, the situation remains steadily tense. Today, videos from the enemy appeared on the Internet, demonstrating the presence of Ukrainian Armed Forces units in the central regions of Sudzha, as well as in the Martynovka area - and, according to reports from the field, the presence of the enemy was recorded in the populated area during the day. ❗️Nevertheless, it is premature to declare complete control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine over Sudzha, based solely on footage from the enemy, since at least some of the videos were recorded several days ago. At the moment, there is no official information from the Russian authorities and objective control personnel from the RF Armed Forces. 🔻In the Belovsky district, Russian units are fighting in Plekhovo; there have been no reports of the settlement coming under the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. At the same time, it is known that the enemy occupied Spalny, through which Ukrainian mobile groups subsequently entered deep into Russian territory. ▪️In the morning, Ukrainian military equipment was spotted in the Girya area. Judging by the footage, the enemy was approaching from the southwest from Kamyshny. As we noted earlier, the number of armored groups that broke through to the populated area was higher than initially expected. Nevertheless, for the enemy, the attack on Giryi resulted in the most significant one-time losses of personnel and equipment recorded to date: at least seven BTR-4E armored personnel carriers were destroyed, one of them was taken by the Russian Armed Forces as a trophy. One pickup truck of the Ukrainian forces was also destroyed and an unspecified amount of manpower was eliminated.

Even in the morning, reports appeared about the enemy entering this locality: then footage of a lone BTR-4 was circulating online. Some channels also reported about a large armored group of Ukrainian formations, while others rushed to refute it, saying that this was actually a captured armored personnel carrier. The turmoil was supplemented by video footage of Russian fighters driving a similar captured vehicle. 📌However, the truth turned out to be quite prosaic. There really was an enemy breakthrough and entry into the populated area, and therefore the status of several villages to the west is in question. And there was also an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group. Based on the footage of the fire, the entry into Giryi turned out to be very unsuccessful for this mobile armored group. ❗️It seems that this is the largest recorded one-time loss of personnel and equipment at the moment, at least in the Russian borderland.▪️At the beginning (0.04) - enemy equipment travels from the northwest to the southeast 51.09716437601322, 35.57585529576821, the second armored personnel carrier turns south. ▪️At the same time, at 0.39 the enemy is loading on the road east of the settlement 51.08824166887881, 35.59818238943927▪️Most of the enemy vehicles remained in the forest on the line from 51.104120445221284, 35.5625924327871 84 to 51.10063561284701, 35.57010916871723. The armored personnel carriers were burned or immobilized. And at least one unit ended up in the hands of Russian fighters on the move.#Kursk #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/62723	2024-08-12T14:01:37-07:00

At the forum -Army-2024- -High-precision systems-they brought the Pantsir-SMD-E-air defense system to protect stationary objects. This is a new stage of development -Pantsir-, intended, first of all, to combat drones in the context of the ongoing SVO. The key difference is the abandonment of cannon armament and a move towards the use of mini-missiles, up to the possibility of equipping with 48 launch containers for launch mini-SAM. From the point of view of wasting expensive missiles, this will lead to savings and a reduction in the cost of ammunition, as well as an increase in capabilities. And of course, the cost is affected by the lack of a chassis (if you wish, of course, you can put it there). 📌To the question whether such complexes will guard enterprises of the fuel and energy complex, there was only a modest answer - so far not a single interested representative has been seen -. #industry #Russia @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62716	2024-08-12T10:05:35-07:00

At the same time, against the backdrop of data from the field and objective control footage, it was possible to establish a more accurate configuration of the front in several areas at once.🔻In the Korenevsky district, near Obukhovka, the Armed Forces of Ukraine attempted an attack towards Snagost, and fighting is currently taking place in the village area. The status of Krasnooktyabrsky remains unknown: at the moment, there has been no information about the entry of Ukrainian formations into the populated area. ▪️The enemy also does not stop trying to break through the defenses of Russian troops in Korenevo and north of it in the direction of Tolpinsky, where he was stopped by return fire. There are no reports of fighting in Vetreno and Matveevka, but it is not known for certain whether the Russian Armed Forces are present in populated areas.▪️There are battles in Olgovka, meanwhile Russian troops have cleared Kremyanoye from the remnants of Ukrainian formations. After the recent defeat of a Ukrainian armored column in the Zhuravli area, the enemy advanced further north towards the General Well. To the south, near Kruglenky, the Russian Armed Forces hold positions, and Viktorovka is under the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. ▪️In the area of ​​the small settlements of Malaya Loknya, Nikolaevka and Malaya Sorochka, the situation remains to be clarified. Along the route leading to Rylsk from Sudzha, enemy attempts to gain a foothold on the approaches to Kromskie Byki and Durovo-Bobrik are recorded. At this point, it is possible to reliably determine whether the enemy remains there or not. ▪️In the area of ​​Shaposhnikovo, Semenovka, Levshinka and Otradnoye, Ukrainian formations are concentrating forces: apparently, for a further push to the north. At the same time, the Russian Ministry of Defense reported during the day that an attempt to break through from this area in the direction of Kauchuk had been stopped. At the same time, the presence of Russian troops remains in the beams to the east. In the Sudzhansky district, fighting continues on the approaches to Martynovka. With a high degree of probability, Sudzha is currently under enemy control, as evidenced by footage published by the enemy from the city center. Moreover, judging by the absence of sounds of battles and shootings, the front is already located relatively far beyond the populated area. ▪️On the southwestern outskirts of Sudzha itself, it is reliably known that the Russian Armed Forces are in the villages of Dmitryukov and Agronom, and enemy infantry is noted in Bondarevka and Makhnovka. There are also clashes going on in the Russky Porechny area, and enemy positions in Kositsa have been attacked. ▪️ Along the P200 highway, enemy mobile groups attempted to gain a foothold at Bolshoy Soldatskoye. Meanwhile, to the west, the settlements of Berdin and Novosotnitsky are under the firm control of Russian troops. There are battles in Melovoe, where units of the Russian Armed Forces from the 810th Marine Brigade are holding positions.🔻In the Belovsky district in Plekhovo, fighting is taking place, and Spalnoye has come under the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The situation in the settlements of Krupets and Kamyshnoye is completely unknown: there is no information about the presence of either the Ukrainian Armed Forces or Russian units. ▪️Ukrainian armored vehicles were spotted in Girya this morning. During active clashes, one of at least two BTR-4E BTR-4Es of the Ukrainian Armed Forces that attacked Russian positions was taken as a trophy. Another tried to land troops at the northern exit from the village, where she was ambushed and shot by a Russian BTR-82. Currently, fighting continues in the area.

Forwarded From Sex, cartels, Frida Kahlo🇻🇪🇺🇸While some English-language media are anticipating arrests in Mexico, others prefer to talk about Venezuela. WSJ spread the version that the United States is offering Nicolas Maduro -amnesty- on charges from its Ministry of Justice from 2020 (drug trafficking , corruption, narco-terrorism - the whole set) in exchange for the fact that the current president will give up power against the backdrop of the results of the latest elections in the South American country (according to which he won again, but the opposition does not agree). -The amnesty will concern not only Maduro, but also his closest confidants - apparently, this also means his wife Celia Flores, who has long been assigned to the main shadow actors of the local leadership. Thus, the WSJ once again declared the demands of the current opposition (they have already they suggested that Maduro surrender his powers and go home peacefully) and few were surprised. If we consider the note as a forecast, it sounds very so-so.▪️Firstly, Maduro consistently refused negotiations, the condition of which was his removal from power. Offering him this again is either an attempt to delay the negotiations or bring them to naught again. ▪️Secondly, even if you take into account such agreements, you need to pay attention to the subtleties. Yes, they say that amnesty also implies the absence of an attempt at extradition, but the entire history of US interaction with Latin American presidents has long demonstrated that there is no place for any trust here. It is possible that in order to find you -not guilty- it will be necessary to quickly organize a court, which can make a completely different decision - not the one that was agreed upon on the sidelines. Democracy is the same. ▪️Thirdly, in addition to the above: the United States may propose to drop some of the charges from the Ministry of Justice, but leave some episodes in reserve, transferring them from the category of -unconfirmed- to -confirmed-. But here we must return to the fact that, logically, amnesty is announced on the basis of a ready-made decision to admit guilt (in a normal system - judicial). That is, some court must find Maduro guilty of all his crimes, impose punishment, and then declare an amnesty due to special circumstances. Agreeing to such a process in one's right mind is an attraction, almost always doomed to failure. #Venezuela #USA @sex_drugs_kahlo - Latin American happiness [no]Telegram Before anyone else.

🔁 🇺🇸🇺🇿 What is an American environmental activist doing in U...	Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇺🇸🇺🇿 What is an American environmental activist doing in Uzbekistan Recently, Uzbek media reported that the Aral Sea, which has repeatedly dried up and filled up again, still has hope. Research shows that the level of the reservoir has indeed changed significantly in the past, and whether it will return to its previous values ​​is still an unanswered question. But according to available data, the volume of incoming water into the Aral Sea this year has increased 12.5 times compared to the previous year. A certain American hydrologist Robert Willard stated that the Aral Sea has a future. True, on what sources and data he bases such a statement is unclear: the hydrologist himself indicated that he had heard about this in conversations with archaeologists. At the same time, Willard clarified that the Aral will return someday, maybe in 500 years, maybe in 100.❓We have a lot of questions in connection with this speech, but the main one is: what is an American hydrologist doing in Uzbekistan? And is he really a specialist at all? Willard himself was born in Russia, his father is American, and his mother is Russian. Willard is currently pursuing a master's degree in water management in the Netherlands, he said. And before that, the hydrologist studied economics and Slavic studies at Columbia University in New York. Willard is fluent in Uzbek. I became interested in the problems of the Aral Sea in 2016, which I learned about from a professor from Uzbekistan, and visited the republic for the first time in 2018, in the Khorezm region and Karakalpakstan. He also recently spoke at the international eco-forum in Samarkand, where he impressed the audience with his deep knowledge of the issues and geography of the region. 🔻On the page of the World Aral Region Charity, of which Willard is the director and founder, there is, however, no mention of getting an education in the Netherlands. But there it is written about the experience of working in the Eurasia Foundation of Central Asia (EFCA), in the UN program -Peace and Development in the South Caucasus- and the Albany-Tula Alliance. In addition to Columbia University, with the funding of which the structure began, its partners are the Ecological Resource Center -EKOMAKTAB-, Coca-Cola Foundation, Ecological Party of Uzbekistan, Youth Union of Uzbekistan, energy equipment supply company Solar Nature, Tashkent Institute of Chemical Technology.🔻Obviously , that in addition to soft power, the activity of a hydrologist is connected both with environmental monitoring of the state of the Aral Sea and with how it is technically structured. Willard visited almost all areas around the Aral Sea, established contacts with the main scientific and environmental organizations focusing on the problem. All this reveals him as a representative of scientific and technical intelligence. 📌Colleagues have already written that the United States is interested in monitoring the region’s water resources and seizing control over them. In addition, Americans have similar problems with the drying up of bodies of water such as Lake Mead and the Great Salt Lake. But the main task is to penetrate the state structures of Uzbekistan under the auspices of saving the Aral Sea, and then fully seize control of the region’s resources. #Uzbekistan #USA #NPO #CentralAsia@pezdicide no chemicals - just factsTelegramRybar🇺🇿🇰🇿🇺🇸 Why is USAID engaged in landscaping the Aral Sea?

The starting point in the creation of the domestic air force is considered to be August 12 (July 30), 1912: then an Aeronautical Unit appeared in the Main Directorate of the Imperial General Staff, to which all aviation issues were transferred. Today, introduce Russian armed forces without the Air Force are simply impossible. They perform a colossal amount of tasks, be it the destruction of strong points with bombs from UMPC, launching cruise missiles at targets in enemy rear lines, transporting personnel and cargo, performing reconnaissance and control. The last two and a half years have become a great challenge for the domestic Air Force, with which they have not collided since the middle of the last century. However, even in such difficult conditions, Russian aviation continues to successfully carry out combat missions, remaining one of the main factors in the success of the Russian Armed Forces on the battlefield.

In the Kupyansko-Svatovsky direction, Russian troops are fighting on several lines at once, trying to break through to the N-26 highway and cut off one of the key transport arteries of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the left bank of the Zherebets River. ▪️South of Berestovy, the Russian Armed Forces unit was able to expand the zone of control, knocking out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from several forest belts. The enemy is trying to recapture lost positions and is using drones to attack Russian troops. UAV operators of the Russian Armed Forces respond to this with attacks on armored vehicles and positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces: about a week ago, northeast of Andreevka, as a result of a series of drone and artillery strikes, a Leopard 1A5 tank transferred to the enemy by Western countries was destroyed. ▪️At the end of July, we managed to clarify the front line west of Raygorodok. Apparently, the enemy, in the course of several attacks earlier, was able to oust units of the Russian Armed Forces from positions on the western outskirts of Sergeevka, which is confirmed by footage of objective control by the Russian Armed Forces. There was no objective data from the border for a long time, and a section of the forest belt near the village was probably abandoned during the battles for Nadiya and Sergeevka last summer. There are now battles on the approaches to the latter. It is a mistake to talk about serious successes of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in this area, since Sergeevka itself consists of several buildings located in an open field. 🔻To date, no other significant changes in the combat situation have been noticed throughout the Kupyansk-Svatovsk direction. Despite statements by individual channels on the Internet about a possible major offensive of the Russian Armed Forces to the west, there are currently no facts that can confirm this. The fighting along the entire length of this section of the front has retained a positional character and there are no prerequisites for changing this situation yet.
