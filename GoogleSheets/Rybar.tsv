🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦 Strengthening the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Pokr...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 Strengthening the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Pokrovsky direction: how an operational crisis neutralizes the advantages of the defensive lines of the Armed Forces of Ukraine - Rybar Analysis The rapid offensive of Russian troops in the Pokrovsky direction often meets fierce resistance from the enemy, who has equipped hundreds of kilometers of fortifications in the occupied part of the DPR. Most of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ fortifications are platoon and company strongholds with a developed firing and camouflage system, which turns each assault on such a fortification into a separate operation. Sometimes Russian units encounter fortifications that are truly monstrous in size, playing the role of key defense centers of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. ▪️A striking example of this is a large stronghold east of Zhelanny First, taken by the Russian Armed Forces during the fighting in this area in July. This defensive unit began to be built by the enemy, presumably shortly before the retreat of the Ukrainian Armed Forces from Avdeevka, and was supposed to become an impassable obstacle for Russian units due to its location and size. A large system of trenches and equipped firing points, located in an open field and covered by UAVs and artillery is indeed capable of stopping the advance of even large military formations for a long time in conditions of air superiority of various types of drones. Even smaller fortifications, with proper defense and well-established communication among units, are capable of holding back advances on entire sections of the front for years - Nevelskoye, located to the south, the battle for which lasted more than a year, is proof of this. 🔻Nevertheless, a large stronghold east of Novoselovka First was successfully taken by Russian troops in less than a week of fighting. In conditions of an operational crisis and the inability of the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to competently build interaction between units, this defense center has turned into a huge target for Russian aviation and drones. An additional factor was the fact that the assault units of the Russian Armed Forces attacked the enemy’s stronghold from the northeast, negating many of the advantages of the fortification, erected to hold back the advances of Russian troops from the east. Coordinates: 48.215605, 37.475699▪️Russian units met another large stronghold of the Ukrainian Armed Forces southwest of Timofeevka. Enemy fortifications were erected in the area of ​​the C-05-09-07 highway and covered the crossing over Kazenny Torets, located in a populated area. The enemy's defensive unit was a system of trenches and firing points and, apparently, was adapted for all-round defense. In conditions of a stable front, such a line could stall the advance of Russian troops to Timofeevka and Lisichny and would require significant forces to take it. However, without established communication between units and UAV cover, the strong point was under threat of encirclement and was taken by the Russian Armed Forces within a few days. Coordinates: 48.276491, 37.479241🔻During the special operation, we have repeatedly witnessed how even smaller defensive lines held back the advance of advancing troops on one or another section of the front for a long time. Enemy fortifications in the Kupyansk-Svatovsky, Limansky and Seversky directions have been causing significant problems for the Russian Armed Forces for more than a year due to the geographical features of the area and the positional nature of the combat operations. However, many of the advantages of this kind of fortification are lost in conditions of an operational crisis, similar to what is happening with the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Pokrovsky direction. Even the most powerful enemy defensive positions, in the absence of a sufficient number of infantry and support means to hold them, turn into an easy target for Russian attack aircraft. A separate problem for Ukrainian formations is the low moral and psychological state of the units, which are regularly exposed to attacks from Russian air forces and artillery and are forced to hold unfavorable positions.

Ukrainian formations have not yet attempted to advance and are limiting themselves to attacks on populated areas south of the Seim River and crossings. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, Ukrainian troops, apparently, were able to advance a little more last day than was initially known. Some time after the footage of the strikes in Vishneve appeared, videos of UAV strikes on a Ukrainian tank on the outskirts of Komarovka were published on the Internet. At the same time, due to the terrain, Ukrainian armored vehicles could appear in a populated area, driving through Vishnevka or the 10th October tract from Apanasivka. At the same time, messages about the presence of the enemy appeared only in the context of Vishnevka - later messages about the complete control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces over the village were published on the Internet. There is relative calm in the Sudzhansky district. Russian troops are striking at identified enemy positions, and the Ukrainian Armed Forces are conducting engineering work in populated areas under their control. 🔻In the Bolshesoldatsky district, according to Russian journalists, the settlement of Nechaevo and the surrounding area were liberated. At the same time, according to our data, the Ukrainian formations did not even enter the village itself, but were stopped in the Obruchye forest area, where they were subjected to several air strikes. Now, apparently, the forest has been cleared. 🔻Meanwhile, the installation of reinforced concrete shelters began in Kursk. Zheleznogorsk and Kurchatov will also be equipped with standard modular buildings.

This time, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense, 28 drones were intercepted in six regions. ▪️The main blow fell on the Volgograd region, where enemy UAVs tried to attack the Marinovka military airfield, where Su-24MR operational-tactical aircraft are also stationed. At the same time, hangars were previously installed at the facility itself, which made it possible to reduce the damage. A significant amount of on-site footage has appeared on the Internet, showing a hit on the airfield and a fire that broke out there. The attack also affected the Volgograd airport, where the reception and departure of aircraft were temporarily suspended. ▪️In the Rostov region, Russian anti-aircraft gunners intercepted Ukrainian drones in the area of ​​Novoshakhtinsk and Krasny Sulin. Apparently, the main target of the Ukrainian Armed Forces was the Morozovsk airfield, which at the beginning of the month came under fire from the Ukrainian Armed Forces. At the same time, in the region, the elimination of a fire on the territory of the Rosrezerv oil depot in the Proletarsky district, which arose as a result of an attack by an enemy UAV, has been ongoing for the fourth day. To date, firefighters have extinguished the fire in six tanks, but the total number of injured employees of the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations has grown to 47 people. ▪️In the Belgorod region, Ukrainian drones attacked the villages of Yasnye Zori and Veselaya Lopan: residential buildings were damaged, but there were no casualties. ▪️Several more drones were intercepted in the Voronezh, Bryansk and Kursk regions - according to the latest information, no damage was recorded there. 🔻In recent weeks, Ukrainian formations have literally carried out one massive raid after another, which clearly demonstrates the high volume of drone production from the enemy - yesterday the Armed Forces of Ukraine launched 45 drones, and already tonight about 30 more devices. At the same time, Ukrainian formations choose both military airfields and fuel and energy infrastructure facilities as their main targets. And, although most UAVs can be intercepted, a few drones often manage to reach their targets. And as we have repeatedly noted, in order to minimize damage and repel such raids, it is necessary to both build hangars and solve the difficulties with organization, interaction and control for intercepting UAVs moving along the same corridors.

At the same time, the footage was published by the enemy, and therefore the outcome of the battle is not obvious and a slightly greater advance is very likely. Between the railway and the Solenenkaya gully, a small success of Russian troops east of the O0532 highway is also recorded. Several forest belts came under the control of the RF Armed Forces.🔻In addition, earlier, by August 18, Russian troops reached the Mylny pond in the Ikryannaya gully south of the dachas of the 3rd mine. At the same time, according to some reports, fighting in the dachas has already begun, but so far this has not been confirmed by objective monitoring personnel. 🔻In the vicinity of Ugledar, the situation remains relatively stable. No attempts at advancement are recorded, and in Pavlovka and Yegorovka, Ukrainian formations carry out UAV strikes on identified places of presence of the Russian Armed Forces.

He declared full support for Moldova on its path to the EU and against destabilization from Russia. ▪️At the meeting they recalled how much Germany is investing in Moldova in connection with the Ukrainian crisis. ▪️For example, Germany, together with France and Romania, has been participating in the Moldova Support Platform since 2022, through which Western countries pour hundreds of millions of dollars into the military and other needs of the country, thereby ensuring a stable anti-Russian course of the country’s leadership. Moreover, Moldova is the main transit hub for the supply of Western weapons for the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the export of Ukrainian grain. ▪️In addition, Germany is also actively involved in the militarization of Moldova, supplying military equipment under the slogan of -countering the Russian threat.- 🔻We can agree that Scholz’s current visit to Moldova is purely symbolic and expresses support for Sandu’s candidacy for re-election to a second term. Such a visit, for example, has already been made by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Germany also personifies the EU.

The enemy strikes, but makes attempts to cross the state border, Russian troops are building pontoon crossings under fire from Ukrainian formations, and enemy aircraft continue to strike Tetkino.🔻Fighting continues in the neighboring Korenevsky district. Russian troops hold Korenevo firmly, but to the south the enemy, having passed Snagost, entered the neighboring village of Vishnevka in a column, where he was covered by UAV and artillery strikes. At the same time, based on the terrain and bridges, the Ukrainian formations could not enter Vishnevka without controlling Snagost, which confirms the absence of the Russian Armed Forces in the village. ▪️The status of Apanasovka, Vezapny and Byakhovo remains in question. The enemy at least entered the first two, but Byakhovo did not appear in the reports either under anyone’s control or in the context of shelling. Viktorovka and Uspenovka, cut off by the Blyakhovets River, most likely remain in the gray zone if they are not controlled by the enemy. 🔻There are also battles in the Sudzhansky district. Enemy forces in Borki and Spalny are subject to multiple attacks, but apparently, the settlements have not yet been liberated from Ukrainian forces. At the same time, Russian troops do not stop launching artillery and air strikes on the border territory of the Sumy region, where the enemy still operates large concentrations of personnel and equipment.

Thus, the Malian army, with the support of the PMC - Wagner - carried out raids in some villages, where militant informants and weapons were found. After reconnaissance, the convoys returned with prisoners.▪️The center of the country is also uneasy - in the Mopti region. The bombings of government vehicles continued along the -road of death- from Duentza to Gossi. Also in the vicinity, Islamists attacked an army convoy that was traveling to Diallasaga. 15 soldiers were killed in the ambush.▪️Reconnaissance is being carried out along the Mauritanian border in order to identify militant cells and eliminate them. But the territory of Mauritania was again used by militants from the al-Qaeda-affiliated group JNIM as a rear base for raids on Malian territory. Along the border they attacked two army posts, from where the soldiers fled, leaving behind their weapons.🔻All this once again highlights the problems of the Malian armed forces. Of course, the government is increasing the number of personnel, but due to the lack of officers, the effectiveness of the reinforcements is extremely low. This problem directly affects our interests in the country. Thus, during a telephone conversation between the heads of the Russian and Mali Foreign Ministries, Lavrov said that Russian structures are ready to help increase the combat capability of the army. Most likely, these words mean the deployment of the Afrika Korps, which has been expected in the country for more than a month.

It turned out that the German defense concern Rheinmetall broke the contract for the supply of 155 mm artillery shells to Poland. The contract was concluded back in 2022 for 50 thousand shells. As of today, Warsaw has not received any of them. However, the Germans claim that the deliveries were disrupted of their own free will. The ammunition for the Poles was supposed to be produced by a subsidiary of a German company - the South African company Rheinmetall Denel Munition, but the deal was eventually blocked by the South African government, fearing that they could end up in Ukraine. It is not yet clear whether the South African authorities could really arrange a kind of sabotage for the Poles , at least as a kind of revenge for Warsaw’s prank last year. However, there is a suspicion that not all German partners are simply happy with the fact that the defense concern Rheinmetall earns a lot of money. This belief is partially confirmed by the fact that after alleged statements by the German authorities about reducing assistance to the Kyiv regime, the company's shares fell by a sensitive 4.5%.

Also, many terrorist accomplices were detained in the villages. During these operations, about 80 militants were eliminated. However, during the usual escort of a civilian convoy transporting ore from the mine by a rapid reaction detachment, an ambush occurred. During it, more than 100 military personnel and miners were killed, and all the weapons went to the Islamists.▪️Reconnaissance with UAVs was also carried out in the areas bordering Mali, which revealed large concentrations of militants. The air strike managed to hit several militant vehicles with personnel.▪️But the militants continue to expand their influence to the south - attacks continue in Benin and Togo. Even if these are small clashes, this could soon develop into a full-fledged invasion. In addition, cooperation with Russian companies regarding the construction of nuclear power plants in the country is intensifying. The Minister of Energy of Burkina Faso met with the Rosatom delegation in Ouagadougou. According to the Russian side, there are only two stages left before the launch of the project, and after that a construction site will be selected. This initiative is very important, as it is an illustrative example of the work of Russian companies in Africa. Many specialists are afraid or do not want to go to the Black Continent, but if there are more and more successful cases, the flow of those wishing to do so will increase.

Forwarded From Two Majors⚡️NATO strengthens Romanian air defense on the routes of Russian attack drones The Deployable Air Command and Control Center (DACCC) redeployed the LANZA LTR-25 mobile radar with a crew from 🇮🇹Italy to the Romanian border town of Cataloi (Tulcea County), located 25 km from the city of Izmail. The radar is capable of detecting targets at a range of up to 450 km. The decision is justified by the need to strengthen the defense of the airspace of NATO's eastern flank against the backdrop of the systematic discovery of debris from attack drones in Romania. On August 20, fragments of a drone were discovered in Tulcea County. Also, fragments of a UAV were discovered on March 28, 2024, on a plot of agricultural land in the area of ​​Bolshoy Island (near the city of Brail). Previously, Romania redeployed to the Ukrainian direction (to the Danube Delta area, Tulcea County) means of countering drones attacking Ukrainian Danube ports. In addition, since February 2022, the SAMP-T air defense system has been deployed on the Black Sea coast of Romania at the Capu Midia military base as part of the Eagle mission of the French Armed Forces. The installations of the Patriot air defense system of the Romanian Air Force are based in the same area.✨Against the background of information about the possible use of Romanian airfields for basing the F-16 Air Force of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the strengthening of air defense may be due to the need to cover them. In addition, there is a high probability of indirect participation of NATO countries in repelling Russian air attacks on the Danube infrastructure of Ukraine.

After the prisoners began to be taken back, the convoy was ambushed by terrorists, during which about 30 people were killed. At the same time, thanks to aerial reconnaissance near the city of Bankilare, a large concentration of militants was destroyed with the help of a UAV. As a result, about a dozen extremists were neutralized.▪️To the south, on the border with Burkina Faso, where militants associated with Al-Qaeda JNIM settled, terrorist detachments were also eliminated, from where they sometimes arrive. More than 20 radicals were eliminated in local forests. After the summit of the Alliance of Sahel States, at which the decision was made to create a confederation, there is solidarity between the foreign policy departments of Ouagadougou, Bamako and Niamey. After Kiev supported the attack on Tin-Zautin by Islamists, all three countries broke off relations with it, calling on the UN to condemn the actions of the Ukrainian leadership. In addition, ties with the Algerian authorities strengthened. There is an active discussion between the ministers on issues of security and economic integration.🔻Once again we emphasize that the pragmatic authorities of Niamey maneuver between the interests of many countries, but remain committed to the course of sovereignty with Russian support. And the support of the Afrika Korps allows for large-scale counter-terrorism operations, which has a positive effect on the situation inside the country.

Similarly with the Bryansk region, the UAVs moved wave after wave and were shot down as they approached the coverage area of ​​the local air defense system. No destruction or casualties were identified in the region. ▪️In the Kaluga region, not far from the border with the Bryansk region, 3 drones were intercepted; in the Kursk region, air defense forces shot down two UAVs, as well as two missiles. Another six drones were intercepted in the Belgorod region. ▪️In the area of ​​Novoshakhtinsk in the Rostov region, air defense units, according to some information, shot down an OTRK ATACMS missile of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The ammunition fell in a vacant lot and caused a fire in dry grass; nearby buildings suffered window damage due to the blast wave. There were no casualties. ❗️To date, this is the first recorded case of an enemy using the ATACMS OTRK at targets in the internationally recognized territories of Russia. This was probably just a test launch and the enemy will soon launch combined attacks using this type of missile.

🖼 🇺🇸 About the course of the election race in the USA Since th...	🇺🇸 About the course of the election race in the USA Since the publication of our last review on this topic, little has changed in the alignment of political forces on the eve of the elections, however, some interesting nuances have become known. 🔻Polls are still not on Donald Trump's side.▪️A New York Times/Siena College study from August 9 showed Trump trailing Kamala Harris by four percentage points (pp.) in the key US swing states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania . For the Republican team, this is an alarming call, since the victory of one or another candidate will depend precisely on the outcome of the fight in the above-mentioned regions. ▪️An Emerson College poll dated August 14 showed that in terms of voter support, Harris is ahead of Trump by 4 percentage points. — 50% preferred the Democrat, 46% preferred her opponent.▪️A study on the same topic by CBS together with the authoritative YouGov on August 16 showed that Trump is inferior to Harris by 3 percentage points. - 48% versus 51%. Trump himself, at the same time, stopped remaining silent on this topic and switched to a strategy of denial and discrediting American analytical agencies - the politician claims that the results were bought by the Democrats in order to boost Kamala’s image. As an argument, from time to time he conducts surveys on the social network X, in which he demonstrates unconditional leadership. As for the Democrats, they, fearing to frighten away success, switched to the tactics of total caution - Kamala Harris literally turned into an outlandish animal in a cage, which is carried around country and are shown for the amusement of the public. Harris is prohibited from giving any unplanned&nbsp; interviews or hold press conferences where she could be put in an uncomfortable position - Donald Trump has repeatedly said this and even publications loyal to Democrats have noticed this. Another confirmation of the above was Kamala’s refusal to debate with her rival on Fox News on September 4. Her patrons, especially the Obama family, are more often in favor of Harris. In general, the kicking of Joe Biden from the presidential campaign demonstrated the strength of the Obama, Clinton and Pelosi clans - including their ability to influence the decisions made by the president and his aides. And if Biden still had some say, Kamala Harris turned into a real talking head with no opinion of her own. As for further developments, Kamala’s debate with Trump could change the current situation. However, Democrats are so afraid of frightening off their happiness that they may even abandon them altogether. The move is unpopular, but the temptation is too great. They will always be able to sell this to the voter - they will simply say that there is nothing to talk about with -criminal-Harris. #USA@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62950	2024-08-21T05:11:53-07:00
