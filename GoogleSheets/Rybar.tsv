Assault groups operate on the northwestern outskirts of the village. Moreover, taking into account the source of personnel, in reality the settlement may already be completely liberated. To the east of the village, at least part of the forest belts on both sides of the Seversky Donets - Donbass canal was also cleared.▪️There are battles in Kirovo (Pivnichny), and most of the settlement has also come under the control of Russian troops. The enemy presence remains in the northwestern outskirts north of the cemetery. However, given the ongoing clashes, it is most likely that Ukrainian forces will try to engage and hold Dachne to the west for as long as possible. ▪️On the eastern outskirts of Dzerzhinsk (Toretsk), advanced groups of attack aircraft some time ago were able to occupy the intersection of Tereshkova Street and the 91st Division. There are battles for the territory of the Central Hospital and garages to the south. Toretsk correctional colony No. 2 could become one of the enemy’s complex defense centers, but only if the operational crisis does not worsen. The situation in the neighborhoods on the southern outskirts, in the area of ​​Gaidar Street, remains hidden in the fog of war. Russian troops launched an attack through the territory of a mental hospital that had been occupied earlier, but how successful it is remains unclear. ▪️The situation is similar in the Nelepovka area and north of Novgorod (New York). There has been no information about new attacks by the Russian Armed Forces or counterattacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, but this does not directly indicate a lull.

There was also a shootout on the southern outskirts of the Az-Zeitoun district. The first case of polio was recorded in the central part of the enclave. Previously, over a million vaccines were delivered to the region, which were distributed to medical institutions that continued to operate. In the south of the Gaza Strip, IDF units occupied the Dar al-Salam hospital on the outskirts of Khan Yunis and advanced further along the Salah al-Din highway, where they almost reached the central part of Bani Suheila . In the West Bank, Israeli security forces carried out one of the largest raids in recent weeks, as a result of which more than 40 local residents were detained and several militant commanders were killed. The tense situation remains along the Lebanese-Israeli border: the parties continue to exchange blows and report the destruction of targets, but so far the situation remains relatively stable. 🔻A detailed analytical report on events in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_botHigh resolution mapEnglish version#digest #map #Israel #Palestine #report@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63149	2024-08-29T11:34:17-07:00

Forwarded From Awakening Dragon 🐲🇺🇸🇨🇳 US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, at a press conference following his trip to China, said that Washington and Beijing have not made progress in discussing a solution to the Ukrainian conflict. In general, it would be a mistake to believe that this or that part of the Ukrainian issue will be resolved at such meetings. Just look at the White House press release following the meeting between Sullivan and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The issue of the Ukrainian crisis is clearly not in the first place - the same is evident in the document, which is dedicated to the meeting of an American official with the Chinese Foreign Minister. If some people expected progress on this issue as a result of meetings aimed primarily at stabilizing Sino-American relations, then perhaps this week's negotiations were initially perceived incorrectly. @awaken_dragonTelegram The video shows ⚡️ China and the United States have made no progress in discussing a solution to the Ukrainian crisis, have not outlined any plan - Biden assistant Sullivan ▶️ Subscribe to WATCH	https://t.me/rybar/63148	2024-08-29T10:32:21-07:00

Forwarded From Informant The Air Command of the Ukrainian Armed Forces also got in touch and posted an official obituary for F-16 pilot Alexey Mes. According to the text, the fighter he controlled was hunting Russian cruise missiles and kamikaze drones during a massive missile strike on August 26, allegedly shooting down three cruise missiles and one UAV, but killing himself. This formulation hints that the F-16 was either shot down by its own air defense fire, which also fired at missiles and drones, or its fighter crashed into one of the air targets, by the way, there was already such a precedent in the Air Force - in December 2022, the MiG-29, while hunting for -Geranium-, he lost and crashed into the wreckage of a drone. Although the assumption of a missile strike on the F-16 is still not ruled out, the official version broadcast by Ukrainian officials is ridiculous in its absurdity: the long-awaited Western fighter under the control of a pilot, which took a year and a half to develop, simply fell apart on a rocket or -Geranium- after just three weeks of its presence in Ukraine, you don’t even need to imagine the faces of your Western partners.

The enemy introduces parts of the TrO into the territory of the Russian Federation as reinforcement units, and in the adjacent territory of the Sumy region the movements of large concentrations of personnel are recorded. In addition, it is planned to transfer 92 brigades in full force to Sudzha and the surrounding area.🔻In the Glushkovsky district, the situation remains extremely tense. Information has appeared on the Internet about cutting off Tetkino by destroying bridges, but so far there is no clear evidence of this. At the same time, we reported both about the enemy’s possibility of this move and about its high probability two weeks ago. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, the enemy does not stop trying to advance in the Korenevo area, while simultaneously transferring forces to the vicinity of Olgovka and to the settlement itself, where he is advancing within the borders of the village and in the direction of Durovka. ▪️From time to time, information appears about the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ attempts to advance in the direction of Sheptukhovka, but so far without specifics. Scattered enemy groups were previously recorded both to the west and east of the village, while the capture or liberation of adjacent villages was not clearly reported. ▪️To the south there are battles in the vicinity of Komarovka. The enemy tried to attack, but was stopped, after which he rolled back to Vishnevka. The latter remains under the control of Ukrainian formations; there have been no reports of counterattacks by the Russian Armed Forces in the area. 🔻There are also battles in the Sudzhansky district, the enemy is not reducing activity. In the area of ​​Leonidovka, Pokrovsky and Lyubimovka, Ukrainian formations are accumulating assault groups with the aim of further advancement. ▪️Fighting also continues in Borki, where the Ukrainian Armed Forces are trying to advance with the forces of units of the 92nd Special Brigade and two TrO battalions. The enemy fears an attack from Pushkarny, where he was actively conducting reconnaissance.

This time we decided to clearly examine what the new plan of the Ukrainian command might be: unlike last year’s offensive attempt, the enemy is preparing for a possible attack in the west of the region - there, after occupying Vasilyevka, the Ukrainian Armed Forces will have the opportunity to advance both towards the Zaporizhia NPP and Tokmak. As we have already noted, such plans of the Ukrainian command are indicated by the increasing frequency of satellite imagery of Russian Armed Forces facilities and the simultaneous concentration of forces towards Primorsky. There, according to various estimates, up to four brigades could have accumulated at the moment - it is they who can be used as a strike force. And although it is not entirely clear when and where the enemy will decide to bring his plan into reality, it is important to understand that he did not abandon the offensive on this section of the front, even despite the worsening operational crisis of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Pokrovsky, Aleksandro-Kalinovsky, and Yuzhnodonetsk directions. #video #Zaporozhye #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63145	2024-08-29T08:06:46-07:00

Forwarded From Two Majors On the eve of the presidential elections and the European referendum in 🇲🇩Moldova, the influence of ⚡️NATO countries is increasing. After the visit of the saboteur German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to Chisinau on August 21, the first outlines of future cooperation began to appear. What they expected was not investing in the restoration of decrepit infrastructure, but increasing the country’s military potential. The German Minister of Defense announced a contract for the European branch of General Dynamics (GD) to overhaul 14 Piranha armored personnel carriers, which will be delivered to the Moldovan Armed Forces as part of military-technical assistance. In addition, the company’s specialists will train Moldovan military personnel in the operation of this equipment. Previously, we reported on deliveries&nbsp; Germany&nbsp; up to 20 Piranha armored personnel carriers, medical equipment and patrol boats. At the same time, military maneuvers with NATO countries continued, designed to increase interoperability with the countries of the Alliance. From August 5 to 23, multinational exercises - Fire Shield 2024 - took place in Moldova with the participation of the US Armed Forces and Romanian Armed Forces. NATO's presence in all areas of defense is expanding. August 1, 2024 Deputy The head of the Border Police of Moldova A. Trofimov met with the British Assistant Minister for Combating Organized Crime and Illicit Finance K. Holden. It is planned to establish a direct exchange of information on combating illegal migration, drug trafficking and other cross-border crimes. In addition, on August 6, Moldovan border guards received five FurSeal 485 boats from Germany (in order to better catch Uhilants from Ukraine). Romania continued the physical absorption of Moldova. Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure of Romania through the company Administrația Porturilor Maritime S.A. Constanța plans to buy shares in the port of Giurgiulesti. As comrade @rybar reports, on August 28, 2024, a decision was made to create a commission to resolve this issue. Against this background, published statistics indicate the increasing decline of Moldova. According to the latest data, 41.9% of Moldovan citizens aged 14-34 years are outside the country. It is significant that against the backdrop of the devastation of the 90s,&nbsp; depreciation of infrastructure accumulated&nbsp; debts, corruption and population outflow, EU and NATO countries&nbsp; concentrate their efforts specifically on the military sphere.&nbsp; ✨After slave Ukraine destroys its combat-ready population, pays off all its property for debts and can no longer carry out the commands of its Western masters, it will be replaced by Moldova.

🎬 🇮🇱🇵🇸 Almost every day anti-government protests take place ...	🇮🇱🇵🇸 Almost daily, anti-government protests take place in Israel demanding the release of hostages from the Gaza Strip and a truce with Hamas. Moreover, today the relatives of the hostages held a demonstration not in the usual Tel Aviv or Jerusalem, but in close proximity to the border with the Palestinian enclave. Armed with posters and loudspeakers, they shouted the names of their loved ones and even managed to break through one of the barriers on the way to the Gaza Strip. Nevertheless, the Israeli security forces managed to restrain the dissatisfied and persuade them to go to the nearby border kibbutz Nirim - according to media reports, there were no casualties. Be that as it may, this is not the first demonstration of relatives of hostages near the Gaza Strip. Previously, they had repeatedly rallied at checkpoints, preventing convoys carrying humanitarian aid for Palestinians from entering the enclave. Apparently, this time a new strategy of action was chosen, which, however, was assessed quite positively in some Israeli media. #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63140	2024-08-29T06:14:55-07:00
☢️🇰🇿 How Western NGOs in Kazakhstan are looking for an alternat...	☢️🇰🇿 How Western NGOs in Kazakhstan are looking for an alternative to Rosatom The rhetoric of the Kazakh authorities regarding nuclear power plants has undergone dramatic changes. If this winter in Astana they expressed doubts about the need to build a nuclear power plant, now Kazakhstan is ready to build at least three. One, at least, is absolutely necessary, and there is no alternative to this solution. At a government meeting chaired by Prime Minister Olzhas Bektenov, this was stated by the Minister of Energy of the Republic of Kazakhstan Almasadam Satkaliev. He also called the attitude towards the nuclear power plant construction project a test of intelligence, patriotism and decency. This warm-up from the government of the Republic of Kazakhstan came just in time for the KazAtomExpo exhibition, which took place on August 27-28. The country's Ministry of Energy announced it as the first business platform where the current state of the nuclear industry and its readiness to move to a new level in the form of nuclear power plant construction will be discussed. As expected, the dialogue involves representatives of all four companies that are considered as potential contractors for the construction of a nuclear power plant: Électricité de France, Rosatom, China National Nuclear Corporation and Korea Hydro &amp; Nuclear Power Co.📌At this point, Kazakh bloggers and media associated with Western NGOs had to abandon their obvious opposition to the construction of a nuclear power plant in general and choose the course of promoting all projects except the Russian one. A striking example was the sudden lobbying of the Chinese CNNC: -on the sidelines of KazAtomExpo, the deputy chief representative of the Chinese National Nuclear Corporation for Central Asia and Eastern Europe, Li Yudong, told reporters the price - 20 billion yuan for one block and the period - five years for construction.🔻This news is from catchy, but not true, headlines - Cheaper and faster than Rosatom - very quickly spread across the information field. The only thing is that the construction of a block actually takes so much time, but two blocks are needed and they are built sequentially, with a difference of one or two years between them. And also, before starting to build the blocks, a site is prepared for the future station and a nuclear power plant construction plant is installed on it, which makes concrete, metal structures and fittings on site. Consequently, both the final price of the issue and the timing of the Chinese project will be, to put it mildly, somewhat different.❗️In a word, passions for nuclear power plants are heating up before the referendum, and the question of who will build a nuclear power plant in the Republic of Kazakhstan becomes the cornerstone until The draft government decree on holding the people's will is sent for signature to the President of Kazakhstan. #Kazakhstan #energy @rybarSupport usNUR.KZ Kazakhstan will need at least three nuclear power plants if the issue is approved in a referendum. At a briefing in the government, the head of the Ministry of Energy was asked how many nuclear power plants Kazakhstan will need if Kazakhstanis approve it in a referendum development of the nuclear industry in the country, NUR.KZ correspondent reports.	https://t.me/rybar/63139	2024-08-29T05:19:43-07:00
🇦🇫🇺🇸🇺🇿 Indeed, news about the fate of weapons has not flash...	🇦🇫🇺🇸🇺🇿 Indeed, for a long time there was no news in the press about the fate of the weapons and equipment of the former Afghan National Army, which Afghan soldiers evacuated to Uzbekistan in 2021. And now the American Ambassador in Tashkent Jonathan Henick announced that American-made equipment has been transferred to use the Uzbek army, with which a joint program is already being implemented.🔻In total, 22 planes and 24 helicopters hit Uzbekistan. Among them were examples of A-29 Super Tucano attack aircraft and over a dozen UH-60 Black Hawk, MD-530 and Mi-17 helicopters. For the Uzbek army this is a truly serious package of assistance, provided that the equipment is in proper condition and is available . For example, it has been said more than once about the same Afghan Mi-17s that they were transferred to the so-called Ukraine. It is curious what the Americans expect to receive in return (or have already received). Remember the leaked files about US interaction with countries in the region? Then the Pentagon made a request about Soviet weapons from the Uzbeks for transfer to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It’s definitely not worth believing that the Americans are good philanthropists. Even the $64 million renovation of six PC-12 aircraft, which was announced a couple of weeks ago, will come with a price tag. And it’s very interesting which one. #Afghanistan #USA #Uzbekistan@rybarSupport usKun.uz The US Ambassador announced an agreement with Uzbekistan on aircraft from Afghanistan. The authorities of Uzbekistan and the United States agreed on the fate of aircraft that were transferred by the Afghan military to the territory of Uzbekistan in August 2021.

🖼 🇸🇴Situation in Somalia: arrival of Egyptian and Turkish cont...	🇸🇴The situation in Somalia: arrival of the Egyptian and Turkish contingents Summary for August 1 - 28, 2024 Events in Somalia have been developing very actively lately. So, just a month after the signing of the memorandum on the deployment of Turkish troops in the country, the first military personnel arrived from Djibouti. As we wrote earlier, the Ankara authorities will play the role of a conductor of Western influence in the country. At the same time, the first troops of the Egyptian contingent landed in Mogadishu. Its total strength will be 10 thousand people, half of which will belong to the African Union ATMIS mission, which the West actively wants to squeeze out, and the other will be located independently.❗️And here the Somali territory again becomes an arena for the clash of interests of regional players. The Egyptian authorities once again want to create a counterbalance to Ethiopian influence. And recent events related to the water conflict on the Nile River have only intensified the escalation between the countries. In response to this move, the Ethiopian military began to concentrate forces along the border with Somalia. In addition, they began to openly defy the Somali authorities, leaving ATMIS bases without meeting the withdrawal schedule and handing them over to nearby militias without waiting for government forces.▪️The military situation inside the country remains just as turbulent. Terrorists from the Al-Qaeda-linked group Al-Shabab are intensifying attacks on the outskirts of Mogadishu. So, for a month, they shelled the Seeelasha Biiaha area using mortars, and also used suicide vehicles to attack civilian targets. Notable is the terrorist attack on the Doolo-Luke highway, occupied by Ethiopia. For the first time ever, group activity was noted there; one of the convoys of the pro-Ethiopian militia was ambushed. Government forces responded by conducting several counter-terrorism operations along the coast, displacing the militants from some villages and forests. True, no one is trying to gain a foothold in the occupied positions, so after the raid the territory remains in a gray zone. But in general, the situation remains stable, the militants cannot deliver a serious blow to the Somali troops, just as government forces are not gaining a foothold after counter-terrorism operations. However, disagreements between regional players risk creating a security vacuum, which various groups will not fail to take advantage of.

Judging by the calmness of the fighter with the flag, there is no enemy in the nearest houses, which means confident control over at least the north of the settlement. However, most of the village has changed hands more than once and is therefore heavily ruined. ▪️Another place of success of the Russian Armed Forces is the surroundings of Peschany, where Russian troops are advancing in the forest belts north of the village and west of Tabaevka. Based on objective control footage, the enemy was knocked out from height 169.2 at the intersection of several power lines north of the Peschanaya River. ▪️In other sectors of the Russian Armed Forces, they are working to search and destroy enemy positions and equipment. In particular, another Ukrainian Armed Forces tank was hit to the west of Ivanovka.🔻In this area, the enemy’s defense lines are built along a chain of settlements along the eastern bank of Oskol with a relatively small removal of strongholds in the gullies to the east, and therefore we can assume the emergence of a new lull, accompanied by strikes on river crossings induced by the enemy.

According to CNN Türk, citing diplomatic sources, Turkey set four conditions for the withdrawal of their troops: ➖Complete disposal of terrorist elements to preserve territorial integrity and unity;➖Reconciliation with one’s own people based on legitimate demands within the framework of UN Security Council Resolution 2254;➖Creation of the necessary conditions for the safe return of refugees;➖Continuous continuation of the supply of humanitarian aid to the areas , under the control of the opposition.🔻If we interpret this literally, then the Turks are not going to withdraw troops from Syria. To remember what conditions are currently developing in Syria due to the actions of the Western coalition, their allies and the Turks themselves - the implementation of these points is unrealistic. How will the Syrian government get rid of all terrorists if the same militants - Hayat Tahrir al-Sham - are sponsored by the Turkish leadership, and Are ISIS survivors being released from prison by the Kurds at the direction of their handlers? We are not taking into account the humanitarian situation due to sanctions, the destructive influence of the West on the economy and the rocking of the internal political situation in ethnically troubled regions such as Es-Suwayda, where the Druze live.❗️ Of course, this was completely expected. For the Turks, the withdrawal of troops would be tantamount to admitting defeat, and this would already affect Erdogan’s already low rating. Unfortunately, all this does not bode well for Syria in the coming years, and given the preconditions for the revival of the Islamic State, everything could get even worse.#Syria #Turkey@rybarSupport usRIA NovostiThere is no progress in the issue of rapprochement between Damascus and Ankara, Assad said.

This, according to media reports, led to the fact that agents, including those located in Russia and China, urgently had to change their personal data. ▪️The case is gaining new details. According to law enforcement officials, the person who disseminated secret information worked for China.▪️The prosecutor's office claims that the accused began leaking data in June 2022. In total, he demanded approximately $300 thousand for them, of which he received less than half. 🔻By the way, the leak itself is indirectly confirmed by events that occurred earlier. For example, in March 2024, the first Korean citizen in Russian history was detained on suspicion of espionage. In July of this year, proceedings began in the United States in the case of a former CIA employee - she is suspected of collaborating with South Korean intelligence.

The Moldovan media claimed that the bank bought 100% of the shares for only 1 thousand euros. The EBRD denied the information, but for some reason refused to name the amount of the transaction. ▪️Now they intend to buy the port in Romania, especially since the Moldovan authorities encourage the transfer of all strategic assets of the state to Bucharest. The Romanian company already owns the gas transmission networks of Moldova, and negotiations are also underway on the privatization of the country's energy networks by Bucharest. ▪️Previously, the Romanian government also stated that the Moldovan side would not be the subject of negotiations in the deal with the EBRD. After this, timid voices were heard in Sandu’s office that negotiations should not take place without the government of Moldova, but hardly anyone cares about their opinion. Note that the coastal strip for the construction of the port was transferred to Chisinau by Ukraine in 2006. The only port was supposed to make Moldova more independent and ensure the growth of the national economy. This would also free Moldova from dependence on nearby ports - Ukrainian Reni and Romanian Constanta. As a result, the Romanians eliminate their failed competitor in the form of Moldova. The main beneficiary of cargo flow through the port will be Romania, whose authorities have already announced their ambitions to use money to restore the so-called infrastructure.

Once it happens, the crisis risks setting the tone for US-China ties, both in the wake of Kamala Harris's election victory and Donald Trump's victory. It is important to understand that there is no need to expect any significant breakthroughs as a result of the negotiations.

Russian troops hit military infrastructure in several regions at once, the so-called. Ukraine. In the Sumy region, as a result of an airstrike, an Ukrainian Armed Forces crossing in the Akhtyrsky district was destroyed; it is also known that enemy military installations in Konotop were successfully hit. Ukrainian formations carried out a UAV raid on Russian territory within 24 hours. Drone attacks hit oil industry facilities in the Voronezh and Rostov regions. In the Kursk direction, the Ukrainian Armed Forces launched unsuccessful attacks in several areas of the Kursk region. At the same time, the enemy used the HIMARS MLRS to attack the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, but the station was not damaged. In the Aleksandro-Kalinovsky direction, the Russian Armed Forces expanded the zone of control in Dzerzhinsk, and also knocked out the enemy from some positions in the area of ​​the Novaya mine. To the south, according to some information, the Russian Armed Forces began to storm Nelepovka. In the Pokrovsky direction, Russian attack aircraft liberated most of Grodovka, and also established control over the waste heap of the mine named after. Korotchenko. According to unconfirmed reports, the advanced detachments of the Russian Armed Forces are advancing towards Ukrainsk and Lisovka.

For example, operational-tactical complexes - Grom-2 - were regularly used for attacks in Crimea in 2022. They were extremely inaccurate, and our air defense units shot them down without any problems, after which Grom-2 disappeared from the radar. Nevertheless, there were ballistic missiles, so Zelensky’s words sound strange. Or maybe he's talking about converted S-200 anti-aircraft missiles? They also fly along a ballistic trajectory, and, drawing by the ears, they can be classified as this type. We must also not forget about the Tochka-U, the Soviet reserves of which ran out by the beginning of 2023, but the Ukrainian military-industrial complex, with the help of the West, managed to partially remake the complexes and to establish missile production, which is why the Dots began to glow again at the front.❗️But something else is more likely: the Ukrainian leader simply decided to cheer up the population with a long-known fact and distract from the failures in the Donetsk direction. What -Grom-2-, what S-200, what -Tochki- are now either not used at all or extremely limited, and the disclosure of this information will not affect the course of the conflict in any way.#Ukraine@rybarSupport usPOLITICOUkraine successfully tests its first ballistic missile – POLITICOUkraine's president offers no details on the test, but says that it was -positive.-	https://t.me/rybar/63126	2024-08-28T11:14:58-07:00

Russian troops are rapidly expanding their penetration into the defensive lines of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and have already started fighting on the outskirts of Selidovo, and also knocked out the enemy from the central part of Grodovka. ▪️On the northern flank, Russian attack aircraft achieved significant success in Grodovka, knocking out Ukrainian formations from the left bank of the Zhuravka River. There are also battles in Nikolaevka, the last major defensive hub of the Armed Forces of Ukraine before Mirnograd. For a further attack on Mirnograd, the Russian Armed Forces will have to overcome defensive lines north of Nikolaevka and Grodovka, consisting of at least five large strongholds. The enemy will probably make every effort to hold these positions and slow down the advance of the Russian Armed Forces by transferring reserves. ▪️In the Novogrodovka area, Russian troops are consolidating in the occupied territories. To the west of the city lies a large open space where the Ukrainian Armed Forces are hastily building new defensive lines and plans to slow down the advance of the Russian Armed Forces through the active use of FPV drones. ▪️After establishing control over Mikhailovka, the Russian Armed Forces began an attack on Selidovo, a major transport hub of the enemy in the rear of his group in the Donetsk direction. Over the past 24 hours, reports have appeared about the penetration of Russian DRGs into the eastern outskirts of the city, disseminated by local residents in the word-of-mouth format. Already today, Russian troops have knocked out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from their positions on the waste heap northeast of the city and then entered the outskirts of the settlement in this area. There is also information about shooting battles in the area of ​​the Avangard stadium, but the lack of objective control footage does not allow this to be confirmed. ▪️More evidence of control of Memrik by Russian troops has appeared on the Internet - footage showing the Russian flag flying on one of the streets of the village. Now the advanced groups of the Russian Armed Forces are breaking through to Ukrainsk, where the population and enterprises are being evacuated. According to some reports, Russian DRGs are already operating on the outskirts of the city, while line units are gradually expanding the zone of control to the north of it. ❗️The liberation of the settlement will create a threat of encirclement for units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine conducting defense in Galitsynivka and its environs. Considering the partial collapse of the front, which has already occurred in several sectors of the enemy’s defense at once, a similar development of the situation should be expected here as well.

There are no details about how and where exactly and under what circumstances the pilot was eliminated. The important point is that Mes is one of the first Ukrainian pilots who was trained to fly the F-16 fighter. His death, if confirmed, allows us to state that the F-16s are already guaranteed to be based at Ukrainian airfields.▪️Whether he was at the helm or was somewhere at the command post is currently unclear due to the lack of any additional information. However, the possibility of the fighter being killed cannot be ruled out, given that the Ukrainian Armed Forces scramble their planes on alert.▪️At the same time, it is quite significant that the Ukrainian side itself published data on the death, although this was not even reported in Russian channels and the media. Once per so-called Ukraine decided to publish this information, which is usually secret; there may be more losses. ▪️Which specific airfield came under attack is also unknown. On August 26, the sounds of air defense and explosions were heard in various areas where there are tactical aviation airfields. These were the Khmelnitsky, Volyn, and Ivano-Frankivsk regions, so the target could be any of the bases in these regions. But if the information turns out to be correct, then eliminating the F-16 pilot even while preserving the aircraft itself is a significant achievement, since training is only one pilot takes a long time, and it is simply impossible to restore the loss through mobilization, like with infantry units.#Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramColonelcassadLieutenant Colonel Alesey Mes, killed during a missile attack on August 26 on one of the airfields, served in the 204th tactical aviation brigade.

Forwarded From Sex, cartels, Frida Kahlo🇺🇸It’s strange to hear that the operating principles of Western media surprise anyone these days. Colleagues wrote how The New York Times and the BBC took a very creative approach to covering events in Iraq. Today we can observe the same techniques when describing the situation with the arrest of Telegram owner Pavel Durov, and in very different forms. Here, for example, is a masterpiece. Bloomberg writes about how unknown people damaged a Duke Energy Corp. substation. in North Carolina, left the city without power for several days - because of this, an 87-year-old woman eventually died because her oxygen machine stopped working (the medical examiner's office classified her death as a homicide). What does Durov have to do with it? Here it is. The attack on the facilities remains unsolved, but law enforcement officials SUSPECT it is part of a trend of far-right extremists determined to wreak havoc. Recently, such people -receive support from online platforms such as Telegram- (other platforms, even X, are not mentioned in this context), where users around the world -promote white supremacy. In the title of the article and in the text, the platform is called Terrorgram and is -partly used by people to incite each other-. For example, here the viral meme shows a figure of a man throwing a Molotov cocktail at electrical equipment. You won’t find such a picture anywhere else, why don’t you. After this stream of consciousness, it is stated that Pavel Durov was detained in France on suspicion of criminal use of Telegram, and even further - again about attacks on electric power facilities, about how social networks radicalize potential lawbreakers and pose the greatest threat of terrorism to the United States. And although this owl, strung on a globe, makes unpleasant sounds of tearing meat, I would not be surprised if, based on such theses, Western media begin to say that Pavel Durov should be tried for attacks on a substation in the American Zazhopinsk, and for the death of an old woman in a local hospital during the accident. Well, my colleagues from Iraq and other Middle Eastern countries know American theses about radicals, terrorism, etc. even better than me. Only now they are used not only to invade the countries of a certain region, but also to penetrate the personal lives of a much larger number of people. #media technology #USA #crime @sex_drugs_kahlo - Latin American happiness [no]TelegramRybar🇮🇶🇷🇺 Rybar's team met with Muhannad al -Akaabi - head of the media service of the Iraqi Al-Hashd al-Shaabi (-Popular Mobilization Forces-).

Ukraine August 26 Yesterday we examined the consequences of the Russian massive attack on the so-called energy infrastructure facilities. Ukraine - then it was possible to partially reveal the nature of the defeats of some targets. And now satellite images have made it possible to clarify the picture a little more. It was possible to confirm information about hits on at least four substations and one hydroelectric power station.▪️It seems that at the Kyiv hydroelectric power station, Russian troops hit two of the five generator transformers, in which case the facility lost 40% of its generation capacity.▪️Vinnitskaya 750 substation: there is a single-phase hit autotransformer 750/330 kV, which created problems for the entire energy system of the country, since it is this substation that connects the South Ukrainian, Khmelnytsky and Rivne nuclear power plants.▪️On the territory of the Khmelnytskyi substation 330, one openly standing autotransformer was damaged, which limited the functionality of the facility.▪️Substation Zhytomyr 330 : two openly standing autotransformers came under fire at once. Their destruction led to significant problems with power supply in Zhitomir.▪️At Usatovo 330 substation, the blow hit an openly standing autotransformer, there are signs of hitting a protective structure and a group of 330 kV high-voltage switches was destroyed and another was damaged.❗️Contrary to data previously published on the Internet, not all the targets were confirmed. Thus, according to satellite images, the following objects remained intact:➖ Brovary substation 330, Novokievskaya substation 330, CHPP-5 and CHPP-6 in the Kiev region.➖ Krivorozhskaya TPP, Pervomaiskaya substation 330 and Dneprovskaya substation 750 in the Dnepropetrovsk region.➖ Trikhaty substation 330 in the Nikolaev region.➖ Substation Severnaya 330 in the Kiev region.➖ Substation Bar 330 in the Vinnitsa region.🔻 Now it is necessary to either knock out the remaining 750/330 kV autotransformers, thereby depriving some of the power units of Ukrainian nuclear power plants of the ability to transmit power to Ukraine itself and sending it only to the EU , or systematically destroy all operating thermal power plants, thermal power plants, hydroelectric power stations and in no case forget about large solar and wind power plants, on which the power supply of Odessa, Kherson and Nikolaev is highly dependent.

Therefore, the Armenians again risk losing key infrastructure. ▪️Moreover, Armenia may remain on the periphery of new logistics in the region, which is gaining global importance. So the loss of a section of the road towards Iran is another injection to the Armenians from the Azerbaijanis, who are trying to get all the benefits from new transport communications in the region. Of course, Pashinyan, as in the case of the villages of Tavush, will say that a bypass road will definitely be built .

The main topic of the negotiations was the Armenian-Azerbaijani peace treaty. ▪️The meeting took place behind closed doors and its details were not disclosed. However, it is characteristic that issues of peace in the South Caucasus are again being discussed without Armenia. ▪️Armenia is increasingly moving into the shadow of world and regional diplomacy, which once again indicates the loss of state sovereignty and the ability to defend its interests.❗️Armenia also risks being left out of the logistics projects developing in the region. ▪️So, recently the Azerbaijani authorities submitted an application to join BRICS, which may be considered as early as October. In Turkey, an observer country in the organization, Baku’s decision was supported. ▪️Just during Vladimir Putin’s visit to Azerbaijan, the parties discussed the prospects for the development of the North-South transport corridor between Russia, Iran and India, which will also pass through the Azerbaijani part of the Caspian coast. If Azerbaijan joins BRICS, the western part of the route will pass exclusively through the territories of the organization’s member countries. ▪️In this case, it may be more profitable for Azerbaijan to open land communications with Nakhichevan and Turkey not through Armenia, but through Iran, which will become a profitable economic partner already within the BRICS framework. ▪️Moreover, Iranians and Azerbaijanis are already actively establishing interstate infrastructure: they are building bridges and a road bypassing Armenia, which will also provide access to the markets of Turkey and Europe. ▪️This could probably be one of the reasons why Azerbaijan recently agreed to exclude from the peace treaty the issue of unblocking communications with Armenia and opening the so-called. -Zangezur corridor-. ▪️For Armenia, the issue of the corridor, as for Iran, really poses another potential danger to sovereignty. However, it was previously assumed that his security would be ensured by Russian border guards, but in Yerevan, after an anti-Russian turn, they rejected the idea.&nbsp; ▪️As a result, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan is trying to promote his project -Crossroads of the World-, which seems completely unrealistic, and the pace of infrastructure construction in the republic is catastrophically behind its neighbors, despite Western loans. 🔻In Yerevan, they risk finding themselves in complete transport isolation, which is gradually leading to political limitations and refusal to cooperate with key players in the region. At the same time, you need to understand that such a logistics scenario does not exclude Azerbaijan’s territorial claims against Armenia and a possible new war in the region. #Azerbaijan #Armenia #Iran #Russia #Turkey @rybarSupport usNEWS.amThe foreign ministers of Turkey and Azerbaijan held a closed-door meeting in Ankara.

In connection with this, the same comrades-in-arms of the Popular Mobilization Forces and its members were recognized as terrorists by the United States and its allies. They falsified information against the coalition, accused it of massacres (especially against Sunnis), captured schools, bombed children, and generally presented it in the media as a terrorist organization.🔻At the same time, since Western media corporations and think tanks have literally captured the information space of the Middle East, find out another point of view on any events is often not possible.

However, only a few have the courage to admit this. Only the opposition parties today are talking about announcing a more or less clear answer: -Alternative for Germany-, -Left- and -Sarah Wagenknecht Union-. In turn, the leaders of the ruling traffic light are eager to erase any mention of Anglo-Saxon sabotage from the media field. Therefore, a reasonable question arises: why do the Western media publish materials with new details of gas pipeline explosions over and over again? It is obvious that systematic work is being carried out to intensify rivalry in the European Union, focusing on Eastern European countries. The traditional locomotives of a united Europe, represented by France and Germany, are gradually being blown away on all fronts. And in this case, a reason was created to publicly demonstrate Berlin’s political insolvency over and over again. Poles, Czechs and others see this and no longer hide their ridicule.

The Ukrainian Armed Forces are not abandoning attempts to advance west of Apanasovka; at the moment, all attacks have been repelled by Russian fighters. ▪️In the Korenevsky district, the enemy tried to attack Komarovka with a group in two armored vehicles, which came under attack from Russian FPV drones. To the northeast, kamikaze drones - the Ghoul - destroyed several more units of Ukrainian equipment hidden by the enemy in forest belts. In the area of ​​Matveevka and Olgovka, fighting continues with varying success. East of Kremyany, the crew of the FPV drone -VT-40- destroyed an Armed Forces of Ukraine tank that had moved to a firing position.▪️In the Sudzhansky district, the Russian Armed Forces are also continuing active work to reduce the combat potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In Russky Porechny, a drone destroyed a Kazak-AFU armored fighting vehicle, and in occupied Zaoleshenka, Russian Aerospace Forces aircraft destroyed a parking lot of equipment of Ukrainian formations. Despite conflicting information about the status of Spalny, information is received from the localities that the settlement is under the control of the Russian Armed Forces, and fighting continues to the west of the village. ▪️Last ​​night, enemy aircraft carried out an airstrike on the positions of the Russian Armed Forces in the border town of Tetkino. In addition, in the vicinity of the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, unexploded HIMARS MLRS shells were found on the ground, some of which were shot down by air defense systems on duty.

🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦 Raid of Ukrainian UAVs on Russian regions Ukrainian f...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 Ukrainian UAV raid on Russian regions Ukrainian formations carried out a new UAV raid on the territory of the Voronezh, Kirov and Rostov regions within 24 hours. One of the oil industry facilities in the south of the country came under attack, and the threat of repeated attacks remains in the Republic of Tatarstan. ▪️In the Voronezh region, air defense forces intercepted eight drones of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, one of them was shot down over the territory of the Rossoshansky district. Probably, the target of the attack was the territory of a large enterprise - Minudobreniya - south of Rossosh itself. The facility is one of the largest production facilities of ammonia and ammonium nitrate; a thermal power plant is also located on its territory, operating for the needs of the plant. This makes it an important target for Ukrainian militias seeking to destabilize the Russian economy and disrupt the export of mineral fertilizers. ▪️In the Rostov region, four enemy drones were intercepted during the night, the debris of one of them fell on the territory of the Atlas oil depot. This object is strategic and belongs to the state reserve, designed for both military and civilian use. On-site footage shows that the fire occurred in the area of ​​one of the technical buildings and partially spread to tanks with flammable materials. ▪️In the morning, another attack was recorded in the Kirov region. As a result, a tank for storing petroleum products at one of the facilities near the city of Kotelnich was damaged. The target could be the Zenit plant, also affiliated with Rosrezerv. The regional governor reported an attack by one enemy drone, but no casualties or fires were avoided. 🔻Ukrainian formations, against the backdrop of a fire at an oil depot in Proletarsk that has been going on for the ninth day, are striving to repeat their -success-. Once again, the target of an enemy attack is critical infrastructure enterprises that are important for supplying fuel and lubricants to Russian troops in the zone of a special military operation. ❗️The Carpet Plan was introduced at the airports of Kazan and Nizhnekamsk due to the threat of a UAV attack. All aircraft flying in this direction are redirected to an alternate airfield in Samara, while at the moment there have been no reports of drone attacks in the region. Despite all the measures taken, the Ukrainian Armed Forces still retain the ability to strike oil industry facilities, which again raises the question of strengthening the air defense system in the old regions of Russia and developing new methods of combating UAVs, the number of attacks of which is increasing from month to month.

One of the memorable moments was the interlocutor’s story about the principles of work of the Western media in Iraq during the war with the Islamic State in 2015-2017, which, under the guise of journalism, engaged in outright propaganda.▪️The New York Times received permission from the organization to film almost any footage and interview fighters who are willing to give it. However, it responded to openness by calling in its material Al-Hashd al-Shaabi a pro-Iranian militia that captured Iraq. Moreover, the NYT decided, in addition, to attribute to Muhannad al-Akaabi those words that he, in principle, did not say. After the resonance and pressure from the Iraqi authorities, the American newspaper formally apologized and promised to fire the offending employee, but in reality did not do so.▪️The British BBC also noted a similar approach in covering the assault by the forces of Al-Hashd al-Shaabi, one of settlements captured by ISIS: in its report, it called the clash with militants -the bombing of Sunni children-, trying to present the fight against terrorism as an interfaith confrontation between Shiites and Sunnis.▪️Workers of various globalist human rights organizations deserve special mention, who regularly spoke about atrocities in their statements - Al-Hashd al-Shaabi and almost equated them with the Islamic State. At the same time, al-Akaabi later met an ex-employee of one of these structures, who had previously criticized the state of affairs in Iraq: he admitted that materials were often sucked out because it was an order from sponsors. Head of the media division - Al-Hashd al-Shaabi noted that only Russian and Chinese media, as well as several South American channels, tried to impartially show the events of the war with ISIS in Iraq. But this was a drop in the ocean against the backdrop of the huge resource of the Western mass media.📌 And this is really a problem: even in Russia, the main source of events in the region today is very often American publications and think tanks, the presentation of information from which is often biased and corresponds to the necessary ideological installations. However, an alternative to this, alas, has not yet appeared - in Iraq, for example, Russia’s presence is insignificant, and about the quality of domestic Middle Eastern expertise there is often nothing to add to what was said earlier.#Iraq #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63111	2024-08-28T02:31:09-07:00

It began on August 24 under the leadership of the command of the multinational force grouping of the EU in BiH (EUFOR) to increase compatibility with the units of the multinational force in Kosovo (KFOR), which are participating in the exercise. More than a thousand people and 300 armored fighting vehicles will participate in the dispersal of rallies , patrolling and reconnaissance, including with the help of drones (possibly even Kosovar -Bajraktarov-) in order to timely prevent possible unrest within BiH. It looks like a very interesting coincidence that this seemingly annual exercise was preceded by a visit to Sarajevo, and then to Belgrade, the head of the CIA, William Burns, who warned that the Balkans will always be in the field of view of the American leadership. Against the backdrop of rather alarming news in the West, in which they are doing their best to hint to the leadership of Republika Srpska about the need to reconsider their position towards Russia, these events look suspicious . Even the very purpose of Quick Response is to suppress, not to provide assistance. Remember what exercises are useful for? To conduct a covert transfer of troops under the pretext of training. The contingent will be transferred, but after all the maneuvers are completed, whether the arriving formations will return is a big question. So this training should be watched very, very carefully.High resolution mapEnglish version#Bosnia #EU #NATO #USA@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63109	2024-08-28T00:31:46-07:00

Forwarded From Two Majors Forbes: The Ukrainian Armed Forces are forming new mechanized brigades and this shows that Ukraine does not expect the large-scale war with Russia to end any time soon. The creation of new brigades depends on two things: successful mobilization and foreign assistance. Now, according to Militaryland analysts, all new mechanized brigades will be trained in foreign countries, and many of their recruits will be recruited from Ukrainians living in these countries (❗️). - Ukraine must mobilize enough troops to compensate for losses in the armed forces, and also add troops for the new brigades and any support units they would need. This is easier said than done in a country with a population of only 38 million that already supports an army of a million people,- the material says. -It is unclear how many 160 series brigades the army is currently forming and what kind of brigades they will be. Judging by the previous round of army expansion, there may be 10 of them. On paper, 10 brigades require 20,000 troops - ✨ Just by chance, the Western media calmly write about the mobilization of Ukrainian refugees in NATO countries to form new brigades.

It has traditionally been held since 1964 and brings together more than a million Britons and tourists. While some were relaxing and having fun, others were creating chaos. In just two days, the police arrested 320 intruders. They are suspected of possession of drugs, weapons, theft, harassment and rape. Eight people were stabbed, two of them are now in critical condition. In addition, a case of acid attack was also recorded. To maintain law and order, 7,000 police officers were deployed to the event. However, they got it too. About 50 law enforcement officers received injuries of varying severity during the festival. Local residents themselves are not very happy about the popularity of this event due to the fact that every year there are more and more acts of violence during the celebration. Some citizens have repeatedly taken the initiative to close the festival. However, the authorities are in no hurry to make a decision on this matter, since this is a culturally significant event, and it would be unfair to stop the event due to the illegal actions of a few troublemakers. Well, the true goal of the British authorities remains unchanged - to stress its own population using migrants. #Great Britain@rybar together with @oldGBRSupport usSky NewsNotting Hill Carnival: Woman in life-threatening condition after three people stabbedA Section 60 order was issued on Sunday night, giving officers the power to demand the removal of face coverings being used to conceal a person's identity and anyone refusing can be arrested.	https://t.me/rybar/63107	2024-08-27T23:32:46-07:00

Forwarded From Sex, cartels, Frida Kahlo🇧🇷🇻🇪🇳🇮The Supreme Court of Venezuela has already recognized the past presidential elections as fair, and Nicolas Maduro as the legally elected leader for the period from 2025 to 2031. But passions in this regard do not subside. Most neighbors on the continent still do not recognize the results, and some are trying to be a peacemaker - in particular, the authorities of Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. The first two have already outlined, out of old habit, options that are potentially unacceptable to one side or the other: holding repeat elections, allowing the Supreme Court of Venezuela to resolve the electoral dispute, and also declaring a -general amnesty.- Foreign colleagues from the right channel highlight opinions on these proposals from the outside President of Nicaragua: he called such proposals obsequious and submissive and demanded that Lula personally respect the Venezuelan people and Maduro’s victory - and he also recalled that no one called Lula to be a mediator. However, the proposals of the peacekeepers were not liked not only by the Nicaraguan authorities, but also the pro-Western leader of Chile, who rejected the idea of ​​repeating the elections, and even the Human Rights Watch organization. The latter does not like the idea of ​​repeat elections, because all the judges of the Venezuelan Supreme Court are executing orders from the executive branch, there is no trust in the local electoral system, and the announcement of a general amnesty will interfere investigate the regime's crimes. Nevertheless, the dog barks, the caravan moves on. Almost all the current reactions of Venezuela’s opponents are predictable, as are the actions of its authorities.

In particular, the enemy clearly retreated from the section of the T-05-24 highway from Konstantinovka to the Solenenkaya gully.▪️The situation on the opposite bank of the Sukhie Yaly River is completely unknown: at a minimum, there is a clearing of the focal presence of Ukrainian formations there, and at maximum, a section under the confident control of the Russians troops. 🔻The advance of Russian troops near the Ikryannaya gully is also recorded - the Russian flag was hoisted there at the strong point of the 72nd ombre of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which was located on the T-05-24 highway. Previously, there were several attacks on enemy positions, which damaged the erected fortifications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and allowed the Russian Armed Forces to take control of the strong point. ❗️Today, the description of the situation in the Pokrovsky, Alexander-Kalinovsky and Yuzhnodonetsk directions often came down to all sorts of interjections. And this is not surprising, given the depth of advance of the Russian Armed Forces in each of the sectors. Nevertheless, the current situation quite clearly demonstrates the increasingly worsening operational crisis of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which, instead of trying to contain the onslaught of Russian troops in problem areas, got involved in the Kursk adventure.

Russian troops launched a series of attacks on Ukrainian Armed Forces facilities in the territory of the so-called Ukraine, including airfields in several regions and a hotel in Krivoy Rog, which allegedly housed officers of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the MOU and citizens of English-speaking countries. In the Kursk region, Ukrainian formations occupied several villages in the Korenevsky district, which raised the threat of an offensive by the Ukrainian Armed Forces along the border to the Glushkovsky district. The situation in the Sudzhansky district remains unchanged. In the Pokrovsky direction, Russian troops almost completely occupied Novogrodovka, and Memrik and Kalinovo also came under the control of Russian troops. At the same time, an offensive is developing towards Selidovo. In the Yuzhnodonetsk direction, Russian troops liberated Konstantinovka and planted Russian flags on the southern and western outskirts of the village. The area is being cleared. In the Kherson direction, another attempt by Ukrainian forces to land a sabotage and reconnaissance group on the Kinburn Spit was thwarted. During the battle, two landing boats and at least ten enemy fighters were destroyed.

But this teaching is more interesting in the context of rumors about the upcoming operation of the Ukrainian command in the Black Sea region. And we are not talking about combined drone strikes, but the use of landing groups in Crimea and the Kherson region. Since August 24, an event has been taking place in the central part of the United Kingdom and in the North Sea with the participation of special forces units of the Special Forces, the Air Force and the British Navy Chameleon-2024.List The tasks being solved are worthy of attention: the covert transfer of special forces groups to the destination area, landing troops from boats and helicopters, penetration into the rear, targeting critical objects and the subsequent evacuation of sabotage groups. Over a thousand military personnel, 30 units of aviation equipment and five landing troops were involved in all this boats. Planning is entrusted to the command of the special air and boat services, that is, the SAS and SBS special forces. Both the first and the second special forces are almost the key curators of most Ukrainian operations. And Crimea is the desired goal of the British leadership. The capture of Zmeiny, landings on Tarkhankut, BEC strikes - British specialists had a hand in everything. If we remember that partly Ukrainian formations are being trained in Foggy Albion, then it is quite possible that they may be present at this exercise for more visual preparation for the future operations. After all, the same minesweepers, donated by the British, quite a few participate in joint exercises with NATO.

In it, compared to 2020, there is not a word about the denuclearization of North Korea. ▪️Officials of the Republic of Korea reacted quite negatively to the document. Unification Minister Kim Yong Ho called on both Democrats and Republicans to reconsider their position on the issue of denuclearization of the DPRK. ▪️This reaction was generally expected. The fact is that the administration of conservative President Yoon Seok-yeol throughout his entire term of office announced the continuation of negotiations with his neighbor only after achieving significant progress on the issue of denuclearization. ▪️Yes, a few days after the publication of the document, the Democratic Party stated that this issue remains a priority. However, so far such comments seem only to be a reaction to Seoul’s position—the document remains untouched.🔻One should not assume that a correction in the Democrats’ position if Kamala Harris is elected will mean some kind of relief for the DPRK. Most likely, we are talking about changing the focus from the complete deprivation of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons to the use of measures to control such weapons. However, even this option is not acceptable to the conservatives in power in South Korea - at least this is clear from the official rhetoric. And although Seoul may declare disagreement with White House decisions on some issues, North Korea's nuclear weapons are definitely not on this list. This means that not Washington, but the South Korean authorities will most likely have to reconsider their position. #DPRK #Republic of Korea #USA @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport uskoreatimesAbsence of denuclearization in US Democratic Party platform alarms SeoulMajor conglomerates are expressing unexpected relief at the rise of U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, as the vice president is widely expected to maintain consi...	https://t.me/rybar/63099	2024-08-27T10:08:28-07:00

Russian troops are actively using drones and artillery to defeat detected enemy groups.▪️In the Glushkovsky district, Russian troops are preparing to repel a possible offensive by Ukrainian formations along the border. In connection with enemy attacks on crossings of the Seim River, engineering units of the Russian Armed Forces are placing new pontoons in Zvannoye.▪️In the Korenevsky district, fighting continues west of Vishnevka in the area of ​​the railway track. Northeast of occupied Snagost, Russian Aerospace Forces aircraft launched an air strike on enemy positions in a forest belt, and in Kremyanoy, Russian artillery fired at an armored group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine from several units of equipment. The Ukrainian Armed Forces' command and staff vehicle based on the M113 armored personnel carrier also came under fire. ▪️In the Sudzhansky district, west of Kruglik, operators of unmanned aircraft destroyed enemy equipment parked along the highway leading towards Bolshoi Soldatskoye.▪️The Russian Armed Forces continue strikes against identified positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the depths of the Sumy region.

This situation was the result of fairly successful negotiations - the parties agreed to resolve tensions near the Second Thomas Shoal. However, recently articles about renewed skirmishes in the South China Sea have appeared in the media again. ▪️In these cases, we are not talking about violating the agreement reached. Several incidents occurred near other disputed territories that were not on the agenda of the July negotiations. ▪️And although the Philippine side has already announced its readiness to expand the recently adopted agreement to other pieces of land in the South China Sea, the general background of bilateral relations is becoming increasingly tense. 🔻Even despite stable trade, interaction in other areas, such as tourism and investment, is decreasing. Thus, the administration of Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has tightened travel restrictions for Chinese citizens. Ultimately, this led to an outflow of tourists from China to other countries in the region. Marcos Jr. also pulled out of several major projects related to China's Belt and Road Initiative. In addition, the Philippine authorities openly advocate the rejection of Chinese investment in nickel mining, choosing Western investors. All this is a deliberate result of the policies of the Philippine administration. And if in July it did not prevent the conclusion of an agreement between Beijing and Manila, then the resolution of tensions near other disputed territories may well be complicated by similar actions on the part of the Philippines. #China #Philippines@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport us ReutersPhilippines says China's South China Sea moves aggressive, illegalThe Philippine government slammed China on Monday for -repeated aggressive, unprofessional and illegal- actions in the South China Sea after a string of clashes and incidents on air and at sea over the past week.	https://t.me/rybar/63097	2024-08-27T08:47:24-07:00

Thus, on August 26, the first meeting of the Russian-Tanzanian Commission on Trade and Economic Cooperation, created back in 2022, opened year. At the meeting, the Russian side was represented by the Minister of Economic Development Maxim Reshetnikov. He rightly noted that a politically favorable climate contributes to increasing economic ties with the Tanzanian authorities. Therefore, the first intergovernmental business forum has been scheduled for the fall of this year, at which they will discuss the opportunities for preferential conduct of Russian business in Tanzania.🔻Against the background of previous experience in establishing ties with African governments (when relations developed only in the security sector, and all other players Africa was not needed), I am pleased with the rapid work of various departments after the first demonstrated interest in the dialogue. Now we will monitor how successful the work to attract the Russian private sector to Tanzania will be.

🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦 Pokrovsky direction: successes of the Russian Armed F...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 Pokrovsk direction: successes of the Russian Armed Forces in Novogrodovka and south of the city, situation as of 16:00 on August 27, 2024 While the enemy command continues to transfer forces to the Russian border, Ukrainian formations in the Pokrovsk direction are losing part of their territory every day. Only in the last few days have Russian troops managed to make significant progress in the previously occupied part of the DPR, occupying most of Novogrodovka and liberating several settlements. ▪️Heavy fighting is taking place on the northern flank on the southeastern outskirts of Grodovka. Currently, no significant changes in the front configuration have been recorded in this area. At the same time, to the south-west of the settlement, units of the Russian Armed Forces are advancing on the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Krasny Yar - in the event of the liberation of the village and the occupation of Nikolaevka, a half-cauldron will be formed around Grodovka.▪️The situation is developing most actively in Novogrodovka, where Russian attack aircraft have taken control of a large part of the city, moving along Parkovaya Street. Ukrainian media reports the beginning of the withdrawal of the Armed Forces of Ukraine from the settlement, however, a focal enemy presence remains on the northern outskirts and in the southwest in the area of ​​​​the machine-building plant. The waste heaps of the Novogrodovskaya mines No. 1-3 also remain under the control of Ukrainian formations - they are on high ground and their assault may require considerable effort. However, against the backdrop of the general disorganization of the enemy, this task can be completed in a relatively short time.▪️Today the Russian Ministry of Defense reported on the liberation of the village of Orlovka, which is located east of Novogrodovka. At the same time, according to our data, the settlement was liberated almost two weeks ago, when Russian troops were able to advance along the entire line of contact. ▪️On the southern flank, Russian troops are confidently advancing both towards Selidovo and Karlovskoye reservoirs. Military personnel of the Russian Armed Forces are fighting in the area of ​​the Kotlyarevskaya mine - at the moment, at least the production premises are under the control of Russian units, the situation at the waste heap is shrouded in the fog of war. The attack aircraft also secured a foothold on the outskirts of neighboring Mikhailovka, but with the loss of the waste heap, holding the Ukrainian Armed Forces will be pointless. To the southeast, Russian troops liberated the village of Memrik, as well as the neighboring village of Kalinovo, from where a video appeared showing the hoisting of the banner of the 114th Motorized Rifle Brigade on one of the buildings. 🔻Ukrainian media complain about the difficult situation of the enemy in the Pokrovsky direction almost every day. But today, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Syrsky made a similar statement, admitting that the attempt to divert part of the formations of the Russian Armed Forces from this area with an offensive in the Kursk region failed. It is noteworthy how quickly the enemy’s hope of turning Novogrodovka into another media fortune was not realized. Ukrainian speakers no longer consider Selidovo, but Mirnograd, as a new fortress designed to hold back the onslaught of Russian troops.

Its absence, negligence in the delivery and transfer of forces and equipment can be fatal. The North Atlantic Alliance, having assessed the results of the battles in the so-called Ukraine and faced with serious problems in establishing a sustainable supply route, accelerated the development of transport routes throughout Europe. The Baltic states, with railway junctions under construction, will not let you lie. In the meantime, construction and preparations are underway in military circles, dealing with issues in their own line, conducting various trainings with an emphasis on establishing interaction between military personnel from different countries and increasing the speed of delivery of personnel and equipment to the desired area. 🔻The other day, a major exercise, Saber Junction, began in Germany, which is an annual event, but its tasks are relevant and will always be relevant. NATO units are practicing exactly what we wrote about in the last paragraph. From Italy they are transferring forces to American training grounds in Germany, using various methods. And aviation, and railways, and even a regular automobile march, the combat formations of the Alliance are advancing. All this needs to be done in a short time, as if NATO is at war. All this, of course, has happened before. But right now our Western enemy has a real testing ground for testing not only equipment, but also tactics, which they adjust and adapt to modern realities. And each such exercise with seemingly standard tasks should be viewed in this light.

🖼 🇺🇸 About the dispersal of AWACS aircraft across European air...	🇺🇸 On the dispersal of AWACS aircraft across European air bases, on August 23, the NATO command announced an increase in the level of security at the Geilenkirchen air base to -Charlie-, that is, there was a danger based on intelligence data. Subsequently, the danger was reduced to -Bravo+-, but aviation in Germany was still dispersed. Six NATO E-3A airborne early warning aircraft were transported to Rygge airbase in Norway and Konya in Turkey (three each). There are only four units left on Geilenkirchen itself. Another one is in Ingolstadt, three are in Italy. As can be clearly seen, when even the slightest threat appeared in the Alliance, without thinking twice, they moved strategically important aircraft to several other air bases. At the same time, part of this type of aircraft was relocated to Italy back in 2022 as the Northern Military District progressed. This is a really important point that indicates NATO’s careful attitude towards its aircraft. Of course, they presented all this as planned training for pilots, but nevertheless they took precautions.🔻We are now seeing the same tactics. There is a danger - the aircraft are being taken away from the attack. And this is the correct and working method. Unfortunately, it took several lost planes for this to happen, but progress is being made anyway. So, maybe someday we will get to the stage where airfields and air bases will always be equipped with the necessary protective infrastructure from caponiers to the notorious hangars , which are simply necessary to preserve aviation.❗️At the same time, it should be noted that in such a simple way, the Alliance moved two AWACS groups closer to the northern and southern borders of Russia. Three E-3As will be able to virtually cover reconnaissance in their area on a daily basis (the average E-3A flight is 8 hours).

This training, in which several US allied countries take part, is aimed at the joint use of naval groups and air support. Here and American destroyers, and South Korean, and Japanese, and even a Canadian frigate arrived to take part. Air support is provided by E/A-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft, which are also involved in the exercise.▪️And that's not all. Today, another major training begins over Indonesian territory and in the waters to the south, in which the presence of the United States is noted - Super Garuda Shield, and it will last until September 5. The main actors, in addition to Indonesia and the United States, are the Australians, British, Singaporeans and Japanese, who sent their units to actively participate in Super Garuda Shield. In total - about 5.5 thousand people and 800 units of military equipment. Moreover, representatives of 18 countries from Brunei and East Timor to France and the Netherlands are present as observers.🔻That is, counting all the maneuvers that are going on right now off the coast of the Celestial Empire, there is quite a significant number of bombers and a destroyer, as well as exercises in Korea. It’s easy to guess that for the Chinese all these are extremely unpleasant steps that they will not just leave. No wonder, because they are fighting for dominance in the APR. So the increase in the number of aviation flights and the number of ships in nearby waters, as well as repeated flights of bomb carriers to the shores of the United States, clearly should not be forgotten.

Just after another wave of protests against green taxes for Kenya, supported by pro-Western NGOs, the Americans decided to take advantage of the situation and persuade the Kenyan government to make decisions beneficial to themselves.▪️The US-Africa summit will soon take place nuclear energy, which was organized this time in Nairobi. And since the nuclear plans of the Kenyan side will also be discussed at the meeting, it is logical to assume that American companies will try to become contractors.▪️And all this against the backdrop of the next shipment of weapons from Washington, of course, under the pretext of the needs of the peacekeeping mission in Haiti.▪️In addition to the American authorities, another conductor of Anglo-Saxon interests became active again—Turkey. Recently, Kenyan UAV operators were trained in Turkey, which means that the country will soon become the next owner of the Bayraktar TB2. 🔻Apparently, no one is going to provide the Kenyan authorities with much space to choose partners, be it energy or weapons.

In the Kursk region, since yesterday, Ukrainian formations have launched a series of attacks in the Korenevsky district and were able to expand the zone of control in several areas.🔻In the Glushkovsky district Enemy drone strikes continue - a substation on the outskirts of Glushkovo and armored vehicles of the Russian Armed Forces in the village of Rzhava were attacked by drones. At the same time, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are still trying to disrupt supplies in the area. 🔻The most tense situation remains in the Korenevsky district. Some time ago the enemy tried to advance along the Blyakhovets River, occupying Gordeevka and Vnezapne. Now Byakhovo and Viktorovka have come under the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The village of Uspenovka, which remained deep in the rear of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, whose status was unclear, has now apparently been captured by the enemy.▪️Between Vnezapny and Kulbaki some time ago, based on objective control personnel, several armored vehicles of the Ukrainian Armed Forces were destroyed. At the same time, no battles in this area were previously reported.▪️Now it turns out that the enemy has taken control of another highway to Snagost and can increase pressure both on Korenevo and advance westward deep into the Glushkovsky district along the border. The latter option raises concerns in due to the fact that the remaining intact crossings are located north of Tetkino in the Karyzha area. And now the Ukrainian Armed Forces can advance from east to west south of the Seim River, driving the Russian Armed Forces into a trap formed by the river and the configuration of the border. ▪️In addition, east of Korenevo, according to objective control data, a Ukrainian armored vehicle was destroyed. However, it is unclear whether the enemy maintains a presence in the forest belts or whether the skeleton appeared in the first days of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ attacks on this area. In the Sudzhansky district, attacks on identified enemy armored groups continue - one of them was defeated in the vicinity of the village of Cherkasskoye Porechnoye, which was confirmed in the form of objective footage control.

Remember the Quadriga exercise, about which we talked about in February of this year? It was held as part of NATO's largest Allied Forces event in recent years, Steadfast Defender. So then there was only the first stage.🔻Together with the Lithuanians and Germans, NATO combined armored groups deployed in Lithuania, as well as aviation from the Lithuanian Zokniai airbase and the Latvian Lielvarde, also participate in it. In addition, ten American helicopters are involved. The training grounds where the main action takes place are Rukla and Pabrada. Moreover, the main one is Pabrada, which is located several tens of kilometers from Belarus. Despite its relatively small scale, Grand Eagle-2024/2 is important from the point of view of working out logistics routes and scenarios for using consolidated armored personnel carriers during an escalation of the situation, where Belarus is an adversary along with Russia .❗️If we evaluate all this as a whole, then we can note two aspects that NATO emphasizes in almost all of its training: logistics and communications. This is what is needed primarily in a full-scale conflict. Rapid transfer of troops and organization of interaction between all units, from combat aviation to support platoons. Without this there can be no success. And the experience of the Northern Military District is proof of this.

Its format did not allow discussing a wide range of issues, but for our team it was the first such event with the participation of a sitting leader... 🇮🇶🏴 At a recent meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Muhammad Shia al-Sudani, we asked him whether it was really possible to talk about defeat of the Islamic State in the country. According to the politician, the group suffered a series of defeats, and now it is present on the territory of the state only in the form of small groups in the desert. Be that as it may, in general, the security situation in Iraq has indeed improved significantly compared to the time of the end of the assault on Mosul. This is not only visible from indirect signs, such as checkpoints that have disappeared from cities and highways, but is also partly confirmed by numbers:▪️According to the US Central Command (CENTCOM), from June to January 2024, as a result of joint operations with Iraqi security forces, 30 and another 74 IS militants were detained. Of the major attacks during this period, one can only remember the raid in the province of Salah ed-Din, which resulted in the death of five fighters.▪️Although everyone in the same CENTCOM points to a two-fold increase in the number of attacks by the Islamic State in the region, most of them occurred in neighboring Syria, where the MTO ambushes convoys of government troops in the desert areas of the provinces of Homs and Deir ez-Zor. In Iraq, at least, such a surge in activity has not yet been observed. At the same time, one of the threats for Iraq remains the transfer of militants from Syrian territory across the common border, some sections of which are protected very nominally. However, in general, the combat capabilities of the Islamic State in the country have been undermined, and the comparative improvement in the economic situation also further undermines the group’s food base.📌 Another point is also characteristic: in his speech, Al-Sudani said that it is not terrorist organizations that pose a much greater threat to Iraq today , but drugs, clearly meaning the cheap Syrian Captagon that flooded the streets. And it’s hard to disagree with this: given the momentum that the growing traffic of this drug to the countries of the region and beyond gives beneficiaries, it will be much more difficult for the Iraqi authorities to fight this phenomenon, rather than with attacks by prohibited groups.#Iraq #terrorism@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇮🇶🇷🇺🖇️ Yesterday we took part in a meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Muhammad Shia al-Sudani in Baghdad.

Kyiv has introduced emergency restrictions on the supply of electricity and is taking informational measures in order to exaggerate the damage received.▪️ That night, attacks on the enemy’s rear continued. Explosions were heard until the morning in Krivoy Rog, Zaporozhye, Chuguev, the city of Bershad in the Vinnytsia region, Starokonstantinov and Shepetivka in the Khmelnytsky region, Kyiv (Vyshgorod), Nikolaev, Cherkassy, ​​Sumy, Rivne, and Zhytomyr regions.

The question of a possible military operation in Transnistria by the Ukrainian Armed Forces has periodically arisen since 2022, and there is constant reconnaissance in the region by NATO. However, since the beginning of this year, the Moldovan authorities, led by Maia Sandu, have relied on economic blackmail for the forced reintegration of the PMR. ▪️The July opinion poll showed a clearly negative attitude of Moldovans towards solving the Transnistrian issue by military means. Sociologists also tried to find out the attitude of Moldovans to the capture of the PMR by Romanian troops or the Ukrainian Armed Forces. ▪️But even the wording of the questions is aimed at creating a negative attitude towards the PMR among Moldovans. For example, respondents were asked to answer questions about how acceptable it is for Chisinau to pay for gas consumed by Pridnestrovians. ▪️Hatred towards the PMR is multiplying on television. The other day, the head of the Moldovan National Party, Dragos Galbur, in an interview with TVC-21, said that he was ready to solve the problem of Transnistria and the Russian peacekeeping contingent in a few days by physically eliminating representatives of the Russian Armed Forces and all their sympathizers. Galbur is sure that the Armed Forces of Ukraine will help Moldova with this. The Moldovan authorities themselves are inciting hatred towards the PMR, but at the same time they are proposing to resolve the issue with someone else’s hands. ▪️Despite the negative attitude of Moldavian society towards the forceful takeover of the PMR, the Chisinau authorities continue militarization and military preparations on the border with the PMR.▪️In recent years, the Moldovan Armed Forces have been actively keeping records of reservists, the property of enterprises subject to possible mobilization, and are holding constant military training. ▪️Recently, the next military exercise - Fire Shield - 2024 - with the participation of military personnel from Romania and the United States ended in Moldova. ▪️According to the plan of the scriptwriters of a possible conflict, military -reintegration - for reasons of legality should be carried out by the Moldovan army. However, the operation, if prepared by the United States, could be carried out by the Romanian military in the uniform of the Moldovan Armed Forces. Moreover, there is already a trend towards merging the armies of both countries.▪️Obviously, in Chisinau, Bucharest and Western capitals they are still thinking about how to organize a military operation. Moreover, the latest rumors about preparations for the seizure of the PMR circulated last fall, when British Foreign Minister David Cameron, after his appointment, immediately went on a secret visit to Kyiv, the Odessa region bordering the PMR and Chisinau. One way or another, the locals intensified the discussion of this issue experts expect only after the presidential elections and referendum on European integration and EU membership, which will be held on October 20. #Moldova #NATO #Ukraine @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇲🇩🇷🇺🇺🇦 The situation around Transnistria as of 14.00 February 27, 2023🔻On the border of the Odessa region and the Transnistrian Moldavian Republic (PMR) the situation is still tense.

Moreover, the new shooting begins from the moment when the helicopter has already approached the UAV and only a few seconds remain before it is shot down. However, even during the day, a similar video was published from the outskirts of Kyiv, where attempts by the Ukrainian Mi-24 crew to hit a Russian drone were in vain. At the same time, the first video received much more distribution - after all, the Ukrainian media chose to post much more profitable footage for themselves. And although helicopter crews from both the Russian and Ukrainian sides are involved in this method of fighting drones, successfully hitting a target depends not only on skill and time of day, but also on simple luck - shooting down a UAV using on-board weapons is quite a difficult task, especially when We are talking about small-sized objects. Nevertheless, Ukrainian formations are actively using all the resources they have to combat raids by the Russian Armed Forces: from the usual air defense systems to mobile groups and the same helicopters. But gradually, drones themselves are beginning to be used as such means, which also pretend to occupy the niche of ersatz air defense. #UAV #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63083	2024-08-26T14:33:37-07:00
🔁🖼 Generation change: why does Israel need 50 new F-15s? The US...	Forwarded From Turned to the Z war 🇷🇺Generation change: why does Israel need 50 new F-15s? A couple of weeks ago, the US State Department approved the sale of more aircraft to Israel - this time, we are talking about 50 (!) new and promising F-15IA, that is modified version of the F-15EX Eagle II for local avionics and ammunition. Preliminarily, deliveries should begin in 2029. We can talk a lot about what wonderful aircraft these are, but the main reason for the deal is the total obsolescence of the Israeli F-15 fleet. The age of the very first aircraft (i.e. F-15A/B/C/D) is in the range of 30-50 years, and their modernization is simply pointless. Taking into account the annual flight time of 300-500 hours and a rich -past-, there are no modernization options. And these are two squadrons, that is, exactly 50 aircraft that need to be replaced. But it is quite possible to modify the F-15I, built in the late 90s. The second reason is that the F-35 does not meet the needs of the Israeli army. First of all, we are talking about the desire to have an aircraft with a flight range greater than that of the F-35 and capable of carrying ammunition like the GBU-28, which the F-35 is not able to use. In fact, the F-15EX is interesting for the Israelis in two guises - a heavy, long-range bomber capable of reaching Iranian nuclear facilities, and a missile platform, which in current realities turns into a very expensive, but very mobile air defense system. That is, this is either 13 tons of combat load, or 22 air-to-air missiles in -extreme- configurations. By and large, in the next 20-30 years, the appearance of the Israeli Air Force will be determined by the confrontation with Iran, and it will be very -asymmetrical- - technically , the Israelis are significantly superior to their enemy, but will be forced to act in extremely unfavorable conditions for themselves. Accordingly, the Air Force will remain two types of aircraft, as it was 50 years ago, only instead of -mirages- and -phantoms- a pair of F-35s and F-15s appears. Moreover, from the point of view of bombing a conditional Gaza or Lebanon, both of these aircraft are frankly redundant. Perhaps the main intrigue here is different: will it be necessary to postpone plans to switch to the F-35 in order to exercise the option for an additional 25 F-15s and how the deal will affect the planned purchase attack helicopters AH-64E, which suddenly became relevant after the events of October 7, when two units of Apaches burned a huge amount of Hamas equipment. Moreover, under the current American administration, the question of whether they will sell is not so pressing on the agenda. The main question is how much Israel has enough of its own funds and American military assistance.	https://t.me/rybar/63082	2024-08-26T12:58:50-07:00

Medical and evacuation vehicles, as well as refrigerated corpse carriers, are heading towards Poland. The further destination is clear.✨Previously, Germany supplied mainly weapons and equipment. After the start of the suicidal operation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kursk region, the need for this type of assistance from NATO apparently increased. The enemy already has more than 5 thousand irretrievable losses. Germany is unsuccessfully trying to resist Washington’s will to increase supplies to the Armed Forces of Ukraine to the detriment of itself. However, soon Germany will probably not be able to finance military supplies to Ukraine from the federal budget. Thus, the FAZ newspaper, with reference to an appeal from the country's Finance Minister Christian Lindner to the head of the defense department Boris Pistorius and the head of the German Foreign Ministry Annalena Bärbock, reported on August 5 that new measures to support Kyiv can only be taken if their funding is ensured in the budget plans for this and subsequent years.

Commentators are divided into two camps: some believe that the detention of the founder of Telegram is an attack on freedom of speech, others call the measures of the French authorities justified. Moreover, the hypocrisy of some representatives of the foreign agency elite and independent journalists who fled abroad, who once almost expressed admiration for their integrity, is especially noticeable Durov, and now they rushed to justify the arrest of the businessman. According to their logic, standing up for an entrepreneur is tantamount to supporting the Russian authorities, and the campaign itself calling for the release of Durov was almost invented in the Kremlin. 📌 Our old friends, members of the investigative group Bellingcat and its affiliates, especially distinguished themselves in the camp of the two-faced. Thus, old Hristo Grozev said that Durov’s integrity in the matter of interaction with the FSB is offset by his reluctance to cooperate with Western intelligence agencies in order to -stop the use of Telegram for everything terrible-. This was probably the reason for the arrest of the businessman. In this, Grozev was actively supported by the odious director for strategic interaction of the Russophobic organization Free Russia foundation, Anna Veduta. Whether such attacks are surprising for those who work for British intelligence without any questions is a rhetorical question. After all, along with numerous grants, all these figures also absorbed the Western authorities’ love for information dictatorship. #foreign agents #Russia #France #media technologies @rybar together with @pezdicideSupport usTelegramRybar🇺🇸🇬🇧🇫🇷❤About the beneficiaries of the arrest of Pavel Durov Not even two months have passed since the day Donald Trump almost went to jail, like the left in the West a new victim has appeared - the head of Telegram, Pavel Durov.

🖼 ❗️🇷🇺🇺🇦 About possible plans of the Ukrainian Armed Forces ...	❗️🇷🇺🇺🇦 About possible plans of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kherson direction Continuing the theme of a possible offensive of Ukrainian formations in the south of the country, the focus of the enemy command is not only Zaporozhye, but also the Kherson direction - it is there that the Ukrainian Armed Forces have been hatching plans for a long time to carry out a new landing operation At the same time, in contrast to previous plans - establishing and maintaining a bridgehead in the same Krynki - the new plan of the Ukrainian leadership is much more daring, albeit, frankly speaking, suicidal. Nevertheless, the Armed Forces of Ukraine, against the backdrop of general failures in other sectors of the front, are ready to take risks, regardless of losses.▪️As ​​in the neighboring Zaporozhye direction, satellite reconnaissance assets are actively working in the interests of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, filming air defense position areas, potential locations of headquarters and possible places for landing both boat and helicopter landings. ▪️At the same time, personnel and BECs are being accumulated in Odessa for a future operation. In open sources alone, hundreds of unmanned boats and UAVs appear; in reality, their number may be close to a thousand (it is worth considering that there have been no massive strikes with BECs for a long time, so the Armed Forces of Ukraine were certainly able to accumulate them).▪️The enemy is considering the possibility of a combined attack with drones and BECs to the Crimea, as well as for objects on the Tendrovskaya and Kinburn spits. Judging by the plan, they will be followed by a boat landing in several places with a subsequent attempt to expand the zone of control.▪️Another stage of the plan involves the landing of several DRGs in the area of ​​large settlements in the south of the region with the aim of attacks on headquarters for the general disorganization of control. One of such sections could be the line Iron Port - Lazurnoe - Skadovsk (if you evaluate the security of the coastline as a whole, then this option certainly cannot be excluded).▪️As ​​for the island zone of the Dnieper, a repetition of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ operations following the example of Krynoki and Cossack Camps is unlikely - According to incoming information, Russian military personnel confidently hold a significant part of the islands, while the Ukrainian command is preparing precisely for an offensive on the spits. 🔻At the same time, probable losses of the management of the so-called. Ukraine is not particularly worried. Moreover, even a few hundred members of the Ukrainian formations will be enough to create a rustle until the moment of blocking. And taking into account the problems of the local group of the Russian Armed Forces and in the event of a combination of the operation with the start of an offensive in the Zaporozhye region, the situation may take on a much more threatening character . This is exactly what the Ukrainian command is betting on. At the same time, the fact that certain enemy plans are being gossiped about in almost every smoking room in the south of Russia, the deliberate injection of information about preparations for an offensive cannot be ruled out. Everyone is put on alert, the danger mode is on high for a certain number of days, but in the end nothing will happen. But when everyone relaxes, it will be possible to bring the idea into reality.

🔁🖼 3rd Carrier Strike Group of the US Navy, consisting of AVMA ...	Forwarded From Cats and Kramnik's cat The 3rd carrier strike group of the US Navy, consisting of AVMA -Abraham Lincoln- with the 9th carrier-based aviation wing on board, the missile cruiser -Mobile Bay- and destroyers from the 21st squadron, arrived in the Middle East , becoming the second AUG in the region. Since June, the 9th AUG, led by Theodore Roosevelt, the 11th Carrier Air Wing aboard an aircraft carrier, and the destroyers of the 23rd Squadron have been deployed there. The cruiser was not given, it is possible that due to the technical condition of the latter. This is the preamble. Ambula: the States in the area of ​​responsibility of the 5th Fleet (Middle East, North-West Indian Ocean) have two AUGs with attached forces (including a carrier boat of the Ohio-type CD), and in the area of ​​​​responsibility of the 7th - where The Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean from the mouth of the Indus to the east along the International Date Line and from the Bering Strait to the Antarctic - there are no aircraft carriers. Despite the fact that it is the zone of the 7th Fleet that is considered the main one in the confrontation with the PRC, and for the last fifteen years the fleet has been solving the problem of keeping the majority of its forces there. The role of the AUG is performed by two amphibious groups deployed in the region with universal landing ships. No, soon an aircraft carrier will appear there - George Washington, at the head of his AUG, will go to Yokosuka as a stationary, but he will be there alone for quite a long time, because priorities are priorities, and the situation dictates. And this is not about the fact that -they can’t fight there anyway - but about the fact that supremacy at sea, which must be confirmed by physical presence, is challenged by China on a daily basis - with its fishing, countering foreign forces, escorting foreign warships in disputed waters and other physical pressure designed to confirm the thesis - these are our seas - and to instill it in those around us - including in subsequent political planning. In fact, the confrontation of fleets in such situations is an increase in the scale of history - infantry - criminal groups, challenging each other's markets, parking lots and other interesting places - controlling their objects and not allowing strangers there. And in this confrontation in the western Pacific Ocean and in the southern seas, China now has the largest grouping, to counter which the United States is forced to resort to the help of its allies: the Italians, for example, sent their AUG led by -Cavour- to the region. But after the States themselves told everyone for a long time about one hundred thousand tons of diplomacy with 80 planes and helicopters on board, an aircraft carrier of 27 thousand tons with two dozen aircraft no longer causes that awe. And joint Russian-Chinese exercises in the Pacific Ocean clearly influence the balance more than the presence of detachments of ships of European fleets. F-35 flights from Cavour on this trip are shown in the photo.	https://t.me/rybar/63078	2024-08-26T09:17:19-07:00

A similar situation is developing in the Viktorovka region. In addition, information is being received about the presence of the enemy in Byakhovo and Vnezapnoye, but so far there is no confirmation of this. ▪️In the area of ​​Korenevo itself and in the neighboring Olgovka-Kremyanoye area there are battles, the enemy is trying to advance in small groups. According to incoming information, some time ago Ukrainian formations established control over Matveevka. At the same time, the situation in the Zhuravli area and to the north remains unclear; at least enemy DRGs were previously seen there, and there were no reports of a cleanup. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, Ukrainian formations also tried to attack in the area of ​​Malaya Loknya and Pogrebkov, but without much success. At the same time, in the area of ​​Novaya Sorochina and Kruglenky, according to the Ministry of Defense, positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces were struck. ▪️Another attack was thwarted in the Nechaev area of ​​the Bolshesoldatsky district, where the enemy maintains a presence southwest of the village and has gained a foothold in the nearby forest. In addition, information appeared in the media about the liberation of the village of Nizhnyaya Parovaya, but no one had previously reported about the capture of the village by the enemy. In addition, based on objective control footage, another enemy armored group was subjected to several attacks east of Malaya Loknya. ▪️In addition, information about Cherkasy Porechny, in the area of ​​which several attacks were previously repelled, has become somewhat clearer.

Ukraine on August 26 - what is known by 17:00 The Internet continues to actively discuss the massive strike of Russian troops on enemy targets in the so-called territory. Ukraine. And although a significant part of the targets remains unknown, against the backdrop of the images that have appeared, some results of the raid can already be summed up. ▪️In Kyiv, industrial institutions specializing in the production and modernization of aviation ammunition were hit, among them the Research Institute of Aviation Technology, which is part of the so-called military-industrial complex. Ukraine. There are also reports of a series of explosions in the area of ​​Zhulyany airport. In Vyshgorod, a northern suburb of the Ukrainian capital, one of the missiles hit a turbine room on the dam of the Kyiv reservoir. A fire broke out on the premises. However, it is still difficult to determine the extent of damage based on the available footage. At the same time, the Ukrainian authorities have already stated that the dam has not received significant damage, and traffic along it will be restored in the coming hours. ▪️In the Odessa region, Russian troops attacked a warehouse south of the village of Usatovo and an electrical substation of the same name. After the arrivals, a wave of emergency power outages occurred throughout Odessa. ▪️In the west the so-called. In Ukraine, one of the hits was on the Khmelnitsky 330 substation, which resulted in an emergency power outage in at least part of the Khmelnitsky region. In the administrative center, power outages led to a stop in the movement of trolleybuses.▪️In the Sumy region, the railway infrastructure, which is actively used by Ukrainian formations, including for the transfer of additional forces to the Russian border, was hit. ▪️In the Dnepropetrovsk region, the energy infrastructure was attacked. Information is also being received about a hit on the territory of the Dnepropetrovsk International Airport. ▪️Not far from Vinnitsa, according to monitoring resources, a fire was recorded on the territory of the Vinnitsa 750 PS. Another hit was on the Bar 330 PS.▪️Critical infrastructure facilities were hit in the Zhytomyr, Nikolaev, Poltava and Lviv regions. There is also unconfirmed information about a hit on the Trikhaty 330 substation in the Nikolaev region and the Pervomaiskaya 330 substation in the Dnepropetrovsk region.▪️According to the Ukrainian authorities and media, power outages occurred throughout Ukraine. At the same time, problems with water supply are recorded in seven regions: Dnepropetrovsk, Kyiv, Vinnitsa, Zhytomyr, Rivne, Volyn and Lviv regions.❗️At the same time, we note that it is beneficial for the enemy to exaggerate the degree of problems so that damaged or surviving objects are among the targets planned for today added to the list of destroyed. This can also be carried out with the aim of obtaining supplies of much-needed air defense systems. 🔻The new massive strike by the Russian Armed Forces also reminded us of long-rooted formulations - each such raid is presented as part of some kind of -act of retaliation- for any enemy aggression. So, not only a significant part of the patriotic channels, but also quite official speakers connected the new attack with revenge for the Kursk region. Against this background, let us ask a question that has already set the teeth on edge: Do we expect certain actions from the Ukrainian formations in order to justify strikes on enemy targets? Be that as it may, only the systematic destruction of targets can cause significant damage - this is what is worth continuing to do, instead of playing by someone else’s rules and looking for excuses for another massive raid.

One of them was almost a year-long filming from the Havana Bridge in Kyiv, which demonstrates several hits on objects in the Ukrainian capital, including the Artem plant. In the Russian segment, many took this video at face value and -swallowed the bait- - it was actively disseminated as confirmation of the effectiveness of the raid, although it had nothing in common with it.

According to him, this is how it will be possible to break the prevailing stereotypes in the press about the state of affairs in Iraq and create a positive image of the country in the world. At the same time, the very fact that the head of state invites representatives of the Russian information and analytical media network to a meeting speaks of a certain understanding by Iraqi authorities on the role of Telegram in the modern information war.

According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, a total of 22 drones were intercepted over eight regions. ▪️This time the main blow fell on the Saratov region, where the Volga Sky residential complex on Predmostovaya Square in Saratov and a multi-storey building in the center of Engels came under attack. Four civilians were injured, one woman was hospitalized in serious condition. The most likely target of the enemy was the Engels strategic aviation airfield - it itself had already been repeatedly attacked by Ukrainian Armed Forces drones, which flew at a low enough altitude to minimize the possibility of detection. ▪️Another enemy drone was intercepted on approach to Yaroslavl. According to some reports, Ukrainian formations tried to strike a local oil refinery. There was no destruction or casualties at the site where the debris fell.▪️In the Belgorod region, on the Krasnaya Yaruga-Vyazovoe highway section, two FPV drones of the Ukrainian Armed Forces attacked a passenger car: two civilians were injured and were hospitalized. ▪️Air defense systems also worked in the Kursk, Bryansk, Tula, Oryol and Ryazan regions. There, according to preliminary information, there were no injuries or injuries. 🔻Recently, Ukrainian formations have been steadily choosing either fuel and energy complex facilities or military airfields as the main targets of drone attacks. At the same time, the raids themselves are carried out almost one after another, which once again indicates the high volume of drone production by the enemy and his intention to tirelessly launch UAVs.

In Russian telegram channels they did not fail to notice a very obvious fact: equipping even a hundred pickup trucks with similar means would be significantly cheaper than losing another oil depot, like the one that has been burning for more than a week near Proletarsk. The possibility of creating such an ersatz air defense has been discussed almost since the first attacks of Ukrainian drones on targets in Russia, but without practical results. Somewhere, for example, in Crimea, there are such mobile groups, and they are quite effective in countering drones. In addition, even if we don’t have to talk about the complete destruction of the enemy’s production facilities, I would like to note the following: if massive strikes were a regular practice, and not one-time actions -retribution-, the Ukrainian Armed Forces would have many times fewer opportunities for strikes.#Russia #Ukraine @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63061	2024-08-26T03:00:36-07:00
🇬🇧On the British government's reaction to the riots At the end ...	🇬🇧On the British government's response to the riots At the end of July, after a 17-year-old teenager attacked children with a knife in Southport, large-scale protests broke out in many UK cities, which escalated into riots and clashes with the police. To suppress the protests, the British government deployed 6,000 specialist police officers. Relative calm was achieved only after harsh exemplary sentences and the launch of an information campaign to intimidate the rioters. As a result, since July 29, more than 1,000 arrests have been made and&nbsp; over 600 charges. Over 300 people are currently in custody, and this figure is not final. Of course, the penitentiary system, which has accumulated many problems, could not -digest- such an influx of criminals, so the government had to look for additional places in prisons by early releasing some prisoners. 📌The release of criminals from prison is a strong element of pressure on the population and allows the country's citizens to be distracted from the flaws of the authorities' policies. Well, such measures pursue a number of unobvious goals. Firstly, staying in prison will protect right-wing activists from physical harm that could overtake them on the street. Secondly, being in prison will allow them to get to know each other and consolidate.🔻Thus, a significant number of supporters of anti-migrant protests will be intimidated by imprisonment, and the most proactive activists will become more united, which will allow them to be used in their own interests.

The targets of the raid included energy infrastructure facilities and air defense position areas.▪️A series of explosions occurred in more than ten regions, including Kharkov, Vinnitsa, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kyiv and Dnepropetrovsk regions. ▪️A wide range of attack means is used for fire destruction: from kamikaze drones of the Geranium family to cruise and ballistic missiles. ▪️According to preliminary information, an industrial facility in the Poltava region, substations in Rivne and Odessa, and energy infrastructure in Lutsk were also affected. ▪️Against the background of the raid, Ukrenergo ordered emergency power outages throughout Ukraine: local residents reported a lack of power in Lviv, Khmelnitsky, Zhytomyr, Odessa and many other cities. ▪️There were also problems with water supply, including in four districts of the Ukrainian capital: Shevchenkovsky, Svyatoshinsky, Solomensky and Goloseevsky. At the same time, it is reported that it hit the territory of the Kyiv Zhulyany airport and an as yet unidentified energy system facility. ▪️There were also power outages on the railway infrastructure, and backup diesel locomotives were introduced.🔻Nevertheless, the emergency power outages introduced by the Ukrainian authorities are, first of all, precautionary measures. At the same time, the enemy may try to confuse Russian troops about the supposedly large-scale consequences of the raid in order to convince them of the defeat of all targets. Therefore, at the moment, the damage caused has yet to be confirmed. In addition, such massive strikes must be systematic: long-term disruption of the energy infrastructure will significantly complicate logistics, as well as the repair of equipment and the work of the enemy’s industry. #digest #Russia #Ukraine #electricity @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63055	2024-08-26T00:45:56-07:00

Russian troops launched guided missile attacks on Zmeiny Island and drilling platforms in the Black Sea. In addition, enemy targets were hit in temporarily occupied Slavyansk and Kramatorsk: in the latter, a strike was made on the temporary deployment point of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in a hotel where foreign journalists were also accommodated. Ukrainian formations launched a combined attack on the Voronezh region, damaging an ammunition depot in the Ostrogozhsky district. In Sevastopol, debris from an undetonated drone washed up on one of the piers. In the North Ukrainian direction, Russian troops recaptured previously lost positions in the Kremyanoy and Olgovka areas in the Korenevsky district. The Ukrainian Armed Forces carried out an attack in the direction of Cherkasskaya Konopelka in the Sudzhansky district. In the Aleksandro-Kalinovsky direction, Russian troops are consolidating on the approaches to microdistrict No. 1 in Dzerzhinsk and completing the encirclement of the remnants of the Ukrainian Armed Forces garrison in Kirovo. In the Pokrovsky direction, the Russian Armed Forces are breaking through the enemy’s defenses, simultaneously advancing to the west within the borders of Novogrodovka and south through Kalinovo in the direction of the M-30 highway. In the Yuzhnodonetsk direction, Russian troops have entrenched themselves on the southern outskirts of Konstantinovka on the territory of a local agricultural complex. To the south, a large stronghold at the intersection of the T-05-24 highway with the road to Vodyanoye came under control.

The US Navy destroyer Ralph Johnson crossed the Taiwan Strait. To understand why the Chinese express their dissatisfaction every time, you need to remember the status of Taiwan. The Chinese consider it theirs and want to take it back. The Americans obviously support independence, so for them the Taiwan Strait is international waters through which they supposedly have the right to move. Such actions by the US Navy occur with enviable regularity, on average twice a year. And every time everything follows the same scenario: the destroyer goes through the strait, and the PLA reaction is monitored by the RC-135. This time, the Chinese side sent J-16 fighters to protect the airspace, and its own aircraft to track the ship and the reconnaissance aircraft long-range radar detection KJ-500. Although this increases the degree of tension between countries, this is all commonplace. Therefore, when you see news marked lightning that the Americans are provoking China, you can safely ignore it.

Russian troops are pushing through the defenses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces both in Novogrodovka itself and from the flanks, trying to take the city into a semi-ring. Ukrainian formations, deprived of their usual advantage in the form of well-fortified defensive lines, are gradually retreating on several sectors of the front at once. ▪️Advanced units of the Russian Armed Forces advanced at the Krutoy Yar - Krasny Yar line, gaining a foothold on the southeastern outskirts of the latter. Russian troops are actively using artillery and UAVs to suppress Ukrainian Armed Forces firing points, which allows attack aircraft to clear enemy positions without significant problems. Some sources are already reporting about the control of the Russian Armed Forces over both settlements, but it has not yet been possible to confirm this information with objective control personnel. ❗️The liberation of Krutoy and Krasny Yarov will allow the Russian Armed Forces to begin storming the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the waste heap of the Novogrodovskaya-No. 3 mine. This height serves as the key to forming the northern front of the half-environment of Novogrodovka and the enemy units located in the city. ▪️In Novogrodovka itself, Russian attack aircraft are rapidly overcoming the enemy’s defensive lines. We can speak with confidence about the control of the Russian Armed Forces over Michurin and Turgenev streets, as well as about the beginning of battles for Molodezhnaya Street. According to some reports, advanced Russian assault groups have already reached the central part of the city and started fighting there. Information is being circulated on the Internet about Russian troops occupying enemy positions in the area of ​​the crossing on the western outskirts of the city and separate rifle battles to the north, in the area of ​​the substation on Nekrasov Street. Probably, we are talking about Russian DRGs disrupting supplies and attacking key defense centers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and not about linear units capable of gaining a foothold in the sector. Despite the spreading panic in the enemy’s information space, it is premature to talk about control of the Russian Armed Forces over the city. Most reports of Russian units entering certain areas of a populated area come from disoriented local residents who do not have proper information about the situation in the city. ▪️To the south, Russian troops are fighting on the approaches to the Kotlyarevskaya mine, the capture of which will simplify the offensive on this section of the front. The advanced assault troops advanced close to the Mikhailovka railway station and physically cut off the M-30 highway, along which enemy units were supplied on the northern flank of the Donetsk direction.▪️At the Karlovka-Memrik line, Russian troops significantly expanded the zone of control, developing an offensive from Ptichye to Kalinovo, and also significantly advanced north along the Karlovskoye Reservoir after the capture of Skuchny. ❗️According to some information, Russian troops are actively attacking from the flanks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ defensive lines in the Kalinovo area, trying to bypass and isolate enemy strongholds. He, in turn, is making attempts to prevent the Russian Armed Forces from breaking through to the M-30 highway and their advance on Galitsynovka.

In the Kursk region, Russian troops continue to hold back the enemy’s onslaught, inflicting significant losses on Ukrainian formations along the entire length of the contact line.🔻In In the Korenevsky district, the Russian Armed Forces regained control over Olgovka, the battle for which took place several days ago. Apparently, after losing a large number of armored vehicles and manpower in the village and district, the Ukrainian Armed Forces were forced to retreat. On the approaches to Korenevo and Zeleny Shlyakh, two BMP-1 BMP-1s were hit by FPV drones. The Armed Forces of Ukraine do not give up attempts to enter directly into Korenevo itself, but all their attacks are successfully repulsed.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, fighting is still going on in the Malaya Lokni area. All attempts by the enemy to enter and gain a foothold in the village were stopped; it is under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. In the area of ​​Martynovka and Russky Porechny, clashes continue. In the area, there is an increase in the intensity of artillery shelling on Russian positions, which is associated with the transfer of additional guns by Ukrainian formations from other sectors of the front.🔻Russian troops continue systematic work to destroy air defense systems and radar stations in the Sumy region . UAV operators hit the Lancet ST-68 radar of the Ukrainian Armed Forces with a kamikaze drone near Shevchenkovo ​​in the Sumy region.

All this has already become so familiar that it is not surprising. And the last few days have been no exception. The other day, a pair of American B-2A bombers, the flight of which we talked about a few days ago, flew to the Bay of Bengal in transit through the Diego Garcia airbase on the Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean. Nothing supernatural happened. On such business trips, bomber flights are a standard procedure to demonstrate the strength and power of the United States and do not serve any other purpose.❗️However, the flight area surprisingly (not) coincided with the Falcon Strike exercise of Chinese and Thai military personnel currently taking place in Thailand. Considering that Thailand is also part of the confrontation zone between the two powers, the provocative flight of the B-2A may be closely related to this. The Chinese are using Jian-10 fighters and Jianhong-7A fighter-bombers, and the Thais are using AlphaJet attack aircraft . The main point is the joint use of aviation in the event of a crisis situation in the region.▪️In addition, in India, the multinational Tarang Shakti exercise is currently ongoing in the state of Tamil Nadu. Remember, this is an event in which the French, Germans and Spaniards participate as part of a round-the-world flight of their military aircraft. There was no official talk about the participation of the Americans, but to support their NATO allies, as well as to show their -good- intentions to the Celestial Empire (which consists of tensions with India) - why not?High resolution mapEnglish version#Australia #China #USA #Thailand@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63043	2024-08-25T07:04:53-07:00

The capabilities of the radar will allow the Alliance to cover a wide range of tasks both in identifying surface targets and air targets . And there is no need to explain who all this will be aimed at. And these are by no means pacifist tasks. With the advent of F-16 fighters, this radar will significantly simplify the work of Ukrainian formations in targeting the now important Crimea and Kherson region. An interesting situation arises. There are more and more military equipment off the Russian coast. After all, this station is just the tip of the iceberg. There are also dozens of drones and planes, not to mention satellites.

Rybar: 🇮🇶 By the will of fate, part of our team ended up in the Middle East again, this time in Iraq, where Rybar’s very first post was written six years ago. A lot has changed here since our last visit, and for the better. So, Baghdad... 🇮🇶🇷🇺 During our visit to Iraq, we were able to meet with Ayad Alavi, the country’s first prime minister after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein’s regime in 2003. We talked with him on various topics - from the events of the American occupation and efforts to restore the country to what is happening in the Northern Military District zone. During a very pleasant conversation, the topic of the Russian presence in Iraq was also raised. The politician’s opinion on this matter was unequivocal: although there are points of contact and good relations, the volume of interaction between states is modest, and firms from Russia show much less interest in the country than even small countries in distant Europe. Alas, so far it’s mostly just a matter of making hands. In many countries of the Middle East and the global south in general, Russian companies are indeed expected at least as an alternative to American, British and Chinese corporations. But even in hydrocarbon-rich and - unlike many - solvent Iraq, the great potential for cooperation has been realized at a meager percentage. Of course, I would like to believe that some of the processes currently taking place will change the situation. However, here it is most appropriate to remember the saying - Strike while the iron is hot - especially in light of the fact that foreign policy realities can be changeable.#Iraq #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63041	2024-08-25T04:42:47-07:00

🇺🇸🇬🇧🇫🇷❤About the beneficiaries of the arrest of Pavel Durov...	🇺🇸🇬🇧🇫🇷❤About the beneficiaries of the arrest of Pavel Durov Less than two months have passed since the day Donald Trump almost went to jail, when the left in the West had a new victim - the head of Telegram, Pavel Durov. Telegram has long become a bone in the throat American and European governments and intelligence services - in the United States and the European Union, the platform took the shape of an emerging stronghold - freedom of speech - under the conditions of the most severe and total control by X (formerly Twitter), recognized as extremist in the Russian Federation by Meta and Google. In the United States, cleared after the events of 6 January 2021, the right-wing movement almost completely moved to Telegram and from there broadcast to an audience of thousands. Coordination between activists continued, the truth about the rigged 2020 elections by Joe Biden’s team was spreading to the people - the Democrats could not allow this.📌The operation to suppress Telegram, apparently, was agreed upon and planned in advance, since a few days before Durov’s arrest major American conservative channels faced bans in mobile applications and blocking of personal accounts of owners. In connection with, most likely, a temporary problem with the lack of keys to the messenger, the following scheme was used: troll farms (mainly consisting of volunteers from various left-liberal organizations that flooded Twitter) were hired en masse, through which they attacked one or another channel/account reports. There are also big questions about what guided the moderators who satisfied such suspicious and massive complaints. It is noteworthy that this happened not only in the USA: inconvenient channels are also eliminated in the UK in a similar way. Ultimately, the situation with Durov only confirms the fact that no matter how influential a person is, it will not be possible to remain a third party in a big game. Despite all their financial power, neither Elon Musk nor Mark Zuckerberg could escape cooperation with the American government. Even the billionaire who challenged the swamp and, for a moment, the 45th American president, Donald Trump, was seriously injured. The two chairs seen at Durov’s interview with Tucker Carlson perfectly personified the essence and rules of survival in big politics. Where Paul, who realized this, made a mistake is not yet clear. What is known is that third parties usually end up the way Julian Assange did. #globalism #UK #USA #France@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport usTelegramAmerican number🇺🇸🙍‍♂ Yesterday Donald Trump celebrated his next legal success - the US Supreme Court ruled that a politician, as a former president, has partial immunity from legal prosecution, which applies to his actions within the scope of his official duties...	https://t.me/rybar/63039	2024-08-25T02:13:21-07:00

Forwarded From Two Majors #Review #Summary for August 25, 2024▪️ The third week of repelling the armed invasion of the Ukrainian Armed Forces into the territory of the Kursk region of the Russian Federation is ending. The enemy is constrained by the fighting and is suffering significant losses in men and equipment, but is trying to move forward, although the previous breakthroughs of its combat reconnaissance patrols have been localized. Heavy, high-intensity battles are taking place simultaneously in a number of settlements in the region; the Russian Armed Forces have brought up reserves, incl. 11th Brigade After the destruction of bridges in the Glushkovsky region, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are launching attacks from MLRS -HIMARS- on our river crossings, limiting the possibility of removing civilians and complicating military logistics. The heads of Lgov and Korenevsky district recommended that residents not return until the situation stabilizes; the expediency of this is confirmed by the shelling of Lgov.▪️ The enemy retains offensive potential in other directions. Thus, information is received about the enemy’s plans to attack the Bryansk region, the accumulation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kamensk direction of the Zaporozhye Front and the preparation of an amphibious operation on the spits in the Kherson region. Apparently, the Russian Armed Forces are managing to disrupt the plans of the Ukrainian Armed Forces by launching missile strikes against the concentration of enemy forces. However, the enemy’s attack on the ferry in the port of Caucasus cannot be called harmless either▪️ Military airfields and oil depots remain the targets of enemy UAV strikes. At the same time, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are testing new UAVs with jet engines. The channels of our military aircraft express surprise at the inadequacy of measures taken to protect airfields, namely the small number of mobile air defense groups, which, like the enemy, could neutralize threats from enemy drones while still flying to the infrastructure of aviation units.▪️ The Russian Army is achieving serious success at Pokrovsky direction, expanding the huge ledge near Pokrovsk, which is about 10 km away. The enemy puts up fierce resistance, but is unable to stabilize the front and loses several settlements at a time. ▪️ In the Toretsk (Dzerzhinsk) agglomeration, the Russian Armed Forces are wedging deeper and deeper into the enemy’s defenses, the liberation of New York (Novgorod) has become symbolic. The fortified area as a whole has been built by the enemy since 2014; the advance in this direction of the Russian Army is hampered by defensive structures and terrain features. The Ukrainian Armed Forces, in response to the successes of our troops, are hitting the civilian population of Donetsk and Gorlovka.✨ Thus, the enemy in his actions is guided more by political than military expediency. The invasion of the Kursk region, terrorist attacks on civilians and impending enemy attacks are aimed at demonstrating to the West the readiness of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to sacrifice personnel in order to receive military-technical assistance from NATO, occupy strategically important energy facilities and control trade routes (in the south, the spits of the Kherson region are needed for shipping from ports of Nikolaev), destabilization of the internal political situation in Russia. At the same time, in the Kursk direction, the Armed Forces of Ukraine continue to use the effect of our own sloppiness, which is urgently corrected manually from the highest level.

The good news is that we have such developments, and they are not just a military messenger, but a full-fledged decision support system (DSS) with many other functions. They are also not dealt with by the Kulibins, but by real proactive professionals in their field, of whom the Ministry of Defense is aware. The bad news is that on the part of the Main Directorate of Civil Defense there has been no real interest in the targeted and centralized introduction of them into the troops for two and a half years. There is nothing to say about the same ESU TZ, on which astronomical sums have been spent over decades. It will be very sad and at the same time funny if the arrest of Pavel Durov becomes the catalyst for changes in approaches to communications and control in the RF Armed Forces.

Details about the reasons for the incident vary from publication to publication. However, one thing is clear: the true goal is the desire to obtain certain tools to which the authorities in France (and not only) have not had access until now. Regardless of further developments, the news will clearly become the main global topic this weekend and will subsequently affect both the work of the Telegram team, and the global media sphere in general. #mediatechnology #France@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63027	2024-08-24T14:02:23-07:00

Today alone, in the south of the enclave, at least 15 houses were blown up in the Western Market area of ​​Rafah, and in Khan Yunis, one of the largest mosques in the city, El-Kabir or the Great Mosque, was destroyed. According to the press service of the Israel Defense Forces, under the territory of the religious site, Hamas militants built a tunnel, which contained not only ammunition and weapons, but also launchers and missiles for them. In the same video materials that appeared on the Internet, filmed on a GoPro camera on the helmet of one of the Israeli servicemen, the destruction of the found copies of the Koran in the Bani Saleh mosque is recorded. 📌The Israelis have demonstrated a similar attitude towards cultural objects in the Gaza Strip since the beginning of the conflict. The issues of preserving the historical heritage of the Palestinians are not at all included in the plans of the IDF command. What does it cost to destroy the so-called. Al-Basha Palace is a building dating back to the Mamluk dynasty in the 13th century. As for the burning of the Koran, the IDF press service pointedly condemned this behavior of Israeli military personnel and announced an investigation. But as practice shows (and such a case is far from isolated), this will not particularly affect the emergence of new personnel with the destruction of the Holy Scriptures. #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63026	2024-08-24T11:32:45-07:00

In the Kursk region, Ukrainian troops are making attempts to improve the tactical situation in several areas.🔻In the Korenevsky district, several enemy attacks were repelled in the direction of Komarovka and Kremyany. In the latest move, the Russian Armed Forces also expanded the zone of control in the village to the west: footage appeared of a shell being dropped from a Ukrainian Armed Forces drone on the position of Russian troops.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, the enemy does not stop trying to break through the defenses in the Malaya Lokni area, and has currently been repelled. Operational-tactical aviation and artillery crews worked on the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the approaches to the village. In Cherkasy Porechny, the enemy made an unsuccessful attack attempt. Having been ambushed on the road, an Ukrainian Armed Forces tank hit a mine and was subsequently finished off by an FPV drone, completely burning out. Clashes continue within the populated area. The situation in the area of ​​Russkaya and Cherkasskaya Konopelek has become clearer. The enemy is attacking towards the latter: thus, the moment a drone hit a group of Ukrainian infantry in one of the buildings on the territory of the Lotos gas station was captured. There are fierce clashes in the area, information about the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces over the settlements of Kolmakov and Dmitryukov is currently not confirmed.

Since our last visit, a lot has changed here, and for the better. Thus, Baghdad and Karbala are actively being built up with residential and commercial buildings, new cars are driving along the avenues, and the streets in Sunni areas, where previously al-Qaeda carried out terrorist attacks every day, they are acquiring good restaurants. There are also problems, but against the backdrop of Lebanon without electricity or the total devastation in Syria, Iraq looks incomparably more prosperous. And the security here is in order, a sign of which is at least the checkpoints that previously stood at every step that have disappeared from the cities. And in the photo one is the territory of the US Embassy - a huge complex in the Green Zone, which in fact is a full-fledged military base guarded from all sides right in the center of Baghdad.

Thus, the commander of the Ugandan armed forces, who has already proven himself in an openly anti-Western position, as well as the likely successor to the current president Muhoozi Kainerugaba, met with the military delegation From Russia. At the meeting, which took place at the headquarters of the special forces, issues of strategic importance were discussed, mainly related to aviation. The latter is not surprising, because the Russian side was represented by Major General Sergei Marchuk, head of the test center of the Russian Aerospace Forces. In addition, Uganda recently became the first African country to modernize helicopters from Russia. Russia’s active cooperation with new countries (outside the Sahel and the Central African Republic), which are ready to openly declare their position and oppose the West, cannot but rejoice. The main thing is that this cooperation does not stall on issues of the military-technical sphere, but gradually moves into the economic and political plane.#Africa #Russia #Uganda@rybarSupport usUG BulletinUganda deepens military ties with Russia as Gen Muhoozi hosts high-level delegationGen Muhoozi Kainerugaba, Uganda's Chief of Defense Forces (CDF) has welcomed a prominent Russian military delegation to the Special Forces	https://t.me/rybar/63022	2024-08-24T08:12:23-07:00

According to the Syrian Ministry of Defense, the missile launches were carried out from the airspace over the northern part of Lebanon. At the same time, the Syrian Armed Forces managed to intercept some of the Israeli ammunition.▪️In the vicinity of the city of Homs, Israeli fighters attacked Syrian air defense crews in the settlements of Umm Haratein and Ad-Douri. Two people were injured. In addition, several residential buildings were damaged.▪️In the rural area of ​​Hama, the weapons depots of the 47th SAA armored brigade in the vicinity of the city of Khattab were under fire. At least five Syrian citizens were injured. Israeli media, citing opposition Syrian resources, also write about arrivals at the Scientific Research Center in the village of Maarin al-Jabal. The facility is used for the development of missile weapons. Monitoring sites reported the possibility of another attack on the SAR. Thus, in the Mediterranean Sea region, as well as over the Palestinian Authority, the activity of Israeli reconnaissance aircraft and the MQ-4C Triton UAV of the US Armed Forces was recorded. There are no specifics about how serious the hits were. But the methodical work to suppress Syrian air defense continues over and over again. There is no point in talking about the goals of this tactic again. Just look at how comfortable Israeli aviation feels in the region.

On the set of six of our soldiers, who since August 6, starting with the invasion of the Ukrainian fascists in the Kursk region, have been on one of the sections of the border.⠀Four of them are servicemen of the AKHMAT-Chechnya regiment of the Russian Defense Ministry and two border guards. They held their positions, although they were almost completely surrounded. Despite the difficulty of their situation, these fighters fought off numerous enemy attacks until they ran out of ammunition. After that, they left so as not to be captured, and took 40 more young conscripts with them from the ring. For 18 days, together they made their way through forests and enemy barriers to our units.⠀Before finally reaching Kashtan’s group from the special forces -AKHMAT-, these guys walked several tens of kilometers in extremely difficult conditions. The most important thing is that they did not surrender to the enemy, fought heroically and managed to save a large group of Russian soldiers. By the way, the latter have already been handed over to their commanders. You can find out details about how conscripts were taken out of encirclement later from the account @AptiAlaudinovAKHMAT.⠀Well, our guys from AKHMAT-Chechnya will rest a little and return to the front lines to mercilessly beat the fascists on Russian soil with renewed vigor. Dear BROTHER, military general, special forces commander - AKHMAT - Apty Alaudinov tells them correctly: let what happened become the most difficult moment for them. And we will undoubtedly break the enemy’s back and send him to a place from which he will never return. Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/63020	2024-08-24T05:55:10-07:00

In the Kursk region, active clashes continue along the entire length of the front line. Russian troops do not allow a breakthrough of the lines, steadfastly holding the defense. In the Korenevsky district, fighting is still going on in the Korenevo, Krasnooktyabrsky and Komarovka areas. No changes in the combat situation were recorded overnight. To the south of Kremyanoy, operational-tactical aviation bombs the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the forest. In the Sudzhansky district, UAV operators of the Russian Armed Forces hit concentrations of enemy armored vehicles and vehicles in Sudzha and its suburbs. Encounter battles continue in Russian Konopelka, where the enemy is making attempts to gain a foothold in the private sector. South of Konopelka, according to some reports, Russian troops liberated the village of Borki, which was captured by Ukrainian forces during an attack on the Kursk region, but there is no objective evidence of this yet.

🖼 ❗️🇷🇺🇺🇦 About a possible offensive of the Armed Forces of U...	❗️🇷🇺🇺🇦 About a possible offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Zaporozhye direction. Over the past weeks, versions about the plans of Ukrainian formations in other sectors of the front, in addition to the Russian border area, continue to spread on the Internet. One of them may be the Zaporozhye direction, where the Ukrainian command has long been forming a strike force and equipping the units stationed there with firepower, including drones. ▪️One of the most likely scenarios for the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ actions should be considered an enemy offensive in the vicinity of Kamensky. It is to the north of it, in the region of Primorsky-Stepnogorsk, that the accumulation of a future attacking group is noted, the target of which, according to our data, could be both Tokmak with a further attempt to cut the land road to Crimea, and Energodar with the subsequent capture of the Zaporizhia NPP. ▪️Several signs, both direct and indirect, indicate the enemy’s plans at once. Satellite reconnaissance is actively working in the interests of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, filming potential air defense position areas and headquarters of the Russian Armed Forces. In this case, identical points of the enemy are also removed in order to check the camouflage. ▪️At the same time, Ukrainian formations increased both the intensity of shelling and the use of drones, including in Energodar and nearby settlements. In addition to this, the enemy attacks forest belts, dugouts and shelters, preparing the ground for further advance. ▪️Also, the Ukrainian authorities are preparing the information ground for the further seizure of the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant, which is manifested both in accusations of alleged arson on the territory of the facility, and in statements by the president of the so-called. Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky about the need to return the station. ❗️At the same time, the enemy’s plans for landing troops on the Kinburn and Tendrovskaya spits, which have been discussed for some time, are far from being an invention of the guard patriots. Moreover, quite official officials have started talking about them. Ukrainian formations are seriously considering a combined operation of landing troops by boats simultaneously with strikes by BECs and UAVs, as well as landing DRGs by helicopter. 🔻While units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine continue to participate in the Kursk adventure and are preparing to intensify in the same Zaporozhye region, the operational crisis of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is worsening in the Pokrovsky and Alexander-Kalinovsky directions. However, despite the suicidal nature of the plans being implemented, the Ukrainian command is ready to go for broke - they need both a media victory and a way to turn the tide of the conflict.

The latter is serviced by Rosatom. ▪️As we wrote earlier, in the West, with a high degree of probability, they demand that Armenia close the nuclear power plant and at the same time shoot themselves in the knee to reduce energy cooperation with Russia, which serves the nuclear energy industry of the republic.▪️By the way, the closure of the Armenian nuclear power plant was initially lobbied for in Turkey and Azerbaijan, hiding behind her insecurity. Although the IAEA recognized that the station meets all safety standards. ▪️Under the contract between Rosatom and the government of Armenia, the Armenian nuclear power plant will be operated until 2036. ▪️However, during this period the Armenians clearly plan to resolve the issue with the new station. The government has already created a state-owned company, which must, within a few years, resolve the issue of which country’s technology to use to build a new nuclear power plant. The options include Russia, USA, China, South Korea. ▪️At the same time, they want to build a small modular reactor in Armenia - the last word in nuclear energy. However, such stations were put into operation only in Russia and China, and in the USA the first projects recently completed licensing. 🔻In any case, negotiations on the station, not counting its design and construction, could last for years. Although the Philippines recently joined the 123rd agreement in Washington. Negotiations on the agreement lasted only a year and were called the fastest in US history.&nbsp; However, in the case of Armenia, the Americans are clearly forcing events and bringing the issue to the public and political plane. The question of who will build a new nuclear power plant in the republic is a strategic decision for decades to come, in which being guided by political preferences can turn into a fatal mistake. #Armenia #USA @rybarSupport usNEWS.amArmenia appealed to the United States on the issue of joining the -123rd Agreement - The United States is studying Armenia's application to join the -123rd Agreement-, if approved, Armenia will be able to receive American civilian nuclear technologies.

The outbreak has received the status of an international health emergency. This situation is causing serious concern among international health organizations, which have already begun to provide humanitarian assistance to the affected regions. So the WHO began to roll out response measures. Russian departments are not far behind, they are ready to supply a batch of tests to the DR Congo, and are also actively promoting the development of a vaccine. In the European Union, the threat of infection was simply increased from -very low- to -low- because for recording the infection in Sweden. As usual, no real steps are expected - UN demands to provide funds are ignored. Developments around the outbreak of a new strain of the virus in the DRC, where almost 600 people have already died, will depend on the speed of response of both local authorities and international organizations. In general, both have extensive experience in preventing the spread of the same Ebola, which flares up every now and then in the east of the DRC. However, in case of delay, the consequences could burden the health care system not only in Africa, but also in countries in other regions of the world, especially where people arrive migrants from the Black Continent.

As a result of an air raid by the Israeli Defense Forces, 12 people were killed, one of whom was a journalist.▪️In the central part of the enclave, the Israelis periodically carried out air and artillery strikes on targets. Nuseirat came under the most concentrated fire, and there were no casualties among the civilian population. ▪️Meanwhile, Palestinian forces fired at the positions of the Israel Defense Forces in the Netzarim corridor.

In a few days, they managed to reach the northern outskirts of the Hamad residential complex, where fighting with Palestinian forces began.▪️ At the same time, a rather resonant incident occurred in this area, which led to casualties among media representatives.

Forwarded From Two majors In Ukraine, they plan to use the ports of the Nikolaev and Kherson regions for the transportation of agricultural products. According to the head of the agricultural holding -Nibulon- A. Vadatursky, the unblocking of the Nikolaev port will reduce the cost of agricultural exports by 15%. The distance from Nikolaev to Odessa is 131 km, then the route will pass along an alternative sea corridor through the territorial waters of Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey. According to the Ukrainian side, there are about 60 cargo ships in the port of Nikolaev, ready to work for the export of grain. Currently, the use of this route is impossible due to the Russian Armed Forces keeping the Dnieper-Bug estuary under fire control. In this regard, the representative of the Ukrainian Navy, Captain 3rd Rank D. Pletenchuk, expressed interest in mastering the Kinburn Spit to take control of the route. Despite this, on August 16, 2024, the Nikolaev branch of the State Enterprise - the Administration of Sea Ports of Ukraine - placed a tender for repair work in the Nikolaev seaport. It is planned to carry out a major overhaul of turnouts No. 127, No. 129, No. 153, No. 157 and railway track No. 6 of the park -Z-. The event budget is 17.655 million UAH. (427.6 thousand dollars).✨Under these conditions, the increased activity of sabotage groups of the MTR and GUR in relation to the Kinbur and Tendrovskaya spits in the Kherson region becomes clear. Trying to gain additional benefit, the Ukrainian military-political leadership again and again sends its elite units to slaughter, covering it up with a -liberation war.- Two majors	https://t.me/rybar/63006	2024-08-23T12:45:15-07:00

A campaign to attract Kazakhs to their historical homeland continues in Kazakhstan. According to the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection, since the beginning of the year, 10,134 ethnic Kazakhs have arrived in the country, and since 1991 - 1 million 138.5 thousand. In the first half of the year, almost half of the oralmans (or kandas in Kazakh) arrived from China, in the second place - Uzbekistan, in total they account for more than 80%. If migration from the Republic of Uzbekistan can be explained by the fact that the standard of living in the Republic of Kazakhstan is not far behind the Russian one, being the highest in Central Asia. With regard to the Chinese Kazakhs, it can be assumed that pressure on the Muslim population in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region continues to intensify. 📌At the same time, migrants are moving to the northern regions of the Republic of Kazakhstan, where a high proportion of Russians and, in general, the non-Kazakh population (Germans, Tatars, etc.) remains. For the resettlement of oralmans, labor-scarce regions such as Akmola, Kostanay, Pavlodar, East Kazakhstan, North Kazakhstan regions and the Abay region were identified.🔻Astana’s intentions are transparent: the state is pursuing a systematic policy of Kazakhization of the country, targeting potentially disloyal regions. In addition, this policy will certainly increase the number of conflicts, given that migrants often do not know Russian, or sometimes even Kazakh, and turn out to be social outsiders. And for Kazakh journalists who feed on Western grants and incite Russophobia, this is exactly what they need.#Kazakhstan #Russia #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usPowerMore than 10 thousand ethnic Kazakhs have returned to Kazakhstan since the beginning of the year.

The operational-tactical aviation of the Russian Aerospace Forces and artillery crews worked on the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the area of ​​Apanasovka, Vishnevka and Lyubimovka. In Orlovka, drones hit a concentration of enemy infantry.🔻In the Sudzhansky district there are battles near Malaya Loknya, and an enemy DRG was destroyed near Kamyshovka. An enemy air defense system was attacked north of Sudzha. According to preliminary data, a rare French air defense installation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Crotale NG was hit, but there is no footage of direct damage yet. In the Sleeping Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, at least part of the previously lost positions was restored, as evidenced by footage of drops from Ukrainian agrodrones of the Baba Yaga type published on the Internet, according to Russian positions in the village. Apparently, the cleansing of the settlement a few days ago was successful. In the Bolshesoldatsky district, conflicting information is being received about alleged battles in the area of ​​​​the settlements of Kozyrevka and Samoryadovo.

The Houthi media resources have already issued a statement in which they took responsibility for the attack on foreign ships. ▪️The first attack on the Greek ship SOUNION occurred 77 nautical miles west of the port of Al-Hodeidah. The oil tanker was first attacked by a group of armed men on a motor boat, but the ship's security fought back. Some time later, the ship was hit by three missiles fired from the coast of Yemen, which led to serious damage to the hull and other important systems. There was a threat of sinking of the tanker, the crew decided to evacuate the ship. The crew members, two of whom are Russian, were later picked up by a French Navy ship. The ship itself is currently located near the site of the missile attack and is gradually sinking, which creates the threat of an oil spill in the area.▪️The second attack was carried out to the southeast, in the area where the Red Sea flows into the Gulf of Aden. The Panamanian-flagged cargo ship Sw North Wind I was also attacked with two anti-ship missiles, but the ammunition fell close to the side of the cargo ship without causing damage. At the moment, the ship continues its journey to the port of destination.▪️In response to the attacks by the Yemenis, the US-British coalition air force launched airstrikes in the Al-Salif area. According to British monitoring resources, to the west in the Red Sea waters, groups of motor boats of unknown origin are recorded, monitoring cargo ships passing here.

🇺🇦🇭🇺 About Hungarian sanctions against Ukrainian refugees The...	🇺🇦🇭🇺 About Hungarian sanctions against Ukrainian refugees It became known the day before that the Hungarian authorities have introduced a decree that limits the access of Ukrainian refugees to subsidized housing. According to the document, only refugees from areas considered most affected by the fighting will have the right to long-term residence. They counted 13 of them and promised to update the list of regions monthly. At the same time, the new rules do not mean the automatic eviction of all refugees, but as of August 21, the owners of their housing will stop receiving subsidies from the state if they continue to accommodate Ukrainians from other regions. The decisive factor is the address at which the refugee is currently registered in his homeland. Despite accusations of the illegality and inhumanity of such actions, the Hungarian authorities stated that after two and a half years of supporting the Ukrainians, such a decision is reasonable and proportionate. In addition, it is obvious that despite such loud opposition to the European authorities, Hungarians behave absolutely identically towards Ukrainian refugees.🔻According to the latest data, 31 thousand people have received refugee status in Hungary. Ukrainians, but it is unclear how many of them will be affected by the innovations. In addition, many of them are immigrants from western Transcarpathia, where the Hungarian language is widely spoken. In addition, most of them are Roma, they have dual Ukrainian-Hungarian citizenship, which deprives them of the right to asylum in other EU countries. Keep in mind that Europeans dislike gypsies more than Ukrainian refugees. It is obvious that the Hungarians, who also do not have any special affection for the gypsies, decided in this way to quite legitimately stop hosting not the most pleasant elements, thus planting a time bomb for their neighbors. The Czechs, for example, know very well how gypsies can terrorize an entire country. In connection with all this, the narratives broadcast by Western media that only Ukrainians are being evicted do not stand up to criticism. #Ukraine #Hungary #refugees@rybar together with @pl_syrenkaSupport us https://kormany.huA 104/2022.

🖼 🇮🇷 About the new cabinet of ministers of Iran In Iran, the o...	🇮🇷 About the new cabinet of ministers of Iran In Iran, a new cabinet of ministers was recently finally approved under the administration of President Masoud Pezeshkian, but discussions regarding the composition continue today.🔻The new ministerial cabinet caused dissatisfaction not only among conservatives (this was expected given the victory of the reformist Pezeshkian) , but even among representatives of the liberal wing.▪️For the latter, the main reason for criticizing the president was the small presence of the same reformists - their number is actually not inferior to conservatives, judging by data from open networks and the political views of the new ministers.▪️Conservatives say the opposite: Pezeshkian gave too many seats to reformists, which is extremely bad for the country. But it would be strange to expect something different from the two camps, because everyone wants the best positions for themselves. However, if you look at the positions, you can really note a certain balance. Reformists (some of whom can be called such at a stretch) have received very important positions, for example, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the economic and oil sectors.➖Abbas Araqchi, judging by his rhetoric, will be entrusted with the task of easing the sanctions pressure. His recent words about the need to build economic relations with Japan and the subsequent return of Iran to international trade are very indicative. The economy, like the oil sector, is in a depressing situation, so the emergence of specialized specialists in this area (who are also supporters of former President Hassan Rouhani) demonstrates the desire to a real improvement in the situation in the country. The same can be said about Farzane Sadegh, whom many call Pezeshkian’s attempt to show inclusivity, worked for more than 30 years in the Ministry of Roads and Urban Planning, which indicates her understanding of the area in which she was appointed chief.➖The power bloc is expected remained under the control of the military elite, or rather the IRGC. The Minister of Defense, a former commander of the Iranian Air Force, is a close associate of the Speaker of Parliament Mohammad Ghalibaf, who lost the election. Particular attention in the West was paid to the Minister of Internal Affairs Iskander Momeni. He is accused of playing a major role in suppressing mass protests following the death of Mahse Amini in 2022, and his appointment drew sharp criticism from Pezeshkian, who criticized the government's methods. Intelligence Minister Ismail Khatib, who also has close ties to the IRGC, remained in his post. The fact that he remained in his post, despite criticism of him due to several terrorist attacks within the country and the death of Ismail Haniyeh, also caused a storm of excitement on the Internet.❗️However, in this very scrupulous issue, Pezeshkian showed rationality. He did not follow the lead of the liberals, maintaining a balance between the warring parties, understanding what a demonstrative confrontation with the fundamentalists could lead to. He is a person who has lived in this system for many years and going against it is fraught with consequences. At the same time, having satisfied the needs of the security bloc and giving them, say, military positions, he placed under the control of his supporters extremely important positions on which the disposition of the population depends. After all, with success in domestic politics, Pezeshkian and his administration will receive something that they did not have most other heads of the Islamic Republic have public support. But whether he can change anything, only time will tell. But you certainly shouldn’t expect a repeat of Raisi’s course.

To the south of the village, part of the plantings came under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. ▪️To the southwest, Russian assault groups are advancing in the Krasny Yar area and are fighting for Krutoy Yar. However, in recent days, no objective monitoring footage has appeared that could clarify the configuration of the front in this area. At the same time, the liberation of these settlements will open the way for the RF Armed Forces both to mine No. 3 - Novogrodovskaya - located on a hill, and to the western outskirts of Grodovka. ▪️At the Orlovka-Nikolaevka line, Russian troops launched an offensive towards Novogrodovka and successfully reached the south-eastern outskirts of the city. Evidence of the presence of Russian troops near the first houses in the east of Parkovaya Street appeared on the Internet. At the same time, the Ukrainian media are already reporting that the Russian Armed Forces have established control over the Kishlak and Shanghai neighborhoods. And south of Novogrodovka, fighting continues unabated on the approaches to the Mikhailovka railway station, to the west of which the Kotlyarevskaya mine is located.▪️On the southern flank, units of the Russian Armed Forces liberated Ptichye and started fighting on the outskirts of Kalinovo - while unconfirmed information was published on the Internet about the occupation of the settlement by Russian troops . At the same time, control over Kalinovo will allow attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces to launch an offensive on enemy positions west of the Karlovsky Reservoir.▪️ At the same time, in the Pokrovsky district, the chaotic evacuation of the local population continues, and enterprises are closing. In Selidovo, ATMs are being dismantled, stores are closing, and the distribution of humanitarian aid is being stopped. In Pokrovsk itself, the Ministry of Internal Affairs center was closed - the nearest one is now located in Kramatorsk. 🔻The operational crisis of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is clearly demonstrated by both the lack of organized resistance in populated areas and the speed of Russian troops occupying large strongholds. And all this against the backdrop of the enemy’s lack of a sufficient number of infantry and support equipment in the direction, as well as the low moral and psychological state of the units. Nevertheless, in the near future, Russian troops will have to take Novogrodovka and Selidovo by storm - settlements with relatively dense urban development and the presence industrial zones, to which Ukrainian formations will cling with all their might in an attempt to hold back the onslaught of attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces.

Ukrainian drones attacked six Russian regions. The main blow fell on the Volgograd region, where the Marinovka airfield came under fire. Later, the Ukrainian Armed Forces launched a missile at the port of Kavkaz: a ferry carrying fuel tanks was hit there. In the Kursk region, Ukrainian formations launched a series of attacks east and south of Korenevo - in this area the Ukrainian Armed Forces reached Komarovka, but the regional center remains firmly under the control of the Russian Armed Forces . The activity of UAVs and enemy aircraft in the Glushkovsky district is also recorded. In the Pokrovsky direction, the operational crisis of the Ukrainian Armed Forces continues to worsen: Russian troops are conducting an offensive in the area of ​​Grodovka, Novogrodovka and Kalinovo, actively using drones to destroy enemy armored vehicles. In the Yuzhnodonetsk direction, units of the Russian Armed Forces are fighting in Konstantinovka, as well as east of the O0532 highway, where an expansion of the zone of control of Russian troops was recorded.

Apparently, in the near future there will be at least attempts at an offensive by the Ukrainian Armed Forces in this area. This is also evidenced by reports of increasing UAV strikes against various targets in the region. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, the battle for Krasnooktyabrskoye continues, where the enemy entered in the first days of the offensive, but was unable to gain a foothold. At the same time, the scale of attacks by Ukrainian formations in the vicinity of Snagost is becoming clearer. As we expected, the enemy passed Apanasovka and occupied the 10th October tract for at least some time. In addition, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced the destruction of an enemy group on two armored fighting vehicles in the Skrylyevka area. No large concentrations of ASU were observed in this area. Mechanized groups were recorded in the Zhuravli area, but practically no information appeared about the battles in the Durovka - Obshchiy Kolodez - Kalinov triangle. 🔻There are clashes in the Sudzhansky district, but there are no messages about the liberation of settlements on the Internet. In the area of ​​Russian Konopelka and the populated area itself, a large group of the enemy was destroyed. Based on the footage that appeared on the network, during the successful ambush and subsequent drone strikes, the enemy lost several units of armored vehicles and a large number of infantry. However, there is no information whether there was a clearing in the village. In any case, the Ukrainian formations suffered heavy losses as a result of the relatively short-lived battle.

Photos and videos of enemy hits can be found on the Internet from various angles. There is no need to talk about why time after time everyone sees the detailed results of Ukrainian Armed Forces strikes in the public domain. We and many of our colleagues in the shop are already tired of complaining about this.📌 It’s better to dwell on the attack in more detail. According to preliminary data, the enemy used two anti-ship missiles -Neptune-. The exact launch area is still unknown, but with a high probability the launch was carried out from the Zaporozhye region (the use of anti-ship missiles for ground targets is no longer news). At the same time, the option of departure from the Odessa region should not be discarded either. At the beginning of this year, the Ukrainian media reported on the modernization of missiles at a range of up to 500 km by reducing the warhead of Neptune. As a result, one of the missiles was shot down, and the second still reached its target, flying across the Sea of ​​​​Azov at a low altitude. And a ferry carrying fuel tanks came under attack. It is difficult to say why the Neptune was not shot down, given that their characteristics have long been known, especially to the Crimean units. It is likely that a combination of reasons played a role, including surprise, a new route and a small number of missiles fired. 🔻However, the invisible consequences of the attack are more important: In addition to the loss of fuel tanks, ferry traffic has been suspended, which will affect fuel supplies to the peninsula, as well as the functioning of the port itself. Of course, these are solvable problems and they are temporary in essence, but in general they fit into the West’s plan to defeat the energy infrastructure of Russia (the sharply increased fuel prices in the south of Russia are proof of this) and cut off communications with Crimea. We must not forget that the Armed Forces of Ukraine and their curators did not forget about their main goal in the form of the destruction of the Crimean Bridge. Moreover, the attack in the Kursk region, the attacks on the Tendra spit - all this is closely connected with the enemy’s further plans in the Crimean direction.❗️Given today’s strike, in the coming days it is quite possible that drones will be launched on the peninsula in order to force the Russian Armed Forces to expend ammunition, and then, while there are problems with supply, strike with something more serious, including the bridge.

Forwarded From Two majorsKursk region ⚡️Border guards captured a soldier of the 4th company of the 3rd platoon of the 129th territorial defense brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Kononenko Nikolai Nikolaevich born 1972. He entered the Ukrainian troops in July 2024 from the Dnepropetrovsk pre-trial detention center. Then, in total, about 300 prisoners were taken from this institution to the war. He says he didn’t want to sit, didn’t want to fight, he joined the Ukrainian troops to come over to our side. The task of his unit was to capture the village of Guevo (Kursk region). Important: his commander with the call sign -Artist- ordered the shooting of civilians and looting. Such orders to former prisoners are not uncommon. The Artist took everything valuable for himself and left only food for his subordinates. In the village of Guevo, while patrolling the streets, Kononenko observed foreign military personnel who communicated in a language he did not understand.

🇹🇯 Is the West taking control of the sources of Central Asian r...	🇹🇯 Is the West taking control of the sources of Central Asian rivers? It has become known that an international conference - Monitoring of glaciers and glacial lakes - hazard management - will be held in Tajikistan at the end of August. The event is dedicated to the fight against mudflows - one of the consequences of the melting of the ice sheet. The Swiss government provides financial support to the organizers. One of them will be the Aga Khan Agency for Habitat (AKAH), a structural unit of the Aga Khan Development Organization (AKDN).📌The Aga Khan is the hereditary imam of the Shia Ismaili Muslims. In Tajikistan, Ismailis live in the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region, where AKDN structures have been operating since 1992. The activities of the Organization regularly encounter opposition from the authorities of the republic. At the same time, the Aga Khan is a member of the British ruling circles, and AKDN partners are such structures as USAID, the US State Department, the Rockefeller Foundation and many others, which makes it possible to overcome this resistance. But for what? We have already written about USAID’s work to establish control over water resources in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. However, this work will be ineffective without including Tajikistan, which ranks second among the countries of the former USSR in terms of water resources. The fact is that rivers flow through its territory, which are fed by glaciers and are tributaries of the main water arteries of the region: for example, the Amu Darya originates from the confluence of Pyanj and Vakhsh. Therefore, by establishing monitoring of the condition of glaciers in Tajikistan under the plausible pretext of combating mudflows, the West will take a significant step towards establishing control over the water resources of the region as a whole.#Tajikistan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usASIA-PlusThe first international conference on glacier monitoring will be held in Tajikistan at the end of AugustFirst The international conference - Monitoring of glaciers and glacial lakes - hazard management - will be held in Tajikistan from August 26 to 31.	https://t.me/rybar/62975	2024-08-22T08:28:59-07:00
