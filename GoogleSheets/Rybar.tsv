Forwarded From Kirill Fedorov / War History Weapons (Stanislav Belenky)🇷🇺🇺🇦 On August 12 in Ukraine, the National Anti-Corruption Agency, supervised by the American Embassy, ​​detained Deputy Minister of Energy Alexander Hale. They accepted him for accepting a bribe of half a million dollars; The bureau agents were also assisted by Minister German Galushchenko himself. It would seem, why is a military blogger writing about this event? The news is from a completely different sphere! In fact, it relates to what is happening at the front as a marker event. But the whole point is what exactly the official was supposed to receive a bribe for. So, a certain coal mining company from Western Ukraine, where there have been mines since Austrian times, asked Heil to help them remove valuable and rare equipment from a state mine... in the Pokrovsky district of the Donetsk region. Now it should be clearer to the reader what the significance of this case is. We remember that the Braves are actively advancing in the direction of Pokrovsk, and the pace of advancement itself is increasing as the operational crisis in the Ukrainian Armed Forces worsens. And the day is not far when the Russian army will begin and complete the liberation of the Pokrovsk agglomeration. In these conditions, it is clear to business, devoid of ideological blinders, that it is necessary, as our respected Chinese partners say, to rob in case of fire - once the city is surrendered, then at least for yourself in Galicia you can get hold of valuable equipment. Kirill has already written about the importance of Pokrovsk in military terms, but it also has economic significance. The fact is that only and exclusively in the Pokrovskaya agglomeration coking coal is mined for the Ukrainian metallurgical industry, and without this raw material this industry will stop completely. And this, in turn, will mean the disappearance of a large and important source of the country’s export income. In this context, the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ adventure in the Kursk region, instead of protecting a strategically important city, looks, in line with Miliukov’s famous speech, stupidity or treason. But that's not all. Those same 25 km from Pokrovsk to the west are Pavlograd, Dnepropetrovsk region. This is an industrial center and a strategically important railway junction, through which it still flies, and with the approach of the LBS to it, it will be even more so. And these problems for Ukraine will not be of an operational-tactical nature, but of a strategic nature. And this is a completely different story.TelegramRybar🇷🇺🇺🇦Pokrovsky direction: the breakthrough of the Russian Armed Forces to Grodovka, battles on the approaches to Novogrodovka and the worsening of the operational crisis of the Armed Forces of UkraineSituation as of 21:00 on August 15, 2024 In addition to the Alexander-Kalinovsky direction, the depressing situation of the Ukrainian ...	https://t.me/rybar/62827	2024-08-15T18:47:52-07:00

Forwarded From RosgVardeetsRybar writes that in order to eliminate problems with interdepartmental interaction, a Coordination Council was created by decision of Defense Minister Belousov. If you look at the entire system from the inside, it looks like many disparate states fighting among themselves. The problem of interaction between adjacent units that fight side by side is still at the forefront. Just think about it. Example. Allied forces are going to attack, we find out about this after the fact, when they walk past us, that is, we are not ready to cover them and are not ready to pull them out. This is one of the most common situations at the front. Now imagine that now all the offices have gathered in the Kursk region, which, except for regional exercises, have never interacted, and such exercises were not carried out everywhere. Moreover, all these problems were shown by the first year of the war, when the Defense Ministry did not understand what to do with the Russian Guard, and the Russian Guard did not understand how to work with the Defense Ministry. There were so many stupid situations, including the Kharkov regrouping, when the Ministry of Defense began to retreat without warning the Russian Guard about this. Has anyone drawn any conclusions? No! And now we have received the fact that we have reserves, but we cannot use them to their full potential, because there is no understanding and experience of interaction. Very often, interaction is established at the level of horizontal connections, and this is done by ordinary soldiers and commanders of a level not higher than a platoon/company commander. As a result, there are several departments that cannot establish interaction with each other.

In just one day, about three dozen attacks were repulsed. Despite a slight decrease in the intensity of the fighting compared to previous days, the situation is currently far from stabilizing. In the Lgovsky district, the voluntary evacuation of the local population continues, meanwhile, Ukrainian formations do not stop artillery shelling. In the Korenevsky district, near Safonovka, details of the repulse of a recent attack by an armored group have appeared The Ukrainian Armed Forces consisted of at least five vehicles: the enemy convoy was ambushed and shot from both sides, the personnel were destroyed.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, the situation did not undergo significant changes by the end of the day. Fighting and attacks by Ukrainian sabotage groups continue in the area. In the Malaya Loknya area in Nikolaevka, a fighter of the local self-defense squad burned an abandoned BMP-1 of the Ukrainian Armed Forces with a canister of gasoline. In the Belovsky district in the evening, clashes began for the settlement of Spalnoe near the recently liberated village of Krupets.

Russian troops attacked Ukrainian Armed Forces facilities in several regions of the so-called. Ukraine. In the Dnepropetrovsk region, the territory of a machine-building plant in Pavlograd was hit, and not far from Poltava, an ammunition depot in Terentievka was hit. In the North Ukrainian direction, Ukrainian formations are seeking to expand the zone of control in several districts of the Kursk region. Units of the Russian Armed Forces respond with regular strikes on places where Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel and equipment are concentrated, and also hold back enemy advances. In the Slobozhansky direction, Ukrainian formations carried out an attack on the positions of the Russian Armed Forces in the area of ​​the Kolotilovka international checkpoint and for some time occupied the territory of the checkpoint. Later, Russian troops knocked the enemy out of their positions and regained control of the crossing. In the Alexander-Kalinovsky direction, Russian troops made significant progress on the approaches to Dzerzhinsk and almost completely liberated Kirovo. In Novgorod, the Russian Armed Forces completely occupied the eastern outskirts of the settlement and cleared out the pocket between Novgorod and Balka Shiroka. In the Pokrovsky direction, Russian troops liberated Orlovka and gained a foothold on the southeastern outskirts of Zhuravka. Footage has also appeared confirming the control of the Russian Armed Forces over the central part of Nikolaevka.

Forwarded From ARCHANGEL SPECIAL FORCES Z🇷🇺🪖 Stills from the video of the 8th Special Forces Regiment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine operating in the Kursk region. Ukrainian Special Forces officers use red tactical ribbons/bandages to organize ambushes and operations in rear areas. We ask the soldiers of the Russian Armed Forces to be extremely careful so as not to run into an enemy posing as their own! Such actions on the part of the enemy are logical, because This is one of the direct purposes of these units - to operate in the rear. And, given that the line of defense is not built in the Kursk region, the Ukrainian Armed Forces resort to these types of camouflage. The main goal of the enemy’s tactics is to increase the chances of survival of their groups and remain undetected. Move around populated areas without attracting the attention of both civilians and Russian military. In addition, by dressing in the uniform of the Russian Armed Forces and gaining trust, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have more opportunities to be the first to enter the battle. In this regard, counterintelligence measures should be strengthened in this direction. Archangel of Special Forces. Subscribe.	https://t.me/rybar/62819	2024-08-15T13:17:01-07:00

Meanwhile, the total number of Palestinian deaths since the beginning of the escalation has already exceeded 40 thousand. In the south of the enclave, the Israelis again announced an evacuation east of Khan Yunis, once again resorting to reducing the humanitarian zone. However, the expected offensive by the Israel Defense Forces never materialized. Engineering work by the 162nd Armored Division -HaPlada- continues along the Philadelphia Corridor. Israeli troops are demolishing the remaining buildings at a distance of a kilometer from the border of the Gaza Strip with Egypt. In the West Bank, Israeli security forces carried out another series of raids, detaining suspects with links to Hamas. The largest Israeli operation took place in Nablus, where two local militants were eliminated. The usual strikes by the parties continue on the Lebanese-Israeli border, which this time led to fires both in the south of Lebanon and in the north of Israel. Nevertheless, the situation remains relatively stable for now. 🔻A detailed analytical report on events in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_botHigh resolution mapEnglish version#digest #map #Israel #Palestine #report@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62818	2024-08-15T12:31:47-07:00
🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦Pokrovsk direction: breakthrough of the Russian Armed ...	🇷🇺🇺🇦Pokrovsky direction: the breakthrough of the Russian Armed Forces to Grodovka, battles on the approaches to Novogrodovka and the worsening operational crisis of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Situation as of 21:00 on August 15, 2024. In addition to the Alexander-Kalinovsky direction, the depressing situation of the Ukrainian formations is also developing in the Pokrovsky sector, where In recent days, Russian troops have been able to significantly expand the zone of control. Currently, the enemy is preparing for defense in the Grodovka-Novogrodovka sector. Both of these settlements are the last major lines of defense of the Ukrainian Armed Forces before Pokrovsk - one of the key transport hubs of the Donbass enemy group.▪️On the northern flank, Russian troops are fighting on the approaches to Novotoretskoye, where the crossing of the Kazenny Torets River takes place. Earlier, the Russian Armed Forces liberated Ivanovka and Lisichnoye, which allowed them to reach the outskirts of the settlement, breaking through several enemy defensive lines. North of Novotoretsk, the Armed Forces of Ukraine equipped a large fortified area covering the approaches to the N-32 Pokrovsk-Konstantinovka highway. Probably, the main efforts of the Russian Armed Forces on the northern flank in the near future will be concentrated on the liberation of Vozdvizhenka and further advance towards the highway with the aim of cutting it. ▪️In the central sector, after successfully capturing the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the area of ​​the ruins of a brick factory, Russian troops entered the southeastern outskirts of Grodovka. Assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces are gradually moving along Donetskaya Street, while the territory of the clay quarry located to the south remains in the gray zone. The offensive is also taking place to the northeast of the settlement, where Russian troops are pushing out Ukrainian formations from positions in forest belts. The enemy notes the high efficiency and number of Russian drones that disrupt supplies and hit armored vehicles of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. ❗️In the area of ​​the O-05-44 highway, immediately behind Grodovka, the enemy is installing a new defense line designed to stop the advance of Russian troops in this area. It is known about at least four large strongholds built at a higher altitude relative to the village itself, which gives the Ukrainian Armed Forces an advantage both in visual observation capabilities and in adjusting artillery and mortar fire. Nevertheless, it is clearly not worth talking about the inaccessibility of this fortified area - during the battles for Vesele, Russian troops overcame a similar line of defense of Ukrainian formations in just a few days. ▪️On the southern flank, units of the Russian Armed Forces, relying on Sergeevka, carried out a series of attacks, as a result of which the settlement of Orlovka was liberated. In neighboring Zhuravka, fighting appears to be continuing, and at least the south-eastern outskirts of the village are under the control of Russian troops. We should soon expect Russian troops to pull up the left flank and storm the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Novozhelenny area. There are reports of the start of battles for Novogrodovka, where a large railway junction of the Ukrainian Armed Forces is located, and a 20-hour curfew has been introduced in the city. Located just three kilometers to the east, Nikolaevka is already under the control of the Russian Armed Forces: the enemy published footage of the landing at the western exit of the village.🔻So far, the authorities of the so-called. Ukraine is savoring information victories in the Kursk region, the position of the Ukrainian Armed Forces group in the Pokrovsky direction continues to rapidly deteriorate. After the Russian troops occupy Grodovka and Novogrodovka, the path to Pokrovsk and Mirnograd will be open. Units of the Russian Armed Forces threaten important enemy communications not only in this area, but also in the Selidovo area and the N-32 highway, along which Ukrainian formations are supplied in the Donetsk, Artemovsk and Aleksandro-Kalinovsky directions.

On the one hand, creative the approach to solving the problem and the moral and volitional qualities of a soldier of the RF Armed Forces evoke respect. On the other hand, the situation perfectly illustrates the importance of units having standard SUVs, so that they do not have to use cars purchased with their own money.

Ukrainian formations from time to time make attempts to improve the tactical situation, but they encounter decisive rebuff from Russian troops. In the Lgov region, the enemy fired twice at the administrative center, including using missiles with a cluster warhead. Four civilians are known to be wounded, two of whom are hospitalized, and there is damage to civilian infrastructure and residential buildings. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the area of ​​Snagost, Olgovka, Uspenka and Matveevka were hit. Near Kremyany, an enemy attempt to enter a populated area was repelled, and in Lyubimovka, Lancet UAV operators hit another Kazak armored vehicle of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. According to the Ministry of Defense, Ukrainian formations also advanced in the direction of Sheptukhovka and Kauchuk, but were unsuccessful. In the Mogritsa area, a HIMARS MLRS was destroyed by a missile strike. This is probably the same installation that fired at the bridge in Glushkovo at night: as a result of a direct hit, a rupture of the installation’s ammunition was recorded. In the Sudzhansky district, Russian troops hit enemy concentration areas near Yuzhny, Zaoleshenka and Mirny. Fighting continues on the approaches to Martynovka and near the village of Agronom. The enemy continues to post footage from the western and central parts of Suja. Representatives of the Italian press also visited the occupied city. At the same time, neither side posted any video materials from the eastern outskirts.🔻In the Belovsky district, Russian troops cleared the village of Krupets. Previously, footage of the shelling of Ukrainian positions in Kamyshny, several kilometers to the east, where fighting is currently ongoing, was published.❗️Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Alexander Syrsky announced the creation of a military commandant’s office in the occupied territory of the Kursk region, which will supposedly be engaged in maintaining law and order and ensuring the priority needs of the population. .

It included deputy ministers of defense, heads of military command and control bodies and representatives of the General Staff, as well as heads of constituent entities. The declared goal is to increase the efficiency of providing troops with equipment, weapons and logistics, as well as coordination of actions. Its tasks also include assistance in evacuating the population, timely information and additional measures to ensure protection from shelling. The appearance of this council looks like an attempt to correct the situation with interdepartmental cooperation, at least on the scale of the border area. Until now, all attempts to change something in this matter have looked more like a hasty patching up of holes with improvised means, rather than a radical change in approach. How effective the measure will be is an open question. However, problems with combat control have become so overripe that they now have to be solved literally manually, including by creating appropriate superstructure structures in addition to existing ones. In the end, if there is no other working option, then even the most non-trivial means are good. If only they gave real results. #WSRF #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/62813	2024-08-15T10:05:06-07:00

Especially to see how the dog does not leave the owner. He doesn't believe that he is no more. And she doesn’t know where to go now. And this is the story of the video. Russian intelligence officers found civilians, ordinary people in Volchansk. We saw from the copter that on the roof of the shelter, on a sheet of iron, SOS was written. Need help. It turned out that two men were sitting in the basement, one of whom was wounded. Russian intelligence officers tried to help them. They sent the copter, dropped off a bottle of water, a first aid kit, and attached a note. Follow the copter, we will take you to a safe place. The men probably wore white T-shirts on purpose so that it could be seen that they were marching peacefully. White flag. And let's go get the copter. The Armed Forces of Ukraine saw two peaceful men in the ruins from a copter. And they killed them with drops and mines. They just took the men and threw them at them. As if they were our own people, Ukrainians. Killed. You know, sometimes it seems like we are at war with absolute evil. It doesn’t matter whether it’s wearing an SS helmet, it’s hitting civilians in Belgorod, it’s evil, it’s chasing a car with children with an FPV drone, or it’s killing two civilians from Volchansk because they went towards Russian positions. Here, probably, a lot of angry, loud words can be said. But is it necessary? What is it for? Still, it’s clear. Just pray for the innocent Russian people who were killed, who lacked a little to escape from the punitive forces. I don't know their names. And I don’t know the scouts. But the Lord knows for sure.
