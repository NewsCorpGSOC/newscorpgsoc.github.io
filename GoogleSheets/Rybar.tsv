The goal of the program is to include the small states of Europe into the single cultural space of the EU. However, the total budget of the project is covered by contributions from the participating countries, which in return receive opportunities to promote projects in Europe.▪️Minister of Culture of Moldova Sergiu Prodan admitted that over several years of participation in the EU-Creative Europe program, the Republic has made contributions of more than €400 thousand. , but in the end she received only €38 thousand for the implementation of her projects. Because of this, the Moldovan government decided to leave the program.▪️However, Prodan blames this exclusively on the Moldovan society, which turned out to be not mature enough to take advantage of the opportunities that opened up. ▪️-The backwardness of Moldavian cultural circles seems to be expressed in the fact that projects about the life of the LGBT community in Eastern Europe were not submitted for grants - this is a real example of one of the applications found. ▪️ Moreover, the European Commission, which oversees the program, is now especially concerned about collecting information about LGBT representatives in the cultural sphere of Europe. 🔻Moldova’s withdrawal from the program and the words of the republic’s Minister of Culture are an excellent example of the contradictory position the state may find itself in on the path to European integration. As a result, the country will have to pay huge sums from its treasury to the EU budget, and in return receive only a small part for its own projects. At the same time, it is imperative to promote the general line in politics, economics and culture, on which the distribution of budgets will depend. However, even for this, Moldova is considered backward by its own leaders. #EU #Moldova @rybarSupport usNewsMaker-Unfortunately, we invested more than we received-.

Forwarded From Operational reports⚡️❗️🚨 The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs has issued advice on information security measures in the Belgorod, Bryansk and Kursk regions. The enemy is massively identifying IP ranges on our territories and connecting to unprotected video surveillance cameras remotely, viewing everything from private courtyards to roads and highways of strategic importance. In this regard, unless there is an urgent need, it is better not to use CCTV cameras. The use of online dating services is highly discouraged. The enemy actively uses such resources for the legendary collection of information. Military personnel should not open any links (hyperlinks) received from strangers in instant messengers or SMS messages and, if possible, avoid using phones with a large amount of both official and personal information in situations where the enemy can gain physical access to them. It is necessary to control and moderate chats, as well as promptly delete from them the accounts of persons captured by the enemy, as well as the accounts of persons whose phones the enemy has gained access to. Do not post on social networks and instant messengers made on a video recorder of video recordings of trips or conduct broadcasts/streams when driving on highways, where military equipment also moves due to the danger of revealing objects significant to the enemy. Military personnel and representatives of law enforcement agencies are recommended to disable the -People nearby - function in the Telegram messenger, remove all photographs indicating departmental affiliation, change nicknames by which you can identify a citizen as a military serviceman or a representative of a law enforcement agency, check your subscriber numbers through specialized resources that parse from phone books. If in the search results your number appears as recorded from third parties in the form -Lyosha FSB- , -Pasha Rosgvardia-, -Misha 123rd regiment-, this number needs to be changed, it is compromised. Employees in the Kursk, Bryansk and Belgorod regions are recommended to close their personal data, remove all geotags and linking photos to geolocations on social networks so that the enemy does not could reveal the actual location of the military and security forces. Employees of the energy industry, including the nuclear industry, need to remove their professional affiliation from social networks so as not to come to the attention of enemy intelligence services. It is necessary to disseminate it as much as possible among friends, colleagues, colleagues and relatives. 🎯 @opersvodki	https://t.me/rybar/62917	2024-08-20T00:41:11-07:00

And if earlier the Turkish army was bound by at least some restrictions regarding foreign forces on the territory of the Government of National Unity (GNU), then with the entry into force of the memorandum of understanding, the situation has changed.▪️From now on, this contingent has legal immunity, and also has unrestricted access to Libyan airspace and territorial waters (of course, only in that part that is controlled by Western authorities).▪️These decisions contribute to the growth of autonomy that is granted to Turkish troops as the eastern government begins to consolidate its position.🔻Given that There have been many similar memorandums formally granting extended preferences to Turkey before; the main question in the whole situation is whether the West will go for a full-fledged escalation in Libya in addition to unresolved conflicts in other regions? Or are the curators of Turkish foreign policy represented by London and Washington simply trying to balance the balance of power in the west, while Haftar’s Libyan National Army in the east is supported by the Afrika Corps of the Russian Defense Ministry.#Africa #Libya #Turkey@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇸🇴🇹🇷 About Turkish expansion in SomaliaAfter signing an agreement on Somali-Turkish cooperation in February, Erdogan sent to parliament a proposal to station a contingent of the Turkish Armed Forces in Somalia for 2 years.

The more active Ukrainian mobilization is, the more military personnel appear who would like to be away from the front and certainly do not want to die for the sake of the Kyiv regime. For them, the only way to save their lives is to lay down their arms and surrender. But before you get out, you need to find the courage to go against the authorities, who do not disdain orders to finish off -their own. This story is just about those who succeeded. Synopsis: Ukrainian military personnel do not always really want to fight against the Russian Armed Forces. A considerable part was simply mobilized (some against their will), trained and sent to the front line, where the command sends them into battle, whether they want it or not. Right on the line of combat contact, military personnel of the so-called. Ukrainians are often faced with the fact that the face of their enemy turns out to be more humane than that of their own commanders. Therefore, Ukrainian soldiers often decide to surrender. But the cruelty of Ukrainian commanders who throw people into -meat assaults- and organize barrage detachments for their subordinates has long ceased to be a secret. But at the same time, not everyone will pursue their wounded soldier who is trying to surrender.📌 You can download the comic using the links: RU | EN | AR | CN#Russia #Ukraine @rybarWe hope you liked the comic from our artists.

Din.▪️Then units of the Israel Defense Forces, with the support of armored vehicles, expanded the zone of control to the south all the way to Gamal Abdel Nasser Street and to the west, occupying the outskirts of the Hamad residential complex, where yesterday’s incident with the shelling of a group of journalists took place. It is worth noting that the Israelis had already taken took control of the territory of the complex and cleared it of the presence of Hamas. However, soon after the IDF retreat, the Palestinian forces returned to the area and began conducting incursions from there. The IDF offensive itself takes place in areas of the declared humanitarian zone, which the Israelis have repeatedly reduced in recent months under the pretext of the presence of Hamas militants there. Moreover, even after the announcement of the destruction of Palestinian formations there, it did not return to its previous scale. However, the operations themselves eliminate the presence of Hamas only for a short period of time - after the end of hostilities in the territory of the residential complex, Hamad, the Palestinian formations will most likely be able to calmly return there. A similar game of cat and mouse suits the government of the ultra-Orthodox, who need military action to maintain their power.

🇺🇦🇪🇺 About the situation with underground gas storage facilit...	🇺🇦🇪🇺 About the situation with underground gas storage facilities so-called. Ukraine The network is actively discussing the reduction of gas injection by European traders into underground gas storage facilities (UGS) in the so-called territory. Ukraine - after the spring strikes of the Russian Armed Forces on infrastructure facilities, the volumes are about 10% of the usual level. The assurances of Naftogaz representatives that UGS facilities are operating normally do not impress the EU.🔻How did European traders use Ukrainian UGS facilities? Since the global energy market is controlled by investment funds, they use the seasonality of consumption to make a profit. When oil prices fall, large volumes are purchased and stored in tankers and terminals for sale at higher prices during periods of rising prices and consumption. The situation with gas is similar - in the summer it is pumped into underground gas storage facilities for the purpose of subsequent sale at higher prices during the heating season. For European companies, this is a fairly marginal business, and Naftogaz’s own income from storage services usually amounted to about €200 million. 🔻Assessment of current risks This season, representatives of Naftogaz reduced the price for gas storage by 4 times - from €20 to €5 MW \h. However, this did not attract new clients: in their risk management strategy, the European bankers financing this enterprise assess the risks of further destruction of the onshore infrastructure as very high. According to a representative of the Swiss energy company Axpo Group, nothing will happen to the gas itself, but there is a possibility that get it when you need it. This is reflected in the prices for insurance coverage of such transactions. Thus, the risk is now estimated at more than €1 billion, which sharply reduces the margins of projects using Ukrainian underground gas storage facilities. Guide so-called Ukraine is trying to motivate European clients with the need to continue support, but their arguments are broken by the financial calculations of the Europeans. The destruction of the surface infrastructure of the Naftogaz UGS facility deprives the Kiev regime of financial resources in the amount of approximately €200 million. From an economic point of view, this is more than justified and is sufficient an argument for their systematic fire defeat.#gas #Ukraine #economy@rybarSupport usTelegramFailureEuropean gas traders began to realize that storing valuables with a neighbor - a heavy drinker - is not very prudent, even if he has a large living space.

Ukraine. None of the UAVs were able to hit the railway bridge. Two drones fell near the security post building, slightly damaging the external façade and protective mesh. The third drone flew towards Belaya Berezka, where it crashed in a forest.🔻Against the backdrop of Ukrainian Armed Forces’ strikes on bridges in the Kursk region, some media presented this raid as an attack on a strategic facility. However, the bridge in the Pogarsky district has not been used for a long time, and communication across the Desna passes through both the nearby pontoon crossing and bridges located to the east, including in the Trubchevsk area. However, three kamikaze drones are not enough to destroy such infrastructure, unlike attacks using MLRS. Therefore, a new raid can be considered either as an initial attempt to attack bridges in the Bryansk region, or as an attack on the first target that comes along.
