Especially to see how the dog does not leave the owner. He doesn't believe that he is no more. And she doesn’t know where to go now. And this is the story of the video. Russian intelligence officers found civilians, ordinary people in Volchansk. We saw from the copter that on the roof of the shelter, on a sheet of iron, SOS was written. Need help. It turned out that two men were sitting in the basement, one of whom was wounded. Russian intelligence officers tried to help them. They sent the copter, dropped off a bottle of water, a first aid kit, and attached a note. Follow the copter, we will take you to a safe place. The men probably wore white T-shirts on purpose so that it could be seen that they were marching peacefully. White flag. And let's go get the copter. The Armed Forces of Ukraine saw two peaceful men in the ruins from a copter. And they killed them with drops and mines. They just took the men and threw them at them. As if they were their own people, Ukrainians. Killed. You know, sometimes it seems like we are at war with absolute evil. It doesn’t matter whether it’s wearing an SS helmet, it’s hitting civilians in Belgorod, it’s evil, it’s chasing a car with children with an FPV drone, or it’s killing two civilians from Volchansk because they went towards Russian positions. Here, probably, a lot of angry, loud words can be said. But is it necessary? What is it for? Still, it’s clear. Just pray for the innocent Russian people who were killed, who lacked a little to escape from the punitive forces. I don't know their names. And I don’t know the scouts. But the Lord knows for sure.

Drone operators discovered the installation and drove it all the way to the shelter, after which a successful strike followed with a colorful detonation. And a few hours earlier, Russian troops, all in the same Kursk region, destroyed the British Challenger 2 tank, which last appeared on the front line a year ago in Zaporozhye direction. The vehicle was completely burned out from a hit from one Lancet. In general, this is another evidence that the reconnaissance and fire circuit is increasingly beginning to work as it should. Yes, there are plenty of problems here, but even with last year the contrast is strong, and relative to the very beginning of the Northern Military District this is absolutely heaven and earth. #Kursk #Russia #USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62806	2024-08-15T08:09:05-07:00

However, in recent weeks, the main battles took place only in the Tell al-Sultan area, where Hamas militants still maintain their presence. In other areas of the city, hostilities have practically ceased, and along the entire Philadelphia Corridor, engineering work is being carried out by the 162nd Armored Division - HaPlada - to destroy the underground infrastructure of Palestinian formations. Against this background, quite remarkable footage appeared on the Internet showing a huge accumulation of Israeli armored vehicles at the Rafah checkpoint. It itself was occupied by the Israelis back in May, after which it was used as the main transshipment point and storage place for equipment. In the new footage, you can see a fairly large number of armored bulldozers, which are precisely what are planned to be used to demolish the remaining buildings a kilometer from the border of the Gaza Strip with Egypt. However, judging by the latest satellite images, there are few buildings left there. #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62805	2024-08-15T07:15:35-07:00
🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦 Aleksandro-Kalinovskoe direction: liberation of Artem...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 Alexander-Kalinovsky direction: liberation of Artemovo and significant advance of the Russian Armed Forces in the vicinity of Novgorodsituation as of 16:00 on August 15, 2024 While Ukrainian formations continue to transfer additional forces to the Kursk region, Russian troops continue to rapidly break through in the Alexander-Kalinovsky direction enemy defense, increasingly expanding the zone of control in the Dzerzhinsk agglomeration. ▪️In Druzhba, units of the Russian Armed Forces at the end of last week were able to advance along Sadovaya Street and approach the northern exit from the settlement. Further advance in this area will make it possible to cut the wedge at the Seversky Donets - Donbass canal, where the Ukrainian Armed Forces still hold positions. At the same time, Russian attack aircraft were able to reach Zarechnaya Street in the central part of the village. ▪️In neighboring Kirovo, the main clashes unfolded in the area of ​​Beethoven Street. At the same time, the Ukrainian formations tried to counterattack several times - during one of the attacks, the enemy from the direction of Dzerzhinsk drove a pickup truck to Bazarny Lane, where the landing infantry immediately came under artillery fire. At the moment, this area has been cleared of Ukrainian formations and has come under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. Meanwhile, to worsen the situation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the village, Russian troops attacked in the direction of the Severnaya mine dump, the territory of which is currently already occupied by advanced assault detachments of the Russian Armed Forces. The waste heap itself is important because from it you can view the entire private sector, from which the enemy strikes. ▪️Last ​​night, footage appeared on the Internet confirming the liberation of Artemovo (Zaliznoye). In recent days, Russian troops have controlled almost the entire settlement with the exception of the waste heap of the Artyom mine and the western outskirts, where the enemy until recently offered fierce resistance. Now, with the liberation of Artemovo, the Russian Armed Forces can both intensify the onslaught on Dzerzhinsk and advance towards Nelepovka.▪️In Novgorod (New York), Russian units expanded the zone of control along Molodezhnaya Street. At the moment, servicemen of the Russian Armed Forces are storming the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine near school No. 38 and the phenol plant, which, judging by the latest data, the Russian Armed Forces bypassed from the east, reaching Kievskaya Street. At the same time, occupying the plant itself will cause significant damage to the enemy’s defense, further reinforcing the question of the need to withdraw forces towards Dzerzhinsk. ▪️The situation has also become clearer in the east of the village, which has almost completely come under the control of Russian troops. The RF Armed Forces cleared out the pocket between Shirokaya Balka and Novgorodsky, reaching the private sector of the latter sector, gaining a foothold along Kooperativnaya and Beregovaya streets. In addition, to the west of Novgorodskoye, the zone of control on the approaches to the Sukhaya Balka - Rozovka line has been expanded. At the moment, Ukrainian formations still retain control over the northeastern outskirts, from which, apparently, they will also be forced to retreat to the side in the near future Nonsense. Otherwise, the remaining garrison of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with a high degree of probability will be surrounded due to the closing pincer flank attacks of the Russian Armed Forces. 🔻The operational situation in the Dzerzhinsk agglomeration clearly demonstrates that while the Ukrainian authorities are in every possible way advocating their successes in the Kursk direction and presenting them as an indicator of their capabilities, in other sectors of the front the enemy’s position, to put it mildly, does not inspire much hope. And while the most combat-ready formations of the Ukrainian Armed Forces are losing personnel and armored vehicles in the crucible of battle in the Russian borderland, the remaining forces in the same Alexander-Kalinovsky direction are forced to retreat further and further, surrendering populated areas. But the authorities in Kyiv cannot achieve media victory with this.

The idea of ​​​​the need to create such a Center was expressed at the beginning of last year, against the backdrop of the desire of deputies of the Jokorgu Kenesh Emilbek Zhamgyrchiev and Zhanybek Kydykbaev to control content on social networks, and Shailoobek Atazov - to ban TikTok. ▪️With regard to prohibitions and controls, Bishkek is moving in the same direction as its neighbors. Given the current challenges faced by countries and communities caught up in disinformation campaigns, the trend is understandable. Shouldn't we know? At the same time, the Kyrgyz Center also assumes the responsibility to act proactively in relation to illegal content: this is indicated by the tasks of finding potential points of tension and determining the destructiveness of media actions. 🔻There are enough points of tension in Kyrgyz society: this is the ongoing structural conflict between North and South, the status of the Russian language, and relations with the Uzbek minority. In the current power configuration, in which the North is in the lead, CIIS can become one of the tools for conflict management in the interests of maintaining the current state of affairs. And for some time this will help strengthen the power of the northerner Sadyr Japarov within the elite groups. But whether the Center will be able to maintain a balance and not become an instrument of excessive pressure on the media will be shown in the near future. #Kyrgyzstan #mediatechnology #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usNEWS IN KYRGYZSTANThe Cabinet of Ministers has established a Center for Research of the Information Environment under the Ministry of CultureChairman of the Cabinet of Ministers Akylbek Zhaparov has created a Center for Research of the Information Environment under the Ministry of Culture Ministry of Culture, Information, Sports and Youth Policy.

Russian troops, acting with the support of armored vehicles and aviation, knocked out units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces from the territory of the transition - Ukrainian formations, under attacks from UAVs and artillery, hastily retreated towards Pokrovka in the Sumy region. Nevertheless, the enemy command does not abandon plans to stretch the defensive formations of the Russian Armed Forces, in connection with which we can expect new attempts at attacks in the Krasnoyaruzhsky region, including at the Kolotilovka international checkpoint. #Belgorod #Russia #Ukraine @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62800	2024-08-15T04:44:56-07:00
🇺🇸🇺🇦🖇 About the Western - sensational investigations - of th...	🇺🇸🇺🇦🖇 About Western - sensational investigations - of the - Nord Stream - explosion - For the second day in a row, the Network is replete with articles about the involvement of the so-called. Ukraine to undermine -Nord Streams-. Yesterday, Western media stated that the sabotage was carried out by certain Ukrainian divers, and today they accused the ex-commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Zaluzhny, who allegedly, contrary to the opinion of the CIA, refused to cancel the operation. Surprisingly, for some reason these publications were carried word for word by some Russian publications. Some even began to issue, based on the news, some deep analytics about the impact of these suddenly revealed circumstances on support for the Kyiv regime and other things. Apparently, we will have to repeat what was said again in 2022: the main interested party in the destruction of gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea was the United States — the attitude towards Nord Streams was demonstrated quite openly in Washington long before the explosion. Any activity in this direction simply could not take place without the knowledge of the Americans. Or does anyone seriously believe that someone outsider with special equipment could calmly operate in the territorial waters of NATO countries, and then also escape from the scene unnoticed by everyone? However, the Kiev regime here is the one on whom it is convenient to hang all the dogs - he has long had a corresponding reputation, especially after the terrorist attack in Crocus or his support for Al-Qaeda. So the Western man in the street will easily believe in the involvement of the so-called. Ukraine.❗️Therefore, all the rumors that a Ukrainian territorial entity is behind the Nord Stream explosion are aimed at shifting the focus away from the real organizers and performers. And in all seriousness, to replicate such news is to personally help the USA in this. #mediatechnology #USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport usReutersPoland received German request to arrest Nord Stream suspect but he's left country, prosecutors sayPoland received a European arrest warrant issued by Berlin in connection with the 2022 attack on Nord Stream pipelines, but the suspect, a Ukrainian man named as Volodymyr Z, has already left Poland, Polish prosecutors told Reuters.	https://t.me/rybar/62799	2024-08-15T04:00:03-07:00

In the morning, unconfirmed information began to arrive about the alleged outbreak of clashes on the border in this area, but there is no objective evidence of this. At night, the enemy attacked the bridge in Glushkovo with a HIMARS MLRS: at the moment, due to damage to the bridge, movement along it is possible, although difficult. The situation in the Tetkino area remains tense, but stable.🔻In the Korenevsky district there are battles on the approaches to Korenevo. Previously, the Ukrainian Armed Forces made attempts to bypass the settlement from Krasnooktyabrsky from the south and Vetreno from the north, all attacks were repelled. There has been no information about changes in the configuration of the front over the past 24 hours.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, Russian UAV crew operators are hitting enemy armored vehicles in Mikhailovka and Bondarevka, currently villages under the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. As for the reports about the clearing of Martynovka, the settlement has already changed hands several times. Therefore, at the moment, it is premature to talk about confident control over the village.🔻In the Belovsky district, information was received about the destruction of a DRG group in the village of Borki. The other day, a squad of enemy infantry was captured in this area, which indicates further attempts by the Ukrainian Armed Forces to gain a foothold in this area.❗️Enemy propaganda continues to spread fakes, including about -hundreds of captured conscripts at one strong point-. In fact, the Ukrainian Armed Forces dragged prisoners from different places into one place, who had previously been caught on camera in previous days.

Two idiots in fascist helmets are mocking a local 74-year-old grandfather, posing as Germans. While the stupid Ukrainian propaganda is telling how they care about Russian citizens in the occupied territories, two descendants of underdogs with SS runes on their heads mock their grandfather: -Russian Ivan, drink schnapps, Russian Ivan!- Ya-ya! - Ukrainian Fritz diligently imitates the occupiers of the past. Drunk with success, reveling in their own greatness, putting themselves above others... All this has already happened. History goes in a spiral, the Nazis are again on Russian soil.

Forwarded From Cats and Kramnik's cat Based on the results of Army 2024, there is something to say, and for starters, about the format itself. In the past format, Army was most likely the last. From the customer’s PR point of view, it is clearly redundant and little compatible with the new leadership of the Ministry of Defense; from the manufacturers’ PR point of view, the RAE format in Nizhny Tagil was optimal, where the training ground provided much better opportunities for displaying equipment - without leaving the cash register - and with the current boom in unmanned systems his capabilities are only growing. The annual format of the Moscow region forum was also redundant, taking into account the mandatory participation in the Army, quite expensive for manufacturers, and interfering with participation in other events. It’s a matter of guessing from the tea leaves, but it seems that in the foreseeable future we will see a return to the old format of exhibition work , with the Army-/RAE in Nizhny Tagil once every two years and the concentration of this forum on the military and military equipment of the ground forces, and the development of MAKS and HeliRussia in Moscow with their industry areas.	https://t.me/rybar/62794	2024-08-15T02:11:53-07:00

Strikes using MLRS occurred in the north of the territory occupied by the Moroccan army in the districts of Mahbes and Samarra. The result of the attacks was the destruction of the fortifications of the Moroccan army. All this is being done with the aim of preparing an offensive, as well as exhausting government troops - a similar testing of the waters could have been observed a few months ago.▪️ At the same time, Moroccan troops are using UAVs not to attack the separatists, but to destroy illegal gold deposits that provide income rebels. In particular, one of the mines on Mauritanian territory, which belonged to a refugee camp, was destroyed. Events in the political life of the region are also developing in an interesting way. Thus, due to the support of the French authorities for the Moroccan autonomy plan for Western Sahara, which provides for the entry of the SADR into the kingdom, the Algerian authorities decided to recall their ambassador from Paris. In general, diplomatic demarches have happened before - in 2021, this was dictated by disputes over the colonial heritage of France. But now the background to the crisis in relations between France and Algeria lies in the context of the Western Sahara issue that has come to the fore. All this once again reminds us of the trend of thawing conflicts that has been observed in recent years.

All this contradicts the neutral status of Moldova and has a negative impact on the situation around Transnistria. ▪️Moreover, from the Russian side, Chisinau was strongly recommended not to take steps that would contribute to the escalation of the Ukrainian crisis and directly drag Moldova into it. 📌The information that the military airfield in Marculesti is being prepared for an F-16 base for the Armed Forces of Ukraine has been circulating in the media for a long time. Moreover, as we wrote, the airfield was supposed to be rebuilt as a civil airport. The project with funding was already approved in 2022, but its implementation was suddenly canceled in 2023, when they started talking about the supply of F-16s.▪️The fact that in Moldova there is at least military training for the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as the transfer of Western military equipment, is already It's no secret to anyone. That is why news about the possible deployment of F-16s in Marculesti is being taken seriously. ▪️By the way, the Moldavian Foreign Ministry predictably denied the information. The department also suddenly referred to the neutral status of the republic when it became convenient. After all, President Maia Sandu’s team actively criticizes the neutral status and gravitates towards the idea of ​​joining NATO. At the same time, steps towards the de facto abolition of the neutral status and the active operation of the airfield in Marculesti should be expected only after Sandu’s re-election for a second term in October. In the meantime, the presidential office faces the task of ensuring the election process. #Moldova #Russia #Ukraine @rybarSupport usInterfaxThe Russian Federation expressed concern to Moldova due to information about the basing of Western F-16s in the country.
