It has become known that an international conference - Monitoring of glaciers and glacial lakes - hazard management - will be held in Tajikistan at the end of August. The event is dedicated to the fight against mudflows - one of the consequences of the melting of the ice sheet. The Swiss government provides financial support to the organizers. One of them will be the Aga Khan Agency for Habitat (AKAH), a structural unit of the Aga Khan Development Organization (AKDN).📌The Aga Khan is the hereditary imam of the Shia Ismaili Muslims. In Tajikistan, Ismailis live in the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region, where AKDN structures have been operating since 1992. The activities of the Organization regularly encounter opposition from the authorities of the republic. At the same time, the Aga Khan is a member of the British ruling circles, and AKDN partners are such structures as USAID, the US State Department, the Rockefeller Foundation and many others, which makes it possible to overcome this resistance. But for what? We have already written about USAID’s work to establish control over water resources in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. However, this work will be ineffective without including Tajikistan, which ranks second among the countries of the former USSR in terms of water resources. The fact is that rivers flow through its territory, which are fed by glaciers and are tributaries of the main water arteries of the region: for example, the Amu Darya originates from the confluence of Pyanj and Vakhsh. Therefore, by establishing monitoring of the condition of glaciers in Tajikistan under the plausible pretext of combating mudflows, the West will take a significant step towards establishing control over the water resources of the region as a whole.#Tajikistan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usASIA-PlusThe first international conference on glacier monitoring will be held in Tajikistan at the end of AugustFirst The international conference - Monitoring of glaciers and glacial lakes - hazard management - will be held in Tajikistan from August 26 to 31.	https://t.me/rybar/62975	2024-08-22T08:28:59-07:00

The attitude of our citizens towards state symbols is becoming more valuable and more careful. This is especially evident in inspiring moments when the Russian flag is raised over yet another enemy stronghold or liberated city. Let's hope that every year there will be more and more of these moments. Art in high resolution#art #Russia @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62972	2024-08-22T07:21:57-07:00
🇦🇲🇷🇺🇦🇿 About the reaction of the Armenian media to the meet...	🇦🇲🇷🇺🇦🇿 On the reaction of the Armenian media to the meeting of Vladimir Putin and Ilham Aliyev Emotions in the Armenian media space do not subside after Vladimir Putin’s recent visit to Baku. During the meeting, mainly economic issues were discussed. ▪️However, the Russian President also noted that the stability of the South Caucasus now depends on relations between Azerbaijan and Russia.▪️Many Armenian commentators have received another great reason to accuse Russia of betraying Armenian interests. Such a reaction once again confirms the complete loss of guidelines and cause-and-effect relationships in the Armenian society. ▪️After all, the Armenian authorities have actually withdrawn themselves from dialogue with Russia, limiting themselves only to anti-Russian statements. Thus, Nikol Pashinyan’s government has only once again shown itself to be an extremely unreliable and intractable partner, which has demonstrably rushed into the arms of the West. True, the latter, in essence, does not give anything constructive to the republic.▪️A sensitive issue is also the unblocking of communications in the region, especially in the Syunik region of Armenia, which in Azerbaijan is called the Zangezur corridor. ▪️Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov recently announced the sabotage by the Armenian side of the process of opening communications in the region.▪️For example, in 2020 there was an agreement that communications would be controlled by border guards of the FSB of the Russian Federation. However, the Armenian authorities changed their minds and are already speaking hostilely about Russian border guards: they have already been taken out of Zvartnots airport, and Pashinyan furiously declared that the Russians do not have a mandate to ensure security in Syunik. Now there are observers from the EU there who are engaged in active PR on social networks against the backdrop of the destruction of the regional security system. It is not surprising that with such introductions, Armenia continues to lose political sovereignty: as we previously wrote, Yerevan’s position on international issues is no longer taken into account by anyone. While Western players, through the decisions of Pashinyan’s team, are increasingly entering the region, it is more than logical for the Russian side to stop taking into account the opinion of the authorities in Yerevan, which in no way corresponds to the interests of Armenia itself. #Azerbaijan #Armenia #Russia @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇷🇺🇦🇿 Statements by the Presidents of Russia and Azerbaijan after the meeting🔻 Statements by Vladimir Putin: ▪️Russia attaches great importance to the development of multifaceted and friendly relations with Azerbaijan. ▪️During the negotiations, a wide range of...	https://t.me/rybar/62971	2024-08-22T05:59:28-07:00

🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦 Strengthening the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Pokr...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 Strengthening the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Pokrovsky direction: how an operational crisis neutralizes the advantages of the defensive lines of the Armed Forces of Ukraine - Rybar Analysis The rapid offensive of Russian troops in the Pokrovsky direction often meets fierce resistance from the enemy, who has equipped hundreds of kilometers of fortifications in the occupied part of the DPR. Most of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ fortifications are platoon and company strongholds with a developed firing and camouflage system, which turns each assault on such a fortification into a separate operation. Sometimes Russian units encounter fortifications that are truly monstrous in size, playing the role of key defense centers of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. ▪️A striking example of this is a large stronghold east of Zhelanny First, taken by the Russian Armed Forces during the fighting in this area in July. This defensive unit began to be built by the enemy, presumably shortly before the retreat of the Ukrainian Armed Forces from Avdeevka, and was supposed to become an impassable obstacle for Russian units due to its location and size. A large system of trenches and equipped firing points, located in an open field and covered by UAVs and artillery is indeed capable of stopping the advance of even large military formations for a long time in conditions of air superiority of various types of drones. Even smaller fortifications, with proper defense and well-established communication among units, are capable of holding back advances on entire sections of the front for years - Nevelskoye, located to the south, the battle for which lasted more than a year, is proof of this. 🔻Nevertheless, a large stronghold east of Novoselovka First was successfully taken by Russian troops in less than a week of fighting. In conditions of an operational crisis and the inability of the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to competently build interaction between units, this defense center has turned into a huge target for Russian aviation and drones. An additional factor was the fact that the assault units of the Russian Armed Forces attacked the enemy’s stronghold from the northeast, negating many of the advantages of the fortification, erected to hold back the advances of Russian troops from the east. Coordinates: 48.215605, 37.475699▪️Russian units met another large stronghold of the Ukrainian Armed Forces southwest of Timofeevka. Enemy fortifications were erected in the area of ​​the C-05-09-07 highway and covered the crossing over Kazenny Torets, located in a populated area. The enemy's defensive unit was a system of trenches and firing points and, apparently, was adapted for all-round defense. In conditions of a stable front, such a line could stall the advance of Russian troops to Timofeevka and Lisichny and would require significant forces to take it. However, without established communication between units and UAV cover, the strong point was under threat of encirclement and was taken by the Russian Armed Forces within a few days. Coordinates: 48.276491, 37.479241🔻During the special operation, we have repeatedly witnessed how even smaller defensive lines held back the advance of advancing troops on one or another section of the front for a long time. Enemy fortifications in the Kupyansk-Svatovsky, Limansky and Seversky directions have been causing significant problems for the Russian Armed Forces for more than a year due to the geographical features of the area and the positional nature of the combat operations. However, many of the advantages of this kind of fortification are lost in conditions of an operational crisis, similar to what is happening with the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Pokrovsky direction. Even the most powerful enemy defensive positions, in the absence of a sufficient number of infantry and support means to hold them, turn into an easy target for Russian attack aircraft. A separate problem for Ukrainian formations is the low moral and psychological state of the units, which are regularly exposed to attacks from Russian air forces and artillery and are forced to hold unfavorable positions.

Ukrainian formations have not yet attempted to advance and are limiting themselves to attacks on populated areas south of the Seim River and crossings. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, Ukrainian troops, apparently, were able to advance a little more last day than was initially known. Some time after the footage of the strikes in Vishnevka appeared, videos of UAV strikes on a Ukrainian tank on the outskirts of Komarovka were published on the Internet. At the same time, due to the terrain, Ukrainian armored vehicles could appear in a populated area, driving through Vishnevka or the 10th October tract from Apanasivka. At the same time, messages about the presence of the enemy appeared only in the context of Vishnevka - later messages about the complete control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces over the village were published on the Internet. There is relative calm in the Sudzhansky district. Russian troops are striking at identified enemy positions, and the Ukrainian Armed Forces are conducting engineering work in populated areas under their control. 🔻In the Bolshesoldatsky district, according to Russian journalists, the settlement of Nechaevo and the surrounding area were liberated. At the same time, according to our data, the Ukrainian formations did not even enter the village itself, but were stopped in the Obruchye forest area, where they were subjected to several air strikes. Now, apparently, the forest has been cleared. 🔻Meanwhile, the installation of reinforced concrete shelters began in Kursk. Zheleznogorsk and Kurchatov will also be equipped with standard modular buildings.

This time, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense, 28 drones were intercepted in six regions. ▪️The main blow fell on the Volgograd region, where enemy UAVs tried to attack the Marinovka military airfield, where Su-24MR operational-tactical aircraft are also stationed. At the same time, hangars were previously installed at the facility itself, which made it possible to reduce the damage. A significant amount of on-site footage has appeared on the Internet, showing a hit on the airfield and a fire that broke out there. The attack also affected the Volgograd airport, where the reception and departure of aircraft were temporarily suspended. ▪️In the Rostov region, Russian anti-aircraft gunners intercepted Ukrainian drones in the area of ​​Novoshakhtinsk and Krasny Sulin. Apparently, the main target of the Ukrainian Armed Forces was the Morozovsk airfield, which at the beginning of the month came under fire from the Ukrainian Armed Forces. At the same time, in the region, the elimination of a fire on the territory of the Rosrezerv oil depot in the Proletarsky district, which arose as a result of an attack by an enemy UAV, has been ongoing for the fourth day. To date, firefighters have extinguished the fire in six tanks, but the total number of injured employees of the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations has grown to 47 people. ▪️In the Belgorod region, Ukrainian drones attacked the villages of Yasnye Zori and Veselaya Lopan: residential buildings were damaged, but there were no casualties. ▪️Several more drones were intercepted in the Voronezh, Bryansk and Kursk regions - according to the latest information, no damage was recorded there. 🔻In recent weeks, Ukrainian formations have literally carried out one massive raid after another, which clearly demonstrates the high volume of drone production from the enemy - yesterday the Armed Forces of Ukraine launched 45 drones, and already tonight about 30 more devices. At the same time, Ukrainian formations choose both military airfields and fuel and energy infrastructure facilities as their main targets. And, although most UAVs can be intercepted, a few drones often manage to reach their targets. And as we have repeatedly noted, in order to minimize damage and repel such raids, it is necessary to both build hangars and solve the difficulties with organization, interaction and control for intercepting UAVs moving along the same corridors.

At the same time, the footage was published by the enemy, and therefore the outcome of the battle is not obvious and a slightly greater advance is very likely. Between the railway and the Solenenkaya gully, a small success of Russian troops east of the O0532 highway is also recorded. Several forest belts came under the control of the RF Armed Forces.🔻In addition, earlier, by August 18, Russian troops reached the Mylny pond in the Ikryannaya gully south of the dachas of the 3rd mine. At the same time, according to some reports, fighting in the dachas has already begun, but so far this has not been confirmed by objective monitoring personnel. 🔻In the vicinity of Ugledar, the situation remains relatively stable. No attempts at advancement are recorded, and in Pavlovka and Yegorovka, Ukrainian formations carry out UAV strikes on identified places of presence of the Russian Armed Forces.

He declared full support for Moldova on its path to the EU and against destabilization from Russia. ▪️At the meeting they recalled how much Germany is investing in Moldova in connection with the Ukrainian crisis. ▪️For example, Germany, together with France and Romania, has been participating in the Moldova Support Platform since 2022, through which Western countries pour hundreds of millions of dollars into the military and other needs of the country, thereby ensuring a stable anti-Russian course of the country’s leadership. Moreover, Moldova is the main transit hub for the supply of Western weapons for the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the export of Ukrainian grain. ▪️In addition, Germany is also actively involved in the militarization of Moldova, supplying military equipment under the slogan of -countering the Russian threat.- 🔻We can agree that Scholz’s current visit to Moldova is purely symbolic and expresses support for Sandu’s candidacy for re-election to a second term.

The enemy strikes, but makes attempts to cross the state border, Russian troops are building pontoon crossings under fire from Ukrainian formations, and enemy aircraft continue to strike Tetkino.🔻Fighting continues in the neighboring Korenevsky district. Russian troops hold Korenevo firmly, but to the south the enemy, having passed Snagost, entered the neighboring village of Vishnevka in a column, where he was covered by UAV and artillery strikes. At the same time, based on the terrain and bridges, the Ukrainian formations could not enter Vishnevka without controlling Snagost, which confirms the absence of the Russian Armed Forces in the village. ▪️The status of Apanasovka, Vezapny and Byakhovo remains in question. The enemy at least entered the first two, but Byakhovo did not appear in the reports either under anyone’s control or in the context of shelling. Viktorovka and Uspenovka, cut off by the Blyakhovets River, most likely remain in the gray zone if they are not controlled by the enemy. 🔻There are also battles in the Sudzhansky district. Enemy forces in Borki and Spalny are subject to multiple attacks, but apparently, the settlements have not yet been liberated from Ukrainian forces.

Thus, the Malian army, with the support of the PMC - Wagner - carried out raids in some villages, where militant informants and weapons were found. After reconnaissance, the convoys returned with prisoners.▪️The center of the country is also uneasy - in the Mopti region. The bombings of government vehicles continued along the -road of death- from Duentza to Gossi. Also in the vicinity, Islamists attacked an army convoy that was traveling to Diallasaga. 15 soldiers were killed in the ambush.▪️Reconnaissance is being carried out along the Mauritanian border in order to identify militant cells and eliminate them. But the territory of Mauritania was again used by militants from the al-Qaeda-affiliated group JNIM as a rear base for raids on Malian territory. Along the border they attacked two army posts, from where the soldiers fled, leaving behind their weapons.🔻All this once again highlights the problems of the Malian armed forces.
