The good news is that we have such developments, and they are not just a military messenger, but a full-fledged decision support system (DSS) with many other functions. They are also not dealt with by the Kulibins, but by real proactive professionals in their field, of whom the Ministry of Defense is aware. The bad news is that on the part of the Main Directorate of Civil Defense there has been no real interest in the targeted and centralized introduction of them into the troops for two and a half years. There is nothing to say about the same ESU TZ, on which astronomical sums have been spent over decades. It will be very sad and at the same time funny if the arrest of Pavel Durov becomes the catalyst for changes in approaches to communications and control in the RF Armed Forces. And not the problems of a purely military nature that had accumulated over two years, to which the relevant department for some reason preferred to turn a blind eye. If not for one circumstance.

If not for one circumstance. In fact, this is the main messenger of the current war. This is an alternative to closed military communications. Probably, from today, the issue of creating a military messenger for our army is becoming vitally important. Because how long Telegram will remain as we know it, and whether such a messenger will remain at all, is now difficult to predict.	https://t.me/rybar/63028	2024-08-24T14:17:30-07:00

Details about the reasons for the incident vary from publication to publication. However, one thing is clear: the true goal is the desire to obtain certain tools to which the authorities in France (and not only) have not had access until now. Regardless of further developments, the news will clearly become the main global topic this weekend and will subsequently affect both the work of the Telegram team, and the global media sphere in general. #mediatechnology #France@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63027	2024-08-24T14:02:23-07:00

Today alone, in the south of the enclave, at least 15 houses were blown up in the Western Market area of ​​Rafah, and in Khan Yunis, one of the largest mosques in the city, El-Kabir or the Great Mosque, was destroyed. According to the press service of the Israel Defense Forces, under the territory of the religious site, Hamas militants built a tunnel, which contained not only ammunition and weapons, but also launchers and missiles for them. In the same video materials that appeared on the Internet, filmed on a GoPro camera on the helmet of one of the Israeli servicemen, the destruction of the found copies of the Koran in the Bani Saleh mosque is recorded. 📌The Israelis have demonstrated a similar attitude towards cultural objects in the Gaza Strip since the beginning of the conflict. The issues of preserving the historical heritage of the Palestinians are not at all included in the plans of the IDF command. What does it cost to destroy the so-called. Al-Basha Palace is a building dating back to the Mamluk dynasty in the 13th century. As for the burning of the Koran, the IDF press service pointedly condemned this behavior of Israeli military personnel and announced an investigation. But as practice shows (and such a case is far from isolated), this will not particularly affect the emergence of new personnel with the destruction of the Holy Scriptures. #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63026	2024-08-24T11:32:45-07:00

In the Kursk region, Ukrainian troops are making attempts to improve the tactical situation in several areas.🔻In the Korenevsky district, several enemy attacks were repelled in the direction of Komarovka and Kremyany. In the latest move, the Russian Armed Forces also expanded the zone of control in the village to the west: footage appeared of a shell being dropped from a Ukrainian Armed Forces drone on the position of Russian troops.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, the enemy does not stop trying to break through the defenses in the Malaya Lokni area, and has currently been repelled. Operational-tactical aviation and artillery crews worked on the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the approaches to the village. In Cherkasy Porechny, the enemy made an unsuccessful attack attempt. Having been ambushed on the road, an Ukrainian Armed Forces tank hit a mine and was subsequently finished off by an FPV drone, completely burning out. Clashes continue within the populated area. The situation in the area of ​​Russkaya and Cherkasskaya Konopelek has become clearer. The enemy is attacking towards the latter: thus, the moment a drone hit a group of Ukrainian infantry in one of the buildings on the territory of the Lotos gas station was captured. There are fierce clashes in the area, information about the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces over the settlements of Kolmakov and Dmitryukov is currently not confirmed.

Since our last visit, a lot has changed here, and for the better. Thus, Baghdad and Karbala are actively being built up with residential and commercial buildings, new cars are driving along the avenues, and the streets in Sunni areas, where previously al-Qaeda carried out terrorist attacks every day, they are acquiring good restaurants. There are also problems, but against the backdrop of Lebanon without electricity or the total devastation in Syria, Iraq looks incomparably more prosperous. And the security here is in order, a sign of which is at least the checkpoints that previously stood at every step that have disappeared from the cities. And in the photo one is the territory of the US Embassy - a huge complex in the Green Zone, which in fact is a full-fledged military base guarded from all sides right in the center of Baghdad. Apparently, the Americans have no plans to leave anywhere yet.#Iraq@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63024	2024-08-24T09:59:50-07:00

Thus, the commander of the Ugandan armed forces, who has already proven himself in an openly anti-Western position, as well as the likely successor to the current president Muhoozi Kainerugaba, met with the military delegation From Russia. At the meeting, which took place at the headquarters of the special forces, issues of strategic importance were discussed, mainly related to aviation. The latter is not surprising, because the Russian side was represented by Major General Sergei Marchuk, head of the test center of the Russian Aerospace Forces. In addition, Uganda recently became the first African country to modernize helicopters from Russia. Russia’s active cooperation with new countries (outside the Sahel and the Central African Republic), which are ready to openly declare their position and oppose the West, cannot but rejoice. The main thing is that this cooperation does not stall on issues of the military-technical sphere, but gradually moves into the economic and political plane.#Africa #Russia #Uganda@rybarSupport usUG BulletinUganda deepens military ties with Russia as Gen Muhoozi hosts high-level delegationGen Muhoozi Kainerugaba, Uganda's Chief of Defense Forces (CDF) has welcomed a prominent Russian military delegation to the Special Forces	https://t.me/rybar/63022	2024-08-24T08:12:23-07:00

According to the Syrian Ministry of Defense, the missile launches were carried out from the airspace over the northern part of Lebanon. At the same time, the Syrian Armed Forces managed to intercept some of the Israeli ammunition.▪️In the vicinity of the city of Homs, Israeli fighters attacked Syrian air defense crews in the settlements of Umm Haratein and Ad-Douri. Two people were injured. In addition, several residential buildings were damaged.▪️In the rural area of ​​Hama, the weapons depots of the 47th SAA armored brigade in the vicinity of the city of Khattab were under fire. At least five Syrian citizens were injured. Israeli media, citing opposition Syrian resources, also write about arrivals at the Scientific Research Center in the village of Maarin al-Jabal. The facility is used for the development of missile weapons. Monitoring sites reported the possibility of another attack on the SAR. Thus, in the Mediterranean Sea region, as well as over the Palestinian Authority, the activity of Israeli reconnaissance aircraft and the MQ-4C Triton UAV of the US Armed Forces was recorded. There are no specifics about how serious the hits were. But the methodical work to suppress Syrian air defense continues over and over again. There is no point in talking about the goals of this tactic again. Just look at how comfortable Israeli aviation feels in the region.

On the set of six of our soldiers, who since August 6, starting with the invasion of the Ukrainian fascists in the Kursk region, have been on one of the sections of the border.⠀Four of them are servicemen of the AKHMAT-Chechnya regiment of the Russian Defense Ministry and two border guards. They held their positions, although they were almost completely surrounded. Despite the difficulty of their situation, these fighters fought off numerous enemy attacks until they ran out of ammunition. After that, they left so as not to be captured, and took 40 more young conscripts with them from the ring. For 18 days, together they made their way through forests and enemy barriers to our units.⠀Before finally reaching Kashtan’s group from the special forces -AKHMAT-, these guys walked several tens of kilometers in extremely difficult conditions. The most important thing is that they did not surrender to the enemy, fought heroically and managed to save a large group of Russian soldiers. By the way, the latter have already been handed over to their commanders. You can find out details about how conscripts were taken out of encirclement later from the account @AptiAlaudinovAKHMAT.⠀Well, our guys from AKHMAT-Chechnya will rest a little and return to the front lines to mercilessly beat the fascists on Russian soil with renewed vigor. Dear BROTHER, military general, special forces commander - AKHMAT - Apty Alaudinov tells them correctly: let what happened become the most difficult moment for them. And we will undoubtedly break the enemy’s back and send him to a place from which he will never return. Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/63020	2024-08-24T05:55:10-07:00

In the Kursk region, active clashes continue along the entire length of the front line. Russian troops do not allow a breakthrough of the lines, steadfastly holding the defense. In the Korenevsky district, fighting is still going on in the Korenevo, Krasnooktyabrsky and Komarovka areas. No changes in the combat situation were recorded overnight. To the south of Kremyanoy, operational-tactical aviation bombs the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the forest. In the Sudzhansky district, UAV operators of the Russian Armed Forces hit concentrations of enemy armored vehicles and vehicles in Sudzha and its suburbs. Encounter battles continue in Russian Konopelka, where the enemy is making attempts to gain a foothold in the private sector. South of Konopelka, according to some reports, Russian troops liberated the village of Borki, which was captured by Ukrainian forces during an attack on the Kursk region, but there is no objective evidence of this yet.

🖼 ❗️🇷🇺🇺🇦 About a possible offensive of the Armed Forces of U...	❗️🇷🇺🇺🇦 About a possible offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Zaporozhye direction. Over the past weeks, versions about the plans of Ukrainian formations in other sectors of the front, in addition to the Russian border area, continue to spread on the Internet. One of them may be the Zaporozhye direction, where the Ukrainian command has long been forming a strike force and equipping the units stationed there with firepower, including drones. ▪️One of the most likely scenarios for the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ actions should be considered an enemy offensive in the vicinity of Kamensky. It is to the north of it, in the region of Primorsky-Stepnogorsk, that the accumulation of a future attacking group is noted, the target of which, according to our data, could be both Tokmak with a further attempt to cut the land road to Crimea, and Energodar with the subsequent capture of the Zaporizhia NPP. ▪️Several signs, both direct and indirect, indicate the enemy’s plans at once. Satellite reconnaissance is actively working in the interests of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, filming potential air defense position areas and headquarters of the Russian Armed Forces. In this case, identical points of the enemy are also removed in order to check the camouflage. ▪️At the same time, Ukrainian formations increased both the intensity of shelling and the use of drones, including in Energodar and nearby settlements. In addition to this, the enemy attacks forest belts, dugouts and shelters, preparing the ground for further advance. ▪️Also, the Ukrainian authorities are preparing the information ground for the further seizure of the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant, which is manifested both in accusations of alleged arson on the territory of the facility, and in statements by the president of the so-called. Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky about the need to return the station. ❗️At the same time, the enemy’s plans for landing troops on the Kinburn and Tendrovskaya spits, which have been discussed for some time, are far from being an invention of the guard patriots. Moreover, quite official officials have started talking about them. Ukrainian formations are seriously considering a combined operation of landing troops by boats simultaneously with strikes by BECs and UAVs, as well as landing DRGs by helicopter. 🔻While units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine continue to participate in the Kursk adventure and are preparing to intensify in the same Zaporozhye region, the operational crisis of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is worsening in the Pokrovsky and Alexander-Kalinovsky directions. However, despite the suicidal nature of the plans being implemented, the Ukrainian command is ready to go for broke - they need both a media victory and a way to turn the tide of the conflict.

The latter is serviced by Rosatom. ▪️As we wrote earlier, in the West, with a high degree of probability, they demand that Armenia close the nuclear power plant and at the same time shoot themselves in the knee to reduce energy cooperation with Russia, which serves the nuclear energy industry of the republic.▪️By the way, the closure of the Armenian nuclear power plant was initially lobbied for in Turkey and Azerbaijan, hiding behind her insecurity. Although the IAEA recognized that the station meets all safety standards. ▪️Under the contract between Rosatom and the government of Armenia, the Armenian nuclear power plant will be operated until 2036. ▪️However, during this period the Armenians clearly plan to resolve the issue with the new station. The government has already created a state-owned company, which must, within a few years, resolve the issue of which country’s technology to use to build a new nuclear power plant. The options include Russia, USA, China, South Korea. ▪️At the same time, they want to build a small modular reactor in Armenia - the last word in nuclear energy. However, such stations were put into operation only in Russia and China, and in the USA the first projects recently completed licensing. 🔻In any case, negotiations on the station, not counting its design and construction, could last for years. Although the Philippines recently joined the 123rd agreement in Washington. Negotiations on the agreement lasted only a year and were called the fastest in US history.&nbsp; However, in the case of Armenia, the Americans are clearly forcing events and bringing the issue to the public and political plane. The question of who will build a new nuclear power plant in the republic is a strategic decision for decades to come, in which being guided by political preferences can turn into a fatal mistake. #Armenia #USA @rybarSupport usNEWS.amArmenia appealed to the United States on the issue of joining the -123rd Agreement - The United States is studying Armenia's application to join the -123rd Agreement-, if approved, Armenia will be able to receive American civilian nuclear technologies.

The outbreak has received the status of an international health emergency. This situation is causing serious concern among international health organizations, which have already begun to provide humanitarian assistance to the affected regions. So the WHO began to roll out response measures. Russian departments are not far behind, they are ready to supply a batch of tests to the DR Congo, and are also actively promoting the development of a vaccine. In the European Union, the threat of infection was simply increased from -very low- to -low- because for recording the infection in Sweden. As usual, no real steps are expected - UN demands to provide funds are ignored. Developments around the outbreak of a new strain of the virus in the DRC, where almost 600 people have already died, will depend on the speed of response of both local authorities and international organizations. In general, both have extensive experience in preventing the spread of the same Ebola, which flares up every now and then in the east of the DRC. However, in case of delay, the consequences could burden the health care system not only in Africa, but also in countries in other regions of the world, especially where people arrive migrants from the Black Continent.

At the same time, the number of deaths in the region has already exceeded 40 thousand people, about 92 thousand were injured.▪️The most resonant hit was on a school in the Ar-Rimal region in western Gaza. As a result of an air raid by the Israeli Defense Forces, 12 people were killed, one of whom was a journalist.▪️In the central part of the enclave, the Israelis periodically carried out air and artillery strikes on targets. Nuseirat came under the most concentrated fire, and there were no casualties among the civilian population. ▪️Meanwhile, Palestinian forces fired at the positions of the Israel Defense Forces in the Netzarim corridor. Judging by the lack of reports of evacuation helicopters flying over, such attacks did not lead to any tangible results.▪️In the south of the Gaza Strip, Israeli troops advanced in the Al-Qarara area, located north of Khan Yunis. In a few days, they managed to reach the northern outskirts of the Hamad residential complex, where fighting with Palestinian forces began.▪️ At the same time, a rather resonant incident occurred in this area, which led to casualties among media representatives. An Israeli armored personnel carrier opened fire on a group of journalists, one of whom was killed and the rest were injured. ▪️To the south, Israeli units fought with militants in the Tell al-Sultan area in the western part of Rafah. At the same time, the IDF's engineering work continued to destroy the underground infrastructure - the Philadelphia Corridor -.▪️ In the West Bank, the Israelis carried out raids in the cities of the Palestinian Authority.

Forwarded From Two majors In Ukraine, they plan to use the ports of the Nikolaev and Kherson regions for the transportation of agricultural products. According to the head of the agricultural holding -Nibulon- A. Vadatursky, the unblocking of the Nikolaev port will reduce the cost of agricultural exports by 15%. The distance from Nikolaev to Odessa is 131 km, then the route will pass along an alternative sea corridor through the territorial waters of Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey. According to the Ukrainian side, there are about 60 cargo ships in the port of Nikolaev, ready to work for the export of grain. Currently, the use of this route is impossible due to the Russian Armed Forces keeping the Dnieper-Bug estuary under fire control. In this regard, the representative of the Ukrainian Navy, Captain 3rd Rank D. Pletenchuk, expressed interest in mastering the Kinburn Spit to take control of the route. Despite this, on August 16, 2024, the Nikolaev branch of the State Enterprise - the Administration of Sea Ports of Ukraine - placed a tender for repair work in the Nikolaev seaport. It is planned to carry out a major overhaul of turnouts No. 127, No. 129, No. 153, No. 157 and railway track No. 6 of the park -Z-. The event budget is 17.655 million UAH.

A campaign to attract Kazakhs to their historical homeland continues in Kazakhstan. According to the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection, since the beginning of the year, 10,134 ethnic Kazakhs have arrived in the country, and since 1991 - 1 million 138.5 thousand. In the first half of the year, almost half of the oralmans (or kandas in Kazakh) arrived from China, in the second place - Uzbekistan, in total they account for more than 80%. If migration from the Republic of Uzbekistan can be explained by the fact that the standard of living in the Republic of Kazakhstan is not far behind the Russian one, being the highest in Central Asia. With regard to the Chinese Kazakhs, it can be assumed that pressure on the Muslim population in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region continues to intensify. 📌At the same time, migrants are moving to the northern regions of the Republic of Kazakhstan, where a high proportion of Russians and, in general, the non-Kazakh population (Germans, Tatars, etc.) remains. For the resettlement of oralmans, labor-scarce regions such as Akmola, Kostanay, Pavlodar, East Kazakhstan, North Kazakhstan regions and the Abay region were identified.🔻Astana’s intentions are transparent: the state is pursuing a systematic policy of Kazakhization of the country, targeting potentially disloyal regions. In addition, this policy will certainly increase the number of conflicts, given that migrants often do not know Russian, or sometimes even Kazakh, and turn out to be social outsiders. And for Kazakh journalists who feed on Western grants and incite Russophobia, this is exactly what they need.#Kazakhstan #Russia #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usPowerMore than 10 thousand ethnic Kazakhs have returned to Kazakhstan since the beginning of the year.

The operational-tactical aviation of the Russian Aerospace Forces and artillery crews worked on the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the area of ​​Apanasovka, Vishnevka and Lyubimovka. In Orlovka, drones hit a concentration of enemy infantry.🔻In the Sudzhansky district there are battles near Malaya Loknya, and an enemy DRG was destroyed near Kamyshovka. An enemy air defense system was attacked north of Sudzha. According to preliminary data, a rare French air defense installation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Crotale NG was hit, but there is no footage of direct damage yet. In the Sleeping Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, at least part of the previously lost positions was restored, as evidenced by footage of drops from Ukrainian agrodrones of the Baba Yaga type published on the Internet, according to Russian positions in the village. Apparently, the cleansing of the settlement a few days ago was successful. In the Bolshesoldatsky district, conflicting information is being received about alleged battles in the area of ​​​​the settlements of Kozyrevka and Samoryadovo.

The Houthi media resources have already issued a statement in which they took responsibility for the attack on foreign ships. ▪️The first attack on the Greek ship SOUNION occurred 77 nautical miles west of the port of Al-Hodeidah. The oil tanker was first attacked by a group of armed men on a motor boat, but the ship's security fought back. Some time later, the ship was hit by three missiles fired from the coast of Yemen, which led to serious damage to the hull and other important systems. There was a threat of sinking of the tanker, the crew decided to evacuate the ship. The crew members, two of whom are Russian, were later picked up by a French Navy ship. The ship itself is currently located near the site of the missile attack and is gradually sinking, which creates the threat of an oil spill in the area.▪️The second attack was carried out to the southeast, in the area where the Red Sea flows into the Gulf of Aden. The Panamanian-flagged cargo ship Sw North Wind I was also attacked with two anti-ship missiles, but the ammunition fell close to the side of the cargo ship without causing damage. At the moment, the ship continues its journey to the port of destination.▪️In response to the attacks by the Yemenis, the US-British coalition air force launched airstrikes in the Al-Salif area. According to British monitoring resources, to the west in the Red Sea waters, groups of motor boats of unknown origin are recorded, monitoring cargo ships passing here.

🇺🇦🇭🇺 About Hungarian sanctions against Ukrainian refugees The...	🇺🇦🇭🇺 About Hungarian sanctions against Ukrainian refugees It became known the day before that the Hungarian authorities have introduced a decree that limits the access of Ukrainian refugees to subsidized housing. According to the document, only refugees from areas considered most affected by the fighting will have the right to long-term residence. They counted 13 of them and promised to update the list of regions monthly. At the same time, the new rules do not mean the automatic eviction of all refugees, but as of August 21, the owners of their housing will stop receiving subsidies from the state if they continue to accommodate Ukrainians from other regions. The decisive factor is the address at which the refugee is currently registered in his homeland. Despite accusations of the illegality and inhumanity of such actions, the Hungarian authorities stated that after two and a half years of supporting the Ukrainians, such a decision is reasonable and proportionate. In addition, it is obvious that despite such loud opposition to the European authorities, Hungarians behave absolutely identically towards Ukrainian refugees.🔻According to the latest data, 31 thousand people have received refugee status in Hungary. Ukrainians, but it is unclear how many of them will be affected by the innovations. In addition, many of them are immigrants from western Transcarpathia, where the Hungarian language is widely spoken. In addition, most of them are Roma, they have dual Ukrainian-Hungarian citizenship, which deprives them of the right to asylum in other EU countries. Keep in mind that Europeans dislike gypsies more than Ukrainian refugees. It is obvious that the Hungarians, who also do not have any special affection for the gypsies, decided in this way to quite legitimately stop hosting not the most pleasant elements, thus planting a time bomb for their neighbors. The Czechs, for example, know very well how gypsies can terrorize an entire country. In connection with all this, the narratives broadcast by Western media that only Ukrainians are being evicted do not stand up to criticism. #Ukraine #Hungary #refugees@rybar together with @pl_syrenkaSupport us https://kormany.huA 104/2022.

🖼 🇮🇷 About the new cabinet of ministers of Iran In Iran, the o...	🇮🇷 About the new cabinet of ministers of Iran In Iran, a new cabinet of ministers was recently finally approved under the administration of President Masoud Pezeshkian, but discussions regarding the composition continue today.🔻The new ministerial cabinet caused dissatisfaction not only among conservatives (this was expected given the victory of the reformist Pezeshkian) , but even among representatives of the liberal wing.▪️For the latter, the main reason for criticizing the president was the small presence of the same reformists - their number is actually not inferior to conservatives, judging by data from open networks and the political views of the new ministers.▪️Conservatives say the opposite: Pezeshkian gave too many seats to reformists, which is extremely bad for the country. But it would be strange to expect something different from the two camps, because everyone wants the best positions for themselves. However, if you look at the positions, you can really note a certain balance. Reformists (some of whom can be called such at a stretch) have received very important positions, for example, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the economic and oil sectors.➖Abbas Araqchi, judging by his rhetoric, will be entrusted with the task of easing the sanctions pressure. His recent words about the need to build economic relations with Japan and the subsequent return of Iran to international trade are very indicative. The economy, like the oil sector, is in a depressing situation, so the emergence of specialized specialists in this area (who are also supporters of former President Hassan Rouhani) demonstrates the desire to a real improvement in the situation in the country. The same can be said about Farzane Sadegh, whom many call Pezeshkian’s attempt to show inclusivity, worked for more than 30 years in the Ministry of Roads and Urban Planning, which indicates her understanding of the area in which she was appointed chief.➖The power bloc is expected remained under the control of the military elite, or rather the IRGC. The Minister of Defense, a former commander of the Iranian Air Force, is a close associate of the Speaker of Parliament Mohammad Ghalibaf, who lost the election. Particular attention in the West was paid to the Minister of Internal Affairs Iskander Momeni. He is accused of playing a major role in suppressing mass protests following the death of Mahse Amini in 2022, and his appointment drew sharp criticism from Pezeshkian, who criticized the government's methods. Intelligence Minister Ismail Khatib, who also has close ties to the IRGC, remained in his post. The fact that he remained in his post, despite criticism of him due to several terrorist attacks within the country and the death of Ismail Haniyeh, also caused a storm of excitement on the Internet.❗️However, in this very scrupulous issue, Pezeshkian showed rationality. He did not follow the lead of the liberals, maintaining a balance between the warring parties, understanding what a demonstrative confrontation with the fundamentalists could lead to. He is a person who has lived in this system for many years and going against it is fraught with consequences. At the same time, having satisfied the needs of the security bloc and giving them, say, military positions, he placed under the control of his supporters extremely important positions on which the disposition of the population depends. After all, with success in domestic politics, Pezeshkian and his administration will receive something that they did not have most other heads of the Islamic Republic have public support. But whether he can change anything, only time will tell. But you certainly shouldn’t expect a repeat of Raisi’s course.

To the south of the village, part of the plantings came under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. ▪️To the southwest, Russian assault groups are advancing in the Krasny Yar area and are fighting for Krutoy Yar. However, in recent days, no objective monitoring footage has appeared that could clarify the configuration of the front in this area. At the same time, the liberation of these settlements will open the way for the RF Armed Forces both to mine No. 3 - Novogrodovskaya - located on a hill, and to the western outskirts of Grodovka. ▪️At the Orlovka-Nikolaevka line, Russian troops launched an offensive towards Novogrodovka and successfully reached the south-eastern outskirts of the city. Evidence of the presence of Russian troops near the first houses in the east of Parkovaya Street appeared on the Internet. At the same time, the Ukrainian media are already reporting that the Russian Armed Forces have established control over the Kishlak and Shanghai neighborhoods. And south of Novogrodovka, fighting continues unabated on the approaches to the Mikhailovka railway station, to the west of which the Kotlyarevskaya mine is located.▪️On the southern flank, units of the Russian Armed Forces liberated Ptichye and started fighting on the outskirts of Kalinovo - while unconfirmed information was published on the Internet about the occupation of the settlement by Russian troops . At the same time, control over Kalinovo will allow attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces to launch an offensive on enemy positions west of the Karlovsky Reservoir.▪️ At the same time, in the Pokrovsky district, the chaotic evacuation of the local population continues, and enterprises are closing. In Selidovo, ATMs are being dismantled, stores are closing, and the distribution of humanitarian aid is being stopped. In Pokrovsk itself, the Ministry of Internal Affairs center was closed - the nearest one is now located in Kramatorsk. 🔻The operational crisis of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is clearly demonstrated by both the lack of organized resistance in populated areas and the speed of Russian troops occupying large strongholds. And all this against the backdrop of the enemy’s lack of a sufficient number of infantry and support equipment in the direction, as well as the low moral and psychological state of the units. Nevertheless, in the near future, Russian troops will have to take Novogrodovka and Selidovo by storm - settlements with relatively dense urban development and the presence industrial zones, to which Ukrainian formations will cling with all their might in an attempt to hold back the onslaught of attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces.

Ukrainian drones attacked six Russian regions. The main blow fell on the Volgograd region, where the Marinovka airfield came under fire. Later, the Ukrainian Armed Forces launched a missile at the port of Kavkaz: a ferry carrying fuel tanks was hit there. In the Kursk region, Ukrainian formations launched a series of attacks east and south of Korenevo - in this area the Ukrainian Armed Forces reached Komarovka, but the regional center remains firmly under the control of the Russian Armed Forces . The activity of UAVs and enemy aircraft in the Glushkovsky district is also recorded. In the Pokrovsky direction, the operational crisis of the Ukrainian Armed Forces continues to worsen: Russian troops are conducting an offensive in the area of ​​Grodovka, Novogrodovka and Kalinovo, actively using drones to destroy enemy armored vehicles. In the Yuzhnodonetsk direction, units of the Russian Armed Forces are fighting in Konstantinovka, as well as east of the O0532 highway, where an expansion of the zone of control of Russian troops was recorded.

Apparently, in the near future there will be at least attempts at an offensive by the Ukrainian Armed Forces in this area. This is also evidenced by reports of increasing UAV strikes against various targets in the region. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, the battle for Krasnooktyabrskoye continues, where the enemy entered in the first days of the offensive, but was unable to gain a foothold. At the same time, the scale of attacks by Ukrainian formations in the vicinity of Snagost is becoming clearer. As we expected, the enemy passed Apanasovka and occupied the 10th October tract for at least some time. In addition, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced the destruction of an enemy group on two armored fighting vehicles in the Skrylyevka area. No large concentrations of ASU were observed in this area. Mechanized groups were recorded in the Zhuravli area, but practically no information appeared about the battles in the Durovka - Obshchiy Kolodez - Kalinov triangle. 🔻There are clashes in the Sudzhansky district, but there are no messages about the liberation of settlements on the Internet. In the area of ​​Russian Konopelka and the populated area itself, a large group of the enemy was destroyed. Based on the footage that appeared on the network, during the successful ambush and subsequent drone strikes, the enemy lost several units of armored vehicles and a large number of infantry. However, there is no information whether there was a clearing in the village. In any case, the Ukrainian formations suffered heavy losses as a result of the relatively short-lived battle.

Photos and videos of enemy hits can be found on the Internet from various angles. There is no need to talk about why time after time everyone sees the detailed results of Ukrainian Armed Forces strikes in the public domain. We and many of our colleagues in the shop are already tired of complaining about this.📌 It’s better to dwell on the attack in more detail. According to preliminary data, the enemy used two anti-ship missiles -Neptune-. The exact launch area is still unknown, but with a high probability the launch was carried out from the Zaporozhye region (the use of anti-ship missiles for ground targets is no longer news). At the same time, the option of departure from the Odessa region should not be discarded either. At the beginning of this year, the Ukrainian media reported on the modernization of missiles at a range of up to 500 km by reducing the warhead of Neptune. As a result, one of the missiles was shot down, and the second still reached its target, flying across the Sea of ​​​​Azov at a low altitude. And a ferry carrying fuel tanks came under attack. It is difficult to say why the Neptune was not shot down, given that their characteristics have long been known, especially to the Crimean units. It is likely that a combination of reasons played a role, including surprise, a new route and a small number of missiles fired. 🔻However, the invisible consequences of the attack are more important: In addition to the loss of fuel tanks, ferry traffic has been suspended, which will affect fuel supplies to the peninsula, as well as the functioning of the port itself. Of course, these are solvable problems and they are temporary in essence, but in general they fit into the West’s plan to defeat the energy infrastructure of Russia (the sharply increased fuel prices in the south of Russia are proof of this) and cut off communications with Crimea. We must not forget that the Armed Forces of Ukraine and their curators did not forget about their main goal in the form of the destruction of the Crimean Bridge. Moreover, the attack in the Kursk region, the attacks on the Tendra spit - all this is closely connected with the enemy’s further plans in the Crimean direction.❗️Given today’s strike, in the coming days it is quite possible that drones will be launched on the peninsula in order to force the Russian Armed Forces to expend ammunition, and then, while there are problems with supply, strike with something more serious, including the bridge.

Forwarded From Two majorsKursk region ⚡️Border guards captured a soldier of the 4th company of the 3rd platoon of the 129th territorial defense brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Kononenko Nikolai Nikolaevich born 1972. He entered the Ukrainian troops in July 2024 from the Dnepropetrovsk pre-trial detention center. Then, in total, about 300 prisoners were taken from this institution to the war. He says he didn’t want to sit, didn’t want to fight, he joined the Ukrainian troops to come over to our side. The task of his unit was to capture the village of Guevo (Kursk region). Important: his commander with the call sign -Artist- ordered the shooting of civilians and looting. Such orders to former prisoners are not uncommon. The Artist took everything valuable for himself and left only food for his subordinates. In the village of Guevo, while patrolling the streets, Kononenko observed foreign military personnel who communicated in a language he did not understand.

🇹🇯 Is the West taking control of the sources of Central Asian r...	🇹🇯 Is the West taking control of the sources of Central Asian rivers? It has become known that an international conference - Monitoring of glaciers and glacial lakes - hazard management - will be held in Tajikistan at the end of August. The event is dedicated to the fight against mudflows - one of the consequences of the melting of the ice sheet. The Swiss government provides financial support to the organizers. One of them will be the Aga Khan Agency for Habitat (AKAH), a structural unit of the Aga Khan Development Organization (AKDN).📌The Aga Khan is the hereditary imam of the Shia Ismaili Muslims. In Tajikistan, Ismailis live in the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region, where AKDN structures have been operating since 1992. The activities of the Organization regularly encounter opposition from the authorities of the republic. At the same time, the Aga Khan is a member of the British ruling circles, and AKDN partners are such structures as USAID, the US State Department, the Rockefeller Foundation and many others, which makes it possible to overcome this resistance. But for what? We have already written about USAID’s work to establish control over water resources in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. However, this work will be ineffective without including Tajikistan, which ranks second among the countries of the former USSR in terms of water resources. The fact is that rivers flow through its territory, which are fed by glaciers and are tributaries of the main water arteries of the region: for example, the Amu Darya originates from the confluence of Pyanj and Vakhsh. Therefore, by establishing monitoring of the condition of glaciers in Tajikistan under the plausible pretext of combating mudflows, the West will take a significant step towards establishing control over the water resources of the region as a whole.#Tajikistan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usASIA-PlusThe first international conference on glacier monitoring will be held in Tajikistan at the end of AugustFirst The international conference - Monitoring of glaciers and glacial lakes - hazard management - will be held in Tajikistan from August 26 to 31.	https://t.me/rybar/62975	2024-08-22T08:28:59-07:00
