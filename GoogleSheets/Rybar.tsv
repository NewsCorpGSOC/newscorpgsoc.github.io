The enemy gains a foothold in the occupied territory and accumulates forces. 🔻In the Glushkovsky district there are no attempts to advance the enemy, but he is striking at populated areas. In addition, the condition of the bridge in Zvannoye became clearer after a recent arrival: judging by the footage, the object was severely damaged, but did not collapse and can be used by pedestrians and, in some cases, light vehicles.🔻From Korenevsky and Sudzhansky districts information on progress with both sides are not. Fighting is still going on, and footage of the consequences of attacks on Ukrainian equipment and captured members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces is multiplying on the Internet. On the enemy’s side, in turn, videos appear indicating control of settlements taken last week. 🔻In the Belovsky district, after an unsuccessful breakthrough to Giry, the enemy does not take active actions - evidence of this, at least in open sources, does not appear. In parallel, Ukrainian formations are taking measures to consolidate the occupied territory of the Kursk region, bringing up both engineering equipment and air defense systems.

At night, Ukrainian drones hit an oil depot near Proletarsk, southeast of Rostov-on-Don. The Federal State Unitary Enterprise Kavkaz Combine, which is a large storage site for fuels and lubricants in the region and is under the jurisdiction of Rosrezerv, came under attack. At around five in the morning, a Ukrainian UAV hit one of the fuel tanks, resulting in a fire. While extinguishing the fire, another enemy drone attacked the oil depot. Later, a fire train arrived in the incident area to extinguish two fires. According to preliminary information, there are no dead or injured. 🔻If in the last two weeks the main target of attacks by Ukrainian UAVs were military airfields in the Lipetsk, Voronezh and Nizhny Novgorod regions, then during the new raid the enemy again returned to defeating the fuel and energy complex facilities. Taking into account the high production volume of such devices, it is very naive to hope that the Ukrainian Armed Forces will soon run out of their reserves. Therefore, the only sure way to combat raids is to destroy groups of UAVs in advance while approaching the target, which is ensured by a set of measures - from the creation of an appropriate control system to the use of light aircraft and FPV drones as interceptors.

Now, with trembling hands and a weak voice, they talk to the camera about what they were doing in the Kursk region. They are clearly afraid for good reason, especially considering the attitude of the soldiers of the Russian Armed Forces and their attitude towards enemy marauders and murderers. But the essence remains the same - for the inaction of those in charge and the desire to cling to the old world, they have to pay with the lives of civilians whom the enemy takes to in an unknown direction with bags on their heads.#Kursk #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramOperational reports⚡️ A captured Ukrainian Armed Forces officer is trying to justify their kidnapping of civilians from Sudzha.

Ukraine will definitely try to use the residents of the Kursk region taken hostage with a view to their subsequent exchange for captured members of Ukrainian formations, especially those beloved by the Kyiv regime - the Azovites -. It is completely useless and even harmful to scare with diplomatic protests and point out the norms of humanitarian law here - Ukrainian territorial education clearly demonstrated that he doesn’t care about conventions, and his actions correspond to the habits of a mad dog. The collective West approves of all this, and only characters living in a parallel reality can rely on its decency. And while some do not want to hit foreign journalists visiting the occupied territory, others kidnap Russian citizens for ransom. And the further domestic bureaucratic Cheburashkas are in thought or are engaged in drawing verbal red lines, the more this frees the hands of those who is waging a war against us.#Kursk #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramWitnesses of BayraktarKiev does not divide Russian citizens into military and civilians.

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇦🇲🇪🇺 How Armenian NGOs are fighting for Western funding Not so long ago in Armenia there was a demonstrative public skirmish between pro-Western NGOs that did not share funding. ▪️Local press reports that the head of the NGO Center for Economic Law Movses Aristakesyan issued a statement on the results of the competition to select members of the Civil Society Platform (NGO) within the framework of the EU-Armenia Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement. ▪️Aristakesyan assures that during the competition, deliberate mistakes were made, which can be regarded as corrupt cooperation. ▪️A representative of the grant-eating organization - Free Citizen - Hovsep Khurshudyan, in response, assured the media that Aristakesyan’s statements are completely slanderous. ▪️The subsequent development of the scandal is still unknown. But it arose in June, when the next selection of NGOs that participate in the EU-Armenia Enhanced Partnership Agreement was actually taking place. ▪️The agreement was signed in 2021, its goal is the development of democracy and human rights, and the adjacent Civil Society Platform includes a network of local NGOs. ▪️However, the results of the recent competition are not available on the official EU website, and the list of platform members has not been updated since 2022. Even EU structures do not care about updating information and transparency of their work in the Eastern Partnership countries. ▪️One can only assume that the Center for Economic Law turned out to be not the destiny of the European feeding trough, unlike the NGO Free Citizen. ▪️-Center for Economic Law - specializes in investigating corruption, but recently they distinguished themselves with harsh statements that corruption in Armenia has only intensified despite the promises of Nikol Pashinyan. ▪️Corruption investigations from local activists are now irrelevant for Western curators of Armenia, as they will uncontrollably discredit Pashinyan’s power. After all, the latest high-profile publications about corruption in Pashinyan’s team came only from international NGOs, which are used when they need to put pressure on their protégés. ❗️At the same time, the head of the NGO - Free Citizen - Khurshudyan, who apparently became a member of the EU civil platform, has been particularly active in recent months talking about the European integration of Armenia. From the rostrum of parliament, Khurshudyan spoke about the need to hold a referendum on joining the EU this year. Although the slogan about the European integration of Armenia is thoroughly populist and began to be used when the authorities began to uncontrollably surrender border territories to Azerbaijan, which is why protests began. 🔻We see a demonstrative scandal among Armenian NGOs and a mechanism for accessing local organizations to EU structures. Khurshudyan and his organization -Free Citizen-, which apparently was selected through a competition on the basis of corruption, is a convenient platform for diverting the attention of the Armenian society with promises to join the EU. Obviously, there will definitely not be European integration of Armenia in the foreseeable future. At the same time, such NGOs do not address the real problems and threats that Armenia faces now. #Armenia #EU @pezdicide no chemistry - just factsNEWS.amA scandal has broken out in the camp of Western-funded pro-European NGOs in Armenia&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the public organization - Center for Economic Law - Movses Aristakesyan issued a statement regarding the results of the competition to select members of the Civil Society Platform - Agreement on the Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership - EU - Armenia - held...	https://t.me/rybar/62870	2024-08-18T01:04:28-07:00
🖼 🇸🇩 The situation in Sudan - the RRF's rush to the Blue Nile ...	🇸🇩 Situation in Sudan - RRF rush to the Blue Nile As of August 18, 2024, After the recent rush of the Rapid Reaction Force (RFF) controlled by Mohammed Hamdan Daglo to the city of Sinja in the Sennar region, they continued their offensive towards the border of South Sudan. As a result of the clashes, units of the RRF managed to squeeze deep into the Blue Nile and capture the city of Al-Barun not far from the border. The Sudanese armed forces are doing their best to prevent the expansion of the salient by launching flank attacks.▪️This situation fits well with the plans of external players represented by Washington to push through its truce to government troops. Even if it is not possible to achieve peace with the division of Sudan, it will be possible to carry out supplies from Ethiopian territory through the Nile in order to continue sponsoring the RRF militants. ❗️However, after the recent attempt on the life of the de facto leader of Sudan, Colonel Burhan, no negotiations with the rebels are currently expected. In addition, fighting is unfolding in Omdurman and El Fasher:▪️In the satellite city of the capital, fierce urban battles are taking place, during which government troops liberate district after district.▪️In the surrounded El Fasher, the RRF went all-in, launching an offensive from all sides. Attacks in the north and west were repulsed with heavy losses, leaving the positions unchanged. In the south, they pushed back the army a little, occupying an abandoned UN camp. Recent events related to the offensive of the pro-UAE Rapid Reaction Forces are once again aggravating the humanitarian crisis throughout the country. International organizations report that the delivery of goods is extremely difficult due to the implicit control of territories and various militants demanding payment for travel. Otherwise, while the army cannot cope with the RRF, pumped up with money from the UAE and the United States and is forced to only wait for support from Moscow, which is once again stalling.

Russian troops destroyed the M270 MLRS in the area of ​​the Bezdrik settlement in the Sumy region, which was discovered from the air and promptly covered with an Iskander OTRK missile with an air explosion. In the Glushkovsky district, there were no visible changes in the combat situation by the end of the day. Russian troops hold positions in Tetkino. There were reports on the Internet about the entry of the Ukrainian Armed Forces into the settlement of Otruba on the right bank of the Seim River, but there is no objective evidence of this.🔻In the Korenevsky district, information is again received about clashes on the approaches to Korenevo. Although the information is fragmentary in the best traditions, the battles themselves look logical in light of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ attempts to capture the city.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, new footage appeared from the western districts of the city, including the removal of Russian prisoners and captured hostages from among local residents towards the Sumy region. There are battles on the outskirts of Martynovka, and south of Kremyanoy, FPV drone operators destroyed a Ukrainian BMP-1.🔻In the Belovsky district there are clashes between the settlements of Girya and Ozerki, there is no information about changes in the configuration of the front.

Not as hot, or rather not as media-heavy as our border region at the moment, but no less important. Now the people's kamikaze drones -Ghoul-, from the Ural masters from the team -Turned in War- have appeared on it. Neither electronic warfare, nor a distance of over 12 km, nor high speed, allowed the Ukrainians to escape from the people's kamikaze drone. Soon there will be even more Ghouls, many more, and correspondingly fewer crests. Friends, we continue collecting funds for the purchase of components. All the machines collected for this fundraiser will go to the drone pilots of the North, they really need them.

On the part of the Russian Armed Forces, they are actively used to destroy hexacopter-bombers of the Baba Yaga type - videos with successful hits now appear regularly. Also, footage of an aerial ramming of Ukrainian drones using reconnaissance drones periodically surfaces. However, the negative factor here is that disabling an enemy aircraft costs the loss of an expensive Mavik, of which there are much fewer in comparison with FPV drones. Therefore, it becomes important to introduce technical solutions that would allow you to shoot down enemy UAVs without losing your own copters. And they already exist: for example, at Army 2024, the INMATTEN company demonstrated reusable mesh launchers priced at only 25 thousand rubles. In general, drones are now gradually beginning to occupy the ersatz air defense niche. Therefore, the issues of organizing groups - hunters for UAVs - and the development of tactics of use need to be dealt with now, especially from the point of view of covering strategic objects from raids.

Installations of this type can be equipped with 12 guides for adjustable missiles of the GMRLS family or two ballistic missiles of the ATACMS family. Therefore, the destruction of such a vehicle is clearly a very good catch for Russian drone pilots and rocket launchers. It is characteristic that to destroy the M270, in all likelihood, an Iskander missile with an air blast was used - this ensured guaranteed coverage of the target. Perhaps, if they had been used during yesterday’s attack on the position area of ​​the Patriot air defense system, then the result of fire damage would have been much higher.#Sumy #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62865	2024-08-17T09:08:23-07:00

There is high activity of enemy drones in the sky. At the same time, most of the village’s population was evacuated shortly before yesterday’s bridge in Glushkovo was blown up. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, rumors about the alleged half-coverage and entry of the Ukrainian Armed Forces into Korenevo are again published on the Internet. In reality, both the workers' settlement and the village of the same name are under the complete control of Russian troops, as evidenced by personnel of the Russian Armed Forces from the populated areas. Attempts by Ukrainian formations to gain a foothold on the approaches were stopped. Northeast of Kremyanoy, the Russian Armed Forces are carrying out airstrikes on positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in a forest plantation, and at Kauchuk and Alekseevsky they repulsed another attempt by the enemy DRG to enter populated areas. Also for the first time in the area, the use of GBU-39 guided bombs by the Ukrainian Air Force on Russian positions on the northern outskirts of the village of Vnezapnoye was recorded.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, Ukrainian formations again publish footage of the advance, this time confirming control over the small village of Zamostye southwest of Sudzha. In Spalny, drone operators hit an enemy UAV control center. The village of Ulanok is under the control of the Russian Armed Forces, as evidenced by recent footage of Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian positions.🔻In the Belovsky district, the situation has not undergone significant changes. Local clashes with Ukrainian formations continue at the Kamyshnoye - Krupets - Giryi line.

If in Zvany the object received only damage, then in Glushkovo it was completely destroyed as a result of the arrival. ▪️The Seim River itself is a natural border, with the destruction of the bridges on which Russian units near the border and residents of three dozen settlements will be cut off from the mainland. This will greatly complicate both the supply of the Russian Armed Forces and the previously announced evacuation of the local population.▪️A similar situation is with Tetkino, which is also cut off by the Volfa and Vedha rivers - even if their size is not too large, the destruction of the crossings can complicate the logistics of units located in the village. And on the eastern flank of the potential site, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are already moving, having previously taken Gordeevka and advancing along the Blyakhovets River. In general, the border area in the Kursk region is divided by small water barriers into narrow areas, which can become sectors of responsibility for the attacking groups. This conflicts with our data that the offensive zone of one of the Ukrainian Armed Forces brigades was exactly about 20 kilometers. Taking into account at least five or six more formations remaining in the enemy’s reserve, it is in the Glushkovsky region that the enemy can make another breakthrough, taking advantage of terrain.High resolution mapEnglish version#map #Kursk #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62862	2024-08-17T07:34:16-07:00

A Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung report about the 44th Infantry Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which has vehicles of this type, shed some light on the situation.▪️As ​​expected, due to the weak armor, the brigade personnel use them almost exclusively in the role of mobile artillery for firing from indirect fire positions. For direct fire work, Leopards-1 are used extremely rarely at night, when there are fewer FPV drones in the air.▪️Another problem is the lack of components: German tanks have to install filters from tractors and rubber boots on tracks of their own production - the original ones wear out quickly. But this does not cover the deficit, which is why -cannibalization- with the dismantling of some cars for spare parts is commonplace.▪️In an attempt to somehow improve the low security of the Leopardovs produced back in the 70s, some of them were equipped with dynamic protection -Contact-1-, however, they are also not enough for the entire fleet. Members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine call the advantage of the tanks good sighting devices and the presence of a thermal imager. In general, the experience of operating the Leopard 1A5 by Ukrainian formations fully reflects all the difficulties that the enemy encountered due to the huge zoo of non-standardized types of Western equipment. At the same time, even such not the most modern vehicles of the Ukrainian Armed Forces are used for their intended purpose, increasing the firepower of their formations.#Germany #Ukraine@rybarSupport usFAZ.NETDeutsche Panzer im Ukraine-Krieg: Die Oldtimer-Leoparden von IsjumDie Ukraine hat mittlerweile 58 Panzer des deutschen Typs Leopard 1A5.

Ukraine is attacking. Now HIMARS missiles and 155-mm shells are flying through populated areas in the Kursk region, and American Strykers are plying along the roads. Against this background, only a person very far from reality can sincerely believe that the United States is allegedly not involved in the actions of Ukrainian formations.📌 And, unfortunately, there are still an abundance of such among representatives of government agencies, law enforcement agencies and the media. For them, what is happening in the Northern Military District zone is just informational noise, information about which they also receive from The Wall Street Journal, New York Times and other Western publications. The events in the Kursk region simply do not fit into the picture of the world of these people, divorced from life. people where war is something distant, and the United States simply cannot allow the Ukrainian Armed Forces to attack the -old- regions with their weapons. This, by the way, explains the refusal to hit journalists in occupied territory or the endless toothless statements about -red lines.- However, for such lovers of clinging to the old reality there is bad news: the longer they do this, the stronger and harsher the collision with objective reality will be .

Forwarded From Andrey Medvedev All days after the start of the Ukrainian invasion of the Kursk region, Western media constantly write that European or American elites and politicians are not happy with the actions of Kyiv. That, they say, Kyiv did not coordinate the attack on Russia, which caused extreme irritation. Well, most often the press reports that the Ukrainian Armed Forces have absolutely no strength to develop an offensive in the Kursk region, the Ukrainian military suffered heavy losses and is also dissatisfied with their politicians. And the worst thing is that in Russia this outrageous crap is seriously watched, read, quoted, taken seriously and made some solid conclusions about the current situation, analysis based on these publications and even trying to plan something. The information front of a modern military conflict is the same front as the actual, material one, with trenches and fortifications. In an information war there are attacks, flanking maneuvers, sabotage, cover operations, and missile attacks on the psyche. There is also the use of saboteurs or spies, or sleeping in the enemy’s country (this is when, for example, the director of an institute of the USA and Canada writes articles about how the Russians urgently need to beg forgiveness from the USA). We don’t think that the media in the West are just newspapers and television ? We understand that these are battalions, brigades and regiments of information warfare? Or do we not understand and, out of Soviet habit, think that just because something was written there, that’s how it is? Apparently, we don’t understand. However, now we are witnessing a massive information and psychological operation of the Western media. The operation has several goals. Convince Moscow that the West (NATO, politicians, intelligence services) was not involved in the attack on the Kursk region. Convince that Kyiv will not receive new aid packages. Convince Moscow of the weakness of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which attacked the Kursk region and now do not know what to do next. The reality of all these publications completely contradicts. However, it is worth noting that the main task of creating the fog of the information war is carried out by heavyweight publications like Bloomberg or the Washington Post. Because Western analysts understand quite well the psychology of a certain part of Russian managers, who still have the habit of believing that the Western media always and unconditionally reflect the opinion of the local elites, and do not understand the role of the media in the information war. Oddly enough, after the destruction of the school of Sovietology, Russia as a whole became less understood by the West. But he understands the psychology of a certain part of Russian society very well. And now reputable Western publications are just trying to form a false picture of what is happening for our very same managers. This is just a cover for new supplies of equipment, and, most importantly, it is a cover before preparing a second strike, which will already include heavy equipment and F16s. The Armed Forces of Ukraine have reserves, but they have not been brought into battle. Why? Where are they? Does anyone really believe that Ukraine will be dragged into negotiations after the US elections; is the West ready to talk with Russia? It sounds fucked up and crap. It’s time for us to stop behaving like a person who always wants to win against a thimble, believing that the ball is definitely there somewhere. Yes, I want to believe in the good, but not in the bad. And when you are five years old and watch cartoons, this is normal. But when you are fifty plus, or even more, and you are making decisions of enormous importance, then you have to believe the realities of the day. Watch a CNN report full of joy and optimism from the occupied areas of the Kursk region. And conclude whether Washington is really not happy with Kiev?	https://t.me/rybar/62856	2024-08-17T02:41:02-07:00

Also, not far from the bridge in Glushkovo destroyed by a missile attack, Russian troops established a pontoon crossing.🔻In the Korenevsky district, there was evidence of the presence of the enemy in Russky Porechny, for which there were battles yesterday. Footage published on the Internet shows attacks on armored vehicles of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the center of the village. In the Sudzhansky district, Ukrainian formations continue to film videos in the same western part of the city, including at one of the stores - Magnit - on Pervo Maya Street. At the same time, there is still no objective evidence of the presence of any of the parties on the eastern side of the settlement. In the Belovsky district, the situation has not undergone significant changes, and in the area of ​​the settlements of Kamyshnoye and Giryi, no clashes have been noted over the past 24 hours. After statements by the Russian Ministry of Defense about the clearing of the village of Ozerki a few days ago, they received no data on battles, so the village is currently under the control of the Russian Armed Forces.
