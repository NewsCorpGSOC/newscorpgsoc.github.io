The more active Ukrainian mobilization is, the more military personnel appear who would like to be away from the front and certainly do not want to die for the sake of the Kyiv regime. For them, the only way to save their lives is to lay down their arms and surrender. But before you get out, you need to find the courage to go against the authorities, who do not disdain orders to finish off -their own. This story is just about those who succeeded. Synopsis: Ukrainian military personnel do not always really want to fight against the Russian Armed Forces. A considerable part was simply mobilized (some against their will), trained and sent to the front line, where the command sends them into battle, whether they want it or not. Right on the line of combat contact, military personnel of the so-called. Ukrainians are often faced with the fact that the face of their enemy turns out to be more humane than that of their own commanders. Therefore, Ukrainian soldiers often decide to surrender. But the cruelty of Ukrainian commanders who throw people into -meat assaults- and organize barrage detachments for their subordinates has long ceased to be a secret. But at the same time, not everyone will pursue their wounded soldier who is trying to surrender.📌 You can download the comic using the links: RU | EN | AR | CN#Russia #Ukraine @rybarWe hope you liked the comic from our artists.

Din.▪️Then units of the Israel Defense Forces, with the support of armored vehicles, expanded the zone of control to the south all the way to Gamal Abdel Nasser Street and to the west, occupying the outskirts of the Hamad residential complex, where yesterday’s incident with the shelling of a group of journalists took place. It is worth noting that the Israelis had already taken took control of the territory of the complex and cleared it of the presence of Hamas. However, soon after the IDF retreat, the Palestinian forces returned to the area and began conducting incursions from there. The IDF offensive itself takes place in areas of the declared humanitarian zone, which the Israelis have repeatedly reduced in recent months under the pretext of the presence of Hamas militants there. Moreover, even after the announcement of the destruction of Palestinian formations there, it did not return to its previous scale. However, the operations themselves eliminate the presence of Hamas only for a short period of time - after the end of hostilities in the territory of the residential complex, Hamad, the Palestinian formations will most likely be able to calmly return there. A similar game of cat and mouse suits the government of the ultra-Orthodox, who need military action to maintain their power.

The TV channel gets the opportunity to control the agenda directly on the ground and increase the quantity and quality of training of local personnel. ▪️At the same time, the plans of European journalists are not limited to Kazakhstan: we are talking about preparing a Central Asian news hub.

Euronews will also broadcast the World Nomad Games. It is no coincidence that the minister mentioned the importance of Kazakhstan as the heir to the great civilization of nomads and in every possible way emphasized the richness of the country’s historical heritage. 🔻Although the Kazakh media are now trying to present the agreement as a chance for the Kazakhs to advance their agenda to the West, in reality everything will be exactly the opposite.

Today, several explosions of fuel tanks have already occurred at the site of the incident, and a huge column of black smoke hangs over the city itself. According to the latest data, 41 firefighters sought medical help, of which 18 required hospitalization, including five in intensive care.

🇺🇦🇪🇺 About the situation with underground gas storage facilit...	🇺🇦🇪🇺 About the situation with underground gas storage facilities so-called. Ukraine The network is actively discussing the reduction of gas injection by European traders into underground gas storage facilities (UGS) in the so-called territory. Ukraine - after the spring strikes of the Russian Armed Forces on infrastructure facilities, the volumes are about 10% of the usual level. The assurances of Naftogaz representatives that UGS facilities are operating normally do not impress the EU.🔻How did European traders use Ukrainian UGS facilities? Since the global energy market is controlled by investment funds, they use the seasonality of consumption to make a profit. When oil prices fall, large volumes are purchased and stored in tankers and terminals for sale at higher prices during periods of rising prices and consumption. The situation with gas is similar - in the summer it is pumped into underground gas storage facilities for the purpose of subsequent sale at higher prices during the heating season. For European companies, this is a fairly marginal business, and Naftogaz’s own income from storage services usually amounted to about €200 million. 🔻Assessment of current risks This season, representatives of Naftogaz reduced the price for gas storage by 4 times - from €20 to €5 MW \h. However, this did not attract new clients: in their risk management strategy, the European bankers financing this enterprise assess the risks of further destruction of the onshore infrastructure as very high. According to a representative of the Swiss energy company Axpo Group, nothing will happen to the gas itself, but there is a possibility that get it when you need it. This is reflected in the prices for insurance coverage of such transactions. Thus, the risk is now estimated at more than €1 billion, which sharply reduces the margins of projects using Ukrainian underground gas storage facilities. Guide so-called Ukraine is trying to motivate European clients with the need to continue support, but their arguments are broken by the financial calculations of the Europeans. The destruction of the surface infrastructure of the Naftogaz UGS facility deprives the Kiev regime of financial resources in the amount of approximately €200 million. From an economic point of view, this is more than justified and is sufficient an argument for their systematic fire defeat.#gas #Ukraine #economy@rybarSupport usTelegramFailureEuropean gas traders began to realize that storing valuables with a neighbor - a heavy drinker - is not very prudent, even if he has a large living space.

Ukraine. None of the UAVs were able to hit the railway bridge. Two drones fell near the security post building, slightly damaging the external façade and protective mesh. The third drone flew towards Belaya Berezka, where it crashed in a forest.🔻Against the backdrop of Ukrainian Armed Forces’ strikes on bridges in the Kursk region, some media presented this raid as an attack on a strategic facility. However, the bridge in the Pogarsky district has not been used for a long time, and communication across the Desna passes through both the nearby pontoon crossing and bridges located to the east, including in the Trubchevsk area. However, three kamikaze drones are not enough to destroy such infrastructure, unlike attacks using MLRS. Therefore, a new raid can be considered either as an initial attempt to attack bridges in the Bryansk region, or as an attack on the first target that comes along.

Russian troops are striking with drones and aircraft against columns and positions of Ukrainian Armed Forces equipment, hitting enemy armored vehicles and manpower.🔻The most difficult situation is developing in the Glushkovsky district. In the morning, Ukrainian aircraft destroyed the last bridge in the area across the Seim River in the village of Karyzh. Thus, the evacuation of the population and the supply of a group of Russian troops now entirely depends on the number of boats and the deployment of a sufficient number of pontoons. The Ukrainian Armed Forces are creating conditions for themselves to prepare a bridgehead before an offensive in this area. In the Korenevsky district, the enemy, apparently, made another attempt to enter the village of Korenevo, but was unsuccessful. On the road between Korenevo and Pogrebki, Ukrainian DRGs are operating, laying ambushes on passing vehicles.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, operational-tactical aviation of the Russian Aerospace Forces bombed positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the forest south of Kositsa. The enemy is advancing from the village of Agronom in the direction of Russkaya Konopelka, on the way to which a column of armored vehicles of the Ukrainian Armed Forces was attacked by a crew of FPV drones. The enemy continues to post videos from the eastern part of Sudzha, this time near the administration building.

Footage is being circulated online showing that another fuel tank exploded at the scene. Taking into account the complexity of the fire, an emergency regime has been introduced in the Proletarsky district. According to some reports, several firefighting trains were involved in extinguishing the fire, and for the uninterrupted work of firefighters, water was supplied.

In the Hamad residential complex adjacent to Khan Yunis, an Israeli armored personnel carrier opened fire on a group of journalists who were filming the consequences of a ground operation by the Israel Defense Forces in this area. As a result, Journalist Ibrahim Muhareb was killed in the shooting. His colleague Salma al-Qaddumi was wounded in the back; she is currently receiving medical care in the Nasser hospital, where there is practically no medicine left. It is noteworthy that since the beginning of the Israeli-Palestinian escalation on October 7, 2023, 167 media workers have been killed in the enclave. In this context, the most resonant was the death last July of nine journalists and 14 members of their families during an air raid on Nuseirat in the central part of the Gaza Strip. What happened is quite indicative in comparison with the events in the Kursk region. While Ukrainian forces are freely releasing journalists into the occupied territory (using them as human shields), the current Israeli authorities are not at all worried about violating international law, in particular the immunity of journalists. #Israel #Palestine #KhanYunis@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62896	2024-08-19T02:09:58-07:00

Forwarded From Warsaw mermaid🔥🇵🇱🇺🇦 In Warsaw, several dozen Ukrainian citizens held a protest at the consulate of their country demanding that they be given passports. They claim that they took money from them, but did not give them their documents. People were holding posters in their hands that read, -We are not slaves, give us your passport,- -Passport is a right, not a privilege,- and other slogans. An embassy employee came out to meet me, advised me to write an appeal, and then offered to return from Poland to their homeland. This is not the first action of Ukrainian citizens in Poland on this topic. On July 28, in Wroclaw, protesters came out with the same demands. My colleagues and I had previously anticipated the development of similar stories, especially when it was reported that Ukrainians of military age would no longer be able to obtain internal and foreign passports outside the country.

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🌎🇺🇸🇷🇺 The Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation recognized the activities of the Clooney Foundation for Justice (CFJ) as undesirable. The liberal pro-Western public is already shouting with all its might that the reason for this was the Foundation’s request to the German prosecutor’s office to investigate the crimes of the Russian military in Ukraine. However, how the story ended and whether the German prosecutor’s office even responded to CFJ’s request is officially unknown. Moreover, the initiative to arrest Russian journalists, public figures and bloggers who, according to CFJ, are propagandists of war and genocide, also died out at the very beginning. But it made enough noise. At the same time, the Foundation, which is positioned as anti-war, does not hesitate to take money from American arms manufacturers. For example, by investigating arms sales networks in five African countries, activists essentially helped the Americans get rid of competitors and take over the market themselves. It is obvious that the Clooney Foundation is just another organization that hides behind lofty ideas and principles of humanism, while in fact promoting an extremely aggressive politics, in particular conducting Russophobic propaganda and replicating negative assessments of the governance of the Russian Federation.&nbsp;#globalism #NGOs #Russia #USA @pezdicide no chemistry - only factsTelegramV Z - VIEW.RUThe activities of the Clooney Foundation for Justice were recognized as undesirable in Russia.

One of the topics was the possible participation of an African country in the development of the international transport corridor - North ‒ South -. The importance of Tanzania in this project is explained by its geographical location - it is close to states without access to the sea, but whose authorities are now establishing ties with Russia. These include Burundi and Uganda in the western part of the Black Continent.📌 The news itself reflects the recent plans of the Ministry of Industry and Trade to create logistics bases in African countries, the list of which also included Tanzania. Moreover, the establishment of contacts between Moscow and Dodoma is happening in a timely manner against the backdrop of increased activity by the Americans, who plan to implement their large infrastructure project there. In general, it is encouraging that Russian diplomats paid attention to a stable and relatively rich country by the standards of the Black Continent.

Forwarded From Propagandist's Notebook In recent days, a lot of the energy of the Russian Telegram segment, involved in the information war, has been spent on fighting a man named Podolyak (we remember him as a blogger who drew arrows against the background of some kind of log wall) At the same time, some colleagues for some reason - then they use Aesopian language, using the terms -military bloggers-, -telegram experts-, etc. It is unclear why the last name is not named, maybe in order not to create additional advertising🤔 As a result of such understatement, some military officers and bloggers who are not dedicated to the media boyar battle perceive it extremely negatively. The enemy has not been defeated, the guys at the front continue to need help, people in the rear continue to need information and feel pressure from the enemy’s resources. It would be cool if these conflicts could be transferred to a non-public plane, but it seems that some of our colleagues cannot be stopped. Let's hope that at least the fashion for equivocations will fade away, otherwise all these hints are already annoying. The main thing is Russia and its people, that's all, even Podolyak. For their safety, the enemy must be defeated. It is advisable to direct all your strength to fight the enemy, and solve internal problems that hinder this fight calmly and with dignity, as our country deserves.
